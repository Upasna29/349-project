Even if it's not perfect, it's still what we waited so long.\nWell, where to start. Once apon a time in the year of 2007, on anonymous imageboard 2ch.ru (now closed) one of the visitors posted a picture he draw, of a young girl with blonde hair. People liked it, so he draw more pictures of her. Later, he moved to another imageboard, and with other talented people decided to make a game. It should have been an adult game with USSR-attributes, becase many people grown-up while there was USSR, and had a good memories about their youth.\nWell, it was easier to decide than to do. They started. And there was a lot of promises. A lot of waiting. A lot of drama. Changes in the team. Leaking of not ready game. A LOT OF EVERYTHING. So, when, after all this years, game was published to steam, a lot of people was like "Wow! They really did it!".\nNow, the reason why I writing this review. Should you, or should not, play it? Well, if you wondered what is "imageboard", never leaved in ex-USSR countries or just don't like visual novels - probably not. Not that you can't like it, it's about feelings, that is the same for everyone. Also, you probably should not play it, if you expect just a game with lot of boobs. It has gone far from the original idea of adult game, and even though it has boobs, and you may even find adult-patch in the internet, it's still not the main theme of game.\nIf you are (or ever was) alone, if you live (or ever lived) in ex-USSR countries, if you ever visited imageboards (or even still do) - you can really enjoy this game, I recommend it to you. Or even if you just curious to see, what non-professional developers can do. And if you waited too long for this game to be made - you probably already played it)\nNow, something about this game, not connected to this story.\nGraphics\nGraphics has problems. It's not because it's bad, but because many people worked on this game on different time, so you  can see the difference between scenes. Not a big problem, but I needed to say about it to impartial. And the backgrounds is so beautiful, you may play the game just to see it!\nMusic\nI don't afraid to say that soundtrack for this game is brilliant. I just love the main theme, based on soviet pioneer's anthem. I hope you would enjoy it too.\nPlot\nWell, as often in indie projects, it's the weak spot of the game. Nice idea, a lot of good humor (but many of it connected to imageboards, so not everyone would understand it. And I have no idea, how good english translation is), and the target audience would certainly share the feelings of characters. But... holes in the plot, unjustified twists, and other mistakes of a beginning story-teller can spoil you some fun. I still like it, because I somehow belong to the target audience, you know :)\nSummary\nOh, whatever, just play it already, it's free. Even if you have nothing to do with imageboards, never was neither young nor lonely, and believe russians have a pet-bears and wear hats with ear flaps whole year long - there is still something in the game you may like)","November 27, 2015","true","24.1"," 251 of 261 people (96%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","96","251","261","46","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GentlemenWeLoveWar/recommended/331470/","GentlemenWeLoveWar","石井四郎","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GentlemenWeLoveWar/","462 products in account","Everlasting Summer is a visual novel that was developed by a group of enthusiasts over a long span of five years. You could call it russian Katawa Shoujo because those games have similar origin: while KS was developed by anons from ♥♥♥♥♥, ES originated from iichan - one of main russian imageboards (the game itself at first was called 'iichan eroge'). But when Four Leaf Studios explore themes of maturing, entering the adult world and self-identity in society, iichan eroge team took a different, rather specific path. And that path will define whether you will like this game or not.\n\nPoint is, Everlasting Summer plays on your sense of nostalgia. But only if you have something to relate it to. Have you ever been in summer camps? Have you ever been that geeky mediocre guy with little to none friends whose only superpower is being invisible to girls? Have you ever felt that you wasted your youth chatting/s--tposting with anonymous strangers online? Have you ever felt that you need to change something in your life but you need a little push? Well, then this game is for you. Strap on and prepare for FEELs trip.\n\nIn terms of quality, Everlasting Summer proves that 'amateur' doesn't mean bad. Even by professional standards, music by Sergey Eybog and 'Between August and September' and background art by ArceniXC in this game are outstanding. Sprites and event CGs are lagging behind, but still aren't bad. The only thing I didn't like is extra route that tries to tie everything together and explain some plotholes but it is clear that the scriptwriter tried to jump over his head - that explanation is confusing, boring, out of place and totally uncalled for.\n\nOverall this is a great game and you should definitely give it a chance, be you new to visual novels or a hardcore VN-otaku fluent in moonspeak.\n\nAt this point, I can't say anything about translation because I played this game right after release in 2013 when there was no english translation (well, not that I would when russian is my native language). But I'll give it a try and update my review.","November 19, 2014","true","8.4"," 286 of 312 people (92%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","92","286","312","8","10"

The premise is that you are a twenty-something internet addict with no friends and passions, who get sucked in a 1980 Pioneer Camp, the Soviet version of boy/girl scouts, before the Berlin Wall collapse. Trying to understand what the hell happened to you and how to get out from the Past you got stuck into turns out to be only half of your quest, while the other half is, of course, getting acquainted with all the girls in the camp, have sex with them, and live amazing things you couldn't experience in your actual, dull, apathetic timeline. Over the course of 7 days you will make some sparse choices that will decide what ending you get access too. This is weird cause at first it totally looks like you couldn't choose much, but the game has 13 VERY different endings and I would say that this is where it shines.\n\nI got undeniably hooked when I realized how different the story can get based on what "branch" you pick. The problem is that without a guide, and after your first clean playthrough, it isn't clear at all how to get into a different branch or what you could have done differently. But as soon as you try to get a little deeper into the mechanics you'll realize the amount of story(es), for a game of this kind, is quite huge. This doesn't change the fact that Everlasting Summer is definitely too long in some sections and the writing is uneven at best, which might have to do with a different cultural style from what I am used to, I'm not sure. The different endings though, including a few crazy ones, are interesting and while some interactions and dialogues are beyond childish, there are also times when you can appreciate the education background of the writers.\n\nThe characters get more interesting through replays, since the first trip through the 7 days don't leave much room for their personalities, but whenever you take a different branch you get to know them better. As I mentioned before, this is the strength of the game: the 13 endings paint a whole picture. I am not a completionist but this is one case where you can only really say you finished the game when you got all the endings since only then you will really know Sovionok Camp and the story of the guy who got trapped into it.\n\nThe character design is weird at first, as pretty much everything that wants to look Japanese but it's not Japanese, but you'll get used to it soon and will probably appreciate it after a while, and the background pictures/paintings are honestly beautiful. Finally, the 1980s Soviet Union setting is just unbeatable.\n\nDon't forget to download the Hentai patch from the official website, since the Steam version will just give you a black screen where you are supposed to see sex or breasts. It is not much at all, this is not a hentai game, but it's better to see all the stuff instead of censorship blankness.","January 2, 2015","true","24.3"," 137 of 146 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","137","146","12","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH/recommended/331470/","WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH","Da Warboss Biff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH/","344 products in account","Everlasting Summer is a free-to-play animesque visual novel, created by Soviet Games.\n\nThe game has a pretty standart gameplay as far as visual novels go: there is a static picture that depicts your current surroundings, character sprites are placed on that picture, you read dialogues, sometimes you get to make a decision. There are few notable exceptions to that rule, but this is generally what you would expect from the game.\n\nEverlasting Summer is extremely story-rich, one playthrough has an average span of seven in-game days, each day takes aproximately one-two hours to read through. There is an average number of 5 decisions to make per day that do have an impact on the story (so much there are actually 13 endings to discover). On top of that, ending of Day 5 and the following days are completely unique to the ending you're heading to. You will have to play through all of them to discover all secrets of the story.\n\nStory itself starts out like this: protagonist is a young man in his early 20s named Semyon (Sam). He's has almost no social life. He lives on his parents' money. He spends all day in the internet. He has no will to change anything.\nOne day he takes a bus that for some reason takes him through time to 80s, to a pioneer camp "Sovionok" ("Owlet"). Semyon then has to find answers. Why did he end up here? How to get out of this place? Does he even need to get out of here...?\n\nMost of the time you interact with 10 very well written characters that may or may not have a secret agenda related to your situation. The game packs a train of feels that it will happily unleash on you. Guilttrips, ahoy!\n\nLet me give you a list of pros and cons:\n\n+ Interesting non-linear multi-ending story\n+ Heavy emotional investment is guaranteed\n+ Amazing soundtrack\n+ Beautiful scenery and well-drawn character sprites\n+ A lot of references to russian culture, mostly internet culture (protagonist's name, posters in pioneers' houses, bus 410, protagonist's thoughts sometimes)\n\n- There are a few screamers (how many depends on the ending you're heading for, but at least one is guaranteed). Normaly I would just laugh at these attempts to scare the player but in the overall upbeat mood these manage to scare effectively.\n- Steam has removed adult content (can be restored with an easy to install patch). That's not neccesarily a bad thing, adult content ruins the mood in some moments but black screens infuriate me personally.\n- Action parts are few and even then you just read through them, doing nothing yourself. Those who are looking for action gameplay - look elsewhere.\n\nHopefully, I managed to interest you. A few words of advice:\nDon't you dare read any guides that reveal plot elements, play for the first time without using any guides, even spoilerless ones.\nDon't even approach Lena on your first playthrough  you're guaranteed to score an extremely depressing ending if you do it wrong. In fact, if you consider yourself an emotional person I suggest that you just read about her endings after you finish the game for the first time, it will make you feel extremely depressed if you play it yourself.\nYou will probably see it in every other review, but I'll repeat these wise words: don't play Miku's ending at night.\n\nTo sum up, I definetly recommend to give this game a try, since it's free.\n\nHave fun, pioneers!","December 2, 2014","true","287.3"," 124 of 130 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","124","130","5","14"

The music fits the mood, so the atmosphere in game is great. The background pictures are very beautiful, but character pictures wasn't that great.

The protagonist represented almost everything I felt about my life to this date. He is man with no self-identifiable talents, skills, or ambitions. He is an adult who can’t find his place in the world and passes his life in front of a computer screen. It was almost overwhelming to read my life described by a complete stranger, yet somewhat comforting at the same time.\n\nThe story is set up with a dream sequence followed by an internal monologue which succeeds in placing you in the mind of the protagonist.  It is abruptly after this that some unusual circumstances place the protagonist in a situation where he is completely removed from his daily routine. After falling asleep on a bus in the city, in winter, he wakes up in an unfamiliar location in the summer. He finds himself at entrance to a mysterious soviet camp, populated mainly by girls. It is ultimately up to him, with the assistance of the player, to discover how and why these events came to pass, while forging relationships with the campers along the way.\n\nThe music and scenery are wonderful and achieve the correct mood for each scene. Knowing very little about Russia I found the locations to be unique and interesting especially compared to the Japanese games I'm accustomed to. The character designs, which are modelled after anime style, displayed a lot of effort and talent from the designers.  The usual character archetypes are present allowing the player to experience a variety of different personalities among the campers. Additionally the player is provided with a reasonable amount of choices throughout the story, which is something I have found lacking from many visual novels. Multiple story paths and steam achievements add further replay value to the game, and I will endeavour to experience the entire story over multiple play throughs. The only downfall I can find is some issues with spelling and translation, but these do not hinder the story and could be fixed with a small patch.\n\nEverlasting Summer is a masterpiece and I am thankful that the team behind it gave us an English release. I was even more thankful that it was release for free. Given the option I would have happily paid for a game of this quality.","November 20, 2014","true","27.2"," 113 of 127 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","113","127","0","0"

Then this game does not suit you at all... You can try to give a long or short review on Everlasting Summer - but no matter how many words are used for this... it is not possible to describe this the way it deserves)\n\nFirst of all, I did not know that there even exist so-called Visual Novels (VN, as I heard).\nOr to be more precisely, that this is the name for it.\n\nAs I read the description of ES, I thought this will be the typical japano-dating-game-style. As a kid I once liked them a lot, but now I would have immediately lost all interest of this game... but thanks to the other reviews.\nThey were in a way that positive, I was so curious about this game - I had to download it. And this was one of the best decisions in my life!\n\nYou are Semyon - a grown-up-man who managed to get into a pioneers camp. In the 80's. You are much younger now - 17 years old - and have no idea how you came there and what you shall do to return to your proper life.\n\nThis question is constantly in the narrators mind... but you have not much time to search for answers. In the camp there are other pioneers, always trying to have a talk to you and there is a camp leader which personal slave 24/7 you seem to be. Quite annoying, huh?\n\nMy first opinion while playing this game was like "what the ?! I do not have many options to decide on... at which point can I influence the story???"\nAfter some hours I started to realize: I do have some options, maybe quite a lot [and you have a lot!] but the passages between my decisions are so well and lovely written that it seems as an eternity first... but as continuing ES you get caught by the story and you CANNOT stop reading this. (30 hours playtime in 4 days do speak its own language)\n\nAs it behaves when you finish a good book, the same it does when finishing ES. You are happy of the time you spent with it, but you feel sad as if you have lost a very good friend.\n\nAfter my first playthrough, I went back to the reviews again... and what did I read? 13 different endings?!?\n13??\nSo you really have a lot of influence to the story...\n\nSo I started to play this again... and again... and it just got more interesting!\nYou learn so much new about each character and its behaviour, you learn a lot more of how and why this happens. And you really, really have to complete each ending to understand what is going on.\n\nI just finished with this piece of glamorous art and I am happy... satisfied.\n\nYou do understand the behaviour of the protagonist more, the older you are yourself. Often you catch yourself compairing to him, because many aspects just fit to you - big compliment to the creators of the game.\n\nWell as I do not want to tell too much about the details, I think I'm done with my first real review of a game.\nIf you managed to come this far: thank you for reading\nand:\ndownload this game. It is for free, and it seems to interest you that much that you read through my review!!!\n\nWhen something is that catchy, that you feel uncomfortable when you have to stop with it, then it has to mean a lot...\n\n10/10\n\n\n\nEdit: it's been about 9 months since playing this game and i'm still catching myself sitting in the car listening to this soundtrack","January 25, 2015","true","36.6"," 82 of 94 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","82","94","3","8"

I can´t say that I didn´t like the girls Endings, but they where ... well,  sort of okayish at best. As a Horror-fan I definetely liked the Sasha/Miku Route. But Yulyas route ... well, that one has been in full cry. I guess it´s almost safe to say, that we´ve got one of the games here, which becomes better the older YOU are when you´re playing it. Perhaps its just a personal thing - I don´t really know, nor do I actually care - but, I suppose the older you are, the more you have actually experienced in your life, the more you´ll be able to understand what the protagonist is thinking about, what is bothering him. On the other hand - it actually manages it, to give you this slight nostalgic feeling. Which is interesting in a certain way .... I grew up in western Germany, in the late 1980s I was a little bit younger than Semyon. I should not really be able to compare my expiriences to the life of an adolescent in the late years of the sovient union. It might be a side effect of this game, a wanted thing - or whatever you prefer to call it ... but darn, I can relate. It sort of feels familiar. Okay, it wasn´t called Pioneers - we had boy scouts, like in the states. But ♥♥♥♥, some memories surely came back. It actually leads me to some sort of conclusion, I´ve had heard some while ago: It doesn´t matter where you live, where you´ve grown up - the basic hopes, wishes and desires remain the same - anywhere. So - I´d like to tip my hat to the developers, for granting us an interesting experience here and I hope this won´t be that last game we see from you.","December 23, 2014","true","23.4"," 77 of 88 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","77","88","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toggeni/recommended/331470/","Toggeni","和文","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Toggeni/","185 products in account","This is an Visual Novel so if you're not interesting in spending hours on reading dialogue and the thoughts of the main character then this is not a game for you.\nAfter having read all of the endings that this VN has to offer I can say that this is an amazing one.\n\nTL:DR Just play it it's worth your time, it got great art, music and an really interesting storyline.\n\nPros:\nNot too short and not too long, keeps the reader interested and the different routes isn't that similar to eachother.\nOutstanding soundtrack\nThe main character is actually interesting.\nDetailed and beautiful BG and CG with an unique artstyle\nChoices aren't too few but neither too many, an overall interesting and fun flowchart.\nIt's made by RussiansThe graphics suffers from having many different artstyles and can seem inconsistent. This can be seen as both a Pro and Con. I personally enjoyed this aspect of the VN.\nThere isn't many cons but it does exist a few minor problems.\nCons\nThe sprites does look quite bland and isn't close to as good looking as the rest of the art.\nThe english translation suffers from quite many spelling misstakes and probably grammar misstakes aswell.\n(I do not have english as my 1st language so I'm not the best one to judge that.)\nIt can sometimes lag because of the Ren'py engine, especially while fast forwarding.\nIf you are russian or atleast know russian you will probably get a better experience from reading this.\nThe steam achievements doesn't unlock correctly. Ths doesn't really affect the VN but it can be annoying for people who wants all of the achievements.\n\nGraphics 7/10\nI have alot of mixed feelings when it comes to the graphics. One part of me wants to say that it's a masterpiece another wants to think it's mediocre and bland. Both of them are though correct. The backgrounds are really beautiful, great colouring, shading and attention to detail. The main menu looks great and is unique. The CG wich is only meant to be seen in specific scenes looks really unique and has this more sketchy and abstract artstyle, they don't have that much detail but the colours and composition just makes it look amazing. The one thing that makes me give the graphics a 7 and not a 9 or even a 10 is the sprites of the characters. They are the things you will see most of the time and they just look uninteresting and just generally mediocre and nothing special. It still looks good but seeing how great the CG and BG is then it's sad that the sprites drag them down.\n\nSound and effects 9/10\nThe sound effects is great. They manage to use them at the correct time to set an great atmosphere. It really does enhance the experience alot. One example is that they use the sound of grasshoppers alot to make a more unsettling feeling or make the characters just feel annoyance, probably inspired by Higurashi.\n\nSoundtrack 10/10\nThe music is just perfect. The first time I opened up this VN I got stuck on the main menu just listening to the main menu theme. The soundtrack is devided into two parts, the bright side and the dark side. The differents parts is made by different people. They truly create diversity in soundtrack with more classical music, rock and some more modern music. It really complements the story and helps create the correct atmosphere and emotions. I don't think I will ever get tired of listening to this soundtrack.\n\nCharacters 8/10\nThe characters is mainly your normal harem clichés. The caring and loving one is there, the tsundere one and ofcourse the mischievous loli is there aswell. But even if you have seen similar characters elsewhere they all feel new and interesting. All of them is really well-written and makes you want to come back to the VN to read all of their routes. Their graphical design is really nice and fresh, they really isn't your typical japanese manga characters.\n\nStory 10/10\nThe story is the main attraction and luckily it's also the best part (maybe beaten by the soundtrack). It's well-written and feels unique and fresh. All of the routes is interesting, the characters and events is perfectly made. The story might seem like your normal slice-of-life VN but if you see past of that skin you'll see a more philosophical and surreal story. Putting this VN in a genre can be hard, is it a slice-of-life, a horror, maybe even a sci-fi? The routes are ineresting and worthwhile alone but to truly appreciate this story you need to read all of them and look at the whole picture. At all of the metaphors it uses and the philosophical meaning behind it. The VN uses alot of references to other games, animes etc. so to be able to enjoy it to the fullest you need to have some knowledge about that. I think I personally have missed out on alot of inside-jokes and references since I'm not russian or can read russian. So If you can read russian I would recommend to read the russian version instead of the english translation.\n\nOverall experience  10/10\nOverall this is an amazing visual novel and it's one of the best I have read, and I have read quite a few. It is by far the best VN you will find on steam and it even has the perk of being free. I would recommend this to anyone even if you aren't used to VNs or other things this might refer to. You will be able to enjoy it, maybe not to the fullest but it will still be an great experience.\nThis is an eroge so there will be sexscenes, though you need to download the hentai patch from their website.\nHentai patch can be found here [everlastingsummer.su]\nThough I do not think the eroge scenes really are needed, they are all very short and some of them feel very out of place.\nIf you decide to read this VN wich I think you should then I can promise that you won't be disappointed.","February 8, 2015","true","72.9"," 52 of 55 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","52","55","0","4"

Wspaniała. Cudowna.\nIncredible. Great. Wonderful.\nНевероятно. Отлично. Замечательно.\n10/10\n\nThis game transfered me to my childhood. It brought back a lot of my memories. Summer camps, first love, heart dilemmas, hard decisions (in young person opinion).\nEverlasting Summer gives such feelings in a great way, especially that i was teenager in 80s :)\nStories told in the game are very interesting. There are plenty endings depending on our choices during the game. Some of them are really surprising.\nAlso music is worth mentioning which helps to build the atmosphere in this production. Few melodies will stay in my head for a longer time. Can't say anything bad about graphics. The pictures are very nicely drawn.\nFurthermore, the game shows that our decisions have consequences in the future. They can affect the fate of others, even in a tragic way, so we should think twice before saying/doing anything. Much depends on the nature of the other person, but we are able to hurt anybody.\nI highly recommend this game, especially to the older generation of players.\n\nMnie ta gra przeniosła w czasie do moich lat młodości. Obudziła wiele wspomnień. Letnie obozy, pierwsze miłości, rozterki sercowe, trudne decyzje (jak na tamten wiek).\nGra niesamowicie oddaje ten klimat, tym bardziej, że nastolatkiem byłem właśnie w latach 80-tych :)\nOpowiedziane w grze historie są bardzo interesujące. Zależnie od naszych wyborów mamy różne zakończenia gry. Niektóre z nich są bardzo zaskakujące.\nNa wyróżnienie zasługuje również muzyka, która tworzy bardzo fajny klimat. Kilka melodii bardzo zapadło mi w pamięć. Podobnie grafika, która jest bardzo ładnie narysowana.\nGra pokazuje ponadto, że nasze decyzje mają konsekwencje w przyszłości. Mogą one wpłynąć na los innych osób, nawet w tragiczny sposób. Nasze postępowanie nie jest bez znaczenia, dlatego czasem trzeba się zastanowić, zanim coś zrobimy lub powiemy. Wiele zależy od charakteru drugiej osoby, ale skrzywdzić można każdego.\nSerdecznie polecam tą grę, szczególnie starszemu pokoleniu graczy.","November 28, 2014","true","29.9"," 68 of 80 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","68","80","0","1"

Скачать новеллу меня подтолкнули мемасы и новости из групп контакта. И я им чертовски благодарен, без них я бы не открыл для себя этот великолепный мир "Совёнка".\nОписывать БЛ можно бесконечно, поскольку у определённого круга лиц игра вызовет бурю эмоций. К сожалению, я слишком бесчувственный (а ещё чмо и быдло), и я не испытал такого всплеска, но, мать твою, что-то в моей чёрствой душе шевельнулось. Прошёл год, и "Совёнок" уже не так цепляет меня, но до сих пор про прочтении отдельных фрагментов в груди появляется странное щемящее (такое слово вообще есть?) чувство, а при прослушивании шедеврального саундтрека я вновь с головой погружаюсь в эту бесподобную атмосферу. Лето навсегда оставило частичку себя во мне. Я даже гитару купил только из-за БЛ.\nДа, это даже не обзор, а скорее подведение итогов спустя год после первого запуска, вызванное острым приступом графомании... но мне как-то похуй на самом деле нет. Играть стоит явно не всем, но если ты забитый хмырь, уверенный, что у тебя никогда не будет девушки - то эта игра для тебя. Она поможет тебе осознать всю твою ущербность и заставит плакать от того, что с тобой не произойдёт такого чуда в виде волшебного 410-го автобуса.

I never hated them but never really thought it was for me.\n\nAnyways this game kinda changed that. Sure there's women with large breasts and sex if you add the hentai patch. However the focus is on the characters and the relatively mature themes of what to do with life, the nature of existence, and the excellent plot, and most importantly, the effects of one's actions on others. The writing apart from the funky translation is good, but if you've talked to actual russian girls they tend to say things the same way so there's a degree of veracity to it.\n\nThis ties in well with the nice soundtrack and excellent background art.\n\nAlso of note is that each ending really has a different message and life lesson. Is it a little corny? sure, but at the same time it feels like it was a good use of my time and made me really feel. Not only one emotion, but probably every ending will bring a different range of emotions.\n\nThen once you've finished all the basic girl endings, the game takes that and throws it out the window. It goes to almost Tarkovsky levels of insanity and mind/reality bending and will make you super confused. Think through it for an hour, put the pieces together and you'll realise the developers were either blackout drunk or genius when they wrote the overarching story.

I saw the Pictures on\nsteam and the trailer witch are pretty nice so i taught lets give it a shot, its free anyway!\nAlthough this is not that kind of game that i usually play. ( no guns! ) Reading from the steam page the only thing yure doing in this game is reading\nwith ongoing mouse klicking. Yeha right, i thaught i might dump it from my Hardrive\nif it gets boring right away! After installing it i jumped right into it, on the fist half of my very first walkthrough\ni got a bit bord but on the second half i just got hit from a emotion-sledgehammer. (ok, maybe i am exaggerateing but i'd like the phrase) To summ things up I really enjoyd it!\n\nComming to the main part of  my Review, The game is only available in english and russian,\ntranslations are made by the comunity so upcomming translation mods might not be 100%\nGramatical right. But reading is not the only thing for you to enjoy, the music in this game is\nBREATHTAKING! I absolutely adore it ! It takes the atmosphaere of this game to the next lvl\nmaking me shiver serval times. The background  sounds are also great, fitting the current location and Situiation very well. Speaking of background, the locations are beautiful drawn so it never\ngets old watching them once in a while. However characters in this game look a litte bit\nodd, not badly drawn but the artstlye is some kind of a crossover between a japanese dog and an Russian one. Don't get me wrong i like it, an more japanese looking one won't fit\nthe interesting Sovjet Setting. Moveing on to the story wich is the Backbone of this\ngame so leave it, if it isn't interesting to you. Lucky this is pretty hard due to a\nwellthaught and  fascinating story. Providing a lot of different genre typs on each\n13 endings/Paths: romance, adventure, mystery, drama and even Horror. Sadly only half\nof them are uniqe and you need to play the story from the beginning to do other\nchoices and get another endig. Sometimes you can save before the ending\nand collect the other one if you choose different. All in all i recomend to achieve\nthem completely so you get the wahole story together. After 6 hours of trying and\nfailing i allowed myself the rudeness to look up all remainig endings on YT.\nAdmittedly it would be boring it its so easy to get all endings. Finally\nyou can pick up lots of new storys on the Steam Workshop if youre\nhungry for more, watchout though most of them are only in russian\navailable. If you are a fan like i am you can support the developer\nby buying the ingame music on itunes and google play.\nTo end this review ladys and Gentleman just play it by yourself\nits absultely worth your time and free, i strongly recommend to\npick it up!\n\nPS: DISCARD THAT NIFE LENA!!!!","March 14, 2015","true","82.3"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","44","52","4","2"

Yakov Smirnoff, 1980-something...\n\nIf you're into this kind of game, you'll probably enjoy it. I'm not a fan of this kind of stuff, but the unique setting/concept and price (FREE!) drew my interest. It's a typical anime-styled visual novel thing. Except that it's set in a Soviet Pioneer (their version of the Boy/Girl Scouts) camp.\n\nTranslation is a bit rough in spots, but you can always make out what was meant from the context. Most of it is translated correctly, sometimes it's just typos and words substituting for homonyms or words they're spelled like. Devs say they're working on the translation, I'll be that's going to take some volunteers some time. What they did really well is explain various Soviet/Russian cultural references.\n\nThing to know though, everything in this game is seen through the lens of one of those Japanese boarding schoool anime type shows/games. Rebellious girl gets chewed out by the camp leader for tying her her shirt up Daisy Duke-style, but every third character has her hair dyed blue, green or another unlikely-there-back-then color. Unless Hot Topic imported Manic Panic from East Germany after the wall came down...\n\nI might have preferred a bit more feeling what it might have been like living in the Soviet Union at the time (and ya know, not have it be written by someone with an agenda). It actually does some of that a bit better than you might expect it to.","December 13, 2014","true","79.0"," 35 of 40 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","35","40","0","3"

Go download this unforgettable experience right flippin' now. You will not regret it. Everything is so great about this if you have the time to dwell deeper in to the story and not just stop after one playthrough. It will just leave you empty. Trust me! The game is worth every hour you play it.\n\nEverlasting Summer - an unforgettable experience rather than your regular visual novelI never thought a game, or rather a novel, could actually give me such strong emotional reactions over the stuff that happens in it. Everlasting Summer, on the other hand, fixed it.\n\nEverlasting Summer tells a story about a male, Semyon, who gets on a bus and falls asleep. Rather than waking up in the bus or the bus station he wakes up in a pioneer camp not knowing how he got there and why he is there. From this point the story takes a huge leap to more and more absurd things to happen.\n\nI'm not really a heavy reader. I don't read much. But for some reason Everlasting Summer kept me interested, kept me enetertained, kept me wanting to see more. There hasn't been a story that could make me lose my sleep just to see what's next. There hasn't been a story that actually made me focus on it without noticing my surroundings. There hasn't been a story that could actually get heavy emotions out of me.\n\nThe visuals, the writing, the soundtrack. Without these three key elements the story wouldn't have been so powerful. All these elements merged into a one epic and unforgettable experience I won't forget in a long time. Everything worked and behaved so well between each other creating even a physical feel at times. Now, I won't spoil anything about the game but there are parts, especially in your first playthrough, which will, or at least I hope, make you feel just like the characters in the story feel at the particular moment. It may be a little bit of cheating adding audio-visual elements in to a written story but because Everlasting Summer is such an absurd tale having you rush through different kinds of emotions you really need to have something to strenghten the emotions, in good and bad.\n\nNow for the part which is about the story or the theme of the game. Show the spoiler in order to view it. I won't spoil the actual plot but I will be explaining the basic elements in each storyline, which may or may not affect your first playthrough experiance.\n\nEverlasting summer isn't just your typical tale about going to a summer camp, or a pioneer camp in this case, finding a girl and getting it on with her. Oh no, not even close to being one! Or maybe I'm just praising this a little bit too much because the main storylines are about getting the girl you want which will affect the rest of your life. In a good way or a bad way depending on which enging you got. But that's what makes playing the main storylines interesting, getting a glimpse of the absurd happenings in the camp and after the camp, each time revealing something new about the story and Semyon's life.\n\nThe fun doesn't stop there though, quite the opposite actually. After unlocking all the good endings with all the girls in the camp and your own good ending you are now able to complete (???) and Harem ending, which will explain the plot furthermore. These endings will give you more answers. These ending will give out the plot and theme of the game. They construct the story all over again and make you think more deeply about the story rather than just seeing it as a dating simulator (although it's pretty obvious to see everything is not right in the camp. These endings just give you more answers, as I said above).\n\nNow for my own thought about the story and theme. Spoilers (again)!\n\nI'm not really 100% sure what the theme of the game was but the theme I got out of this game was finding yourself, knowing what means being you, what you personally think you need in your own life. The secret (???) ending will give you this idea pretty clearly. And the free DLC (which can be located from Options and scrolling down to Mods) will give you even more answers and supporting ideas over this theme. The game is about understanding your life, making lifetime decisions, deciding what makes you... YOU! A really pwerful motivational theme over a wonderfully attractive game visual and audio wise.\n\nAfter completing the main storylines you will be left with unanswered questions (which I talked about behind those spoilers) but there are a couple of more secret storylines to enlighten you about the whole story. As I said, it's more than just a dating simulator. It much more deeper than that. And the (???) ending, Harem ending and a free DLC ending, which can be located from the Options menu scrolling down to the bottom in the Mod section called 'Pioneer's Day', will give you all the answers you need regarding to the story. I strongly recommend playing the DLC after getting all the storyline achievements.\n\nAnd for all the perverts out there, yes, I tried out the Hentai-patch which, surprisingly, didn't ruin the game. It doesn't really add anything new to the table other than some boobs and a couple of sex scenes but if you truly are playing this game for the story you will not find the scenes sexually appealing in any way.\n\nEverlasting Summer was one of the very few Visual Novels I've played but I still could say Everlasting Summer will end up as one of my favourite games of all time for years to come. Maybe even to the day I die.","January 2","true","12.4"," 38 of 45 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","38","45","4","0"

My God, this game.\nEverlasting Summer is exactly what you would expect from a visual novel - a game that basically plays itself and let's you make a few (quite important) choices, depending on which your story progresses and eventually gets you to one of the 13 endings the game has to offer. Yep, 13. Quite impressive, right? If you're a fan of visual novels, what you've already read has probably got you hooked, but this game is something way more than just a visual novel.\nFirst of all, this game is free. No micro transactions, no expensive DLC that actually holds 50% of the story. Absolutely free. It's even available on mobile devices, again, for free.\nI'm not a huge fan of visual novels. I have barely even played any of the Telltale games, and I did approach Everlasting Summer with a bit of skepticism, considering the fact it was a FREE visual novel. But after just a couple of minutes in the game, I was hooked, I just could not get off, I could not stop playing. This game is an absolute masterpiece. Every dialogue, every scene, every possible outcome of the story is perfected. The story, in general, is amazing, It is original, fun, surprising and involves some beautiful plot twists at times. The atmosphere of the game is stunningly good, the music is always on point and so well made that it gave me the chills every other minute while playing the game and I still can't shake it off. I've been playing the game for 2 days and I've got 2 of the possible endings unlocked, but I look forward to getting each and every secret of that game unveiled, because it's definitely worth the time.\nThere is a reason this game is free - everyone should play it at some point of their life.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LelenasChild/recommended/331470/","LelenasChild","Ben is Zero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LelenasChild/","18 products in account","NOTE Just 9 minutes before I submitted this review, Steam forced all adult content to be removed. This is around 25 images. I am very sad. This irritates me. The complete version is not this, so this game is incomplete. Still highly reccomend, but flips sake.... Don't worry about missing actual content though I suppose, just that the screen is black ^_^\n\nOkay, so this review isn't really structured, nor is it perfect, and nor does it have a valid conclusion, but it does tell you how I feel about this amazing game, and how I'd recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat. It may contain slight spoilers, but nothing that will reveal anything to a new player, or spoil anything for a current player. I finished this game in a single weekend to 100% completion in 23.9 hours game time. I may never have completed this visual novel, had I not set myself a target to beat it in under 24 hours, in a single weekend, and I just about managed it at 4:50 am. The reason for perhaps not finishing is how much I felt it was all nonsense, and clutching at straws, but that was never the case, so I urge you to play it all. So I started off with Everlasting Summer because I was tired of losing in every other game I was playing. I was feeling down, and remebered how happy other visual novels have always made me feel in the past. I was a bit unsure to start it, as the art style didn't appeal to me to initially, and the music seemed boring. Oh I was very wrong. Sure, the pictures in the gallery are all drawn in different styles by different people, but that doesn't mean they are bad pieces. They each provide multiple views, and allow you to see each character more realistically, which is a nice touch. The music is amazing. Tracks like 410, Blow with the Fires, Mystery Girl, Forest Maiden, Orchid, Trespassing and Pile give a nice feel of both sadness, happiness and just awe, fitting in appropriately with whats happening in the story, and there are also comical tracks which often accompany our favourite little USSR shirted 14 year old. The characters grow upon you and everything is great.... untill you finish the first route after around 5-6 hours of playing, and are left shocked, disheartened, and almost definitly confused.\nChances are, you flunked it hard. (The point scoring method used in this game is difficult, and unless you're reasonably smart, or lucky, or both,) you'll end up with a Seymon end. Now this isn't at all bad, but a certain pioneer will tell you some things, that will make you sad about some of the girls, and care less about what happens. You'll be all confused, but intrigued and go on to play the game, in attempt to actually get somewhere. (You will, I promise.) I flunked again, and got the other Seymon end, and then on my 4th runthrough, I achieved my first girl route. This left me confused.... I had beaten the first challenge the game had to offer, I had reduced the contents of my scrotum, and yet nothing made much sense. THIS IS WHERE I THINK MANY PEOPLE GIVE UP. The girls routes seem to defy the rules set by the Seymon routes, and you are forced to believe that each route has it's own seperate laws, and that everything is just slightly linked. It's disappointing, and you'll have all sorts of questions like "Why am I never in this loop?" and "How did this girl get here with me?".... THIS IS WHERE I DEMAND YOU PRESS ON! The next 3 primary girls routes (Slavya, Lena, 'Miku' and Ulyana) should take you another while, especially with the difficulty of the point system, and you'll be left assuming that the story ends when the route ends, and you're just doing different things. (For players of 999: 9 persons, 9 hours, 9 doors, you may be able to appreciate that it all makes sense in the end.) Then everything goes back to front, because you've unlocked 'Miku's' route. 'Miku's' route will throw you into a crazed adventure, and then if you're a sane person, you'll be laughing and crying with what the heck is going on with this game. You might be tempted to take a break. Hopefully, you're tempted to finish the game. Because this is when the final two endings are open. The final two endings, are both plausable outcomes, and will not both exist, in my opinion, (With the ??? being the primary ending, but the harem being a fun alternative), but both endings will each give you different pieces of information. Once you link these in with what you are told in the initial Seymon routes, you'll have a brainwave, and hopefully will be glad you kept playing: Because everything does fit in! I promise!\n\nThe game provides:\nAmazing music\nAmazing visuals\nA solid story line, with few plot holes\nBrief, yet enjoyable sex scenes, which do not get in the way either\nFeelings of amazement\n\nThe game features:\nVodka\nAnime breasts\nZombies\nYanderes\nScience fiction\nHorror\n....And many other things you might not expect from the title.\n\nThe only flaws I can personally find are:\nGetting Semyon endings before girls, instead of before 'Miku'\nDifficulty of getting the route you want, for impatient story hunters\nNot that much sex?\nNude sprites aren't shown in the sprite menu ;-;\nNot the greatest for anyone who isn't male and into females - could be distracting.\n\nIt's enjoyable for every man who has the patience, and the time to unlock the secrets of the camp.\n\nP.s. If you want your boobs back....\nhttps://vk.com/topic-62816733_31120658 and go to\n\Steam\SteamApps\common\Everlasting Summer\game\nAnd put the file in there :3\n\nDLC!\nOkay, so there are currently two DLC's availible in English. The Alisa alternative ending, which is nice, and then a super mega awesome piece of DLC about a single pioneer, and not the pioneers collectively!\nBoth these DLC's are really amazing and should be played 100% for maximum enjoyment - treat them as part of the game, as like an epilogue!","November 24, 2014","true","29.8"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","32","37","0","0"

A lot of time.\n\nNow why did I bother to write a review this time, for this Free-To-Play (eroge?) game no less? Because the contents of this game totally (and very surprisingly) entertained and amused me for the past few hours I played it from start to finish without so much as a pause.\n\nNow, I don't play eroge games often. In fact, I never played one, until Everlasting Summer that is. I simply played this game because, well, it's free; but also because the other reviews heavily favours its storytelling over the visual aspect of the game. Curiosity got the better of me, so I thought, "Why not? First time for everything, right?" Well, I will tell you readers right now, that my past few hours playing this game was well spent. And so is the time fleshing out this review at the moment...\n\nIt isn't just the storytelling of this visual novel that is entertaining. The music is very good given that this is a Free-To-Play, and they really suit the atmosphere of the scenes. The only complaint I have about the music is that sometimes you get electric guitar solos playing durings scenes where the characters appear to be playing an acoustic guitar - totally immersion-breaking. But otherwise, for the majority of the game the music is awesome and very well laid out.\n\nWhat adds more to the atmosphere is the writing style. If you can turn a blind eye over some grammar/spelling mistakes (which there are very very few considering how much text this game contains), the descriptions of emotions, sceneries, thoughts and atmospheres etc are very detailed and beautiful. Perhaps when coupled with the background music or sound, you really start to feel lost in the story as you dive into it.\n\nPerhaps the only major complaints I have about this game is that it takes at least an hour or two (in your first playthrough) before you really start to get past the "introduction" of the story. During my first two hours, I came real close to stopping for a save and perhaps continue it, maybe 2 months later or something... Because of the slow-paced nature of the story, but also I was getting tired of the narrator describing every single emotion or feeling he feels for every piece of dialogue he is engaged with, whether he's speaking to or listening to someone. In that sense, there is a degree of repetition which can get annoying. I feel that if I get to make more choices rather than make a single choice every 10 minutes of reading, it would make things more interesting at least.\n\nHowever, if you managed to get past the initial 2 hours or so (depending on how fast a reader you are of course), you will find yourself making decisions that somehow make you wonder if they really make a difference... Which I can assure you that they do. I have only played through this once so far and I happened to get the "good neutral ending" because my decisions were based on what I would actually do if I were to be myself (i.e. I wasn't trying to be a bad Johnson flirting with every chick in the game). In fact, I was actually trying to hook myself up with a specific character but because I made a small blunder trying to get to know the other girls first, I ended up giving up the opportunities to learn more about the one girl I was going for... (And I didn't know the story only lasts for several ingame days rather than weeks...) So all in all, if you're aiming to date one of the girls, shoot for her at every opportunity you can get, because if you miss your chance, you may very well have to restart your game to win her heart.\n\nLong story short, this game is simple in design; perhaps at times too simple, but it mimicks certain aspects of real life (other than you seem to be the magnet of every girl in the game) in a sense that if you lose your opportunity, you might not recover from it at all. And at the same time, the storyline isn't hell-bent on chasing after skirts. Like I said, I ended up with the "good neutral" ending albeit unintentionally. And I won't spoil you, but even the good ending itself contains a plot twist...\n\nIn terms of replayability, I would say if you are a completionist or you like choice-based storytelling games, and definitely you aren't foreign to reading tons of texts, then you will certain feel at home with this one. However, give it at least one go if you don't mind the occasional cleavage or panty shot. As for me, I am definitely replaying this. (Not for the cleavage and panty shots, although those can be the icing on the cake, perhaps?) ;)","November 23, 2015","true","21.0"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","28","31","2","0"

It's a visual novel games made by Russian which imported Hatsune Miku herself personally to play a role! I never too fond of visual novel genre, as I try a lot of these games in the past - not able to finish even single one of it mostly because of boring writing. So with the free price tag, another thing that I found really confusing, I think it will not hurt to try this one, and turns out that it was a right choice.\n\nOne of the most "eye-catching" elements of this game is good visual. The background is very gorgeous and pretty, it's like watching a high budget of anime production, which unfortunately not followed by the looks of character's sprite. It's still good but being compared to the high quality art of those backgrounds can't help us to feel underwhelming work being put into the character art.\n\nThe story and writing is entertaining, but what really shining is the plot, it's just way ingenious and leap far many visual novel games with their boring theme. Many people will miss it because they just play in the first hours and only finish one or two girls arc - which is pretty standard. Writing about it will spoil everything, but I just want to say if you like twisted and mind blowing story I suggest you to press into the final secret arc.\n\nIf you play this VN for hentai you'll be more or less disappointed. This game has fan services, yes, but the quantity is very small and it's not that good, actually at some points it's bothering the good story they already made. One or two sexy times are nailed it, but the rests are forced and not believable, it kinda annoys me because with their writing capabilities I think they can come surpassing other cliche VNs in this area.\n\nThe ending and few plots can be quite tragic and gruesome, to the point of mental punishing! If you're lucky like me, you'll fall into the trap of that sweet girl and get the shocking WTH moment in the first try! xD\n\nEverlasting Summer is a very good option from a lot of boring visual novel games, shining with its very interesting writing, great visual, and ingenious plot with an added elements of tragedy which reward an insisting player who able to push into the 'true' final section of the game with the mind revealing from a twisted and complicated question rises in the game itself.\n\nNOTE: Check the workshop section for an additional contents such as alternative arcs.\n","December 24, 2014","true","15.9"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","26","32","2","0"

I was born and raised here. My parents are though russian and we went to Moscow pretty much every summer and even sometimes on other holidays too.

Really nice ones. I've not been to Russia for 2 years now. Probably should. A pity though, Im 18 and that I am too old for kid camps now. the line goes at about those 17 years..

I seen all but the last 3 endings.  I like to do a review after I am 100% done with the "game" (and yes I called it a game but its 95% visual novel and 5% game) with 13 diffrent ending and I have seen 10 of them, this is so worth any one time nearly for a week this is all I have been reading(I have only had it for about a week I think).  The story just kind of draws you in right from the start, like any good book or movie it gets you up to speed with who the main character is and the story just take you a way always making you want to find out more.\n\nThis will make you laugh, it will make you cry, it will make you think back to your youth (I say that it might really take you back if your in your late 20's to late 30's) It reminded me of what it was like as a teenager.  This story was written really well, after reading almost every thing in this, im going to be kind of sad when theres no more to read.  There are a few images that are blocked from this Steam version, (even though I unlocked them from the creators) it takes away almost nothing more than a description of what was on the screen for no more than like 15 sec, and it has no impact on the story at all really.  But its written so well that even if they had only just the images of the characters, it will still work.  The fact that this is free, really shocks me on how well it looks and written as well as the music.\n\nThe music is spot on and it done so well that it up there with the best of the Final Fantasy's music.  It fits so well that it just adds that extra kick to make this game great.  Give every one who made this novle alot of credit, the fact that they translated from Russen to English (it was really good translation, a few things here and there, but nothing noticable) They even have pop ups that let you know what some thing mean, they thought a head and knew that alot of people did not grow up in Russa, and they tell you ehat some things mean, and thats some thing I have never seen done before.\n\nMy Final thoughts is, download it.  Its well worth your time, the fact that its free is in my mind almost criminal the fact thats its free for what your getting.  It proves that 'Free' can be really good if some one is committed to making some thing good weather it be book, game, or movies.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/denteddementia/recommended/331470/","denteddementia","Ymri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/denteddementia/","317 products in account","Everlasting Summer is one of the more unusual romantic visual novels I've play, with a surprisingly deep and immersive plot and enjoyable characters. There are a number of flaws, but most of them are superficial and don't diminish the enjoyability of the game to any significant extreme.\n\nThe Plot:\nThe plot is fantastic. For a casual romantic-visual novel player, the surface layer of the game should more than be enjoyable, with four major romantic routes and definitive happy endings. However, as you delve farther into the story of Sovionok and Everlasting Summer, the plot starts twisting and reveals rather bizarre undertones. There are three additional paths beyond the four basic love interests, one of which is only reachable having traversed the other six and getting fully immersed into the story. This final path ties the story together and really draws the game to a satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe Main Character:\nSemyon, the protagonist, is honestly one of the worst elements of this game. For introverts and shut-ins, he is first portrayed as a very relatable character, and is subject to getting drawn into this bizarre world by chance. However, it doesn't take long before you're likely pulling out your hair at how idiotic he regularly is. He regularly gets lost on strange mental tangents and runs circles repeatedly over subjects that should easily be dropped. While he fortunately realizes the emotions of his female counterparts faster than your average anime protagonist, he tends to get infuriatingly confused with his own emotions. However, this is probably the only major gripe I have with this game.\n\nThe Rest of the Cast:\nEach character is their own unique and special snowflake, resulting in a small but colorful cast. Some of the characters come off as rather two dimensional, but this is typically subverted as the story progresses. All of your favorite romance tropes are in full effect here - the tsundere, the vanilla sweetheart, the wallflower - fortunately, again, they aren't typically confined to their roles. Probably one of the stronger points of the game would be character development and interactions; admittedly it would be a poor visual novel otherwise.\n\nThe Art:\nThe art can be... peculiar. A lot of it is recycled and reused, to mixed effect. In addition, the artist's seemed to be incapable of agreeing on certain details, most notably Olga's color scheme. However for the most part the art is of acceptable quality and is at it's best at the most important times, namely the endings and emotional high points.\n\nThe Music:\nNot much to note here. I don't see myself downloading an OST or coming back to listen to it specifically, but the music is of good enough quality and certainly most excellently used.\n\nThe Replay:\nThis game has a high, almost mandatory replay value. There are up to seven individual paths you can go down, with all but one having two endings. As previously mentioned, the final path can only be unlocked after you have completed all other paths. As far as replaying through the game goes, you will be appreciative of the fast-forward button. Many events are fully or heavily independant of which route you're going down, and being given a tour of the camp thirteen seperate times is not something I want to sit through in full.\n\nThe Notes:\nThree final points come to mind. Firstmost: yes, this game was originally written in Russian. While the translation is commendable, the spelling isn't perfect and the grammar sometimes bears tinges of a speaker who knows English as a second language. Unless you are an insufferable grammar Nazi, this should be mildly distracting at it's worst. Secondly: If you are looking for a specific ending (which is likely), I would advise looking up a guide. Many, if not most, endings are near-impossible to get without knowing exactly which decisions to make. For example, the four main character's good or bad endings are decided on a points-based system: at least six points will put you on that character's path, and at least nine points will net you the good end. Alisa has exactly nine points total. In addition, Miku's path is only acchievable after certain conditions are met and you must make the exact right decisions to trigger it. Not a huge detriment, just a warning. Finally, this game was originally advertised as an adult-rated game, but as of a patch a few days ago as-of me writing this, the adult content has been removed. This doesn't really harm the story much, but it's also not particularly difficult to mod the adult content back in. Take it as you will.\n\nIn conclusion, this game has it's faults, but it is definitely one of the better visual novels available, and I highly recommend playing it. It's free, what do you have to lose? Time? If you've gotten this far through my review, you obviously have free time. Go play it.","November 26, 2014","true","19.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

I was really pleased with the ending and couldn't believe I picked this up for FREE. It's one of the better visual novels in the free category. Although Anime with this fluff (Fan Service) definitely isn't my bag the story was enough to keep me reading!\n\nIt's FREE! If you play this one make sure to finish! You won't be disappointed.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful? Either way join this group for more.

Everlasting Summer was recently translated to English and in my opinion is very overlooked and underrated, more people definitely need to find this amazing gem of a visual novel.\n\nThis was my first time playing a visual novel and i probably won't ever forget it, the Story is absolutely amazing and very interesting at that with a total of 13 endings and different choices and routes to take (i highly recommend getting all endings to get the whole story of the game). You can easily find spoiler free Guides or Walkthroughs on how to get certain endings if you want, which is what i ended up doing. You can automatically fast forward through all the scenes which you've already seen and the game will automatically stop when it reaches words or scenes you haven't read or seen.\n\nThe music in Everlasting Summer is fantastic and probably one of the best parts of the game, trust me, it will get stuck in your head for a while.\n\nThe art was overall pretty good, although certain scenes were drawn and had slight quirks, it can be easily overlooked and actually adds a certain charm to it and you get used to it, the background CGs more than make up for it.\n\nOn average the game should take about 15-20 hours to get all endings and the game is free + it also has free DLC! The game is about 800 MB and is definitely worth installing and trying out.\n\nSteam however has the game censored, but you can go to the official website of Everlasting Summer here[everlastingsummer.su] and get a simple drag & drop patch to restore the censored scenes if you wish.\n\nTL;DR Amazing free visual novel with lots of endings, fantastic music, great CGs and an amazing story.

It's not that bad, but characters can totally end up differently in one or two scenes.\nMaybe Semyon, our protagonist is a little more awkward than he should and monologises too much sometimes.\nBut none of these "cons" take away from this beautiful game!\n\nIt is the story that you want to happen to you, but sadly, it never will.

You woke up inside a russian Icarus bus (410) Outside A pioneer camp Sovenok (Owlet) in summertime, Date and place unkown. This Camp will change your life; pretty girls and strange adventures are awaiting for you, and its rumored this adventure never ends, its both hell and heaven.\n\n\nReview\nIts impressing on how much content and script this Visual Novel contains, Amazingly drawn scenery and mood shifting background music. Well written plot, although It's very difficult to make common sense in the Beggining, but Other friends promised me that you will slowly begin to understand.\n\nGame includes 13 endings, good, bad, and absolutely twisted ones. Specific the Miku ending.\nYou sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nI'm still unable to understand if The Sovenok Camp is either an imagination or reality, from the point of view, your main character just enters the bus and falls asleep, wakes up in this camp questioning his existance, if its just a dream or a reality. Which I aswell tried to understand what on earth is going on. In the most common ending (Simon's route) it adds a touch of fantasy, bring unexplainable phenomena twisting the plot and yet confusing myself. I soon hope this game will explain everything in detail on whats going on Because I really have a hard time to find out.\n\nThankfully its not one of those "use your imagination visual novels" which storyline relies on your fantasy, thank you otherwise I would just totaly hate the game. I frankly almost hated the game when I tried to make sense of it and it Didn't explain almost anything. It only leaves few clues which doesn't really encourage the player to replay the game. It doesn't hint hidden secrets on the most common ending you get as first timer.\n\nPlus what's missing on this game is the options you could have. But I realised it doesn't really matter because the few options you have already are pretty much enough to alter the story direction.\n\nThe developers recently removed the Sex Scenes (a touch of hentai) My opinion on this is that they actually done the correct thing\n\nThe Verdict\nPros\n+Well written plot, Draws your interest.\n+Includes 13 Rich content Endings\n+Character&Enviroment design, SFX and BGM totaly changing the atmosphere of the game depends the location\n+Two Languages\n+Able to mod the game\n\nCons-Discourages the player to Replay the game\n-Action scene artwork is extremely lazy.

Two of the games were completed in less than 10 minutes each, and a third in about 20. Good games, just short. The fourth I got bored of after about a half an hour, and decided I would try out this one. I didn't think this game would be anything special, I've never been one who watches anime or reads visual novels, but the game was free and the reviews were positive (But mostly it was free). One of the most unique things right off the bat about this game is that while it looks like your typical Japanese visual novel, it is actually Russian, explaining why the game was developed by a company called Soviet Games.\n\nSo I start up the game, thinking that it will probably be weird, funny, and at least a little entertaining. Five hours later I had completed the game for the first time, getting (In my opinion) a terrible ending after becoming so attached to this story. I thought to myself, "Wow, I actually really ♥♥♥♥ing enjoyed that game. The characters were endearing, the story just weird enough mixed with normal, and I grew attached to the experience. I felt such strong emotions during that, more than a lot of other games or stories. It's a shame that I didn't like this ending." But then I remembered that there were ELEVEN OTHER ENDINGS that I could get. Wondering what on earth I could have done to get those other endings, I played through the game again (There is an awesome feature by the way that allows you to skip text you've already seen, and stops skipping when you reach a choice or text you have not previously seen) for a few more hours just to get another ending, and grew even more attached to the game and it's characters. That's right, even with the fast forwarding through text, each individual ending has hours of additional text and story. That's when I decided that I was going to get all of the endings.\n\nAll in all, it's a quirky, excellent game where choice actually matters a lot, with tons of hours of content and replayability. The translation to english is sometimes rather rough, but I felt that it didn't hinder the story-telling at all. The setting of the game and it's background are extremely interesting, especially if you are not Russian. Be warned, however, as there is some mature content in this game, of which the graphics aren't available in the normal Steam download, so if you would like some uncensored stuff it's quick and easy to download on the Everlasting Summer website. Anyways, to wrap up, this game is unironically one of my favorite games so far this year, and would reccommend it to most people. Besides, it's free, so if you don't like it, what's the harm?","January 30, 2015","true","25.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

The writing is rough but its charm will win you over before you even realize it. So, so many different endings each satisfying and worth pursuing. I also like the overall story here, it's a bit of a deconstruction of the typical Visual Novel. We see our protagonist in a bad state (Yes, a typical anime shut-in) but believe me you begin rooting for our character (and its worth noting that in all my experiences with novels there's only been a few times where I agreed completely with every action of the hero- and this is one of them. In other words its no Sakura Spirit haha). But by the end there is a serious change that's honestly inspiring.\n\nFor a free, a FREE ♥♥♥♥ing game, I was completely blown away by the quality. Now, don't set your expectations too high. A large factor of my enjoyment of this game is because I went in with rock bottom expectations but if you're looking for a review to just win you over enough- play it. It has a lot of heavy russian culture and names, the pacing is rough, I can see a few endings being completely horrendous for a first playthrough (i.e. Lela bad end and any of the non-girl endings). And I'd say if the charm of nostalgia, summer camps, cute girls, and living life to the fullest doesn't win you over you might have some problems with the rough writing as well- it's not bad at all but there were one or two moments.\n\nOverall, for having rock bottom expectations: I was completely blown away. But if you read this then it's an above average visual novel with a very inspiring dynamic main character, several endings that range from sweet- to brutal- to loving- to sci fi wonders, and a certain charm that drew me in completely. So without my rock bottom expectations being blown away I'd honestly give it a high recommendation (very high for fans of VN's)- I don't do that score ♥♥♥♥\n\n(As of this time I have 7 hours and can see myself clocking in 10 hours at 100% completetion to those worried about length. The normal campaign with one ending will take 5-6 hours)","March 21, 2015","true","7.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

This one is definitely going on my personal favorites list. Gameplay-wise it's good, nothing too bad but also nothing too spectecular. Story-wise however that's a whole another thing. Each of the 13 stories start off slow but develop into an incredible and emotional story. I would even dare to say that story-wise this game is up there a long with the bioshock-series and telltale games like TWD en TWAU.\n\nSlightly spoiler but:\n1st - the Miku-route/ending is absolutely mind blowing. It's a legit 2 hour horror movie (horror movie junkies will understand what I mean)\n\n2nd - you should definitely try to get the Yulia-route/ending, it will explain the whole story and will leave you with a satisfied feeling (this route is also a 2 hour special, just as the Miku-route/ending)\n(best played as very last storyline after you've done all the other storylines)\n\n3rd - make sure that you save before making the choice of going further or going back in the Yulia-route/ending, because you gonna want to play the harem-ending right after the Yulia-ending for further explanation of the game and this story\n\n4th - if you're a completionist like me and want to get the whole photoalbum completed, make sure to save before you make a decision with who you want to wake up with during the Yulia-route/ending\n\n\nI would conclude with saying that I would like to thank the creators of this game for giving me and the fellow gamers who downloaded this game such an incredible experience. The fact that it's free to play suprises me because I would be happily paying 10-20 bucks for this game, considering the amount of gameplay and story we get.\n\nVerdict 10/10","November 26, 2014","true","16.3"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","0"

I am new to this genre, however I find the multiple choice branches to several alternate story lines and  interesting endings make it a cut above most VN's.  It has existentialist aspects, bringing to my mind Luigi Pirandello's {1934 Nobel Laureate} play “Six Characters in Search of an Author”.\n\nThe “hidden” stories and screens in the alternate story lines add a lot to the enjoyment of the game.  I have found the game to be quite interesting and, as a ”Free To Play”, it's hard to beat the price.\n\nAs the protagonist, you are a 21st Century middle-age man drawn into a strangely inter-time-dimensional mystery as a generally mediocre {fill in choice for field of endeavor; guitarist, scholar, programmer, on-line consultant, interpersonal relations, etc.} failure.  After boarding a bus during a snowy Winter evening in a large Russian city, you fall asleep and awaken to find yourself in an abandoned bus at the gate to some sort of camp bearing the name “Sovyonok”.  And there's a slight catch; it's a bright Summer day and you still are wearing your winter attire and heavy boots!\n\nThere you are met by a pretty young girl who apparently thinks there's nothing strange about you?!  You learn that this is a late Soviet era Pioneer Camp for youths at some indeterminate remote location.  The beautiful young Camp Director has been expecting you and, due to lack of space, she's your roomie!  But that is not enough “strange”.  Before long you have a chance to look in a mirror and see a teenager!!  And so it goes.\n\nWHAT is going on?  Can you figure out how this happened and get back to your “present”?  Do you WANT to get back or should you try to stay here?\n\nDuring my first pass through this VN, I found the story to be interesting but could not figure out how to direct the story line to a desirable ending.  Result?  Protagonist “Bad Ending”!  There are many {have not counted} choices which may provide potential turning points.  There are at least 5 potential love Interests and a missing fellow Pioneer {I almost typed “prisoner”}.\n\nIn bewilderment, I turned to the Community Guides for, what else, guidance.  While, with a large number of attempts, I might eventually have been able to figure them out, the guides are saving what probably would have been months of effort.  The reward has been significantly differing sets of story lines as the {now} young man explores relationships with the girls of Sovyonok. Will there be happy times or more failures and disappointments for the protagonist?\n\nMusic:  Usually when I play a game, the BGM is turned down to a bare minimum so it won't disturb me.  As I played Everlasting Summer, I kept finding myself turning the sound level up so I could enjoy the MUSIC.  The Music selections are very well done.  The BGM changes with the scenes and the characters.  It serves to enhance the mood appropriately as one progresses through this excellent VN.  I particularly liked the guitar riffs. I had to turn BGM up to maximum for those.\n\nEverlasting Summer presents extras including Background screens, Character screens, Sprite screens and a long list of Music selections.  There are about 100 Save slots.

I have a lot in my mind about what to write, but I decide to make a simple review (at least in my opinion).\n\nSo, about Everlasting Summer..\n\n- It's a dating sim, and it's free to play (Don't even hesitate, trust me)\n\n- Russian + Anime = Great combination, I don't even have to mention how the girls look.\n\n- Gallery full with pictures in-game and also music to unlock, so not only you have interesting story to read, but also another purpose to stay in the game.\n\n- Various endings, connected to Steam achievement, another purpose to stick longer in the game, at least for the people who love to collect it.\n\n- Interesting storyline. Sometime it's confusing, but it also have some unexpected twist, which at first I didn't expect it in this game. Brilliant work from the writer. It's like "Interstellar" with bewbs :D\n\n- Save/Load feature. So you can save when you find some difficult choices (you are more likely to come back and choose every, if not, most choices though, if you willing to get every ending and the achievement)\n\n8,5/10\n\nI have to warn you though, this game is rated 18 for obvious reason. Although Steam made it not that obvious. You can restore the missing parts, if you know where to look.\n\nAnother thing, you might want to look for walkthrough before reading, that if you want to see everything in the game but don't want to waste a lot of time. After all, it's just a VN, and it's not really a game.","January 27, 2015","true","4.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Rarely have I ever come across a piece of media that has had such an emotional impact on me in quite this unique a fashion. Sure, the usual check-marks of the average VN standard are here; Somewhat bland protagonist (initially), fairly black and white choices, and fanservice rewards for reaching certain endings (see the XXX patch of the game's original version for more details) just to name a few. However, Soviet Games turned the standard on its ear when developing this project in ways I never even imagined.\n\nAfter my first blind playthrough, I received a bad ending. However, it wasn't bad in a fashion I'd come to expect from other VN of the same dating sim nature. This stems from the fact that, while most games with a similar idea might try to focus purely on the realtionships the characters build, Everlasting Summer chooses to turn every encounter, good or bad, into a type of growth (or degeneration in a few cases...) for Symeon, the main character. From the start Symeon is shown to be a blank slate, much like any other sim protagonist. However, it quickly becomes clear that that isn't the full extent of his character. Symeon has a definite personality with multiple established traits. He's a shut-in with multiple, unspoken issues who has always opted to stay locked away in his room and communicate with the outside world through a computer screen, talking to people that, for all intense and purposes, aren't really there. As such, when he finds himself swept away to a summer pioneer camp after falling asleep on a bus in the middle of winter with no rhyme or reason, he must find a way to cope with a situation he has no experience with, spending his time forcibly getting to know people, looking for answers, and finding out things not just about the people and setting around him, but also about himself.\n\nKeeping this in mind, the first ending I got wasn't a punishment, but instead a learning experience, showing me that not every bad situation necessarily has to have a bad outcome. In the end, it all comes down to what we do after the situation passes that decides our futures. As such, I was encouraged to immediately play through the game again and get the good ending of the romantic partner I'd initially chose, and while the main idea of the ending wasn't massively different, I did feel like the second play through was worth my time for what the good ending added to the experience. slight touches and differences are what really make the choices in this game carry decent emotional weight. What's more, once you finish both playthroughs of one character, you'll be hooked and dying to figure out what happens to Symeon in the other situations you passed over. Out of all the Visual Novels and choice dependent games I've played, this was one of the only ones that felt as if it demanded me to get every single outcome and ending possible. What's more, each individual ending helps you understand a little something more about either Symeon or the Sovionok Pioneer Camp, meaning you'll have an even bigger reason to keep coming back to help piece together each individual story-line into one massive story-web.\n\nI want to say so much more about this game, but I'm afraid I might spoil some crucial plot points if I keep going, so I'll leave the rest to you, the player.\n\nIn short, this is a game that refuses to be a game. The main character is his own character, not just a suit for the player to wear and experience a simulated feeling of personal choice through. You will care about Symeon the more you play, and you will be drawn to see where each road takes him. On top of all of that, this game has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard in my storied history with video games, ranging from soft and classic rock to fully orchestrated pieces and techno-bit tracks, and I could honestly recommend it, even without all the other positives I've already mentioned, just for its musical score alone. Go download this game. Right now. It's free, and minus some personal preference on certain endings (we all have them) and some minor grammatical errors in the English dialog (it's a Russian Game Studio, so cut them some slack), there is no reason for anyone not to play through this wonderful game... no, this wonderful experience.","January 1, 2015","true","18.4"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Caevus/recommended/331470/","Caevus","Caevus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Caevus/","48 products in account","To preface my review, I must say that Everlasting Summer is a visual novel style of game. Expecting to control a character in the traditional way is misguided, because that is not how the game is played. A visual novel is just that, a novel that tells a story through narration (traditionally, and as is in Everlasting Summer, through text) and a simple use of pictures and character images. If you prefer your games to get right into the "action" with little introduction, narration, or verbal/textual description of the events transpiring, then this game is not for you. If you are, however, a fan of games that revolve around story told to you, or are just a fan of books and stories in general, then this might be something to check out.\n\nWhen I saw Everlasting Summer as a free game on steam, naturally, I was intrigued. I had never really tried the visual novel style of game, but as an avid reader I figured that I could find maybe the same kind of enjoyment that I would find in reading anecdotes with pictures. I was wrong, in a very good way.\n\nWhat Everlasting does very well is tell its story utilizing a wide range of emotions. At first, I wasn't sure about how connected I was going to get to the characters, but with the first introduction to the Pioneer Camp Sovionok I was soon attached to the main character that the story revolves around, Semyon. Everlasting Summer setup Semyon's life in a very relatable, realistic way, and throughout the story there is a feeling of development in Semyon, some realization of an awakening.\n\nThe other characters of Sovionok are also very interesting and well written. The story and game revolves around Semyon making decisions that impacts his relationship with some of the girls around the camp, eventually leading to his desire to want to remain with them in a romantic relationship, a very different situation to when he arrived. While the game does still contain nudity (to some degree, though if that IS your thing, there's a very simple way to reactive it fully) and sex, it isn't a leading theme, but a result of choices (though sometimes it can be over apparent). The characters grew on me, and by each ending I too, like Semyon, was hoping that they could remain together.\n\nCombining the superb storytelling full of emotion with the fact that the game contains Steam Workshop support (a VERY unexpected, but highly welcomed addition) that allows users, and even the developers, to release changes, additions, or entirely new stories built around Everlasting Summer and its style of game.\n\nThere are some places that Everlasting Summer falls short, however. The translations from Russian to English can be poor at times, and I saw a fair share of spelling and grammar errors in the English version. There is also a sense that maybe some points in the game have been skewed in translation, but I do not speak nor read Russian, so I cannot be for sure. Some things about Semyon's thought process and logic seem far fetched or cheaty at times, though this does not happen often.\n\nAll in all, Everlasting Summer does what it's meant to well: tells a story in a very emotion rich, beautiful way. The characters are full of personality and can really hit hard at home with events that occur. Everlasting Summer had me smiling, angry (in a good way), overjoyed, and even in saddening tears. If you enjoy storytelling and maybe don't mind the few sexual things, then I would highly recommend Everlasting Summer, even if you (like me) haven't tried the medium of Visual Novels before.\n\ntl;dr:\n\nPROS\n\nVery rich storytelling.\n\nEmotion filled (both in the story and for those partaking).\n\nRelatable and deep characters.\n\nSteam Workshop mod support.\n\nCONS\n\nMany spelling and grammar errors in the english translation.\n\nSometimes a sense of being "lost in translation".\n\nA few 'illogical', out of control deicisions.\n\nSometimes a little bit too much sexualization.","December 26, 2014","true","18.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

Granted, I did notice a ton of translation errors as wel as typos, but that didnt stop me any from enjoying the storyline either way. Now allow me to explain why in this handy list.\n\n1: Main character\n\nThe protagonist, Semyon, Is kind of relatable in a way to many people. He starts the story off as some average joe without any distinct characteristics. However, each time you play (and replay), you find that he adapts based on the events that happen to him in each playthrough. And, trust me, if you truly wish to get a full understanding of who Semyon truly is and what his role is in this tale, you'll play it more than once.\n\n2: Other Characters\n\nNo tale can be made with just one character (at least none that I've payed attention to). Thankfully, Soviet Games added characters who were not only engaging but quirky (different to each other, if you will). You have Slavya, the kindhearted epitome of the ideal pioneer, Lena, the quiet but mysterious girl who may be hiding more than she lets on, Alisa, the hardcore vixen with a softcore heart, Miku, the talkative Russian/Japanese, and Ulyana, the "little sister" who always ends up causing mayhem somehow.\n\nAnd let's not forget about side characters who dive the story further. Characters ranging from Olga Dmitrievna, the often strict but sometimes fair camp leader, to the mysterious Pioneer who always seems to pop in and out from time to time.\n\n3: Storyline.\n\nSoviet Games outdid themselves when they wrote the storylines for this game. Not only did the center the game entirely around the choices you made but it also allowed for very compelling reading. Each branch of the story can send the reader into a wave of emotions any any moment. One minute you're laughing at the antics of one of the pioneers, the next moment could send you into a wave of sorrow at how things turned out. Whether it be comedy or romance, Everlasting Summer is bound to keep you coming back.\n\n4: Soundtrack.\n\nNo video game is complete without a soundtrack. Thankfully, Sergey Eybog and the band, Between August and December, spare no expense when it comes to making a great sountrack. Ecah song, coupled with the visuals of the game and the captivating storyline, can send you into a feeling of nostalgia (at least that's what I felt, having gone to summer camps in my childhood).\n\n\n\n\nSo all in all here's the gist of it:\n\n\n\nPROS:\nCompelling read with branching storyline\nRelatable characters each with their own personalities\nSoundtrack that fits in with every scene\nCONS:\nReplaying certain aspects of the storyline tends to get repetitive\nThe choppy translation from the original Russian game may make things difficult to understand unless to improvise certain lines\nLack of adult content from its Russian predicessor (When will Steam stop with the dang censoring and just use parental conrols?)\nWith that said I would give it a perfect 10 if it were not for the last two cons. But I definitely give it 9/10.","November 30, 2014","true","152.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/recommended/331470/","SilvaOfWind","Silva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SilvaOfWind/","338 products in account","Based on the lack of price tag and inconsistent art style, you may be tempted to pass up Everlasting Summer out of hand. Don't. While there are certainly aspects of this visual novel you could take issue with or just plain dislike, Everlasting Summer is an obvious labor of love on the part of the developers, one that for the most part paid off.\n\n\nThe story opens with a day in the life of Semyeon, a Russian man who seems to be in his late twenties or perhaps early thirties. Semyeon doesn't do much with his life. In fact, he's the Russian equivalent of the Japanese Hikkikomori: he leaves his apartment solely for the sake of things like buying food before returning to his computer to ♥♥♥♥ around on Russian imageboards. Only one thing separates his life from an ordinary, if reclusive, existence: Semyeon has a recurring dream of life at a form of summer camp that has not existed since the fall of the USSR, designed to make "ideal citizens" of its campers.\n\n\nThat is the surreal premise of Everlasting Summer: Semyeon living in a time and place that seems entirely real, with no idea how or why he got there or if it is even possible to leave. If you're expecting a full-on psychological horror premise, don't. While there are unsettling elements to the whole thing and Semyeon never stops being concerned about the fantastic nature of his situation, the focus is mostly on romance. In the dream world, Semyeon is physically but not mentally his 17-year old self. Through interacting with the (mostly female) other campers, Semyeon grows as a person from his initially aimless self in a way that depends on the individual route.\n\n\nGiven the premise, it would be easy to fall back on simple character archetypes that are a dime a dozen in visual novels and dating sims. To its credit, Everlasting Summer never does that. While initially you might expect every character to be a simple, unaltered form of the archetype they initially appear to be... That would be incorrect, to say the least. Every one of the girls has a decent amount of depth, and none are entirely what they present themselves as.\n\n\nThe only real faults of Everlasting Summer are highly subjective. If you wanted the horror you might initially expect from the premise, that is fairly limited outside of a few routes designed around it. If you are simply uninterested in visual novels with dating sim tendencies, Everlasting Summer isn't likely to change your mind. If you expect entirely professional and consistent artwork, you won't find that here. If you expect to get through all the routes and endings without occasionally looking at a guide, good luck with that.\n\n\nYet despite or because of its flaws, I truly loved my time with Everlasting Summer and felt compelled to go through as many routes and endings as I could manage. What this visual novel occasionally lacks in proffesionalism given its amateur development team it more that makes up for in heart. Give it a shot.","March 7, 2015","true","17.5"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

I can finally review this game with honesty. The story is freakin fantastic, mind blowing and heart thumping. The graphics are beautiful as well, nicely drawn pics and the opening cinematic was well done. There are alot of typos especially near the end of the game, might wanna fix that. Two of the endings brought tears to my eyes, including the "final one" as i call it. The music is well thought out and starts up at the right moments. The replayability is pretty high and mandatory to find out the truth. You can't just play once and expect to know what's going on, i tried it and found out i was completely wrong after the final path. Now, there are likely much better VN's out there, but since i'm new to them, this is my favorite one so far.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hip_Albatross/recommended/331470/","Hip_Albatross","Drill Remover","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hip_Albatross/","72 products in account","Following in the Russian literary tradition of existentialist works, Everlasting Summer is a multi-faceted triumph of art and entertainment.  Originating from IIchan, Everlasting Summer manages to avoid inauthenticity and pretentiousness that is inherent in image board culture to deliver a visual novel that is truly heartfelt and contains a tone and spirit unlike any other VN currently released.  The plot and themes of the game are relatable to anybody, regardless of age or ethnic background, even if one’s experience is the mirror image or exact opposite of the events within the game.  In a genius move, the division of two realities allows anybody to experience the VN while also engaging in a perspective that differs from their own.  Both existential dramedy and meta commentary on life and entertainment in the post-internet age, Everlasting Summer avoids the cynicism and post-post-post-modern irony found in similar releases of its kind.  While it lacks the biting and irreverent satire of a certain Krautchan VN, it more than eclipses the former with beautiful visuals, an effective multi-genre soundtrack and a genuine sincerity that, combined with the tantalizingly gripping writing style, coalesces into an unforgettable experience that unequivocally stands as the best visual novel released in years.  A flawless English translation means that this hidden gem can be experienced by many, many more people.  Play this as soon as you can; time is precious, as Everlasting Summer eventually makes very clear, and you will certainly not waste or regret any time spent with this.","August 24, 2015","true","32.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Even it has its "negative sides" (I don't even know if you can call them so) IT'S FREE! Im very grateful, that I could play it for free.\nSo let's go ahead.\nWhat I love about this game?\nIt's weird because its kinda an eroge game (indeed it is lol) but I didn't rly care tbh because I just wanted to play a good visual novel with or without romantic sides. Who think it's just a 0815 dating-simulator, well.. It's not. It's something more than that.\nThe delevopers put a lot of effort and love in this game, I don't even know. The MOST stunning thing for me was truly the backgrounds of this game... you can just lean back and enjoy them.\nOverall the arts were great, sure details of the characters changed from time to time (for instance: Alisa's hair colour changing from brown to blond etc.) and many CG's were nearly the same except the characters.\nBut still: every route had its details and another outcome. That was quite a "experience" for me.\nI thought a lot about this game. To understand the characters, why they do that and so on.\nWhat this game really is about. How important are the decisions I do in my life?\nMoreover, I rly liked and enjoyed every character.  Sometimes they pretty creeped me the f**k out with these creepy smiles but it was pretty refreshing with a bit of horror taste.\nThere is lots to do: many decisions, many routes, good and bad endings + some extra content to dive deeper in the story. I did every route except the bad endings. For me they were all worth it the time and you should really take some time to think about this game and enjoy it of course.\nJust wtf was up with that Miku/Masha route like seriously XD I loved the Ulyana zombies tho haha\nBTW I loved the humor! Yeah maybe not everyone watches anime or reads manga.. but there were several references. Just take one moment for a closer look :P Don't worry it's not full of them, the comments from our protagonist are pretty funny too.\n\nWhat sometimes a little annoyed me were the sudden russian translations.. but mistakes like that can happen a lot in a game. Sure I couldn't understand some sentences but Im fine with it.\n\nWhatever..  IT'S FREE GOD DAMN!\nWell why are you still reading this? Just play it already! I recommend it completly :)\nI hope I didn't say too much, enjoy the game and I hope I could help you.","April 3","true","22.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

The art in the hentai patch is of lower quality than the art in the game in general, so I don't recommend it -- it's the equivalent of five or six frames of mediocre fanart.\n\nMy one problem with this game is the quality of the character art. It's definitely superior to the art in a lot of free-to-play or cheap VNs, and is at about the same level as some older professional VNs like Fate/Stay Night; however, it doesn't hold up to current standards.\n\nWhile the setting is a soviet summer camp, no knowledge about soviet culture is strictly necessary.","December 20, 2015","true","30.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","5","5","2","0"

So take that in consideration when reading my review :)\n\nOnly recommended if - If you like visual novels and a LOT of reading (depending on which first route, one clear can take 6-8 hours maybe)\n- If you don't mind a visual novel which has different stylearts. One styleart for backgrounds, one for for people in the scenes and one for "epic scenes".\n- If you don´t mind something soviet related (not that there is any propaganda or anything, the soviet pioneere camp aspect could have been shifted with nearly any other kind of normal summercamp)\n- If you don't mind quite a challenge to get all the endings (or don't mind using a guide to get some of the hard once)\n\nAll the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things- The game is without any doubt so well made, damn beautiful backgrounds! so many details, so many hidden things, but mostly the technical part is awesome! They have made it quite easy to skip text while you don't have to be afraid of missing any new text, new scenes (unless you set it in options to skip all) this makes so much easier to get all the endings without getting tired. Also so many saveslots, you can scroll back if you want to reread something or had pick the wrong choice, and there is a lovely gallery for collection of pictures, background and music for you to collect ingame.\n- The story seems very like a classic harem cliché story but luckily it isn't! it is much more than that :) Much unknowness to explore(you have to clear all the endings to be able to understand the story)! And I did like the two endings which you might call the true endings (??? ending and haram ending. Those two wrap it all up!)\n- Even though there is some ecchi/hentai in it, if you patch the game. The ecchi/hentai part doesn't overrule or ruin the story, it only adds a smaller aspect to the story.\n- SO MANY CHOICES! So many endings!!!!! I can´t praise this highly enough!\n- Very lovely music :3\n- Lots of hidden of somewhat metatext to other endings, so pay attention! you might slip some quite good details. :P\n-  d´uh, it is free!!\n\nAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons - some of the "epic scens" are quite badly drawn, I personally don't mind the different style from the normal scenes, but a few of them weren´t good at all!\n- One does not simply get all the endings unless using very much time or help from guides (I myself got tired of keep trying to get some endings which I could not figure out, but others might find it good, a challenge indeed! :) )\n- Some characters especielly Electronik, Olga Dmitrievna and Zhenya wasn't that well developed and I would have loved an ending for these characters! :D\n- For me I could feel which of the characters the developers liked the most, so some characters weren´t that developed even some of the main girls :/\n- yeah.... the main character, which you play, can sometimes be quite annoying as hell! and I understand why some people hate him and say that he is bland and such. But the main character just suffers from twillight syndrome, Bella who is a character without really any character at all so it is easier for anyone(mostly twillight fangirls) to put themselves in her place. Quite luckily the main character in this game is not as bland as her! still a lot of character, thoughts and such (some might be unlogical and annoying. :P ) He is a whiner, get over it! make him happy, that is your purpose of playing this game :P get him out of his misery\n- Maybe I just have seen too many animes  especially Higurashi no naku koro ni, Clannad and little busters but they gave me the tools to already almost correctly guess the plot from the very beginning\n- Even though there is a lot to the story, it stills have a problem like all other dating visual novels.. The girls falls in love with main character with nearly no reason for doing so! Some are understandable, some aren't\n\nThis visual novel is the best one I have tried so far :) very interesting, I really loved to get to know the whole story and know every secret in the game. On the other hand it wasn't perfect at all! but good enough for me to keep on playing and enjoying it!! ^^","May 26","true","19.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Could it be that us Americans are too close minded to the natural aspect of sexuality.  Let's face it, the stork does not exist.  Our mommy and daddy had sex.  The story is not pornographic at all.  True enough, it has nudity and possible sexual elements (that I have seen so far...and been through several endings), but only if you add the program to unlock it.  This story to enlightening and powerful to have such a harsh rating as Steam services have given it.  Most that play these game (on Steam) are 18 years or older.  I would have to claim, they know about the human body and it functions by now.  I would like to ask Steam to reevaluate what they have written by exploring this/these stor(ies) (by each special endings) in every detail and rewrite their review/raking.  The heart of "Everlasting Summer" is not about loving making in a physical/sexual means.  I believe the core theme of this graphic novel is enlightenment to the highest degree.  Since love making/sex is apart of natural livelihood, then it is not inappropriate to have natural nudity, very minor sex references, and all the rest that I have not directly experienced yet of this wonderful and powerful storyline.  I think Steam needs to make their customers aware of these elements and let them decide how to live their own lives.

The final ending in this game (as any another possible ending trying to explain something) left me quite confused. Maybe it all turned better if endings were a bit more open? Some things does not need an explanation, it's mostly up to player's imagination in such complicated stories.\n\nSome CG-pictures needs fixing. Some character' sprites too.\n\nBUT. In case of this game this is all so secondary, so unnecessary.\n\nAtmosphere. It gets you entirely caught in the process of completing a novel. It never makes you feel bored. Music, backgrounds, many dialogue lines are arranged in such a good order, that at times I was nearly crying like a teenage girl. Heh. Maybe I'm just too emotional. Anyway atmosphere is the best feature of this game. It almost makes you think, that most of this game's media content was borrowed from some professionally made commercial product. And totally no. It all was composed and drawn by a group of freakin' anonymous image board users (Russian imageboard iichan.hk)! Do you believe me?! I was shocked. And yet I was admired by the work done. Yeah they worked on the game for a long time (five years to be precise) but their work was not in vain. It surely counts!\n\nAlso checked this novel in English and Russian. In Russian it is EVEN MORE atmospheric. So, cease to impose sanctions for Russia and go learn Russian language! Now! Or you'll never be able to get into it fully!\n\nWell just kidding :) But some typical Russian emotions can't be transferred completely using English. Well-tried.\n\nIn conclusion. Those who think that this game is stupid and boring, you must reconsider. Or you are just jealous. Sic!\n\nP.S.: Oh, I forgot, I forgot.

It was a visual novel as anyone could see but as I sat,reading it aloud to a friend, I was blown away from how intrigued I was of the storyline and the relaxing and tranquil art style. It brings a unique sense of feeling, a feeling of nostalgia. The story itself is meant for more mature audiences as I seemed to grasp,not to say it is innappropriate but that the story has some deep meaning, nostalgia, melancholy and may result in serious thinking but good experiences. I have experienced two of the thirteen I believe there is, endings. I was happy with both,one happier and the other seemed a bit unsettling at first but I later learned it was more deep and it had a lot of meaning behind it. The story itself, I believe holds a lot of meaning behind what someone might perceive there to be at first glance or being recently just have started the novel. It started off just as a convenient way to spend time on a winter evening but it turned into a overall satisfying experience and I is why I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in a good read and is looking for a deep story and some beautiful art to go along with it.","November 30, 2014","true","10.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The main girls are on a fairly familiar spectrum (kind big sister, genki kid, rebel tsundere, shy yandere) and the short chronological span of the story doesn't allow them much character development, but they're very likable all the same. The unique setting (a late Soviet era youth camp) pulls a lot of weight, managing to be nostalgic even with the cultural oddities. In fact, the cultural oddities were one of the best parts for me; while the game still uses plenty of standard VN/anime tropes, it was nice to see something so different from a generic Japanese High School. Visually, while some of the full-screen CGs do look a little amateur, the character sprites are cute, and the backgrounds and music are really beautiful, also doing a lot for the 'mood' of the game and it's setting.\n\nBut there's a lot more here than just the first glance, and this is what makes this game stand out above even some more 'professional' VNs. Each route hints at a bigger picture, and as you move from the 5 basic good endings (and one of the bad endings in particular), to the first and then second bonus routes, and finally to the DLC route, the story becomes increasing psychological and philosophical - and also a bit more heart-wrenching.In fact, the game develops into something that is on par with Higurashi in terms of minscrews and occasional horror. There's also something deliciously meta about the game's plot, as it deals with alternate, repeating realities even as the human at the keyboard loops through multiple new games and save-reloads to see them. YOU are the one tormenting poor Semyon!\n\nP.S. If you make an Olga Dmitrievna route, I'll GIVE YOU MONEY.\n\nShe seems like she would have been a better fit for the final route than Yulya, whether as the camp's avatar or itsfirst 'victim'.","February 25, 2015","true","17.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It has a marvelous amout of content, extremely well drawn backgrounds and character designs, lovely music, well developed character personalities, a facinating story, and, I think above all, the ability to evoke profound feelings that I haven't had brought forth by many things, let alone visual novels. Also this particular VN gives its audience the ability to choose, and the choices are many and various.\n\nDepending on your choices, you can influence the story, raise your reputation with various girls, and bring about your future, be it demise or happiness. It is quite immersive, and it's very easy to get absorbed into the enviroment and atmosphere. It is extremely fulfilling to win over a character by getting the good ending, though the bad endings are equally interesting. The story is sectioned off wonderfully, and if you want answers, you must first achieve the task of getting the good ending with all of the girls.\n\nThe only qualm I have with this VN is the occasional repetitiveness of beginning a new game after playing through once. I found myself skipping much of the text I'd already read the first time, which can something lighten the deep immersion I felt when first reading the intellectual speculations of Semyon, the protagonist, and the pleasant banter between characters.\n\nOverall, I found Everlasting Summer to be an immensely satisfying and fulfulling experience, and I would recommend it to most anyone.\n\nPlus, there's a catgirl, and who doesn't like those?","April 23, 2015","true","42.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

The story has a bunch of holes and the sprites are not usually what you would find in the average VN (something by Key, Nitro+, 5pb etc); they're more cartoon-like.\n\nWhy is it an 7.5/10? I considered the fact that it's a community made VN, similar to Katawa Shoujo, and that there are numerous redeeming qualities of the game. While some of the artwork is sub-par, I find the backgrounds nice to look at. The story is full of holes but is emotionally appealing a.k.a. it's got feels. Story is extremely important to me, more so than art. If you don't think too much about the story, which you shouldn't because VN = multiple routes = certain details revealed on certain routes = inevitable holes, then the VN is extremely enjoyable.\n\nI'm still working on getting all the endings but I'd say the game is worth your time if you're into VNs. I feel like it's not a VN that sells itself solely on the fact that it has nudity and other sex-related aspects in it, but rather with its story. Then again it's not even really "selling" itself, because it's free.\n\nThe only actual pressing problem I have with this game is that I can't find a text log.","November 20, 2014","true","2.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","3"

It cost you nothing!!\n\nIt doesn't looks so but it is an aboslutly great experience what they put together and so I highly recomment it!!\n\nHowever lets start from the beginning:\n\nThis Game started anyoing. There is nothing to do than read and read an never ending "intro" with some pictures. That's really not how to catch attention. I honestly was close to delete it after 5 minutes. But I am glad I didn't. I skipped most of the intro since honestly it was unitersting to read and too long. If it had been read (audiobook whise) then it might be different.\n\nThe next "bad" point was to figure out that there is no voice acting. I somehow had expected this in such a game on steam.\n\nAnd the third "bad" thing was to figure out that it is not a "game" nothign where you walk around free and click things or search and solve..no..it's more a story book you read and click through. There are only a few stops where you are offered decisions you can choose.\n\nBut this points aside.. ..once you are in the camp it's great. Nice different girls characters and with everyone you experience a really different story.\n\nThe replay value of this Game is at maximum. It's even so that if you don't play them all you miss stories that are much deeper and very different from what you expected then it looks at first.\n\nStroywhise what's in there in content is breath taken. You play the game and get one ending and you see alright thats the game. A pioneers camp. You are 17 and having fun an hit on the girls and end with one or not. But then there are much more twistet and interesting stories which you will discover later if you continue to complete every girls route. (best with a guide)\nBut be warned it becomes more and more to read. :)\n\nPro:\n+ 100% free.\n+ The fast forward key (Tab) !! Makes it very replay capable.\n+ Music just love it when the harder music kicks in when you stand in front of the more wild girls\n+ Very high replayability.\n+ Stories and more Stories and deeper stories ... and different and twisted. It's very interesting and it all comes together ..that game is not as shallow as it looks at first\n+ Adult content by default off\n+ The different Characters.\n+ Your choose matters and lead to very different stories..(not so visible at first)\n\n\nCon:\n- A lot to read\n- no voice acting\n- limited freedom: The most  part it is ust a story book where you read watch and click through it. (Although yes it is interesting)\n- The harder Adult content is disturbing. I am not offended by such content not at all but this Game doesn't really need it. It makes it look cheeper that it has to be.\n- Some bad endings are not so easy stuff. (shocking pictures)\n- seems a bit hard to figure out what ending you will get without a guide\n","November 23, 2014","true","35.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

Another thing is that it isn't at all bad. The Semyon (the protagonist) gets a bit iffy on certain endings but over all the story is pretty enjoyable. It sets up an interesting tone from the start and leaves you wondering, for the most part.\n\nThe game also originally launched with erotic content included as it is an eroge, this was removed from the steam version but googling will find a fix for you. I personally prefer the story, TV Tropes post game taught me that.\n\nOver all it's pretty solid.  A good amount of replayablity with 13 endings and a lot of soul put into the game.\n\nPROS:\n-Good music\n-Good art\n-Decent story\n-Multiple endings\n\nCONS:\n-Lack of automatic resolution selection\n-Some minor translation hiccups in a few places\n-A certain part can be very confusing to wander through without a map, roughly half way through the game. Breaks the imersion if you need one.\n\nOver all it is not a bad game. It's by no means the greatest. For a visual novel on steam, though, it is pretty competent and I can safely reccomend it.

I'm somewhat in the former which is part of the reason this game is so much of an impact to me (aside from my tendency to sympathize with characters easily). I'd definitely say it's worth the 5-10 hours, especially since it's free.\n\nI should say now too that the game is very story driven and (despite the character's "appearances") this game is not a hentai game. At best (or worst depending on perspective) it's a decent erotica game but even then only for the interactions with other characters. More than that, the game focuses on (again as 石井四郎 said) themes of maturing.\n\nOverall, I'd say confidently (rare from someone paranoid/cautious like me) that this is the BEST game I've ever played in terms of everything.","March 22, 2015","true","13.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are numerous options and multiple endings, both good and bad, giving it a lot of replay value. Aside from that, the character art is wonderful and the backdrops are gorgeous. Though there is no voice acting, the music gives the game plenty of personality. This game was not originally made in English but I am thoroughly impressed with the translation, it's well-written and comprehensible. The story itself is an interesting one, with lots of mystery, humor and drama. The characters are all unique and interesting, and I really appreciate all the inside jokes and nods toward various anime and visual novel sources which gives the game a very tongue-in-cheek attitude.The developers of this game seem truly passionate about their work and connected to the fans of the game, and it shows in the final product. They also continue to add to the story and update with alternate routes and endings, which can also be modified by other users and submitted via the Workshop (which is slowly growing). This feature alone adds endless replayability and also makes the game incredibly unique among other visual novels on Steam. I would love to see more like it.","January 6, 2015","true","8.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is translated from the original Russian, so it's slightly stilted in parts, but not too badly. It's well worth playing all the good endings, since they tell an overarching (semi) cohesive story. The two Lena endings particularly struck me, with the bad one being heartbreaking and the good one heartwarming.

Reason? They made me enjoy reading this wonderful work. The routes are well done and I can see much improvement however I can state that the way the storytelling went hit on par to make me think. I enjoyed reading. The CG work is well put. The scenes on some routes and discussions I found truly interesting and engrossing. If you want a game to play that makes you think, has dating sim, multiple routes, good and bad ends, this game provides more than just that. There are guides to help and there is a patch available for some of you. I have to say this was a good piece of work and I would look forward to more from them. I do admit I wish there was room for Olga and the Doctor however the game itself did genuine profound work to keep me playing it. As well as make me think. I admit that one of these routes had me by the balls of a surprise. In order to achieve a lot of things here, multiple playthroughs are required not the one by pass and go. The choices do count and there is a point system. Very well done and It is free.

I enjoyed this way more than I probably should have... given I'm a grown man and this deals mostly with teeangers.\n\nAt first I was dismayed by the pantyshots (am not into fan-service that much) and erotic depictions of the people, the game could do just as good without them. I overlooked that/tried not to be disturbed by it too much, expected even some heavy hentai at some point, but as I kept reading/watching, I got more and more emotionally involved with the protagonist, who's RL I can relate to quite a lot, and the people he gets to know.\n\nIn my first playthrough - and that's what you should do too - I just kept following my intuitions and as such, was rewarded with the intented ending. It's clear that the devs didn't want to primarily make this an 18+ game but the reason for that is there. Only once you get to know the full story and all the characters you might be able to shoot for a different game over scenario.\n\nEspecially if you like Manga/Anime, the twists of the story and character adaptions based on your choices make this novel not only great and fun to watch, but just plain awesome - would be fantastic Anime material! It also gave me PSD, and I wish I could forget that I already experienced this and relive it all again... great "game".\n\nEdit: removed spoilers, shortened text","November 22, 2014","true","39.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

He wakes up on a hot midsummer day on another empty bus, Twilight Zone style. The bus is parked before an idyllic-seeming, picturesque Soviet-era Pioneer youth camp in the middle of nowhere. No driver, no cellphone bars.\n\nSemyon reacts to this mysterious phenomenon by having a panic attack: he curls up in a ball and rolls in the grass wailing "WHY ME?" for a while. I'm not totally averse to psychologically damaged protagonists, but this is a dating sim. What do the camp girls find appealing about this pathetic self-described loser?\n\nBut when I focused on solving its central supernatural mystery on my first playthrough, I was hooked by a compelling and creepy story. The game's mysteries only unravel through multiple playthroughs, with 13 endings varying greatly in tone from heartwarming to bittersweet to wretched to nightmare fuel. Its most revealing endings only get unlocked after all 6 good endings have been reached.\n\nThe game also has affection for its setting, evoking such nostalgia for Soviet Pioneer camps than even I, a Yank who's never been to the USSR, felt twinges of sentimentality for them by the time I was through.\n\nExceptional music and background art, but character portraits look quite amateurish. Before playing, I recommend subscribing to and activating Orika's Sprites and CG mod from the Steam Workshop to improve their quality. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=366163610\n\nThe English translation from Russian unfortunately contains many misspellings, malaprops, and grammatical errors that may grate the nerves of sensitive readers, though the intent is usually clear. It helpfully supplies info boxes explaining Russian cultural references for Western audiences, though you're on your own with the anime and sci-fi/fantasy references. (An early joke referencing Ryūgū Rena from Higurashi no Naka Koro ni went right over my head.)\n\nThough Everlasting Summer contains gratuitous cheesecake and sex scenes, dirty pictures have been expurgated from this Steam release. A patch to restore them can be downloaded from the game's website ( http://everlastingsummer.su ).\n\nEverlasting Summer is very unpolished in parts and still has much room for improvement despite its five years of development, but I'll cut it a lot of slack since it's a free VN made by dedicated amateurs. I can't fairly call it good, but parts of it are excellent.","January 19, 2015","true","40.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Yes. Did I continuously feel like throwing things out the window whilst playing her route? Yes. Will I finish Ulyana's route to appease my completionist OCD right now? No. Screw that. Maybe I'll touch it sometime next week but I sure as hell am not going anywhere near her for awhile.\n\nI installed Everlasting Summer on a complete whim and didn't expect much at all. Going into it without hope, I was pleasantly thrown in for a loop. The music and the art cards are fantastic (both of which can be listened to/viewed in their appropriate galleries after clearing) and the story is mildly interesting. To be honest, there were quite a few times when the OST smacked me right in the feels and had me wondering if I was facing an existential crisis or not .. The character art style is somewhat awkward and a bit cringe-worthy (at times) but is easily overlookable the more you go down the rabbit hole. There's a downloadable "hentai patch" that can supply a nice CG break from what may sometimes feel like ~everlasting dialogue~ and there are enough possible routes/endings to keep you entertained for quite awhile. All in all, Everlasting Summer is a surprisingly enjoyable (if not somewhat disturbing) VN that should warrant a try from any fan of the genre, especially for fans of Higurashi-esque series.\n\nMy only important complaint?

On the surface, it might seem like a pretty average anime styled visual novel with the same plot line as every other similar story.\n\nHowever, Everlasting Summer is not your typical game with a typical story line.\nIf you do choose to venture into this game, nothing seems too unusual, but various things will start to transpire as the story goes on. As it is a visual novel, you do have the ability to change your course in the story in order to unlock 13 brilliantly vivid endings. Even though I have only unlocked 4 of these endings at the moment, I can safely say that each of them might torment you in various different ways, whether it be from heartbreak, longing, confusion, or horror. That being said,\n\nTHIS IS NOT A GAME FOR THE LIGHTHEARTED\n\nI stress this greatly because I made the mistake of thinking that this would be a fun and happy story as opposed to what it actually is. Without giving away spoilers, if you choose to play this game, be prepared to be creeped out and grossed out at times. (This only actually happens in 3 of the endings that I know of which are perhaps some of least expected and  more difficult ones to unlock, but can be unlocked accidentally nonetheless).\n\nThat being said, I still do recommend this game to those who are willing to immerse themselves in this. The interface of the entire game is very well done and even highlights faintly the choices that you did not take before so that you have a chance to uncover a new ending.  In addition, the story lines are spectacular and most of the art is pretty well done. (A few scenes here and there look a little out of place with the rest of the art style, but are not too bad). In addition, the interface of the entire game is very well done and even highlights faintly the choices that you did not take before so that you have a chance to uncover a new ending. Unfortunately, Steam has removed all of the pictures containing adult content, but it fortunately leaves the text alone and does not do much to disturb the actual story lines.\n\nPros:\nMany great storylines\nFun and interesting characters\nNice art style\n\nCons:\nStoryline can get intense at times\n\nOverall: 9.5/10 Definitely would recommend to those willing\n","November 24, 2014","true","24.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's a (recurring) story about a man who steps on a bus during the winter, quietly nods off to sleep while an old Soviet melody is playing and... he wakes up alone in the bus at a Russian pioneer camp during the summer.\n\nStory\nIf you thought that was bizarre, then you're thinking the same thing as our protagonist, Semyon. Are you going to find out what happened to you? Or do you pursue socializing with the local pioneers? With a bunch of routes and endings, Everlasting Summer is sure to give you an interesting experience with a variety of endings.  In the end, there's also a story holding the subsequent playthroughs together. (There's time travel; there's an explanation why you are playing through the game multiple times. This is quite in depth once you hit the final secret routes.) Complete all the endings for the best experience!\n\nTranslation\nEverlasting Summer was originally a Russian VN, but it has been translated to English. EDIT: Translation is fixed.\n\nGraphics\nIn terms of graphics, the characters and backgrounds are nicely done, but the CG is inconsistent which can be jarring. But since CG is only a small part of the game, that can be forgiven. (Again, the CG isn't bad, it's just inconsistent with the main style of the game.) The backgrounds are the most impressive and varied.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack contains a ton of tracks. In fact, the soundtrack might be one of the best things about this (free) visual novel. The main theme is memorable and there are some good-sounding tracks. The soundtrack also does a great job giving you the right feeling for each scene.\n\nConclusion\nRegardless, Everlasting Summer is a solid read, and for the amazing price of free, you can't go wrong with this. If you enjoy visual novels this is pretty much a good pick. If you want to give this kind of storytelling (visual novel) a try, this is a good point to start if you can stand the inconsistent art (which is a minor complaint.) The story is pretty damn good so you probably won't mind.\n\nFinal verdict: RECOMMENDED","January 4, 2015","true","16.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a mostly enjoyable visual novel, with a few gripes and hiccups along the way.\n\nFirstly, the art sits somewhere in the uncanny valley.  At times it looks just fine, then at other times it's just a bit off.  But the backgrounds are often quite detailed and of high quality.\n\nThe 4 main heroins all have some problems.  Slavya just kind of generally exists, and isn't very compelling. Ulyana is generally a but too impulsive and often idiotic and immature, but that's kind of the point... or something. Lena is... yeah... this isn't going to be what you expect, and it doesn't feel as well executed as it could have been.

One story-part takes several hours (i spend nearly 7-8 for only one story-part). There are 13 endings which are all different. Some can have an happy end, other endings can be really depressing. Which ending do you get decides your relationship to the girls which you will meet, and your relationship goes up or down with your decisions.\n\nSo many girls...\nOn your journey you will meet some girls. All of these girls have their own personalities which is very different to the other ones. So every moment with one of these girls creates its own atmosphere and emotions.\n\nWait, how much endings?\nAll endings are unique, but which ending is the true ending? Is there a true ending? Without spoiling i only can say, play till the very end. Play to the last ending. It's worth it. After you get the last ending you will see a large whole which will amaze you.\n\nNeed I say more?\nThis game has an fantastic Soundtrack, so some great songs will awaits you and if you play all options, which the game offers you (different decisions, visited places, etc.), you will get lots of fantastic artworks too. If you want to see all artworks (includes the missing erotic scenes), look for the patch in the steam-community.\n\nTo bring bring it to the point: phenomenal visual novel and it's for free! 9,5/10\n\nIn summary:\nPro        Contra                + many endings        - no voice acting                + interessting charakters                + unbelievable story                + many decisions                + workshop for additional stories etc.                + free to play\n\nPS: I just wanted to write a short review, which brings the essence of the game to the point.

Somewhat typical and expected of a dating sim game, but the better charcaters of this game (at the time of the review): Alisa, Slavya, Lena, Miku\n-Nice looking female characters (as expected of a dating sim, but especially nice since everyone's wearing identical costumes). the character designs are a good in between; not too extreme but not too generic.\n*** - The creators of the game proofread the English version, so most of the typos and lose English is fixed, though you may still occasionally see Alisa's name listed as Alice in some dialouge boxes. For those who've already played the game or have old save files however, you may not be able to fast-forward as much as you want because the new English Proofread dialouge counts as 'unseen' text that you may not be able to skip past.\n- Semyon is a very interesting character. You play the game from his point of view but he's very different from other dating sim male leads i've played as thus far. He actively questions what's going on around him and i've often found myself relating to him in the various situations he gets himself in and feeling the same way toward the girls he intereacts with (for better of for worse). He's very smart for a player-avatar character and i wish more of these types of characters come to future dating sims (especially when the lead is a female).\n-  Depending on which girl you pursue, you'll find that the story's genre may even change (at least that's how i saw it). Different things will happen, some things will have been real, other things will have just been a beautiful dream, you may even see that your dreams came true in some form should Semyon wake up at all. It makes me want to get all of the endings and achievements to see what's actually Semyon's reality and what's his dream! BRAVO DEVS, BRAVO!\n\n\nCons:\n\n-If you're a grammer Nazi, good luck reading this game in English... Everything from simple typos to ordering of words and even character names can be messed up (most notable with Alisa, whose name can appear as Alice in the dialouge box) ***\n-No gay routes, only hetero routes (though because this game is originally Russian, I can't exactly blame them for that)\n-All of the characters with the exceptions of the ones i mentioned above... ARE ANNOYING AND/OR DATING SIM STEREOTYPES. Ulyana is an extremely annoying child (why can no one ever write a child character that isn't the devil, annoying or both?), Olga is extremely bossy (if i read the phrase 'line-up' one more time i might stab my computer screen and i think Seymon feels the same way), Electronik and Shurik are typical male characters in dating sims in that they either encourage hooking-up, force the player into doing something they normally wouldn't do or just being in the background compared to the main female characters of the game. And of the two other male characters, i find that only Electronik is helpful and at least somewhat interesting.\n-All of the female character's I've mentioned in the con's part of the review also seem to suffer from the rapidest of mood swings. Olga is nice one second, the next second she's like a dictator; Ulyana is still extremely annoying and Zhenya seems to go from a nuetral mood to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off for no reason within seconds. You may argue that the tsundere of the game, Alisa, also has these rapid mood swings but at least hers are enjoyable to watch and read and she isn't as bossy as Olga and  her moodswings are explained somewhat in her route as well as hinted at in Lena's . In addition Alisa has her sweet/adorable moments unlike any of the female characters i've mentioned in the cons.\n- After a while you feel like you're dragging Semyon through one event after the other. You are given some choices which will help you in getting the different endings but after a few playthroughs you already know you'll have to do certain tasks without any yes or no and you'll be forced to do them over and over again. It'll feel like a pain after a while, but this is remedied somewhat because Semyon is very nice and relatable (at least to me).\n-This game's setting is set in a time during the USSR, which makes a history-lover like myself want just a little more history in the game or at least some more history trivia\n\n\nOverall, this game is free to play and so i can complain all i want, but hey i payed nothing for it. The annoying characters are still annoying as hell, the other male characters just seem to be there for the sake of being there like typical 'best friend' male characters in these kinds of games, the English translation was proofread and the text is easier to read now. And the characters who i mentioned in the Pros are enjoyable and easy to get along with. AND IT'S STILL FREE!\n\nI give this game 4.5 beautiful summers out of 5","November 28, 2014","true","29.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

In my opinion, it was way too verbose and unnecessary at many points, specially when the main character is talking to himself. Alone. Like... a lot. I almost quit at the beginning.\n\nIn spite of those near-showstoppers, the game is good, and that's because of the OTHER characters, they have quite of a depth in them.

Your perspectives will change.\n\nI WAS hint the past tense. severly disappointed that Miku was portrayed as a annoying splinter in your backside with Semyon trying all in his power to avoid any possible future encounter with her by being cold and leaving prematurely as when she's still talking. But I have to say that was pretty hilarious. That hasn't at all changed the rating or recommendation of this review, it compensated it with comedy.\n\nWorth playing, and there's nothing to lose.\nRecommended (Y)","January 12, 2015","true","30.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So, here it goes, my first review:\n\nI must admit,I downloaded it because I was in the mood for playing a VN with a bit of adult content but I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary. So I started playing. And I played and played and played for 6 full hours before getting the first ending. Sure,the game is Russian so the anime-style girls are not beautifully drawn,but still... After I finished it I couldn't stop thinking about this game and about "Sovionok" (which is the name of the camp in which the story unfolds) because the beauty of this VN isn't the visual part,it's the story,the emotions that you get when reading. Yeah,it had a great impact on me like no game ever had. And after you'll finish it,you'll experience "video-game hangover" xD But enough of my impressions,let's get to the actual review. The way the game is realised isn't the best,I think it could have been more dynamic. Like if you could explore the camp by yourself,through a map. Anyway,it's good as it is. The art, as I said, isn't extraordinary. I even found a few flaws in the drawings,but nothing exceptional and you surely won't see them if you don't look very closely and don't concentrate that much. The soundtrack is BEAUTIFUL,I really enjoyed it and it suits the environment. And the story... Well,I'm out of words for this one.\n\nAll in all,this game is ABSOLUTELY wonderful and a "should play" for everyone that is capable of enjoying a story.","February 17, 2015","true","29.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Just spam "Go right" and you win.\n-Almost every girl is a reference to a Russian 2ch persona or mascot. The summer camp the protagonist is taken to is inspired by a real camp in Russia. That means you can let your weaboo out in the real world without looking completely pathetic. Go for it, man.\n-BIG RUSSIAN TEETEES, NIKO!\n\n-Time to get serious-\n\nSoundtrack is 11/10 - I've spent atleast [current hours minus 20] hours just listening to the music and not actually playing the game.\n\nBackgrounds 10/10 - Not a single one feels out of place, and they're amazing. Some person actually spent their time drawing grass and river reflections. This kind of attention to detail is definitely above and beyond; whoever drew the BG art definitely needs recognition, if they havent gotten it already.\n\nCharacters 9.5/10 - All the girls are qt3.14s and there's some guys too, good balance. Protagonist is just some dude with no eyes, though. Kinda bland. Gotta have some sort of self-insert, right?\n\nOverall, would unironically recommend to all friends who asked about it.","March 15, 2015","true","218.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Over 11,000 positive reviews and less than 700 negative reviews on a free game isn't just a sign, it's a wake up call to everyone.\n\nPlay this game. Play it over and over again. It's not a typical dating sim in the slightest. While I do refuse to spoil even the slightest bit of this game, I can't emphasise this enough. It certainly looks like one on the surface and takes a while to really get to the juicy bits, but there's no reason everyone shouldn't give this game a shot. The plot once you dive in is nothing short of mind-bending.\n\nDon't expect to get every reference unless you lived in the USSR during the era this game takes place. But don't let that stop you from enjoying what I will happily call one of my top three favorite games of 2015. (Yeah, I was late to the party.)\n\n12 and a half hours is what it took me to see everything. Every normal ending, two bad ends, and the several secret endings.

Do you remember summer nights, awkward teenage romance, days that last forever, but seem to end before you know it?\nThis 'game' is a romance visual novel set in, of all places, a Soviet-era youth summer camp, where the protagonist somehow ends up after boarding a bus in modern-day Russia.\nIf you've ever played a visual novel before, you know how it works, click through the text, making choices when it lets you, watching the character and background art slide by, like raindrops down a window.\nThe aforementioned art is nothing special, in fact it gets straight amateurish at times, and sometimes it's enjoyable, but nothing too special.\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, properly reinforcing the moods of the scenes, and sticking with (at least me) you for a while after playing.\nThe characters are variable in execution, and tend to lean on archetypes a little much, but they all have their own little ticks that make them stand out.\nThe real meat of what this is, however, isn't in the art, the story itself, or even the beautiful soundtrack.  It's in the overall atmosphere, the sense of long-gone summers and those young romances that are almost too awkward to bear, yet you wouldn't change them for the world.  It's the nostalgia emanating from every earnest pore of this freeware VN, made by -chan anons over several years, much like the lauded Katawa Shoujo.\nIf you're the type to get misty-eyed over graduation slideshows, songs like Summer of '69, Good Riddance (Time of your Life) or to keep a photo album, or if you're in the mood for an amateur, if earnest and heartfelt, romance story.  I'd reccommend spending a few hours clicking through.\n(Just not Miku's route, GabeN save us from that horror...)","February 28, 2015","true","22.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Do you remember summer nights, awkward teenage romance, days that last forever, but seem to end before you know it?\nThis 'game' is a romance visual novel set in, of all places, a Soviet-era youth summer camp, where the protagonist somehow ends up after boarding a bus in modern-day Russia.\nIf you've ever played a visual novel before, you know how it works, click through the text, making choices when it lets you, watching the character and background art slide by, like raindrops down a window.\nThe aforementioned art is nothing special, in fact it gets straight amateurish at times, and sometimes it's enjoyable, but nothing too special.\nThe soundtrack is beautiful, properly reinforcing the moods of the scenes, and sticking with (at least me) you for a while after playing.\nThe characters are variable in execution, and tend to lean on archetypes a little much, but they all have their own little ticks that make them stand out.\nThe real meat of what this is, however, isn't in the art, the story itself, or even the beautiful soundtrack.  It's in the overall atmosphere, the sense of long-gone summers and those young romances that are almost too awkward to bear, yet you wouldn't change them for the world.  It's the nostalgia emanating from every earnest pore of this freeware VN, made by -chan anons over several years, much like the lauded Katawa Shoujo.\nIf you're the type to get misty-eyed over graduation slideshows, songs like Summer of '69, Good Riddance (Time of your Life) or to keep a photo album, or if you're in the mood for an amateur, if earnest and heartfelt, romance story.  I'd reccommend spending a few hours clicking through.\n(Just not Miku's route, GabeN save us from that horror...)","February 28, 2015","true","22.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

My experience was entirely different, and I came to love it. The thing is.... it's not a game about romance. Not really. And while I had a fictional-character-crush on Alisa and wanted a more satisfying ending, that's really not what this game is about. It's about mystery, about understanding who one is and choosing whether or not to chance. The girls are there, and you can indeed romance many of them.... but it's about the self-revelation one has by spending time with them. In dialectical terms, they are the antithesis to the thesis of your main character's status quo, and the exploration of these storylines produce the synthesis you end with. Romance can be a part of it, but in a way, it can also be extraneous because it's about a transformation of the self and the choice between living a flavorless, reclusive life and one of joy and abundance.   So far as I've yet seen, there's not so much a  trite "she made me a better man", as the contrast of a girl's character and the interactions you have giving the main character a new perspective if he chooses to look. From this vantage, he can change. Or, I suppose, not.\n\n\nSo, if you're in it for the romance, you might be let down. But there's something more interesting going on here, and I now feel I can recommend it for people who want something more.\n\nOriginal review included below, as it may help illuminate my journey with this game to date.\n\n[Oy. This game.\n\nThere's so much to love about this game. The backgrounds are jaw-droppingly gorgeous. The sense of place and time it conveys is stunning, and the presentation is bright and inviting. The music, as well, is lovely. In terms of basic aesthetics, there is so much to love here, and I would almost recommend it on that basis alone.\n\nCulturally, I find it fascinating as well. The sense of nostalgia for one's youth  is universal. It takes place in the Soviet equivalent of the scout camps of my youth, so is relatable. From my cultural context, that it is bright and positive from the perspective of a kid in the former USSR is quite interesting.  Most of the game takes place in the early/mid 1980's. As a kid of roughly the same age in that timeframe  in the USA, it's fascinating to see memories of that time and place from the other side of the cold war. There was an awareness, before the fall of the Soviet Union, that they were not so different from us, as a people. This kinda was lost in the "We won, you lost" attitude after that fall of that system, but it's nice to see a representation..... fictional but based on the creators' memories.... of my Soviet counterparts.\n\nAlas, the story... the story.\nThe characters are all basic anime tropes, except possibly, one. She has more going on than one can see on a surface level, but I didn't follow her path. The rest all fall into the usual categories. Super positive beautiful girl, impish younger girl, angry and abrasive girl with a heart of gold. They're all represented. It's to be expected, and I don't fault the creators for bringing out these types. After all, interesting stories can still be told with them. I followed the angry girl, as the prickly hotheaded type with a soft and vulnerable core always appeals to be. Truth be told, I had intended to follow them all except for the younger girl. But angry girl, Alisa, had to be first.\n\nShe delivered, to a great extent. There were those moments of vulnerability, the clumsy ways of trying to express affection.... all the things I find adorable. So what could go wrong?  Well, in the end, they just didn't sell it. There wasn't the payoff. Oh, sure, for those who just wanna get to the sex scene, that happens (although tastefully blacked out in this version). But the emotional arc never pays off, and the point of view character is infuriatingly passive aggressive. Almost to the last, he's unable to express any emotion. Indeed. he seems so annoyed by her that the last minute "oh, I guess I love you" rings false. There's no believable "She's annoying, but  there's something about her" moments building throughout her arc, so when they toss that in at the end, it just doesn't seem feasible. Furthermore, there was no investment in giving any reason for her attraction to our POV character. It just happened because, of course it has to. But no reason for the attraction on her part is given, nor hinted at. This sort of visual novel hinges on satisfying romantic arcs, and in Alisa's case, it's clumsy and doesn't work.\n\nOf course, there are other arcs, and mysteries that go unexplained in the path I took. However, the way Alisa's story falls flat, and misses it's chances to sell the romance... well, I don't feel inclined to explore further. In a game like this, that is a failure.\n\nThere's a lot to recommend in this game, but overall? I just can't give this the thumbs up. It comes so close to being amazing, but that makes the fumbled story arc I followed all the more frustrating. Perhaps other paths are better and at any rate t's free, so if you have nothing better to do and little money, I guess give it a shot. Otherwise, look elsewhere.]","May 1","true","66.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Far better than you can expect from the game made by the large group of unorganized people.\nArt is a little bit various from screen to screen. Backgrounds are beautiful, characters sometimes rough, sometimes OK, sometimes good. Overall, i can say that while having some good artists among the devs, this game lacks art-direction.\nThe storyline - a totally different situation. Story is good, it has some well-made WTF-moments, and it really takes several playthroughs to figure it out. The protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and a lot of dialogues are awkward, but this story has it's own charm. It takes some time and effort to see it.\n\nThe game was initially written in russian, and english translation is not as good as the original text. But it seems that they are working to improve it.\n\nMusic is amazing. Including some soviet-themed tracks.\n\nSome say that this game is a hentai dating sim. That's not actually true. Though the game has some adult content (but not in Steam version), the game is good enough without it. Maybe even better. And it's totally not a sim, due to very little amount of choices. It's what it is - a good story with a little bit of interaction.\n\nThe game is free. Really free, no microtransactions, no strings attached.\n\nWorth your time, if you ask me.","November 29, 2014","true","15.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story is interesring, the characters are likeable and each of them has different quirks and behaviors. Regardless of which path you choose, this game will leave you with a bittersweet taste which will make you come back to it just because you want to experience more of it.\n\nIt's not terribly long so it's perfect for people who want to get into simple Visual Novels as a genre, it is fun, spooky at times, interesting and a single playthrough won't let you touch all the details and hidden events that happen at the magical Sovionok camp.\n\nI definitely recommend this game, play it, it's free and it will be a memorable experience.","November 26, 2014","true","16.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I loved this game very much, it has a lot of entertaining scenes and a lot of surprising moments. I like that it let's you choose your path, but some of the parameters for certain endings, especially Ulyana's good ending, are so specific that you practically have to look at the walkthrough. And a walkthrough doesn't necessarily hurt after your first two or three endings. I certainly recommend this game and would encourage players to download a certain file (found here https://vk.com/topic-62816733_31120658) and install it back to the game files.

I absolutely recommend it to fans of the genre. What sets it apart, for me, is that it actually has a storyline that attempts to give an in-game explanation for the visual novel game mechanics that encourage you to replay multiple times to experience the different routes. And replay you should, as this VN has a definitive end that you can only get by completing all the "good" routes. Not to mention there's one route that was pretty terrifying. I came for feels, not for scares! ^_-\n\nOne last thing: Go to the official website and get the "hentai" patch. It reintroduces artwork that was censored out for the Steam release.

Everything is so detailed. This game felt so beautiful until oh god,. until you see the sprites for the girls. these sprites are so bad it hurts. Even flash games you make when you're like 10 has better sprites than this. They're so ugly. However besides the uglyness the game does a few visual novel faux pas, like including vocaloid music and making a ♥♥♥♥ing miku copy. If those two things were removed and the sprites were polished the game would be worth buying.\n\nOne thing as a girl i'll say  the girls in the novel don't act or talk like a real life girl would. The whole story seems a bit " Guy with a fedora gets his lewd fantasies come true" ten minutes into the game we havea girl in a bikini. This is not a game like katawa shoujo that straight girls can enjoy, this is very much aimed for virgin fedora pony type men that have never talked to a girl. It's one of those suddenly this loner ugly fat guy gets laid type stories . One thing that bothers me is that this is literally a pedo game, you're like a 30 yeare old in a teenagers body trying to ♥♥♥♥ other teenagers..

It was a good re-introduction to this game genre, and won't be the last I play. The protagonist is Semyon, a 25ish reclusive guy living in a city in modern (21st century) Russia, who falls asleep on a bus and wakes up to find he's at a summer camp in the Soviet Union.\n\nThere are too many good points to list them all here, and I hope I don't forget any of the most important ones. The music (by Sergey Eybog, and by Between August and December) is outstanding and does an excellent job of setting the mood. The character art and backgrounds are all very well done. The "gallery" images are of inconsistent quality but many are very good. But that's all dressing - a visual novel, like any other story, is about plot, characters, and setting. The plot is well done, a dating sim game on the surface with a deeper plot that starts to become evident by the end of the first play-through and which isn't fully realized until you've explored all of the endings. The characters are enjoyable and well-developed, and the girls Semyon interacts with all turn out to be interesting and usually likeable in their own way. The setting, a pioneer camp in the Soviet Union in the mid-1980s, is used to good effect to tell the story. There are plenty of puzzles and surprises, and plenty of love and relationships, to be discovered.\n\nAnd now for the problems. My biggest complaint is how at times the dialogue and storytelling gets belabored and drags on and I just wish it would hurry up and get to the point - if I were beta-reading for a fiction writer (which I've done), there are places I would tell the author to tighten things up. All the pictures of Semyon show him with his hair over his eyes, which I gather is a trope used in many visual novels but it still bugs me. Sometimes the characters get too over-the-top emo (especially the one I found most likeable at first, but I can't say much without spoiling).\n\nDespite a few problems, it's an excellent game overall, one that will have me mulling over parts of the story for quite a while.\n\n8.5/10","February 5, 2015","true","26.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's worst in the game's prologue, when you're doing nothing but clicking through Semyon's dreary restlessness.\n\nThis is a visual novel, and the bulk of the story is your life at a Soviet youth camp, where you spend a few days trying to catch up on sleep, trying to make it to meals on time, and trying to do all the tasks that the camp coordinator gives you. But the story is given plenty of time to develop, and you're given lots of opportunities to get to know the other campers - most of whom are attractive young women with somewhat stereotypical personalities. The character artwork looks more like something from DeviantArt than professionally done, but the backgrounds are gorgeous, and the sound fits the mood.\n\nBut it's the end of the story where things get interesting and set the stage for another go-through (or several more). Unfortunately, given the sheer length of time it takes to click through the story sentence-by-sentence, once is enough for me.","February 8, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The setting and the playfulness of it is what really kept me interested.  The main problem i had with the story is that you never really get to know any of the heroines.  Although you spend a couple of days with them doing all kinds of stuff, you dont get to delve deeper into who they really are as in KS.  All in all a worthwhile read with some of the best looking backgrounds ive ever encountered in a VN.\n\nUpdate:  WOW!  Just finished the DLC Zhenya route and it really makes the whole journey complete.  A complete mindbender with some feels thrown at me in the end.  Good stuff guys.  Excellent work.

The story and characters are fascinating, and the main character is very easy to relate to. Unlike some of the other Novels I've played this one has quite a few choices which lead to variety of endings, and even a minigame. The english translation is a little rough around the edges, however I don't mind it did not effect the story for me. Since it has a lot of choices it seems the game will be highly replayable which is rare for a visual novel.

I'll pay nothing all day to visit a strange anime Soviet Russian alternate reality, where for some reason I become the object of numerous cute girls' affections.  Though things are not nearly so simple as that.\n\nYar, this be a visual novel / dating sim, but the storyline and artwork make it a deeper endeavor.  The story is at times dreamy, occasionally erotic, and at times outright creepsterish.  I found myself heart broken and with a vivid sense of longing.\n\nVery enjoyable gamepay but quite casual.  All you do is click your mouse button and read and look at half-naked anime chicks.  Oh well, I like to read.  AND ALL FO FREE.\n\nThere are lots of cute gals to chat up, and the artwork is rather charming.  Lots of blank screens though, making me question whether there is an uncensored version lurking about somewhere. . .\n\nThere are multiple endings to attain, all of which have achievements.  This makes it worth the multiple play-throughs for all those achievement junkies like me.  The endings are unique and vary greatly in where your character ends up.  Also, during multiple play-throughs, you have the ability to fast-forward through game sequences you have already experienced, and it automatically stops when you reach a part you haven't seen yet.\n\nKnowing what I know now, I would pay for this game.

I say this because of the immersion and character developement of the different people around you during those seven days. This game has some incredible story telling worthy or ranking above and beyond Life is Strange and The Walking Dead. There is also some amazing content and hidden story for the theorists of the world to uncover about this game like: where you are, why you are here and what this place is. The game also had some very creepy and dark themes to it like the old camp grounds which you visit on day 4. The diversity of all the characters and seeing them all thrown into one place just made the 'game' so much more enjoyable.\n\nCons- Of course no game is without its problems so here are a some of the problems I found.\ndificult to find specific endings for characters alone, the game has some incredible points in the story which it doesn't elaborate in too much detail and I found it difficult to 'like' some of the characters introduced.\n\nOverall I highly reccomend this game to EVERYONE even if its just to try it out or 'go out on a limb.' the game portrays and excellent contrast with the Russian setting compared to Russia at the time. This game is PERFECT for anyone even if you're not a fan of these types of games seeing as its a much more relaxed and calm experience which can still get very tense or creepy.

The english translation is a little rough around the edges, however I don't mind it did not effect the story for me.

I absolutely recommend it to fans of the genre. What sets it apart, for me, is that it actually has a storyline that attempts to give an in-game explanation for the visual novel game mechanics that encourage you to replay multiple times to experience the different routes. And replay you should, as this VN has a definitive end that you can only get by completing all the "good" routes. Not to mention there's one route that was pretty terrifying. I came for feels, not for scares! ^_-\n\nOne last thing: Go to the official website and get the "hentai" patch. It reintroduces artwork that was censored out for the Steam release. Despite the name, the reintroduced scenes are still pretty censored, but it's better than the screen fading to black.","February 15, 2015","true","20.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This is not a game for me simply because of that, but I'm looking past that to see what great work the developer/s put into this amazing story telling game. If you love a greatly detailed, beautifully written story, then this is the game for you. 10/10. The developer needs to put a price on this thing.

The production values are functional, and the art quality is all over the place. For example, the early pictures of Seymon are true works of art; meanwhile, a few of the more "ecchi" pics of the girls look like only moderately competent fan drawings. (For those of you installing the hentai patch, don't worry. The team clearly put a great deal of effort into the full-on hentai.) The expressions, while fairly well done, are somewhat limited and sometimes inappropriate to the text.\n\nBut the writing... dear God, that writing. I've played through seven different endings now (two versions of three different paths and one that seems to have only one version), and the endings are all different... and I mean *really* different, in terms of tone, and even genre. They range from really happy hopeful to dark as ♥♥♥♥ to... well, let's just say the achievement is literally titled, "What is this I don't even..." (The use of Internet memes is integral, with the characters being based off mascot characters on IIchan.ru, or so I have read.)\n\nThe logic of the paths generally makes some sort of sense. I had to hint guide some of it, but that's just because I'm impatient and didn't feel like exploring the story web relentlessly until I finally figured certain things out. If you play without one, you're probably going to need to document your findings. It's very complex, and very well done. Definnitely not a kinetic novel by any stretch of the term.\n\nOh, and did I mention it's free? Smart move on the part of Soviet Games. I'll definitely be paying attention to their future work, and am fully prepared to pay full freignt for their next game. Indeed, if they can get some polish on their presentation, I think we're looking at the emergence of one of the great studios.","March 26","true","25.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every story has its own outline, synopsis, key points, a prologue and an epilogue. And there is no book which, if you read it again, would not reveal new details you didn't notice before. Every story has its beginning and its end. Almost every...\n\nI picked up Everlasting Summer in early January 2016, because I was bored and curious what kind of game this is. I had never played a visual novel before, so I didn't really know what to expect, but this game completely got to me.\n\nYou play as this man in his late 30s who has a boring life, he is anti-social and spends most of his time alone on his computer in his flat. He goes to a class reunion and falls asleep in the bus. When he wakes up he notices he in a 1980s Russian pioneer camp. He also turns out to be 17 years old again. He is far away from home, in a different reality even. He stays there for a week and then goes home with the same bus (or doesn't he?).\n\nIt seems that he lives the same week in the camp over and over again. When he tries to leave after a week, he wakes up in the camp again and the whole story restarts. Can he get out? Does he even want to get out? He is the only real human in the fake reality in which he ended up.\n\nIn this camp he meets all kind of different characters, most of them are girls and he can get attached to them. This leads up to 13 different endings, which take quite some time to complete, but are very story rich and interresting. I would say it is kinda a mind♥♥♥♥ story, if you have done several endings at some points you simply don't know what reality is anymore.\n\nThe music is very beautiful and probably the best part of the game, combined with the story. The artwork is good as well, but not amazing-like.\n\nThe reason the title of this review is ''Feelings'', is because the stories really get to your feelings and this was the main reason I kept playing this game.\n\nFor example; there is an ending where you commit suicide, there is an ending in which you end up playing in a band and there even is a horror ending where everyone dies. You can simply choose not to play this last path, if you're not into horror.\n\nWhen you've finally completed the game in 100%, which means playing all endings (believe me, it's worth it), you can download several mods and DLC which is a nice extra. I think this adds up to around 30 hours of gameplay, or if you're a fast reader, perhaps a bit less.\n\nAnd the best part of it all, it's free! I would've paid money to play this game, if I knew it was this good. It's great to see there are still awesome free games like this available.\n\nAll in all it's a great visual novel game with beautiful music, very interresting and emotional stories and best of all, it's free. Don't hesitate in trying out this game, it's worth it.\n\n9.5/10","February 22","true","32.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Alright.\n\nBut first, lemme get something straight here. Everlasting Summer is a visual novel. It's focus isn't on gameplay, it's about the story. And Soviet Games has made a damn good one here.\n\nAnyway, lemme make a very basic outline of the plot (No spoilers).\n\nThe main character, Semyon, is... a guy. He's a person who believes he has no special qualities and hardly sees a point to life. Then, one day, when he gets onto a bus, he is transported to the Sovionok Pioneer Camp. Here, he meets various girls and boys as well as finding out more about 'life'.\n\nThe plot sounds rather unbelievable, but it explains itself very well, with the 'unlockable' endings later on in the game providing more of an insight into what's going on in the camp.\n\nAnyway, here are the main pros and cons.\n\nPros\n- A great, well-explained story with next to no plot holes (It might be a little head-scratching at first, however).\n- A beautiful, diverse cast each with distinct personalities.\n- Very well made background images and character sprites.\n- An AMAZING soundtrack.\n- Feels.\n- It's free.\n\nCons\n- A slightly confusing story opening (But like I mentioned, it sorts itself out shortly after).\n- Very specific actions are required to get certain endings (I had to look up a guide for one of them).\n- Some slight mess ups with the Russian to English translation. It is still perfectly readable however, and Soviet Games have said they are working on a revised translation.\n\nIn conclusion, Everlasting Summer is a great visual novel that will leave you in tears (Of both joy or sadness, depending on the ending). It's managed to give me many hours of fun so far and I expect that to happen for a while longer. A great read.\n\n9.5/10\n\n","December 1, 2014","true","27.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played the game normally once and ended up with a bad ending, made one small change near the end of the game and ended up with a good ending, and then made all of the opposite choices than my first playthrough (but still the same last choice) and got the same good ending. I may have to consult a walkthrough to get more achievements for this game, or keep clicking random buttons -- thank goodness for the built-in fast-forward feature that knows which options you have already chosen, and lets you speed past text you've already read, I am thankful for that.\n\nAll in all -- this game felt a little bit long towards the middle, but quickly got interesting. Seems I was only about 40 minutes from ending the game once I began to feel it was getting long-winded, so that's good. I suppose I'd say it's a decent length then. It took me a little over 4 hours to pass the first time, and about an hour when trying again thanks to the text-skipping (> button).\n\nThe in-game character graphics are alright, but the stills are a bit crudely drawn, in a kind of rushed sketch manner. It is this way with the H-scenes too, if you decide to download the patch (which you can find on the game's official website, just save it in the correct folder where the game is). So whether or not those are worth it are up to you. I just did so because I really like trying to pass games as much as I can before tiring of them, and the black screens where the stills are removed were annoying me a bit. Even so, I only saw one side-nipple throughout the entire game .. not sure why Steam keeps trying to censor these things ..\n\nAnyhoo, this game is a good way to kill a couple hours, and it's free. So if you're used to flash games and like mystery-based dating sims or even just .. people sims in general (it is really, really hard to actually get with anyone apparently, soo), this game is worth a read -- although I wish there was a 'meh' button, because I'm a bit of a jerk like that (and have not gotten a truly 'satisfying' ending yet -- good OR bad, hrmm).\n\nAlso, as far as I'm aware -- this game isn't really as sad as anyone is saying (unless you get the good ending? even so, it's more .. eh .. stoic or mysterious than sad, really). So if you're the type of person who prides themself on trying to find a really good tearjerker (I know I can be like that sometimes), perhaps this isn't your jam unless you're really sensitive. But I'd still say it's worth a playthrough for the bizarre twist about 2/3rds through.

I've heard people giving it a hard time because the graphic style is a bit different, and the setting is out of the ordinary.\n\nI found it to be refreshing, something new to add to the Genre itself.\n\nThe endings were interesting, but only three stood out above the others, and that was Miku, Harem, and Lena's endings.\n\nHad i worked with the group i would of suggested more endings like that of Lena's.\n\nI had a blast playing it and going through the gallery again, I can safely say i'll likely play through it and wrap it 100% again in the near future.\n\nThe mod community is quite active and my only nit picks about the game are fixed with that.\n\nCreative, imaginitive, only a few short comings and you can't beat the price (free).\n\nKnowing what i do now about the whole thing, i wish i had paid for it, as its definitely the best deal i've ever had on steam.\n\nMusic was perfect for the story, I think i vaguely remember crying for one of the endings like a little ♥♥♥♥♥. The characters were the best part and in the end i felt like i wished there was more... so I'm going to see if i can help with the community to make more for it.\n\nI'd say check out the various mods and if you enjoyed Alisa, check out "It not a dream" which i helped with the translation of!\n\nOh... Right... I rate it 10 Motherland's!\n\nPS. Because of this game I'm actually trying to learn Russian so i can be active in the workshop mods to translate some of them to english.

Sick to death of “waifu’s” being all “kawaii”? Are you ready for a different cultural experience that utilizes the distinct art style pioneered by the Japanese yet takes advantage of a different cultural setting? Well then I have good news for you! With “Everlasting Summer” you shall no longer be forcibly confined to the same banal dialogue consisting mostly of an endless stream of chans, kuns and samas; instead immerse yourself in the glory of the Soviet Union with the Communist simulator 2014!\n\nOkay, okay, I jest, but in all seriousness I’d kinda grown tired with the Japan-centric video game industry and the community. That’s a big reason why “Everlasting Summer,” comes as a breath of fresh air. The simple idea of a Young Pioneer camp is, at this point in time, a momento of a bygone era. Therefore, as an American bred on apple pie, baseball and the free market, the presentation, music and overall style of this game comes across as well…highly exotic. Not that I have any real love-lost with the former U.S.S.R. Yet, the uniforms, the Lenin references, the dialogue, district-centers, and the language all carry a flair and charm that’s just so unlike anything I grew up with. Did you know there was rock and roll in the Soviet Union? I certainly didn’t.\n\nThere’s a definite sense of nostalgia for the past here. Yet, at the same time it captures the attitudes of a generation transferring to a different way of life. I believe it was in Ulyanas story line that she suggests our main character that sees himself as a savior for the new generation, or something along those lines. Perhaps it says something about modern Russian society in the post-Soviet era. Most all of the endings have the main character exploring some exciting new career path, basically the visit to the past was the epiphany needed to discover what kind of person he wanted to be in the present.\n\nRussia, it can be said, is a nation founded on the idea of active resistance. Moscow is a city on open plain, a city that is not easily defensible; and as we say in social studies, “geography determines destiny.” Much of Russian history involves expansion, extending the borders to defend the capital. This of course leads to all sorts of interesting stereotypes about the Russian people. The only that exists in the modern American historical school, specifically based off of the studies in the Wisconsin school is that the Russians are highly xenophobic, expand their borders when they’re insecure and that their leaders are generally wary of anything beyond their control. I really feel like this story is a product of that environment. Perhaps, unconsciously the writers have portrayed some aspects of the modern mentality of the Russian people. Unsure, a bit insecure, yet ready to find a new identity, somewhere and somehow.\n\nThe game isn’t perfect of course. The dialogue is at time superfluous or grammatically incorrect, but this is to be expected when you have a game in translation like this. There are some plot holes and to my knowledge at least one story is left open ended. At least one doesn’t make sense to me, but again, crazy capitalist ‘Murican here.\n\nAll in all this is a good VN. Yes the appeal for most will be the girls (yeah there is actually romance in this game, who woulda thunk it right?), especially with…ahem, well with a certain mod installed, but for those that look for something that goes beyond the superficial nature of most modern VN’s, this one is definitely worth your time.\n7/10\n8/10 for the poker and the Miku ending (seriously what the heck was that?)\n","January 2","true","6.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

This game manages to merge and weave a wierd plot together, if you actually have the paitence to get through it all. It starts with a relatable protagonist whos never had any fun factors in his life, always sitting in behind a computer, not really getting anywhere living the hikikomori way, and one day finds himself in an 80's soviet camp, where the population consists of 90% teenage girls with perfect bodies.\n\nThe first thing that drew me in was the relatable protagonist, but as I began finishing my first character route, I really wanted to learn more, and it pulled me in. As you progress through each character line, something small gets revealed with each time you play. Little things which leave you clueless about the actual question of where you are, what are you doing here and why can't you leave. These questions actually leave you in the dark unitl you either finish Yulya and Harem's route which, depending on which one you take, determine the outcome of the games plot. I still haven't been able to put the puzzle together of how the two outcomes interconnect or what action made the leap from all the girls coming back into reality or just the one you choose but thats the mistery.\n\nMy God then theres the wierd attachments... the feels. As you finish each character route, the protagonist begins to have a relationship of sorts with them, and it felt wrong to completely reject the ones you've become close to for the next character route, especially with Lena considering she felt like Semyon's soul mate, and perhaphs Yulya imo. It's hard to describe how you experience this as Semyon, developing attachments with these characters then forgetting them and then having the bomb shell of remembering each one, realising how impractical it would be to be with any of them. This game makes you feel like you shouldn't have the feels, but you do anyways, maybe because after spending time on the game its hard not to.\n\nMoving on, this game does have a few negatives to it, but very minor ones like some of the english interface is missing or spelt wrong but thats easy to get past (and I think the 27/04/2015 patch has fixed it now). The biggest problem with this game, which isn't really a big one overall, is the way that, in order to finish the game you have to replay it like 6-7 times in order to get each path unlocked to get to Yulya's route, and im not gunna lie, some stages you're going to skip because you've read them like 5 times already, but you'll begin to pick up which parts are differnet with each route you take (NOTE: I wouldn't recommend skipping past any character specific events or any of Yulyas route as even though it may seem like you're going through another loop, Semyon actually begins to have a different approach to things).\n\nOverall, this game is brilliant considering it's free. It makes you feel, and actually has a very nice 'sci-fi' twist to it. Don't just play through once, make it through until the end, as, even though the game may wrap up nicely at the end of a character route (making you think thats the conclusion), make it all the way to understand the bigger picture... to a certain extent.","April 26, 2015","true","21.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Not only the 18+ versions but also the more "decent" ones. Lets start the review of this game shall we?\n\nIntroduction\nYou start the game playing as Semyon, a socialy akward guy who's only quality is reading on the internet.\nAfter being invited by an old friend from collage, he falls asleep in Bus 410 and wakes op in a typical Old Soviet Pioneers camp in the eighties. How did he get here. And why does everyone avoid his questions?\n\nCharacters\nThe characters are, well how do I put it, strange. At first they seem to be normal people, however do not talk about their past. Not only that, they avoid al possilble question related to time and space, and even start to get anoyed if you ask further. No explanation is given on who or what they are even after getting their good endings.\nAfter a lot of playthroughs you start to learn more and more and finaly the game reveals a bit of their purpose, though they're still shrouded in mysteries.\n\n\nThe drawings of the characterd are generally well done, at least in the normal conversations, in case of the action scenes the drawings seems to be a bit amateuristic or hastly drawn.\n\nThe Story\nThe story changes according to the character you choose to go out with. This afcourse is normal in Visual Novels.\nHowever what intriques me, is that not only the future changes with you choices, sometimes the present or even the past changes depending on which girl you choose. This only deepens the mysteries of this pioneer camp, and keeps you wondering what's going on.\nTo fully understand what is happening, you have to replay the game many times, unlock all the good endings, replay it again, and after the right choices, you get the answers you seek. This can be quite difficult, but there is an guide posted on the community page of you need some help.\n\nThough this game is not realy a creepy game, there is one route which made me shiver. I'm not gonna spoil the story but I'd like to advice people not to play this route at night.\n\nMusic\nThe music on sound effect are great and really put me in the mood to play this game.\nSometime they give you a serene feeling, sometime it lightens the mood, and sometimes is make you really scared.\nAnyway the music is great and never feels off.\n\nArt\nI talked a bit about the art in my character section, but there is more to it.\nThe backgrounds are really well drawn and gave me the feeling of watching to a painting (something even Semyon noticed). The only thing that sometimes disapointed me was the drawing of the characters in "Action" scenes.\n\nReplayability\nTo be honest, I don't think I can write much about. It is a visual novel, and visual novels do have the tendency to have low replayability because it takes you a while to read it. However there is the skip text function which make it doable.\nIt's quite tedicous to do, but since you need all the good endings to get the true ending of this game, you have a purpose to do so.\n\nScores\nCharacters: 6\nThe characters are not really that interesting and sometimes seem even fake. There are a few exceptions afcourse.\nThis seems to be the aim of this game and after completing to game, you start to understand why.\n\nStory: 9\n\nThe story is realy well done. It realy like the mystery part of it, and enjoyed it to the end. They do not lift up all the mysteries which let you, the player, interpretate it the way you think things are.\nI also liked that the main character has it's own route.\n\nMusic: 8\n\nI don't have to say a lot about the music. It's almost perfect, with one exeption: The heavy metal music in the bed ending credits. I liked it, but I'm not sure if it's appropiate for a game\n\nArt: 6\n\nThe backgrounds and scenes are beautifuly drawed. With exception from the characters in some points.\n\nReplayability: -\n\nI'm not going to judge this. As mentioned before it's realy hard to make a VN replayable.\n\nFinal score: 7,3\n\nIf you do not mind the sometimes bad character art and strange personality I'd really like to recommend this game.\nIf you do mind, well this game is free to play so why don't give it a try? You may like it beter than you originaly thought.\n\nPatience is key in playing visual novels, and this VN realy wants you to show that patience. However your patience will be rewarded after seeing the true ending, most things will be explained to you.","December 9, 2014","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Very well character developement; each character that you will come across will have a certain tone about that makes them unique. The character that you play as isn't a type of character that you may wish for him to be, but things that may come out of his mouth may be based on the choices that you have recently made, acting as a person you might actually be but not quite notice it. Although, the game did have a few images taken out of the game, I recommend putting them in the game (thanks to the help of some fourms) to get into the whole feeling of connecting with another character.

The various romance options have for the most part unique and interesting personalities. Unlike many of its contemporaries, its difficult to pidgeonhole any of the characters into a particular trope (though some do come close,) and the characters feel three dimensional and fairly dynamic. I feel like the inclusion of the secret endings a bit... anachronistic and not fitting with the mood, but by the time you go for all the endings in this game, you'll be invested enough in the story of everyone attending the camp, including the main character.\n\nOverall though, well written, the characters are memorable, and its long enough to let the story breathe and short enough to not make it feel like a slog to get the endings, which add pieces to the story at large.\n\nOnce again, completely free of charge with modders and talented, devoted devs adding new content.

I actually wanted to try it and started with this one because it costs not a single dollar and the reviews were pretty good.\nThe first hour might have lost me but I stayed and it drew me somehow into its world (get it? because the protagonist also gets into another "world").\nI liked the characters and the overall sound (ambient and music). Since I knew, there would be several endings I really started working hard for  one I liked most. It actually worked out pretty well for some time. I mean the character at some points is a bit dumb with his decisions but most decisions I actually did myself got me closer to my goal....you know...getting that one girl you like best.\nNow at the end I'm a bit surprised and heartbroken.....As you might have figured out, I did not really get the ending which I really wanted. All my work was for nothing. And I really like, that this depresses me. This vn gets to my nerves and actually makes me regret some decisions.\nNot many games have touched my heart as much recently nor have other stories in movies or books ever done so.\n\nSo about the visual novel itself. You cannot really argue about since the price it is free to play.\nI guess it was part of a freetime project and most likely very few developers.\nHowever, there are some things to point out:\nFirst of all I already mentioned the very decent sound. There was nothing too special but it always fits the situation.\nThe backgrounds are well drawn and are somehow in contrast to the characters. I did not really have problems with that but it definitly gave me a bad first impression since they might be the weakest part of the game.\nAlso having minor translation problems but meals and people are explained so you don't have to google words you might not know.\n\nWhat else is there left to say? I'm eager to get my ending of desire and also trying out other visual novels thanks to Everlasting Summer.\nOf course, it's not really a game, but a nice story with good accent on the characters and as for me those were very welld spent 8 hours. They probably should make a remake with polished graphics and sell it.....I would buy it then.","January 22, 2015","true","26.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Not only the 18+ versions but also the more "decent" ones. Lets start the review of this game shall we?\n\nIntroduction\nYou start the game playing as Semyon, a socialy akward guy who's only quality is reading on the internet.\nAfter being invited by an old friend from collage, he falls asleep in Bus 410 and wakes op in a typical Old Soviet Pioneers camp in the eighties. How did he get here. And why does everyone avoid his questions?\n\nCharacters\nThe characters are, well how do I put it, strange. At first they seem to be normal people, however do not talk about their past. Not only that, they avoid al possilble question related to time and space, and even start to get anoyed if you ask further. No explanation is given on who or what they are even after getting their good endings.\nAfter a lot of playthroughs you start to learn more and more and finaly the game reveals a bit of their purpose, though they're still shrouded in mysteries.\n\n\nThe drawings of the characterd are generally well done, at least in the normal conversations, in case of the action scenes the drawings seems to be a bit amateuristic or hastly drawn.\n\nThe Story\nThe story changes according to the character you choose to go out with. This afcourse is normal in Visual Novels.\nHowever what intriques me, is that not only the future changes with you choices, sometimes the present or even the past changes depending on which girl you choose. This only deepens the mysteries of this pioneer camp, and keeps you wondering what's going on.\nTo fully understand what is happening, you have to replay the game many times, unlock all the good endings, replay it again, and after the right choices, you get the answers you seek. This can be quite difficult, but there is an guide posted on the community page of you need some help.\n\nThough this game is not realy a creepy game, there is one route which made me shiver. I'm not gonna spoil the story but I'd like to advice people not to play this route at night.\n\nMusic\nThe music on sound effect are great and really put me in the mood to play this game.\nSometime they give you a serene feeling, sometime it lightens the mood, and sometimes is make you really scared.\nAnyway the music is great and never feels off.\n\nArt\nI talked a bit about the art in my character section, but there is more to it.\nThe backgrounds are really well drawn and gave me the feeling of watching to a painting (something even Semyon noticed). The only thing that sometimes disapointed me was the drawing of the characters in "Action" scenes.\n\nReplayability\nTo be honest, I don't think I can write much about. It is a visual novel, and visual novels do have the tendency to have low replayability because it takes you a while to read it. However there is the skip text function which make it doable.\nIt's quite tedicous to do, but since you need all the good endings to get the true ending of this game, you have a purpose to do so.\n\nScores\nCharacters: 6\nThe characters are not really that interesting and sometimes seem even fake. There are a few exceptions afcourse.\nThis seems to be the aim of this game and after completing to game, you start to understand why.\n\nStory: 9\n\nThe story is realy well done. It realy like the mystery part of it, and enjoyed it to the end. They do not lift up all the mysteries which let you, the player, interpretate it the way you think things are.\nI also liked that the main character has it's own route.\n\nMusic: 8\n\nI don't have to say a lot about the music. It's almost perfect, with one exeption: The heavy metal music in the bed ending credits. I liked it, but I'm not sure if it's appropiate for a game\n\nArt: 6\n\nThe backgrounds and scenes are beautifuly drawed. With exception from the characters in some points.\n\nReplayability: -\n\nI'm not going to judge this. As mentioned before it's realy hard to make a VN replayable.\n\nFinal score: 7,3\n\nIf you do not mind the sometimes bad character art and strange personality I'd really like to recommend this game.\nIf you do mind, well this game is free to play so why don't give it a try? You may like it beter than you originaly thought.\n\nPatience is key in playing visual novels, and this VN realy wants you to show that patience. However your patience will be rewarded after seeing the true ending, most things will be explained to you.","December 9, 2014","true","19.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game has beautiful atmosphere - music and backgrounds are its forte. The plot is good, but not with the choices and plot twists, but with short catchphrases, that makes tremble you heart, or makes you cry while rolling on the floor. Yes, it looks like some sort of book, but it is a book - a visual novel.\nAlso, I'm denying that there is bad character design. Often you can get a bad end just doing something innocent, but then realizing that was predictable wrong choice. This leads to breach in your relationship and then she... but this is a spoiler, sorry.\nI see here some reviews from gamers who played this just one time for the end. I say that after you get good ends with all girls (even Miku), you will get another one, more prettier in some aspects.

This one - does. It makes you care about what happens on the screen. And read hour after hour, going into the night... Immersion and story flow - it's about what good visual novel should be, and it's all here in place.\n\nThe game so much excites me that I'm feeling like becoming a fan and writing a hype review... Better don't, since the Everlasting Summer already got a lot of hype and it's share of fanboys. But even if I'd try to be unbiased, I wouldn't score the game less than "great". Certainly, it has it's downfalls - like too-pretentious plot, resulting in plot holes and anti-climax ending (I'm greatly disappointed in otherwise great Yulya route!) - but it keeps an overall good quality and, what is more important, keeps you ♥♥♥♥ing care.

But, while all these things hold true, it's been more than an entertaining experience for me, like games generally are. Everlasting Summer has adversely changed my philosophies on life. Each ending offeres a new perspective, or multiple, on so many different things, giving many aspects of life a new look for me. The protagonist is rather similar to me, or where I would generally view myself a few years from now. A boring, repetitive, hopeless grind of life. However, after playing through just all the "bad" endings and Miku's, I can feel myself taking a new look on existence in general and feel long-subdued emotions rising. If the depressing, bad endings have stirred this change in me, I can only imagine what the rest will do for me. Everlasting Summer is beyond being a great visual novel for me. It's offered me a new light on a lot of aspects of life.","February 25, 2015","true","22.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's set in a Russian pioneer camp called “Sovinok.” The main character you play as ends up there after falling asleep on a bus and somehow wakes up outside the camp.  The camp is set before the main character is even born so you can imagine how confused he is. The game is set over 7 days at the camp and in that 7 days you will get to know other pioneers at the camp. After you “beat” the game you will have an ending depending on the choices you made during the 7 days. The choices you make effect the other characters in the game and how they behave towards you. It’s a really fun visual novel and you should defiantly replay it to try to get different endings.","November 23, 2014","true","16.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Not just for the images, but because the stories are often intricately made and well written. Everlasting Summer is well written, translated quite well from Russian, and has some wonderful backgrounds and characters.\n\nThe story is complex, a bit confusing if you don't read it carefully. But it's a nice story, none the less. The music is fitting for the game, and relaxing enough to remind me of my own summer vacations. Even the backgrounds are well made, holding details that make it very fitting.\n\nYet it does have some faults. Not every scene matches the last, and it's obvious where different artist drew characters and scenes. But that's to be expected to some degree since this was made on a forum. The translations are good, but sometimes hinder the story since some of the sentences aren't "perfect" english.\n\nOverall, I highly suggest this to anyone wanting to try out a visual novel for the first time. The fact that it's free makes it easier to pick up and play. So my final score for it is : 4.5/5","December 29, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I has huge replayability, it's about 4-5 hours per ending, well at least for the two I've done so far. It was orignally released in Russian and the translation is a bit off here and there but nothing that you can't understand from what's going in the surrounding context.

Honestly, I preferred the latter except when it came to the tsundere overload route :D\nAnyway, this game has enough miku, tsundere, and panties to keep me happy :)\nUhhh.

Now the choices are pretty limited you can only pick from 4 girls there is 3 kinds of “secret routes” that you can go but 2 of them you have to unlock first the art is not great and it often changes quality in the scenes it did not really bother me but it was still noticeable a lot of the characters were also very boring and predictable to me I found myself enjoying only 2 of the 4 girl’s paths. I do like how if you have played through it once you can fast forward through the stuff you have already seen to make it faster to go down all the paths. I do have to say the game is very charming and peaceful the music is good and the dialogue is entertaining I just wish that “your” character was not so thick skulled sometimes. Its worth saying that there is nudity in the game *BUT* you have to download a file and put it in the game file because it was taken out and not every one has a “sex seen”. Overall its a very good Visual Novel that is *FREE* so I’d say go for it you have nothing to lose  The Final Review of Everlasting summer is a 7/10","December 5, 2014","true","17.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The English proof reading has be done but i do miss the odd Russian here and there. (there was this one scence where a girl cuaght my character peeping at her and then she went off screaming in Russian...)\n\nThe Art: meh/10  its stlyes are not consitant at all, this will turn many away and if you dont like what you see on the store page dont bother playing the game. im weird and i like all of the changing art stlyes given as it lets you see the characters differently,or in a worse light. Most will probably see is as bad is all cases and i will agree but its  free  ♥♥♥♥ man :D and if you really want story then dont let the art turn you off,\n\n(Correct below >.> Thanks) Music: 8/10 made by composer Sergei Eybog. Overall i liked everything the music was played at the right times and the ending and main menu soundtracks have really grown on me, whenever i hear them i will always thing of this game.\n\nRoutes : there is not one solid ending there is at least 6 goods and 6 bad with  the two special routes and they are really special in their own ways,one gives you the final piece of the puzzle and wraps everything up, if you slug through the game to get there you will be satisfised enough to look at this game and smile. Some routes are like, yeah right and it just was happy ever after while others will leave you wanting more.\n\nAlisa`s ending as the example was terrible but they did give another ending which was much better.\n\nAnd for the special ending with Schrodingers cat  yeah thats the one you want.\n\nMods?: Yes and this allows you creators to make the endings you want, if yor good enough or play through someone elses mod allowing you to see your characters in a different life.This feature really makes this game much more as you can keep reading even though the book is finished eh?? D:\n\nFun: i had losts of fun with this even with the miku route. For thoes who actually read this you will find yourself amused with everything this free game has to after.\n\nThings to note: If you do read the text rather than Tab or spam space your way through you will spend a very long time on this game , and me a not so fast reader spent 7 hours to win one route out of fourteenth.\n\nThere really is some good ♥♥♥♥ in here, from having a loli sleep on you like for three days to drunken sex with a tsundere after smashing yourself with vodka. theres a sense of exploration as every route is very unique and links together in one way or another. once finish one route you will find yourself wanting to go to the next and not being dissapointed in what you find.\n\nDont play this with family around , and if you downloaded the certian patch that floats around the guides you will get at least a dozen pics of *** for your personal plesure\n\nAbout the patch :o its not really that much pron  its  like 98% story then 2% pron  its really not that much or grahpic at all. Its even censored >.>  ergh this double censorship really suits a game about the communist era.\n\nplay on one Pc only :c i made the mistake to rely on the cloud... Also the sync with steam button just didnt work with me.\n\nHitler\n\nLots of Russian foods\n\nYour man character sometimes changes nationality\n\nCat girl in multiple dimensions\n\nRussian Miku. with a japanese mom.

With 13 possible endings, there are many endings you can get on your first try (except for two of them, which require you to get all good endings and the Miku end). However, the English translation is not grammactically correct in some places and a few misspellings here and there, it can still turn out to be a great story line that gives you the bond between the main character and the others. The soundtrack for this game just adds more emotion, and it is one of my favorite things in this game; next to the characters and the story.

Everlasting Summer is Awesome, marvelous, and shocking. Heres my first reason why... In my experience playing I've learned that, Well absolutly nothing, but I Will never regret getting this game, It really relates to how I as a person, feel in life. The second reason, The drawings... I can draw...but not as good as the stunning details.... (dissagree or agree this is my opinion). The final reason, You never really know whats actually going to happen. (well thats not always accurate, but you probably get my point) If you like suspence get this game. I applaud to whoever created this masterpeice. Thank-you for making my day brighter when I can't see the absolute future. This game has made me cry and when that happens? You either did something totally wrong....or something Amazing... When I finished my first slot on this game... I cried my eyes out....And Well, HECK YES! ...

That piqued my interest just like Katawa Shoujo did, which was made by members of 4  chan. In general, VN's not written/made by a japanese company should turn out quite interesting (not always good, but interesting nonetheless) as they aren't that much influenced by the japanese culture. Japanese Highschools, japanese character archetypes, you name it.\nThat's why Everlasting Summer offers a different experience for someone who has already read some Visual Novels, but at the same time it performs well as a Novel for a beginner.\n\nThe first story arcs revolve around the girls and the camp and how Semyon's relationship with the girls will change him as a person. The "secret" route (and to some extent the DLC) however focuses on the mysterious world Semyon landed in. This mix between romance and mystery is well done; The spacing and the writing is great, though the story is often pretty predictable...except for Miku's route, that was ride from the beginning to the end and the name of the achievement for this route fits perfectly: "What is this I don't even...". What I should mention though is, that while not a completely new idea, this mysterious world is pretty well "designed" and keeps the story really interesting; Especially that not everything will be explained about it and inviting the reader to make own assumptions.\nThe artwork sadly wavers from Triple-A quality to mediocre fanart, which sometimes damages the atmosphere as characters change the art-style from one scene to another. Good thing is that doesn't happen that often.\nThe soundtrack is pretty good, though there are better ones out there with tracks that stick in one's mind. But still, it does it's job.\nOne thing worth mentioning is the implementation of the workshop, which opens up the option for altermate endings, continuations or completely new story arcs. Right now, there aren't many english mods, but that should change in the future.\n\nOverall, I can only recommend this Visual Novel. The story and especially the world is darn interesting and I'm sure you won't be disappointed and/or bored by it.","February 14, 2015","true","25.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The story was engaging and I was up until 3AM trying to get to two of the endings. I recommend that you don't look at any of the guides until after you've unlocked at least one ending. I would recommend this at $15, but for free there's no reason not to try it. Thankfully, there is no hentai in this game (although you can download it off Soviet Games's website if that's your thing). It does however still contain a lot of adult situations, so avoid this visual novel if you are prudish. Also, this is a visual novel, so if you don't like reading then this isn't your thing.","February 14, 2015","true","27.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well and as the title says it's summer,.. (suprise surprise)\nWell and after arriving, you go and enjoy your new pioneers life in a camp with 90% girls and 10% boys.\nyeah that was one of the more or less bad pionts of the VN,(untill now i didn't play the Yulia route so correct me\nif i am wrong) Semyon never realy asks why he is back in the 80's.\nIt's like the situation: "Dad, why is the sky blue..?" Dad: "Because its blue my son." "Ok Dad I am fine with your answer."\nThats the only piont of the story for me to critizise.\nThe Rest of the story is yeah I would say a little bit over standart.\nAnd I mean with the "Disappearance of Shurik Suzumia" the story was complet.\n\nThe Visuals:\nOk haven't much to say about them.\nWell.I could critizise that the choosen sprites of the characters don't look that great as others  on the official website.\nBut I was fine with the choosen.\nAnd keep in mind that it is free2play VN so you can't complain.\n\nThe Sound:\nIn my opinion, the music of that visual novel is fitting. It's kind of Keep calm and well keep calm soundtrack\nwich is perfectly underlining the mood of the game. But also have to say, after maybe 6 hours I was sick of this soundtrack and replaced it with original pioneer and FDJ(like pioneers just from east germany)songs.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nWith the factors of Plot,Animation,Sound and Personal Enjoyment...wait it is not glass reflection.\n\nNo just kidding,all in all i think Everlasting Summer is a well written VN in finally in a diffrent location than Highschools or\nPrincess palaces.\nFor the Future I hope to see a bit more from soviet games and may be with a little bit better animations.\nWith better Visuals and Animation I think I would even pay 10$ for ES.\n","June 10, 2015","true","12.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Contrary to how the main character feel, your choices really make a difference, and you really are in control on how the story flow.\n\nAlso, even though the endings are all cathegorized as good and bad, there is really only a handful of bad ones, most of the "bad" ones are really only just "imperfect", lacking just a bit of something the good one have.\n\nThe story is engaging, and really, the later routes, the one you can unlock only when you have played a couple of times (or cleared all other routes) are really the greatest jewels of this game. Also, take a look at the workshop. Most of it is in Russian only, but the ones that are translated are really good, and even the original creators have put some there (and the one mod coming with the game is great too, exploring two characters that stayed way too much in the dark, IMHO)\n\nI don'T really believe in ratings, so I won't give one... But really, I love that game so much... I would have liked to play a bit more, and I might, when some time have passed.\n\nPS: If you liked the Good Alisa ending, I really recommend the official alternate ending, it's even better.

I'm not even sure how I ended up with it in my library to be honest. But one day I decided to load it up and the next thing I know, I was transported into the world of Sovionok. I made it through the first playthrough and the mystery of how I got there and what was happening was intriguing. I made it through Alisa's ending and then played through Alisa's good ending. Ok, a slight change of ending, I'll get through the rest of the endings quickly.\n\nI swapped then to Lena's ending and saw a completely different ending. Wow. Ok. So, what else is there? How does the bad ending differ for Lena? Woah, that took a turn. I was amazed at how much things change based on the storyline of the character I was following. I started to learn more about each person and why they acted the way they do in other storylines. And then, I did the Miku storyline. Without spoiling anything too much, I don't think I've felt that way in a very long time.\n\nFinally making it through the last two storylines, I look at my played time and it's at 15 hours. Wow. I've been reading and getting immersed in this novel for 15 hours. I think I'm addicted now. This game was amazing. Reading through, following characters, learning about them. The visuals are a plus, but get a bit repetitious over time. The music is amazing. You have the stereotypical anime girls with the usual personalities.\n\nI'm sad my time at Sovionok is over. I feel an emptiness, the same as when I finish a long and fulfilling book. I will say that if you hate reading, you will not like this game. But if you do, you'll find an amazing journey in Sovionok and be unable to put it down for a long time.","June 24, 2015","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is extremely interesting and fascinating, and you don't want to stop playing. The dialouge is great, the characters are dynamic, and overall it's a fun, laid back game. This is also a great game that can bring on emotions so brace yourself! The few problems are: 1) Grammatical errors occur now and then, 2) Sometimes the dialogue between characters can be back and forth in a weird and generally confusing manner, 3) some endings are kind of suprising in a negative way, due to the fact that a big build up may occur and the ending is subtle, and 4) It it heavily restricted on 18+ even though Valve censored the game and cut out all sexually explicit scenes.\nOverall I reccommend this to any 16+ year old who likes a story and plot to keep you hooked and a really fun time.\n\nPERSONAL IN DEPTH REVIEW: For a free game, this took 17+ hours to complete 100%. That in itself is amazing and worth the download. This game is so philisohpical and touching that it is my favorite visual novel so far. I'm not one for emotional games or anything but this had just the right amount in it and it was brilliant. Seriously, give this game a try you may be suprised on how sophisticated and deep the storyline is. You can get a brain freeze (the good kind, like eating a slurpee too fast) from playing this game.  Fantastic, wonderful, and captivating. Hope you have as much fun as I did playing it.","January 13, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everlasting Summer introduced me to the wonderful world of visual novels and since then, I have been devoting most of my time to visual novels. Interesting concept, great artwork(characters, background), beautiful music, multiple endings; it is a perfect VN to say the least.  The story is excellent, it feels like you are in the VN itself: living the life of a pioneer in a camp and hanging out with the girls. At the beginning, you will have a lot of questions as to what is happening and why but later on, you will start to accept the way things are and enjoy it, reluctant to leave this beautiful place. How wonderful it will be to be in Semyon's shoes. The story stuck with me for a few weeks and I have to say the authors did a pretty good job embedding the VN in my mind. There's a reason why it is titled "Everlasting Summer(Бесконечное лето)".\n\nConclusion: give it a try; you will love everything about it. Remember, there are multiple endings(14 to be exact), so the story will be different for each choice you make.

While I was waiting for the game to download I did notice it was Russian but that didn’t affect me at all since it’s in perfect English except for a few typos but that’s kind of inevitable, and you barely notice it. There are a few comments to some Russian culture in it but it is then explained for the non-Russians out there playing the game like yours truly.\n\nWhen I started playing the game the first thing I noticed was that the background art was unbelievably gorgeous. The pictures that were digitally painted of the winter and even in Semyons apartment all looked fantastic and spot-on for the environment they were portraying and this background work does stay throughout most of the game but more so in specific parts for some parts of certain routes later on such as in Miku / Masha’s route which honestly was done very effectively. Some of the early CG’s aren’t the best and certainly could have done a better job of but the art of the CG’s gets progressively better throughout the game like the dance CG’s are nicely done and the CG’s for the endings are gorgeous, real top-notch stuff. When I completed the first ending I was shocked realise the massive difference between the CG with Ulyana and Lena and then the ending CG I was looking at! Talking about the girls:\n\nThe girls in this game are all a great dose of hilarity, insanity, brilliant and downright loveable. I honestly thought there were two in specific that I wouldn’t like but lo and behold, I loved them in the end. I’ll talk about them in the order of the walkthrough.\n\nSlavya: She’s a sort of Yamato Nadeshiko but in Russia. She’s kind, helpful, hard-working and even seems to scold someone when she thinks they’re doing wrong. That is until Semyon catches her going to the forest late at night and alone… and he catches her skinny-dipping while she’s fully aware he’s watching her.\n\nLena: Lena was a character I thought I wouldn’t like. She starts as a complete shy wallflower who seems to like Semyon for little to no reason but then over her route her personality slowly changes until the climax in her and Alisa routes. She starts to become more doting on Semyon and more clingy until an argument between her and Alisa breaks out and she goes full Yandere. This was foreshadowed earlier when Semyon gets a mental imagine of Rena from Higurashi when seeing her for the first time.\n\nAlisa: Alisa is my best girl, no argument. I knew from the starts what her personality would be. She’s a rebellious pioneer, with an embarrassing nickname and a hair trigger temper. Can you say Tsundere much? She loves to play her electronic guitar and also loves Rock’n’roll and has serious hidden depths if you give her the chance to show them after her tsun side calms down a bit. Also she and Lena don’t particularly like each other, cuz Tsun and Yan’s have always worked so well together (!)\n\nUlyana: Another character I thought I’d hate. I expected such a bratty half-pint when I was on her route and wanted to leave her till last but, whoa boy, does this game love its hidden depths! She does start as a bratty half pint who’s a complete tomboy but then has something resembling a slap-slap-kiss relationship with Semyon especially when she plays pranks on him but after one of her pranks she asks him with all seriousness one day ‘Why do you hate me?’ and after this the relationship thing they have going is pretty cute and harmless and I do like that the game avoided any squick territory it could have easily driven into.\n\nMiku: Miku’s pretty much a complete airhead in the game seems to mainly have a motor mouth on her saying things with little to no connectivity. Halfway through her route though Masha happily comes out and turns the route and character on their heads, her and Slavya (now Sasha) have swapped personalities and turns out they were shooting a film but where this route goes is horribly dark and legit freaked me out.\n\nYulya: The only character I didn’t particularly care for, she mostly just seem spacy and a cloud cuckoo lander with a weird personality. That is the in and out of her character, her route itself was very intriguing but I just didn’t like the character.\n\nI thought the music and sound effects in this would be nothing special but I should have stopped being surprised at this point because it’s also really well done. Each tune that comes out serves a purpose and does what it sets out to do and what mood it wants to portray. It surprisingly has a lot of tunes in the music bank for this game and quite a few little background sounds to really add to the atmosphere.\n\nOverall I really did like the game and Semyon was a treat to follow, as a protagonist he’s interesting since he seems to be a NEET and an Otaku at the beginning but can slowly turn from this to anything else depending on which girl you follow.\nAlso I do have to say that this is a visual novel so there’s quite a bit of reading to set the scene and atmosphere of Semyons life at the beginning and that can really put people off but it’s not like the game has an hour of reading between each choice, on the contrary, there’s quite a lot of choices once you to the pioneer camp.\n\nI’d say just give it a shot, it’s free so what’s the worst that can happen from a free game.","July 10, 2015","true","8.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The path I took in my first playthrough was about 7-8 hours; despite being one of the bad endings, it still left me satisfied with the story (some of the endings are very... sad, and I don't reccomend doing Miku's route late at night o.O).  It has good visuals/graphics to go along with the story (and as of yet, no voice acting; in my oppinion it isn't even needed to enjoy the game).

This is the first review I have ever done, so bear with me.\n\nThe first thing I noticed while opening the game, was how well set out it was: the menu was intriguing and was easy to follow, while still being artistic and not sticking to normal "here are blocks that say start game and load, save etc."\nUpon starting a new game, I saw the artwork was quite well-done. The backgrounds were vivid, yet dark, as this was the feel it was trying to give off.\nCompared to many of the other Visual novels I have played, such as CLANNAD (and pretty much every other Visual novel by KEY) and Katawa Shoujo, The writing was... more Philosophical, more focused on him and what he was thinking. It was almost like listening to a non-maniacal monologue of the protagonist from Cross Channel, with much discussion on the meaning of existence, etc. Not that it bothered me, since it gives you an idea what kind of person the protagonist is.\nWhile I said the art was good, I did notice what many reviewers before me did: the sprites of the characters and the backgrounds clashed. the sprites were cartoonish, while the backgrounds were very realistic, like in Katawa Shoujo. However, at least in Katawa Shoujo said clashing was not easy to notice, here it was. I got used to it, eventually, and it was never really a problem after playing the visual novel for a few hours.\nThe next thing I would mention is the characters in the game. They seem underdeveloped, but I can see how it might be hard to fit in that much development of character in such a short time, and at least it wasn't to the point where you asked 'who is she again?'. Many of the epilogues don't really require the protagonist to know them all that well, but I won't spoil that for you.\nThe music. Was. AWESOME. I mean, it was like a micture of rock and metal in certain parts, while some of it was quiet and reflective piano parts. They never jarred the mood of the scenes, which is strange, because when I first heard the music, I just couldn't believe THAT was the kind of soundtrack they would choose for ANY visual novel. Those crazy Russians!\nThe plot? Well, it is hard to talk about that in too much detail without spoiling it, but if you have ever played or looked up the plot of Cross Channel... it had that kind of weirdness to it. Not exactly the same plot, but the presentation had similaries - shrouded in mystery and never really mattering until you stumble upon it. To make sure you get the most out of the plot, I would suggest doing the "Seymon" route AFTER all the other main routes, because it leads well into the last, and utterly confusing and heartwrenching, final route.\nAnd finally, I guess I could say what I think about the Visual novel as a whole. Honestly, it isn't the best one in the world. THere are spelling mistakes every once and a while (but I kinda let that slide, given it was originally in Russian), the characters aren't as developed as they could be, and the plot.... well, actually, the plot is what saves it (and the awesome music, of course). After completing the final route, I had the same empty feeling inside me as finishing any Nakige genre Visual novel: I reflected upon my life, thought how the story of this Pioneer camp and the (un)fortunate protagonist has impacted me as a whole. How has it impacted me? I still don't know, but I can feel it. Not to mention how much you wish Seymon found happiness, no matter who he ended up with.\nIf I had to mark this out of 10, I would say Everlasting Summer is an 8. It is definitely worth a read, and definitely has much to offer in the way of mind-screw and the heartnwrenching emptiness it leaves you with - just what people look for in this genre of Visual novels.\n\nEDIT: I would like to add that there is actually some replay value to this game. after completing all routes, I thought it would be a good idea to replay the game, to make sure I didn't miss anything. Since I knew the twists and main overarching plot, foreshadowing to said twists stood out more, where before it just seemed to be Seymon's sayings were just how he described his situations. They turn out to be more than that...","December 30, 2015","true","26.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The plot is extremely interesting and fascinating, and you don't want to stop playing. The dialouge is great, the characters are dynamic, and overall it's a fun, laid back game. This is also a great game that can bring on emotions so brace yourself! The few problems are: 1) Grammatical errors occur now and then, 2) Sometimes the dialogue between characters can be back and forth in a weird and generally confusing manner, 3) some endings are kind of suprising in a negative way, due to the fact that a big build up may occur and the ending is subtle, and 4) It it heavily restricted on 18+ even though Valve censored the game and cut out all sexually explicit scenes.\nOverall I reccommend this to any 16+ year old who likes a story and plot to keep you hooked and a really fun time.\n\nPERSONAL IN DEPTH REVIEW: For a free game, this took 17+ hours to complete 100%. That in itself is amazing and worth the download. This game is so philisohpical and touching that it is my favorite visual novel so far. I'm not one for emotional games or anything but this had just the right amount in it and it was brilliant. Seriously, give this game a try you may be suprised on how sophisticated and deep the storyline is. You can get a brain freeze (the good kind, like eating a slurpee too fast) from playing this game.

You may or may not get attached to some of the characters. I, personally, liked most of them quite a bit. I was never bored with the pioneers or staff. There is slight character development with some of the girls.\n\nWriting 9/10\n\nThe writing was well written. It kept me on the edge of my seat as well as in tears. The English is great by the way. They obviously didn't use Google Translate.\n\nSetting 8/10\n\nThe setting is interesting considering the situation the main character is in. I suppose it has to do with the developer, but nonetheless still interesting. Does it contribute to the story? Not really.\n\nMusic 9/10\n\nThe music, to me, is an important part of a visual novel. Most of the music is great for setting the mood. Gets the tears flowing, know what I'm sayin'?\n\nOverall Impression 8/10\n\nIt was good, but not the best. I would still recommend it. Don't let this be your first visual novel though.","July 30, 2015","true","27.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vampus/recommended/331470/","Vampus","Vampus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vampus/","1361 products in account","NOTE: Don't look at my game time as an indicator of actual game length. I often left the game running while doing other things. This review is based on one playthrough, the Alisa - Bad ending. No more information on that path will be given, to avoid spoilers.\n\nBefore I start this review, I'd like to point out that as at the time of my playthrough, the steam version of the game is censored. The game is designed to incorporate adult imagery. For that reason, and my otherwise enjoyment of adult imagery, I'd recommend googling the instructions on how to uncensor the game.\n\n---\n\nEverlasting Summer is a free to play Russian Visual Novel. You play as Semyon, an introverted loner. One winter's night, while riding on a bus in a busy metropolitan area, Semyon falls asleep. When he awakens, he finds he's been mysteriously transported to a remote youth camp and it's now mid-summer. Semyon and the reader are placed abruptly in this new environment and we're both left to ponder what has happened. The journey from this point paints a nice story. A little bit of mystery, a little coming of age. The game sold a nice image of camp life and had me wishing I'd given camp a shot. The story wasn't in any hurry to be told and felt a little lingery in places. This was despite a literal and figurative desire to try and uncover what happened to bring us here. We always seemed too busy "camping" to find out. And as abruptly as we're placed in this setting, so are we abruptly removed from it at the end (at least in the Alisa - Bad ending route), leaving us scratching our heads as to what had transpired.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice story, with some degree of decision making on the readers part. However, I did feel that we weren't given enough opportunity to make decisions, especially meaningful ones. This was also the feeling that resulted as we lingered too long and didn't peruse the mystery of our presence here. At the end of the day, I had to remind myself that I was, for the most part, a passenger to this story, not the pilot; this is a Visual Novel, not a RPG/Choose Your Own Adventure.\n\nThe game was originally written in Russian, but has since been translated into English. The translations don't appear to be professionally done, with a number of minor translation faults, especially in the latter parts of the game. These small faults don't take away from the game or lead to any confusion in with regards to the story, but I feel it should be pointed out regardless. If anything, the faults add in small part to the charm of the game. At times, when strict translations don't exist, such as for Russian products, dishes or concepts, the game presents a sidebar explaining the terms.\n\nThe visuals of this visual novel were a little hit and miss. The environment and setting art was quite pretty and quite effectively sold the setting of the camp. The characters however felt a little less complete. They often came across a little too repetitive and static. Part of the visuals of this style of visual novel should serve to attract and sell the reader on the characters; who we like, who we hate and who we wish to get with. As such, they should have a greater array of visuals with more character and expression. When it's the same pose and default faces every time, you don't get that. Another letdown was the "cut scenes”. They were a little too sketchish and a little less "beauty shot". They came across more like concept art rather than final hero piece.\n\nThe music of Everlasting Summer was quite beautiful. I often find the music of games to be annoying when I'm away from the game doing other things, or in cases like this game when there's little other sounds so you're hearing the same songs over and over again. This was not the case in Everlasting Summer. I have actually had gone back to the games website to listen to the soundtrack (available for free). There's the occasional foley sound effect in the game as well, but these are minor.\n\nOne downside of the game is the achievements. There are 13 different endings, each having an achievement linked to it. So to unlock all the achievements, you need to complete at least 13 playthroughs to unlock all the paths. This approach encourages researching the right decision combos rather than acquiring them organically.\n\nOverall, Everlasting Summer was quite an enjoyable (and free) Visual Novel. The “dating sim” aspect of the game may not appeal to all readers (it’s less pronounced than in some of its ilk) and the lack of definitive answers, or the lack of pursuit of them, may frustrate some people, but if you can get past that, you should enjoy this read.","December 9, 2015","true","57.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Contrary to how the main character feel, your choices really make a difference, and you really are in control on how the story flow.\n\nAlso, even though the endings are all cathegorized as good and bad, there is really only a handful of bad ones, most of the "bad" ones are really only just "imperfect", lacking just a bit of something the good one have.\n\nThe story is engaging, and really, the later routes, the one you can unlock only when you have played a couple of times (or cleared all other routes) are really the greatest jewels of this game. Also, take a look at the workshop. Most of it is in Russian only, but the ones that are translated are really good, and even the original creators have put some there (and the one mod coming with the game is great too, exploring two characters that stayed way too much in the dark, IMHO)\n\nI don'T really believe in ratings, so I won't give one...

The only con, if I had to choose one, is that the game is censored outside of itself and you have to download a patch for adult content.  As one of the achievements requires all pictures to be accessed, I'm not sure if you're able to complete it without the patch.  I'll have to update on that when I finish all story lines.  Otherwise, the character development is great, it's easy to navigate, and it continues to be entertaining every single time you play.

I absolutely love this game and was surprised over and over again by every playthrough's various plot twists and emotional roller coasters. This game is seriously worth a try and has hours of replayability, especially if you're into comleting every single part of a game. Every female character has a good and bad ending, as well as the character you play, which I thought was a nice touch. This game is very dating sim-ish but also has a cool mystery behind it that makes you question everything you've been through.","August 9, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The main character and I have some similarities, we both are somewhat anti-social, lazy, but most of all depressed and lonely. We both don't have special someone to lean on each other's shoulders and just cry. This game has a some influencing moral lessons that will affect you in someway. Everlasting Summer happened to be the first visual novel i've ever played.\n\nI don't happen to have any complaints about this game. Everything looks beautiful, the visuals, graphics, especially the girls. The game has a unique story unlike many other visual novels.\n\nBe prepared to experience the feels when you complete this game.\n\nThanks a lot, Soviet Games.

Even two of the storylines touched my heart.(It's not hard to find out which ones I mean :D )\nThe main storylines(of the four girls) can be found easily,if you do it mindful.Some tries(or a guide) are needed for the remaining ones.\nThe side stories were interesting too.Both of Winter Tale and Winter Miracle had a small twist - comparing to the main one.You should download them.\n\nThe graphics and the soundtracks are well made.Some of the graphics are beatiful,some of them are mediocre.\nI would advise you to download the hentai/adult content from the ofiicial page.Not because it's about perversion,but it can make some emotionally strong moments a bit deeper.(I won't say spoiler about which ones I mean.)\n\nThe only bad thing is the contents of the community.It's a Russian-made game,so it's logical that there are a lof of Russian-based posts.(In other words:most of the contents' language is Russian.No offense.)

Don't play if your not ready for Gut Wrenching Emotions. Both Happy and Sad. Well Written in Terms of Emotional Content.  BRILLANT Soundtrack that I still play on my IPhone today (which still brings up that gut wrenching pathos). Unbelievably FREE. Worth the $45 dollars that Japanese Visual Novel run for. Each character with distinct endearing personality. On the Con: Sometimes too much writting. The Protagonist is an typical Idiot who cant recognize his own emotions and is unable to say- "Hey Babe, I like you. Would you like to go out" till the end. But considering he is wrenched out of time and really a older man in a teenager's body, you cant be too hard on him.\nYou first playthrough should be without cheating or with walkthrough. Otherwise you'll miss the emotional impact. Ending up with a bad end first and then using the walkthrough to fix your mistakes it what makes it memorable. As in "IT CANT JUST END THIS WAY. NOOOOOO".

That being said, it did so surprisingly well. The premise of another time and another world is so overused in modern video games, books, and movies; whoop-de-doo, another protagonist find him/herself stuck in another world and is trying to get home. The difference between these stories and Everlasting Summer's is that, you forget that it's a fantasy, you forget this isn't real. Characters felt well-thought out and I found myself impressed and surprised at the amazing storytelling, but enough generalizations.\n\nPros:\n+The length: I consider myself a fast reader and I put 40+ hours into the game. If you're looking for something good to occupy your time with, this is it.\n+Well-rounded characters: the archetypes felt a little overdone, but well done all the same\n+The background art: beautifully done. I don't believe I have seen such detail in almost any other visual novel I've come across, let alone a free one.\n+The Premise: alright most people don't go deep into it, but hear me out. It was believable; obviously it's fantasy, but how many times have you fallen asleep or zoned out for a minute and had no idea where you were? I actually did enjoy the smooth, quick transition to the main story.\n+The Varied Endings: I won't tell any spoilers, but daaaaaaaaaang, I was not expecting some of those. Every piece of the story feels like a separate novel and that's what makes it work. The difference is, little incongruencies kept popping up that made you scratch your head and want to know what the heck was going on. But the mastery was the fact that it all came together in the end. Beautifully done.\n\nCons:\n- The length: If you're looking for full completion on all routes or all achievements quickly, don't even look at this.\n-The Main Character: there were times when I was left wondering what Semyon was possibly thinking and others when he was seemingly the most intelligent person in the camp. Just a little nitpicky with the consistencies.\n-The Choices: I love when you are able to "choose your own adventure." It really helps immerse the player in what's going on in the story, but some of the choices were a little ridiculous while some just seemed like they were thrown together for a last minute draft. Not a big deal, just a tad strange.\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nEverlasting Summer is an amazing story with real characters and a fantastic mix of plot lines. The writers did an amazing job of pulling the reader in and making them feel the characters. I almost feel guilty for not paying for it and you SHOULD feel guilty if you don't get it.","April 23","true","41.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It had a nice sort of sci-fi/mystery plot which I absolutely loved! The artwork is pretty good, in some areas it could use a bit of improvement but it also had its moments of greatness, too. In the end, I would actually pay real money for this game, and I'm surprised such an amazing game is available for free, so if you're a fan of visual novels/dating games like me, definitely get this!

I enjoyed most of the characters and their paths. The music was well picked. The multiple endings were numerous.\n\nWhen I look for a visual novel there are aspects I want.\n1. Choices throughout the game:\nthese don't need to be giant factors in the game that need to effect end game. Just enough to change how a scene plays out. Everlasting Summer score 9/10\n2. Multiple endings:\nI enjoy a replay value. I like a good ending and a bad ending and more important a vastly different ending. Score 9/10\n3. Animation and CG:\nI want things polished more than I want things to just exist in the game. Ideally I want pretty graphics and CG scenes (possibly interactive). Everlasting summer 6.5/10. This was the weakest point for the game and i'm surprised with such a small company and staff it wasn't worse. Even more, I was happy with what I got. I still have a full gallery and unique art that you wont find in the j visual novels.\n4. Music:\nThe music is extremely important and has to be appropriate. If you dont understand, try watching Star Wars footage without the music. If the music isn't appropriate, it kills the mood and the attachment to the world. 9/10 There's a large library of music listed. I just wish there was a little more unique and flushed music with Alisa's route.\n5. Story/Writing:\nIt's a visual novel. A novel can't be good without story and writting, simple as that. 8/10. I felt cheated with a route where I follow a voice and then zero explaination (I assumed I died?). A couple other hic ups here and there. The character can really just go off into a monolgue. The writing also had a lot of allusions to other works and pop culture which i enjoyed for the most part. It was also written well enough for me to play through every route. I can't say it's on the level of writing like Critical Point (the writers from UC gundam worked on that visual novel), but it's a great start.\n\nOverall 8/10. It was for the most part what I wanted. And that doesn't factor that this game was free. These ratings have no pulled punches as this was a professional quality of work. I look forward to the next one: Love, Money, Rock'n'Roll.\n","February 18","true","20.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This pretty much negates my only complaint about the game, so TLDR upfront: Play it. It's free. Do it right now.\n\nBefore I start listing how much I really enjoyed this game, I should point out the game's biggest flaw: It's translation. Almost every single line of dialog in the entire game has some sort of gramatical error or typo. It's almost as if they just copy-pasted the entire script into google translate. I had to re-read parts of the game multiple times to truely understand what was happening. It honestly makes the game feel like a chore to read.\n\nWith that said, the fact that I even kept playing the game is a testament to how well done it is. Without spoiling too much, it's a russian dating sim. This fact alone is interesting, dating sims not made in japan are quite rare. Unlike most dating sims I've played, however, the overarching story is a mystery and solving it is a central theme. The game has 14 endings: 6 good ends, 5 bad ends, 2 endings that could both be considered the "true" ending as they both give points that help paint in the big picture, and a free DLC story that also helps answer some questions. One of the worst endings in most dating sims, where the main character ends up with nobody, instead does a great job in getting the player hooked. It raises even more questions, and (at least in my case) makes you want to keep playing in order to find out what exactly is going on.\n\nI feel like I got extremely lucky in which endings I got my first and second playthrough, as I feel both of those endings were the most interesting prior to the true ends. On the topic of endings, you need to have gotten a good ending in order to get one of the last girl's ends, and you need to have gotten all of the good endings in order to get the "true" ends. This means that if you're not willing to go through the game multiple times (which is helped by the ability to skip text at a fairly fast speed) then you're probably not going to get full enjoyment.\n\nAnd onto my final point, the game's free. Completely free. Try it out, even if it turns out the game's not your cup of tea it didn't cost you a dime.","January 11, 2015","true","9.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Although I dont have 100% of the endings yet. Unfortunately the Auto-Read function doesnt work for me.

It has a unique storyline and although sometimes not so clear, as you play along and ponder upon the path and different endings, players will begin to understand more and more on the journey to redemption and value of life.\n\nPro:\n- Good storyline\n- Plenty of girls\n- A unique experience of learning some Russian cultures\n- Great background music which will makes you love them\n- Let you ponder back on your life (if you indulge yourself in the story)\n\nCons:\n- Arts a bit inconsistent (still I enjoy the style of drawing)\n- Mind boggling storyline (if players cannot think how they connect)\n- no Olga storyline (got letdown here T.T )\n\nWell, the cons aren't that great that you should take notice.

It took me about 3 hours of actually playing it to figure out what I'm supposed to do. But when you do find out the mechanics it's all uphill from there. This manga is so in depth, and most of the characters have 2 endings to find. I found the best part is trying to find out what the right choice is and then finding out that I screwed up at one point, but that's the fun you will have. I recommend this because the depth of the characters is so real, so lifelike, that I found myself trying to find out each choice and what effect it will have in the future. This is one of the games that uses the Butterfly Effect. If you don't know what that is, basically it's the theory that if you do one thing, another will happen. Basically think of it as choosing classes in high school. You can choose to be in, say, French with your friends and just goof around, or you can take a class like Spanish and actually learn something. And the fun of it is that if you choose one choice you won't know what happened if you chose the other. I really recommend this because of the fun you will have, the emotions you will feel, and the memories you will make.","December 25, 2015","true","46.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I feel that overall the translation from Russian to English could have used some more work. Things feel "worded" strange, and a lot of the subtle nuance you could get from the Russian version are lost in translation.\n\nThe story is pretty slow to start, but it really starts to pick up one third of the way through in my opinion. This was were I started to become invested in the story. My biggest disappointment would have to be the endings. While I have not gotten all of the endings first hand, I have seen them all and none of them felt like a decent closing act to the story. The majority of the endings (spoiler)  Deal with Multiverse/ Dimension jumping, time travel, Multiple personality stuff and whatever romance sub-plot you decide to follow, if any at all. (end spoiler) This sounds good in theory but the way the game concludes the different storys for me feels haphazard and thrown together. I guess another big thing now that I look back is that I could not relate to the playable protagonist at all. it seemed that almost every chance I had to make a choice my only options where something I would not want to do. This is not as big of a deal in games that have "fun" gameplay, but in a Visual Novel where story is everything it made it hard for me to enjoy.\n\nI guess even with all these things That I did not like, I can still recommend the game. its a decent Visual Novel with a compelling story, even if I feel that is does not execute the story appropriately. Everlasting Summer is free so go ahead and try it if it sounds interesting to you.","December 15, 2014","true","3.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This game has choice's and your choice's will make your ending and there are multiple endings. Some of the choice's are just stupid and you simply can not know what will happen with that choice and it can give you an ending that literally sucks.\n\nNevertheless, Everlasting Summer is one of the best if not The most best visual novels i have played.

Great pictures, great storylines(yes, storylines), great soundtrack, and many choices that await just around the corner. It's one of those games where choices REALLY matter and you have to make sure to pick the right ones. Although, there's no way of telling whether the choices you made were good or bad until the ending. Another thing: this game likes to stick to your mind. Like, really stick. You'll go to bed later on wondering what you could've done better and weeping with a broken heart because you got seperated from a character in the game which you felt something for, or you could have a smile on your face because you're with someone you really like and got the good end with them. Honestly, this game has made me feel things i've never felt before - e.g: Inspiration, saudade, love, depression... It's really touching. This game has taught me a few things, and I abide by them to this day. It's changed my perspective on things, how I act, what to do in situations, and I even managed to gain myself a girlfriend :D\n\nI highly recommend this to anyone and everyone.

Give it a try, it's free anyways. Though, I'd still pay for it if I had to.\n\nThe characters are quite standard. The main character is some guy that had nothing to do in life, tried several jobs but didn't work out, used to have friends, but now spends his life at his monitor, spamming F5.. Then some day, he suddenly wakes up at the gates of some weird-♥♥♥ summer camp. He gets introduced to everyone, but finds out, he might not be leaving any time soon. And, how/why did he even get there?\n\nThe game has a nice mystery element to it as he tries to find a way out. I still don't understand everything in the plot, but nothing is really over-the-top or very weird/overfantasized.\n\nThe music is really amazing, I loved most of the songs playing in the background. Fits in well with the scenes too.\n\nThe art is good. Nothing really much to comment on it.

It was so good that pretty much played it for 10 hours straight. I LOVE this game/ story, it's so good. The music is great, the story is great, and the art is great.\n\nThe only two real problem? Since it was originally made in Russian there are quite of bit of typos. However, with recent patches they are fixing that. Also, it is kind of disheartening to want to go path/ ending, and not realizing you have enough to get it at the end.\n\nDepite some problems I give it an 11/10; this makes me want to play more things like it in the future, after I 100% it. The FEELS are real, get ready for it if you try it out yourself. Y_Y\n\nI just wish it was more accessible instead of me always having to log into steam for it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevoltagehero/recommended/331470/","thevoltagehero","Tsundere Shark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevoltagehero/","158 products in account","I've played countless VNs before, some of those that are critically aclaimed, and those that are lesser known. I came across this one in particular, and recalled almost laughing at the fact that it was in my eyes, a random free VN. Expecting it be to rated poorly, the outstanding support got me to download it.\n\nNormally, I would have looked up a walkthrough for whichever character I liked best, and actually attempted this at first only to find out there is jack-all about this VN out there. Reddit has made mentions of it, although it's rarely upvoted, and vndb lacks anything besides the bare bones. TV Tropes doesn't mention it, and there is no "walkthrough" from what I've seen, which is really nice. I can honestly state this is the first VN I've read, that I managed to come across a bad end purely by myself. Not even disappointing, in the end.\n\nThe thing I didn't like about it is the length, I was a huge fan of Grisaia no Kajitsu's length, because even without the amount of choices, you really got a good feel for those characters, which is something you don't really have in Endless Summers. The MC mentions it a few times that "he barely knows anybody". I believe Katawa Shoujo (which I see everybody comparing this to) had the similar amount of route length, but it just SEEMED to be more there, than here, for whatever reason. A little bit of the story seems to be absent minded filler to get to the next part, which isn't too heavily used.\n\nFinally, to wrap things up, I didn't really have too much of an issue with the ways the characters looked. That may be due to I've seen some of the really "terrible" ones from earlier VNs, but overall they looked alright. Not stellar, not terrible. The background art and music easily took up more of the focus than the indivual character artwork did though.\n\nAll in all, if you are already into Visual Novels, I'd advise you to grab Endless Summers. It's not a very good one to introduce you to them though, but it never hurts to try and prove me wrong.","November 22, 2014","true","15.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I had no idea what to expect. Would it be fast, slow, interesting or just to look at cute girls? But this game, i guess its more of a story then game, is MIND BOGGLING. My hours spent are a little misleading, because I found an iPhone version and have been using that since i can travel with it, my hours are probably dawning on 25/30 at this point. I cant give anything away (that wouldnt be fun anyway), but i can say that once is not enough. You have to play through and test things (at least 4 times, that's what it took for me) to get the real story, and I mean the real , honest to god story. forget what other reviews say, about the artwork or the translation (which is glitchy but i could understand it fully, and the backrounds are gorgeous. The people, while simple, are also well done) the story behind this game is by far enough, to say the least. Just to re-itterate, i was ASTOUNDED by this games storyline. Ive found few other books that can compare. For a free game and my first attempt at this genre, I am honest to god stunned. Happy reading!","February 24, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
