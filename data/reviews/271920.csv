After all, it suffers from:\n- Very poor handling of the engine it chose.\n- Wildly inconsistent framerate.\n- Shaky and clunky control scheme.\n- Animations that are, quite frankly, ♥♥♥♥ poor.\n- Very, very few customization options for your island when it's all said and done.\n- Not to be harsh, but art deriction that has little to no interest in creating a unique style or being even pleasant to look at. Although that is hugely subjective.\n\nHowever, I'm going against my better judgement.\n- Firstly, it's free. The final game won't be, but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.\n- Secondly, it's a free creative outlet. You don't see these specific types of level editors everywhere, unless you want to learn how to program. It may be bare-bones, but considering the market isn't exactly brimming with 3D explorative level editors, I'll reluctantly give it a pass.\n- And the most important. Even though the final game (If I had to take an educated guess) will probably not be worth buying, it's a cool experiment. What's even cooler is being part of the experiment. Making levels that could be in a fully-partly functional retail game is kind of exhilierating. Especially seeing what other members of the community came up with. Though my levels are sure as hell not going to be featured in the final product, I still feel like I'm apart of something.\n\nSo if you're cheap and want a small-scale way to express some creativity (or just want to see what other people came up with) give this game a try. After all, all you have to lose is time.","April 29","true","1.4"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","25","39","5","0"

Seeing a free to use level design tool with workshop support AND the possibility of seeing your creation in the final game is pretty refreshing in my opinion. Sadly, my computer isn't capable of running it due to the fact that it renders the in game graphics, and reducing them does very little. However, that in no way is a fault on the game, but more a fault on me not having the proper hardware. Everything else about this editor as far as I've seen is pretty darn good, and can lead to a lot of possibilities. Just take a look at the Workshop for this editor and you can find pages and pages of beatiful looking environments just itching to be explored. I highly recommend this to any rookie level designer looking for something to start with.","May 5","true","0.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

The tools are very comprehensive, and some truly amazing sky-islands have already been made. I expect to see some high-quality stuff when the full game comes out.\n\nI don't actualy like it, though, do I recommend this sandbox? Well, it's simple: I know that many other people will enjoy this immensely. I prefer my beauty to either require struggle. The most "beautiful" game I ever played  was either Call of Juarez: Gunslinger (which can be pretty hard at points) or Subnautica (where the most beautiful parts were either fraught with danger, or very hard to reach in the first place). WA: Island Creator doesn't really do that. The maps are all good, some of them are just better, so I find it hard to enjoy the beauty of the game. There isn't any effort involved on my part. Imagine easting by having foor teleported into your stomach. Would eating still be fun? No, not realy. That's how I see it, at least. If you're the kind of person who went on all the field trips to art museums at school, this might be for you.","April 30","true","10.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

Personally, yes. I feel like it gives us as a community a good chance to experiment with the mechanics of the game and get a feel for what's to come.\n\nIs the client still very unfinished? Yes, there are still bugs and lots of things to be improved upon, but those are things that you will always have with clients similar to this one. Like all other beta/alpha games, the client has left much to be desired, but at the same time has given us a chance to have fun and learn.\n\nWith all of the feedback that will come from this, I feel like Bossa will be able to really improve the mechanics of the game based on what the community feels is necessary. After all, the people that will be playing the game should be the people that have a voice and suggestion as to what things should be added/removed from the game, right?\n\nOverall I like that Bossa has given us this opportunity, a learning experience, and I look forward to seeing where things go in the near future.\n","May 2","true","2.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

No. Not in its current state. It needs to be optimized. It needs improvement all around. Tools are clunky, unresponsive or over-responsive. Where is the water? Performance is terrible considering the poor level of detail you can get from this. Graphics are indeed lackluster. For this kind of performance hit, I'd expect to see something decent on my screen. Can't recommend this at the present. To make things worse, these guys are essentially releasing sub-par tools and asking the community to do the heavy lifting. If you want me to do any heavy lifting, you need to give me something worthy of the effort. I've used too many world-builders, terrain generators, and similar tools to find this program remotely acceptable. I want waterfalls pouring off the sides of my island.

I still however do not and will not recommend this tool.","April 28","false","2.5"," 7 of 48 people (15%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","15","7","48","4","5"

The aesthetic of the game has a nice simple but pleasing look to it. The assets, things like rocks or trees, are well modeled and easy to work with and the enviroment tools are simple and easy to use for pretty much anyone. The game also has a very nice relaxing background music to it that im liking.\nAlthough there are some flaws/tweaks that I would like to see fixed or more refined.\n\nFirstly is the UI. While it is easy to get used too, it would be nice to move the object editor to the asset pool options as a way to easily edit whatever you're going use before you put it down.\nSecondly is to have some better optimization added. While I was suprised to get this working at the level I did, seeing more options in the settings would be much apprectiated.\nThirldy is another settings options pertaining to the controls. Currently there is no option to either rebind your movement keys and as far as im aware there also wasn't even a way to see what keys do what (Please correct me if im wrong on this).\nAnd lastly, mostly personal options, but being able to customize your character a bit would be nice, as well as adding some more textures for the terrain, and also maybe particle effects like fire, water, or energy obs and what not.\n\nAll in all Worlds Adrift is definitly something to try out since it is currenlty free and system requirements are pretty low, so if this might seem to tickle your fancy then give it a download!","April 29","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lets us as players influence difference styles into the game. I hope to go deeper into detail with the islands which I am designing. I also wanted to get into map design. I used to use Hammer and make maps for the original Team Fortress for fun. This helps me get back into the gaming design "level creation". Stepping stone for me to get back into the groove. I am open to do more later. Considering making a TF2 map then more. But we will see.
