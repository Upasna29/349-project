It's a fun Android/iOS game. It is a HORRIBLE PC game. It crashes pretty much all the time at random. A dice roll can crash the game. Hitting 8 victory points can crash the game. Trading resources can crash the game. Anything at all can crash the game!\n\nThe campaign is unplayable because just trying to play certain levels crashes the game.\n\nI'm really serious about all these crashes. It's no joke. What is a joke is that I can run Tomb Raider, Bioshock Infinite, Metro Last Light, etc on max settings (or close enough), but I can't run a board game.\n\nIf the game was playable, it would probably be awesome. I have the Android game also that plays just fine. Playing as a video game eases all the resource management and whatnot from the board game. The game keeps track of everything for you.\n\nThe AI cheats hardcore also. I can the AI being intelligent and trying to stop the human player(s) from winning when victory is near, but you can be at 9/10 victory points with the AI at 3/10, and suddenly no one will ever roll numbers you can use again. The game replaces difficulty with implausible dice roll outcomes. The computer also constantly offers horrendous trades and won't accept fair ones. If you have one brick and no source of brick, they will routinely try to take your only brick in exchange for a sheep you already have 8 of. Robber rolls also seem to occur more frequently when the human player(s) are past the hand size limit. It isn't impossible to beat the AI. It's just frustrating to wait turn after turn after turn and see it rolls nothing but 3s and 5s because you don't have 3s or 5s.\n\nIf you like Catan, just get the mobile/tablet game. There's no online mutliplayer in any version of the game which is sad. There's a major trend in board games coming to PC/mobile that don't have mutliplayer. There is hot seat multiplayer which works fine. I play with a friend regularly on my Android device. It's good times.","December 10, 2013","false","14.0"," 93 of 97 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","93","97","0","1"

Save a game and then play a round.  Load the same save again and then watch as the same exact numbers are rolled.\n- Random crashes all the time.\n- Seemingly abandoned by developer.  No updates other then language localization in well over 1.5 years.\n- Tutorial is basically nonexistant.  They just throw you into a normal game.\n- Unintuitive User Interface.  No tooltips that popup to help you figure out what is what.\n- Game bugs out constantly and when you roll the dice, it actually gives you resources for a completely different number.\n- No online multiplayer, only hotseat.\n\nI can keep going with the negatives however there is no point.  I would simply avoid getting this game as the frustration of bugs/crashes is much higher then the fun value.\n\n","October 11, 2015","false","4.1"," 86 of 91 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","86","91","0","7"

Unfortunately, I was very disappointed.\n\nPros:\nVisually it looks good, or at least enough for a board game based on Catan.\n\nIt handles all the rules for you so you don't have to stop the game and engage in debates. Not that you would with this version anyway (more on that later), and it includes all the scenarios and a map editor (though I haven't tried that yet).\n\nCons:\nControls are lacking. The map can be squirrelly to navigate. If you're using a touch-screen it's nigh-impossible. When using my Windows 8 touchscreen laptop I kept flying off into some unknown corner of the map and tapping on buttons would cause other buttons to active. The interface isn't very intuitive and it doesn't have pop-up text to help with identification.\n\nBuggy. As others have pointed out, it's buggy and prone to crashing.\n\nNo multiplayer. This is probably the biggest negative. It's on Steam. Why not let you play with other players who own the game? I'm guessing they don't want competition to their own multiplayer subscription site, but then why even bother with this version in the first place?\n\nGraphics options. While the graphics look decent, the lack of resolution options is very disappointing.\n\nTL;DR: The game isn't worth the asking price. I picked it up on sale and don't completely regret it simply because I still fire it up every now and then just get a Catan fix when I can't round up a couple more players for the board game, but otherwise this one just sits in my library collecting virtual dust. The biggest disappointment is how close they are. If they fixed the bugs, tweaked the interface, and added multiplayer through Steam, it would instantly be a classic.","October 21, 2014","false","25.9"," 86 of 93 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","86","93","0","0"

Subsequent crashes (after reloading the game to your last save) are usually within 5 - 15 minutes. I have even tried to muddle through (since I am a serious Catan fan) and keep saving every few turns, but the game ALWAYS crashes and i'm just done.\n\nI cant believe I had to pay money for this.\n\nRunning in any compatibility mode does not help either and even after several updates, it continues to happen.

I would have liked to play more but the constant crashing and scripted dice rolls ruin the game.  The rolls seem to depend on the difficulty selected and how well the player is doing compared to the AI.  It is almost comical how 7's are rolled almost immediately after the player gathers 8, 9, or 10 resources.  That wouldn't be such a big issue if the AI traded competently, but they most certainly do not.\n\nRather than spending money on this electronic version I recommend you buy the traditional board game version.

Yes, it's Catan, our beloved board game and this is the only thing making me sit through this torture. Or pure madness, you choose.\n\nI've seen bad games, but this....\n\n1. Medium difficulty? How about everyone picking up on you! -  I've seen NPCs putting random roads just to block me off completely, without any use for them. I've seen them stealing resources only from me. I've seen them blocking only my resources. I've seen them trading only between themselves. I've seen them depleting resources I held when they had no access to them. Nothing can help you if you are ahead in points.\n\n2. The dice - if you want a fair game, this is not one. Someone here mentioned that the dice are the same after you load a safe. I can confim that. They are also mysteriosly "kind" to your opponents and their resources, that you are not connected to. Hey, you hold hexes with 8/6, so let's roll only 2s and 3s for the next 20 turns!\n\n3. The daily dose of crashes -  I've reached a point where it started to crash every 15 minutes, so pray if you forgot to save. Then there was that time when it crashed completely with the "running" bug. The bugs are numerous: Resources dissapearing or not being "drawn" properly; trades that you approve but somehow don't get anything; map zoom that doesn't show you the active map placement roads; development card crashes... I bet I am forgetting something.\n\n4. No online multiplayer...

If you could buy it for a dollar or two I would probably note it positive but I don't find it worth 15 euro.\n\nFirst, PC version alone:\nNo decent tutorial. You need to download instructions to the tabletop Catan or figure it out by trial and error. That's the first frustrating thing at the beginning.\nThe game can crash. It doesn't happen a lot but it is still possible, so it would be wise to save it as much as you can.\nWhen you want to build a road or a ship at the bottom of the map you might not be able to do it as the map is fixed there and the right bottom menu covers the map.\nHowever, changing view from computer graphics to a tabletop is a pretty nice thing. It can be helpful if you don't have a damn good graphics. There're also some options to choose from and it makes the game more dynamic.\n\nSecond, game mechanics:\nIf you don't like games based primarily on luck, you may not want to buy Catan. It's quite engrossing and needs some allocation of resources but so far I've found the very beginning the most strategic part in Catan. The rest is highly dependable on the dice throws. You may get resources or not. Neither the trade is the best part there. In the worst scenario you end up without resources needed and being robbed all the time by other players while you're trying to save some to build anything. Also, starting first you get more chances to use the best spot on the map. The next turn goes counterclockwise but still the first is the first.\nBasic game is quite boring. Nothing much happens there. I found Cities and Knights to be the most interesting map to play. However, it makes the game somehow easier if you manage to get to the dragons in the first turns (you just need to kill a couple of dragons to win the game).\n\nStill, it can be fun but I find it more like a facebook game than a hard strategical/tactical one. Just a nice way to kill some time. So, if you can find the game on sale, you can give it a go. I wouldn't pay for that much though.","April 13, 2015","false","9.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

That happens often with something as long and complex as the original Settlers of Catan, a famous table-top, turn-based, resource management strategy game.\nSadly, this version is utterly incapable of fulfilling that role.\n\nIf you bought this game to learn Catan, you are out of luck. There is no tutorial, the game just expects that you already know the roughly 30-page rule book in every detail by heart. And even if you do, good luck figuring out which elements of the dreadful user interface represent what action.\nThen there is the AI. The lack of online multiplayer can be forgiven if the computer plays decently. It doesn’t. It doesn’t even try to win, just gangs up on you to hinder you in every possible way. And even if you gain advantage, it magically starts rolling sevens to rob all your resources, essentially rendering you helpless.\n\nAdd in a dumb “storyline”, bad voice acting, dreadful visuals (why did it have to be in 3D in the first place?), and constant crashes to turn this into one of the worst board game adaptations of all time.

The game itself remains faithful, and uses both Seafarers and Cities & Knights expansions, though it does lack the ability to play Classic Catan. The AI, while using the guise of charming patricians and such, are rutheless and sharp - During initial placement, they have pinpoint precision with city placement, often leading to scenarios that leave you on the bottom of the totem pole, even on Easy mode.\n\nNow, while this would be tolerable to a seasoned Catan veteran, the game is plagued with bugs that force the game to crash to desktop, and as the game lacks an autosave feature, you end up wasting your time, even if you're having a very good run. And it does it for seemingly inoccuous tasks, such as placing the robbber/pirate.\n\nIf the game didn't have such glaring code flaws, then the I could recommend the game.

The Steam version offers the same experience just without wasting time on board setup. Two expansions are included – "Seafarers" and "Cities and Knights". You can play two campaigns, custom scenarios, online scenarios (downloadable community-made scenarios) or make your own maps. You can play single player or in hotseat up to 4 players.\n\nPROS:\n\n– Multiple maps and scenarios\n- Game editor\n- Still supported by game developers (kind of)\n- Takes only 1-2 hours per game\n\nCONS:\n- Not all rules are well explained in the tutorial (like what is dice stack mode and stack mode 5?)\n- From trade interface it is not always clear who is trading what and with whom; it is especially a problem for beginners and in hotseat mode, when you have to be very careful about the player's name splashing for a second before the resource exchange\n- Game crashes quite often and there are bugs here and there, although after the last update, it's much less of a problem than before\n- Achievements do not always work\n- AI is cheating. Here's why:\n1) Dice rolls are not random. According to the game's tutorial and game theory, the results should be evenly distributed from 2 to 12, however that is not the case. Often, if you have settled near 6 or 8, which are the most likely combinations, you don't get those results for multiple rounds. And, when you're few points away from victory, 7 starts to fall in every or every second throw, which means that you'll be discarding you're extra resources and AI characters will be throwing robber/pirate at you (again – you loose resources)\n2) AI character's are not playing to win themselves, they are playing to keep you from victory. I noticed that, in the beginning, the AI characters are never stealing from the human player, but if the human player is close to victory, they are stealing only from the human player, even if the other players have much more resources.\n\n\nSuggestions for developers:\n- Make dice throws random!\n- Include all the expansions\n- Include multiplayer\n\nMy rating:\nHotseat game with human players: 8.5/10\nScenario mode with AI players: 7/10\nCampaign: 6/10","January 3, 2015","true","33.6"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","12","19","3","0"

While I did enjoy this game for a while it has become a source of hair pulling, throat searing agony and stress as I freak out at the blatant crapware moves it makes.\n\nThe game will suddenly have huge runs of "luck" where it gets progress cards that steal what you have (progress card that will help you on your turn? Spy steals it. Oh you just got a commodity that will upgrade your cities? Yep trade monopoly to the rescue. Oh that vital Wood/Sheep you need for the settlement/city? Gone with Resource Monopoly or if you are slightly ahead somehow: Wedding. And so on. And not to mention the robber which almost never favors you and usually doesn't harrass your opponents enough to hinder them greatly.)\n\nCrashes occur when you are in the middle of winning a game and or when you try to play as other than "Red". For some reason the game gives a huge windows alert and crashes midkey stroke if you try to type in a name in any of the other player spots set as human. The crashes range from merely annoying to inconvenient to hair pullingly frustrating. And I wont get into the UI fails due to color.\n\nI don't know if the program was updated recently to start behaving like this but I find it reprehensible. And I am not talking about the "hard" mode that some people say is where the AI really cheats. Bad game is bad.\n\nUnless you are willing to put up with unbelievable coincidence (random chance my ♥♥♥) time and again I recommend avoiding this title, like the plague that it is. (Also really?

I've enjoyed the different board types and objectives, despite the AI behaving in a way that has started to make them a bit tedious.\n\nIf you consider how much I've played the game for the retail price, then the game is surprisingly worth the investment. However, I'd still recommend waiting for a good sale to minimize the risk of being locked down by crashes.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe game crashes *constantly*. On average I will experience 5-20 crashes per match which makes me rage a bit every time, but some people have had the game be completely unplayable due to the consistancy of crashes. I've been able to make due with regular saves, but I feel that I may have been lucky.\n\nNothing is "random". Everytime you load the game up after crashing you will walk through the exact change events that you experienced before, from AI decisions to dice rolls. While neither of these bother me particularly much, I did start to notice some extremely irritating patterns emerge from the AI after many hours of play. If you go into the lead, all AI characters will make it their sole mission to **** you over and despite dominating the game beforehand, they will completely shut you down. I've found the most success from trying to gain control of the board in ways that don't earn me victory points, but it's still quite annoying.\n\nThe graphics and general look of the game are quite poor and turned me off at first, but the game is really just par for the course when it comes to -most- board game adaptations.","October 23, 2015","true","29.4"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

In the last few months there have been some updates and those updates have made the game extremly frustrating to play.  The game will crash on a regular basis, graphics will suddenly stop woking and most recently, upon winning a game of catan the program will crash.\n\nI would highly recommend that catan lovers look elsewhere for the time being.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juxtavarious/recommended/239410/","Juxtavarious","Juxtavarious","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juxtavarious/","132 products in account","I am a long time fan of the Settlers of Catan series.  I've been looking for a good PC version so that I can play around without having to bust out the entire game board or even have to have others to play with.  Unfortunately, games like this only see mobile support for tablets and phones for some reason as though the PC is some kind of forgotten relic.  There are several different PC versions of Settlers that I have found, but there seem to be several common elements between them that make the games difficult to impossible to play.  This version is more towards the difficult end of the spectrum with its flaws.\n\nVISUAL: The game looks nice.  That's it, nice.  It's a PC version of a simple looking board game.  I've seen virtual chess games with more interesting depth to them than what we seem to get out of Catan for some reason.  Cities and Knights in particular is underwhelming, it's often difficult to tell what rank the available knights are or if they're activated or not which can greatly impact game play.  You can choose between a regular Catan board or a...well, let's call it what it is: a visually busy version.  The second form of the board has extra animations for the board to illustrate the tiles but the settlements and roads get lost in the mix.  The other negative in this column is the 'road building' zoom.  Whenever you want to build a road, the game slams your face into the board and does not allow you to overlook the board to make sure of where you are in regard to others.  It's a poor mechanic choice but I believe it can be turned off in the menu.\n\nThe in game menus are broken as well, if you are given the option to pick a free resource and it's not your turn, you can't see your hand to know what might benefit you most.  I often have a general idea of what I have but without knowing exactly what is in my hand it's an annoying mechanic that should be fixed.  I would also bring up that the game's aspect ratio is limited to the point of annoyance.  Unless you play it full screen, the menu options along the bottom may range from barely visible to unclickable which is a pain since Enter and Esc do not act as an accept and cancel feature as they do in most other computer programs I've encountered.\n\nAUDIO: The game, as far as I have heard, has one song.  Just one.  Not a loop, it has a clear beginning and end to it and it plays over and over.  If there are more than the one track, the songs are indestinguishable from one another.  Not a huge loss, I just turn the music off and put on somehting fitting of my own collection.\n\nThe sound effects in the game are simple but fitting for the actions.  I wish they had done something with voice acting to make the computer players feel more life like instead of the simplistic route of uninteresting portraits.  If I could at least switch out the portraits or add my own then I would have been happy with that too.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  As other reviews have no doubt mentioned, this game is unstable.  It crashes frequently.  The obvious workaround is to save often though I haven't had any problem with the game's autosave feature.  The few times it crashed for me I was able to simply reload and continue from the same turn.\n\nGetting back to what I mentioned at the beginning of this review with what all of the PC versions of Catan seem to have in common.  The AI cheats to create the illusion of difficulty.  This seems inescapable in this game for some reason.  If the human player gets close to winning, the die rolls suddenly favor the computer as well as all card draws.  In all of the games I have ever played of Catan, I have never seen any game take that sudden and blatant of a shift so that a player with three points can gain over a player with more than ten.  The computer players suddenly gang up on the human player, refusing trades, stacking the decks and loading the dice.  I've had a few games where the computer gets whatever cards they need in spades while I'm left with nothing.  The computer players will even choose to block and steal from the human player when it would be substancially more advantageous to attack each other.\n\nAnother element that is annoying to those of us who haven't memorized every last card in the game is when a computer player plays a card.  The name of the card is shown but not the effect and often not even who is being affected or how.  If you know the entire game by heart then you will be fine but this can be frustrating for anyone who is just learning the game and doesn't have a hard copy on hand to flip through to find out what just happened.\n\nThere is no online multi-player for this version, there is only a hotseat mode.  That suits me fine, but it may be a clinching feature for others.\n\nNow, why in the name of wood for sheep am I reccomending this game if there's so much to complain about?  Because it's the best version I've seen yet for PC.  Yes, the game is flawed and unstable, but it is the best PC port of this game I have found so far.  Its problems are tolerable which is saying a lot for a game like this.  Between the game having both Cities and Knights and Seafarers and supporting at least a hotseat multiplayer game, it's the best Catan for PC version I've ever seen.  If you don't like working with games that can be unstable at time then you probably won't enjoy this.  But if you are willing to suffer a little for a game like this then it's still fun.  I would wait for a good sale but I would definitely consider adding this to your library.","January 7, 2014","true","9.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I dislike the openings with the computer characters bantering, which you can't skip. I dislike the use of knights and the barbarians attacking every other turn.

It is riddled with errors\n\nI might add here that not everyone I have talked to has all these problems but many do. Just look at the forums.\n\nI love the board game and I was excited to play this but it simply doesn't work. 2 to 4 times per game the entire program crashes and I loose the entire game. The alternative is to save regularly, however the game disallowed you from saving over old files so I quickly developed a massive number of cluttering game slots. Not only this but the game crashes every time when I start up the campaign at scenario 4 which makes that completely unplayable.\n\nAdditionally, about 2 to 4 times per game, the display layers malfunction disallowing me from seeing what the trade offered to me is, what progress card I drew, or even the save menu. This problem can be fixed by exiting the game and restarting, however this is very difficult when I can't see the save menu. I have to guess blind and hope I saved it in a new file.\n\nNot only this, but the editor simply doesn't work. When I attempt to open it absolutely nothing happens.\n\nSuffice it to say, this game has great ideas and would be very fun, but it just doesn't work. The game is not as advertised, does not meet the standards you'd expect on steam, and is not ready to be earning money.

The story that goes along with it is also quite entertaining for consisting entirely of 2 minute interludes between new board setups. The different rule sets during the campaign are interesting and produce opportunities for using multiple strategies.\n\nThe game does crash frequently (which is ridiculous for such a simple game), but regular saving mitigates that frustration adequately. Also I suspect the random number generator used to control the dice rolls generates numbers in batches because the rolls after loading from a save because of a crash were consistent with the original rolls before the crash. This means that (as long as you save) the game doesn't change because of a crash, you just have to play the last couple hands over again with the same dice rolls. There is another quirk that isn't quite as easly overcome. The game zooms in on regions of the board when you execute certain actions (build a road or a ship) and doesn't let you zoom out or move the camera until after you complete your action.  Later in the campaign, one of the rule sets requires you to strip the dice roll number from an old area whenever you find a new area (essentially retire an old game space and replace it with the new location). The locked auto-zooming means you can only select areas to retire from those currently in view of the camera (even though the rules would allow you to select areas outside of the current camera view). I couldn't find a work around for this and was forced to just incorporate this quirk in my game plans. It never cost me a win but it is another example of poor programming. Lastely, the game would sometimes get ahead of itself, meaning that after an AI dice roll, the game would execute the next AI player's dice roll before conveying the actions the first AI player executed. The game usually caught back up with itself by the next dice roll though occationally it did crash. I would suggest saving anytime you see this behavior.\n\nUltimately, the game is old enough now that you can often find it on sale very cheap or as part of a bundle and the flaws in the software, while a damper, can be worked around enough, or are minor enough when they can't be worked around, that they didn't outweigh the fun and challenge of Catan (which is a wonderful physical board game as well that I would recommend w/o hesitation).","June 6, 2015","true","33.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The problem with the PC version is it keeps crashing...or as I like to think: rage quitting.

The trading system works brilliantly and the way you can navigate the map using "wsad" and "qe" is great. Sadly, they've tried to make characters of the ai players and I personally can't stand them. About two games in I muted them. Since then I've really enjoyed the games I've played...except when it crashes.\n\nOverall it's a great PC version of Catan for everyone with no mates...err...willing to play the boardgame.

I thought they were OK, but I'm not too picky about graphics for a board game.\nCons:\nTERRIBLE, CONFUSING, GAME-RUINING UI\nUseless manual\nTutorial is useless\nNo online multiplayer\nI got this in the Humble Tabletop Bundle, so it wasn't exactly money wasted, but I feel I must strongly advise you: DO NOT buy this game! It is simply the most poorly designed and confusing UI in a game that I have experienced in years.\n\nI love Catan (the board game), so I tried this game for the local multiplayer to show my family how the seafarers expansion worked.\n\nAll of us have played Catan for years, and have the building recipes memorized, but the UI on this app is so unnecessarily complicated that we were all completely confused and frustrated within the first few minutes of playing this game. The problems all started when we wanted to trade resources with each other. (For those not familiar with Catan, trading is  the foundational mechanic of the game. You can't really play the game without it.) This led to problems:\n\nThe trade dialogue was hard to find because the game just has lots of buttons with icons only and no help text or labels,\nOnce we found the trade button and opened the trade dialogue, it was extremely hard to understand. Again, there were lots of icons, and little to no help text of any kind. We tried opening the manual to figure it out, but the manual was useless because it basically just explained the rules of the board game, not how to use the UI. (Keep in mind that we have all been playing Catan for years, it wasn't a problem of not understanding the game rules.)\nOnce we figured out how to initialize a trade by fumbling and guesswork, the game said to pass the game to the next player (presumably) so he could view the trade and either counter, accept, or reject the offer. For the next player, the UI was even more confusing. The "Give/Want" seemed backwards, and there was an arrow pointing to another player that didn't initiate the trade. Again, there was no help text, and no manual explaining what the arrows and icons meant. The second player attempted to change the offer slightly by more fumbling and guessing how the UI worked, but because the UI was so confusing, he ended up getting the "Give/Want" parts backwards, offering to give away the thing that he wanted, and asking for the thing he wanted to trade. (He WANTED a wheat, and was willing to GIVE an ore, but he ended up making the offer of GIVING a wheat and ASKING for an ore.)\nWhen the trade offers came back to the player initiating the trade, the UI was a little more clear, but still confusing; all the problems mentioned above.\nEveryone was getting really frustrated at this point, so we quit the game and played Ticket to Ride instead. It's way better.\nSorry if that description was confusing, but that is exactly why I strongly discourage anyone from buying this game. The UI is confusing the the point of extreme frustration. The UI could have been so much simpler if they had just chosen to use virtual on-screen cards and added some more text rather than useless icons and misleading arrows. It might be OK for single player, but who plays a board game by themselves?\n\nSo, my recommendation for you is: DON'T buy this game. Buy the physical board game, it's wonderful; but avoid this piece of crap. If you want a good board game for the computer that actually makes sense, try the Ticket to Ride game here on Steam.","April 29, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, three main problems exist:\n\n1. This will crash. A lot. Sometimes this will be from just starting the game, sometimes this will be from trying to trade resources or perform simple tasks. Reloading will solve any problems, but this can be very annoying and happens on average at least once per game. EDIT: Most bugs seem to be tied to not letting animations for trading or resource gathering complete. Wait every single time until you're sure the animation completes before proceeding. Otherwise, the game can crash, you can cheat, or the game will become unplayable.\n\n2. AI is a little buggy and can sometimes just hoard upwards of 30 resources when spending virtually any would win them the game. This happens about every fourth or fifth game. The AI is beatable, despite what some others claim.\n\n3. If you're new to Catan, I would recommend skipping the game's tutorials and reading about how a turn works online. The tutorials are in the help menu and are short, episodic, and do not have any line dividing the basic game from the expansions included. This will confuse new players unfamiliar with just the basic rules.\n\nOverall it's not terrible, but it could be better.

I thought they were OK, but I'm not too picky about graphics for a board game.\nCons:\nTERRIBLE, CONFUSING, GAME-RUINING UI\nUseless manual\nTutorial is useless\nNo online multiplayer\nI got this in the Humble Tabletop Bundle, so it wasn't exactly money wasted, but I feel I must strongly advise you: DO NOT buy this game! It is simply the most poorly designed and confusing UI in a game that I have experienced in years.\n\nI love Catan (the board game), so I tried this game for the local multiplayer to show my family how the seafarers expansion worked.\n\nAll of us have played Catan for years, and have the building recipes memorized, but the UI on this app is so unnecessarily complicated that we were all completely confused and frustrated within the first few minutes of playing this game. The problems all started when we wanted to trade resources with each other. (For those not familiar with Catan, trading is  the foundational mechanic of the game. You can't really play the game without it.) This led to problems:\n\nThe trade dialogue was hard to find because the game just has lots of buttons with icons only and no help text or labels,\nOnce we found the trade button and opened the trade dialogue, it was extremely hard to understand. Again, there were lots of icons, and little to no help text of any kind. We tried opening the manual to figure it out, but the manual was useless because it basically just explained the rules of the board game, not how to use the UI. (Keep in mind that we have all been playing Catan for years, it wasn't a problem of not understanding the game rules.)\nOnce we figured out how to initialize a trade by fumbling and guesswork, the game said to pass the game to the next player (presumably) so he could view the trade and either counter, accept, or reject the offer. For the next player, the UI was even more confusing. The "Give/Want" seemed backwards, and there was an arrow pointing to another player that didn't initiate the trade. Again, there was no help text, and no manual explaining what the arrows and icons meant. The second player attempted to change the offer slightly by more fumbling and guessing how the UI worked, but because the UI was so confusing, he ended up getting the "Give/Want" parts backwards, offering to give away the thing that he wanted, and asking for the thing he wanted to trade. (He WANTED a wheat, and was willing to GIVE an ore, but he ended up making the offer of GIVING a wheat and ASKING for an ore.)\nWhen the trade offers came back to the player initiating the trade, the UI was a little more clear, but still confusing; all the problems mentioned above.\nEveryone was getting really frustrated at this point, so we quit the game and played Ticket to Ride instead. It's way better.\nSorry if that description was confusing, but that is exactly why I strongly discourage anyone from buying this game. The UI is confusing the the point of extreme frustration. The UI could have been so much simpler if they had just chosen to use virtual on-screen cards and added some more text rather than useless icons and misleading arrows. It might be OK for single player, but who plays a board game by themselves?\n\nSo, my recommendation for you is: DON'T buy this game. Buy the physical board game, it's wonderful; but avoid this piece of crap. If you want a good board game for the computer that actually makes sense, try the Ticket to Ride game here on Steam.","April 29, 2015","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The crashes are bad enough, but the complete contempt for the players showen by the developers is insulting. Not only does the AI cheat but there is no attempt whatsoever to hide the fact.

Then once the player is takes the lead the dice will continuously role numbers that suit the AI.\nYou can still win easily enough if you started out on the 'lucky' numbers, until you try the cities & knights expansion. No matter how many active knights, and how high you have leveld them if the barbarians win an attack the game will penalise the player. Constantly reducing my cities to settlements while one of the AI players with no knight at all is ignored.

Also all dices roll have been confirm are scripted on the campaign mode. I have a few situations in normal mode that I must informed all of you about before you ever consider playing this game.\n\n(All situations are in normal mode)\nSituation 1: 3 comps and me playing on a map, for 30 turns; dice of 2 and 12 have been roll about 15 turns each + what is so unfair that there are two comps just keep using those resources on getting the development cards. So after 30 turns those two comps have about 20 development cards each. If that is not BS, then guess what they will use them to? They will use them just on you! So every turns they just throw a knight card out and take your resources that way.\n\nSituation 2: when comes to trade, after they will steal your resource and they will try to trade that back to you regardless how many times you rejected them.\n\nAlso this game got no multiplayer, I bet this decision was make by the creator since he never like people playing his game without buying the boardgames itself. He should feel lucky that alot of people got such huge addiction to this game otherwise this game should be off the shelves from many stores by now.","April 23","false","18.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has been running great.  It has beautiful 3D animations but you can also play in traditional 2D format if you prefer (maybe this will help with some people's crashes?)  Yes the AI may gang up on you but only if you are in the lead.  They tend to attack the winning player which is to be expected in Catan.  Overall I'm very happy with this purchase that I can pull up and play Catan any time I want without having to wait for others.  My only issue is that I wish the tutorial for cities and knights was more helpful but you can read the rules on your own as you play and figure it out.  10/10","April 17","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It hasn't crashed on me like many of the other reviewers state, but I did find the AI very difficult to beat even on easy mode. It's just, just about earned a recommendation from me but in my opinion, Catan is best played using the board game version with a few friends. 6/10.","May 13","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EVER.\n\n~game play is slow as [random expletive]\n~insultingly annoying ingame personalities\n~confusing icons, even when you know what they mean\n~unintuitive play, including useless 'help' popups/buttons\n~repetitive, annoying AI interactions, EVERY turn, complete with slow visual movements (rather than, for example, a short text summary and/or a "don't offer me trades" button)\n\nI really, really like the board game irl.  Like, REALLY like it.  This game... my total of 2.4 hours on record does not include a completed game.  Why?  UI is lousy.  AI is cooperative (with itself as different players).  Game speed is ssslllooowww.\n\nFor $17?  No.  On sale?  NO.  Ever, for any reason?  NO!\n\nI wanted to like this game, and tried twice to play a full game through... but it's just badly translated from the board game, and deserves better - and if you're a player who likes the board game, so do you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pancoleon/recommended/239410/","Pancoleon","Pancoleon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pancoleon/","415 products in account","I picked this game up due to the fun I've had playing Catan with friends and, perhaps more importantly for this, the hours upon hours I spent "Catan - Die Erste Insel", which was released around 15 years ago. The nostalgia to the game wasn't hindered by the fact that (like with every other Catan game I've played) the AI characters are literally the same as those from the older games.\n\nI loaded up this game, just to find there to be two options for the board: "Pretty but horrible to read" and "With this view, you might as well play the board game". As such, it's either painful to read or ugly and I expected better considering that the now 15 year old game still looks rather good and rather pretty close up due to the fact that when you zoomed in on towns/cities, roads and tiles bordering towns had people walking around and working. In terms of UI layout, I personally found it uncomfortable to use and annoying.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's doing Catan properly, though the AI has a tendency of only trying to hurt you rather than playing to win. Then again, it's not like the old game failed at having functional AI and a playable base game. With the only difference between the two being the Cities & Knights expansion.\n\nAs such, the reason why I have such a low playtime on this is because with the short amount of playtime I had, I decided that it would be a better use of my time to find my old copy of "Catan - Die Erste Insel" and play that instead as it still holds up after the 15 years it has been out for.\n\nAs such, don't bother with this and if you can understand some German, get an older version instead.","May 19","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However if you've never played the board game, I would not wish this on anyone as their first exposure.  The graphics are terrible (even in 2D which I prefer), and the game is buggy at best.  So clunky to play this, but again, it's only for hardcore Catan players  that would want some vs. CPU practice in between matches with real people on the board game.","May 26","false","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Awhile ago now. I have played the board game and I loved the game. Sooooo.....thought I'd try the online vesion.... :-( I didn't read the reviews as I was a little impatient to play one of my favourite board games.\nAnd yes......what a crash to see that there is no multiplayer access.\nI also agree with all of the other comments about how badly managed the production of this game has been. So many crashes. A totally unfair system. Yes you can get ahead by a loong margin. But then you hit a brick wall and watch the AI catch up. How many times is it possible to roll a 7 for crying out loud!? Five turns in a row?? Comon.\nAnd then the Ai throws down all of those cards where they steal ALL of your resources and your cards of interest. Love seeing this happen.\nBut mostly what pisses me off is the lack of options for the game. You can't select skip all of the stupid bloody dialog. You have to click for every-bloody-action.  It drives you mad. :-) I mean, how many times do you need to be told you picked up a card. Or the card YOU chose will do THIS action. Aahh...yeah...thats why I picked it. I know.\n\nThis could have been a great game had it the options and multiplayer. But it doesn't. And yes, I feel sad for me too for buying it.\n\nI won't do this agin. I promise. Ok. F*&k, F#%k,  S#!T. Dammit to hell.\n\n","June 3","false","139.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
