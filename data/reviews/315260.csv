The environment is situated in an enormous cargo ship transporting biospheres for planetary colonization.\n\nThere are some good things about the game; the science fiction environment and back story created are interesting. Graphically the game looks good and feels convincing. Also, the controls are quite fluid and the game operates smoothly (I loved being able to rotate the map with the mouse scroll wheel). No bugs or crashing to be found; overall, I found no technical reasons to dislike this game.\n\nI played the game for 8.7 hours and finished 2 quests. To finish this game 100% one must visit 15 biospheres; all that time and I only fully explored biospheres A and B. I have a hard time with games that are too fast paced, but even for me this game is too slow. One would need to put in about 50-60 hours which is too long for a game that doesn't have much variety.\n\nThe maps are large but feel quite empty. There are too few scripted events, no special spots, or interesting extras, just hundreds of monsters to slay and a lot of space station objects that have no interactivity. To be blunt, after a few hours this game gets boring.\n\nDespite the very reasonable price of this game is not recommended since they forgot to make it fun, This is not a bad game, but it is boring due to the lack of variety.","August 11, 2014","false","8.7"," 138 of 176 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","138","176","0","10"

And now I have time to enjoy the game again, on Steam! And initially on Steam (as of 2014-08-05) the game was even free so it won't hurt to try this game anyway, especially if you enjoy diablo-like hack & slash action rpgs!\n\nEDIT: Oh, and try not to set the expectations too high either - I didn't had them high back then either. The game is old by today's standards and if you look at credits, the game was made only by a bunch of people. I also might be wrong, but I have a feeling that the English version on Steam is lacking (I can swear there was an intro in the version I played, and I played the original Polish version of the game), but I might be wrong o.o\n\nEDIT2: After doing some investigation it seems that I was right about the cut content - the original game had both the intro (which is explaining some of the backstory so you actually have an idea what happened on the ship you are), and had Polish voiceovers that probably never got translated to English. Also, unfortunately, the Polish version is not available here on Steam at all and so are the files, which explains the low size of the game,","August 5, 2014","true","10.3"," 115 of 153 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","115","153","0","2"

I am thumbing it down because the majority of my friends reading this review probably wouldn’t want to waste time with it.\n-Quick Review-\nSpace Hack is a very old looking Diablo throw back, “Sci-fi, RPG/Action” game. This game simply has the feeling of an “old game”, mostly because of its inspiration from Diablo. This game was released in 2005, so do keep in mind that, that reflects on the controls and the graphics.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Basically you are humanity’s old hope for survival, you start the game standing inside an enclave called a “biosphere”, it’s your job to help these other humans to be able to survive this strange new world. Naturally, in a sci-fi game the enemies you encounter are various form of Alien.\n\nGame Play: You can equip different weapons, and armor, as well as use various other types of items that are pictured up as loot from aliens you kill (or objects you find). This game also utilizes a questing system to help give you tasks and keep you active.\nSomething should be mentioned about the controls of this game. I have never adjusted the camera angle in a 3D game with my scroll wheel before, additionally there are several other key bindings that confused me, if you intend to try this game out, I highly suggest checking out the bindings BEFORE you jump into the game; Or else you’ll find yourself out of laser charges and franticly trying to find your inventory to equip a baseball bat to murder with.\n\nAchievements: There are no steam achievements for Space Hack.\n\nPrice: Space Hack is $0.99, what else is there to say? Usually I say wait for a sale, but this game is already purchasable by shaking down a little kid for his lunch money. No further comments.\n\nConclusion: This type of game will appeal to a very select “flavor” of gamer, again, the game was released in 2005, the graphics reflect that, I haven’t been able to figure out if the majority of the people who played the original Diablo like or dislike this game, it seems pretty much split even.\nTo be honest, most people on steam have tons of games in their steam library, most people will probably enjoy playing other games then this one, but if you’re feeling retro, and liked Diablo (or the dungeon crawler genre in general) this might be worth picking up.","January 12, 2015","false","1.3"," 66 of 95 people (69%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","69","66","95","7","0"

Pick them up or you'll spend the next few minutes struggling to stay alive. The guns in the game, like the first little "Magnetic Pistol", need to be recharged (like getting more ammo) from time to time, which is indicated by blue bar across the bottom display area.\n\nThe game is an old game that uses a bland "page" type dialogue for text which feels a bit "blah." But they tried to make it worth the read by giving you tidbits of back-story as you talk to each character.\nI do like the fact that the mouse wheel turns the camera, and this feature is necessary in order to survive. Some of the sounds are pretty generic and repetitive, but the game seems interesting enough. Worth a couple of bucks if you like these types of click and move simple RPG games, and don't mind a lot of clicking...your fingers will likely take a beating since you have to click each time you shoot. It's a bit too painful with all the clicking for my taste.","August 5, 2014","true","0.5"," 52 of 73 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","52","73","0","0"

It's a dated game for sure but it has a lot of issues with balance, gear, energy management and the actual element of a game being fun.\n\nWhen you first start the game, you're given a club (a melee weapon in the game with degradability). I read a review here saying there's other stuff on the floor but I didn't see anything, maybe they meant the monster drops. The problem here is (at least in Normal difficulty), that monsters chop you down very easily, you swing, they hit, you swing, they hit, rinse repeat. Eventually, you will either run of HP or your weapon will break. If a weapon breaks in this game, it is removed entirely from your inventory which is a bit harsh.\n\nLuckily, there's a free doctor at the base but running back and forth between him and to where you want to go is very tedious. You can get healing capsules but they cost about 150 cells (currency in the game) per one use, which is far too expensive as the payout from the first few areas is absymal. Monsters have a small chance to drop cells or random gear. I spent most of my income on repairs and purchasing one helmet. The prices are set way too high and this encourages grinding except this quickly becomes a chore in a game with uninspiring enemies and locale.\n\nGear-wise, the club is a good option but lacks speed so it leaves you open to a lot of hits. The bow is pretty redundant as there is no stand-and-shoot option and the range is laughable. So much so that once you're in range, you'll deal only a small amount of DPS - might as well keep the club.\n\nThe energy guns are a much better option but unfortunately, they rely on energy which is spent very quickly. I think I found an energy refill item but that was when I stopped playing, the game just got a bit too boring after that.\n\nStory-wise, there isn't really much to it. Wall of texts try to flesh out the characters but otherwise not a great deal to say here.\n\nA much better free game is Path of Exile, similar game mechanic but overall, just much better in every department.\n\nIt's very difficult to use a Yes or No conclusion to this review, especially for a game that cost nothing but an hour to check it out but if I had a chance to take that hour back, it'd be spent elsewhere.","August 9, 2014","false","1.0"," 47 of 75 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","47","75","0","6"

You remember that part in Diablo where you went two levels punching monsters with ranged attacks with your fists while finding almost no loot?  Me either.\n\nThe thing is it is faithful to most of the Diablo design, but not gameplay or fun.  The little bit I've been willing to play has demonstrated two of the key strongpoints of Diablo are missing here.\n\nFirst, gear.  Diablo is a game about gear and loot, and the same systems are here.  Except you don't start with weapons, and the ones you could buy are expensive.  As in, a simple club is worth more money than you will make in the first area.  You will find guns right off the bat, but they will have a limited use, that does not seem to recharge.  That is not a limit per gun, but rather that your energy doesn't recover any way I've found.\n\nSecond, in Diablo you could get swarmed.  You could die.  You could get in over your head.  But it wasn't difficult to try again, or retreat and try a different approach.  Right now I am at the first teleport going into the second area, and a brief exploration caused a huge army to park there.  I nearly die as soon as I enter the area.  There's no way around it.  And no weapons or decent armor because of the minimal loot and high prices.\n\nAnother irritant is the camera.  If you get too close to a wall, it causes the camera to move in odd ways.  Sometimes enemies can be obscured behind objects, so it is necessary to rotate the camera often just to be sure.\n\nThe thing is, whether or not this game will be good if I push through it, so far it is tedious.  I am getting hurt in fist fights with no easy way to heal except to return to the base.  I am literally doing hit and run attacks with my fists between the second area and the base.  Get three punches in, walk home to heal.  Over and over and over.  And that is not good design.  It doesn't bode well for the rest of the game.  I'm not saying it's hard.  I'm saying it's boring at this point.","August 6, 2014","false","0.8"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I wouldn't call it "a classic", but it's solid. Because it comes from Ye Olden Days , don't expect the flashiest of effects, or particularly novel gameplay.\n\nIf you're a fan of hack-n-slash, point-n-click, straightforward RPGs then Space Hack could well be the ticket. It's exactly what it says on the tin -- you're on a ship, in space, and you have to hack (or shoot) your way through all the levels. A generic storyline and a cast of basic NPCs with 2.5D personalities give you a bit of backstory; but this is the sort of game enjoyed by people who want a casual bug-hunt on a stranded ship drifting through the void.\n\nBy current standards, it's nothing special; but like I said it's a solid game. You hit things, and they make a satisfying "splat" noise. There are a few different weapon options, and just enough RPG factors to make you feel like you're following a "progression path". There are even some cool gadgets which stand in for "skills", and you can choose freely among them (assuming you have the right stats of course), so it's quite possible to replay the game a variety of different ways.\n\nThe only downsides which are real flaws within the game (as opposed to simply superceeded mechanics or tech) are the sometimes dodgy translation of the dialogue, and the fact that the levels can be confusing and annoying to clear. There's always that *one* bug you missed and have to explore the whole map to find...\n\nFor 99c, it's a worthwhile deal.","August 24, 2015","true","7.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

It's such a waste of time, and it is with out a doubt BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORING. I don't know how I can enunciate even further how boring this game is, but I will try, brace yourselves.\n\nFirst off it is obvious what this game is trying to be, Diablo in space, and I like that idea, but it just falls short (or falls off a cliff completly missing the target). So this game tries to be Diablo 2 which was released 4 years after the initial release date of Diablo 2, but it just gets everything WRONG.\n\nThe first thing this game gets way wrong is the loot system, or lack there of a loot system. There are barely any loot drops in this game, In diablo there were constant loot drops so you had enough money to repair equipment buy potions or buy items. In this game only money drops and its barely enough to repair equipment. (oh and if your equipment breaks its gone from your inventory so you can't even repair it, Ya good one.) selling something might as well be a joke since the vendors will barely give you anything. Yes the vendors do give you free healing an energy but WHY IS EVERYTHING SO OVERPRICED? AM I NOT THE ONLY FREAKING PERSON DOING ANYTHING ON THIS DAMN CAMP?! Well you know thats how all vendors are in any game, they could have Hells gate right on their door step and they would still want 2000 for the weapon to repel all evil.\n\nVendors, they have the Conviction of ♥♥♥♥ING Adamantium.\n\nSo anywho, there are no classes, your just Space Hack the ultimate badass of the galaxy that has no variety in his style what so ever. So there is no reason for you to replay this game, ONE HOUR AND YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE POWER OF SPACE HACK. Great give me another reason not to play this game.\n\nYour stamina is a joke, It recharges rediculously slow and it takes away stamina ludicrously fast. Yes in diablo you had stamina that went away and recharged but it seemed like it was enough and if you overexerted yourself you would have to wait just a little, it was fair.\n\nYour enemies do not respawn, Look if your going to be a hack and slash rpg you need alot of minions to kill in order to level to defeat the forces of evil, I'm still walking through the first area and Everythings dead already! I know I only played this game for a little bit but for close to an hour I should be a good level, Like in diablo I would be level 5 in about an hour or higher, guess what level I am for playing about 40 minutes. Go on guess, stop reading and guess.\n\n\n\n\nYa done guessing, cause to me its unbelieveable\n\nMy level was\n\n2\n\nLEVEL FREAKING 2. you know hacking away that long your gonna get bored and it has to seem like your getting some where and that you are getting stronger. Here it was getting boring cause I'm leveling up slowly, nothing is dropping, nothing special is dropping, and don't feel that what I'm battling is just as boring and tedious that looks like a smaller version of the Bugs from star ship troopers.\n\nOh yeah and if you do play this bore-fest you can put points into individual stats, but be warned there is an + to add in points but no - to take out a point to reconsider before finalizing your stats.\n\nYou have no special abilities, oh yeah there are items that contain special abilities but I still haven't gotten them. Further amplifiying the bordem of not feeling any accomplishments in this game, you (The developer) can't even give me some other way of killing my enemies. NOW I JUST FEEL LIKE THE GAURD RIGHT BY THE GATE!\n\nThe main Character, Space Hack, is  pretty much a cardboard cut out of anything, he doesn't seem to have any crazy gestures or do anything that is considered bad ♥♥♥, Seriously if there was at least a video of him saving a baby from an exploding pod and shooting at aliens without even looking at them, all the while smoking a cigar, THEN and only then could you convince me that we are playing a bad ♥♥♥. There are no other actions from him in this game that suggests he is, all we see is a mug shot of him with an eyepatch and assume he is a bad ♥♥♥. I can't take him as a badass because for all I know he lost his eye from slipping his spork on a salad and stabbing himself in the eye. He seriously could just be a normal security gaurd asked to do this mission and it wouldn't make this any different.\n\nThe environment is boring, the soundtrack is dull, the creatures are dull, The main character is generic, the leveling sucks, the creatures suck, and I'm pretty sure they used the same sound bites from diablo 2\n\nThis game was a waste of time, The only reason I continued to play a little longer was to do a review of it, Seriously 1 buck is too much to play something so boring.\n\nPlay Path of Exile, that is at least a free to play game. Or if you want to spend money Titan Quest, Torchlight 1 or 2.\nOr play Deathspank, That is a funny version of a badass and one of my favorite Diablo style games\n\nMy final Verdict: STAY AWAY from this game, it's boring and a waste of a dollar, My advice to a developer if your going to be a rip off, BE A GOOD RIP OFF. Go all the way at least it will be an entertaining game","August 27, 2014","false","0.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","0"

Never again.Space Hack is a sci-fi RPG/action, which was released in 2004. All players and even developers describe this game like Diablo-inspired gameplay mechanics clone.\nAll your walkthrough will consist of grinding alien monsters. All 40+ locations you will slaying hundreds of monsters. Sad thing is that your enemies differ from each others only in stats. With your way to "Mother" Module monsters become only fatter and hit harder. They have nothing something like special unique abilities. Just melee and ranged attack. Ranged attack can be one of four types. So all game you won't face any new creature, which has different fight mechanics you haven't seen in first 3-5 locations. I've completed this game on hard difficulty, cleared all locations. For 40+ locations I've met only 2 unique bosses.\nThere is no stash in this game. So all items you can't wear at current stats you need to carry in inventory.\nAt last locations when I tried to change locations with teleport game crashed a few times. Every biosphere had at least one location with  lightnings on my screen, I don't know - it was graphical bug or not, but it was disturbing. Steam version has no voice sound over dialogues and missions.\nSo if you are looking for interesting action rpg, better skip this game. Maybe Space Hack was good game for 2004. But in 2014 it was painful for me to complete this game. Yes, it has storyline, but you'll face 45 locations of grinding same monsters. Worth it?","September 13, 2014","false","36.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","8","11","2","2"

Better go buy Torchlight II.\n\nFirst of all i must say that i got this game in a bundle for free, not even with that i managed to like this game. I wanted to like it because, c'mon, is you vs lots of monster aliens to kill. But the flaws are just to much for me to even enjoy it.\n\nFirst, the curiosity is what makes you play the first levels. But after a while, you realize the game is just walk-kill, and is not even that rewarding, most of the time you will get items you can't even use, and most of your money will be spent in repairing. And when you got the money, there is actually not much to buy. There are not many weapons.\n\nThe mechanics of the technological weapons are not explained at all. And that reminds me, the interface is... not really good. You will be guessing what all those numbers and symbols on screen means in the first 40 minutes of play.\n\ni didn't get as far as 3 biospheres or whatever they are called, not a single boss. Pity.\n\nThe mouse interface is a pain too, sometimes you will be fighting to get a tiny pistol or med kit that was droped on the floor.  And that reminds me that if you are not carefull, you will be missing some items on the floor because they are hard to spot most of the time, i wish the had left the "alt" key as a toggle key.\n\nNo stashes, no place to keep things stored, no secrets or hidden places.\n\nStory is not good, if there is any.\n\nMusic goes with the mood of the game but is not good either. i belive there is only two background music pieces.\n\nAfter a while of playing it, you will be playing with some kind of strategy using run/walk, hiding behind objects to ambush the aliens coming for you, but after a while of doing it, it gets awfully boring.\n\nI know the developers put a lot of effort in this game, it can be noted, but is just a big "no" for me. The graphics are probably the best thing here. And for me, thats exactly the problem. It lacks good gameplay, good story, good music, even good ambient, i didn't feel inside a spaceship, neither a biodome.\n\nIf you don't give a damn about the things i mentioned, and just want good graphics (for 2005) and just go around maps killing everything at your path and destroying objects to complete your missions, feel free to play it. I strongly advice playing a demo, or looking at gameplays before buying it.\n\nIf you care about any of the details i mentioned, you won't be able to play this game a lot, is just plain boring and repetitive, no surprises, no misteries, just go around killing. Once again, if you played Diablo and you are looking for a similar experience, go for Torchlight II.","September 26, 2014","false","6.8"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","14","23","3","0"

It was just dug up and released back once again. Honestly, I didn't hope for better things from 'new realization', but screenshots were nostalgic and quite good, so I tried to play it. Let's start with pros: 45 levels with extensive locations (but boring and repetitive), virtual absence of bugs, epic loot. And cons: insipid gameplay, weak plot (despite the fact that the game has a lot of text), old idea taken from Diablo 2, awkward interface, level design, low opponents' artificial intelligence, terrible sound effects, clunky animations, restricted camera angle.\nThe game is like in an early development, there are no achievements or trading cards.

You have a simple variety of stats that you can upgrade when you level for better abilities. Health for your life force and Energy (which roughly equates to mana in D2) for your energy weapons.\n\nInstead of gems, you have Biochips which upgrade your character`s skills directly. There`s a fair bit of variety and game play is good enough in short doses between your other daily tasks or for a quick break.\n\nThe graphics are a little dated but go well with its simple stylized visuals. It will likely run well on a modest to low powered computer.\n\nMy recommendation goes to those with slower computers that want something that plays like Diablo 2, or for those who want a good "break game" that's engaging in short play sessions.","December 4, 2014","true","1.3"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

JUST ♥♥♥♥♥♥ END ALREADY, WOULD YOU!?!?" Why? because this game is incredibly reptitive and just plain waaaay too long...but that's about as far as the general bad aspects of this game go, if you ask me.\n\nBy now you've probably guessed that this game is a diablo rip off, that sounds bout right, just way longer, and actually a bit more challenging (by that i mean that with the right char, both diablo 1 and 2 just become a complete faceroll). Generally, this game is more of a patience test than an actual fun way to spend time, coz if you can actually beat every single level with a solid 0 on your mob count...then you've got one hell of a backbone, buddy. (up to about a dozen mobs left is also acceptable...lets be real, the maps are pretty large, and you won't gain much from rechecking every last corner for that last ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that just wouldn't come out when he was supposed to.)\n\nIf you're looking for a super thrilling and breathtaking experience that you'll just want to talk about for days to come, then just keep on walking and never look back, but if you've got a spare buck and just plain way too much time to kill...then this game has "magical mystery cure" written all over it for you.","December 4, 2014","true","49.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","6","9","3","0"

It has a shallow plot that comes down to you playing the part of a veteran soldier named Hack, the colony ship you are on flew into a dark nebula and now you've got to fight the aliens that live in the nebula to free your ship. The game may not look pretty, or be all that detailed or interesting. It does however manage to be a pretty long game considering the price, and budget they had when making the game.\n\nNow I have seen people argue that there is no fun in Space Hack, well I bet this game is right up many of your "alleys". I find this especially true for any of you who like playing classic games. Space Hack may not be old enough to warrant being called classic but it sure looks and feels like it.

Want to play a game that's as familiar like diablo, but looks blocky and annoying, has an interface that SCREAMS for you to ignore any information it gives you, and is wildly unintuitive despite being likely the 500th in 1000 games almost exactly like it? LOOK NO FURTHER. Your character may not start with any equipment, but HE DOES start with sideburns. The sum total of my experience with this game is as follows: I accidentally quit out of the intro cinematic when it paused for so long at some flavor text I assumed you had to click to advance it (nope -- it quits the cinematic!) then I contemplated why my head looked like a box until I figured out how to confirm that yep... despite having quests to go out into dangerous territory I had literally NO equipment. Guess they want me to earn some, or find some, or cut my teeth on weak enemies before they introduce me to the inventory aspects of the game. Wrong-O. Went outside, was beset by bug creatures and devoured. Then I deleted the game. If I was much younger and felt I had the time to waste I'd have given it what some might have considered a fairer shake. However, my time is honestly more valuable than anything I feel this game might have to offer me. Sad too, as I was in the mood for a futuristic diablo clone. If you want something like this that doesn't look like an angler-fish abortion, I suggest you take a look at "Space Siege."","December 11, 2014","false","0.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","8","17","2","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/315260/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1776 products in account","Even for 2005, this is far from a decent game. Action RPGs can already be a really dull and boring genre without any interesting aspects thrown in. Space Hack adds nothing, and what it does attempt is so underwhelming that it gives the player absolutely no reason to keep going through all of its mediocrity.\n\nThe plot is as uninspired as you can imagine. It's as if the developers were being forced at gunpoint to add a story to this game. The graphics are cheap looking and boring, as the game world and alien design are far too generic and bland for a game that came out in 2005. The sounds and special effects are terrible, and you will feel like muting the game after the first few hours. The music is probably the best part of the game, as it does provide a moody and atmospheric backdrop to what is being attempted onscreen. As for the gameplay itself, there is barely any action and barely any role playing elements here. What is there feels almost like a placeholder for something that was underdeveloped and not thought of for very long. The repetitive clicking stereotype of the action RPG genre is here, but even further stripped away of special abilities and different classes. In order to perform more than the normal attack, you will need to manually select the ability from another menu and right click if you want to use it. This limits the gameplay even more than what you should come to expect from the average action RPG game. Everything about Space Hack is so low quality, so boring, and so dull, that there is no reason at all to play it if you have access to the better action RPG games available. There is nothing redeeming and nothing interesting to be experienced in this game. The entire playthrough feels like a complete waste of time. In addition to all this, the game is also prone to crashing and suffers from extremely low frame rates.\n\nSpace Hack is mediocre.","February 25, 2015","false","14.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It pretty much throws you into the game without very much direction on where to go. It gives you a story and an almost idea of what to do, but you're kind of left at the start and you don't know what to do even after that intro. This ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off. What point is there in playing a game if you don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ to do? It's impossible to do so and have fun. Also, the mechanics were really messed up, even for an old game like this from 2005 - not because of a lot of glitches or anything like that, but because they're unbalanced and confusing. The controls are somewhat okay, but what annoyed me about THIS was that it's hard to access anything or find some kind of inventory. Apparently you have a club, but I couldn't even find an inventory, which SHOULD be located somewhere on the main screen, near your health bar for example but on the other corner. That would make it less of a pain. The combat isn't bad, it followed Diablo's system, but the confusion makes it tough, not as if I NEEDED to say that. In general, this game SHOULD be free. It's just not that good.","October 8, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Also be aware of the very strong bias in this review, as the game I have played for the longest in my entire life was Diablo 2 (online and offline). I have also fallen in love with Path of Exile, due to the vastness of the metagame seen in the character builds (see my PoE review for more details).\n\nThis will be my 73rd review, and I must first admit that this has been one of the most difficult ones to review in a while - the previous most difficult review was Starbound. It has definitely made me think of a new, critical element when reviewing games and considering the readers, which I will explain near the end. This game also made me sincerely wish that you could only see the recommended rating at the END of the review, so readers aren't primed by seeing the huge thumbs up/down symbol while looking at reviews.\n\nIf you like isometric action role-playing games similar to the renown Diablo series, space themes, and challenging gameplay, then you may enjoy this game. If you happen to be a veteran of isometric ARPGs, however, you may also end up disliking this game in favor of other, better alternatives.\n\nBefore we start, I just want to mention that this game is not bad or horrible. It also, however, is not good, but somewhere in between (subpar, mediocre).\n\nThe aesthetics are pretty decent, but very dated. You can see all items you equip on your character, which is very nice. The detail in the levels and character models are good. The music and sounds are good, and add to the space theme of the game - I actually find some of the ambient music quite soothing. The feedback similar to most isometric ARPGs - health and mana vials located at the bottom of the screen, and you can hold ALT to display enemy health and any loot on the ground. Pressing tab brings up the map, which is transparent and fills up most of the screen. The number of enemies and your current money/ammo is displayed at the top of the screen - a really good feature.\n\nThe controls were a bit different from what I was used to, but easy to pick up. There is no in-game tutorial, so take a look at the key bindings before heading out into the world. The camera ONLY rotates - you cannot zoom. I have noticed that the camera can reorient itself into awkward angles if you push up against walls or buildings, however, rotating the mouse easily fixes this. The learning curve is moderate to difficult depending on your experience with this genre. In particular, the aggressive mobs and their ability to detect AND chase you at medium ranges means that you can easily find yourself overwhelmed - especially in the beginning of the game. Furthermore, the grinding is fairly slow, so it may take a while before you level up and can equip better items. I strongly advise you to save often, as you can die at any time.\n\nAnother critical mechanic of the game is the currency - you use "energy cells" to pay for all items, however, you also use those same cells as ammo for any energy weapons you may equipped. Since basic necessities like health shots (your healing item) cost 100 cells, the start of your adventure will require a great deal of planning and balancing of energy management. Using projectiles can make the game a lot easier, as you can get surrounded by enemy mobs very quickly. Ammo is given in batches of 100 (for every 100 cells you have 1 "container/clip" of ammo, and the vials on the bottom right will deplete as you near the next multiple of 100).\n\nYou can repair your items (they have durability) and identify unidentified items that you loot.\n\nTo use "skills," you have to first purchase them from the store. Initially, you will only be able to use the "base teleport skill." To use it, you can equip it to a slot (hotkeys 1-5), and press the right mouse button when the skill is equipped. You will automatically teleport back to base, and can click the portal animation to return to the same spot (using up the two-way portal). Each skill has a set number of "uses," and these must be refilled (costs energy) back at base.\n\nThis game was offered for free, and, while it is unfair to compare a dated game with more modern games, I feel that I have to. Path of Exile is also free to play (and forever, it is not "only free for 24 hours"). If you are new to ARPGs, try that game before/after this one, so you can see your alternatives. If you are a veteran to ARPGs, you may want to honestly avoid this game.\n\nThe gameplay for Space Hack simply do not survive the test of time when compared to alternatives, and reviewing this game made me consider something I haven't really looked at before - time investment. ARPGs have an extremely powerful potential to receive time investments from their players - I know, I've played Path of Exile (outside of steam) and Diablo 2 so much I have no idea what to estimate as total playing time.\n\nAs a serious reviewer, I advise you to try this game out - maybe as a short-term filler game for an hour or two every now and then - if you are really interested in it. It IS and can be fun.\n\nHowever, I must also advise you to seek out alternatives, as you can be investing your time playing much, much better games, of qualities and calibers on a different level than this one.\n\nRecommend you try it for the short-term if you are really interested; recommend you stay away for the long-term if you intend to invest a good amount of your time into an ARPG.\n\nIf you like this review, please consider checking out DJSF's Rogue Reviews Steam Group for more in-depth reviews","August 6, 2014","false","3.0"," 12 of 27 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","12","27","0","7"

Since it's free for 24 hours I gave it a shot. I was not very impressed. I can live with the dated graphics, but no voices (only lots of text to read) and poor background sound. Also, loot drops are easily missed (although there is a sound effect when they happen) because they are so small. It's very hard in the beginning because you have little health and not many health packs. Also, stuff is way to expensive for the chip currency that you don't find enough of. Furthermore, I don't really understand the story or how these aliens are everywhere.

It's a ten year old sci-fi knockoff of Diablo II, probably produced on the cheap to profit off of Blizzard's success. The game balance is pretty off; it's hard to progress without abusing free heals. Nothing respawns, so you get a finite amount of resources, and given that there are enemies in the first area that can kill you in five or six hits, you either have to tank them and heal, or try (and probably fail) to sidestep their erratic attack patterns and plink away at them from range.\n\nThe "magic" system, Hi-Tech Devices, seems fairly interesting, but it's stat-gated such that you won't be able to use more than one or two of them in the first ten levels or so, or even longer if you're not putting most of your stat points into Knowledge, which will gimp everything but your energy weapons, including your ability to wear armor.\n\nIt also tried to implement a currency/ammo tradeoff, by making your Energy (which you use to fire laser guns and such) rechargeable only by spending 100 of your (finite) currency, which just ends up being incredibly limiting, especially in the early stages of the game.\n\nIt's nice for killing time, but nothing about it seems to have aged well. It might get better later on, once there are more options available, but the first few hours were fairly tedious, and really gave only one style of play a chance of progression. Pick up Path of Exile or Marvel Heroes if you really need an action-RPG.","August 5, 2014","false","2.8"," 28 of 62 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","28","62","0","2"

Released as "Maximus XV: Abraham Strong Space Mercenary" in Germany it was released in the US under its current title. At first it seems like a no brainer-lot's of loot, lots of monsters to kill, and set in a futuristic setting but there's not much to write home about here.\n\nThe game is grindy as hell due to the energy bits required to fuel any weapon worth anything doubling as your currency. This means the game punishes you for mistakes rather than turning them into learning opportunities. Death is severely punishing as well. If you don't save frequently you will have to go through everything you did before all over again. A system such as the one in Fate or Torchlight (Pay gold to respawn immediately, pay less gold to go back to the entrance, pay nothing to restart back in town) would have been far more beneficial, and way less annoying.\n\nWhile the graphics are OK what few animations exist are stiff. The sound design is almost non-existent, and the soundtrack is forgettable. There's very little enemy variety, very little loot variety, and even less appearance variety. The story is minimal-standard go here, kill this many of that, come back fare-and there's very little variety as far as areas go, too.\n\nThe Tl;dr of this is that this is a very disappointing game, and I wouldn't recommend it unless you (like me) crave DIablo in space so much that you'll play a game so deserving of the title 'Hack' that the developers made it part of its name.","August 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","3"

I love indie games and the worst I usually have to say about them is that Endermen keep breaking into my house and touching my things.\n\nHonestly, the only people I think this might be targeted towards are 8-year-olds who may not care.

It was released pretty late in the whole Diablo hype, though, and is kind of lost in the many games that exist today.  The game may have been great in it's prime, but in the modern age of gaming, this game fails to impress, and I do not recommend it.  Though the game is a dollar, so the choice is up to you.\n\nSpace Hack claims to offer "50-80 hours of gameplay!"  Note that this is on the retail box.  While this does sound like a great reason to buy it, I was pretty bored within the first 5 hours.  The game does some pretty low-blow crap, like having to travel out for an objective, get severely hurt, travel back to camp, heal, head out, get hurt, return to camp, heal, ect, ect.  This system was obviously created to make the game longer.  And it's a ♥♥♥♥ing pain.  The music has no specific genre, and really never tries to create an atmosphere.  The visuals are pretty poor, even for the time period that the game was created in, and the game is very inconvenient to play on a modern computer.  The game runs at a really low resolution, somewhere around 720x600, and if you have a  second monitor, it'll ♥♥♥♥ around with it.  Even if there weren't these minor inconveniences, I still woulden't recommend this game.  While the gameplay is decent, it basically borrows 80% of gameplay from Diablo 1.  You might as well play that.\n\nAt the end of the day, I tried to enjoy Space Hack, but I just coulden't.  Since it's a dollar, though, the choice is up to you.  Maybe you'll enjoy it more than I did.","August 13, 2014","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A few times I've had to escape from a horde of aliens only to find that I had to walk away while dodging projectiles at the same time\n• Health system: the medkit drop is extremely low, specially for a game where even on easy 3 or 4 hits will kill you, and where monsters are generally organized in clusters\n• Ammo/Currency: just like in Metro 2033 you use ammo to pay, this time in the form of energy cells, this forces you to focus at least a bit on melee combat, which is a little complicated considering the two previous limitations I mentioned\n\nIf you feel like you want a challenge and you have nothing else to play, and specially if you can get it on a sale, I'd say it's a pretty decent "diablo clone" in space, otherwise I'd advice you to put your money somewhere else.\n\n55/100","May 3, 2015","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/graycrimsonplays/recommended/315260/","graycrimsonplays","GrayCrimson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/graycrimsonplays/","126 products in account","This game is everything wrong about a point&click game.\nFor starters, I do not hate point&click games, I actually like them. I have a high level account on aqworlds and I enjoy getting on sometimes.\nLet's get back on track, and I will describe each aspect of this game.\n\n1.Controls:\nThis game has decent controls. The idea is a point and click. You click an enemy to attack; you click on the ground to move there. One thing this game actually did right.\n2.Graphics:\nFor a game thats around 300MB, the graphics are alright. For basing it on games around the time period it was created, the graphics are terrible. The environment looks like it's been pooped on and the NPCs look like stiff old grandparents.\nYour character looks ugly. He is a scruff, tall black haired man with an eyepatch. Who would want to play a game as a character like that? And no, this is definitly NOT a pirate game.\n3.Logic\nThis game has no logic. The NPCs in the beginning say how your character is the only one who can defeat the aliens. There are many problems with that. If the NPCs depend on you, they would give you gear and money. You start off with no money and just your fists.  YOU HAVE TO KILL ALIENS THAT SHOOT AT YOU WITH YOUR FISTS. You will have to go back and forth between the environment and your base in order to heal over and over. If you die once, you have to go back to your last save point. The game only autosaves between maps, and going to your base is NOT an autosave point. Finally, everything in the base looks futuristic with machinery and such, right? Your main weapon is a BOW. WHY?!?! This game should have you using energy swords and epic gauntlets and plasma weapons, not clubs, swords, and a BOW. A normal ol' BOW!\n4.Gameplay\nHorrid, repetitive and boring. The enemies drop so little money you have to grind for hours to buy one little weapon. In order to use weapons, your level has to rise. I farmed for an hour and still haven't past level 1. Drop rates are horrendous and you're likely to get a weapon that doesn't even work for you. This game is a clone for Path of Exile I believe, so play that, and not this pile of garbage.\n5.Replayability/Multiplayer/Local\nYou cannot play with more than one player. This is a one player game, with an MMO system. What's so good about hitting max level if there's no one around you to show it off too? No replay value with no new mechanics or anything if you win(I got too bored to even try to win). Also, this game never updates so there's no point in playing any more, and no DLC. No new character models. NOTHING.\n\nFinal Score: 2/10\nThe only reason it gets a 2 was that I got this game for free(1), and the fact that it's a game(1). It's the worst of the worst, and unless you won this in a giveaway(I understand why it was given away), don't buy this.","May 25, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd rather go boot up old-school Diablo/Diablo2 again and play it rather than play this game.  I'd love to see someone take the concept and build a similar experience around modern game approaches and engines.\n\n","June 21, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want a badass isometric game for free go get Path of Exile and love life again.\n","May 26, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlipperySnail/recommended/315260/","SlipperySnail","SlipperySnail","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SlipperySnail/","91 products in account","General Thoughts/ImpressionsSpace Hack is a modernized sci-fi Diablo, where you are in an encampment. When you first open up the game, the default resolution is a 1024x768 resolution, and can be set up to have a 1920x1080 resolution. Not that resolutions really mattered, the User Interface is scaled based on your resolution.\n\nGameplay is what you can imagine from Diablo, and though I make so many references to Diablo, there's nothing else I can really think about it. Even the NPCs around town have the same kind of options as you would with Diablo, where the main storygiver heals you and identifies items for you. That's not to say that copying it was a poor idea, but it's just something I noticed.\n\nSeeing as the price generally isn't very high that often, try to get the game when it's on sale.","June 1, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have a high level account on aqworlds and I enjoy getting on sometimes.\nLet's get back on track, and I will describe each aspect of this game.\n\n1.Controls:\nThis game has decent controls. The idea is a point and click. You click an enemy to attack; you click on the ground to move there. One thing this game actually did right.\n2.Graphics:\nFor a game thats around 300MB, the graphics are alright. For basing it on games around the time period it was created, the graphics are terrible. The environment looks like it's been pooped on and the NPCs look like stiff old grandparents.\nYour character looks ugly. He is a scruff, tall black haired man with an eyepatch. Who would want to play a game as a character like that? And no, this is definitly NOT a pirate game.\n3.Logic\nThis game has no logic. The NPCs in the beginning say how your character is the only one who can defeat the aliens. There are many problems with that. If the NPCs depend on you, they would give you gear and money. You start off with no money and just your fists.  YOU HAVE TO KILL ALIENS THAT SHOOT AT YOU WITH YOUR FISTS. You will have to go back and forth between the environment and your base in order to heal over and over. If you die once, you have to go back to your last save point. The game only autosaves between maps, and going to your base is NOT an autosave point. Finally, everything in the base looks futuristic with machinery and such, right? Your main weapon is a BOW. WHY?!?! This game should have you using energy swords and epic gauntlets and plasma weapons, not clubs, swords, and a BOW. A normal ol' BOW!\n4.Gameplay\nHorrid, repetitive and boring. The enemies drop so little money you have to grind for hours to buy one little weapon. In order to use weapons, your level has to rise. I farmed for an hour and still haven't past level 1. Drop rates are horrendous and you're likely to get a weapon that doesn't even work for you. This game is a clone for Path of Exile I believe, so play that, and not this pile of garbage.\n5.Replayability/Multiplayer/Local\nYou cannot play with more than one player. This is a one player game, with an MMO system. What's so good about hitting max level if there's no one around you to show it off too? No replay value with no new mechanics or anything if you win(I got too bored to even try to win). Also, this game never updates so there's no point in playing any more, and no DLC. No new character models. NOTHING.\n\nFinal Score: 2/10\nThe only reason it gets a 2 was that I got this game for free(1), and the fact that it's a game(1). It's the worst of the worst, and unless you won this in a giveaway(I understand why it was given away), don't buy this.","May 25, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Controls, enemies and sound effects leave much to wish for. I do not know if good or bad is better in this and I am more neutral to game than recomending it. If you are game collector and have no high standtard then this is a good one! But if you just want good games then keep looking in other places.","January 23","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
