I remember he would draw maps of the rooms and mark where he found treasure and health etc.  It was always thrilling finding dog food and ammo hidden behind a Hitler portrait or giant Swastika.  I always knew something big was about to happen whenever the brick color changed from grey to red or blue.\n\nThe high quality 3D graphics are only surpassed by the excellent sound effects and soundtrack.

You will also be missing the point of how important this was to the history of FPS games.\n\nThe game is simple to pick up, hard to master.  To master the toughest difficulty, I am Death Incarnate, you will need some good FPS skills, good choice of knowing when to use each type of weapon and some level knowledge.    The game is also has a good element of skill to it.  The closer you are, the more likely you are to hit as well as get hit.  You can also take a lot more damage up close so you have to be careful going through doorways and in tight spaces.\n\nThere are secrets to find, treasure to pick up, par times to bet, Hitler to kill, and a ton of Nazis to mow down on the way.  The game even lets you hold MORE THAN TWO GUNS AT ONCE! :P  However there are only two weapons you will use long term, the grey machine gun which has great economy with the bullets and a decent rate of fire.  There is also the gatling gun which never gets tiring to use.  It has an amazing sound, an amazing red flash on the screen and watching your ammo quickly depleting makes you realise just how powerful it is.\n\nFor a perfectionist this game is great, at the end of each level you are rated on what % you kill, what % of the secrets you found and how much of of the nazi loot you confiscated. Back in the 90s I spent a lot of time carefully walking around every wall holding down space waiting to hear the magical sound of a new secret passage opening.  The the excitement of wondering if I've found just a block of ammo, or maybe a crapload of treasure.\n\nThe game has 6 episodes, each with 9 levels + a secret level on each episode.\n\nGET PSYCHED!","December 8, 2013","true","0.4"," 98 of 101 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","98","101","0","1"

It has half a foot still in the "atari, beep boop, life and point system" ground, and this becomes obvious after trying to 100% any given level. All the maps look very, very similar, it beccomes difficult to tell WHERE you are without the use of the map, and in general it's insanely difficult to play the game to the full potential it deserves.\nThe vast majority of the secrets are hidden among identical looking walls, gameplay boils down to corner camping the basic ai, and there's really, really not much to say, since the entire game is a basic package with nothing more than basic floor layout with only right angles, and the sound is nothing but muffled sound effects they could pull off at the time with a small group of midi's used repeatedly (space on floppy drives was incredibly small) for atmosphere.\n\nDespite all this, the game DOES get a free pass simply for being so stooped in history. Without this game, you wouldn't have the vast majority of FPS we have now. If you want to buy this to know your roots, go ahead, but be warned, it's about as odd as a time capsule could be.","October 19, 2013","true","4.7"," 62 of 67 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","62","67","0","2"

Well drown those terrible memories of 6 year olds calling you a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with some Wolfenstein 3D.\n\nSome of you have probably played it back in the 90s. If you have, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR BUY IT RIGHT FREAKING NOW!!!!\n\nAs for those who haven't played it, I'll tell you about the game. It's world war 2 and you are a dude who has been captured by the Nazis and has been taken to Castle Wolfenstein. You start inside a room with a Nazis corpse and then you go and "Get yo self some Nazi scalps". But heres what makes this game better than modern fps games. There aren't any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t things like having to put up with some stupid scenario where you have to walk slow for 30 ♥♥♥♥ing minutes (*cough* *cough* Call Of Duty), instead you get to get right into the action without any delays. There are tons of secrets to find and so much fun to be had with this game. The levels are so open and it's like any other old school shooter. Kill some dudes, look for secrets, find keys to open doors and complete the levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vainvair/recommended/2270/","vainvair","Vain Vair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vainvair/","2163 products in account","Note: This game was played on a source port called ECWolf[maniacsvault.net] and I wholeheartedly recommend downloading it to better your experience with the game, adding a few modern features, more resolutions, and turning off the Y-axis so moving the mouse forward doesn't make you move forward as well.\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb here and assume most people have heard of Wolfenstein 3D already, but just in case someone hasn't here is a brief history.\n\nThough not being the absolute first of its kind, Wolfenstein 3D is a game highly regarded as the progenitor of the first-person shooter genre, created by id Software in 1992, no mater what anyone may say about how good the game is or not these days, it at least has to be respected for the creation of one of the most prolific video game genres to date.\n\nYou play as William Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz, a Polish American spy sent on a mission to find out the nazi's plans and stop them, which usually means climbing nine floors and murdering someone at the top or bottom, along the way killing S.S. troops and undead mutants.\n\nAs you can tell, the story is not really all that important, as famed programmer for id John Carmack once said, and I quote, "Story in a game is like a story in a porn movie. It's expected to be there, but it's not that important." So given this mentality you can pretty much write off the story as just a means to let you shoot stuff, and this was back before most games even bothered to put effort in their plotlines to start with.\n\nSo that means onto the gameplay, ever played a first-person shooter before? Well then you will fit right at home, the game is simple as far as controls and objectives, you walk around and only are able to look left and right, fighting in stages of block shaped rooms and mazes, looking for keys and doors to get you to the final switch, pulling it and moving onto the next level, there are six episodes and each one has nine levels and one hidden map that is gotten to by finding a hidden elevator in one of the stage, totaling sixty levels in all there is actually a lot of game here.\n\nYou have three gun types and a knife, though the guns all use the same ammo counter and about the same damage except each one shoots faster then the one before it, levels are sometimes straightforward, and sometimes mazes you must run through, most of the level design is fun and varied up to a point, given they don't have very much to work with other then walls, floors, and sometimes hanging moss.\n\nThe big question is if it is worth playing, and actually even today, over twenty years after its creation, it is still fun to play, sure it is simple and chances are not anything you haven't seen before from more modern shooters, but it has that old retro charm to it that is hard to explain, it is bright and colorful, has treasure and arcade-like qualities such as lives and a score, and despite how old and dated it seems, I still believe it is worth taking a look at.","October 15, 2014","true","7.2"," 46 of 48 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","46","48","3","0"

I resently played this using one of its numerous ports, namely ECWolf. It added support for several control schemes much like in a modern shooter, giving me a good reason to jump back in and play it.\n\nAnd bhoyo.. Was it hard. I almost immediately cranked the difficulty to "Death Incarnate" and I have currently blasted through 5 of the 6 total episodes and during that time of pixelated and very profound carnage, I realised something.\n\nI was enjoying the game. It was a rather strange feeling, mostly due to not having it happen in a long while. The last game that I remember doing it was Mafia and yes, I realise that it is an entirely different game and it is very narrative driven, but I enjoyed it. Something that cannot be said from some of the games I have resently reviewed. (Fkng Bureau..)\n\nAnyway, back to the matter at hand.\n\nAlthough Wolfenstein 3D has aged, it still looks great. There is something about this early-age of computing graphics, that is just amazing. The way they had to work with hardware limitations, limited colours and not to mention floppy drives. Ughh.. I tell you, I resently got one of those cheap USB ones and I suddenly remembered how moody those fkrs are.\n\nWhere was I? Oh yes.. Even with the age of the game, its pixely graphics and all. It still manages to stay relevant, even after 23-Years. Let's think on that number there for a minute.. 23, a lifetime ago for some people. Including me and for everyone who grew up during the 90's.\n\nI keep digressing, I apoligize. But this is partly why people appreciate these games, they are part of their past, their childhood and that is just way too important to ignore.\n\n\nLet's talk about the actual game a little bit, now that I've got the nostalgia chip off my shoulder.\n\nThe game is an FPS, I can't really explain more than that. It is the most basic of things, get gun, find secret, get bigger gun, kill everything.\n\nThe game is silly, very much so and it does not give a f**k. The story is the most basic of basics, yet again.\n\nThe biggest issue that I have with the game, is the level layouts, they are mazes. I remember a wonderfull story of being stuck in one level for a day, just because I could not find the door and to make it better, there is no map system.\n\nHee,hee everyone dies.. 8D\n\nThere is very little that can be said about the game besides these two things, yet again, it is the first. I know that tere are other FPS games before Wolf3D, but this is the one everyone remembers so.. Meh.\n\nI don't think I need to pad this out any longer, I think you got what I'm saying here, right?\n\nBut to recap.\n\nWolfenstein 3D is a worthwile classic. Even for something of its age, it manages to stay entertaining. The modding and source-port community keeps the game alive, there are numerous mods on sites like ModDB. That can be used to enhance the experience or change it completely. I would highly recommend the ECWolf mod, it is easy to install and only reguires a copy of the game files found in the program folder. Similiar to Brutal Doom in that respect.\n\nThe game can take a good number of hours to finish, even with the mods making it more playable. But the enjoyment is there and for those brave enough to go-a-romping through Castle Wolfenstein,\n\nstay calm,\nkeep a gun handy,\nand always eat the dog-food when at low health.","August 31, 2015","true","1.5"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","95","41","43","10","6"

I had a friend who spent many of his class periods in separate classes for “developmentally challenged students” (It wasn’t me, I promise). Basically the special teachers would give the special students the answers to tests and do their homework for them so they wouldn’t fail and bring the class GPA down. Anyway, somehow I was able to sneak away from normal kid study hall to go hang out with my buddy every day, and because his school assignments were handed to him on a silver platter, we had all sorts of time to play “educational games” on the school’s nifty Macintosh computer. Back in those days Mac wasn’t exactly known for having enjoyable games, and the school had enough sense to purchase only games that no one would want to play. Titles such as “Wacky Jacks”, “Sim Tower”, and “Dr. Quandry” were the 3 gems we had to choose from.\n\nWhy all of this non-Wolfenstein related talk? Well I’m getting to that, you see, while the educational powers that be may have done their best to sanitize our academic computer usage of any fun, they overlooked one small detail. One of the games came with a demo to Wolfenstein3D. We loaded that thing up, and study hall forevermore turned into a Nazi bloodbath. The Demo only allowed us to play up to the elevator on the 1st floor, but we killed every last Nazi and found every secret on that level, and once we flipped that lever we would do it all over again.\n\nBut don’t think for one second that I didn’t learn anything. It became apparent to me after several level one playthroughs that the Nazis lost WWII due to poor resource management. The amount of Hitler tapestries and Nazi flags that adorn the compound hallways must have cost a fortune, imagine if that money had been put into the war effort? The construction of secret passage ways couldn’t be cheap either, and the amount of gold, firearms, and ammunition just sitting around on the ground collecting dust might have been devastating had the Nazis implemented their use against the Allies. Turns out the Nazis fit in perfectly in re-tard study hall after-all.\n\nMein Leben!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/2270/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Wolfenstein 3D is one of the earliest 3D FPS games ever made. You play as BJ Blazkowicz who is trapped in a Nazi prison and must escape through maze like environments. Through some unexplained reason he starts off with a pistol, which is fine considering the story is barely existent. This Steam version features the extra 3 prequel mission packs that double the amount of episodes from the base game. The prequel episodes are Episode 4-6 but I suggest starting off at Episode 1 since the prequel missions are significantly harder. There are four difficultly settings overall. The first two feature much less enemies so you will not be worrying that much about health or ammo and as a result make it feel more like a puzzle game. The other 2 feature tougher enemies and much more enemies occasionally placed in rather  inconvenient areas. Both offer completely viable playstyles.\n\nThe gameplay feels more tactical than just running and gunning. A single well placed bullet can take up to 80% of your health and you will not be able to dodge since the game takes a realistic approach as to how fast bullets go through the air. So even the lowest of grunts can kill you if he has a faster trigger finger than you. Luckily they suffer the storm trooper effect of being unlikely to hit anything more than a couple of feet away and even if they manage to the bullet damage is decreased the further away you are. Which leads you to playing very carefully, scouting the area instead of simply rushing through hallways like a supersoilder. There is a 99 ammo limit  which seems like a lot but all the weapons share the same ammunition which leads to more depth as you decide which of the 3 guns are best suited for each situation.\n\nThe 3 weapons are as follows, a starting pistol which is very effective close range but puts you in risk of a fatal shot, a submachine gun which is pretty solid in medium range but uses up more ammo and a chaingun that annihilates enemies but burns through precious ammunition quickly. There is also a weak knife that you won't be using except in the most dire of situations.  You start off with 100% health and can be regenerated by multiple items including health packs, turkey legs, and dog food. It is a rather strange feeling when you are on the verge of death and are overjoyed to see dog food. Though the real joy comes when you push against a wall and it slides open to reveal much needed supplies and nazi treasure. While we are on the topic of ill gotten goods I should mention there is a scoring and live system. Killing enemies and finding treasure generate points and when you get enough you will receive an extra life that puts you at the beginning of the level with just a pistol when you die. Which I find to be rather odd considering there are manual saves but can be useful if you save at a very inopportune time.\n\nOnto graphics. They are very,very outdated, obviously considering the age of the game. But it does negatively effect the experience since all of the walls have the same basic textures which make rooms look basically the same which can be confusing. Added to that problem is the fact that the level design makes no sense. The rooms have no logical rhythm to them and are just randomly stringed together, along with a lack of a map it is needless to say not a game for those that constantly forget where they parked their car. The enemy models look pretty good ranging from German Shepards to Nazi Zombies. There are no ceiling or floor textures either which I didn't find to be much of a problem since most of the game is gray. There are occasional plants and objects thrown about to liven the place up but they may have gone a little overboard with the amount of swastikas and Hitler pictures around. All in all I'd say the 3D effect is awesome but not much else.\n\nThe sound in this game is good for the most part. Guns sound powerful and add intensity to the gun fights. As for the enemies I have no idea how good the voice acting is since I do not speak German but they do sound rather comical. Though it is extremely helpful since each enemy have their own audio line when they are alerted to your presence which lets you easily identify the type of enemy and their numbers. The metal bunker doors also have a nice sounding effect when opened and closed letting you know that the enemy is on the look for you. Unfortunately the music is pretty bad and gets annoying after a short amount of time. Strangely enough they saved the only good tracks for Episode 3 and they were never seen again.\n\nOverall this game is very basic with nothing more to do than search the environment and shoot foes which I can see getting unbearably repetitive for some. You will also need a good sense of direction to get much enjoyment from this game. If you can get past that you will find a very fun game which has exhilarating boss fights,  plenty of secrets and tons of missions to play through. It also has cool secret levels including one where you fight the ghosts from Pacman. So buckle up, find a chaingun and show them Nazis that a guy named BJ is no laughing matter!","December 19, 2014","true","17.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","10","10","5","0"

Basic and easy controls, a choice of only 4 weapons (sharing the same ammo) and a nice amount of secret walls and treasure on each level make this game very rewarding and loveable. id's typical sense of humour can be witnessed throughout the complete gameplay in inter-episode texts, the enemies' speech as they see you and as they die, as well as Wolfenstein's famous PacMan secret level, make this game unique and amazing.\n\nAlthough it is possible to download the game for free, you will be glad to have paid some money for it.\n\nWhere would FPSs be nowadays if id Software had pursued a different path and never developed Wolfenstein 3D? Would have another company dared make an incursion into FPSs? Would the 2398 Call of Duties of today exist? Or Half-Life?\n\nEvery FPS in the shelf today owes its existance to this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/recommended/2270/","trar","Hammurabi of Babylon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/trar/","318 products in account","Basically, if you're curious about gaming history and know what you're getting into, this is a pretty entertaining vintage FPS and it's worth a look - but I do mean vintage. If for whatever reason you didn't like DOOM, you'll like this game even less.\n\nThis game technically wasn't the first FPS, but it was the first FPS if you catch my drift, and it jumpstarted the genre like lightning ripping through Frankenstein. If you're interested, I would recommend using a sourceport like ECWolf[maniacsvault.net] instead of the DOSBox emulation you get here; Steam's DOSBox emulation for games is generally poor quality. What you're really paying for are the actual game files, so you might as well.\n\n\nWolfenstein 3-D, the third game and first FPS in the overall Wolfenstein series, is first and foremost a piece of history and a pretty mechanically simple first-person shooter - at least on the surface. Released via shareware in 1992, it was iD's first FPS and second 'proper hit' after Commander Keen. At the time, its fast, brutal Nazi-killing action was much more shocking to people than many games today: it was simply a new thing back then. This was released before the ESRB even existed, and it says something that iD voluntarily rated their game PC-13 - for Profound Carnage.\n\nYou play as B.J. Blazkowicz, World War II Allied agent. You're charged with solo infiltration of Nazi strongholds to hamper their war effort in various ways. This involves, surprise surprise, shooting a good number of Nazis. To put the gameplay itself shortly, it can be fun as a surreal experience and a raw, oftentimes challenging shooter. Given how it's designed, however, it gets old after half an episode of playtime. It's best played in chunks, unless of course you really want to shoot Nazis and steal their treasure - this game is dated as a 25+ year old game would be, and is probably suited for hardier players who can handle frustration to appreciate a classic.\n\n\nThere are 6 episodes of 10 maps each, including each episode's secret map. You navigate the maps, dispatch Nazis, search for keys to progress if you need them, and pick up ammo and health lying on the floor when needed. There's no looking up or down; even the floors and ceilings are a single texture here. Secrets can be found by pushing on the correct wall tiles, and they're still satisfying to find more than 20 years later.\n\nThere are treasure items scattered around some maps presumably looted by your enemies, treasure that you can loot back...or carry around in a magic bag, or simply destroy them on the spot seeing as there's no way B.J. can carry all that stuff around with him normally. However B.J. does it, getting treasure increases your score.\n\nThis along with the lives system are interesting parts of an otherwise straight-shooting game: indicators of a transition between the games of old and the games Wolf3D would end up inflencing even today.\n\nThe enemies you'll most often face are brown-uniformed pistol guards, machine gun-toting Schutzstaffel who wear blue uniforms for some reason, and German shepherds. You'll encounter white-clad, crack-shot officers and deadly mutants in the later episodes, both of which are enemies to watch out for.\n\nWhat they lack in complexity of AI they make up for in numbers, positioning and individual tactical behavior, much like DOOM's enemies. At the end of every episode is a unique boss, and they range from a bit difficult to quite hard, and without strafing (Alt+movement with vanilla controls) they are impossible.\n\nYou'll have up to four weapons to choose from:\n\n* semi-automatic knife - you have to fire once every time you want to attack with it, and you need to time stealth kills just right or hope you stun your target enough\n* semi-automatic Luger - good for precise takedowns of weak enemies\n* non-descript machine gun - pretty much your default weapon, good for taking out multiple targets and handfuls of stronger enemies\n* non-descript ammo-eating chaingun - for those rooms just full of Nazi ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s\n\nCompounding your weapon 'choices' are the fact that you can only carry 99 bullets.\n\n\nThe music is mostly decent, but while some of it is pretty good (for 1992 anyway) it loops fast and can get a bit grating after a while. Combined with the blank colored ceiling and floor, intently deployed scenery, labrynthine & abstracted maps with no automapping feature by default, 1992 sound effects, 'unique' game mechanics and often tense nature of gameplay, I meant it when the game can get difficult and surreal at times.\n\nOn the higher difficulty maps it's not uncommon for a single enemy to take a good chunk of your health off with one shot, to say nothing of an SS' machine gun or mutant attack. There are a good number of enemies on the later maps, you don't have any armor, and on some maps health itself can be hard to come by. And on some maps, opening fire on an enemy can alert most of the map's other enemies at the same time.\n\nFortunately, you have the aforementioned multiple life system...which is mostly rendered moot by your limitless and merciful ability to save anywhere.\n\nThe controls are not very configurable (in the base DOSBox version) and can take some getting used to. You can at least enable mouse movement, which I much prefer. If you want modern controls, the previously mentioned ECWolf sourceport lets you customize them - ECWolf also has the highest quality music and framerate you can get for this game.\n\nWhile the game can be played at a fast pace, it is more common and usually prudent to take a cautious and slower approach, and there is ultimately more of an emphasis on tactics - positioning, luring and predicting enemies - than aiming ability (apart from capping unaware enemies) and dodging (what little of it you can do, anyway). You can still run and gun of course, but that's easier said than done sometimes, especially when compared with its successor Doom.\n\n\nIn fact, while this game is ostensibly macho, some of the situations you can find yourself in can be unnerving. You aren't always comfortably in control of situations, with lurking enemies that could kill you in seconds & map design that works against you, and this happens more and more in the later episodes. Wolfenstein 3-D is still ultimately a simple game at heart, but it does a lot with what it has. For more reading about this topic I recommend Liz Ryerson's writing about the game[ellaguro.blogspot.com].\n\n\nSo...is it worth playing after two decades? Well, I think so. See the very first paragraph for why. It's not for everyone, given its age and the way it plays, but for people who like old-school games, gaming history and/or really like shooting Nazis, I'd recommend it.\n\nIt's cheaper than The New Order, at least.","September 16, 2014","true","12.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Y/N\n\nFor me, definitely not. This game has dropped such a nostalgia bomb that it should be illegal. Everything from the DOS running system, the crude sound effects, the 2d props, the basic high contrast colors, and the rigorous tearing sound you get when using the open button are just exceptional. This game set the standard for how shooters were to be made following its release, simply because it was the first. Being that the designers had literally nothing to go off of; they did a hell of a job for both the year of its release (1992) and the technology available.\n\nA definite recommend for those that love nostalgia, the 90's, FPS's, or all of the above.","December 25, 2014","true","11.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

Made by ID software back in 1992 it was to various game consoles and home computer systems. But as unique as it was it was also a very infamous game amongst parents. It was infamous for it's nazi symbolism, Violence against animals and in 1994 germany's court even banned and confiscated this game from stores in their nation for racism and nazi referances. Long story short fun for the whole family!\n\nBut enough with old stuff and on to the practical parts. Wolftenstein 3D is a maze based classic FPS game where the player has to fight his way through levels to escape. The game exists of 6 episodes each with their own final boss to defeat. handy to know is that this game supports keyboard, mouse, and joystick, none of them are hard to use so you should have no real trouble getting used to them. the game also comes with several difficulty modes which each respectively affect damage, enemy accuracy, enemy speed, and damage taken whch makes this game suitable for most players. Another thing that will probably save your bacon many times is that this game has a save feature you can use so be sure to save often.\n\nLastly i would not recommend this game to very young audiences or people who suffer from claustrophobia. As fun as this game can be it can become too much as well.\n\nAll the best!\n\n(s.i.e)","July 13, 2014","true","6.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Released on may 5, 1992, for the PC operating system DOS, many believe that this game started the FPS genre for games as we know and love today.\n\nFull Review\nOriginally, Wolfenstein was released in parts. However, with the steam release for the game you will have full access to all levels and episodes for you to play through at your own pace. In the full game, there are about 6 episodes, and in each episode there are 9 levels. $5.49 is a good price for a retro game only 9MB in size and has about 54 levels in total.\n\nThe protagonist's name is William "B.J." Blazkowicz. Blazkowicz is an American spy of Polish desent. The first three episodes of the game are based around B.J. and his efforts to stop the Nazi regime. In the first episode, B.J. over powers his prison guard and escapes the Nazi prison. In the 2nd episode, B.J. finds out that the Nazi army in creating undead soldiers and B.J. tries to stop the evil doctor behind their creation. At the end of the third episode, B.J. faces off against Adolf Hitler in his underground bunker, Hitler is waiting in a robotic suit equipped with four heavy chain guns, these three episodes put together make for an amazing gamplay experience, and challenge which should take about 1.5 hours to complete. (If you don't get lost).\n\nIf you love the classic game, or just enjoy run-and-gun FPS shooters, then Wolfenstein 3D would be a good game for you, and I would wholeheartedly recommend this game.","December 28, 2014","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Getting flanked by a Nazi and not being able to turn fast enough or one that shoots you from behind a door before the door even opens enough to see them.  Or those planters that they deviously colored just like the Nazis.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  The great grand-daddy of FPS.  You navigate a series of mazes to find an elevator and any keys needed to open the doors that block it and are scored at the end of each based on your time, kills, and secrets found.  You're armed with a knife and the 3 guns you can pick up. (pistol, submachine gun, and Gatling-gun).  You can only carry 99 bullets so ammo is always a concern, especially since all your guns share the same rounds and the automatics burn them fast, but that's part of the game's core design.  Many secret passages contain guns and ammo but there's no hint to what walls open, so you just have to rub against them all.\n\nCONTROLS:  You can turn left and right and also strafe by holding shift but you cannot look or aim vertically.  It doesn’t seem too picky about your horizontal accuracy either, you just aim in a Nazi’s general direction and drop them (good thing too since there’s no iron sight or crosshairs).\n\nSTORY:  Kill Nazis go!  You’re a captured spy and the game contains 6 episodes of 10 floors each.  Episode 1 has you tasked with escaping while the others have other objectives such as killing various madmen bosses, including Hitler.\n\nGRAPHICS:  They’re bad.  There’s not even a texture for the entire floor or ceiling.  It’s the flattest looking 3-D game you’ll ever see.  But 3 dimensions had to start somewhere and you’re looking at it here.  There’s no resolution or graphics options at all.\n\nPERFORMANCE:  This didn’t even tax computers 20 years ago.  It launches in DOSbox and ran perfectly for me.\n\nSOUND:  Better than the graphics and there are some memorable Nazi death cries.  The music is creepy yet fun at the same type, a military style and it works well.\n\nREPLAYABILITY:  Other than the curiosity or nostalgia factor there is a scoring system and secrets to find but it’s unlikely many people would be compelled to keep playing.  But any FPS fan or retro gamer should at least try this.\n\nSIMILAR TO:  Doom, Star Wars Dark Forces, Shadow Warrior\n\nRECOMMENDED PURCHASE PRICE:  <$5 (often included in Doom promotions)\n\n\nTITLE:  Wolfenstein 3D\nDEVELOPER:  id Software\nRELEASED:  1992 (Steam page is incorrect)\n\n80/100","July 29, 2014","true","2.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Firing it up on our old 386 computer was amazing - suddenly this big, heavy beige box, which normally only displayed a very ancient, chunky version of Windows, was now playing a high-speed game with graphics and sound better than anything being done on the various game consoles we had plugged into the TV in the other room. And even though I was never really much good at Wolfenstein back then, its raw display of the PC's power and more importantly, the promise of what was to come for games, made me instantly fall in love with the idea of making computer graphics / games.\n\nThis version of Wolf3D is better than the one we had on our old PC back then, in that it is the full version with all the episodes, instead of just the shareware copy with the single first episode.\n\nThe graphics, while revolutionary at the time, are plain but still get the job done. The same can be said for the digital sound.\n\nIf you've never played it, I suggest you give this game a try. If you're a fan of the FPS genre, it'll give you a good history lesson, and I suspect you'll find that this game is just as fun and engaging as most of the modern titles that have come to succeed it. You might even find yourself yelping and jumping out of your seat, as I recently did, when you zoom around a corner and an unexpected Nazi calls out and begins firing at you.

Before Doom, Wolfenstein 3-D captivated players with impressive 3D enviroments for the time.\n\nA lot of people say it hasn't aged well, but I think it has. It's a pretty fun game, but it can get boring. It's basically just the gameplay of Doom except you have lives and shoot Nazis and collect treasure. The levels are all flat planed dungeon/castle theme levels due to the limitations of the engine. There are no elevated surfaces and ceilings and floors have no texture. Still though, that doesn't mean it's bad. It may tire you after a while of play though.\n\nAll you have to do is get to the end of each level, but you really have to mind the nazis around you or you could be killed in literally one shot.\n\nFor it's time, Wolf 3D was groundbreaking. By today's standards, it can get boring at times, but it's still as fun as I remember playing it. If you don't want to shell the 4.99 for wolf 3d, you can download the Wolfenstein 3D Total Conversion for Doom 2.","June 13, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Might I say it was quite a journey. It was pretty tough all the way up till the 9th floor on the 6th Episode. Then boy did it get out of hand... I felt like I WAS GONNA BLOW A BLOOD VESSEL. Enemy after enemy all of them back, left, right, and center expelling all of my ammo before I even got to see the final boss. If none of you have experienced this classic FPS do yourself a favor and scoop it up. You might think that this old game can't hang with a "new age" FPS player like yourself, but the controls, map layouts and enemy placement are very intentional and make for a very strong constant challenge. You can feel the amount of work that went into the map editing within the first few levels. You'll also learn that you can never relax & play this game for too long because by the time you find out you need to focus more its already too late and you rounded a blind corner with 5 S.S. soldiers and a few Officers that wipe the floor with you in an instant.\n\nSo bottom line...\n\n-Don't bust on this game because you think its too old to provide a challenge. (because you'd be wrong).\n-Even if you've never played a game like this. The game still has nostalgic qualities.\n-The sprites are very well done even for low-res characters the art and the soundtrack are very nice.\n-The elaborate map layouts are close to challenging corn mazes for their difficulty.\n-The boss fights are so satisfying.\n\nScrew you all I am giving this game a 10/10. Because it actually is perfect and I didn't find a single thing wrong.\n\n"It is so choice. If you have the means, I highly recommend picking one up."","January 12","true","14.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Blazkowicz who has been trapped deep within Castle Wolfenstein. He finds himself in a position to break free and obtains a weapon from one of the guards. From here on, he progresses through to his escape collecting any keys and nazi gold while killing any nazis he's able to come accross.\n\nIt may be a simple (and fun) game, but it was the start of something great - and it proceeded Doom. There's no denying how much fun this game is, especially towards the end of episode 6. If you are to play it, I would recommend switching the engine over to use ECWolf opposed to DOSBOX.\n\nGreat level design, fun guns, enough enemy types to keep you interested and it'll keep you buys for hours in a state of nostalgia.

Bottom line is that it is fast, fun, easy to learn and has something about it that sets it apart from the other pre-Doom first-person shooters  most of which have been - unfairly in some cases - forgotten.\n\nVisually, the game has not dated well. Many of the levels suffer being, in whole or part, repetitive mazes. Coming back to  it after so many years makes you remember quite what a huge step foreward Doom was when it first came out: sometimes I forget that I can't shoot and explode the barrels in Wolf3D.

This game is awesome, there is nothing bad that can really be said about it, it still kicks serious ♥♥♥ today.\n\nSteam version review: Well since I have only played this version, the steam version, i can't really compare that much. However, there is obviously benefits to this version! First of all, it loads up and installs pretty fast! Secondly, there is no floppy disk you have to deal with, finally, the game runs extreamly smoothly. Although, there is one complaint I have, I can't make it go back to fullscreen after existing for a moment! Besides that, this game is awesome and I would reccommend buying it on steam!\n\nOverall Game: I wasn't born for this game to come out, i was born well after it came out, but I have enjoyed it thoroughly! Even if my generation finds games like this extreamly hard (I agree with them, sometimes), this game is awesome, it is just so fun! I can see how this game and others like it made gamer's crave first-person shooters, they are even better than today's call of duty and halo franchises, in my person opinon. It takes a minute to get use to the controlls (If you are a console gamer), but it is suprisingly easy after a s hort time! I love this game, I only wish it was longer!\n\nWhat I would pay: Wait until the wolf pack drops, you can get three games for the price of one, maybe even less. I got the wolf pack at 75% off, you don't have to wait for that, but I would reccommend the wolf pack at 15.00 unless you can't take the waiting any longer.

This can be the head description of this fantastic game. The anti-nazi mentality from the Activision producers was not a common one in those days. The Cold War was over. But... it was really over?\n\nWolfenstein 3D was a big succes to the public. I'm not sure, but I can say that this game opened the wide world of gaming productions. Some of the gamers who are really obsessed with "awesome" and "cool", "realistic", graphics are disliking this kind of series for the following reasons: weak graphics, limited gameplay, too many bad guys , and so much time to finish it. However, due to the truth that lies in these kids words, i will say "Wrong!" ==> Beacuse, kids with no past, didn't had the chance to play this amazing game. And that's what you have to do to finish this game! From Nazi Guards, to Zombies, from the final boss at each chapter, to Hitler himself. (or the ghost of Hitler)\nGreat soundtrack, great gameplay, great features.\n\nWilliam Joseph "B.J." Blazkowicz, an American spy, is being caught, during a secret mission for the United States Government. As the player constrol this interesting character, Blazkowicz has to fight his way to freedom, outside the Wolfenstein castle.

There are options for mouse functionality that don't seem to work, leaving you to navigate and fight with keyboard only as you did back when this game was released.  Granted, that's the way it's meant to be played, but after a decade of a more polished experience it feels a bit clunky.  Also, there appear to be a few other hardware incompatibilites that detract from the experience.  The sound playback seems to be incompatible with modern cards, leading to weird sound glitches (go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGc6UCyuyl8 to hear what it should sound like minus the modern voice over and gun SFX, then play and decide for yourself.)  Not sure if this is something wrong with my settings or a legitimate incompatibility with either my sound card or playback devices.\n\nThis is also a straight port, not revamped in any way.\n\nTo be honest, I had more fun playing the iPhone port which is free.  However, this version gets an 8/10 overall from me for pure nostalgia value and the fact that it was (and is) an amazing game and pioneer of the FPS genre.\n\nEDIT: Not sure if they've patched this since my original review, or if the upgrade to Windows 10 is the cause, but the sound issues are much less noticeable.","September 26, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now, please be aware that I'm not judging this game harshly because it was made over 20 years ago. Do not compare this to my Global Offensive review. Let's move on: Wolfenstein 3D's controls are wacky and it's hard to play for anyone whos used to playing modern games. But I love this game. The enemies are not too overpowered and your character has the right amount of health so that its realistic. And the nice old feel to it (which wasn't old back then, of course) makes it so much better. People are so used to seeing all these perfect looking games and you never really take time to admire how nice simplicity is.

There are options for mouse functionality that don't seem to work, leaving you to navigate and fight with keyboard only as you did back when this game was released.  Granted, that's the way it's meant to be played, but after a decade of a more polished experience it feels a bit clunky.  Also, there appear to be a few other hardware incompatibilites that detract from the experience.  The sound playback seems to be incompatible with modern cards, leading to weird sound glitches (go to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGc6UCyuyl8 to hear what it should sound like minus the modern voice over and gun SFX, then play and decide for yourself.)  Not sure if this is something wrong with my settings or a legitimate incompatibility with either my sound card or playback devices.\n\nThis is also a straight port, not revamped in any way.\n\nTo be honest, I had more fun playing the iPhone port which is free.  However, this version gets an 8/10 overall from me for pure nostalgia value and the fact that it was (and is) an amazing game and pioneer of the FPS genre.\n\nEDIT: Not sure if they've patched this since my original review, or if the upgrade to Windows 10 is the cause, but the sound issues are much less noticeable.","September 26, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the game features a few tricky levels, for the most part it is smartly designed to deliver maximum Nazi killing fun. It might be old, but this game's still got some bite to it.\n\nAs one of the shooters that helped put id Software on the map, it is a piece of gaming history. And hey, it's one of the few World War 2 FPSes where you actually get to fight Adolf Hitler himself!\n\nNo checkpoints, no autosaves. Just lots of bullets and Nazis to blow away.

I am reminded that the knife is as useful as ripped condom. Then I shoot someone with a pistol. I am reminded that small caliber rounds are like cannonballs. I find my minigun only to discover that it uses the same ammo as my empty pistol. I finnd ammo in a secret wall that is magically powered by the space bar. I discover that even though they have the same ammo pool the minigun makes far bigger blood pools. I use my minigun now called sahsa to slaughter nazis. I am then shot by captain valen von ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. After blowing open holes in his stomach, I am healed by the all wonderful turkey dinner. Thank you based turkey dinner.

It is a epic game that puts you against the German army and makes you want to kill them. This a old game that can never get old. The creative levels really make you feel like you can get lost but for the most part the levels are simple. The gameplay is smooth. Just remember the code ILM, push those at the same time to get all weapons and ammo.  Its a great old fashion game that really brings me back for more!\n\n","March 30, 2011","true","15.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

During WWII as the imprisoned spy B. J. Blazkowitz you have to escape from your cell in Castle Wolfenstein by taking down all the nazis you'll encounter. That's basically the plot from the first episode of six. What can I say. It's a damn old game, running on dosbox, so a little knowledge of old systems and dosbox might help to tune it a little to prevent annoying little details, but at least it's working fine.\nI still DO NOT recommend to buy the game. Why? Because there's a free online version in the official wolfenstein site where you can play the first three episodes directly through your browser... And if you look deeper in a search engine you can find another site with all 6 episodes AND the spear of destiny expansion. It looks even more polished and plays smooth as silk, So why buying? -.-\n\n+++PROs+++ GAMEPLAY. There's not much to say, as one of the first FPS it's quite simple to understand how it works. There are still hidden walls, secret levels and of course nazi soldiers with impossible coloured suits... XD\nMUSIC.  Music is still midi, at the time it was the only alternative, but it really has an impact. Nazi or other anthems used here and there really give atmosphere, other tracks simply set the mood, other ones give adrenaline, others give suspence. One of the first works from Bobby Prince, a great work if I might say, but maybe it's just me and my nostalgia... :)---CONs--- DOSBOX. It's true, it's the only way to play it on modern PCs, but still it's hard to play smooth with default settings. You have to know it a little to tweak the emulator performance to bring it to a good state of playability (CTRL+F11 or F12 to increase/decrease the CPU Cycle)\nFREE. This game is almost 25 years old and still isn't in abandonware state but, even if it can't be considered quite "legit", you can play it online in your web browser for free. really. Even the original 6 episodes. So why buying?","February 9","false","0.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"

I didn't like it too much.\n\nI know, I'm a horrid person, aren't I?\n\nSo far, I've only played a couple of id games, and unfortunately this is the first one I didn't really enjoy. DOOM was like a blast of cocaine, and Return to Castle Wolfenstein was like a slightly less better version than Half-Life that I still appreciated. But this? Well... it's just kind of nothing.\n\nIn Wolfenstein 3D, you follow a similar pattern of old-school gaming platforms that loosely tie a story together as you go and kill more and more enemies (which in this game's case is Nazis). So, most of the issues I have instantly fall towards gameplay. I will say this though, this game has NOT aged well, especially for its controls. I spent a while reconfiguring them for mouse input, but at that point, I could move around by moving the mouse. And the A and D made you look- not strafe- right and left, which was really irritating at certain points.\n\nThe levels are pretty simple- find the key, kill the Nazis- but their structure definitely isn't. These maze-like dungeous kept me stuck for nearly 20 minutes, just trying to find my way out of one corridor, because all the hallways in this game look the same. Yes, there are deviations of color, but in those specific areas, everything looks the same! It's incredibly easy to start losing your head as you run in constant circles around the same places again and again and again...\n\nDOOM aged much easier, since it allowed actually understandable controls and gameplay that anyone could adapt to, with some relatively posh level design. Does that make Wolfenstein 3D a good foundation? Certainly. But does that make it a good game? Frankly no.","February 7","false","5.7"," 4 of 14 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","4","14","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/recommended/2270/","brainwashguy","Jefferson Davis","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brainwashguy/","158 products in account","This is going to be an odd review, for the reason that I will mostly be reviewing this game with the idea that one is playing with a mod to polish this game a little bit, as the steam version feels very blurry and dated, and makes this game feel a lot less timeless than it really is. If you end up buying this game anyway, and try the mod I recommend, it's a good idea to view this as the 2D maze-like puzzle game where you have some sort of fog-of-war, because most can relate to a retro game rather than viewing this with the same standards of call of duty. This game has one serious flaw, and it's that you almost can't play the original version that steam sells.\n\nThe mod I recommend here is called ZDOOM, and while it's for Doom, it can be used for this game with a few tweaks. Overall it makes this game feel less like it did in 1992, and gives it the polished feel of a retro game made in the 80's that everyone can play, like Mario. ZDOOM fixes polishing issues in the game, such as resolution fixes, mouse and keyboard if you wish (even though I don't recommend it), texture fixes, and overall gameplay fixes that make this game a lot more timeless while still keeping the original atmosphere. I usually strongly dislike revamping old games (for example, SkyWind makes me cringe), but this fixes key issues that make this game not fun, while stuff like SkyWind just makes the game pretty, killing its original atmosphere and feel of the game.\n\nNow that I've discussed how to be able to play this game with minimal frustrations, I'm going to be straightforward and tell you this is not a good game. I have about 15 hours off steam on this game, and based on my experiences, this game still has some serious problems that can't be fixed with something like ZDOOM. It's really obvious that this game is dated as hell, as it was the grandfather of FPS. You'd really think it's not that bad, but it is. It's a truly unplayable game when you get down to it; it's just not fun. A pros and cons list would be a good way to show this game's worth since ratings for games can be pretty subjective.\n\nPros:\n- Managable fighting mechanics, ZDOOM gives this game simple controls and easy-to-learn combat. At first I didn't enjoy keyboard controls, but this game's map design really gives an interesting idea with it. The fact that you have to turn left and right does add a bit of challenge since the devs like putting enemies on both sides, and gives strategies that also include a mix of strafing (with alt key), and add a little more extra fun to the table, and trust me, you need that extra fun.\n- Has creative map layout at points, and the maps that try to be memorable (like secret levels, bosses, and aardwolf maze) are very memorable and I could still point them out. The did some interesting choices with the actual combat itself, and gives a more fun idea of fighting that really gives strategy. Like Doom, this game is known for having some serious consequences for not thinking and responding fast, and really gives some emotion out of the game.\n- Pretty playable, it's easy to beat a chapter in a day since missions are short and the game can be not enjoyable or bad, but just generic, so you can sometimes play a lot.\n- Uses an atmosphere and a premise of why you're fighting rather than a linear story, so you can get right into the action rather than having a boring, linear game with no thought put in yourself.\n- Better mechanics than a lot of modern games (difficulty in this game has more factors for it than Skyrim, and gives some variety there)\n- There's fun in the idea that there are a lot of modders that add their own flavor to some of the maps, and create their own original weapons and maps, and it's fun to play at least a couple. I'll send one to start with at the bottom of the review.\n\nCons:\n- 4 types of enemies, most chapters don't show all at once. This really kills a lot of the fun, because it's just you doing the same thing over, and over, and over again, and I can understand that this game was made in 1992, but it just lacks polish for such a big game.\n- The normal levels really aren't memorable and it just seems like there lacks care in the level design, everything is bland and the same, and it's nothing exciting for so long.\n- Generic weapons that do the same amounts of damage and use the same ammo, just have different fire rates.\n- Can feel a bit clunky at times with movement, and looking around.\n- Overall a generic game, nothing seems exciting, and some points you just get so bored you quit and don't play the game for the rest of the day. All of the missions feel like the same thing over and over again, there's no interesting gun variety, no enemy variety, no variety for any factors in this game, even health and ammo drops are the same over and over again. I'd really say that doesn't make this game bad, but it's just not exciting. It would be different if there were a small amount of weapons but each were very unique, but each small variety of items adds nothing new to the table and feels the same as the last. If you're dealing with small variety and blandness, there's not only no content, but no fun with it, and that's just done poorly.\n\nOverall, I'd really say this game isn't terrible, but it lacks map, weapon, enemy, health, and ammo variety, and ends up feeling like the same game over and over again. I'd personally recommend this over modern day Call of Duty because they're essentially the same game; a generic game with nothing really new or exciting in it. This game is somewhat timeless with ZDOOM, but movement can feel seriously clunky at times and it's just more of "not fun" than a "dated" or "hard" game with today's standards. If you're one to enjoy FPS and don't really care about variety then this game would be playable and pretty interesting to play, especially since you can be the guy who said "I beat Wolf3D on 'I am Death Incarnate'!" like me, but really, this game is nothing more than that, a game you can say you beat as bragging rights.\n\nEDIT: After beating Doom Shareware and Doom 2, I realized that I was a little harsh on keyboard controls when I first played the game, especially since the game is 2D and it's kind of fun to use left arrow keys to turn and then use a mix of strafing. Regardless, the controls are still kind of dated, and ZDOOM is still essential for making the game feel less old, especially the blurry graphics and bad resolution, plus slow turning and all that. You have a lot of choice in what controls you want to be and generally the game's just better with ZDOOM, so still pick it up.\nAlso, as another edit, this game's map design isn't terrible, but it sure seems bad if this is the first old FPS you're playing. They have some originality, and you can tell there's some care, but overall it's not too original and not too hard. These games aren't that casual but they're not too hardcore either.\n\nhttps://www.m ediafire.com/?hjwl59bvsu9qv (Great standalone mod by Wolf Skevos-Jones)\nhttp://www.afadoomer.com/wolf3d/downloads.html (Wolf3D download for ZDOOM)\nhttp://zdoom.org/Download (ZDOOM)","August 10, 2015","false","9.2"," 3 of 14 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","3","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2270/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Wolfenstein 3D is single-player First Person Shooter that was released on PC MS-DOS in 1992. It's somewhat official sequel to Wolfenstein game for older computer, a top-down stealth game, yet W3D is neither of those. It wasn't the first FPS ever, no. Few were made before this one. It wasn't the most advanced engine-wise either, it was beaten easily by Ultima Underworld. What matter though, is that it was the first FPS that made the genre popular, as it was all about fast-paced action, running quickly and shooting everyting, exploring mazes, and not requiring a top-computer to be able to run.\nIt would then later recieve more love, get expansion pack and be ported onto consoles and other computers, with some version being inferior and Mac family ports were almost superior to DOS. Superior ports got higher resolution graphics and two additional weapons, with levels remixed. DOS only got 8-sided sprites of enemies, while other ports have 1-sided only, which doesn't matter so much in this game. Oh, and differences in soundtracks and levels too.\n\nNow, with it being quite an old game, how Steam version was handled?\nThe game itself is almost same as original DOS version and comes with all 6 episodes. The slight difference is a change of "Apogee" to "Activision", game being brought to Steam at around 2007 year. And they removed help/instructions completely for whatever reason. Probably because ordering info was beyond outdated. Thus no intro story for you.\nid software screwed up on DosBox part. It lags heavily. But you can fix it, you just have to go to game's folder and edit DosBox config file for Wolf3D, to make it run with OpenGL renderer.\n\nShame that gameplay didn't age well, but it is most eye-pleasing WW2 shooter around from colorful design side, with memorable music being upbeat or funky suspense.\n\nThe original release of the game had 3 episodes only, each having 8 normal floors, 1 boss floor and 1 secret floor:\nEscape From Castle Wolfenstein - Classic episode, which came fully with Shareware. Which was like, 1/3 or 1/6 of a game. One heck of demo.\nOperation: Eisenfaust - In this episode you explore some nasty dungeons only to find a secret entrance to nazy base. This is the only episode which has Mutant enemies, who are just plain nasties, providing a huge difficulty spike, for they are completely silent and can have zero reaction time. Good heavens they weren't used in other levels.\nDie, Furher, Die - Back to good joy again, this one introduces white officer nazis, who's only advantage is their speed. Still more fun than mutants. And in these set of levels you get to kill Hitler. Even "few". So it's awesome. And secret level is Pac-Man parody.\n\nNow, after original release, publishers figured out that id can quickly make additional 3 episodes themed after chemical war, Noctural Missions, and sell them as well. The results are 3 additional episodes that are quite meh and don't provide any new content, aside from bosses and textures:\nDark Secret - Not much to be said there, it feel like direct continuation of episode 3, having harder and more complex mazes. Though I doubt that you would more of them.\nTrail of the Madman - This is where you see id starting to tire out and their creativity starting to sink. It provides simpler mazes than Dark Secret and you can see graphical themes of rooms starting to get even less interesting.\nConfortation - This is where developers got completely tired and are going to make players tired as well. Design of levels became completely lazy. First floor has you travelling corridors that have sideways every step and you have to check every one so you will not get bulet into back. Later level layout is nothing but nazi cross repeated few times and connected with each other by doors. Final boss is quite generic and is no match for Hitler encounter.\n\nAfter choosing your episode, you have to select your difficulty out of four, all of which have phrases as name, so you wouldn't be able to guess which one is "Normal". I recommend you to pick the second to top, as it will still get difficult at the end and you will not die as much. Due to realistical/hitscan nature of enemy attacks, you often will feel that you died in a cheap way.\n\nThe game uses keyboard mostly, not exactly comfortable. Buttons it uses are arrows and right shifts, alt, ctrl, so it's kinda cluttered. It also has just one "hold this to strafe" button, so you can't circlestrafe around. Though, in this kind of FPS it would be useless. It also allows usage of mouse. Not for mouselook, nope. More as a replacament for arrows, it's used for movement. Yep, mouse back then was viewed as gimmick and not everybody knew how to make use of them.\n\nYour mission is to find exit elevator, while staying alive. To do this, you have to epxlore 1-floor maze of blocks, that are full of enemies, bonuses and doors. As well as 2 keys and locked doors. You know what to do with these. It's also littered with secret pushwalls, where you have to press "open" on a wall that you don't like and it may open, being pushed away for two blocks, revealing a secret passage. But there is no way to tell if this wall is a secret, as some of pushwalls have interesting texture while others aren't marked at all, thus creating uncertainty. Thus the only way to find them all is to hump all walls you see and that's tedius, not fun. MS-DOS version doesn't have any maps, so good luck navigating.\nThe game uses scores and lives system that feel out of place in this not-so-arcadey game. You collect many treasures to increase your score. Nope, High Score Board sure isn't going to make you compete with Steam friends, it's as usual full of blank jokeyish entries. At least it saves your score. It also has lives system, where after death you will begin level again with only pistol and if you run out of lives, you get classic game over. But because you can save and load anytime and anywhere, no one cares.\n\nThe selection of huge-pixeled (feature of DOS version, by the way) weapons that you get are simple. Way too simple, actually:\nKnife - Useless.\nPistol - Fires bullets.\nMachine Gun - Fires bullets fast.\nChaingun - Fires bullets very fast.\nYou are going to use Machine Gun all the time anyway because Chaingun eats ammo too fast, not being able to shoot just one bullet. So it's pretty poor on thinking.\n\nAnd sure thing fighting enemies if main part of game. Soldiers are preplaced on the maze, standing and sometimes patrolling around, reminding that Wolfenstein 3D was supposed to be stealth game at first, as they take extra damage if they aren't aware of you. Once they notice you or hear you, they will let out some sort of "achtung" voice and start to chase you in a direct way. Nope, their footsteps are completely silent, so on some levels you should listen to doors opening carefully. Rarely it leads to fun mouse and cat scenarios, in which fun suddenly ends by getting shot into back. Most often it means a lot of dead bodies around nearest door. Actually, most often best tactic is to come into room, give a shot and then run back behind doorway's corner, as you just sit and camp, shooting enemies one after another. Not most exciting thing.\nMain problem comes from the fact that every enemy has only hitscan-based attack. So it's a game more about camping then running out and shooting everybody in a fair fight. And it's randomized in no end, bringing quite a frustation, as each bullet may either poke you slightly or completely kill you. It all depends on distance though, same for your bullets damage. Close range is deadly.\nBoss fights are disssapointing for video game. All of them are same. Pop out, shoot until they decide to shoot back, hide.  Go to secret stack of supply if it goes bad.\n\nSo, a game that didn't age well, with cheap core gameplay. Still classic. If you want history, just play Shareware though. And if you do want full game, then only play first 3 episodes in short bursts.","February 17, 2015","false","27.5"," 8 of 26 people (31%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","31","8","26","2","4"

Till its release in 1992, no other game had fully realized how a computer screen could be our eyes into a different world.  No other game had fully realized an environment and atmosphere so immersive that players could forget they were playing a game.\n\nThat being said, Wolfenstein 3D is simply outdated.  The graphics, the sound, the controls, and gameplay are all outdated.  With exactly sixty levels, the game begins to bore after the first episode or so, especially with so few textures, enemies, weapons, etc.\n\nMy recommendation is to play Wolfenstein 3D online under Bethesda's official release.  Specifically, play the third episode and fight against the first hordes of Nazi zombies and Mecha Hitler.  id Software has released Wolfenstein: The New Order, so if you appreciate the impact the company has had on the industry, you can support them by buying that instead.\n\nGet Psyched!\n\n10/10","December 10, 2014","false","6.3"," 2 of 27 people (7%) found this review helpful","7","2","27","0","2"

Although I'm still not certain if I'd even pay four dollars for this.

It was the second video game I ever played in my life.  I started playing it when I was 3 or 4 years old and I still remember going on my dad's windows 95 computer to play it.  If you have Window's 8, like myself, and you plan on getting this you will notice it runs very slow and the sound is rather choppy.  You can fix this by downloading ECWolf and running the game with it.  Here's a link: http://maniacsvault.net/ecwolf/download.php.  Now on to the game it's self.  Wolfenstien 3-D was released by ID software on May 5th, 1992, and was considered the "Pioneer of FPS Games."  I bought it on steam just for nostalgia, and I still enjoy playing it to this day.  There's just something about blasting through waves of Nazis that feels so satisfying.  There are a good variety of enemies and bosses.  There is a story, but it's not presented to well.  There are 6 episodes, each one has a paragragh you can read about that somewhat gives you an idea about the story.  For anyone who judges a game by its graphics (I don't) you have to understand that this was made in 1992, what do you expect.  Overall, I love this game to death.   This, Super Mario World, and Doom, were the games of my childhood.","July 21, 2014","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly satisfying shooting, not a ton of weapons but when one packs a punch you can't help but smile. The strafing and mouse-look controls are not ideal and so are a little sloppy to use; though this doesn't ruin the game, it does make movement less natural (and enjoyable) for those who have been spoiled by modern control schemes. Some levels are frustratingly easy to get lost in because rooms generally look similar and there is no map. Not as timeless as the Doom series but classic, interesting, and fun.

The default controls for this game are the arrow keys and you can't set the controls to use WASD to move and strafe. The program 'EC Wolf" has this option and is the highly recommended way to play the game. It also can upscale the game into HD graphics which look nicer. Another problem with this game is that it lags which shouldn't happen on any modern computer. EC Wolf also addresses this problem.

It is incredibly tough, but not unfairly so- all the resources you need are in the level, with yet more hidden. Level design is a bit archaic- at times it's really just a maze, and the samey wall textures don't help- but learning the maps, finding secrets and paying attention to your surroundings will reward you greatly. Enemy soldiers are unforgiving and have very fast reaction times that you will have to beat to survive, and at times there will be very many of them. It simply has to be played on the highest difficulty.\n\nIt is an FPS stripped down all the way, demanding from you only raw determination and skill. It's not as brilliantly designed as Doom, nor as clever and intuitive as Quake, but Wolfenstein 3D is still a very worthy member of id Software's trinity of shooters and a classic in its own right.\n\nBy the way, the game comes packed with Dosbox on Steam. Dosbox sucks. Download ECwolf, copy the contents of the ECwolf folder to the folder named "base" in the Wolf3d directory, delete dosbox.exe, and rename ecwolf.exe to dosbox. Tweak your resolution and controls in the settings, and you're good to go.","July 26, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One of the many reasons I ended up working with computers for a living. For the fellow 80's babies you might have fond memories of asking your step dad to play this on his Packard Bell (if I remember correctly) and watched eagerly as he stuck that old 5 inch floppy in the desktop the monitor was resting on and typing in those DOS commands and letting me enjoy. At first when I bought this in the Wolf pack I kind of chuckled at the small size of it, then I thought about it, if you get into emulation as I do then you know how large in MB those old Nintendo game rom files are and this old DOS game is about the size of the smallest N64 games were MANY years later, shows how advanced computers were even back then compared to consoles. This along with the original Alone in the Dark are 2 of the first games I remember playing and it is worth a couple bucks to relive those memories.","January 1, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although this wasn't the first FPS, it was the first blockbuster hit that really established the FPS as a genre. However, the game doesn't hold up very well today.\n\nWolfenstein 3D is fun, but also very frustrating. Here are a few problems. 1) The controls are so atrocious that the game is practically unplayable, but a source port program like ECWolf can be used to update the control scheme. 2) The layout of levels is sprawling, and the blocky and repetitive architecture give most levels an annoying maze-like feel. 3) The game is weird with corners, meaning that sometimes enemies can see and shoot you around a corner, but you can't see them. 4) The mutant enemy type will often shoot you instantaneously on sight, without you having time to react. 5) There are only a few types of weapons and enemies, and combat quickly becomes repetitive. 6) The built-in auto-aim can be clunky and unreliable.\n\nUltimately, I recommend Wolfenstein 3D because it is still fun to play despite its many failings, which admittedly will keep some FPS fans from enjoying it. My advice is to play it with the ECWolf source port (or another like it), and to enjoy the game in small doses, playing a level or two per day so that it won't become tedious. If you want some nostalgia and can appreciate an older game in spite of its limitations, then Wolfenstein 3D is a good buy.","May 2, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Surprisingly satisfying shooting, not a ton of weapons but when one packs a punch you can't help but smile. The strafing and mouse-look controls are not ideal and so are a little sloppy to use; though this doesn't ruin the game, it does make movement less natural (and enjoyable) for those who have been spoiled by modern control schemes. Some levels are frustratingly easy to get lost in because rooms generally look similar and there is no map. Not as timeless as the Doom series but classic, interesting, and fun.

Many, incudling myself, would say that this game helped establish the First Person Shooter genre. Why would we, in 2015 (as of writing), want to play a 23 year old relic of gaming past? Well, it's because despite its age, and its primitive appearance, everything that makes the genre what we know it to be today is here. After all, this is the blueprint to the FPS genre. The gameplay is here, and there's a certain freedom that this and many games like it have that more modern games seem to lack. Sure, as I said before, the graphics are dated and it looks like a mess someone drew in MS Paint compared to pretty much anything since then. Sure, the voice samples are goofy when guards see you and yell in broken German and let out death cries ranging from cringeworthy to gut bustingly hilarious, but that's part of its charm. Wolfenstein 3d is a game that doesn't take itself to seriously and doesn't expect you to either. So, as inexpensive as it is to have one of the most vital pieces of gaming history to enjoy for yourself, you would be kind of silly not to get it and try it at least once.","March 24, 2015","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is fantastic and I can complain about the rest! The only gripe I have with this game is DOSBox. The Steam version runs the original MS-DOS version of the game in the DOSBox emulator. This causes the game to be very laggy and run at a very low resolution. I would HIGHLY reccomend that you buy this then download ECWolf (Great source port of Wolf3D) and play it in that!

Often mistaken as the first game to utilize the concept of a shooter game in first person perspective for gameplay as oppose to third person perspective. However the first first person shooter games were the 1974 "Maze War" & "Spasim". Anyways Wolfenstein 3D is the third game in the Wolfenstein franchise, the first two were the 1981 "Castle Wolfenstein" & the 1984 "Beyond Castle Wolfenstein". For this game it dropped the word "castle" and added "3-D" at the end. Making games in a 3-D perspective was still a primative attempt for game developers back then, something that is common to see in games today, but back then gamers were amazed to play through levels that felt like going through actual rooms. The plot is very basic, you assumed the role of an American Polish WW2 soldier named  William "B.J." Blazkowicz who must escape a castle conterted into a prison called Castle Wolfenstein that's heavily occupied by SS officiers. B.J. must kill various enemies in order to escape the castle alive. The release of this game has inspired various future first person shooter games and even provided inspiration for various war genre games. Wolfenstein is an important piece of gaming history that all gamers should experience. It's a fun and rewarding experience with various weapons and treasure to collect in various floors of Nazi occupied headquarters.","February 11","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Another problem with this game is that it lags which shouldn't happen on any modern computer. EC Wolf also addresses this problem.

Do I think its good well...\n\nYes and no.\n\nFirst things first this port is crap. Its just a DOSbox shell which would be fine, but the configuration is absolute garbage. You have to do a lot of DOSBOX config changes before the game is even playable.\n\nAfter that you are left with a game that is fun, but only in short bursts. That isn't really a knock against the game as a whole because it was one of the earlist FPS games ever made, but rather a warning to you if you choose to buy it.\n\nWolfenstein 3D has a lot of flaws in 2015 that weren't really apparent back in 1992. The levels are repetetive mazes that are easy to get lost in and theres no map which worsens the issue. The controls by default are clunky and hard to use (though this is fixable but not on this release alone, a source port will fix this) the game is unfairly difficult, the list goes on.\n\nBut its still a really FUN game.\n\nThe shooting is very fun and the 3 guns that you get in the game are all fun to use. Especially the chaingun with its loud sounds and sheer power. Killing things is really fun in this game thanks to great sound effects, good hit detection and good animation. The game is fun, but it hasn't exactly aged well, but if you can tolerate its problems Wolfenstein 3D is still a fun game. If anything you should buy for its historical importance.\n\nThe visuals are basic, no surprise there, but they don't look bad. The sprites are very detailed and the textures look good. The textures do tend to repeat and the levels are complex in design but basic in look. There are no multileveled floors, the levels are flat and static, but again this game was released in 1992 so its okay.\n\nThe music is really good, I love that twangy Sound Blaster\Adlib sound that many DOS games had at the time and this is no exception. The sound effects are also good.\n\nOverall I recommend this game only if you know if you are getting into. You have to know how to tweak the DOSbox config file before starting (unless you get a source port) and this game does have a lot of flaws by todays standards, but its historically important and for that reason alone you should give Wolfenstein 3D a try,","July 3, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brothersorg/recommended/2270/","brothersorg","Brother Sorg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brothersorg/","709 products in account","Wolfenstein 3D. A first-person action game developed by id Software in 1994. This game is often known as one of the pioneers for the First Person Shooter genre, pushing it towards what it has become today. It drew inspiration from the old 1980’s Castle Wolfenstein games. Wolfenstein 3D put players in the first person perspective and let you run around several levels, shooting Nazis.\n\nWolfenstein 3D was originally developed for Dos PCs. Back in the day it used the common shareware marketing model that let people play the first episode for free. It has since been re-released and ported to several gaming systems and mobile platforms.\n\n-Story\nAs with alot of action games at the time, Wolfenstein 3D had a very simple story. You play as William Blazkowicz as you try to take down the Nazi regime. The original game was split up into 3 episodes, having the player work their way through a series of levels, wandering through buildings and caves as you shoot at Nazis, Dogs and Zombies. You had simple goals like escaping a prison, foiling the Regime's plans, and coming to a final confrontation with the Fuhrer himself.\n\nLater releases included the three episode prequel, the Nocturnal Missions, that dealt with German plans for chemical warfare. A Standalone Expansion, The Spear of Destiny, was also a prequel that tasked the player with reclaiming the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis.\n\n-Design:\nAs a First Person Action Shooter that was developed in the early 90’s, the graphics may be primitive by today's standards, but back in the day compared to other 3D games of the time, the 3d walls and sprites combined with the faster movement blew minds away. Castle and cave walls made up most of the environment that were littered with sprites of furniture, water puddles and enemies. While there is a lot of Nazi imagery in the game, later versions had some alterations such as removing swastikas due to controversy.\n\nThe game is divided up into episodes consisting of 9 levels each, as well as a secret level to find. Level design was quite extravagant with several branching paths. It was often like a maze as you tried to find the exit door, coming across some doors that required special keys you needed to find. There are also several secrets hidden throughout, usually behind pushwalls,  with goodies such as gold, ammo, health and sometimes a new weapon. Spear of destiny broke from the episode format by just having a series of 18 levels split into four sections, each ending with a boss.\n\nGameplay wise, it was a good advancement from other first person titles at the time. For several players tho, the controls may be hard to get used to, with the key configuration being a little awkward. If you want a better experience, I suggest installing a 3rd party engine such as ECWolf, which will allow modern key configuration and higher resolutions. If you prefer to use a controller, the XBLA and PSN versions will work as you expect.\n\n-Verdict:\nWolfenstein 3D is a nice piece of gaming history that put the FPS genre in the direction that it ended up in today. If you can look past the primitive graphics and like to get to know where shooters came from, it is a great buy for $5 on Steam, XBLA and PSN. Or if you need a nice diversion while you're out, $2 on the iTunes app store.\n\n\n\n3rd Party Engine:\nECWolf: http://maniacsvault.net/ecwolf/\n","July 7, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is incredibly tough, but not unfairly so- all the resources you need are in the level, with yet more hidden. Level design is a bit archaic- at times it's really just a maze, and the samey wall textures don't help- but learning the maps, finding secrets and paying attention to your surroundings will reward you greatly. Enemy soldiers are unforgiving and have very fast reaction times that you will have to beat to survive, and at times there will be very many of them. It simply has to be played on the highest difficulty.\n\nIt is an FPS stripped down all the way, demanding from you only raw determination and skill. It's not as brilliantly designed as Doom, nor as clever and intuitive as Quake, but Wolfenstein 3D is still a very worthy member of id Software's trinity of shooters and a classic in its own right.\n\nBy the way, the game comes packed with Dosbox on Steam. Dosbox sucks. Download ECwolf, copy the contents of the ECwolf folder to the folder named "base" in the Wolf3d directory, delete dosbox.exe, and rename ecwolf.exe to dosbox. Tweak your resolution and controls in the settings, and you're good to go.","July 26, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Often mistaken as the first game to utilize the concept of a shooter game in first person perspective for gameplay as oppose to third person perspective. However the first first person shooter games were the 1974 "Maze War" & "Spasim". Anyways Wolfenstein 3D is the third game in the Wolfenstein franchise, the first two were the 1981 "Castle Wolfenstein" & the 1984 "Beyond Castle Wolfenstein". For this game it dropped the word "castle" and added "3-D" at the end. Making games in a 3-D perspective was still a primative attempt for game developers back then, something that is common to see in games today, but back then gamers were amazed to play through levels that felt like going through actual rooms. The plot is very basic, you assumed the role of an American Polish WW2 soldier named  William "B.J." Blazkowicz who must escape a castle conterted into a prison called Castle Wolfenstein that's heavily occupied by SS officiers. B.J. must kill various enemies in order to escape the castle alive. The release of this game has inspired various future first person shooter games and even provided inspiration for various war genre games. Wolfenstein is an important piece of gaming history that all gamers should experience. It's a fun and rewarding experience with various weapons and treasure to collect in various floors of Nazi occupied headquarters.","February 11","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A first-person action game developed by id Software in 1994. This game is often known as one of the pioneers for the First Person Shooter genre, pushing it towards what it has become today. It drew inspiration from the old 1980’s Castle Wolfenstein games. Wolfenstein 3D put players in the first person perspective and let you run around several levels, shooting Nazis.\n\nWolfenstein 3D was originally developed for Dos PCs. Back in the day it used the common shareware marketing model that let people play the first episode for free. It has since been re-released and ported to several gaming systems and mobile platforms.\n\n-Story\nAs with alot of action games at the time, Wolfenstein 3D had a very simple story. You play as William Blazkowicz as you try to take down the Nazi regime. The original game was split up into 3 episodes, having the player work their way through a series of levels, wandering through buildings and caves as you shoot at Nazis, Dogs and Zombies. You had simple goals like escaping a prison, foiling the Regime's plans, and coming to a final confrontation with the Fuhrer himself.\n\nLater releases included the three episode prequel, the Nocturnal Missions, that dealt with German plans for chemical warfare. A Standalone Expansion, The Spear of Destiny, was also a prequel that tasked the player with reclaiming the Spear of Destiny from the Nazis.\n\n-Design:\nAs a First Person Action Shooter that was developed in the early 90’s, the graphics may be primitive by today's standards, but back in the day compared to other 3D games of the time, the 3d walls and sprites combined with the faster movement blew minds away. Castle and cave walls made up most of the environment that were littered with sprites of furniture, water puddles and enemies. While there is a lot of Nazi imagery in the game, later versions had some alterations such as removing swastikas due to controversy.\n\nThe game is divided up into episodes consisting of 9 levels each, as well as a secret level to find. Level design was quite extravagant with several branching paths. It was often like a maze as you tried to find the exit door, coming across some doors that required special keys you needed to find. There are also several secrets hidden throughout, usually behind pushwalls,  with goodies such as gold, ammo, health and sometimes a new weapon. Spear of destiny broke from the episode format by just having a series of 18 levels split into four sections, each ending with a boss.\n\nGameplay wise, it was a good advancement from other first person titles at the time. For several players tho, the controls may be hard to get used to, with the key configuration being a little awkward. If you want a better experience, I suggest installing a 3rd party engine such as ECWolf, which will allow modern key configuration and higher resolutions. If you prefer to use a controller, the XBLA and PSN versions will work as you expect.\n\n-Verdict:\nWolfenstein 3D is a nice piece of gaming history that put the FPS genre in the direction that it ended up in today. If you can look past the primitive graphics and like to get to know where shooters came from, it is a great buy for $5 on Steam, XBLA and PSN. Or if you need a nice diversion while you're out, $2 on the iTunes app store.\n\n\n\n3rd Party Engine:\nECWolf: http://maniacsvault.net/ecwolf/\n","July 7, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is incredibly tough, but not unfairly so- all the resources you need are in the level, with yet more hidden. Level design is a bit archaic- at times it's really just a maze, and the samey wall textures don't help- but learning the maps, finding secrets and paying attention to your surroundings will reward you greatly. Enemy soldiers are unforgiving and have very fast reaction times that you will have to beat to survive, and at times there will be very many of them. It simply has to be played on the highest difficulty.\n\nIt is an FPS stripped down all the way, demanding from you only raw determination and skill. It's not as brilliantly designed as Doom, nor as clever and intuitive as Quake, but Wolfenstein 3D is still a very worthy member of id Software's trinity of shooters and a classic in its own right.\n\nBy the way, the game comes packed with Dosbox on Steam. Dosbox sucks. Download ECwolf, copy the contents of the ECwolf folder to the folder named "base" in the Wolf3d directory, delete dosbox.exe, and rename ecwolf.exe to dosbox. Tweak your resolution and controls in the settings, and you're good to go.","July 26, 2015","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/2270/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","For as far as shooters have come, they can still be boiled down to their fundamentals. Shooting and navigating levels. Wolfenstein 3D set the groundwork for a genre that hasn't ceased being the most popular in the world. If you enjoy shooters in any capacity, you owe it to Wolfenstein 3D for popularizing them.\n\nDoes the game hold up in the modern era? Yes and no. No in that it's incredibly simplistic. It's nice to have something with such a clear goal, but playing through a single episode is all it takes to see the entirety of Wolfenstein 3D's bag of tricks. Other than different boss characters and one new enemy, you can fully understand this game in about 30 minutes.\n\nThe level designs start off fairly obtuse, but get refined as the game progresses. The prequel episodes, for instance, are very concise and fast. Things are laid out in a more logical fashion and the levels don't take more than 5 minutes (save for a few agonizing levels in Episode 6). The earlier levels suffer from being sprawling and lacking definition in their textures.\n\nThe weapons are definitely limited, but it's cool to have everything utilize the same ammo. Whatever weapon you decide to go with is more like an optional challenge than anything. Trying to knife everyone may be futile, but it can be done. Getting that gattling gun is like putting the game on Easy mode, so it's hard to not default to it.\n\nAs for the boss battles, they range from hilariously easy to pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The first boss is a push over (and he comes back for Episode 5), but taking on Hitler is a different story. He has hit-scan weapons that basically hit you with 100% accuracy. He also has floating magicians and a second form. It's insane.\n\nSome of the levels are also overloaded with enemies. You start off with basically a pistol and have no possible way to take them on, unless you are astute enough to find the secrets. Secrets were basically half the game back in the day, so it's not hard to understand why valuable items were placed there.\n\nWhat isn't acceptable is how some necessary keys and a few exits are stuck behind "secrets". That is just cruel. I guess level design standards were more based on finding secrets back in 1992, but it doesn't hold up well.\n\nIn every other regard, though, Wolfenstein 3D is solid. It was a groundbreaking game back in it's time and it still remains a rather fun and glorious romp through Hitler's castle. ID Software would later perfect the formula with Doom, but it's always cool to see where things began.\n\n7/10","May 24","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
