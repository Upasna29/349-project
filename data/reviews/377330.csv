"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/recommended/377330/","RPINerd","RPINerd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RPINerd/","470 products in account","Dear [Insert horror game developer],\n\nTHIS is how I like my horror.\n\nI received a good deal of flak for my (I admit) petty review of the Amnesia series of games, and while I understand that they were useless reviews, Close Your Eyes showed me exactly what I wanted to say about them but never knew I was looking for.\n\nI wanted to love the amnesia series so much; I think a lot of horror games have some beautiful narratives hidden inside them, but they are all unplayable. You can call me a chicken or whatever you like, but jump scares are NOT fun. They are NOT horror. All they are is an involuntary reflex forced upon us by extreme stimuli. True horror makes you uncomfortable, afraid, uneasy and anxious. Sure you may jump sometimes but it’s because you did it to yourself. The game didn’t flash a light in your eyes and accompany it with a blood curdling snarl, no, the atmosphere puts you into a very unsafe place mentally and you begin to see and anticipate things on your own. This is what Close Your Eyes nails; I want so much more of this on the market that I don’t even know how to express myself. From the very beginning I was uneasy, the world was dark and simplistic, my mind filled in details that may or may not have even been there. The sound design and voice acting was chilling and spot on, causing countless chills and rushing adrenaline. Everything done in this game felt deliberate and calculated, not once did the developer cash in and sacrifice atmosphere and narrative for a PewDieBait jump scare. Nor did it need to. Much like the outstanding Point and Click game “The Cat Lady”, Close Your Eyes masterfully brings you into a very dark place and lets your mind take care of the rest - cruelly prodding it along with snippets of story and hints of progression.\n\nClose Your Eyes is one of the best horror experiences I’ve had in recent memory. And as if I can’t praise it enough, it’s FREE. There is no reason (outside of mature content concerns) that anyone should pass up on a chance to experience this game. Bravo, Developers, bravo.","September 27, 2015","true","2.1"," 63 of 65 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","63","65","0","0"

Even after playing these last 3\nhours, I still didn't get all the endings.

They fit perfectly into the sceneries. Some of them make you feel very uncomfortable while others pretty much sooth your soul. They were chosen wisely and make the game feel deeper, darker.\n\nThere is little to nothing that I disliked. I only noticed some funny typos xD, but those weren't bad.

I honestly didn't think it would be very good, due to the grapics, but I turned out to be very wrong. This game was also very strange, and I will say, this game is not suited for children. It was very ♥♥♥♥ed up, I wont, lie, but it was very enjoyable. It has strong sexual innuendo's, and very inapropriate dialogue that was.. Descriptive. If any of you are triggered by death, blood, sitophilia, murder, hanging, ♥♥♥♥, seven deadly sins for all those religious folks out there, paranormal beings, gore, creepy music, jumpscares, close-to necrophilia, and mass-murder or sacrifice, you probably shouldn't play this game.\n\nThe puzzles in this game were surely difficult, and had your mind running. The characters in this game were a lot of fun to see develop as the game went along. The music that went along with this game surely did a great job of keeping you on the edge. It created a very nice ambience.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I suggest you play it, as well!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/squatta/recommended/377330/","squatta","Squatta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/squatta/","463 products in account","I feel like this could be a horror game gem, just like other RPG Maker horror-themed games like Yume Nikki and Ib.\nClose Your Eyes centers around a character who escapes from death row. As you play the game you will have to solve a few puzzles, and along the way, more and more of the story gets revealed as to who this character is and why they were to be executed. Accompanied by haunting visuals and a constant air of suspense, a pretty disturbing and creepy story unfolds\n\nThe game has a unique art style, which seems 100% original instead of using RPG Maker's preset tiles, etc. It might not be highly detailed or not even to everyone's taste, but I felt like the childlike style of drawings and the even cutesy appearance of the main character just added to the scariness of the game. There are also multiple endings so your experience doesn't necessarily end once you finish the game the first time.\n\nPeople might underestimate the capabilites RPG Maker games have, but if done right, you can be as emersed in them as any triple A horror title. This game sets up the atmosphere excellently. The ambience and visual are done incredibly well - enough to give you the feeling of being on edge. And it does a great job of luring you into a sense of relaxation during parts that aren't so suspenseful. The sound is also great as well as the voice acting. The Host has some chilling dailogue that is only enhanced by his haunting voice.\n\nThis game has jump scares, but they hardly ever felt cheap. A lot of the time they are built up to - you know they'll happen and thats what makes it worse. And there were hardly any parts too difficult that might break the atmosphere of the game (sans a chase scene that might get a little frustrating until you figure it out).\n\nOverall, I very highly recommend this game if you're looking for a unique horror experience. And best of all - it's free. If you are a fan, like me, of RPG Maker horror-themed games like Ib (which I feel this game is at least somewhat influenced by), Yume Nikki, .flow, Space Funeral, or even the Witch's House and Off, I urge you even more to give this game a try.\n\nAnd make sure to play with dim lighting, headphones, and in full screen or at least large windowed mode for best effect!","September 20, 2015","true","6.0"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

Close Your Eyes is much more sinister than that, and it will slowly work its way under your skin and stay with you even after you've finished playing. The artwork is deceptively child-like and disturbingly psychedlic, helping to add to the overall style of the game itself. The puzzles are fun and challenging, sometimes nearly to the point of frustration (especially towards the end). It's always been interesting for me to experience a game through the perspective of an antagonist, to see the world through the eyes of a madman, and this game delivers. Every character introduced is interesting and mysterious in their own way, and I absolutely love the way sound and music help to add to the gameplay. The voice-acting in the game is very well done.  Although there is a good dose of dark humor mixed in, the themes of the story are very heavy and mature.  There's quite a bit of replay value as well, considering the multiple endings and various different routes of gameplay. Overall I was amazed and inspired by this game. You'll be hard-pressed to find another free-to-play game here that has this much depth to it.

Just a bit.\nAgewise, I DEFINITELY DO NOT RECOMMEND for little ones... the visuals are kinda gory, not completely horrible, but beyond that, I think the themes are what make it much worse. Multiple sexual references, though not visual or audible in any way, are apart of the game. ♥♥♥♥ is a topic mentioned on more than one occasion during this game. This might be just fine for you as a mature person, but if your kid asks to play this game and they're like, ten years old, personally, I would redirect them to a different game, (if it has to be a horror RPG, go with Ib.)\nI like the style of the game. As usual, I'm a huge fan of Horror RPGMaker lookin' games, so this was kinda right up my alley in that department. This one is pretty unnerving though. It takes a lot to get me freaked out about a game, but I will admit, I've jumped multiple times and nearly fell out of my seat, as well as felt completely disgusted on more than one occasion. But the theme is... definitely interesting, kinda confusing, unique... The puzzles are a bit harder than Ib or Misao or The Witch's House. There is one glitch I've found in the game involving finding the boy. It ran a bit slow on my computer (but probably won't for others), but other than that, I haven't found too many problems with the actual game itself. DEFINITELY wear headphones while playing. Just do it. It is so much cooler with the headphones on, it has that sorta ASMR kinda feel to it.\nThere are several possible endings and outcomes I've noticed, and not all seem to be... finishable. I love all of the discussion I've read about the game, all the theories and whatnot... I enjoy it.\n\nAfter finishing the game, going down several possible routes, and reading multiple reviews and theories, I've decided that although the idea is interesting, the plot is just too sickly disturbing for my /personal/ tastes. I've played quite a few horror RPG games, but this one is by far the darkest I've played. BUT.... it is still a very, very good game.\n\nIf you liked Ib, The Witch's House, or Misao, and are searching for something darker, more sinister, and more for "grown ups," you might like this game. Not for the faint of heart.","September 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It was a bit of a new experience because I'd gotten stuck a few times with the challenging puzzles, and because this is a new version, there aren't walkthroughs and let's plays to find out what to do, so I actually had to figure them out myself, and that was interesting. (No, I didn't spend an hour and a half in a graveyard, moaning about how stupid I am and how much I wanted to find my stalker as I tried random combinations of lights, what are you talking about?)\n\nI rejoiced when I found out it wasn't a first person game (I'm not a huge fan of first person horror... even though most horror seems to be first person). The graphics are a bit nostalgic, and I love the artwork. I took a lot of screenshots of the artwork (some are very disturbing). There are a couple of jump scares (very few), and a few times where you're being chased by something (god, I hate those). The audio is terrifying. Sometimes there's calm music that lets your guard down, sometimes there's breathing, sometimes there's random loud noises and god, I hate it and love it at the same time.\n\nI'm probably going to play this game until I find all seven of the endings, because this game is just fantastic. I reccomend it to everyone that loves horror because it's amazing. It's definitely the best free game I've ever played. I'm seriously enjoying it a lot. There are more mysteries in this game to find, and I can't wait to find them.","September 3, 2015","true","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I never finished the game because I reached a puzzel that was just too tedious, and it was not worth finishing.\nOverall, I mean I guess it's free. But if your time is worth anything to you, find something better to spend it on.","September 6, 2015","false","1.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I mean, obviously it's part of the story, but hey, I know that there are seven whole endings for a fact.\n\nThis is a pretty short game, and you can beat it within about 2 hours, but it's FREE, so you'd have no right to complain about it being too short unless you just hate on these kinds of games. Now, I'll be honest, I do that sometimes. A game that looks like this are types that I immediately assume are like Final Fantasy, where you need to farm levels in order to play the game efficiently. But no, this isn't like that. This is just about one creepy little marshmallow trying to get back to his lost love, I guess. Again, the ending I got, and the events that let to said ending, was probably my own experince ^-^\n\n\nThe game plays VERY well and the controls are crazy simplistic. You use your arrow keys to move, which is different, but you could use your number pad as well, if you preferred. The puzzles are pretty tricky, too. Remember when I said you could beat this in under 2 hours, maybe. It took about two and a half for me because I got so stuck on the very first puzzle. And the second one (only two, sadly) was so hard that I just decided to look through the developer's comments to find out the answer. I'm a little slow, I know x3\n\nAll in all, Close Your Eyes features spooks galore if you're playing it right. "Do not rob yourself of the experience. Use headphones in a dark room, alone," is what it advises of you, so please do it.

I know I don't swear; but let me explain, a word like that can only describe the simplistic excellence this game achieves in my opinion. I have been waiting for a longer multi-ending storyline game since I finished the Stanley Parable. This game has restored my faith in video game storylines; I have been aching for a story like this. I loved this game so much it prompted me to write a review (which I haven't done in ages). It was perfect; it has a great story, puzzles, 7 different endings, a slight horror aspect, YET RETAINS THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF GAMEPLAY (Which lately storyline games have LOST the ability to keep). All of the endings take at least 3 hours to complete, however so far I have only found one. Another great aspect: its price, absolutely free (but honestly I would pay money for it if it improved its art)(and its DLC), speaking of art for you graphics buffs: LAY OFF for god’s sake there hasn't been a game like this in AGES so disregard the art. I loved this title, and would love to see a soundtrack released. Not to mention provided me with sufficient nostalgia; memories of bouncing around in an overhead third person game in black and white are thrust back to mind.","September 7, 2015","true","3.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It feels like inspiration was taken from Silent Hill in the enviroment sounds that give the creep factor. The story seems interesting, but, personally I was lost, as I really found it hard to actually realise who was who and what was going on.\nThe Puzzles are well designed, but some were a little too hard or weren't clear, which did let it down slightly. Voice overs were done well, and really captured the character.\nHowever, as great as this game is, there are faults. The game starts off well, but soon becomes a crawl through dark corridoors searching for keys to more keys that unlock doors to MORE keys. This could have worked well, but, between these points, it seemed empty. As the game progresses, it just seemed to become more and more tangled. The story stopped making much sense, and I soon wondered why I was wandering so many surreal areas.\nNow, I did quit the game at the Valerie Maze, but, deciding I wouldn't be beaten, I went back, and I have to say, I was impressed. The game still doesn't make a whole lot of sense to me, but I think I have a vauge idea of what happened/is happening. The multiple endings to be found are a nice touch, but again, they just confused me slightly. I certainly hope there will be a sequel to this game!","September 3, 2015","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This was not the case with Close Your Eyes, a nifty indie horror title that, for the amazing price of $0.00, can really hook you in and give you goosebumps down your spine right until the very end!\n\nStory: You play as an otherwise unnamed person refered to as 'Marshmallow Monk' that has luckily escaped Death Row. Why were you on death row? Because you're a murderer. As you descend through the subway that leads away from Death Row, you'll begin to realize things are not as they seem, and the events unfolding are somehow connected to you, two females, and a green man simply known as "The Host", who occasionally gives you questions to answer throughout. Another being seems to leave behind written messages for you who goes by the name of Simon, although it's unclear who Simon actually is, only that Simon wants to be with you...\n\nPresentation: Horror relies on one thing to truly be successful - Atmosphere. throughout the journey, the game, despite looking like a crude sprite-based RPG you might find on the old NES, the sounds, music, and lighting mix together beautifully, creating a sense of dread and oppression. Much like with novels, graphics aren't needed to give you a horrific experience, if the atmosphere is established correctly.\n\nGameplay: The game clearly uses an RPG maker engine of sorts, with save points, items to collect and use, and puzzles here and there. However, there is no leveling, no real enemies to kill (although that isn't to say you don't kill, you murderer!), and no need to worry losing a lot of time due to a silly mistake. Save points are generously placed throughout and encounters with actual enemies play out akin to simple games of keep-away; you get caught, and it's instantly game over. Despite the enemies, the game's length is short, yet deceptive, as not only does it contain multiple endings, but the endings can occur at different points in the full length of the game, yet one thing ties them together: Your choices.\n\nSo, if horror is your thing (and it's normally not mine!), ask yourself this: Will you close your eyes, or will you keep them open and stare into the abyss of your sins? Remember, for while you stare into the abyss, it stares back at you.\n","September 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I didnt want to leave my seat all throughout, it has a compelling mystery you need to figure out, and a very eerie, haunting soundtrack. The graphics are obviously not supposed to be the greatest as the engine they are on doesn't really do that, however the artwork featured in the game, the clever puzzles, and the overall amazing attention to detail, combined with the aforementioned soundtrack, and you have a game that can't go wrong. If you're into other 2d horror games like Misao, Ib, the like, then you're in the right place, but be warned, this game is VERY atmospheric and dark, so if you aren't ready to feel eyes peering at you while you play, or if you aren't comfortable with some... Odd, things that happen in gaming, you will have your pants scared off.","September 30, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Close Your Eyes doesn't rely on a lot of jump scares. Rather, I found that the experience got under my skin with the creepy, unsettling atmosphere that builds up. The art style works well, along with impressive voice acting and sound design.\n\nI must say one or two of the puzzles got in the way of immersion for me - for example, there's a puzzle to do with train doors that meant I had to take off my headphones to turn on a light and fetch pen and paper in order to solve it (taking me out of both the darkness and the game for a while!).\n\nBut on the whole, I'd definitely recommend this, especially as it's a free game.

There are POSSIBLE SPOILERS in this review, but I will hide them.\n\nUPDATED 3/28/16 [I finished the game]\n\nPROS\n-Price: This game is FREE\n-Voice Acting: While it's a bit sparse, the voice acting that is present is very well done.\n-Tone/Mood: The atmosphere of the game is extremely dark, and lends itself well to the overall story that is being presented to us. Dialogue also gives off an eerie feeling.\n-Story: I don't think I've ever come across a game like CYE before. It has a unique premise that lends itself to the horror genre.\n-Style: Jesus the art in this game gave me the creeps. And that's a very good thing! The game's art sucks you into the story and the overall atmosphere of the game. My favorite thing about this game so far is the sparse lighting. Having everything very dimly lit sets the tone and sucks you into the story even more.\n-Protagonist: Even though our protagonist (the death row inmate) rarely speaks, I really like him. The game is so well done that you can actually feel yourself sympathizing with a murderer. (Also, he's a cute little bouncy thing. Who could resist?)\n-Antagonist: GOD YES. The Host and Simon are wondefully done characters who served their purposes well. Simon, especially -- any scene involving him gave me chills.\n-Other Characters: The Girl and The Girl in Yellow were wonderful, unforgettable characters who enhanced the story.\n-Ambient Sounds: Beautiful, eerie, and haunting soundtrack that made me shiver at several points when playing.\n\nCONS\n-Soundtrack: I only had 1 problem with the soundtrack but for me, it was relatively major. There are a few scenes that involve a character called The Girl that are supposed to be beautiful and emotional but had the cheesiest music EVER behind them. I would have enjoyed the scene had there not been cheesy music in the background. I love the rest of the music so far, being ambient and without vocals. But the music with vocals -- especially being such a cheesy song -- really took me out of the game.\n\nOverall, I would give Close Your Eyes a 94/100. It is most definitely worth a try!","March 11","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was a very entertaining experience. The game exudes a palpable creepiness, a tone maintained throughout the duration of the game. I found the subject matter a bit unsettling compared to normal horror games, as it was skirting about the "in real life" horror of murder, as opposed to the usual full on supernatural/scifi horror. Other than the interesting static art displayed every now and then during gameplay, graphics are a bit ♥♥♥♥, but I feel it adds to the creepy charm of the title; I am unsure if the game would have maintained its unsettling atmosphere if it had juicy sprites and set pieces (or maybe it could, I don't know, but it's free so it doesn't really matter). The sound was a bit inconsistent with loudness levels; I had trouble hearing certain sections of dialogue and on other times it was sometimes too loud. Control works well with gamepad, though movement feels less fluid than I find comfortable.\n\nIn summary, it was a fun, interesting, atmospheric experience that - despite a few teensy niggles - was very much worth the download and time expended. I'm looking forward to the next game from this developer.","March 26","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/recommended/377330/","cakes1","ʕგҚვֆ","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cakes1/","1174 products in account","Close Your Eyes starts out slow and plays out slow, it's very visually unappealing, almost to the point where the art itself would turn me away from the game. But I decided to stick through it given the fact this has such decent ratings on Steam. I'm glad I stuck with it, the game itself is very creepy (sketchy is probably a better word), strays away from jumpscares for the most part, and really establishes an atmosphere pretty quickly.\n\nPersonally I hardly hold this up on a pedestal like many others that have played it; it's good, but it's not that good, if I were to give it a proficiency title I'd probably call it "unrefined". The story and idea behind the game is creative and solid, which I suppose it has to be because this is all it's pushing it's way through rating systems with; the art and audio definitely isn't what's landing this good ratings.\n\nThe audio is an important part to touch on, since it's basically 80% of the scariness factor. Ambient creepy sounds and sketchy, computer-edited voice acting is basically the scariest parts of the game, despite a couple scenes with visual scares, though those are unsettling at most (it's hard to be spooked by a drawing alone with this skill level of art).\n\nAll-in-all Close Your Eyes is a decent game, nothing super special but nothing to overlook. I think it's a good experience despite how absolutely dull the gameplay itself is: needless to say, if there was no horror theme to this game, it'd be about a 2/10. But the game is scary, mostly atmospheric, and mostly established through audio, so headphones are a good idea (which it tells you to do at the beginning of the game). It's free, it's short, and it's also visually unaesthetic, but that's okay, the poor art actually emphasizes the sketchy mood of the game. Now if you were to tell me that's on purpose, I would not believe you. Being able to draw bad on purpose is something only extremely comfortable artists can do, and it's noticeably different from ACTUAL bad drawings, which is what Close Your Eyes is comprised of.\n\nScary, short, bad art, good story, dramatic, sketchy, creepy, free. Try it out.\n\n7.1/10","December 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dwell into the reality and mind of our character's past and present. This horror - genre game is quite heart-pounding indeed. The developers have great sense of imagination and creativity of what horror game looks like. It would be marvelous indeed if the developers establish more solid artwork and time in creating this game. No frequent jumpscares and that is a good thing (players tend to get adaptive if too much jumpscares), good voice acting, marvelous soundtrack, great dialogue plotting, challenging puzzles, dynamic story, and most and importantly, it has a great sense of aesthetics in this game because horror game usually tries to frighthen us players into thinking "something bad is going to happen", and this game really uses elements of horror game quite marvelously from its pitch black surroundings and environment. The developers really quite uses great technique in creating this game, from its research  as well. Manipulating people's subconcious mind, and futhermore psychological behaviour as well.\n\nWithout further ado, this game reserve a 7.5/10 review.\n\nPros :\n+Solid story background and mysteries\n+Great sense of aesthethics\n+Challenging puzzles\n+Good soundtrack\n+Immersive branching story\n\nCons :\n-Poor environment artwork\n-Lack of UI\n-Few help option\n\nI would like to thank AesthethicGamer for creating this game as well, in the near future I will write a review as well in my own blog about this game.

There are POSSIBLE SPOILERS in this review, but I will hide them.\n\nUPDATED 3/28/16 [I finished the game]\n\nPROS\n-Price: This game is FREE\n-Voice Acting: While it's a bit sparse, the voice acting that is present is very well done.\n-Tone/Mood: The atmosphere of the game is extremely dark, and lends itself well to the overall story that is being presented to us. Dialogue also gives off an eerie feeling.\n-Story: I don't think I've ever come across a game like CYE before. It has a unique premise that lends itself to the horror genre.\n-Style: Jesus the art in this game gave me the creeps. And that's a very good thing! The game's art sucks you into the story and the overall atmosphere of the game. My favorite thing about this game so far is the sparse lighting. Having everything very dimly lit sets the tone and sucks you into the story even more.\n-Protagonist: Even though our protagonist (the death row inmate) rarely speaks, I really like him. The game is so well done that you can actually feel yourself sympathizing with a murderer. (Also, he's a cute little bouncy thing. Who could resist?)\n-Antagonist: GOD YES. The Host and Simon are wondefully done characters who served their purposes well. Simon, especially -- any scene involving him gave me chills.\n-Other Characters: The Girl and The Girl in Yellow were wonderful, unforgettable characters who enhanced the story.\n-Ambient Sounds: Beautiful, eerie, and haunting soundtrack that made me shiver at several points when playing.\n\nCONS\n-Soundtrack: I only had 1 problem with the soundtrack but for me, it was relatively major. There are a few scenes that involve a character called The Girl that are supposed to be beautiful and emotional but had the cheesiest music EVER behind them. I would have enjoyed the scene had there not been cheesy music in the background. I love the rest of the music so far, being ambient and without vocals. But the music with vocals -- especially being such a cheesy song -- really took me out of the game.\n\nOverall, I would give Close Your Eyes a 94/100. It is most definitely worth a try!","March 11","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So many keys. The triangle key, the square key, rectangle, circle, star, heart, annulus, blabis, just-- It's a key chain search at this point. The beginning was interesting, but once I got to the manor and it became Key Quest Extraordinaire, I was frustrated and bored (so bored). And then sneaking past the tornado/bedsheet thing (which I believe I know what it is but eh, spoilers) was just ridiculous. It's too fast. I decided that my interest wasn't strong enough to try to get past a walking bedsheet.\n\nIn more balanced review, the start hooked me. The weird visuals, the odd music (or tones, not really music at times) was fascinating. There was quite a lot of "this path is blocked, go get the thing to unblock it" as the game continued until it was just ridiculous. There had to be at least a dozen or more keys.\n\nThe voice acting... well, it could definitely use a re-do. The Announcer was too close to the microphone during the "angry" recordings and all that stood out was the weird sound of lips hitting each other. It was almost overwhelming. There wasn't a consistent tone or attitude-- it really felt like it was a random voice alternately praising you and growling to close your eyes.  I GET IT. EYES SHOULD BE CLOSED. The growling wasn't even consistent, and it sounded way too forced, like the person recording still had a smile on, trying to be supah spoopy, gotta scurr the kiddos, not "oh god please I don't want to die." The woman who sung the songs had either a mediocre voice with poor timing, or a bad song to record and tried her best. I couldn't tell. Either way, it was annoying.","September 29, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Stock sounds + completely borrowed/ripped off tracks minus the sappy as hell ending song. There was about two recordings that added to the atmosphere.\n\nGameplay:\nNothing special here, typical RPG maker top-down, and there's nothing wrong with that. The puzzles here were either so easy you get bored, have absolutely no direction, or are borrowed from other games (7 deadly sins puzzle, I'm looking at you). You have to hug the wall because the lighting is too dark, it doesn't add to the atmosphere it just makes the game irritating to navigate.\n\nEverything else:\nThe writing is the best part of this game, I have to admit I was really creeped out.

Some of the challenges answers didn't make sense even after looking up the answer but that can be forgiveable.\nThe best parts of this game was the voice acting and dialogue. It was different then usual games and I think they did a good job making you uneasy whilst you play.\nSo what's the problem? It doesn't make any sense, when I finished the game I was unsatisfied confused I had no explaination the storyline was chopped and I was hoping that whilst I played the story would unfold and would make sense. However, I couldn't work out why I was there, who the girls in the story were, who the narrator was? It was extremely unsatisfying. My boyfriend watched me play and he was just as stumped and confused why this game had received so many positive reviews.\nThough the atmosphere is dark and unsettling it there was never a time I wanted to stop playing due to fear (though I wanted to stop for other reasons). It didn't quite manage to get that horror feeling that amnesia and other horror games manage.","March 21","false","3.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Some horror RPG's always has this cheap plot to try and  win you over and always copying some sort of  elements from other RPG horrors either something is chasing you or its god-like powers causes them to go insane watching your every move because simply they're hostile,oh the spooks some evil entity wants to kill us all, they all seem too boring to finish its almost like they're trying so hard to be that overly dramatic climax everyone trys to achieve NOOOOOOOOOOOOO and I'm your father... there's expectations and exploits for horror games there are tons of ways this could've have been scary instead it decided to be crap puzzles and cheap sounds that I guess are supposed to scare you OOOOOO someone is chewing or giggling and laughing while taking a ♥♥♥♥ like every ♥♥♥♥ing horror game ever HAHAHAHAHAHAH <----- that laugh text was unexpected too spooky for me.  but on a serious note these games want to simulate a sort of claustrophobia of fear but I just look at my screen and think, "♥♥♥♥ should I even keep going? I think I'm just playing because I'm bored now." and don't give me that, "well its low-res graphics give it a chance" THAT'S BS I'mma stop you right there because the first doom when I played as a kid scared me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ now these ARE PG PC HORROR INDIE games are tacky and over CONFIDENT about its story and gameplay like the twilight series and the endless fandom that goes along with it, now thats scary. Ao Oni was a good free horror RPG until it was ♥♥♥♥♥ repeatedly by youtube let's players so just play the game you'll know what I mean and if it makes you feel the same and think it's as terrible as "Close Your Eyes" then you can have cups of bleach for breakfeast, lunch, dinner, dessert and don't forget a nice midnight snack","May 23","false","0.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE.\n\n\nSummary\nPros:\n+Atmosphere\n+Music\n+Unsettling\nCons:\n-Endless fetch quest section <-- This gets really bad\n-Things felt like they were put into the game just because and lacked real importance to the story\n-Lots of running through pointless corridors\n-Predictable ending\n\nI really enjoyed the atmosphere, the music, and the voice acting for a free-to-play game and I appreciate the effort the creator put into making this. The best way to describe this game would be 'unsettling' as you explore the characters history, there won't be many jumpscares or monster encounters. Play it for the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, I agree with some of the other reviewers who were critical about the party scene. Having to search an incredibly confusing maze house to find a ton of keys got boring, redundant, and very frustrating. There were many times that I thought I was done but then had to go back into the maze and search for more keys. If it ended after you left the party house that would have been sufficient. But having to fetch keys over and over again while the story progressed felt suffocating. It took away from the feelings of uneasiness because they were replaced by frustration and irritation.\n\nSome of the motifs and symbolism in the game were great but not used to their fullest potential.\n\nOverall, I was left disappointed by the ending (heard there's more then one..?) and my overall playthrough. I yearned for more density in the game.","September 7, 2015","false","2.3"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","7","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smkinoshita/recommended/377330/","smkinoshita","Smik","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smkinoshita/","140 products in account","One sentence review:  It's a wanna-be RPG Maker version of Silent Hill 3 that fell quite short for me but others might enjoy it.\n\n"Close Your Eyes" bites a lot of the Silent Hill series and probably should have used a different engine than RPG Maker.  Some of the elements are nearly plagerized such as the 'red light chasing you' as well as the writing from the one puzzle from SIlent Hill 3 that has a morbid consumption clue.\n\nWhile some of the artwork works well -- blinking away so the gimpse is temporary -- the atmosphere falls short.  Making the protagonist some marshmallow guy really detracts from things as does a general lack of detail in the area.  The writing has some good bits but is mostly overshadowed by really bad bits and one puzzle with a solution that even given the horror setting will irritate some people and downright offend others.\n\nBut the biggest flaw of the game is that it drags.  Your protagonist can't move very quickly and most of the game is a matter of finding the key, unlocking the door.   Considering the lack of combat or meaningful interaction, why bother with using RPG Maker at all?  There's lots of other more suitable game making software that would have done the job better (Construct 2 for example)\n\nThe second critical part I find is the writing.  It really does feel like a fan-game version of Silent Hill 3 (with some aspects borrowing from 2) right down to the hidden Alien ending.\n\nAnd here's where I really debated giving it a negative review.  All in all, is it truly a bad game?  I've played much worse and seen worse writing from the Triple A game industry.  There are some good, although rather ham-fisted puzzles.\n\nWell, while it was a distraction and there was some serious effort put into the game, the critical problem is the game doesn't understand why other games put in the elements that they did, so it puts things in because other horror games did.  It doesn't understand horror beyond bog-standard 'disturbing looking monsters and slowed down deep voices'.  Worst of all, it bites too hard on Silent Hill.  Compare this to "Lone Survivor" which did understand the elements applied to Silent Hill 2 and did its own thing with it.\n\nIf the developers see this review and want to hear some suggestions on how to improve it, here's what I can suggest:\n- Decide if you want to sympathize or be horrified by the protagonist.  If the player is to sympathize, make the crimes committed more abstract and beyond a simple one-word-response.  If the player is to be horrified, then the crime needs to be more explicit, interactive and have an impact on the story.\n- Use symbolism.  It should begin in an extremely subtle way and then become more and more obvious as the game progresses.  Silent Hill was HUGE on symbolism, even in the symbollically-very-watered-down Silent Hill 3.\n- Don't use a marshmallow guy.  He just doesn't work; not cute enough to be ironic, too cute to be a believable threat, and doesn't really fit with the background.\n- Don't use so much black, or if you do stick to the light-source method.  It just looks lazy otherwise.\n- Allow the player to run.  If stealth is to be an option then give a player a reason to take things slow.\n- Clearly mark doors.\n- Detail levels vary greatly.  The graveyard cares about positioning but most of the rest of the game doesn't.  Be consistent.\n- Watch Jacob's Ladder, it was the key source material for Silent Hill.\n","September 5, 2015","false","1.9"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Dr. Michael Strother (Goran Visnjic) is a psychologist and hypnotherapist who has relocated from the United States to England after an ugly incident in which a boy under Strother's care died while swimming, possibly due to a mistakenly triggered hypnotic suggestion. Strother sometimes sees visions which he believes are images from the minds of his patients, and while hypnotizing Janet Losey (Shirley Henderson), a police detective who is trying to give up cigarettes, he sees a terrifying vision of a girl trapped beneath the surface of a stream. Strother learns that the girl in his vision is Heather, a teenager who has recently disappeared; when found, she's disoriented, unable to speak, and has strange new tattoos on her arms. Despite the pleas of his wife Clara (Miranda Otto) to keep his distance, Strother becomes involved in the case, and with the help of Elliot (Paddy Considine), a dealer in fantasy games, he learns that the bizarre gibberish Heather has been spouting are part of the rituals of an outmoded religious rite. As Strother and Losey dig deeper into the bizarre crime, they're led into a twisted web of intrigue, violence, and religious fanaticism.","September 25, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"
