At its core it's a mild puzzle-platformer, in which you can directly control the titular doggy through varying platforming challenges. Along the way, you get to control elements in the environments via the cursor, which involves some mild puzzle solving.\n\nBoth platforming and puzzles are very easy and for those who require it, there are lightbulbs to collect which can be exchanged for tips at the varying puzzles you’ll encounter. The game is less about actual challenge and more about drawing you in with its aesthetics and this it does well. Every level represents a dream and the vector based, layered graphics really supplement this well.\n\nThe biggest problem the game has, is that it’s really short. At this moment it features 5 levels, with the promise of more (free) levels in future updates. These initial five levels can be played through within an hour. This one hour offers an amazing experience however and the longing for more in a way, is a huge compliment to the actual quality of the game and in particular how well it manages to draw the player into its different settings.\n\nAt the full price point, it’s a bit of a hard recommendation to make for the amount of content you’re actually getting at the moment. However, if you do end up picking it up, you’ll find a fun little game to go through while it lasts and hopefully we’ll see more levels down the road to showcase more of the creativity from this team. I’d especially recommend this game to those with younger children, people fairly new to video games or just those who enjoy experiencing different artistic expressions, who are less concerned with finding actual challenge in games. For those people, this is a must, at least during sales.\n\nSee my video review for a full impression.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIVcT2S05W8","March 22","true","4.8"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","16","19","2","0"

The underlying story for each level is Mimpi showing up and saving the day. The game is very casual. You bark at, and interact with objects in the background to help you progress through the levels.\n\nPros:the controls are customizable, and the game has full controller support\ncute graphics - the 2D animation is simple, yet colourfully done\ncasual/kid friendly game, with simple gameplay and hints\nCons:some of the whistling sounds are a bit annoying (a volume control setting for music and sound effects independently would have been helpful instead of just an on/off toggle)\nvery short game\nThere are hidden secrets that you can discover, as well as other, more easily found collectibles to earn achievements. Once you find everything, there is little to no replayability.\n\nThe entire game took me a bit over an hour to complete all 6 levels. The price on Steam is too high to pay for the game’s current content, so I would definitely wait for a sale. Currently, the game is also available for Android and iOS. If you’re looking for something short, casual, or kid-friendly, Mimpi Dreams is a cute game, and it was fun to play while it lasted.","March 22","true","1.7"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

You are immediately launched into the game with not a lot of background on what's going on, they explain the events through pictures in speech bubbles but I was ultimately confused to what was going on. I liked the game mechanics and all of the funky and cute little creatures scattered throughout. The game does get harder as it progresses but beware, the game is extremely short. I put 0.3 hours into it and I'm already 32% in, even after I missed a collectible. You can watch the video above if you wish to see game play on it. So the cons are the price tag, the length and the unexplained story, but I bet you any child and some teens would love the game.","March 22","true","0.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

This is a small issue that doesn't really take away from the game.","April 2","true","5.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
