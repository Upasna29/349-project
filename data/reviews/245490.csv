Not the best one, but good. But it's not even good. Because Ubisoft.\nUplay? Check.\nMicrotransactions? Check.\nSeason pass that don't include all DLCs? Check.\nMultiplayer that was added after all DLCs? Check. Most players just moved on already.\nAlso the game has much worse optimisation than Trials Evolution, a lot less stable and so on. Just be aware that you might not be able to launch it at all because reasons.\n\nThe main problem is that Trials Fusion isn't exactly the most creative game... It's just another sequel just like Ubisoft likes it - bland unispiring game with exactly the same visuals and gameplay with a bunch of gimmicks and extensive marketing campaign on top.\n\nTrials Evolution was just better game overall. It was just that - complete package without gimmicks, a really great and all round polished game in which developers cleary put their love and soul. And Trials Fusion is just a second-rate game that only exists to get your money, Ubi-business as always.","October 2, 2015","false","10.5"," 203 of 256 people (79%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","79","203","256","12","6"

However, as a person who has dedicated over 120 hours into Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I must say that Fusion is pretty underwhelming compared to it.\n\nFirst of all, there are significantly fewer levels in this game than there are in TEGE - it took me at least 20 hours to get the medal tally required to unlock the platinum medals, but in Fusion it only took me 4 hours. It definitely felt like a step backwards in content.\n\nThis leads to the next point - Ubisoft decided that in order for us to get more levels, we'd have to fork out money for a season pass. That's right, they took our beloved Trials franchise and decided to include DLC in it. It definitely feels like a dog move against us.\n\nLastly, they decided to leave out the most essential feature when they released this game - online multiplayer! And only this year they decide they're finally going to release it? Pretty crap if you ask me.\n\nFinal verdict - If you have played Trials Evolution Gold Edition for a while and feel like playing some new, different levels, buy this game when it's on sale, as if you ignore all of its flaws it's a pretty good game.\nIf you have never played a trials game before, buy Trials Evolution Gold Edition as it is a lot more fun to play than this game.","January 4, 2015","false","8.4"," 195 of 266 people (73%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","73","195","266","5","2"

This is a time waster, if you make it through to the extreme maps, then I'd say good luck.\n\nThe difficulty of the game ranges from beginner, easy, normal, hard, extreme. When you are on the beginner maps you'll blast through the  levels, although when you move up, it'll of  course get harder - a lot harder.\n\nThe game has 1  big bug which could put you off buying it though. It's that low fps cause a slowmotion effect, which renders the game more or less unplayable. A solution is to lower the settings, but i'd just like to include this.\n\nThe DLC that's out so far (3 out of 6 planned)  they're all worth picking up IF you like the game. I'd say they're more difficult than the other maps, but not by much. In each DLC  you get atleast 9 new trails. I think you'd have to be a person that wants to get the best medal on everything to justify the 5€ price tag though.\n\nI personally love this game when I need to take a break from everything.

First up is Uplay. Everyone hates Uplay.\n\nThere are never any players online, so there goes that whole section of gameplay... there's never anybody to play with.\n\nThe DLC is just a huge money grab. The game by itself doesn't have enough content to justify the $19.99 price tag. I paid it and expected a lot... I got a little with the offer to pay more to get tracks that should have come with the game. That extra $19.99 for the season pass seems steep, because it is. $40 for a "complete" game that doesn't have much depth or the replayability of the older Trials games is a rip off. If the DLC (which should have come with the game anyways) was included in the original price, I would be more apt to recommend it.\n\nScrew Ubisoft for being so greedy, and for forcing Uplay on the innocent.","July 15, 2015","false","10.5"," 143 of 206 people (69%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","69","143","206","5","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rawr365/recommended/245490/","Rawr365","Dj =D","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rawr365/","463 products in account","Sale edit: Every DLC is on sale right now, this hasn't happened before, so take the very low price into account with my DLC reviews :)\n\nAwesome level MAX Edit: This isn't included in the season pass, and as yet I do not own it. I'll update this section with details on whether the DLC is worth a full price or not when I purchase it for myself. As for the introduced microtransactions, they're purely cosmetic and not required.\n\nIntroduction\nThis was the first Trials game I ever played, and it's great. Don't let the negative reviews put you off, most of them are negative simply because it uses Uplay, which I shall talk about further down the review.\n\nSetting\nFirst off, the environment in this game is stunning. For a game like Trials, in which you just ride your bike across level after level, you wouldn't expect this level of quality, the world looks like it's part of a much larger game. There's also plenty of variety, as you quickly move from the futuristic city to platforms in the sky, ancient ruins, outdoor courses, underwater bases and even the planet's core. There is also some slight hints of story included through a few characters talking throughout the game, which hint at how the world became like this.\n\nGameplay\nIt's trials. You drive your bike, tilt your weight and try to make it to the end as fast as possible and with as few failures as possible. Every level also has three challenges that encourage you to play differently, and some even involve minigames entirely different to how the game is usually played. The difficulty as you pass through the levels is done very well. By the time I was met with much harder obstacles, I'd already got a basic idea of how to surpass them, and not once did a death feel cheap.\n\nDLC\nThe DLCs add some nice extra content that also gives you a look at more of the world of Fusion, and provide some decent challenge. I wouldn't recommend buying them seperately, but if you don't want to buy the Deluxe Edition, here's a summary of their content and quality:\n2/10/15 Edit: Read the Deluxe Edition section for my opinion on prices!\n\nRiders of the Rustlands\nThe first DLC and the weakest. Featuring only 6 levels, an FMX course and a mediocre minigame. - Not really worth £4 compared to the other DLCs, skip this one and get another.\n\nEmpire of the Sky\nSame as above, 6 levels, FMX and a minigame. The levels are a bit better than Rustlands, but still not worth £4. If you've beat the game and want some more fun, get this DLC. Otherwise you can ignore it.\n\nWelcome to the Abyss\nBreaks the chain and includes 8 levels instead of 6, as well as the FMX and minigame at the end. This DLC gives an interesting look at an underwater empire that used to live under the ocean. Some story is delivered through another AI who speaks to you at certain points. The levels are of a higher standard than the first two DLCs, and I think barely justifies its £4 pricetag.\n\nFire in the deep\n9 levels, FMX and a minigame. In this DLC you are even further down, underneath the planet's core. As you move from level to level you go further underground, giving a nice indication of your progress through the DLC. There are also multiple secret recordings hidden around the levels, which give some extra information about the world, and what went on in the mines. Worth it.\n\nFault One Zero\nPersonally, I believe this is the best DLC. It drops one level and returns to 8 trials again, but the quality of the levels steps up greatly. This DLC has a focus on technology, much more so than previously shown, with teleporters, anti gravity machines and Mechs featuring. The levels in this DLC are very inventive, including  one that repeatedly glitches between looking normal, and a blue cyberspace-esque environment and  an interesting level in which you drive around inside three arcade machines! This DLC is definitely worth £4.\n\nAfter the Incident\nThe sixth and final DLC. Same as above, 8 levels with an FMX and Minigame. One of my main disapointments with Trials Fusion was the lack of detail as to what was happening. I understand that this is a game solely based on a random guy riding a bike through obstacle courses, but with such an interesting world, with many deeper story elements hinted at throughout, I really wanted to learn more. After the Incident does so nicely. It's set in the future, when all the world is in ruins after the aforementioned "Incident". The levels all focus on fairly different areas, all destroyed or going through some form of crisis. Similar to Fire in the Deep, you can find secrets in the levels, which give you some backstory as to how all of this started. The way this is done is great, as  SynDI talks to you through a dating game text box, with amusing exagerated changes in her expression as she talks. If you want to know more about the world behind Fusion, or just want to play even more levels, this DLC is worth the money.\n\nDeluxe Edition\nI'd like to point out that this game has gone on multiple sales, but not a single time have the DLC packs gone on discount themselves, and it doesn't look like they will at any time unfortunately. --In the most recent sale at the time of writing, all DLCs aside from Awesome Level MAX have been reduced to 99p, so I'd definitely recommend waiting for a sale before purchasing any DLCs-- As such, I highly recommend you get the Deluxe edition during a sale, I managed to pick it up for £10. Otherwise, if you beat the game and decide you want more, you will be paying a much higher price. Say you got the base game on sale for £6. Now if you got three of the DLCs, that'll cost you an extra £12. Half the DLC total DLC and you've spent £18 already. The Deluxe edition is a much better purchase (During a sale of course. The DLC is good but not worth £30!)\n\nWhy the negative reviews?\nNow, there are three main flaws that have gave this game so many negative reviews. First main point is the multiplayer. I played the game entirely solo and had fun, I can't really comment on it.\nSecondly, people seem to be complaining about this being a bad port, and having a many performance issues. For reference, I ran the game on an i5 3570k, 8gb RAM and a GTX 770 with constant 60fps and no issues of any kind. The issue may be related to lower-end machines.\nAnd as for the last point, UPlay. The majority of these reviews are from people starting the game, seeing Uplay, closing it and leaving a bad review. I will say right here that if you avoid this game because of Uplay, you are stupid.\n\nBut UPlay sucks!\nThe impact of UPlay is nowhere near as bad as the reviews make it sound. You start the game on Steam, UPlay appears, takes a couple seconds to log in, then minimizes and starts the game. You only need to interact with it once in order to create an account, and after that you don't need to touch the thing, aside from closing it when you are done.\n\nEDIT: UPlay now does not even appear when you start a game through Steam. It minimizes itself. Seriously guys, the impact is so minimal it's not even worth arguing about!\n\nConclusion\nAll in all, I recommend Trials Fusion to anyone who is an existing trials fan, or enjoys 2D games with high difficulty. Though the price is a little steep for the content on offer, so I'd suggest waiting for a sale and getting the deluxe edition. As earlier stated, it's much better value as the DLCs never get discounted, and only costed £4 (the price of a single DLC) more than the normal pack in the latest sale. And finally, do not avoid this game because of UPlay, there is no reason to.","May 18, 2015","true","17.1"," 75 of 102 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","75","102","5","14"

I'm not at all alright while playing it, but I still love it. After the rage wears off, the game gives you a good sense of accomplishment when you finally get that 0 fault gold medal run, especially on later (hard) stages.\n\nWhile Trials Fusion is a streamlined trials game (it is much, much easier than Evolution), there is still a good amount of hard tracks in the base game, and a few of them only the most persistent players will be able to "gold medal" (while others will rage quit out of the game and write a review...). There are 8 zones in the base game, and each one has 6 to 10 tracks in it (8 on average), that number is significantly increased with the season pass, which adds 6 new zones. Right now, 9/10/2014, the season pass only offers 3 zones, with 3 more on the way before May 2015. The game also includes a track editor, so you can create your own tracks, and you can easily access and play tracks built by other people online (which are pretty impressive from what I've seen/played).\n\nNow I'm not a big fan of Ubisoft's PC releases, because I usually get hit by poor optimization issues that plague a lot of their games at release, this game's performance however, pleasantly surprised me and put a big fat smile on my face, after the stutter fest that was Trials Evolution Gold Edition, I wasn't very hopeful going into this one. The game runs perfectly smooth maxed out on my machine, and the only stutter I got was on a graphically intensive track, while I had 2 video streams running in the background, after trying the same track without flash videos hogging my cpu, the stutter went away, and the game ran buttery smooth again.\n\nFor reference, my PC specs are:\n\ni7 920 @3Ghz\ngtx660ti 2gb\n8gb ram\nwin7 64bit\n\nIt's worth mentioning that the game has a pretty good, yet weird sense of humor, for example whenever you finish a track, something funny and dumb is sure to happen, like the rider falling of his bike after he crosses the finish line, landing in the water and racing a cruise ship, or when you cross a finish line that's on top of a 2 story hut, the door closes behind you, and the hut starts flying off like a rocket. I also really enjoy the AI commentary (I guess you can call them the narrators), and the biker's yells and woohoos remind me of Homer Simpson.\n\nThis game is a steal even at full price, and on a decent sale it should be a no-brainer if you played and liked previous Trials games, but I'm sure 2D platformer game enthusiasts would love it as well. As for the score, I'm giving it a 9/10.","October 9, 2014","true","10.6"," 58 of 75 people (77%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","77","58","75","8","2"

Get some friends together and it only multiplies it, but it's solid even by itself.\n\nHere's a video showcasing my shenanigans in this game for those who are curious. If not, just read the rest of the review below.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/3CtaMJHEkaY\n\nI'll start by saying the gameplay is pretty simple, but challenging at the same time. The only thing you're doing is balancing your rider and your bike along a path while pounding the gas. However, the balancing part is the main problem and where all the challenge lies. The courses have you flying and leaping over all sorts of nonsensical obstacles, and landing it perfectly just doesn't happen sometimes. Even more so when you're trying to show off in front of your friends and botch the trick. But in my personal opinion, it's more fun failing than it actually is succeeding. It's hilarious watching my rider flop around because I was being a dope and got overzealous in my flips, which is a huge boon to the game because you're having a blast whether you're succeeding or failing miserably like I do sometimes.\n\nThe game also doesn't feel cheap, nor feel like it cheats you out of anything. It's easy enough to get a silver medal on most tracks, but getting a gold is never too out of reach. It saddens me a little that doing tricks doesn't net you anything special besides cool points for yourself, but at the same time, it's one less thing I have to worry about if all I'm trying to do is unlock things. It allows you to play the game the way you want to, and having more options of playing the game is always better.\n\nAnd even when you run out of tracks to do in the game, there is a track creation tool that can make more and be shared with the comminity, so you don't have to worry about stuff to do. The game is even getting DLC in the future with more tracks if community stuff isn't your thing, so there's an option for you there as well.\n\nAs far as negatives go, my complaints are very minor. While the stages themselves look amazing, all the stuff that's happening sometimes can be a little distracting from what you're doing. Or sometimes even the reverse is true, that you're so focused on your bike, you don't notice all the stuff happening around you when you want to see it. Another thing is that all of the stuff happeing in the background doesn't really effect what you're doing in the foreground. It's just fluff. I think it would've added a bit more diversity and dynamics if the stage interacted with the rider more.\n\nThere's also still a few bugs in the game or poor optimization. When I went to the create tool, it locked up my comp, which is a beast and shouldn't have any trouble loading anything. The same goes with how long it takes to select a ride at the beginning of the stages. I just stare at a black screen for a good while before something eventually pops up. But thankfully you can just press A to go to the course regardless, so it isn't that big of a deal.\n\nSo to sum it up, for 20 dollars, you're gonna have a blast with this title. It looks good, feels good, has a great sense of humor (the endings and the announcer make me laugh quite a bit), has potential to grow, and is fun with friends. Definitely pick this up, even more so when it goes on sale.","April 24, 2014","true","9.2"," 121 of 184 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","121","184","0","3"

I still believe Trials HD is the best in the series, but that's more a personal opinion. I would recommend checking out the previous game, Trials Evolution Gold Edition, rather than settling on Fusion. Although the multiplayer is still rather empty, it's still a more down-to-earth title that keeps a lot of the aesthetics that make the Trials series so great.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/recommended/245490/","bahderb","Bah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bahderb/","2487 products in account","Trials Fusion is the latest installment in what has generally been a game that offers a simple premise but provides a lot of gameplay punch.  While there aspects of Fusion that I am greatly impressed with, there are a few things that I am unhappy with.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, the Trials games are a very simple premise. You're riding a motorbike (along with other vehicles in Fusion) across a large variety of tracks with physics being the ultimate gameplay component. You have to control the bike properly or you will wipe out.....A LOT!\n\nI've broken this into a simple pros/cons list for anyone that has tl;dr issues :-)\n\nPros:\n+ Looks fantastic. The colors are rich and have real pop to them. If you can play this in Ultra at the highest resolution you're in for a treat, even at lower resolutions it still is great eye candy\n+ Base game course design is interesting for the most part and the futuristic setting adds more than I thought it would.\n+ Trick/FX gameplay styles really add to the depth and encourage playing tracks multiple times with both fastest times and trick scores being seperate goals.\n+ A ton of community made tracks at your fingertips.\n\nCons:\n- Pricey DLC with the season pass costing the same price as the base game making MSRP for both base and season pass (a.k.a. Deluxe Edition) just $20 less than a AAA title. There have been two DLC packs released thus far with more to come.\n- Some base game courses are much shorter than you'd expect.\n- Lacks the challenge at the lower levels that earlier Trials titles brought. Seems watered down for casuals/newcomers in respects. The physics are still brutal depending on course, but definitely easier to get the hang of. ATVs are disgustingly easy.\n-  Four months after release and online multiplayer is still not in the game, yet is promised by the developer. This is UNACCEPTABLE when being advertised as having multiplayer especially at the cost of the full package. Local multiplayer only at the moment (8/23/14 is the date of this review).\n- Tedious unlocking system.\n- There seems to be some measure of a "story" mode to the single player game where you're regularly spoken to by a female AI similar to GlaDOS of the Portal games, except the Trials AI lady lacks the wit of that classic character and is generally just grating.\n\nLet me be clear, while my cons are glaring, I do not regret my purchase of this game. I have a real soft spot for this series and have gotten a lot of mileage out of the earlier titles and am going to continue to play this one as it plays well and I can't overstate how great it looks. I was first introduced to Trials when it came out on Xbox 360 Arcade and I put well over 100 hours into that iteration of the game. I hesitated on this new one until I upgraded my hardware and now that I have, I am very glad I waited at least until then.  That being said, unless you are like me and a fan of the Trials series and know what you're getting into, do yourself a favor and hold off until this is on sale.\n\nI recommend this with a caveat. Definitely pick it up when on sale, but unless you're really into the series/gameplay style, you're fine waiting.\n","August 23, 2014","true","7.0"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","24","36","2","0"

It has bikes, a screaming guy, the most hilarious tricksystem I've ever seen, and FUUUTUREEEEE!!!\n\nFor the people that owned Trials Evolution:\nIf you had a fun time with Trials Evolution I'm 100% sure you'll love Fusion, the game has been revamped, a whole set of new bikes, new courses, a new world, new music, and CHALLENGES !\nIn summary, if you love Evolution, Fusion is no difference, its familiar, funky music, new bikes, tracks and what not.\n\nFor the people that are new to the Trials series:\nLet me tell you that this game is not for the fainted hearts, this game is easy but it gets tougher and tougher, until you say F*ck this I quit. Ofcourse, the more you'll play the more you'll get familiar with the physics on the bike, the tracks and other useful tips and tricks you'll pick up on while playing.\n\n- I highly recommend playing this with a controller, either Xbox or PS3 (Get an emulator that emulates your ps3 controller to x360) Because while progressing through the game, there are a lot of climbs, bunnyhops and other hard tricks you'll have to pull of precise in order to place some good times on the scoreboard and finishing faultless, therefore I'd highly recommend a controller more than a clunky keyboard.\n\n- The game looks really colorful, it's like a rainbow took a ♥♥♥♥ on the game, thats how colorful it is, and it's pretty, really pretty.\nIts an absolute joy and feast for your eyes.\nNever the less screw the graphics cuz gameplay > graphics amirite? If you said no then smh.\n\n- The game starts easily like I said but when progressing it gets more difficult on a level of "Not finishable" If you're brand new and having issues with this platformer.\nThe physics play a huge roll in this game which is why it takes skill to successfully and flawlessly play and finish this game.\n\n- Challenges that have been added in the game, which are mini tasks you CAN do (Not need to) for extra XP are also lots of fun and sometimes really stressful. They make you feel super happy once you've completed it. They make you feel annoyed and boiling when you screw it up in the end.\nNote: I suck at reviews, never done one but I'm just typing whatever comes to mind and what I would like to know about a game I'm willing to buy.\n\n- Customisation has been redone, you can now pick from multiple sets of "armor/suits" that are unlockable by finishing tracks, earning xp or doing certain tasks. The only negative thing that I can think of is that you can not save the color you have picked for example on your shirt, to match that with your pants/helmet... Customisation is a cool addon, also the bikes are again modifyable (if that's a word >.<) in which you unlock bodykits and wheels to customize them. That's pretty cool if you ask me.\n\n- Two slightly annoying things that I've noticed while playing this (Also been confirmed by other friends that play trials) The loading time on the Garage/customisation takes a while (10-20s) so that could be a little issue if you're inpatient.\n\n- If you do happen to buy the game, let me tell you "WELCOME TO THE FUTURE" on every single start up. It makes me laugh but can get annoying if you pick up on it.\n\nIn summary: The game handles great, controller recommended, great visuals, easy to pick up and play, hard to master, great value with a lot of grinding on challenges that are added to each and EVERY track (Yes even extreme tracks). If you're still not sure I recommend reading some other reviews that are more helpful than mine is\nI tried my best >:3\n\nThank you","April 25, 2014","true","7.6"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","5"

The stages built around doing those tricks for points are too unforgiving: the checkpointing means you only get one shot at each jump trick, so any failed attempt means you've lost a potential 20% or so points for that stage. Maybe losing your multiplier would have been enough of a deterrent; as it stands, falling is too easy and too costly, so it makes sense to play it safe -- and that's boring, especially for a mode that's supposed to be a bit more crazy than the precision driving at the core of the franchise. Uniracers did it first and better, basically.\n\n'Challenges' are either Easter eggs hard to figure out without a guide, or require feats like finishing with zero fault while doing 10 tricks or never letting go of the gas pedal. That's one way to stretch playtime over a small number of tracks...\n\nTournaments are one thing that's improved, though: they're time-limited and renewed every few hours, which is a good encouragement to participate and try to rank high.\n\nNow that the first piece of DLC (out of a planned 6) is out, it's obvious that we can't count on them to fix the fundamental problem of there not being enough content: each will be the size of a world, so 6 regular tracks and 2 gimmicky ones (and the first pack is boring like the rest, too).\n\nAre RedLynx / Ubi counting on player-created content to pick up the slack? Trying to find really good content is still a crapshoot though -- you can only rely on the 'featured' categories, very basic filters, or a percentage of positive reviews. There's quite a few enjoyable enough tracks, some with clever moments, but few if any are comparable in quality to the dev-made tracks from Trials Evolution, and you have to be in the mood to rummage around for them.\n\nIt pains me to say it, but this is a disappointment. Just get Trials Evolution, and don't get Fusion until you've played so much Evo you're sick of it. And even then, be aware it's not great value at full price.","August 1, 2014","false","10.9"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","19","31","0","0"

Thanks to the great bike physics this series is known for, the game is the very definition of “easy to learn, hard to master” and “trial and error”. So it requires a certain degree skill to fully enjoy but in my opinion it is extremely satisfying to see yourself getting better and beating that one hard track you've been stuck for so long.\n\nThe game is not without it's problems: Uplay is mandatory and still a piece of sh*t that nobody wants, micro-transactions (luckily only for cosmetics), DLCs are pretty expensive for the amount of content they offer (best get them on sale), multiplayer is dead due to being added really late paired with PC having lowest audience for Trials games and also a controller is required because keyboard controls are next to useless.\n\nMany Trials veterans say that Evolution is better and more worth playing over Fusion for various reasons and they're probably right but I wouldn't know since I never got into Evolution when it came out on PC. The futuristic setting, electronic music and the ambiguous hidden story of Fusion was more interesting to me than bland old warehouses in a desert valley accompanied by rock music...\n\nBut I'm in the minority who cares about that stuff so this review is simply from a Trials noob who enjoy the game for what it is despite it's faults :)","January 10","true","83.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

As the matter of fact - I love it. At least the first 30 minutes of each gameplay session, until frustration takes the best of me. Unlike other titles, where frustration comes from bad gameplay mechanics, clunky controls or just plain bugs - this game has none of those. Frustration comes only from your own mistakes and lack of focus and patience. I had no problem with the BEGINNER and EASY difficulty mode tracks, whereas in MEDIUM, I first took the time to learn the track and adapt to the ever-changing layout. HARD is where things got really painful. Let's just say that I had to repeat one track a hundred times to get the gold medal. Frustration was followed by a great sense of achievement. I find the new FMX trick system fun, but very difficult or just needed to get used to. One more problem, mentioned by most Steam users: Uplay. Being forced to use two types of DRM is ridiculous and Uplay sucks in general. Sometimes it takes ages to load certain data (bikes, rider accessories and the list of tracks) from the cloud. I bought this game mainly for the purpose of local co-op so I was devastated to find out that you weren't able to play the user-created tracks with your friends. After the latest patch they finally implemented that feature so hopefully we'll have more than the default 10 tracks to enjoy. To sum things up, I enjoy most of the features of Trials: Fusion. Just two things need to go: my lack of skill and Uplay. 9/10","August 11, 2014","true","12.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Great 2.5D graphics, pick up and play for 5 minutes style, high skill ceiling, support for player created content built in at launch, lots of ways to customize your rider and bike. Very competitive leaderboard game.\n\nMeh! Expierienced Trials veteran will find the game very easy to beat up til the Hard/Extreme tracks, skill games are now have to be unlocked and not accessible from own section, less skill games then previous games(probaly will be added via DLC). No launch SLI/Xfire support that causes performance issues.\n\nBleh! Uses UPLAY,some game sections take forever to load, can be very frustrating to some people that could cause rage quits. Seems to be less tracks then previous games but I could be wrong\n\nLowdown: If you have a few friends to play with you will have a blast competing against each other's times, which is where all the appeal is. The game also can be quite rewarding as nothing is as awesome as beating a section of the track that you had been stuck on for 100 faults.\n\n\n4/5","May 6, 2014","true","9.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

That alone is enough for me to recommend it.\n\nAside from the future motif, what's new from previous games is a trick system with some freestyle events to go along with it. I found the system to be really finicky, and most of the time I just skipped the FMX events in favor of the standard trials events. Also, they added a quadbike along with its own separate tier of events, which I enjoyed riding. It's 4WD and heavier than the RWD bikes we're used to.\n\nAlso, apart from the usual replayability from the medals and leaderboards, there are also different challenges for each trials track. Some of them are skill-based (e.g. flipping, riding without leaning, etc.), some involve manipulating the environment, and some are just funny or gimmicky. However, many of them are quite difficult to figure out, and the squirrels from Evolution return as well. Also making a return is the track editor, which allows you to create, share, and ride user-made tracks.\n\nAnd then if you feel like enough of a badass, there are the ninja stages, which just make me want to cry...","July 8, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The game can get pretty difficult and the map makers can turn the game into something entirely different. The games require uPlay as a second DRM, but if you just want one DRM, you can buy it from uPlay directly (and might save money doing so, as Ubisoft wants their uPlay service to grow bigger.) You'd like this game if you are into racing and competiting, though you might still love it if you hate typical racing games.\n\nFor a comparison to Trials Evolution, the last Trials game:\n\nPros:\n- Track editor is miles ahead of the older editor, meaning cooler content if you don't like to edit your own tracks.\n- You can do cool stuns in midair, used in a nice points-based "race."\n- Can customize your biker and your vehicle, including the new ATV.\n- Challenges to complete on every map with very unique challenges on certain maps.\n- Hidden secrets on some maps.\n- SQUIRRELS!\n\nCons:\n- What is optimization? Where did you take my frames? Why did you steal them?\n- The opening theme will get annoyingly stuck in your head if you don't move past it fast...\nWE'LL GO TO THE FUTURE! MAN! MACHINE! THE FUSION! ...WELCOME TO THE FUTURE! *Repeat 100 times*\n- Currently only local multiplayer, but there are ghosts of friends to race against (Online MP will be patched in later.)\n- Unyielding (beat track without tilting; use only gas and brake and never crashing) and Full Throttle (Never let go of gas and never fault) challenges can go ♥♥♥♥ themselves...\nMight be a pro if you're a masochist.","April 25, 2014","true","6.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I owned this originally on the Xbox One and it plays just as well here.\nThis time around, Trials introduces stunts and it's a lot of fun. Trials is a fun motorsport game where you use speed and balance to get to the finish line, try and get the highest stunt score if you're playing the BMX, or whatever whacky challenges they add, such as catapulting your self the furthest after bailing out of your motorcycle.\n\nThe down side to trials is how fast it's been releasing it's titles. I hope they don't release another this or the next year. With stunts, they have nothing else they could add to make this game unique. Community creations are to die for in this game, and it feels like a waste of time if they just release the next game as fast as possible.\n\nThe DLC for this game didn't even add anything except for maps made by content already in the game, unlike other trials where the DLC actually added something new to the game that we could use to create our own tracks.\n\nOverall, I give Trials Fusion an 7/10. Solid game play, community content, and I'm constantly picking this game up to play that I had to buy it for Steam too. If they release another one in 2015, I'll be really dissapointed. I also had to deduct another point because of Uplay. It ruins my gaming experience.","March 13, 2015","true","3.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

My first was Trials 2: Second Edition back in like 2008. I got the demo, played the crap out of it, and bought the game. Many hours went into it, and I was really excited when I saw Trials Evolution: Gold Edition was coming out, and bought it as soon as it did. This game was AMAZING. The soundtrack was fantastic, the graphics were great, the rider customization was fun, the tracks were awesome, it was, overall, far and above Trials 2: Second Edition's minimalistic style. Then I saw Urban Trial Freestyle, and bought that. Great game, though short, and nowhere near as awesome as Trials Evolution. Once I had all of them cleared, I saw on Facebook that Trials Fusion was in the works, and excitedly waited for it's release. After pre-ordering this game, and launching it the first time, I was immediately disappointed. The soundtrack is terrible (maybe not a big deal for you), loading took forever, and the bikes/rider/maps/tracks/menus all look really thrown together without much thought. My opinion, of course, but if you're going to get a Trials game, get Trials Evolution: Gold Edition. That game is the SH**.","August 27, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","44","4","9","3","0"

And if you try to lower the resolution to get a higher framerate, you are forced to stay in windowed mode(btw, "Windowed Mode: Off", "Alt+Enter"? Didn't do s**t). I contacted the devs just for this matter, and all I got is "The bug fix will be implemented in the following updates."\n\nI mean, wow.\n\nThey have time to make a so-called "Awesome MAX" DLC(btw sold separately), yet no time to fix a simple graphic setting bug. Probably the only one fix that came with the latest DLC is one called "Lag MAX now do u like it never mind we devs don't give two s**t" patch.\n\nAnyone reading this review, go buy The Talos Principle, don't play the game, just go to the graphic option, see how graphic setting pages are done, professionally, legittaly, awesomely.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\nLove the game, if I just imagine that I'm watching powerpoint slides instead of actually playing the game.\n\nbtw my gpu is 950m.","September 4, 2015","false","8.4"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","2"

Let's first start with optimization.    This game must have a perfect 60fps to run, because if it drops at all, even to 50fps it slows down so much that it is completely unplayable.  I have to set this game to absolute minimun settings and even then I still get massive fps drops.  And my computer can max out Battlefield 3.  Next we have the addition of the trick system.  It is the most god awful thing you can ever attempt to use.  It does not do what you tell it to do and the rider will frequently get stuck in a position.  But apart from the huge gameplay issues, the game is still just not fun or challenging.  This game is so easy that I was able to beat almost every track first try with a gold medal.  The leaning is also very unresponsive in comparison to older games.  The older games were very fun, but they totally blew it with this one.  Complete waste of $20.

The game is published by Ubisoft, i do not know why you would think they wouldnt put it on their own PC distribution service and account control service.\nYes Uplay is sometimes broken, but those times are not THAT often, it happens  here and there, and Ubisoft doesnt seem to give a ♥♥♥♥. But really, i dont want to review the Publisher or the Developers, which both chose to run this game on the platform.\nThe Game Itself:\n- a very skillbased "racing" game, where the point is more or less to drive through a track with no mistakes, only after that the time really matters\n- has alot of content (though the price with the DLC is pretty high, compared to a triple a title it matches though)\n-> User created content pushes the game forward to a pretty high replay value (which mostly explains my playtime)\nMost negative aspects about it:\n- lack of content of the original game (no dlcs) compared to evolution\n- no ways of communication directly through the game\n- the multiplayer is pretty lagged out (though it is much better than evolution)\n\nOverall, they needed too long for the game to be at this state (which is a pretty definitve version on how a trials game needs to feel like), it felt like a beta for about a year into it. The developers did not abandon the game though and continued to give (free) content for the players to enjoy. With this in mind, i can only say it is one of my most beloved games today, for its high skillcap and active community, which still produces some great quality tracks.\n\n","July 2, 2015","true","264.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have to say, the whole DLC business has left me feeling sour, and I don't think I'll be buying future versions of this game.  I bought a season pass because I don't want to keep making microtransactions or buying additional content.  A bunch of mediocre extra tracks were released as DLC, and then suddenly I have to buy additional content?  Much like many other games nowadays it seems like the developers have gone from focusing on delivering a great game and instead focus on how much money they can bleed out of customers.  Also, with the latest updates, the game seems to run very badly now.  It used to run very well on my high specced gaming laptop, but now it fluctuates all over the place with the framerate speeding up and slowing down the game randomly as it pleases.  Get the previous trials games, but I cannot recommend this game, and I'll be avoiding any further releases due to the capitalist greed that's infected so many other games/developers/publishers.  Also, uPlay is the biggest pile of *%$^# ever.","July 19, 2015","false","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There is no such thing as a bad Trials game! It works fine online AND offline, the classic core gameplay is unchanged, there are a few new additions of course such as the FMX stunt courses and the futuristic theme which I see no problem with.\n\nAll its a solid title and a successful sequal to Evolution Gold not to be ignored. (just make sure you turn off the in-game music/commentators at the start, they get a little irritating...)\n\nAlso If you can afford to get the season pass as well then I recommend you do so, the more content the better!","April 3, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I literary fly through all the easy and medium levels, but when I start the hard ones, the game's just over for me. I have to spend hours to get one done, and have use too many checkpoints.\nEasy and medium levels I get done in one go most of the times, all gold medals, but the leap to hard is just too much for me.\n\nThat being said, the game looks amazing and the futuristic style is wonderful.\nThe addition of the tricks didn't feel all that great to me. I like the idea of it, but the excecution can be worked on. Or maybe it's my controller, I don't know.\nAdding the skill levels at the end of every chapter was new to me, too, and fun! But a lot of times it's hard to understand what they want you to do or the learning curve is to steap. I had a hard time getting trough the one where you had to do tricks before you hit the ground. My rider was flying around like a rag doll, getting stuck on every part of the bike.\nThe ATV's look great, but don't use them online! They're horrible to jump with.

After it made it into the game it immediately took me to where i can purchase more DLC when I was starting it for the first time to play it.  Maybe i'm  tired of all the games pushing DLC but there's something real annoying about a game that opens for the first time not with a cool intro movie or walk through but straight to the store page to sell you more.  I'll add more as i continue to play the game but controls seem to respond poorly.","January 2","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's just how it is. Keep playing easy tracks until you get used to how the bikes handle, THEN try the hard tracks.\n\n\n0ff that note, this game looks simple but has a lot of depth, like any other Trials game. The finesse and timing required for the harder tracks is something you won't find in almost any other game. Every little tap of the throttle, little shift of weight makes a huge difference. The gameplay is truly something to behold.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice, though they aren't particularly well-optimized. A somewhat beefy PC is required to run this game well.\n\nTrack customization is limitless; you have the same tools the developers do.\n\nFMX is my only complaint; the tricks are super unreliable.\n\nWhile not the best in the series, this is definitely a game worth playing if you have a lot of patience for difficulty.","December 5, 2015","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

I wanted more Trials, just to get rid of the shakes, but this..\nThis is most likely not the "More Trials!" you are looking for.\nPlay Trials Evloution instead, if you have not done so and/or wait for the next one, where they hopefully tune some of the stuff back to "functionaltiy over visuals".\n\nPros:\n- Graphics are amazing. Really, really pretty.\n- Still the same great Trials physics, bike handling feels almost exactly like the previous ones\n\nCons:\n- UPLAY\n-- This piece of garbage. BigPicture & COntroller -> Start any UPlay game -> Wait for Uplay updates & start looking for the mouse to click "Start". The day UPlay dies will be a happy one. Make a suicide pact with Origin please, why don't you.\n\n- Visuals over functionality\n-- Camera too often shows the scenery instead of the track you are about to land on\n-- Performance was never great with the Trials games, but because of the grat graphics and their camera work, Fusion performs HORRIBLE at times - which really sucks in a skill based "pixel perfect" thing, when you fail because of lag/hitches\n\n- "Trick Mode" is just bad. Right stick to perform stunts w/ the bike while in the air. Sounds nice, controlls horrbily. HORRIBLY.\n-- These levels are mandatory and mixed in with the normal Trials stuff and that sucks, because it just does not work well\n\n\nI like trials more than I'd normaly publicly admit to, but this.. Yes, Trials should feel frustrating.\nBut not because some Designer went "Hey stop showing so much of the track, show the background, we spent a lot of money making this!".\n\nThey essentially broke their game with that attitude, about 50% of all levels I have played have had this. I am at about halway through, and between that and the Trick stuff, this is it for me, and I am actually a bit sad about this.. I want more real Trials.. :/\n\nAlso, that intro Song.. O.o\n\nNext time, just make Trials Evloution 2, yes? Everyone will love you again and actually play your game..Thanks! :)","September 7, 2014","false","2.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Decide to play the game.\n2. uDontPlay update\n3. Launch game - unskippable logos, but that's okay they're short.\n4. Preload before the main menu. Okay, could've done that during splash screens, but okay.\n5. Connecting to Ubisoft servers.....\n6. Still connecting.\n7. Failed to connect to Ubisoft servers, hit retry,\n8. Finally connected to Ubisoft servers, yay.\n9. Browse around the menus checking for new stuff.\n10. Random freeze, Ctrl+Alt+Del => End task.\n11. Wait for uDontPlay to do some bs before it shuts down.\n12. Relaunch game, surprisingly uDontPlay hasn't been updated since then.\n13. Splash screen logos, preload, connecting to Ubisoft servers.\n14. Failed to connect to Ubisoft servers, hit retry.\n15. Go straight for playing this time, let's see the new content.\n16. Spend ~2minutes to complete the first medium map in the new pack, loving it!\n17. Autosave after the level completion takes about as much time as the level itself.\n18. Lost connection to the Ubisoft servers............. That explains it.\n19. Hit retry, twice this time, before it actually works.\n20. Back, back, back, back, quit game.\n\nThat's ~15-20 minutes of Ubisoft bullcrap to play two minutes of an otherwise solid game.\nGuess I'll try again in a couple months.... but every time I try to pick this game back up it's the same reason that makes me shelve it and that's uDontPlay.\nI'll admit, the freeze could've been a bug from Redlynx's side, but I wouldn't be surprised if Ubisoft DRM is so well integrated that it is the reason why the menus are so slow to swap inbetween to begin with.\nSetting up Excitebike on a NES emulator from scratch would probably take less time than each fresh launch of Trials through uPlay after a prolongued absence.\n\nTL;DR Great game that's close to unplayable thanks to a U shaped anchor.","March 4, 2015","false","23.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

If I hadn't gone searching in disbelief, I could easily have been fooled into thinking that this game contains no career "on-disc", so to speak.\n\nOnce i figured that out, I was puzzled that I'd gone and downloaded a free-to-play game without realizing.  It even has premium currency and expects you to buy outfits (which are also listed before the ones the game comes with).\n\nEverything about this screams money-grubbing, consumer-hating, can't-find-our-butts-with-both-hands-and-a-flashlight corporate stupidity.  I feel like I paid someone to spit in my face.\n\nMaybe the rest of the game is good, but I have no idea.  I'll never play it again.

Of course you could always just not finish the single player and move on to the custom maps but most of those are very hard aswell, so you are ♥♥♥♥ed either way.\n\nBut the real problem for me, and the reason why I don't recommend it is, the local multiplayer supercross.\nIn the prequel (trials evo) you had 10 or so standard supercross tracks and you could download a bunch of custom ones.\nIn this game, you also have 10 or so standard supercross tracks but you can't download any custom supercross maps.\nThis makes the supercross very lame very fast and is the reason why I won't buy another trials game if they don't implement it anymore.\n\nTLDR:\nIf you like a challenge and you liked the old trials evo's singleplayer maps you will really like this game.\nBut if you want to play with your friends, don't buy it and stay with evo.","June 24, 2014","false","9.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The game speed is fixed to the frame rate which I assume is because it is a (rather bad) PS / XBox port. So if the framerate drops from 60 to 40 it runs at 2/3 of the correct speed. This means that a) you need a superb gaming system (forget about the minimum requirements) and b) all comparisons to other players or friends are complete bs. This is a reaction-based game, yet anyone can just crank up the graphics and play in slow motion, taking twice as long to position the rider.

That game was very long and offered so much deversity in the modes and level design. Add the crazy amount of unique user created levels, multiplayer and you have a classic.\n\n\nCons - Fusion is a pretty short game and the heavy handed futuristic theme is off putting after a while. If I have to hear that, welcome to future song one more time, ugh! The DLC has been pretty nice but they're short levels and not worth the price. The selection of user created levels is limited and not very interesting so far. No online multiplayer and the local multiplayer is a shallow experience. The later levels get ridiculously hard.\n\nPros - It's still a Trials game and the controls are awesome. The new trick feature done with the analog sticks is a welcomed addition. The soundtrack during the levels are pretty sweet. So I still have to recommend it if you're a Trials fan, but I'd wait till i goes down in price.","November 6, 2014","true","39.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

If you have never played a trials game before then you won't understand why i think this one is a failure so go ahead and play it.)\n\nAs a standalone game this would be amazing. I'm a big fan of the Trials series (go to hell Uplay and Ubisoft with it). However this one just doesn't stand up to the previus installments.\n\nIt's clear ubisoft was trying to appeal to the "new generation" with all the techno bits and futuristic looking backdrops, which I guess is standard for Ubisoft nowadays isn't it?\n\nI really like the solid color art style in other games like portal or Mirror's Edge, but it feels kind of out of place her. That's nto to say it's completely out of place as it still works. but as a long time player I miss the gritty and harsh art style of old. Just my preference though.\n\n*Important* If you were hoping to find those unforgetably cool tracks like the one's from Evolution and HD then you will be disappointed. The tracks leave something to be desired and I breezed through all of them fairly easily. There's no Castle Crash or Gigatrack or Archipeligo. I rememebr most if nto all the tracks from Trials HD and Evolution by simply hearing the name but i couldn't even tell you the names of th first few tracks in Fusion. This is rather big for me as I really wanted the memory hook that previous tracks had given me.\n\nThey give each difficulty a general "Theme" for example the second area you unlock is supposed to be in the city but I couldn't be less enthusiastic about the environments. They just seem copy and pasted together and I turned off the audio because I didn't find "Cindy" or that pother guy i couldn't bother to remember the name of.\n\nIf this sounds like I'm calling Ubiusoft out on being the dirtbags they so desperately desire to be then you may be on to something there. But I still LIKE the game I'm just not in love with it like i was the previous ones, and if a sequal can't superceed it's predocessors then it's a failure as a sequel.\n\nBut I am sure we will see more of Trials as Ubisoft has made it clear that there are no such things as standalone games anymore.\n\nGo to hell Ubisoft and takle your piece of ♥♥♥♥ excuse for a "Client" with you\n\nAlso i would be nice if steam had a spell check, I knwo that's lazy but I'm legally blind so proof reading is too much of a hassle","June 25, 2014","false","36.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","1"

However, I cannot recommend buying this if you are looking for a good Trials game.\n\nIt is buggy, some levels are unbearably laggy (bad optimization) and the "skill games" from the previous Trials game are baaaack! And even more annoying than ever! If you want to play with keyboard, don't bother trying to do anything with those games. Ubisoft themselves wrote that they were designed for pad. But, these games are so lame that I can't be bothered configuring my pad.\n\nThe levels (when they aren't laggy) are bland. There is no challenge. I play this game when I want to wind down... It's good for that. But if you are looking for a Trials challenge, you won't find it here.\nAlso, you need to pay much more to get the other half of this game (DLC) and there is no multiplayer.","October 18, 2014","false","2.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

I have Trials HD wich i got when i bought my xbox 360, and it's one of the best games i've played, i have so many hours sunk in to that it's not even funny.\n\nThen Trials Evolution came out, and i was so happy... until i played it. And Trials Fusion is suffering from the same things that Trials Evolution was. They have gone so far from the Trials HD idea that they are just bad games now.\nIt seems like they are more focused on racing instead of the "trials" part.\nIt's not even close to have the feeling Trials HD had when getting over obstacles. Getting past obstacles in Trials HD was alot of the times skill based, but in the 2 followup games it seems that you just have to keep on trying until luck kicks in and pray to god that you are ready for it and you dont screw up.\n\nIn alot of places there is no reason in how the bike behaves so you can't plan for it, just do it over and over again until you get lcuky and guess correctly how the bike is gonna behave.\n\nIt's a sad sad story. Trials HD was soooo good and now the games just suck, they are not even fun to play anymore. I bought this in hope that it would be better than " Trials Evolution" and maybe it is, a little bit, but it's still a bad game and I officially give up hope that the "Trials" ever will be as good as they were in the beginning.

Of those there's only a few and supercross tracks are really boring and not challanging compared to trials tracks.\nThe only big change that was made to the multiplayer is, that now you always see yourself up close to the front of the supercross tracks.\n\nThe game itself has a good amount of content in the singleplayer, the trials tracks are well made. But in my opinion the feeling, which may be due to the artstyle, isn't on point. Evolution had a better art style and it fit the franchise way better.\n\nThe customisation options are just disappointing.

It is so true for the Trials series. The goal of the game is simple, to get your bike from point A to point B as fast as possible without crashing, and all the controls you have is accelerate, break, leaning forward and back. However, the game gets challenging very fast and you always want to try again just to chip a few millisecond or to manage that difficult jump.\n\nCompares to its predecessors, Fusion offer a cleaner, more futuristic setting. Some players will miss the more gritty setting of Trials Evolution. The game offers nicer lighting, some neat bloom effects, and nice post-processing effects. Overall the graphic is very beautiful and crashes are spectacular.\n\nThe game add a few new twists like being able to pull tricks with your right thumbstick. I find it a shame they add this feature and yet removed the ability to share replays on Youtube. What is the point of pulling spectacular stunts yet unable to show off to others?\n\nLikewise, there is no longer online multiplayer, which is promised again and again by the developer but no ETA is in sight. Given there are already 2 DLCs released you can tell the developer is focusing their efforts on making money instead of finishing the multiplayer feature of the game. There is local multiplayer you can play with your buddy on the same sceen.\n\nYou can also make your own tracks, and at the writing of this review there are already over two thousands user generated tracks online, and many of them are top quality and add to the longitivity of the game. Which is necessary because there are much fewer tracks than Trial Evolution Gold. Again, I feel the developers are holding off the initial release of tracks to sell them as future DLCs, which BTW at 4.99$ for 10 tracks is quite pricy.\n\nGameplay wise the official tracks are well designed but most of them are shorter than TEG. I find there are some twicks to the physics and overall a bit more forgiving than TEG. You can also make 1 or 2 faults and still get Gold on some tracks which I like because it is less frustrating, but I can see hard-core player won't like the change.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommand the game just because the overall concept is awesome. However, I don't like the business practice of the developer and would recommand you to get the game when on sale, where you can get the main game and the season pass as one package within reasonable price.","October 5, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are so much more varied and much more entertaining, and Redlynx has really realised that going for low-light environments is a terrible idea. The new levels are bright, futuristic, and so much fun to traverse.\n\nEven the soundtrack got a massive beauty treatment; Petri Alanko, famous for his work on Alan Wake, provided an absolutely astonishing lineup of music that sets the mood.","October 5, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun & addicting, unfortunately that's offset right now by a few things like Uplay and online multiplayer that doesn't seem to work.\n\nI also had some major frame-rate issues in some of the maps. I don't have the most beefy PC but I was able to run 95% of the game on high settings except for a few levels. I tried dropping to "low" to see if things would improve on just those levels but no luck. Seems to just be a part of the game and with something that requires precision, it was frustrating when a jerky framerate would mess me up.\n\nRealisticaly the uplay integration isn't too annoying once you set it up, but why can't I get Steam achievements instead of uplay achievements (or at least both)?\n\n\nIf you really dig this type of game I'd pick it up.

To say that I enjoy playing them would be the same as anyone saying they love a mouth full of cavities. I suggest that if you want to play a great Trials game then please pick up Evolution.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/holydickballs/recommended/245490/","holydickballs","MPM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/holydickballs/","206 products in account","I've always like the Trials franchise and this one isn't any different. Its pretty easy and entertaining up untill you get to the hard levels.... Then it's very frustrating but theres nothing like learning how to beat a level that has beat you so many times in the past.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful but it seems like the game isn't very well optimised or my graphics card is showing its age. I had to turn the setting to medium so it wouldn't fall under 30fps (most of the time. It still does sometimes). Another thing I noticed is that the framerate seems to effect the gameplay. When my frames would drop the game would get slower.... dunno if that means its hardcoded to the framerate or what but it was quite annoying till i lowered the settings.\n\nThe online tracks range from awesome and fun to terrible and frustrating. Some tracks are smooth where you can hit most of the jumps perfect and just makes for an enjoyable experience. On the other hand some tracks are horribly designed (understandably, these people aren't pro designers) with bad camera angles and obsticles that you basically have to have blind luck not to crash into. Another thing about online tracks is that a lot of them aren't rated correctly. You'll have tracks that are medium that should be labeled easy and some that are hard/extreme that are labeled medium.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable game if you like these type of games. At the moment it's on the humble bundle store for $9.99 which I'd say is worth it.\n\nOne other thing I forgot, it's a Ubisoft game so it requires Uplay.\nUplay is annoying\n\nEdit: One last thing I forgot to mention is that there's this bug that has been in most of the trials games where you're going up a hill and you let off the gas and lean forward and your back wheel comes off of the ground, you lose traction and fall to your doom.... I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that... Theres no physical way to actually lift your back wheel off of the ground when you're in that position....... I have no clue why they think it works like that but it is very frustrating and will (judging by it being in the last trials game too) never be fixed.","September 11, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is so true for the Trials series. The goal of the game is simple, to get your bike from point A to point B as fast as possible without crashing, and all the controls you have is accelerate, break, leaning forward and back. However, the game gets challenging very fast and you always want to try again just to chip a few millisecond or to manage that difficult jump.\n\nCompares to its predecessors, Fusion offer a cleaner, more futuristic setting. Some players will miss the more gritty setting of Trials Evolution. The game offers nicer lighting, some neat bloom effects, and nice post-processing effects. Overall the graphic is very beautiful and crashes are spectacular.\n\nThe game add a few new twists like being able to pull tricks with your right thumbstick. I find it a shame they add this feature and yet removed the ability to share replays on Youtube. What is the point of pulling spectacular stunts yet unable to show off to others?\n\nLikewise, there is no longer online multiplayer, which is promised again and again by the developer but no ETA is in sight. Given there are already 2 DLCs released you can tell the developer is focusing their efforts on making money instead of finishing the multiplayer feature of the game. There is local multiplayer you can play with your buddy on the same sceen.\n\nYou can also make your own tracks, and at the writing of this review there are already over two thousands user generated tracks online, and many of them are top quality and add to the longitivity of the game. Which is necessary because there are much fewer tracks than Trial Evolution Gold. Again, I feel the developers are holding off the initial release of tracks to sell them as future DLCs, which BTW at 4.99$ for 10 tracks is quite pricy.\n\nGameplay wise the official tracks are well designed but most of them are shorter than TEG. I find there are some twicks to the physics and overall a bit more forgiving than TEG. You can also make 1 or 2 faults and still get Gold on some tracks which I like because it is less frustrating, but I can see hard-core player won't like the change.\n\nOverall, I'd still recommand the game just because the overall concept is awesome. However, I don't like the business practice of the developer and would recommand you to get the game when on sale, where you can get the main game and the season pass as one package within reasonable price.","October 5, 2014","true","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The levels are so much more varied and much more entertaining, and Redlynx has really realised that going for low-light environments is a terrible idea. The new levels are bright, futuristic, and so much fun to traverse.\n\nEven the soundtrack got a massive beauty treatment; Petri Alanko, famous for his work on Alan Wake, provided an absolutely astonishing lineup of music that sets the mood.","October 5, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A lot of people don't like the futuristic level design of this game, and while I agree it is very different from the previous titles, I actually liked this take on it. The level design is some of the best I've seen, there was clearly a lot of work put into making the stages beautiful and it payed off.\n\nOverall, this is a really fun game, either by yourself or with friends!

That is if your lucky and it didn't time out again. in this case you ahve to retry submitting your score if you managed to get a better time.\n\nMultiplayer is local only, which means forget about all the fun you had with evolution playing supercross tracks, it doesn't exists in this game.\n\nRegardless of all the uplay crap the PC version is still a mess. Duel Screen support doesn;t work like in other games, the second screen always blacks out, so you can't do anything else while waiting for your scores to submit.\nWindow mode would have been a solution if the game could keep up the frame rates.

Its pretty easy and entertaining up untill you get to the hard levels.... Then it's very frustrating but theres nothing like learning how to beat a level that has beat you so many times in the past.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful but it seems like the game isn't very well optimised or my graphics card is showing its age. I had to turn the setting to medium so it wouldn't fall under 30fps (most of the time. It still does sometimes). Another thing I noticed is that the framerate seems to effect the gameplay. When my frames would drop the game would get slower.... dunno if that means its hardcoded to the framerate or what but it was quite annoying till i lowered the settings.\n\nThe online tracks range from awesome and fun to terrible and frustrating. Some tracks are smooth where you can hit most of the jumps perfect and just makes for an enjoyable experience. On the other hand some tracks are horribly designed (understandably, these people aren't pro designers) with bad camera angles and obsticles that you basically have to have blind luck not to crash into. Another thing about online tracks is that a lot of them aren't rated correctly. You'll have tracks that are medium that should be labeled easy and some that are hard/extreme that are labeled medium.\n\nOverall it's an enjoyable game if you like these type of games. At the moment it's on the humble bundle store for $9.99 which I'd say is worth it.\n\nOne other thing I forgot, it's a Ubisoft game so it requires Uplay.\nUplay is annoying\n\nEdit: One last thing I forgot to mention is that there's this bug that has been in most of the trials games where you're going up a hill and you let off the gas and lean forward and your back wheel comes off of the ground, you lose traction and fall to your doom.... I ♥♥♥♥ing hate that... Theres no physical way to actually lift your back wheel off of the ground when you're in that position....... I have no clue why they think it works like that but it is very frustrating and will (judging by it being in the last trials game too) never be fixed.","September 11, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the cons I will not be discussing Uplay. The DRM does cost you a few minutes in the beginning and (for other games) can be a huge pain. However, in this game, all you need to do is log in once when you first boot it up and it doesn't really bug you much after that.\n\nSo, cons\n\n>For someone with a lower-end machine, this game will kill you. As I said, great graphics, but what it did to me was reduce the framerate down to almost nothing and made the game almost unplayable due to button lag. My pc isn't terrible, either. It can play almost all games above 60fps and only goes this low for games like Next Car Game (which is an excellent game), and even for that it still gets 15-20fps.\n>Multiplayer is a pain, unlike the previous ones where it was a huge part of the experience.\n>Lack of content, which other people have commented on.\n>"Season pass," which is required to add what content the game should have had in the begining. Plus DLC, which I am generally against unless it's something like the gods and kings expansion pack. Basically, its just Ubisoft being Ubisoft.\n\nAnd thats pretty much it. If you are someone who has seen trials videos and wants to get in on it, pick Trials Evolution Gold Edition. It is better in most ways and equal when it isn't. If you have been a fan of the trials series ever since it started, go on right ahead. The main con for me is circumstantial, so if you are really dedicated you can have fun with the game despite the other flaws.\n\nEdit: Forgot about the "More on controls." Basically the only thing that I was going to say on that was that the game implemented a trick system that really doesn't contribute to the game at all. A few challenges may use it but most of the time it just gets in the way, especially during the tutorial levels.","July 2, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Local multipler has been implemented (however playing local multiplayer on a PC can be difficult) but there is no online multiplayer which is extremely dissapointing as this was one of the most fun parts of Trials evo.

Fun & addicting, unfortunately that's offset right now by a few things like Uplay and online multiplayer that doesn't seem to work.\n\nI also had some major frame-rate issues in some of the maps. I don't have the most beefy PC but I was able to run 95% of the game on high settings except for a few levels. I tried dropping to "low" to see if things would improve on just those levels but no luck. Seems to just be a part of the game and with something that requires precision, it was frustrating when a jerky framerate would mess me up.\n\nRealisticaly the uplay integration isn't too annoying once you set it up, but why can't I get Steam achievements instead of uplay achievements (or at least both)?\n\n\nIf you really dig this type of game I'd pick it up.

Trials Fusion pretty much kept what made Evolution great and added a few things to keep it from being just another Trials game. Here's my verdict.\n\nThe GOOD.\n\n-"WELCOME TO THE FUTURE....MAN, MACHINE, THE FUTURE!"...yeah MUCH better intro than "VROOM VROOM, im ready to go, time for the muh muh muh muh muh muhnday nitro!"\n\n-Trials and Tribulations: The easy to learn, hard to master gameplay is still here and still as good as its ever been.\n\n-HOLY EPIC PC PORT BATMAN!: Redlynx learned from their mistakes, a much better port than Evo was.

I've seen some complaints that the game is light on single-player content, and while it does seem pretty lean, you have to remember that Trials Evolution Gold Edition is actually a combination of two games in one, so it should have substantial more content.  Then you have the DLC, which I have yet to play or purchase, and it is disappointing that the content wasn't included in the main game.  I'm sure I'll buy the DLC eventually but I'll wait for it to go on sale.\n\nThe gameplay is much the same as its predecessors, but the UI and game progression feels more modernized with the level-up system and the addition of level challenges in the single player career mode.  Of course there's the addition of trick courses added to the arsenal, which are kind of fun but still not as much as the main game.\n\nThe environments and feel of the levels are a big change from Evolution, as Fusion sticks with a more futuristic setting.  It's a little more unnatural, but I appreciate them mixing things up, and I have to say that the environments have a ton of detail and are really pleasing to the eye.  The addition of Portal-esque humor between two robot AI characters kind of falls flat, but I still really appreciate the constant slapstick of your character rag-dolling at an end-of-level hazard.\n\nUplay is still there, but it's a non-issue.  It's never crashed my game, and I haven't had performance issues.  I also can't speak to the user-content or multiplayer as I've yet to touch it.  The core of the game remains intact, though, and there remains little more in all of gaming as satisfying as passing a seemingly impossible level in the Trials series.","May 20, 2015","true","96.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I fell in love with this series years ago on console, and for the most part this installment hasn't dissappointed me yet.  It's addictive. It's frustrating, but the feeling of satisfaction when you finally gold medal makes it worth the anger. The new FMX mode and 4-wheel drive vehicles add some slight variation to the old formula. The Community Track Creation has huge potential and some pretty good tracks have already been created, but sometimes the direction changes are clunky and completely throw off the feel of the tracks.\n\nIf your framerate drops below 60 the game goes into slow motion mode, which can get really annoying, but with a decent pc and nothing running in the background that won't usually be a problem. Every other review has taken care of complaining about Uplay for me so I won't bother.  No Online MP, Local only (Something tells me we can expect to have to buy a "Online Multiplayer DLC Pack" in the near future).  "Season Pass" seems awful pricey (it costs as much as the base game) so the devs better be planning some massive DLC packs to justify that price, otherwise I'm passing on that for now.   The Commentator Audio gets VERY repetitive if you get stuck on a track.\n\nOverall, It's enjoyable with a few small flaws that can be easily looked past. If you liked any previous Trials games, or if it's on sale, you should definately buy it.","May 3, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played the previous Trials games on the console and I was hoping that I could continue the series on PC. To an extent, I did. The gameplay was as I remember, i.e., incredibly addicting and rewarding. If you were to compare stills of this game to the previous games, you could tell it looks incredibly better. But after I got past the introductory phase, I started realising how annoying logging into Uplay was. I also ran into frame rate problems. I'm not implying that I'm running a powerful system (my graphics card being a Radeon HD 7870), but compared to the smooth 60 fps I can maintain on medium settings in Metro: Last Light and Bioshock Infinity, I found the 40 fps and often 20 fps on low settings to be COMPLETELY absurd. I'm quite offended that the developers put less care to the PC version but I suppose it's my fault for assuming otherwise from Ubisoft. Although I do enjoy playing the game on occasion, I cannot recommend it to anyone without a more powerful system. The low fps is more than nauseating as usual but actually disruptive in the gameplay. Please play the demo, which I'm very grateful is provided, before thinking of purchasing it; something I was too anxious to do.","August 14, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's never crashed my game, and I haven't had performance issues.  I also can't speak to the user-content or multiplayer as I've yet to touch it.  The core of the game remains intact, though, and there remains little more in all of gaming as satisfying as passing a seemingly impossible level in the Trials series.","May 20, 2015","true","96.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its not the best optimization I've ever seen, there's no getting around that but the gameplay itself is solid.\n\nThe problem stems not from the game itself but from the platform its on.

Of those there's only a few and supercross tracks are really boring and not challanging compared to trials tracks.\nThe only big change that was made to the multiplayer is, that now you always see yourself up close to the front of the supercross tracks.\n\nThe game itself has a good amount of content in the singleplayer, the trials tracks are well made. But in my opinion the feeling, which may be due to the artstyle, isn't on point. Evolution had a better art style and it fit the franchise way better.\n\nThe customisation options are just disappointing. You can't even adjust the colors of the parts of you bike like you could in Trials Evolution.\n\nTrials Fusion just feels like a sequel that was pushed out by Ubisoft to make some more money.\nI really trusted RedLynx after having played Trials Evolution, although the PC port was kinda bad.","January 22, 2015","false","13.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So if a particular level gets to be too frustrating you can continue on to the next level and then revisit it.\n\nThe flip side, though, is that once you finish a level and haven't received Gold you feel very compelled to retry, which is great for adding re-playability.\n\nI haven't played through completely yet, or any of the DLC but so far I'm enjoying it more than the previous Trials games which I liked as well.\n\nThere are a few levels that are difficult, mostly because the challenges are unclear. That's about the only time you can blame the game for the frustration it induces. One level in particular is the most searched variant of Trials Fusion, Trials Fusion Big Air.

It makes the game very unique and very fun. There is a plot, but you don't need to pay attention to it to enjoy this game it just gives answers to some small questions, but if you do want to know the plot it is a very good one, it's just a tad hard to follow. The game takes place in the future which is not like any of the previous games which took place in the present, so it's an interesting change in setting.\n\nCons:\n-This game is VERY difficult, not that it's a bad thing though just be prepared that once you get to the last area in this game you're gonna wanna put a bullet in your head.\n\n-The soundtrack, it's pretty "meh" the only song I really enjoyed is from the DLC, "Fire in the Deep" but sadly it's only used in that DLC to my knowledge...\n\n-The amount of DLC, it's almost comparable to some EA games which is kinda sad... come on Red Lynx... don't do dis\n\n-Requires you to play the mobile counter-part to get one costume set, of course this is just aesthetic but it still kinda annoys me that if I want a costume set I have to play their mobile games, this also leads to my next point...\n\n-MICRO-TRANSACTIONS, screw you Ubisoft... this game was fine with just regular in-game currency...\n\nPros:\n-VERY ADDICTIVE, this game is fantastic and you'll constantly come back to it wanting to collect more challenges and medals... assuming you like a challenge.\n\n-A pretty interesting and dark story, without giving anything away the story in this is pretty surprising and defiantly adds a dark twist to the game... you can even find out more to the story through the mobile version of the game, "Trials Frontier".\n\n-Very good setting, compared to Trials Evolution this setting is way better in that it is much more colorful and lively.\n\n-Added more content than the last game, this game now includes tricks, a quad-bike, and actual characters unlike the last iteration.\n\n-With the exception of the first DLC, "Riders of the Rustlands" all of the DLC is fantastic and develops the story even more.\n\nVerdict: 8/10\n\nI think many of the negative reviews are too focused on comparing this game to the previous one and UPlay, which in all honesty, UPlay is not bad at all you just have to make an account and log in and you're set.\n\nIf you like a challenging physics-based games I would strongly suggest you pick this up, it's defiantly worth it.","July 31, 2015","true","70.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cool, really atmospheric tracks with some tricky jumps and spots that made me feel accomplished when I got over them. One level in the desert world Is entirely silhouetted with a beautiful orange sunset in the back. It was a great game to throw on some headphones, listen to music, and zone out to. Then, I hit the hard levels and the difficulty seemed to spike without warning. It became less of zoning out with a few interesting and well designed challenges to jumps you could only just barely make that didn't give you any satisfaction to finish. And then the extreme worlds. They're ♥♥♥♥ing wretched. At this point, the game stops being clever with its design and just relies on its extremely imprecise controls to simulate difficulty, to a rage inducing point. Its simply not fun. I can't reccomend this game, as you will find yourself getting more and more upset with the controls. Why would you make bunny hop, a very crucial skill later in the game, such an imprecise trick? 75% of the time I tried to bunny hop it resulted in flinging myself into an unwanted front or backflip. I'm sorry, but you can't fall back on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls to act like your game is super tough rewarding experience. Save yourself the rage and frustration, and look elsewhere.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skullboy99/recommended/245490/","Skullboy99","Skullboy99","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skullboy99/","99 products in account","Ok so, I made a review for this game back at its launch, when things were still being fixed, as well as lots of features were missing, so now I feel like would be a good time to give Trials Fusion a full review.\n\nI'm going to be using "Acorns" as points for pros and cons, and then if we still have points after the cons, then the game will automatically be recommended. I'm using acorns because of the awesome squirrel in Trials Evolution, plus, Why not, ACORNS ARE AWESOME.\n\nPROS:\nMore Content to play and enjoy  (+ 1/2 Acorns)  With Trials Fusion having so much DLC, it can make the game have lots of replay value, but it can also cause LOTS of problems, but I'll save that for the cons.\n\nMultiplayer  (+ 1/2 Acorns)  Although it took almost a year for RedLynx to add multiplayer into Trials Fusion, the Multiplayer turned out pretty great, and is a lot of fun to play with other people on it! Which this receives a 1/2 because of how long it took for this feature to show up.\n\nGood Gameplay  (+ 1 Acorn)  With their previous games, Trials HD and Trials Evolution, the gameplay always felt smooth and done just perfectly, but somehow, Trials Fusion managed to become much more smoother than their previous titles. From simply accelerating and moving your rider back and forth, it just feels like there is a lot more effort put into it.\n\nGreat Graphics  (+ 1 Acorn)  When Trials Fusion launched, the graphics were really great compared to Trials Evolution and so on. The rocks, the bikes, the rider's clothing, the objects, they look much more high definition and much more detailed, and surprisingly, the game still manages to look great on the Low graphics setting, so good job to them for that!\n\nAdvanced Track Editor  (+ 1 Acorn)  Comparing the advanced track editor of Trials Evolution to Trials Fusion, is absolutley insane, because Trials Fusion's Track editor is so much more advanced, the things that people manage to make with it is amazing. From remaking Minecraft, to making a First person parkour level, its very incredible, with the amount of tools and creativity the Track Editor gives you.\n\nSame Formula, Same Game  (+ 2 Acorns)  Most of the sequels some of the game creators make, they usually add something new to the game, which ends just ruining the whole game. Although with Trials Fusion, RedLynx knew what made the game so successful in the first place, so they kept pretty much everything the same; Driving from point A to point B while doing many obstacles.\n\nTOTAL ACORNS SO FAR: 6  =================================================================\nCONS:\nAdding multiplayer very late  (-1/2 Acorns)  Something that was so frustrating with Trials Fusion, is that the game lacked multiplayer, which is a feature that many people enjoyed on Trials Evolution, so because of this, many people would still play Trials Evolution. Although they eventually added it (at a rather late time), so you gotta give them credit I guess.\n\nMicrotransactions  (-1/2 Acorns)  With RedLynx adding Microtransactions, the only way you can buy the new clothes/new parts for bikes they update the game with, you have to pay with acorns, which the only way to earn those is by either paying money, or beating certain challenges, which I guess its good they have a way to earn these acorns without paying money, and because of that, this feature only loses half an acorn.\n\nRequirement for Uplay  (-1/2 Acorns)  Although this isn't really that big of an issue anymore, Trials Fusion requires Uplay, and personally I think having to download another DRM is ridiculous, especially if I bought this game ON steam. I bought it to play on steam, not Uplay.\n\nLOTS of random issues/crashes  (-1 Acorns)  Even though this game is mainly not that bad, one of the biggest and most annoying issues is the game either crashes a lot or there is just so many issues. From no textures/models/menus loading, to the game just randomly crashing for no reason, its very annoying, although it could just be on my end, since my PC is pretty oudated.\n\nLocked Community levels due to not owning DLC  (-2 Acorns)  This is probably one of my biggest problems of all, If you don't own any DLC, then you pretty much cant play any of the current tracks in the "Track Central". They could have at least made all of the objects for the level editor free, in this case, it would allow so much more creativity and many more opportunities, but with this huge barrier in the way, its overall made the Track Central a worse place, which is probably the most active place in Trials Fusion.\n\nTOTAL ACORNS NOW: 4 1/2  =================================================================\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nWith there being more pros than cons, this obviously means that regardless of the issues, you will still manage to have such a fun time on the game, if you enjoyed the previous Trials games. Although here is probably the biggest question of all; Which is better, Trials Evolution, or Trials Fusion? and my answer to that is neither, they both have their ups and downs, they both manage to shine and become successful the equal amount.\n\nIf you want a score for Trials Fusion, then I would rate it 7/10.","October 11, 2015","true","315.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Npw, i know people feel as if this is a terrible game, but, i find it very amusing. i like the graphics, and i really like the courses. trials fusion is the successor to trials evolution, witch may people like far better. havin never played evolution (which i will buy the gold edition) i wouldnt really know. but i am not to crazy over the futuristic idea of it, but it definitely captures the core gameplay of the trials series. the gameplay is deceptively simple.\nyou have to drive your bike down a sidescrolling track and balance yourself by shifting your riders weight left and right.\nthe game is 2.5d meaning that you are on a 2d track, but the rendering is 3d. you can only go forwards and backwards, but trials has such an addicting nature that you keep playing. overall 9/10","June 18, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cool, really atmospheric tracks with some tricky jumps and spots that made me feel accomplished when I got over them. One level in the desert world Is entirely silhouetted with a beautiful orange sunset in the back. It was a great game to throw on some headphones, listen to music, and zone out to. Then, I hit the hard levels and the difficulty seemed to spike without warning. It became less of zoning out with a few interesting and well designed challenges to jumps you could only just barely make that didn't give you any satisfaction to finish. And then the extreme worlds. They're ♥♥♥♥ing wretched. At this point, the game stops being clever with its design and just relies on its extremely imprecise controls to simulate difficulty, to a rage inducing point. Its simply not fun. I can't reccomend this game, as you will find yourself getting more and more upset with the controls. Why would you make bunny hop, a very crucial skill later in the game, such an imprecise trick? 75% of the time I tried to bunny hop it resulted in flinging myself into an unwanted front or backflip. I'm sorry, but you can't fall back on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ controls to act like your game is super tough rewarding experience. Save yourself the rage and frustration, and look elsewhere.

The game was great on release, i thought. It has some interesting new content and game modes and I really enjoyed the tracks and environment, as well as the map editor. HOWEVER, things changed. This games content is pretty much hidden behind a paywall. The season pass also doesn't even get you all of the DLC and there are micro transactions. Multiplayer took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to show up, and the content sharing system is ♥♥♥♥. This game could have been so much more than what it turned into. ♥♥♥♥ing Ubisoft needs to get away from small developers or rethink their entire business practice, as they clearly don't develop/publish games for the gamers.\n\n____________________\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nThe trials games are some of the best games out there in my opinion. They can be great fun if you're not all that great, but take a very long time to master. They provide a lot of good entertainment and have a great community for custom tracks, with near endless possiblities (similar to SC 2 Arcade.) This game continues to deliver. There's a lot of new Rider and Bike customization options which are very fun to mess with.\n\nThey made Fusion much more competative with friends, too. You are notified if a high score is one upped by a friend, and if you beat a friend it will notify both you and them. You are able to watch replays of all learderboard times which is cool for comparisons or learning tricks. The new challenge system adds 3 challenges to every track that comes with the game. These can make for really hard, but also really entertaining events to each track, or just a little challenge like completing flips.\n\nThe physics in this game are spot on and I have not found any game that can match the quality. HOWEVER. Ubisoft bought out RedLynx and have inserted Uplay into the question. Uplay is an awful DRM, and requires constant connectivity in order to play any game. Ubisoft tends to have horrible service and I have grown to dislike them greatly recently but that's not why we're here.\n\nPros\n-Very fun\n-Well polished\n-Beautiful New Art Style\n-Lots of tracks\n-Challenges to keep you busy and entertained\n-Multiplayer Local, and Online in a future update.\n-Tricks can be a very fun addition\n\nCons\n-Uplay\n-Can be VERY frustrating\n-Ubisoft\n-Occasional Frame Drops\n-Crashes if menu is navigated too quickly sometimes\n-and uplay\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like physics based Bike Racing, Couch Gaming, have patience, and have a good internet connection. I love the trials games, and this one (besides uplay) has not disappointed me at all.","April 24, 2014","false","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

The game was great on release, i thought. It has some interesting new content and game modes and I really enjoyed the tracks and environment, as well as the map editor. HOWEVER, things changed. This games content is pretty much hidden behind a paywall. The season pass also doesn't even get you all of the DLC and there are micro transactions. Multiplayer took for ♥♥♥♥ing ever to show up, and the content sharing system is ♥♥♥♥. This game could have been so much more than what it turned into. ♥♥♥♥ing Ubisoft needs to get away from small developers or rethink their entire business practice, as they clearly don't develop/publish games for the gamers.\n\n____________________\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nThe trials games are some of the best games out there in my opinion. They can be great fun if you're not all that great, but take a very long time to master. They provide a lot of good entertainment and have a great community for custom tracks, with near endless possiblities (similar to SC 2 Arcade.) This game continues to deliver. There's a lot of new Rider and Bike customization options which are very fun to mess with.\n\nThey made Fusion much more competative with friends, too. You are notified if a high score is one upped by a friend, and if you beat a friend it will notify both you and them. You are able to watch replays of all learderboard times which is cool for comparisons or learning tricks. The new challenge system adds 3 challenges to every track that comes with the game. These can make for really hard, but also really entertaining events to each track, or just a little challenge like completing flips.\n\nThe physics in this game are spot on and I have not found any game that can match the quality. HOWEVER. Ubisoft bought out RedLynx and have inserted Uplay into the question. Uplay is an awful DRM, and requires constant connectivity in order to play any game. Ubisoft tends to have horrible service and I have grown to dislike them greatly recently but that's not why we're here.\n\nPros\n-Very fun\n-Well polished\n-Beautiful New Art Style\n-Lots of tracks\n-Challenges to keep you busy and entertained\n-Multiplayer Local, and Online in a future update.\n-Tricks can be a very fun addition\n\nCons\n-Uplay\n-Can be VERY frustrating\n-Ubisoft\n-Occasional Frame Drops\n-Crashes if menu is navigated too quickly sometimes\n-and uplay\n\nI highly recommend this game if you like physics based Bike Racing, Couch Gaming, have patience, and have a good internet connection. I love the trials games, and this one (besides uplay) has not disappointed me at all.","April 24, 2014","false","37.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

First off this game Trials Fusion is like a stretched out version of Trials Evolution which is a way better Trials Instalment. The online gaming feature is only leaderboard competion's. You wont find anybody to play with and if you do it's just the  two of you. good luck also if the connection stays long enough to finish the 4 seperate tracks you usually play people against. I have to say that they really dropped a butload of fecies onto the Trials franchise with this instalment. Most interesting part of the game is the Creator Mode. That has been my top reason for coming back to Trials Fusion. Second reason is 2 Extreme rated tracks I have not yet completed.  Game is not worth whatever they sell it for, unless it's $5.00 for the whole game and DLC Season Crap and whatever all in one. Should be made into a free to play game.  - 6/10","November 24, 2015","false","129.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have been waiting to write this review since the I purchased Trials Fusion. I have now put 103 hours into Trials Fusion and I can finally say I have 100% completed the career. The emotional roller coaster I experienced while playing this game is unfathomable. Anger, joy, sadness. etc. the list continues for more words than are in my vocabulary. I'm sure that by this point my blood pressure is that of a 87 year old chain smoker, yet I don't mind. The satisfaction from completing a level or even improving a previous record is such an enlightening feeling. The rage and hatred that was once there is replaced by an abundance of good emotions. You battle no one but yourself, it is all a battle of your own skill. It takes away from the competitive nature of so many games and brings you back to the basics of what a game should be, frustrating beyond belief but satisfying.
