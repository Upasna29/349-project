The VR-Integration feels pretty weird as a first person shooter where you move the gun with your head - that part works surprising well though.\nWhat doesnt work well is overall game. You get thrown into the labyrith with a gun and have to try to get through. No explaination of the game - nothing. There is no proper tutorial. You have no idea what the UI is supposed to convey.\nYou seem to have a couple different skills but those are only oneshot or tied to some energy-meter i wasnt able to recognize. Also your ammo seems to be limited to what you have in your gun. i couldnt find a reload button or anything like that.\nAdditionally there was almost no game-sound for me which feels really weird for a stealth game.\nOverall i can't recommend this game. If it was an alpha or beta and prone to change maybe - but not as a finished product.","April 29","false","0.2"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","25","38","0","4"

Took a moment to familiarize with with the interface and the environment, until i realized that I have to close my left eye to perfectly aim with the gun, alignin with the crosshair.\nI could then shoot lights and robots and it felt completely natural.\nDefinitely recommended!","April 29","true","0.5"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","0"

Automatic No in my book for any PC game.\n\nSecond is VR specific and that is aiming is locked to your neck. There are no options to decouple aiming from your vision to your mouse.\n\nImmediate refund, this is not a VR game. This is a flatscreen game dumped into an HMD.","May 10","false","0.1"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

You can destroy lights to conceal yourself in the dark, and use a stun gun to shoot out cameras and sentry robot guards.\n+ Pretty good level design. Each level seems to be a rather huge map / robotic facility that is filled with dozens of varying rooms to explore.\n+ The Terminator-like design of the guard robots can be pretty intimidating and somewhat scary at times when they come around a corner.\n+ Multiple stealth abilities, like seeing electronics through walls, night vision, EMP blast, and so on.\n\n- Very limited ammo / ability charge causing you to be extremely conservative. Typically, if you run out of ammo you are screwed.\n- Overly challenging... It seems like you get detected from overly long distances, and die extremely quickly\n- No context, story, or characters.... the goal just seems to be collect data without dying...\n- Feels repetitive, mainly due to the difficulty and that you will be replaying the same area repetitively while not making too much progress as you will die a lot.\n- You apparently can not play with a controller without a VR headset\n- Lacks ambient sounds / music, very quiet most of the time","May 20","false","5.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"
