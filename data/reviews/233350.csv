The “but” comes from a handful of mitigating factors: it’s fun, but easy; interesting, but derivative; initially engaging, but soon begins to feel rushed. Every positive facet of Sudeki comes with an accompanying drawback.\n\nThe “if,” of course, is that if you like action-RPGs, there is nothing in Sudeki that will actually harsh your mellow. It’s not a bad example of its genre by any stretch of the imagination, and is often really entertaining despite its flaws, presuming that you like the genre in the first place.\n\nSudeki is set on a world of the same name, which warring gods have split into opposing realms of light and shadow. The game begins in the kingdom of Illumina in the Light realm, where a soldier named Tal splits his time between defending the countryside from berserk Shadow monsters, flirting with the princess Ailish, getting yelled at by his father, and being the lone survivor of any mission he’s sent on.\n\nIn the aftermath of a battle, the god Tetsu appears to Tal, and lets him know that an end is coming; the current troubles between the Light and Shadow worlds are just the beginning of a larger struggle. Tal, Ailish, a demihuman warrior named Buki, and Illumina’s head scientist Elco have been chosen by the gods to combat the forces of the Realm of Shadows, whether they like it or not.\n\nSudeki will frequently allow you to control at least two of your characters simultaneously. Like Knights of the Old Republic, any PC who’s not under your direct control at the moment is controlled by the CPU; unlike KOTOR, you move your active character in real-time. Tal and Buki are short-ranged melee fighters, controllable in third-person and attacking via a timing-based combo system, while during a fight, Ailish and Elco move and shoot in first person.\n\nYou can switch between the members of your current group at any time using the Black button, which is excellent for micromanaging difficult battles. Each character brings a unique mix of skills and statistics to the table; Tal is basically a meatshield, Buki is a mobile attacker, Ailish wields spells and high-damage magical staves (one of her later weapons is not so much a magical cane as a two-shot rocket launcher), and Elco provides covering fire using a variety of pistols.\n\nThe fun of Sudeki is largely in the combat. A battle’s usually a chaotic melee, full of flying projectiles, charging opponents, devastating spells, and unpleasant surprises. A lot of people have claimed that Sudeki is a button-masher, and if you want, you can hammer on attack buttons all damn day. If that’s your kick, go to it.\n\nThe reality is that Sudeki's combo system is actually designed to punish button-mashing. Tal and Buki’s melee combos depend largely on timing, forcing you to land two quick hits in preparation for a devastating finisher or a series of juggles. Anyone who’s trying to get through the game just by hammering on X or A isn’t going to do as well as a player who studies opponents, looks for an opening, and lays into them with a careful string of hits.\n\nMeanwhile, Ailish and Elco’s job is to hang back from the melee and rain death upon anyone who isn’t looking. The more powerful their weapons, the more recharge time they’ll generally have between shots, which means you’ll need to dodge and weave to stay on your feet. Once again, you can just hold down the trigger and spray death at your enemies, but the low hit strength of the weapons with a high rate of fire means that you’re really spraying minor annoyance.\n\nOut of combat, each character has a further unique ability which allows you to discover secrets and solve puzzles. Tal can push around local designated Shoving Objects, such as crates. Buki can climb up walls using her claws, Elco’s rocket pack lets him fly as long as there’s a yellow crystal handy to power it, and Ailish possesses Second Sight, allowing her to penetrate and dispel illusions.\n\nWhen you level up, you can spend advancement points to raise each characters’ stats and teach them up to six skills. In villages, you can further improve a character by welding magical runes to his armor or weapons, providing power boosts, special abilities, or immunity to status attacks. (The latter’s important, since everyone and their mom in Sudeki can inflict status ailments on your party. It’s not unusual to have two or three going at once.)\n\nThis is usually the point where I ineptly segue into discussing a game’s flaws, but aside from some dodgy character design (I hope you like Buki’s ♥♥♥, because thanks to the gods of Sudeki, you’ll be staring at it for a long time), Sudeki plays just fine. The biggest problem it has is that there isn’t enough of it.\n\nFor one thing, Sudeki is dead easy. Part of this is because Elco gets his best weapon about four hours into the game. With a little work and a few levels, he’ll be popping conventional enemies like a grape with one or two shots. This comes in handy, since Elco gets one of the hardest fights in the game all to himself -- Sudeki’s bosses always seem to contrive a method to make sure you fight them one-on-one – but it also means that any group with Elco in it skates through combat.\n\nYou can also easily get all the best skills early on, since none of the spells or abilities in Sudeki come with a prerequisite. You can easily grab all the stat-boosting or protective skills first thing, then use them at the start of any fight to stack the odds in your favor.\n\nIn addition, any given boss can be defeated with the use of a simple trick, which looks more like a glitch than anything else. Every time you use a skill, your character enters an invulnerability window that lasts until the end of the move. There’s at least one boss fight where you can completely ignore all of its attacks and instantly counter, as long as you keep casting spells.\n\nCombine that with a few runes, some decent weapons, and Ailish’s tendency to obliterate anyone who looks at her funny with Celestial Circle, and Sudeki's main characters wind up looking less like heroes and more like exterminators.\n\nIn addition to being easy, Sudeki is ridiculously short, clocking in at twenty-five hours max. For a game that was purported to be the first real epic RPG on Xbox, this is almost incomprehensible.\n\nPlaying through the endgame, one wonders if Sudeki was meant to be far longer, but was rushed to completion. Many plot threads are abandoned or tossed aside, including a major life-changing event right before the final battle. Both Tal and Ailish have major issues that simply aren’t resolved, involving his father and her mother, and Elco is the focus of a major plot twist right before the finale that, unfortunately, doesn’t wind up meaning anything.\n\nIt’s a fun game, and it’s not a bad game, but it’s over right when most RPGs are just getting started.\n\nRecommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","February 24, 2014","true","52.7"," 271 of 321 people (84%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","84","271","321","5","6"

It has pretty decent graphics (it is an almost 10 year old game) and the gameplay is engaging and fun. You go through a quest that gets bigger and more complicated as you continue. You pick up sidequests as you go along. The combat is fun, too. It is an action RPG and as you get more playable characters and skills, things become more challenging.\n\nIncredibly, the game reminded me a lot of Landstalker for the sega genesis. The reason is because the game world is so beautiful and well put together. Each town has a destinctive look and feel and even seems alive. Also, the pacing is just right with a progression that feels natural and is interesting.\n\nOverall, I was suprised at how deep the game is. It has virtually everything you could want from an RPG.\n\nOne other note: the game is amazingly optimized for PC. The loadtimes which I assume existed on the console are eliminated on PC. The game worked great with keyboard and mouse, but I prefer playing with the gamepad. Also, the graphics options are easily accessible and modifiable.","October 26, 2014","true","5.0"," 68 of 70 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","68","70","0","0"

He narrates certain parts of the game and also voices one of the characters - not a main character, but an NPC that shows up here and there throughout the game (Tetsu). When I learned that, I had to pick it up immediately, regardless of whether the game was any good or not. Aside from the fourth Doctor, the game is also fully voiced with cutscenes, NPC chatter, and dialogue options.\n\nSudeki is from 2005 and it shows. The graphics are a bit primitive, about the same level as World of Warcraft, although the art style is different. It has a more Asian vibe. It's actually a very pretty game, with bright colors, dazzling particle effects, and great character designs.\n\nIt's also an obvious console port, with no mouse control within menus, a checkpoint save system, and limited options. The default POV is third person with no Y axis control, but certain skills require first-person view which does allow you full X & Y angle control. Ranged characters play in first-person by default during combat, then switch back to third-person when moving around out of combat.\n\nCombat is fluid, and plays differently for each character. Some have combo moves which aren't too complicated (L/R/L, L/L/L, R/L/L, etc.), others have various weapons you can switch between during combat for various effects. There are also spells and special powerup moves you can activate. Combat pauses while you select these from a menu, and they include cutscene style animations with epic effects. This makes it feel a bit like a turn-based RPG like Final Fantasy VII when you trigger those off, which is kind of fun.\n\nThere are shops and save checkpoints scattered around here and there. Weapons and armor can be upgraded with runes to add various effects like damage shield on armor, or extra crit chance on weapons, things of that nature. The game-world is composed of corridors divided by zones. There is no jumping, and sometimes you might encounter an invisible wall where it looks like you should be able to go a certain direction, but you can't. In this way, the setup reminds me a bit of Kingdom of Amalur. You can go almost anywhere, although some areas are blocked off until you unlock them through the story.\n\nSpeaking of the story, it's actually quite good. The characters are interesting, there are quite a few subtle jokes and innuendos thrown in here and there, and it has a lot of personality. I didn't want to stop playing but alas, sleep beckons. I look forward to playing through some more, as the game is actually quite fun. For the price, it's very solid entertainment. You just have to overlook the dated graphics and console feel.\n\nI'll update my review if I discover anything that changes it but so far I'm really impressed.","February 24, 2014","true","3.3"," 68 of 82 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","68","82","0","0"

For $5, you will not regret it.\n\nLong Story: It a good mix of both West and J-RPG essentially. The game has flaws, yes; but at the same time it oozes charm, humour and plain enjoyment every step of the way.\n\nThe real selling point IS “Sudeki”, the world itself. The environments are varied and exploring around the Palace and the countryside will make you wish you could spend a summer visiting and living in the game world. And to top it off there is a great soundtrack that gives each town and village a sense of identity.  I sometimes just sit and listen to the music, it’s that good.\n\nThe story, though it has cliques, has its twists and turns and it’s interesting enough to keep exploring the world. And has almost a Disney-esque feel to it: hopeful and silly sometimes and then surprisingly dark other times. Voice acting is not always great, but you will find characters you love and characters you hate.\n\nGameplay is ok, if a bit repetitive and linear. Good enemy variety, simplistic combo system and RPG customisation for weapons and two ranged and two melee characters to switch during combat. Oh and class specific spells.\n\nI'm very happy they finally got this game on the Steam Library. I played it as a kid and loved it and even today I come back to it every 2 years or so and do a playthrough. I was very sad when I found out the sequel got canned, but Sudeki easily stands on its own. Now if you’ll excuse me I’ll be in New Brightwater, smashing crates and listening to the soundtrack :)","February 24, 2014","true","24.0"," 56 of 70 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","56","70","0","0"

LOL. xD Now here it is, ON STEAM! OMG. Sorry, I'm just a little hyped. :P I can finally finish the game! :)\n\nOk, so the game is a really good Action RPG. The controls are pretty much like most Action RPGs so if you played games like Fable you should be able to get used to this fairly quick. And the 360 controller support is a plus.\nThe graphics are very nice considering this was originally released in 2004 on the Xbox and 2005 on PC.\n\nIf you like Action RPGs with a somewhat Japanese Fantasy style to it then you will like this game, and for the price of $4.99 USD, it's worth the experience. :)\n\nEdit: After comparing some of the files I had managed to salvage and backed up from the original UK disc version, I noticed that the video cutscenes were enchanced for the Steam version to support higher resolution displays.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zjstratton/recommended/233350/","zjstratton","Bjord Svenson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zjstratton/","117 products in account","Sudeki is a real time action rpg with a little bit of everything.\n\nSet in a fantasy medieval era where two nations are at war, you play as a protagonist named Tal who assembles a party of somewhat unique characters that must learn to trust each other to meet their individual goals.\n\nOf the four main playable characters, two are melee and two are ranged. Melee characters perform combos to attack, ranged characters have a FPS POV. Every character has their own skills that are almost identical to the others such as line, arc, and AOE, but also have unique powerful skills of their own.\n\nCombat is clunky but is not hard to get used to. Once the player understands how to coordinate attacks and abilities between multiple characters combat becomes easy. Very easy unfortunately. However it is still very fun because the game throws multiple different types of enemies and enemy compositions at you that successfully winning with little to no damage taken feels rewarding. The player must learn to adapt to situations where they do not have a full party, are playing as a single character in some encounters, and during dreaded escort missions  (thankfully there is only one but it is very painful).  One great aspect of combat is the ability to actively switch between different weapons. This allows you to use weapons that have increased damage at times when you need to burst, or when you need to steal life or mana, or dispel magic from enemies. Overall, combat in Sudeki is good and unique but has some balancing problems. For me the game shines in it's exploration.\n\nThe world is small but offers a lot of variety. Landscapes are cool, bursting with treasure to find, npc's to talk to that occasionally offer quests or information about the world. Dungeons are very much labyrinths that can be confusing to navigate along with some puzzles that range from ridiculously easy to one in particular that took me a solid 20 minutes to figure out.\n\nFor $6.00 I recommend this game to anyone at least willing to try it for 2 hours before deciding on finishing the game. A playthrough is short, clocking in between 15-20 hours.\n\nAs with all old games you have to play knowing the era. For 2005 everything is decent but lags behind. Compared to Fable which was released a year prior, the graphics and voice acting are a little dull.\n\n7/10.\n\nPros\n\nFun combat\nFully voice acted\nRewarding exploration\nDecent story with minor pacing issues, but plot twists that keep it interesting\nClassic RPG style with unique elements\nCons\n\nLoose ends, ending feels rushed\nMinor bugs that require the need to have several save files\nToo few bosses\nVery little replay value\nSome dull quests\n\n\n\n","September 26, 2015","true","20.7"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","1"

It wasn't till much later that I actually got the chance to play it. I have to say though if they had released this on the Playstation 2, I would have been all over it.\n\nSudeki is a unique RPG in that it doesn't follow your typical JRPG formula. Being a British based company, Climax Studios brought something new and different to the US during it's initial release. While at it's core it still feels like a role playing game, Sudeki also contains elements of third-person, action, adventure, shooter, and even first-person shooter games. The voice acting can be a little campy at times, but sadly most games during that generation had the same problem, fortunately it is tolerable. I do have to admit, the graphics and shaders still look really good, unlike other games that do not age so well. I'm pretty sure they were able to add a lot more to the PC version(because, you know, PC MASTER RACE), because it shows, and it has aged well.\n\nAt least until we get to the point where we blur the lines between reality and virtual reality, where our brains won't be able to tell the difference... Then you can run a Sudeki emulator to play it, and wonder how we used to play these types of games. Until then, give this one a shot.

It will run perfectly if you do a few things first. I am running windows 7\n\nhere is how to get the game running on your PC for people running Windows XP, vista, 7 or newer OS systems, provided you were experiencing the same compatibility issues i was. (I hope steam will post this in the game descriptions also)\n\n1. Buy and install the game from steam ( i highly reccomend this game i had it for xbox it was awsome)\n\n2. after you install the game go to your folder directories or whatever folder where you install your games, my folder for my games for example is...Computer--Local Disk (C:)--Program Files (x86)--New Folder--SteamApps--common--\n\n3. Find your folder file that is titled Sudeki and locate your Sudeki.exe file\n\n4. Then you right click on it with your mouse and click Properties\n\n5. Next click on your compatibilty tab and check mark the box to run inWindows98/WindowsME mode. Then click apply.\n\n6. Now go back in your Sudeki program files and locate your SudekiLauncher.exe file follow the same procedure as listed in steps 4 and 5.\n\n7.Once done with that go back into your Sudeki program files and locate the folder _CommonRedist, click on the folder that says DirectX, then click onthe folder that says June2010 and locate your DXSETUP application file. Now when you locate that file follow the same steps as mentioned in steps 4 and 5.\n\n8. Next goback into your _CommonRedist folder and locate the folder vcredist click on that folder, then click on the folder 2010, then locate your vcredist_x64 application and follow the same steps as listed in steps 4 and 5.\n\n9.After that locate your vcredist_x86 application and follow the steps listed insteps 4 and 5.\n\n10. Now exit completely out of your files, click on the icon to start your game and enjoy playing your game. If you did your steps right as mentioned your game will run smoothly\n\nI am going to immensly enjoy this game I hope you do to.\n\nI can recommend this game without even playing it. i had this game on xbox. one of the more decent rpg games for the original xbox. i loved the game. the graphics were great and the plot is well written. It is a great game plenty of action plenty of exploration. i logged some serious hours when i had it on xbox. i am super excited i bought it for PC.

That isn't a bad thing, the game is old and there isn't a reason to update all the graphics and what not just because you are putting it on Steam now. The game has been avilable on the PC before.\n\nThe game has it's flaws, but it is still a good game. I finished the game in a little over 10 hours without doing side quests. It says I have 9.7 or what ever, but I had a save file about 40 minuets in from when I had it on the PC before hand but never got around to playing it. So it is kinda short, but I am glad it had enough for the time it took, and didn't drag the game on longer then it needed.\n\nThe combat in Sudeki is a little varied, but not a whole lot. The two ranged people and the two melee people play kinda the same as each other, just with different active abilities and weapons. There is a combo system for the melee attackers and the ranged just shoot the crap out of people who get too close.\n\nI had this game on the xbox as well a long time ago and I never finished it, got about 3/4ths of the way through. Since I hadn't played it for a while and liked it so much back then, I hyped it up in my mind when it came to Steam to the point I thought it was amazing. Sudeki is good, just not amazing. It needs a good polish to fix some of the problems, like getting trapped in the corner in combat and it glitching you during combat cutscenes. The latter example happened to me during a boss fight and it broke the game to the point where I had to reload, so save often encase more problems pop up.\n\nI would recomend this game for 5 dollars, or even 10. I think it was still a good game and I hope that other people do as well.\n\nSide note: To those who can't get it to run for what ever reason, it is on your side not Steams since I booted it up without a problem every time I played.","March 1, 2014","true","9.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ukjohndoe/recommended/233350/","ukjohndoe","John","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ukjohndoe/","220 products in account","This is a decent Action RPG. I'd recommend it for anyone out there looking for a simple ARPG if you're not afraid of a few ugly 3D models. It's not my place to criticize the character design but they're a bit over-the-top and heavily influenced by anime, not that it matters but this game is not japanese.\n\nThis game was one of the handful of RPGs that Microsoft made with interest of slipping the Xbox console into the Japanese market. While the game was not a commercial success, what we ended up having was easily a fantastic RPG on Xbox and even though it's been out for PC for quite a while, it's such an obscure game that nobody really noticed it much and now we have it on Steam and I couldn't be happier.\n\nThe story, as well as the characters are somewhat forgetable, but it's got amazing scenery, the style of the world is similar to Fable and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Very colorful, full of fantastic devices and monuments and very green with lots of vegetation too.\nThe gameplay is the most important element in this game: it's fluid and it gives you a few choices, you can play an action hack-and-slash type of character or a First Person Shooter type.\nYou get 4 characters to play with, all play together in the battlefield but you take control of one while AI takes over the others. 2 of them use Melee (Hack-and-Slash) and the other 2 use long range attacks (FPS).\nEach of them has different skills and combos and you can enter a slow-motion mode when you go through the skills and pick one to use, so the game never truly feels like it comes to a halt. This makes things stay interesting for a while.\n\nI could go on and on about who's who and what each character does but honestly, it's not that important, just know they're all very different in their style even if their gameplay is similar. Combos are different, they use different weapons, skills are definitely very very different so you'll have favorites. Also, all their one-liners are SUPER CHEESY so you can't escape those either way.\nThe voice acting is not very good, you can see it's not a big budget game but these fantasy RPG type of games are TEXT-HEAVY so the voice acting is basically cutscenes and one-liners.\n\nOn the technical aspect of the port: I am playing with an official Xbox 360 Gamepad and it's playing really GOOD, no complaints on the controller scheme, it's basically the same as back on the Xbox (although it's been almost 8 years so...don't quote me on that). The only problem I see is how the game text uses  "Button1" and "Button2" instead of labeling it "X" and "A", but that's not a big deal.\nI'm not on the high-end of PC gaming but I can run this game fine and so far I've seen no issues with widescreen or sudden crashes (from a bit of play-testing) and the frames per second seem fine too, I do see some issues with vertical sync but it doesn't take away from the experience. I do wish there were some mods for this though, some 2D art and 3D models are ugly (my opinion) and I'd love to change them.\n\nAlthough it is not some sort of hidden underrated gem, it's definitely a good game that didn't get enough attention and I'm sure most sales for this will be nostalgia-induced, and that's not necesarily a bad thing. It's based on something real good, enough to stay in your mind and make you want to play it again.","July 5, 2014","true","1.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I must have bought it, or had it given to me, but I really don't know where I got it. I vaguely remember a game by that name for (I think) the Xbox, which I didnt own. Having gamed since 1984, I can tolerate old games better than some, so I fired it up.\n\nI noticed it has many positive reviews, mostly it seems from people who remember it back on Xbox. I didnt play it back then, so theres no nostalga factor involved. But I will do my best to review the game for ots own era, and only point out things by today's standards if they are so glaringly dated that it ruins immersion.\n\nIts a 3rd person JRPG-art style action RPG. You know, button mashing so your guy swings his (ridiculously long) sword around and stringing together combos, theres an inventory where you can get better gear, a monster compendium, map, stats you can improve. Standard action RPG fare.\n\nThe graphics are nice for the era, and are brightly colored. Of course they look a bit dated, but not terribly or distractingly so.\n\nSo far everyone, including random NPCs in town seems fully voice acted. Now, I am not a fan of full voice acting in RPGs. (Long story short - you can get a MUCH more in depth story hiring one programmer to write many lines of text for NPCs to "say" vs. having to hire people to voice different NPCs. Voice acting is expensive, and having full voice acting for everything, not just main cutscenes/characters, makes the story detail shallower. Case in point Morrowind VS Oblivion) But I digress...\n\nAnyway. By today's standards the voice acting is terrible. And even by the standards of the time (which I am trying to review this game by), the voice acting is laughable at best. Comparing the voice acting in this to say, Persona 3 (PS2 game) or even Baldur's Gate 2, there's just no contest. This sounds like it came out of the era when the first put badly voiced scenes in games circa 1992. Take the worst dubbed-anime voices and timing you can imagine. Yeah. It sounds like that.\n\nAgain, a case where it would have been better to only have a couple main characters voiced fully and save my ears. There are a few decent voices though. The main character Tal is listenable at least, as well as a couple other NPCs who's names escape me at the moment.\n\nThe script is ok. Not great. Its kinda...overblown and really seems translated from a different language. Not as bad as the voice acting though, just not great. I actually don't think it owuld have come off as bad if the voices were better.\n\nOne great thing is that its fully Xbox controller compatible (or Xinput for us Logitechers), as playing an action RPG like thos without a controller isnt advised. The controls are smooth on my Logitech, easy to understand and intuitive. Its fiun to go around bashing the crap out of enemies and learning new skills and making combos. THAT is where this game really shines\n\nOverall, its not terrible, but at least for what Ive seen of it (I will update it if it blows my mind through awesome plot development later on - but as of right now I doubt it), the nostalgia factor seems to weight heavily in on whether people like it or not. If you are a fan of this type of game and are way more into the combat and character levelling then by all means, grab it.","April 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Hopefully more Xbox games show up on Steam now, but anyway...\n\nGame has a simple but effective story. The combat is clunky due to being among the first 3D action RPGs of it's time but it introduced some interested mechanics to the gameplay element. You can switch between members on the fly and they change how you'll play the game. A melee character can combo their way to victory while a certain caster enters a first person style shooter mode. There isn't much outside of the core game however, you can do enchants but it's basic and you're free to determine your characters growth (for better and worse!) so it lets you meta-game to an extent.\n\nGraphically, the game runs and looks better than the CGI cutscenes, which is pretty funny. Luckily they aren't used as much as other turn based RPGs.\n\nJust be aware, apparently others are having problems getting the game to run. I haven't had such an issue but just be wary about it when you get the game, which at $5 USD I completely recommend.","March 10, 2014","true","20.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I highly recommend using an XBox controller for the PC if you have one.  The PC controls are not as good.  They work, but the controller works better.\n\nSecond, you HAVE to run this in Windows 95 compatibility mode or the game WILL NOT work.  You will get past the loading screen and everything will go black.  To set the compatibility mode you need to find the file in your steamapps folder, right click on the file, go into properties, and set the compatibility mode.  You have to do this for both Sudeki.exe and SudekiLauncher.exe.  Then you can run the executable.  The first time the game loads it will take a while to get past the "Loading..." screen, but once you save the game and re-load it it goes much, much faster.\n\nAll that said, the game is worth $5 in my opinion -- you can't even go to the movies for that these days.  Been a shortage of decent RPGs on the PC of late, and despite the game's age the graphics and sound are still servicable.  It's fun, and can offer a decent challenge.

I was fully aware that it cameout on pc and i still own both versions but it is nice to see it on steam.  I bought it again because the pc version i have isn't that great in playability since it has issues that were never patched in my version before the company sold the IP.\n\nIf anyone is curious with the story it is a little drab but gives lore to anthropomophic animals who you encounter throughout the game and the freedom to combat how you want is always a plus and if you need more action it allows for fps style shooting and magic casting aswell third person swordplay mechanics.\n\nThe game works perfectly fine so I have no clue what the hell anyone is talking about it not working on windows and it does not need compatiblity mode set maybe learn to use a computer and it's software before purchasing things.\n\nI will however mention this is an nvidia heavy game so those with ati cards will most likely have said mentioned problems. Allot of old xbox games and ports run on Nvidia software drivers so it might explain just a few things. As for fixes if you happen to have problems starting the game google the old fixes for the cd version and download their files to jumpstart the sucker they also contain patch fixes that address some problems if you encounter them that some seem to have with the game.\n\nUpdate - I have done much comparison between all three versions and can confirm this is a better HD version than the rest and includes improved mouth sync,graphic rendering,and dialogue that was missing with the exception of the FMV's that were left original and look really dated.","February 26, 2014","true","7.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The world is large enough to backtrack through and mess around with secret areas you could not previously but it definitely doesn't have the scope of an Elder Scrolls game - More puzzles and personality than walking.\n\nThe combat is fair - It takes a step back for every one that it takes forward and so therefor I can not judge it positively or negatively but at least you're not left-clicking your way through the game so Sudeki's combat is definitely a salvation for those with boxes filled to brim with broken  Diablo mice. The battles can often times grow challening and control schemes are sophisticated enough to offer a sense of interactivity but you're definitely not going to find the action you would in a game like Devil May Cry. Interestingly enough, ranged characters are forced into First Person perspective when selecting over to them.\n\nRight off the bat Sudeki does alot of things right that recent developers have forgotten all together like skipable cut scenes and skipable dialogue. Oh! But if you do like dialogue everyone you come by has something to say and it's all been vocally acted.\n\nIf there's only one complaint it's that this game was almost kid-safe but alas bloody & messy corpses litter the land.\nI have no preference to kid-safe games, of course, however when you're so close to clean it's a shame that they stepped off that trail a tad and clipped the game just short of being appropriate for eveyone.\n\nPrice Recommended: $20","March 13, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Also some of the cutscenes seem to be in terribly compressed video that would probably look hideous no matter what monitor you put it on.\n\nI should note that the Devs seem to be on top of thigs as far as trying to fix the existing bugs, but as of right now, they're there, and they're bad. Running the game in Windows 98/ME compatability mode  seems to remedy the most serious problems, but runnning the game as such may cause some fairly crippling load times.\n\nSudeki is an RPG, it's got a really silly naming sense using Japanese words (you've got a shopkeeper duck that's named Duck in Japanese... the game is not Japanese by the way), it has an ultra cliche storyline/cast of characters, and its got a battle system that consists of a rather clunky combo system for melee characters and a whole lot of circle strafing and/or kiting for ranged characters.\n\nHonestly, the game is pretty mediocre just in general, but I played it when it came out for xbox a decade ago (and I'm replaying it now on PC), and I still somehow enjoy my time with it. At 5 USD, despite the glaring problems, I think it's worth it (assuming that losing progress to glitches doesn't make you want to flip a table every time it happens; save points are fairly frequent).","February 26, 2014","true","22.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You have the sword guy(who is a tank), a dude witha gun (who shoots good), a nice pair of breasts  and a nice ♥♥♥ with a magic stick (she heals), and a nice pair of breasts and a nice ♥♥♥ with claws(she does... stuff(?)).\n\nThe aim of the game is to try and collect crystals to help your empire, or at least thats what they would have you believe. The real aim of the game is to find the best weapon for each person, gun guy automatically starts off with a rad gun that shoots through enemies with high damage, healing breasts gets her cool staff mid way through the game, it does the same as gun guys weapon(shoots through enemies, high damage, high crit), claw lady gets her good weapon early on when you visit her tribe of furries and retrieve their bad dragon order from a temple. sword guys stuff is all kinda okay, just use him to tank damage.\n\nThe game looks pretty rad, apart from all the cutscenes, which for some reason look kinda pixelated and rubbish. Sometimes you get some cutscenes that aren't the prescripted ones and the AI will walk in  dumb positions . Butt that doesn't matter too much.\n\nThe combat system is rather cool and needs skill and timing to get combos rather than mashing buttons, then again in combat all I ever did was "X, X, A, > A, A, X" which had a nice continous loop for juggling enemies.\n\nAll out this game is pretty good for something originally released on the ORIGINAL xbox.

You'll quickly get tired of doing the same combos to beat the same enemies again and again.And once you unlock skill strikes its the same thing each battle. Cast a shield magic so you get 70% less damage , then cast a revive spell once your party's health gets too low. Luckily you can switch between characters and you basically have the choice between hack and slash and a first person shooter. Good news is the FPS portion is well made. Bad news is it does not fit with the rest of the gameplay and feels sluggish and grindy all the same. I have always hated games that need to switch perspective to work properly. I get that porting it was a bummer , and they havent even managed to make the camera work on the Y axis in third person . Maybe that's the reason they left it as is , I dont know. Anyway , the FPS part works ok , and is somewhat fun , it just does not fit with the overall pacing of the game. And once you get to the tougher enemies that can heal themselves faster than your slow firing weapons can produce a shot it just becomes a game of "dodge and shoot for 15 minutes" .  What really saves it though is the "Lost Vikings" aspect. After about a couple of hours you will unlock all the characters and the game will either suck you in or push you away. The four playable characters each have a unique skill that is required in solving some of Sudeki's not-so hard puzzles.","February 17","false","16.8"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

While it is an XBox (original) port, the graphics have been updated to support higher resolutions. This is most obvious when watching the non-engine generated cut scenes. These really show their age.\n\nFor me, the game was okay. Four heroes are needed to collect crystals to make a "peace keeping" device. Turns out the peace keeping device is a energy sap to conjure a powerful demon. There is a shadow world and big epic boss fights.  It is linear: go here, go there, but you can't go to this other place. All the while you must stay on the path. And there are savepoints.\n\nYou do get to control all members of your party during combat. Combat also is more than button mashing. For the melee fighters, there is a combo system. Three hits in a row and you execute a combo. Ranged fighters are in first person view. For the most part the AI for the other party members is decent. I heard it is way better than the original XBox version.\n\nThere is a skill system. Each of the party members have both defensive and offensive skills. I did find that they seemed very unbalanced. And then there are the skill strikes. Bestowed upon the characters by the Gods themselves these are extremely powerful attacks that you must defeat enemies in order to charge the skill strike meter.\n\nI did have some crashes near the end. Also, the arena fights of the boss monsters sometimes left crazy camera angles and not much time to correct them. This was distracting more than anything, but getting walloped due to poor camera angle plain sucks. I also didn't care for the fan service. The female characters, as is seen in much fantasy, barely had any armor on.\n\nNot a bad game, but not necessarily one that I can recommend.","March 21, 2015","false","22.3"," 16 of 38 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","16","38","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/recommended/233350/","jbobw","Bob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jbobw/","247 products in account","I almost abandoned this game shortly after starting it but I persevered through most of the game and now think it would have been better if I had given up right at the start. The main problem with the game is the combat. You start off as a melee fighter and the combat mostly relies on using combos. These require slowly pressing different combinations of the mouse buttons which feels unnatural as you expect the combat to be fast paced, they are easily interrupted too. After a while you unlock a ranged character which has a standard FPS style in combat and is quite fun to begin with. As the game progresses the fights get more drawn out and tedious, you end up just running round avoiding enemies, hitting them to remove tiny amounts of health until you finally wear them down. The game also keeps splitting up the party with most the boss fights being one on one, so once you find the character who suits you best you will still be forced to use the ones you hate.\n\nAnother thing that aggravated me was the amount of retracing your steps you have to do if you want to complete the side missions. For example in the first village you arrive at the villagers talk about a ship wreck and it must have been the Amazon delivery ship because half the village was expecting something on the ship. So this seemed like an easy bunch of side missions, just head down to the beach collect all the flotsam and return. However it doesn't let you collect all the items at once you have to go back and forth to the beach 3 times and of course all the enemies respawn. There is a fast travel system but that is only unlocked so late into the game I had already lost all interest in doing anything that might prolong the game.\n\nThe bit that finally got me to give up on the game was near the end you have to escort a character to safety and I had saved my game when this NPC had low health without realising that I could not use any of the many healing potions I had on her This meant that no matter what I did she immediately got killed in the next section of combat and I really couldn't be bothered to go back and try again from my last save point so I just looked up the ending on youTube.\n\nOther minor annoyances were as follows. The camera controls, moving the mouse up and down does not rotate the camera up and down as you would expect, this is really disconcerting at the start but I got used to it. The voice acting is terrible, it is like they thought it would give the characters more life if they had a wide range of voices but they just ended up with a bunch of terrible stereotype accents. There is no mouse cursor in the menus, this creates the weird control scheme of being able to select items with a mouse click but having to use the keyboard to navigate the menu. The pre-rendered videos are terrible quality, much worse than the gameplay.\n\nCredit where credit is due apart from the lack of cursor in the menus the PC port is actually decent. The visuals were pretty good, a little dated but still good. The story was entertaining too but not enough to make the game worth playing in my opinion.","December 19, 2015","false","19.7"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

One of them being that the party you assemble is ultimately pointless because every single boss fight is single player. By which I mean that every serious boss fight picks one of the members from your team to fight alone which completely ruins the point in leveling your entire party. Another being the companion interaction. The dialogue is cheesy and predictable and as the game tries to create a magic vs science conflict, this fails hard as the arguments from both sides quickly become tedious and you find yourself not caring for either one. At all.

This is where the game really shines, I really enjoyed the diverse and creative map design that this game features. The character design was also very nice, featuring unique and well crafted characters.\n\nThe voice acting was a bonus for sure, but the dialogue overall did not feel at all natural, as if the dialogue was there only to quickly give you information relevant to the the story, delivering it in a way that felt forced.  It had no enjoyable feel to it. Although this did not affect the story in a large way, the player must 'translate' what came out of the dialogue and piece together the story which makes almost no sense at all until mid-game.\n\nI'm not sure if I was missing something, but the battles were not fun at all. There are areas in the world that spawn enemies, locking you in the battlefield until all the enemies are defeated. This was frustrating because there is no opportunity to escape from a battle, there is no way around battle zones and you must replay the battle even when passing through a battle zone you have previously defeated. The battle system itself was not bad, but battles seemed to take a very long time, especially once enemies started regaining health. As the game progressed, the battles got only slightly more difficult, while the length got unbearably long as you deal minuscule amounts of damage.\n\nThe keyboard controls were terrible, making movement and battle very difficult. It is much, much better with a controller.\n\nOverall, even for the $6 this game costs, I cannot recommend it.\n\n\n\n\n","October 25, 2015","false","11.2"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

More than enough for a solid first impression.\n\nWhat you have here is something as pointless as a skill-based combat RPG with no lock-on feature, sluggish, awkward controls, a protagonist who leaves huge openings in between his attacks and a dodge move that doesn't follow the camera direction. Top top the whole thing off, the game asks you to defeat large groups of enemies, rather than maneuvering around a few at a time. And if you fail, there is no guarantee the game will even let you return to town to buy healing potions so you can at least spam your way through the nonsense. That's playing with a controller, while the forums say K + M is even worse.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that you haven't heard of this game before. There are indications a solid game is buried beneath the godawful control scheme somewhere, but I couldn't be bothered to dig it up.

Great! the battle system? Great! So, what's wrong with this game? the Balance!\nnormally in a RPG the enemies are balanced out with your level or close to the level your at! not this game!\nOh No! the incounters are Pre-Programmed into rooms so you re-enter into one because you took a wrong step? you fight them again! and they get harder every time regardless or not you leveled up and they Overstay their welcome!\n3.Boss Fights:\nOk, this gets irritating.\nNormally in a RPG when you get ready to fight a big boss you overgrind or overpower yourself to fight the big baddie\nHere! you fight them One on One!, Mono-a-Mono, Hard? sometimes but still managable\n4.\nThe Dungeons:\nBy far the most annoying peice of Dog-Dung ever\nthey are beautiful and big but ANNOYING AS ALL HELL\nlater on the game it gets ridiculous later on,\nand there is no way to leave other than litterally walking out the front door\nso, if your low on Items,HP?

The plot is rather simple, but still entertaining enough to make you enjoy the game while relaxing your mind at the same time. EN voice acting is a bit silly and combat mechanics are somewhat weird at times, but this does neither affect the general impression, nor does it make you frustrated - at least not in my case.\n\nIf you feel like playing something easy on the eye, ear and mind, then Sudeki may be just the thing for you.\n\nPS.

It was as corny as hell, but it had its charms-none of which had anything at all to do with Buki's outfits...... >_>\n\nIf you like your fantasy RPG's to be fanciful and colourful, Sudeki's got plenty of it. And with full HD support at 60 fps, there are few pre-DLC games of its type that can stand with it on steam. You've got unique gameplay elements, mixing hack n slash, and first person shooting with your RPG-all in real time!\n\n...that being said, it's a 10 year old game. And it shows. Though the artstyle holds the graphics up well, you can see its age through all those blurry textures. It's nothing a mod couldn't fix, but given that this is such a niche title, it's unlikely anyone would take an interest in it.\n\nAnd while the gameplay as a whole works, its individual elements fall short on their own. Melee combat feels sluggish. The timing of combination attacks is too slow, and too often you'll end up taking a pounding while waiting for the next button prompt. And that goes without mentioning the lack of a free dodge system which we all take for granted in today's games. Meanwhile first person shooting is hampered by your movement speed. The gameplay only seems to show its strength when you've got a full party of 4. Anyone goes missing(this will happen often), and you'll start to see the holes, resulting in difficulty sparks abroad.\n\nFinally, we gotta talk about that voice acting. It's not Chaos wars bad, but jesus christ guys. Let's look at our protagonists here. Tal sounds like he's trying too hard at being generic, Elco sounds like every European guy ever, Buki sounds much older than she looks, and then there's Ailish........ No words man. No words.\n\nDo I recommend it? Only to existing owners who appreciate its charm, and want that cheap trip down nostalgia lane.","February 5, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Armour and weapon upgrades, leveling up, increasing stats, using special abilities. There are side quests in the game but they aren’t anything more than fetch quests which often result in mediocre rewards. The rest of the game, although it technically takes place in an open world, is mostly linear in terms of what you need to do next. Combat can be fun, however it can also be annoying sometimes when you try to pull off a combo, to find that your character was facing just to the side of the enemy and you start swinging at the air. The game also has full controller support and it works great.\n\nStory: 7/10\nFor the first 70% of the game there is little to no story development. Then near the end the story comes together and it’s actually not that bad. Overall not that much happens in Sudeki story-wise, so if you’re only looking for a deep plot, you’ll need to find it somewhere else.\n\nGraphics: 7/10\nGiven that this game was originally released on Xbox, the graphics are decent, and a noticeable effort was made to make the game look nice in HD. Although you probably won’t need a powerful PC to run this game, you still have a fair amount of graphics options to choose from.\n\nAudio: 6/10\nEvery character has a heavy accent (from a different region of the world). The music is nothing special.\n","August 22, 2015","true","16.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxczer/recommended/233350/","foxczer","Han","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxczer/","68 products in account","Definitely a nice game. Decent story and top tier visuals for it's time. You see MMOs with worse visuals than this in current modern day so these haven't aged THAT much. The style is semi cartoonish as well so there's no real need to go so intricate with graphics anyway. For those who have played this on XBox and are afraid of the ultra long load times this game had in that console, I'm glad to say those days are gone. The game has near no loading now. Also this game now has HD visuals so everything just looks prettier than you remembered. As sounds and voice go, the acting is average. Does the job but some characters sound less lively than others. My only gripe is that some cut scenes remained in low resolution. Mainly the very first intro to the game world, which would make players think the game is not HD. They used the in game engine to render them but they are still FMVs. An upgrade to these could have been nice, if possible. But it's minor in the end as many cut scenes are made non FMV.\n\nAs for gameplay. This game is an action RPG with some first person shooter elements. See, you play (eventually) as four characters. Two use melee weapons, one uses staves that can shoot magic and the last one uses magic infused guns. In combat, you switch through these characters at will, switching from third to first person depending on the character. Your spells are done in bullet time, as the game slows down to almost a full stop. Your enemies are fast and relentless so you need to strategize with all four characters if you want to survive. Combat itself is medium paced for melee users. Reminds me a bit of Phantasy Star Online and it's three attack combos for melee characters. First person is pretty much as you'd expect. You aim and shoot and that feels good and evenly paced.\n\nThe world is rather big for it's time and you have to run in the early levels to places that are rather far, yet there's no real loading times between most doors so the experience feels very open world. There's stuff laying about the world for you to check and interact with, and places with hidden treasure or screenshot worthy vistas.

Armour and weapon upgrades, leveling up, increasing stats, using special abilities. There are side quests in the game but they aren’t anything more than fetch quests which often result in mediocre rewards. The rest of the game, although it technically takes place in an open world, is mostly linear in terms of what you need to do next. Combat can be fun, however it can also be annoying sometimes when you try to pull off a combo, to find that your character was facing just to the side of the enemy and you start swinging at the air.
