"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/245390/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a fascinating piece of work. It's one of those games, much like Scratches, that works wonders with atmosphere, but not so much when it comes to the actual gameplay. Although where Scratches had a really tense, frightening atmosphere, No Mouth is more mysterious and depressing. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream works more with fridge horror, I feel. Yeah, it's creepy, but it's only truly scary if you sit back and think about it. And you will, because it's a tale that provokes thought.\n\nI Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream was originally a famous short story by one Mr. Harlan Ellison. If you get the chance, I recommend giving it a read, as there's a reason it's so famous. Actually, that's a lie. I don't recommend reading it. I really recommend listening to it. The I Have No Mouth audiobook, read by Harlan Ellison himself, is truly a treasure of audio. Ellison is hammy and over-the-top, but man does he sell it. The man gets completely into his story, and it benefits immensely from it.\n\nIf you've done the above, then I think you'll be more than pleased to hear that Ellison also plays AM, the maniacally hate-filled, torturous supercomputer who serves as your antagonist and tormenter for the duration of this game. He's every bit as hammy and over-the-top, and it's hard not to hang on his every word. The other voices in the game vary in quality, but you won't really notice the dips as you'll be too focused on the unfolding storylines, and also on WHAT DO I DO\n\nSo let's start with the story. You play five different characters, who comprise the entire remaining human population of Earth. AM, a colossal supercomputer which resides beneath the crust of the Earth, more or less got frustrated with his lot in life and unleashed the world's supply of nukes at... well, the world. But it kept five human beings alive to be his playthings for the remainder of eternity. For over a hundred years, these five humans have been subjected to ungodly torments, and now AM would like to play a little game.\n\nEach character is thrown into a scenario built especially for them, expected to be horrible and miserable for AM's amusement. The true goal before you is to fail AM, and prove yourself above his petty games. It is in these scenarios that you will learn about each character, their faults, their history, and a little bit about AM himself and what's going on behind the scenes and beyond your view.\n\nThis obviously differs from the original story, as these scenarios never existed. They were created (with major input from Ellison) especially for this game in order to give more backstory on the characters. Things change. The story as a whole changes. But it's still very much I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream.\n\nLet's talk about the gameplay.\n\nIt could be better.\n\nIHNM is presented in a classic SCUMM format. You have a list of verbs and an inventory at the bottom of the screen, both of which can be used to interact with the world around you. You will talk to characters, solve puzzles, find objects. All the familiar trappings of a good point-and-click adventure. So far, so good. The first major hitch is that eternal adventure game hellspawn, the unrelated event. You know what I'm talking about. When you do a thing, which triggers an unrelated thing to happen somewhere else which you have no way of knowing about and no reason to think might have happened. So many point-and-click adventures have fallen prey to this design flaw (Myst IV and Hector 3 among them, just thinking off the top of my head, here), and I wish it would stop.\n\nI had one point in the first scenario I picked where I didn't know what to do. I looked up a guide, and it didn't help. I thought maybe my game was glitched, as I had done everything the guide had ordered. And then I saw it. A very subtle thing. A line in the guide telling me to exhaust a certain character's dialogue. All I had skipped (for reasons that we'll get to in a moment) was an entirely unnecessary rude line that doesn't actually help anything. But lo and behold, when burning off that one useless line of dialogue caused an unrelated character to appear in a different location, freeing progression from the devs' icy cold grip.\n\nThere are some other annoying bits, here and there. Some items and interactables that aren't exactly obvious on the screen. Two scenarios allow you to progress past important items or before doing mandatory bits. It's problematic, and very confusing when it happens. Luckily, it's possible to die after this moment in one of the scenarios, bringing you back to the character select where you can choose to try again. For the other one... well, just keep multiple saves, is all.\n\nIn addition to simply making through each scenario, every character has a personal spiritual meter. The better the spirits they're in, the lighter the background behind their portrait in the lower-left becomes. Practice good morals and make progress to lighten it. Screw up, be corrupt or evil, or just cause your character to freak out to darken it. If the meter turns white as the scenario draws to a close, you've perfected that scenario. This is not always easy to do. I only managed it in two scenarios.\n\nThey say you need to get a white meter with each character in order to see the best ending, and that's going to require either a guide or multiple playthroughs. I wonder, though. I'm pretty positive I did in fact get the best ending, despite not having all whites. I think it's probably possible as long as each character has almost a white meter, or a couple characters have white meters and everyone else is close? Or something? Though don't quote me on that, I really don't know, and there's a surprising lack of entirely helpful documentation on this subject.\n\nAnyways, my advice is to not worry about it. Do your best and get an ending, whatever that ending may be. Give the finale a few tries, though, because you'll probably screw it up a couple times.\n\nAnyways, point is, the game looks great and sounds great, and the story will draw you all sorts of in. Just be aware that you may need to consult the Internet at times, and be sure to rotate your saves. Or do what I did and just make each save a new one, because this game seems to have infinite slots. Which is a nice feature.\n\nFor all its faults, I still enjoyed the majority of my time with I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. And if you're a fan of the original story, or games which not only don't shy away from adult themes, but walk straight through a minefield of adult themes and take it all in stride with a sly grin upon their lips, then I think you'll enjoy it too.","October 12, 2014","true","8.9"," 285 of 292 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","285","292","5","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/245390/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2594 products in account","I have no mouth, and I must scream is a classic adventure game first released back in 1996. Since its release, it's acquired a large cult following, hailing it for its dark and very mature storyline. It's based on a short story by Harlan Ellison, released in 1967.\n\nStory\nThe game takes place 109 after the destruction of mankind. A computer calling itself AM, which was originally created to wage war with the other super powers. Wars had become so complex that humans could not oversee them, which resulted the three super powers (USA, Russia & China) creating their own super computers, which ended up wiping out humanity.\nAM hates humans. It hates humans for what they've done. Hate drives it to torture 5 specific humans, the last living humans on earth, making them immortal, so that it can torture them forever. These 5 characters are the characters that you play as.\nEach character gets its own short (<1h) storyline, where you have to guide them through their own personal hell, based on what AM view as the most just punishment for their past deeds.\n\nGameplay\nThe game plays like a typical mid 90's point & click adventure game. You have an inventory, and most of the puzzles are about figuring out which item goes where. Many sections have multiple solutions, and depending on which solution you find, you'll get a different final ending ("kinder" solutions generally result in better endings). Actually solving the puzzles needed to progress the story is quite easy, far easier than the puzzles of most contemporary adventure games, but figuring out how to get the good ending often feels like you're trying to read the puzzle designers mind. It feels like this was made with replay value in mind, as the game is quite short, but it ends up being rather frustrating, as you can end up getting a bad ending simply because you walked through a door at the wrong time, without the game properly warning you about it.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nThe graphics is quite good for the era. While the animation quality might not be up to par with the greatest games of its genre, the scenes are very atmospheric and all feel like they're made to convey a certain mood.\nThe voice acting is also good, but not outstanding. Compared to its contemporary counterparts, it would be considered really good, but voice acting tends to be a bit better these days. Still, all the voices fit, and the voice actors do a good job at conveying how their characters feel when they speak.\n\nFinal thoughts\nI have no mouth, and I must scream is a game that I feel has a well deserved good reputation. While it might be a bit too short, and trying to figure out what the developers were thinking when you try to solve the puzzles if you want a good ending is not always fun, but the story is very well told. When I say that the story is "Mature", I don't mean mature as in there being a lot of gore & nudity in the game, but rather it's a story dealing with some very dark subjects in a mature way, and this helps lift the game above the masses. It might not be a perfect game, but for anyone who enjoy point & click adventure games aimed at a more adult audience, it's a must play.","November 8, 2015","true","4.5"," 107 of 116 people (92%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","92","107","116","6","0"

For example, a number of progression events will only occur after you say or do things that are completely unrelated to the event.\n\nUnlike most adventure games of its time, there are multiple solutions to many puzzles...but usually only one "good" way. You'll have great difficulty getting the best ending (and yes, there are multiple endings) without a walkthrough.

Starring ... HARLAN ELLISON\nFor those unaware, this P&C Adventure game is based on the dystopian post-apocalyptic sci-fi short story of the same name, written by Harlan Ellison in 1967. Nearly 30 years later, a team of game devs decide to make the game, and they contact Ellison for permission to make the game, and not only do they get permission, they *get him to voice the villain* (who is, in some sense, the story's chief character). "AM" wouldn't be half as awesome without Ellison. He was about 60 at the time and about 80 now ... yes, still alive ... and it'd be great if Steam players newly discovering the game wrote him fanmail about how the game inspired them to read his work, etcetc... ^_^\n\n2. Aged Gracefully\nFor a 1995 PC game, the game's graphics are decent, the audio is of the same variety as (but in many ways superior to) the first two Elder Scrolls games, and the engine is surprisingly stable. Based on other reviews I've read, your mileage may vary, but I had exactly zero crashes in a multi-faceted playthrough (testing different fail-states and endings, etc). As a huge Adventure buff, I can assure you that there are dozens, perhaps hundreds of games released in the past two decades that won't be as valuable 20 years down the road as this one turned out to be.\n\n3. Not just full VA ... *good* VA\nI'll have to take exception to Dr. Nimdok, whose slow, aged German accent sometimes misses the mark, especially as to which words or syllables to stress. Other than that, the character VA in this game is leaps and bounds beyond its 1995 peers. I suspect this is because the actors were getting to read lines either directly from, or inspired by, the original short story, which is quite well-written. So good.\n\n4. "Dude, that's not PC!"\nReal characters have flaws. Real characters don't give a crap about whether they're being politically correct or not, especially when they're on their own and have survived 100+ years of torture by a mad machine. I'm not praising this as though it's something to be cherished: rather, I'm saying that the surly nature of Benny, the rugged trucker-ness of Gor, and pretty much the entire Nimrok scenario make for a pretty provocative game. I suppose the open talk about Ellen's plight would also apply.\n\n5. Fail-States exist, but they don't over-punish\nBecause this game is paced out *just right,* if you accidently off your character and lose progress, it's not a huge deal. The five scenarios are each short enough that you'll a) remember the puzzles well enough to quickly recover progress if needed or b) you'll have saved like 2 minutes beforehand and then it *really* doesn't matter. That said, there are ways for characters to die -- some more easily than others. And in the end scenario, it gets really tricky...\n\n6. Endings galore\nThere are, in fact, five bad endings and one good ending. It's in the end scenario that the game takes the strongest departure from the short story: the latter offers a fight scene between two of the characters that, due to the way the game is structured, simply wasn't going to happen. However, the five bad endings of the game combined make up, in essence, what Harlan Ellison originally wrote. Each character will deliver those famous words after describing in wretched detail what AM has done to them for the rest of eternity after their failed assassination attempt. BUT, should you get the "true" ending (not at all in Ellison's story, but apparently Ellison-approved since he voiced his dialogue for this ending), there's something horribly fascinating waiting at the end, including some excellent philosophy that fits very much with this and Ellison's other tales.\n\n7. Click what where with what, oh it's too much! -- No it's not.\nOne thing I've found in the Adventure revival of the past 5 years is an over-abundance of items in my inventory. It gets to be a bit *too* much. In IHNM, however, the standard view of the inventory shows only 8 slots. This will actually expand (and has to in at least one scenario). Yet, in another scenario, the number of items only goes as high as three. As for interaction options, you have the basic set: Walk to, Talk to, Look, Use, Take. Give, Push, and my favorite, Swallow. And that's it. That's all you need to get around, and with the narration and a little bit of clever thinking, you'll find many of the puzzles solve themselves. That said...\n\n8. Walkthrough-friendly\nShould you need to turn to a walkthrough (GameFAQs has three at present), it's pretty easy to figure out where to look. Most people won't need it until they reach the end, and if they find themselves exasperated (especially by which character order to use) then a walkthrough can spell it out. Quickly, and painlessly, without the pain of a thousand qualifications ("if you've done this, don't do that" etc). The complexity of this game is in its narrative. The mechanics and puzzle-solving are less dense, though they can still be tricky even on that surface layer.\n\n9. Did I mention the length?\nThis game is of the perfect length for most 21st-century gamers. The devs were ahead of their time in this regard. Its peers were often packing in filler content to brag about how many hours the player could get out of it. And then, on the other hand, there are a handful of P&C Adventures so pathetically short that they're hardly worth calling a game. This one fits just right: 2 hours with a walkthrough, 5-8 without (that range I'd give based on players' range of problem-solving capabilities and/or desire to skip voice acting with right-click spam).\n\n10. We vote with our dollars\nIf the other nine points have convinced you that this game might actually be *good,* let me remind you here at the end: Steam notices what kinds of games we buy. How much of any given title is purchased will mean something to them. Financially it also means something to the rights-holders of this game. And while it could crash and burn miserably, I'd not be opposed to a huge overhaul / HD remake of this very game -- sometimes the risk pays off. Or, perhaps, it would inspire other developers to do decent P&C adventures with weighty/heady sci-fi short stories from other great authors. This game proved it could be done, and done well.","December 28, 2014","true","8.0"," 65 of 66 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","65","66","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/245390/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 6 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","IHNM&IMS is one of the more interesting point and click adventure games. It is an adaptation of a Harlan Ellison short story... kind of. It doesn't follow the plot of the original story but moreso elaborates on it's characters and the setting.\n\nThe premise of the game features a super computer called A.M. that has destroyed all of humanity. The characters of the game are the last remaining human beings who have been tortured for 109 years. Each character has a unique backstory and a notable fatal flaw. And they each have a different scenario A.M. puts them through. A.M. was also voiced by Harlan Ellison which is an interesting bit of trivia.\n\nWhat's notable about the game is how it has numerous multiple endings for each character and the actual "end" of the game based on how you acted throughout. Harlan Ellison went on record as stating the game was designed in such a way so that you could not exactly "win" but you would have "A variety of moral and ethical ways to lose". It's a very interesting game in this regard and doubly so since the original writer was so involved in it's production.

While I consider “The Longest Journey” the paramount of an adventure experience and believe that everyone should at least try this game, in case of IHNMaIMS is more complicated since, clearly, it is not a game everyone can enjoy.\n\nFirst off all, IHNMaIMS is kind of The Elder Scrolls of adventure gaming, and for more than one reason. Firstly, hardy any point and click adventure gives player such freedom of choices. Secondly, much less on a positive note, this is possibly the greatest bugfest in the history of adventure gaming. When deciding to play this game one has to be prepared to face game breaking bugs that will inspire either restarting one’s adventure or a ragequit. Still, while IHNMaIMS forums are choke-full of bug reports ,  I was lucky enough to finish at least three different versions of this game without any problems.\n\nSecondly, people who prefer solid mechanics and comfortable gameplay may (and probably will) completely disdain this game. In IHNMaIMS everything seems to be secondary to narration. If you prefer story over anything else, then that is not an issue, but if you want to play comfortably know this: this game has a nasty habit of playing with the gamer. Not to spoil too much, it often may look like you have to do something bad to another character (kill is such a nasty word…) or a group of characters to gain a particular item or simply progress a story. And when you finish that chapter you discover that said item was completely useless. On the other hand, the character’s alignment / sanity is of great importance in this game, and it is affected all the time, exactly by this kind of choices.\n\nThirdly, it needs to be said that to fully appreciate this game, some basic knowledge of Freudian psychology is needed. Especially the ego, superego and id and the dream symbolism may come in handy.\n\nSo, what does this game give in return ? Probably the most emotionally engaging experience in the history of adventure gaming. The world (or worlds) within this game is rich and congruent, storylines are brilliant and characters are captivating ( The game goes to great lengths to make one feel compassionate even for a sadistic scientist of a totalitarian regime). Also the way the puzzles fit into the storyline is truly brilliant. For example (not much of a spoiler, since that’s the very beginning of this particular chapter), the first day of the Benny’s storyline. Benny’s body has been completely mutilated during the years of merciless torture, his bones have been shattered and forced to grow together in a bad way, his vocal cords have been torn out and he is generally a mess. Consequently, first he has to learn  how to eat, walk up the stairs and how to communicate with others.\n\nFinally, for the game that’s nearly 20 years old, the graphics are still pretty impressive. The backgrounds are dark, moody and full of detail. Still, It should be appreciated how authors made almost every important item clearly visible.To conclude, let me just suggest running this game on ScummVM, a free tool that enables many graphic and sound options as well as some bugfixes – which in this particular game helps a lot.\n\nWersja Polska\n\nPisanie o I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (dalej IHNMaIMS) przychodzi mi z trudem ze względu na fakt że jest to jedna z tych gier które zdefiniowały moje podejście do przygodówek. Inaczej jednak, niż w przypadku „Najdłuższej Podróży”, która niezmiennie jest moim „numerem jeden” w świecie point and clicków, nie mogę IHNMaIMS polecić każdemu.\n\nPo pierwsze, można powiedzieć  że ta gra jest swoistym „Elder Scrollem”  przygodówek, i to z więcej niż jednego powodu. Podobnie jak seria Bethesdy daje wolność wyboru niespotykaną u innych przedstawicieli danego gatunku. I podobnie jak „Scrollsy” jest aż po same brzegi napakowana bugami wszelkiej maści i kalibru. Odpalając IHNMaIMS trzeba być przygotowanym na błędy które mogą uniemożliwić jej ukończenie, zmusić do restartu całej historii, albo spowodować ragequit. Inna sprawa, że ukończyłem co najmniej trzy różne wersje tej gry, nie natrafiając na żadne poważniejsze bugi, więc da się też „zaliczyć” ją bezproblemowo.\n\nPo drugie, ludzie ceniący sobie solidną mechanikę ułatwiającą rozgrywkę na każdym kroku prawdopodobnie znienawidzą tą grę. Jakie problemy można mieć z mechaniką w point and clicku? W IHNMaIMS wszystko jest drugoplanowe względem opowiadanej historii.  Osoboy ceniącym sobie w grach przede wszystkim angażującą narrację nie będą miały z tym problemów, niemniej ta gra potrafi momentami być bardzo złośliwa. Zamierzenie. Żeby uniknąć spoilerów wspomnę tylko że nieraz może wydawać się że jedynym sposobem zdobycia jakiegoś przedmiotu czy popchnięcia historii na przód jest wyrządzenie mniejszego bądź większego zła któremuś z bohaterów pobocznych. Kiedy już gracz zdobędzie dany przedmiot, okazuje się że nie jest on do niczego przydatny, podczas gdy poczytalność bohatera –którą tracimy bądź zyskujemy, zależnie od dokonywanych decyzji – odgrywa kluczową rolę w opowiadanej historii.\n\nPo trzecie, żeby w pełni docenić IHNMaIMS, przydaje się podstawowa znajomość psychologii Freudowskiej – ego, super ego, id, symbolika snów. Bez tego niektóre fragmenty gry mogą wydać się niezrozumiałe.\n\nA co ta gra może dać w zamian? Prawdopodobnie najbardziej wciągający horror science-fiction w historii gier przygodowych. Świat (czy raczej światy) przedstawiony tutaj jest bogaty, mroczny i fascynujący, historia ciekawa, a postacie wielopoziomowe i wzbudzające sympatię (nawet sadystyczny doktor z obozu zagłady – bo i kimś takim przyjdzie nam grać) . Jeżeli zaś chodzi o zagadki które stawiane są przez graczem, uważam je za szczytowe osiągnięcie jeżeli chodzi o łączenie narracji z mechaniką rozgrywki. Przykładem niech będzie początek historii Bennego (nie jest to wielki spoiler – pierwsze 5 minut rozdziału).  Benny jest uroczą postacią – jego kości zostały połamane i zrosły się w paskudny sposób, struny głosowe zostały wyrwane z jego gardła, twarz ma pociętą w drobną kratkę – ogólnie Benny nie jest okazem zdrowia. Oczywiście ma to wpływ na zadania przed jakimi staje  – na początku musimy nauczyć go jak komunikować się bez używania głosu, jeść (!) i wchodzić po schodach (!!).\n\nMógłbym o tej grze napisać wiele więcej, ale kończy mi się miejsce więc słowo o oprawie: po prawie 20 latach grafika ciągle robi wrażenie. Tła są klimatyczne, pełne szczegółów i wspaniale kształtują mroczny obraz gry, budowany również przez klimatyczną muzykę. Warto wspomnieć że autorzy dokonali niemal cudu sprawiając że na tych pełnych detali tłach prawie każdy istotny dla fabuły przedmiot jest widoczny. Na koniec wspomnę jeszcze tylko że najlepiej uruchomić tą grę przez ScummVM, darmowe narzędzie udostępniające w starych przygodówkach wiele opcji graficznych, dźwiękowych i naprawiających wiele błędów – co w przypadku IHNMaIMS ma niebagatelne znaczenie.","October 4, 2014","true","0.5"," 27 of 29 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","27","29","0","0"

I have just rushed to the end of this game, and now I'll be rushing a review. I'll be spending the next few hours bumrushing plot summaries or looking at additional content, endings, and at some point I'd like to read the original short story pdf included in the game files. Okay this is stressful because I feel there's a lot to talk about. Holy ♥♥♥♥. More recently, I've become a big fan of point-and-click games and I've never touched anything like this. This game is GRIM, I could go on and on about how I've never encountered anything like this in any capacity (this includes all media, I'm willing to say that now). The story is insane, comprehensive, believable, well-researched, and covers a lot of controversial material. This game doesn't ♥♥♥♥ around. Here's where it's going to get a little spoiler-heavy. In this game, there is a ♥♥♥♥ scene, and it is story-serving. I know the area is gray but I would be shocked to learn if anyone was under the impression that such a scene was included to pander to deviant males or something along those lines (I'm talking now about criticism for Hotline Miami). This is by far the most mature game I've ever played. The villain, a supercomputer named AM, is almost comically evil in that he tortures five people profoundly for 109 years, keeping them artificially alive. While we're on the subject of AM, I want to get this out of the way because it's still fresh in my mind: the final level is by far the best in terms of story and visuals, the entire thing comes full circle without any enormous monologue or contrived adlib about the relationship between man and machine. It will not pull that ♥♥♥♥. I LOVE that the Russian and Chinese counterparts of AM and AM himself appear physically as god figures. I am fascinated in all things "ultimate" especially those types of metaphors which appear in very immaculate or, at least not in this case, formless designs. Let the pacing of this review so far be a reflection of how the game has impacted my mind in the time to follow. I'm this far in the review and I'm sensing the package is wrapping up nicely. How much more can I say? Do you need me to address every theme in this game at once, to put into poor grammar the peace I am at? I wouldn't be able to do it justice. I can't review the game properly. I have no mouth and I must scream, so to speak. 10/10 game, VERY annoying programming errors set me back a few hours. The story managed to trounce these negatives, it's that good.

The story was great, the scenarios had a wide rage of challenge to them, and over all the different scenery was great. I do have a few criticisms of the game although...\n\nThe Save Game Glitch: When I was on my second scenario (I went Ellen then Gorrister) I kept one saved game because I didn't think I'd need another. The problem with that was I had to quit the game for a minute. When I went back to my saved game, Gorrister wasn't on screen. I could not advance through the story and I had to restart my game. The solution? Keep like a butt load of saved games on you I mean really save save save!!\n\nNimdok's Scenario: The story was fantastic but...it is EASY to advance through this scenario to the point of no return without specific items you will need. You have to do it a SPECIFIC way to advance in the story. The solution for this one is to read up on his story before hand or you definitely won't know what you're doing. I mean unless you are hardcore willing to go through the scenario a billion times I will reccomend you do this.\n\nEndgame Strobe: During the endgame portion (no spoilers) at points the screen will start to flicker, possibly due to the graphics. This is easily remedied by going to another screen.\n\nOtherwise the game is very playable, it's fun, and it's easy to get invested into the story.

Since we don't live in such a world, however, I'll have to tilt toward the red side of things, because the game's many good qualities are ultimately overshadowed by its infuriating design and failure to live up to its own aspirations of profundity.\n\nFirst the good, and that right off the bat:  I Have No Mouth...  has one of the best opening monologues I've ever seen in a game -- a joyously hateful screed delivered in blistering fashion by the game's antagonist, an insane supercomputer called AM. It's the year future-future-something-or-other, and AM, being a supercomputer in a video game, has (surprise!) taken over the world, killed off most of humanity, and spent the last 109 years keeping our five "heroes" hostage and subjecting them to all sorts of tortures in an underground lair. AM narrates this backstory with a chilling mix of glee over his own sadism, and bone-deep bitterness over the fact of his own miserable existence. Here's a YouTube clip of this cheerful setup -- dig it, you won't regret it.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace immediately drops from headlong to plodding, as the five flawed protagonists are split up and sent off on banal individual quests. (The player can freely choose the order in which to tackle them). AM tantalizes each of his victims with a promise of freedom, if only they can navigate their way through a personalized test of AM's making. The point of AM's game is, apparently, to explore the individual vices and psychology of his five playthings.  The protagonists are therefore forced to make choices that test their strength of character and, ultimately, determine whether the player achieves the "good," "middle," or "bad" ending of the game.\n\nThis is a terrific setup for an adventure game, but the execution here is botched for two main reasons. First, the choices facing the characters are so black-and-white that you almost have to  try  to fail the subquests. At one point, for example, you're offered the choice to rescue a small boy on a sacrificial altar, or... eat him. Decisions, decisions!\n\nSecond -- and this is more of a design flaw than a narrative one -- if you don't perform your tasks within a subquest in the exact (often arbitrary) order that the developers intended, certain necessary branches of the story won't open up even when you  know  what to do next. After pulling your hair out for a while, you'll look up an online guide and see that the reason your character won't perform an obvious solution to the challenge at hand is because you failed to talk to an unrelated character four screens away and three saved games ago. The upshot is that you're forced to replay the entire subquest in a slightly different manner in order to get the plot moving again. This is every bit as tedious as it sounds.\n\nBroadly speaking,  I Have No Mouth...  seems like it's aspiring to Say Something About Society, but I'm not quite sure what that could be, other than (perhaps) "human vice + technology = tragedy," or maybe "our ability to make moral choices is what makes us human." Both of which are undoubtedly true, but hardly original or even all that deep. So without interesting ideas or a smoothly-flowing narrative, we're left with a slow-paced and sometimes tedious game that fails to live up to the promise of its wonderful opening moments.\n\nI Have No Mouth...  has a lot of good qualities (e.g. its disturbing central premise, Harlan Ellison's scenery-chewing voiceover work for AM, or the occasional inspired horror sequence), but for the reasons described above I didn't have a particularly good time playing it, nor was I left with much to think about in terms of interesting themes.

The story to this game is immensely interesting yet bleak. Since this is a 90's point and click though, the controls are a bit hard to use and there is a bit of developer logic (a lot in a few campaigns, not as much in others) but otherwise no matter if you win or lose the story is captivating and the characters are surprisingly deep for what they are. Not to mention the soundtrack is kickass.\n\nIf you feel frustrated that you got the bad ending (because honestly, the good ending DOES require a lot of dumb logic) i'd like to say that in the original short story, there was no good ending. Good ending being hard to get is a common complaint, but I feel the good ending isn't really needed at all.\n\nOh, also; this is pretty much trigger warning the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysticTeaWolf/recommended/245390/","MysticTeaWolf","Maximillian Strauss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MysticTeaWolf/","807 products in account","I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is based on the novel of the same name by Harlan Ellison which I wasn't aware of until playing this game. I have since added the book to my Amazon wishlist to read in the near future.\n\nThe game is a horror-themed point and click adventure released in 1995 and has various elements that classify it as a weird type of horror game. The title alone should raise interest in almost everyone who hasn't played the game and since it is quite hard to find a physical copy of the PC or DOS versions of the game, Steam is the easiest method of acquiring it. For those thinking of purchasing a physical copy you will need a copy from around 1995 or an IBM compatible PC as stated in the game's specs. However, the Steam version is the DOS version of the game and runs through a software emulation called DOS Box which can be used to play other DOS games(such as System Shock). This means that the game ran seamlessly on my Windows 7 Professional 64-bit machine.\n\nThe game allows you to play as each of 5 players which I will briefly describe. Benny is a mutilated brute, Ellen is a professional engineer who has a hysteric phobia of the colour yellow, Nimdok is an old man with an amusingly voice-acted foreign accent who is conducting a sadistic experiment at  a Nazi concentration camp in 1945, Gorrister who is a suicidal loner haunted by what happened to his wife, and finally Ted who is a cynical paranoid. The basic story is centred around these 5 beings who have been held captive against their will for the past 109 years or so by a very creepy computer name AM (Applied Mastercomputer) who was implanted by nations into the centre of the earth. AM wants to play a game with each of the 5 and tests them in a way as to the decisions they make during their adventures.\n\nEach character has a unique adventure with some of them such as Nimdok's being considerably short. The adventures presented by each individual will present the player with puzzles and clues which they will have to figure out by using their brains or through a walkthrough. The game can be quite unforgiving based on the choices the player makes and will force them to restart the character's story. However, the save system implemented in the game allows you to overcome this by regularly saving and loading. The game's save icon represented by a floppy disc starts to spin when the player hasn't saved in a while which is a neat feature. The game exhibits the standard mechanics of a point and click adventure game with a range of options to choose from and being able to explore through just clicking either left or right mouse button. Using all the options you can concatenate sentences together which will command the character and depending on the context make them interact with the world.\n\nMy personal favourite of the 5 character's stories was Teds due to the setting of a creepy haunted castle and its relevant themes. Least favourite was Benny's story but this is just my personal opinion.\n\nThe game is not very short and can be finished in possibly 5 hours, even though I took 16 hours because I play games slowly and explore as well as replay things to see other alternatives. It is a very weird game that will give you the creeps. I must check out the book which I've heard is nearly similar to the game if not for a few differences regarding the characters.\n\nAlready, the game at its normal price (£3.29) is a giveaway, but wait for the Steam sales to get it even cheaper. Thoroughly recommend trying this game but it is not going to be for everyone.","January 12, 2014","true","16.0"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

As a young lad the demo of this bleak, creepy adventure game had haunted me, but never did I save enough allowance to buy the full game before it disappeared into the ether. Now, at last, I can revisit it and experience the horror for myself... and discover it's not all that horrifying, but it's still a fine adventure game.\n\nWell, the premise is horrifying at least. The mad supercomputer AM has obliterated humanity, preserving only five individuals to torture for more than a hundred years. Now AM wants to play a special game with them, one that could result in their freedom, if they can overcome their fears and regrets. Each of the characters has some dark secret that AM has used to torture them; one was a Nazi doctor, another had his wife committed, and so on. You chose which scenario to play through, and if you die (yes, you can die in this adventure game, but it's only a temporary setback) you get to choose again. The gameplay is what you'd expect of an adventure game, though my impression is that this one is lighter on the item collecting and combining and more on interacting with the scenery and other characters. It can be a bit of a pixel hunt at times, and some of the puzzles are a little obtuse owing to the nightmarish nature of the scenarios AM concocts.\n\nWhat really got me was the voice acting. I didn't even recall the game being voice acted when I was a child, and honestly the game is probably better served without it. The godlike supercomputer taunts his victims like a stuffy DOTA player ridiculing his team. The one woman of the group talks in some seriously dated 90s forced ebonics that gets pretty cringeworthy at times. The writing itself generally holds up, but there are occasional tonal shifts where a character tries to make a funny in the midst of confronting their horrors. Sadly, this one isn't quite as atmospheric and creepy as I had remembered, but it's a solid enough adventure game from what I've seen. And the world always needs more unique adventure games.","September 14, 2015","true","1.0"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/245390/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a point and click that was released on Halloween in 1996. The game is based off of the post-apocalyptic short story of the same name by Harlan Ellison, which was first published in 1967. It is classified as one of the top ten most reprinted stories in the English language, and it is highly acclaimed. It's also noteworthy that Harlan himself voices the antagonist in the game, a computer called AM.\n\nThe plot of the story takes place 109 years after the destruction of human civilization, which was caused by the escalation of the Cold War into a full blown world war. The three warring nations, Russia, China, and the United States, had all built super computers which were put in charge of running the war; as they were deemed more efficient at the task. The computers were referred to as AM, which originally stood for Allied Mastercomputer, then later Adaptive Manipulator, and finally Aggressive Menace. One of the computers eventually became self aware and absorbed the other two, and then carried out the mass genocide of humanity; save four men and one woman.\n\nThe final survivors of the human race, Gorrister, Benny, Nimdok, Ted and Ellen, are housed in a seemingly endless underground personal hell. The master computer, AM, harbors an immense hatred for all human kind, and has spent every available moment for the last 109 years torturing the poor souls that he 'spared' from the mass genocide. He not only has kept them from committing suicide, but he has made them nearly immortal over the years, thus allowing them to survive for such a long period of time.\n\nThroughout I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, it is your duty to get each of the five survivors to the end of their scenario without letting them die, commit suicide, or otherwise make a wrong decision that could end up ending their scenario early. If the character dies or commits suicide, the scenario ends and you must begin again; if they end up making a wrong decision, it will have an effect on the ending that you will receive. There are multitudes of endings available, although some of them are very similar; you have a chance for the best, worst, and bad endings.\n\nThe game has a disturbing, morose atmosphere that is carried by an overall darkened setting throughout each scenario. From the inside of a grungy airship, to a remote forest inhabited by a tribe that sacrifices its people to AM, to a Nazi war camp in 1945, each character has their own distinct setting, with many gruesome discoveries to be made. However, what makes the game truly disturbing is the thought of actually being kept alive and tortured for over 100 years, and the effect that it would have to have on the human psyche.  It would be a living hell, wherein you ultimately forget that there ever was anything else, questioning reality and if you had perhaps actually died and gone to hell.  Coupled with the haunting knowledge that we are, as a society, getting closer every year to creating such advanced technology, the idea behind I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream should be more spine-tingling now than it was 40 some years ago.\n\nWhile many people in the forums have stated that they've ran into bugs and glitches that have prevented them from finishing the game, I had no such issues during my four hours with the title. The most that happened for me was the background music stopping entirely, which was a shame since the musical score is incredible for its time period. I also somehow managed to unlock the debug screen during Nimdok's scenario... which was weird, but not game destroying.\n\nOverall, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is a solid horror point and click, which was ahead of its time in 1996. The atmosphere is dark, lonely, and grim. It does a great job of conveying the sense of dread and loneliness that each of the characters experience, and the idea of the main plot will really linger in the recesses of your mind for a while. Harlan Ellison even wrote most of the in-game dialogue, and coauthored this expanded storyline. However, I do not find this title better than other horror point and clicks of the same era, namely Sanitarium. If you have a choice of only one or the other, I would go with the latter. For the true horror fan though, I still recommend this title for its capability to truly haunt the human mind.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","April 25","true","4.1"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

Ellison's direct involvement in the game definitely shows and his voice as AM, the machine God, is brilliant.\n\nThe storytelling in the game creates a very immersive experience, drawing you into each character's mind and torment.  You learn the deepest secrets and darkest fears, even the outrageous desires of these character's and the realistic reactions really put you in the character's shoes.\n\nThe premise of the game alone brings intrigue but the unfolding of this story in such a mysterious way is really what drew me in, I wanted to learn as much as I could about the post-apocalyptic world that was presented to me.  The idea of a super AI turning itself into a type of God is interesting indeed.\n\n\nThe story is so excellently encapsulated, the imagery is macabre and barren, and it's all brought together here marvellously.  Nothing is left out, in fact, in the gaming format you have an opportunity to explore beyond the main narrative.\n\nPoint and click at its finest.\n\nI can also say, having played this back in the 90s, that this Steam version works really well and I believe the game has aged  nicely.","January 1, 2015","true","3.1"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

The characters are too watered down (especially Ellen and Ted, no way they have been tortured for 109 years) and the ending feels a bit too light and disjointed, trading Harlan's signature hopelessness for more trivial heroic tropes. While it's understandble and probably makes a game more "playable" with a clear goal of coping with your past mistakes in sight, the ones who are familiar with the source material might feel a little dissapointed. Not to say that you won't find enough disturbing stuff to entertain you, especially compared to the more light-hearted examples that this genre usually offered back then. The char stories' length is also balanced pretty poorly, so you should really hope that Gorrister will be your favorite plaything.\n\nGameplay-wise IHNMAIMS is a solid point-and-click adventure that runs on SAGA (which is really not all that different from the familiar SCUMM interface, though in this case I do wonder whether they seriously needed that separate "push" button) with a mix of logical reasoning, occasionally irritating re-checking of the same places as things sometimes like to pop out of nowhere and several cases of intense pixelhunting. Nothing too major but the game likes to add extra constraints so you very well may just have to restart everything in the character's story from the beginning if you spend too much time wondering why is that crucial magnifying glass only materialises after you have that drink with an oldman.\n\nAnd, of course, bugs. The game enjoys freezing on you if you dare to do things in the unusual order. As a result I had to restart Benny's scenario 3 times simply because he never woke up from that horrible dream...\n\nBut even despite all this and at times incomprehensible ending sequence (the spiritual [moral] barometer is a cool idea until it becomes a healthbar analog), in the end it's a decent adventure that has aged rather well and can easily quench an oldschool thirst. Just don't expect it to be polished even by the 90-s standarts.\n\n3/5","April 23, 2015","true","9.9"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

But there are some things in this game that just didn't cut it for me, seeing how hyped this game has been over the years, always being mentioned in "best point and click/adventure games of all time" threads all over the internet, I don't really see why. Sure the story is very unique (and the short story is probably 10 times better) but I really couldn't feel that dark and twisted feeling that most people did.\n\nOk on to the parts that made me give this game a thumbs down. Oh and like many others who have played this game, I live and breathe point and click/adventure games. I grew up during the 80's with the big 3 on the NES (Deja Vu, Shadowgate, Uninvited) and I played my fair share of the Sierra/Lucas arts games during the years. So no "trolling" here. This review will probably get down rated anyway :)\n\nThe first big turnoff in the game is "trial and error" part, don't get me wrong I love a hard adventure game (took me months to beat Myst without a walkthrough). But this game forces you to either pick up a walkthrough (which I dislike) or save your game every time you interact with something. Why? Because if you screw up even the slightest you can't complete the game. And the worst part is that the game doesn't even tell you that you screwed up. So either spam that save/load button or stick to your walkthrough as soon as you pick it up, because you will need it more than once if you don't want to go mad. In the end I think I were suffering more than the characters in the game due to this mechanic.\n\nThe second thing that really killed it for me was the overall atmosphere over the characters. I saw some other comments like this under the reviews and it feels good that I'm not the only one noticing this. But these characters (without spoiling too much) have been tortured for over 100 years, and they just seem so... full of spirit.. At least some of them, some characters even joke around when your play them (Ellen). This is why I didn't feel the "horror" and darkness in the game. I really didn't feel like these characters were suffering or anything. You might think that these people were walking disasters after 100 years of mental and physical torture, but nope! I didn't care for any of the characters, I just wanted to skip to the next one all the time and sadly it never got better, only worse. And the ending was a HUGE meh, giving me a feeling like I have been doing everything for nothing (yes I got the best endings).\n\nOne other small problem I had with the game is the amount of bugs, stuff disappearing and multiplying (you pick up a key only for it to reappear when you reenter the room). Doors you can walk through sometimes and sometimes not because you have to "use" the door. But hey it's an old game, I can let that one slide.\n\nTL;DR  There are plenty of other horror adventure games out there with a more twisted and darker story (yes I said it) than this one. So save your money or buy a game like The Cat Lady instead and watch a complete walkthrough of this game on youtube.","February 8, 2015","false","7.0"," 45 of 75 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","45","75","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathmyrk/recommended/245390/","deathmyrk","deathmyrk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathmyrk/","271 products in account","“I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” gives an interesting take on the mythos surrounding mortality and consequence. The game plays as an adaptation of the short story written by uber-famous sci-fi extraordinaire Harlan Ellison, onto which humanity is put at an ultimate test.  Those who are familiar with titles such as “Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem” will feel well at home with this title; as each game not only amasses a variety of time pieces, but contains different stories that in some ultimate fashion fasten together for a grand conclusion.\n\nThe game kicks off in a pseudo “System Shock 2” manner in which a supercomputer named AM—reminiscent of “2001: A Space Odyssey” HAL—selects five members on which to do his bidding… namely torturing these poor souls to relive their greatest guilt in an unending cycle in such the style of Hell. Each character only remembers bits and pieces of their past, but do not remember what terrible offense they had committed to deserve such cruelties. Later exploration consists of a psychological exodus where they slowly come to a moment of realization; it is normally at that moment where AM—in one final and desperate tactic—lays out an ultimate torture for each subject.\n\n“I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” is accompanied by a sharp script that is borderline twisted and amusing; it defines dark humor amidst a tale of tragedy and desperation. The script is elevated also by the unique performances of the cast, including none other than Harlan Ellison who voices AM. There is an array of emotions by each character that not only draws a gamer deeper into unraveling the mysteries, but at some moments also feel for the character, as if accompanied. The subject matter in all its seriousness provides a great contrast to an otherwise campy story that, had it been crafted in any other manner, might not have been taken as seriously in other games. “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” not only knows the balance between comedy and tragedy but does a flaming knife juggling on unicycle act. There are very few science fiction writers that have accomplished such things—the closest to come to mind is Philip K. ♥♥♥♥, who wrote countless short stories including “We Can Remember it for You Wholesale” which inspired Paul Verhoeven’s 1990 sleeper hit “Total Recall,” basically another story that balances itself between tragedy, comedy, and campiness.\n\nThe gameplay as a whole is decent for the most part; not the lengthiest or most challenging of adventure games in the market. Seasoned adventure veterans could go through this title in a solid 2-3 hours; casuals, add at least 2 hours to that notch. The game is more story-driven than anything, and the locations aren’t incredibly large. The game does call for a great deal of backtracking, but on a plus note there is very minimal handholding. There is a consequence system. Consequences are measured by the actions gamers take: whether they completely miss a step, mess up on a puzzle, choose the not-so-nice conversational responses, reflects on a character portrait. The more you do a faulty job, or the wrong choices you make, affects the colorization of the border in a character portrait, leading to a different outcome endgame. It is basically your average in-game report card before stats started lingering the gaming market. Some would argure that the system mandates are unjust, that the game wants you to basically follow a set pattern and offer very little room for freedom of choice. In the contextual realm of “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” it fits very well with the philosophical nature of the game.\n\nIf there were any complaints to be made, it was that I wanted more. Each chapter offers small episodes for each character, and they are each original in their very nature. Some romps are more amusing than others. But when the grand—and I mean grand—finale of the game comes to a close, I was left as much satisfied by the delivery as I did emptied. On a positive note, the game does have multiple ways in which the game can end, depending on which character you would choose to perform the final actions. The puzzles remain the same, but any prior knowledge one particular character has effects certain situations in the final stage. While such a variety was interesting, there still remained little to no difference in other departments outside of the story. Does that sour the overall experience I have had with the game? Not in the least. “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” does  contain a very interesting story—filled to the brim with references to other literary works and historical moments—outside of its rather primitive and linear level designs, but it is a game that has switched enough mental gears to make it an overall unforgettable experience, especially for those who have an appreciation for older titles. The game is ultimately affected by its concise duration, even for a game made right after the transition from DOS/floppy disk titles, which can stint game completion (by those who have memorized the game full and through) to under an hour. While it may thematically reflect the length of a short story, "I Have No Mouth, and Must Scream" painfully makes me wish it were rather the length of a novel.\n\nPresentation: 8.5/10\nGameplay: 7.5/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nSound: 8.5/10\nReplay Value: 6.5/10\nOverall: 7.8/100\n\nFinal Analysis: “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” provides an entertaining adventure through the ages. While the adventure is cut short by content value, it more than makes up for both story, originality, and personality. Adventure fans may find some interest to be had from this title, anyone else regard it with caution—albeit it has aged fairly, “I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream” requires patience, persistence, and a sense of appreciation for games of yesteryear. Definitely worth discount price; anything more than 5 dollars is a swindle.","October 16, 2014","true","8.8"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

It is a dystopian tale set 109 years after a sentient supercomputer, AM, eradicated the entire human race… save for five, who are kept virtually immortal for AM’s sadistic pleasure.\n\nWhile the setup is the same, the novella and the game have different plots. The former was about the group trying to find canned food and eventually killing each other; the latter is split into five scenarios, all written by Ellison, exploring these people and their psyches by confronting them with their own (rewritten) past… a past some of them forgot during their long suffering. These stories are narrated by AM (voiced by Ellison), and the passive-aggressive tone does a great job filling them– and the player– with dread.\n\nAM’s twisted mind is reflected in the game mechanics and puzzles. As usual for a point ‘n’ click of that era, you mostly spend your time with hopeless pixel hunting, but there is an added mechanic: every scenario has several outcomes based on how thorough the player is finding and solving optional puzzles and tasks. If you can get the best outcome for everyone, you may have enough mental health to reach the end of the final puzzle and see the hidden optimistic ending; otherwise, you’ll see the canonical one.\nStrange enough, the “bad” ending somehow fits the story better; it is a pessimistic tale, a rare sight in adventure games. Rare enough to earn this one a place in the collection of all point ‘n’ click fans, even today.","September 23, 2015","true","9.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The meal costs you around $5, so as you wait for your meal to finish you aren't expecting anything exciting.  Actually, you assume the meal will be dry and boring.  But, still, $5 for a meal!\n\nAt this point, you still aren't expecting anything more than a drab way to satisfy your hunger.  As your name is called for the meal, you take it almost grudgingly, thinking back to other meals you could have bought with that $5.\n\nHowever, you begin your meal being mildly impressed with the soda selection.  You fill your cup to the brim with the best choice and turn around to find a table.  There, in the far corner is one far away from the habitual customers.  You go to the table and find that it is still clean.\n\nYour hopes suddenly begin to flare and you you eagerly open your bag.  Inside, you see a nicely made burger with seeds still attached to the bun (a delicacy at McD's), pickles are placed neatly on top of the patty, and the burger has a perfectly round and symmetrical shape to it.  You even received extra fries!  What more?  You turn to look at the counter and see the attractive employee who made your burger is smiling and winking at you.\n\nThis, of course, shocks you immensely as you only paid $5 and expected something much more bland than this satiating meal and even enjoyable experience.\n\nFrom now on, you make a promise to yourself not to judge cheap meals too harshly and know that, in the future, choosing a cheaper meal may be the best choice you make.\n\n\nThese feelings I have described below are precisely how playing I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream is like.\nBonus: you are given the short story the game is based on!

Although time flew from this game, it still maintains its place as one of the most noteable games of the past.\n\nGraphics:\nBack then, seeing how graphics are formed really kept us coming back for more on PC games. The graphics are mostly 2.5d, an appearance of 3d but acts as if it is 2d. Overall, the settings of the game on various scenarios were pretty good and well thought out.\n\nVoice Acting:\nWait, this game that is this old has voice acting?! Believe it or not, it does. I feel the actors really put theirselves in place of the character. However, I have to say that the voice acting of Nimdok was very terrible. It was annoying, slow, and monotonous. I know it was just an old guy, but come on learn to put some character in it (if only this review was done in the past).\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is more complicated than the traditional point-and-click adventures we normally see on Steam...well...judging from the games such as Anna, Enola, and Kairo. Certain things need to be "Push"ed, "Use"d, "Talk To"ed, "Look At"ed, to "Give" stuff to, and rare cases "Swallow"ed. Yes, those commands plus "Walk To" to move and "Take" to take certain items. Regardless of that, you can easily learn from trial and error.\n\nThe goal of the game, although not specified, is not to lose spirit, aka the background surrounding the character portrait in the playthrough. You cannot lose any spirit at all. You'll notice that you've maxed out when your portrait turns from green to white at the end of the scenario (excluding one). Thankfully, if you made a mistake, you can save at any time and any scenario during the game.\n\nThe only problem is that during Nimdok's scenario, just simply using "Talk To" can instantly kill you. Also, some things are not reversible and certain scenarios are "needle in a haystack" type, in this case, trying to get the best ending for the game.\n\nStory:\nI have to say the stories were creative during the 90s era. While I have seen more disturbing things in other games and the internet, I do say they still captured the feel of chaos and fear in a demonic sense. Each story is unique to each character, going from someone who abuses to another person being abused, and others who look for forgiveness or those who commonly lose their way by fulfilling desires.\n\nOverall: Regardless of some annoyances in gameplay, "I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" is a memorable classic that is part of the history of PC gaming. The stories of the characters can leave you feeling a bit heartbroken, sad, angry, remorseful, and even turning the other cheek. While most old video games get lost in the junk pile like AM's hellhole, this one stands out like a gem and rises up to continue to be noticeable in the history of gaming.","March 27","true","10.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","3"

It's disturbing but that's what it is supposed to be so be prepared for that, there's no happy-go-lucky endings with flowers and candy. What you're striving for is that each character makes amends with themselves and people around them.\n\nI really liked this game but it was on the harder side, I got stuck a lot of times since the things you had to do wasn't always obvious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/recommended/245390/","infindima","A. Yeager","http://steamcommunity.com/id/infindima/","680 products in account","This is most likely one of the most dreariest and unhappiest games you will come across. And that is why I love it. Based on a short novel, this game is like a alternative version of the story which explores each character individually. In the original novel, they didn't have that much of a personality and the novel ends too quickly before you get to know them.\n\nThings I like\nCharacters\nThey all have their unique personality and backstory, which are played out the more you explore each of their story chapters. You really do feel for these characters and their fates, and the game is filled with many heartbreaking scenes. There are also plenty of background characters that affects you emotionally, because you get to see so much suffering in this game.\n\nVoiceacting\nThe voices suits the characters perfectly and it's awesome that the original author, Harlan Ellison, voices the supercomputer AM. He does a fantastic job with the voiceacting. The only voice that was meh was Ted, I think the actor tries to hard to speak softly, which suits the character, but makes the acting seem very forced.\n\nDire consequences\nYou do have some choices, although they mostly lead to death, that you can choose throughout the story. It isn't like Telltale where it will shape the outcome, but it's interesting to see what happens.  I have to admit though, I laughed when they are sacrificing the poor woman and you can have Benny ask "Can I eat her?".\n\nStory\nThere's no happy ending, there are no moments of joy you can celebrate in, because AM will quickly make sure the character suffers shortly after. You are faced with difficult topics of murder, ♥♥♥♥, torture, suicide, cannibalism, human experiments, betrayal, abuse. I love the fact that this story dares to be this dreary. I can understand though why they removed the scene where  Benny is shown eating in infant. While only depicted in shadows, the scene is still disgustingly graphic. In the game, Benny will simply wonder where the baby is and he never eats it.\n\nThings I disliked\nNo character interaction\nUnlike the novel, unfortunately, you never see the characters interact with each other. This is extremely unfortunate as there seemed to be a lot of character development going on between Ted and Ellen, but this never gets explored enough. You mostly see how Ted feels about her through his chapters, but nothing is shown from her point of view.\n\nPossible to get permanently stuck without continuation\nI am not sure if this is a fatal flaw in the design, or a deliberate thing. In Gorristers chapter, if you chose to strangle Edna instead of forgiving her. , you basically spend the rest of the game mindlessly walking around without ever being able to finish his chapter. Usually when you do something horrible or unaccaptable, AM will interupt the story and send you back to the beginning. I wasted 3 hours on this chapter because I truly wanted to complete it without a guide, so I was extremely frustrating when I gave up and read the game was not possible to complete due to me chosing the wrong option. And no, you can't undo the option once you get the wrong one.\n\nIt also seem you can screw up the last part of the game unless you pick Nimdok first. Since that was my least favorite character, naturally I played with everybody else and messed things up.","February 14, 2015","true","11.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It resembles your typical point-and-click adventure game. I believe it is a different kind of adventure game due to how dark and disturbing the story is. You play as five different characters who have spent the last 109 years trapped with an insane machine with a serious megalomaniacal complex. You are tortured over and over by the God like machine. You are given a chance to finally end your suffering by completing a personal scenario that is unique to each of the characters. Most of the game consists of you playing these scenarios before reaching a sixth scenario that makes up the end game. Each of these scenarios can be completed in a number of different ways with one ideal way which will bring the character to his or her moral salvation. This is fairly limited by todays standards, but was impressive at the time and really results in "do something noble or do something cowardly".\n\nThe gameplay is fairly reminiscent of a Lucasarts SCUMM interface, clickable verbs are what allows you to interact with the world. The puzzles are quite complex compared to other adventure games with some really tough sections which can be frustrating. The graphics are impressive from a game published in 1995. It's a dark and gloomy setting that is suitable for the macabre subject matter. It's depressing and that's what makes the game quite special. The music and sound effects also contribute to this feeling of dread.\n\nThe game explores concepts that aren't really covered in many other games. It's unsettling, but entertaining. It can be tough if you aren't used to adventure games. If you are an adventure game fan and haven't played it then, I highly recommend it.","January 12, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Regardless of the issues spawned by IHNMAIMS' age, this is an excellent take on the famous short story and, in the world of videoame storytelling, parallels the influences of Ellison on techno-dystopian fiction. The game itself is an intriguing point-and-click that offers the player a peculiar menagerie of tension, fright, curiosity, and apprehension for the PCs. The story is akin to a visual novel, an interesting perspective for the modern gamer looking back into the history of storytelling in videogames (let alone science fiction games).

The gameplay itself actually remains very simple, while pushing you to your limit. While most of the required choices and clicks make logical sense, you still really do pretty much need a guide to lead you on your way to the "good" ending. Things need to be done in a particular order, clicked a specific number of times, etc. to get there, and so one can easily get lost. I will say, it is very dark, and definitely full of very mature adult themes. There are some glitches as well, though only one I encountered was actually "game breaking," and it worked fine on the second attempt. This is one of those games that I feel like I will need to revisit again sometime in the future, and is worth it even at full price.","May 11, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The controls are really annoying (have to use different options to open doors or just walk into a different scene even though it's a point and click) and it really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off about halfway through the game.\n\nPros: cursing, offensive situations, psychotic computer bent on torturing humans for all eternity, the game would anger religious-type people, interesting scenes (for a game that looks like it's from 1992).\n\nCons: I really liked that it reminded me of old Sierra games but GOOOODDDDDAAAAAMN this game was frustrating.

AM has trapped these unfortunate five in a chamber in the hollowed out core of the destroyed Earth and is torturing these people. Not only that, that AM has altered to them to not age and be impervious to harm, meaning they can be tortured forever. When I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream starts out, Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted, after 109 years of torture and humiliation, find themselves at a pillar with a burning message about how AM hates them etched into. AM tells them about a new "game" to play and asks "Which of you five would like to play my little game?" It's there that you can pick which of them should go first. When you make your pick, that survivor is whisked away to a strange place somewhere in time, where AM is watching them. There, you must make choices as what to do next and must help that unfortunate human solve the mystery of what is going on. After you beat a character's story, you must complete another character's story. In order to beat I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, you must make the right choices and prove that humans are better than machines. If you can beat all the stories making the right choices, Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted may have a chance at escaping AM and finally being free of their torments.\nThe game is unique in it's gameplay and story, and is one of the scariest games I've ever played. There are no cheap jumpscares like in Five Night's at Freddy's, nor massive amounts of gore like Harvester. The game has a general feeling of hopelessness and a very dark atmosphere, and what's more is that aside from brief moments of attacking something, Gorrister, Benny, Ellen, Nimdok and Ted have no real way of defending themselves aside from outwitting their adversaries. Even worse is the fact that you're always being watched, and unless you can outwit your stalker, you're just going to suffer more and more toment. All of the survivors are also pretty saddening too. They've all suffered what no-one should ever have to suffer in AM's complex, and they're all pretty messed up. Gorrister seeked death before he was captured by AM, Benny has been mutated into a sentient chimpanzee by AM, Ellen suffered something terrible in the past, Nimdok was old before AM captured him and has guilt for something horrible he can't remember doing, and Ted is even more paranoid than me (Until I played this game, I wasn't sure if that was possible) because he did something in the past. And yes, there is a good bit of disturbing imagery along the way.\nI Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream is truely a terrifying game which I'd recommend if you're a horror fan or want to play something original rather than all the first-person shooters that are everywhere nowerdays. However, if you are sensitive to ethical subjects like suicide, Nazism, ♥♥♥♥, paranoia, insanity and guilt, I wouldn't recommend getting the game, as it has all those themes in it. Oh, and if you don't have a walkthrough of the game in another window or a friend to help you through, you won't get very far. Yeah, it's that hard.\nSay hi to Nimdok for me!","December 26, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/recommended/245390/","Sweatbandz","A_Sweatband","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sweatbandz/","254 products in account","I have no Mouth, and I Must Scream is one of those Good Old Games on Steam. This Good Old Game uses DOS emulation to run on modern systems, meaning that there are naturally some problems with the emulation (this is also present in the GoG version). I have no Mouth, and I Must scream is based on the short story by the insane genius writer, Harlan Ellison, who plays the insane genius super computer, The Allied Master Computer (or A.M.). Your goal is to be free from A.M., while preserving your humanity and this game gives you a many chances to ♥♥♥♥ it up. Unlike modern games with multiple stranding choices, if you screw up, you will not get a good ending, but a different ending.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a standard Good old point'n'click PC game. It plays like many of these games, and without its atmosphere, IHNMAIMS would be an average game of its era, however, due to its theme, it stands out. There isn't rally too much to say about its gameplay, as it is really extremely standard for its genre.\n\nVisually and sound-wise, it's solid and really stands out for its era. The themes it goes across throughout the story are made all the more memorable by the use of visuals and sound. The sound is not perfect mind, some of the voice acting is very... odd, and seems almost out of place in a game that appears to take itself so seriously.\n\nThe story is what the game is all about, and for the most part, it tells the story of the short story very well. The plot is centred around how far you'll go to maintain your sanity and morality in some very unique game sections. However, some themes that define the characters are poorly represented in some places, but despite this, there are moments in this game that many other games never quite meet.\n\nDespite these flaws, this is one of the highlights of the classic PC games on Steam. I have to recommend it to everyone who wants to try something different, it may be massively niche, but the game itself, outside of these weaknesses, is a great, cheap title that I have to recommend, and its great that Steam and GoG can allow games like this a chance to be discovered by a newer audience, such as me, who missed this the first time around. This is Cyberdreams finest hour.","July 14, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an interesting story that keeps you interesed, although in the end the overarching plot ends up being weaker than the stories of each individual character. Each character scenario can be challenging but the puzzles never get to be really moon-logicky, though admittedly some are easier than others, at least if you're trying to get the best ending for each character. There's no real "game over" except in the last scenario, which is also frustratingly cryptic, I ended up just looking up the solution because I couldn't be bothered. The voice acting of the main character (by the writer himself) I did enjoy a fair bit, as well, though on the opposite end, Nimdok's is not very good. The music ranges from creepy to unpleasantly dissonant, some is good, some is bad. The graphics look quite good for its age, though. I'd recommend it but I wouldn't highly recommend it.","December 3, 2013","true","12.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/245390/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a bad game.\n\nThis 1995 point and click adventure, incredibly loosely based off Harlan Ellison's 1967 short story and co-designed by Ellison himself, shows its age and not in the usual way, though not in a way that marks it as the bad game it is. Those particular reasons are timeless.\n\nThroughout the game, you're taken through five "psychodramas", which you can choose at your own leisure and each centering around a particular character with their own sordid history full of metaphor and mental allegory reminiscent of Psychonaut's own Dreamworlds (though obviously, this game came first), and an end sequence. There are a variety of actions you can complete in each scenario that either lowers or raises each character's "Spiritual Barometer", a basic morality system that, given the completely arbitrary and unsignposted actions that alter them, is thankfully nearly completely worthless on its own.\n\nThe art design is fantastic, with the intentionally ugly humanoid sprites laid thickly on richly detailed backgrounds that range from rusting iron plates to cerebral nightmarescapes, to one incredibly memorable locale that invokes the late H R Giger's biomechnical designs. The animation is negligible, which is more than acceptable given the time period the game was made in and the memory constraints developers had to work with, but does its job well enough.\n\nVoice-acting and dialogue within I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream are executed very well, along with the noticeably good sound design in general, but have aged into campy and ridiculous conversations and reactions.\n\nPlaying as a tortured girl having a mental breakdown from confronting her [Hymen Highwayman] shouldn't be funny, but when the [Hymen Highwayman] in question is a Saturday-morning cartoon villain and the follow up is a sassy one-liner accompanied by a hilarious uppercut it's impossible to take seriously. This permeates the entire game. AM doesn't sound like a malevolent god going steadily crazy inside his suffocating shell, he sounds like the Joker phoning in his lines after a particularly strong hangover. The entire script has fermented into a vassal of ham and stifled laughter.\n\nOnly exceptions to this are Benny and Ted, the former who despite the massive overhaul to his character still comes across as a convincing racist military officer, and the latter whose entire storyline and character are just weak and forgettable. Despite the obviously unintentional retrospective of the narrative it's still enjoyable on its own.\n\nNone of the above remotely contributes to why I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream is a bad game. At worst it'll make you sad that, if you played it like my own playthrough ended up, you won't leave this game with the sense that you have truly managed to appreciate Ellison's narrative and tackling of themes that are usually not even whispered about in videogames, but with a steaming sense of frustration, regret that you ever bothered with the game, and a throbbing headache from having to replay the same sections over and over because you didn't managed to abuse save-states as much as they obviously expected you to.\n\n"Unsignposted Dead Ends". Innocuous actions which lock you into an unwinnable state, that the game does not notify you about or otherwise point out at all. You just wander around until your ever-decreasing cup of patience runs dry, trying to pick up another loose thread on the game's already obtuse and thoroughly unenjoyable puzzles, wondering if you're just missing a vital interaction or you have truly just screwed over your playthrough and you don't know how, when or why. One of the most hilarious examples had me complete an action that locked me into a dead state at the beginning of  a scenario, but still let me get through almost entirety of of the scenario anyway, only locking out the last ten seconds of puzzle before the ending. It happened an average of once per scenario, each necessitating a complete restart if you've saved at the wrong moment.\n\nDon't buy this game, folks, save your time, money, and the few non-aching brain cells you have left on something else. Anything else. It's not worth it.\n\nAnd the game was designed like this on purpose. Someone sat down, and decided that assuming you had to pour water on the electronics a second time due to dialogue, or giving the pliers to the wrong starving victim at the wrong moment, was going to lock you out of completing the game and they weren't going to do a damn thing about it, not even update that otherwise useless hint book of theirs. Why?\n\nI Have No Clue And I'm About To Scream.\n\nEDIT: As ridiculous and insulting as [Hymen Highwayman] is, Steam censors the alternative so they get the ridiculous and insulting name for a sexual assaulter, and their filter can blow me.","February 27, 2015","false","10.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you don't put the jar with the eyes in the box (but not any of the other stuff you're carrying), you will fail that character's story and be unable to complete the game.  I want to emphasize that there is no reason to actually combine the jar and the box.   There's no hint.  Nothing.  You just have to randomly decide to do it.  And this is not the only seemingly random action required to complete the story.  That's just the careless way the game was designed.\n\nSo after fnishing a section incorrectly, you can either reload a save a try again--though you likely won't get it the second time either without the walkthrough--or, if you were careless with your saving, start completely over.\n\nIt's just a potentially great game that suffers from the odd design choice to let players fail with no ability to retry and little direction on what went wrong.","December 23, 2014","false","1.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The game's greatest asset is its ability to sustain mood and tension while at the same time roughly following the plot of the novella whithout sacificing the moral ambiguity. Gameplay-wise, the puzzles range from easy to obtuse, with the difficulty ratcheting up as you get closer to completing all of your characters' story arcs. I remember the finale to be quite frustrating (no spoilers!), but overall even despite this game's admittedly dates graphics and music, it is very much worth your time. 8/10","November 28, 2013","true","3.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some characters have their reasons for being where they are fleshed out while others are only mildly hinted at. The puzzles and interface haven't aged too well. The interface is finicky at times and interacting with certain objects or pick ups will lead you to some frustrations wondering what you should do next.

No. When it released, people praised it for its admittedly mature handling of serious ethical issues and artfully crafted atmosphere, but now, it's just not good. Its graphics, point-and-click gameplay mechanics, and overall presentation from 1995 have aged hideously - the game's "spooky" parts and cringe-worthy voice acting become just bad enough to be laughable at worst and just plain weird at best. I Have No Mouth moves at a mentally challenged snail's pace; illogical "puzzles" hinder your progress in the game, and without a walkthrough to occasionally consult, it'll take you anywhere from 10 to 20 hours to complete the game.\n\nAs an added insult, Harlan Ellison's original short story of the same name is made very difficult to comprehend due to some obligatory plot changes and multiple endings/storylines to worry about. Several bugs, glitches, and awkward/antiquated mechanics will make your playthrough even more miserable. What's truly perplexing is that the author himself was one of the main driving forces (writer, director) behind the creation of this game.

The other characters do an alright job but you really should feel tempted to do everything you can in this game just to hear more of AM.\n\nEllison wanted a morality system that mattered in this game, which yields more or less mixed results. You might make a few first-time mistakes due to not understanding stuff ahead of time, but most moral choices are subtle and not nearly as cringe-worthy as HARVEST LITTLE SISTER?

The german censors didn't seem to care either, so they just cut the character you have to click to enter that path, this can however be fixed by changing your steam language to english.\n\nBut even if you manage to get it running without the issues of the german version, you are still faced with a bad game.

You randomly enter a fantasy castle and have to face witches and demons for example.\n\n-the pointing and clicking is unintuitive.

My favorite is a bathroom that only contains a magnifying glass after you talk in a certain way to a certain NPC with the best part being that it's very small, easily overlooked and that you are not informed that anything in the bathroom changed.\n\nPositive points:\n-it can be terrifying if you are easily scared\n-the graphics and sounddesign, excluding the horrible voicework, is solid\n-there are mutiple ways to finish a puzzle, although the game prefers some over others","February 24, 2015","false","9.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

This game was actually pretty nice for a DOS game. Better than that hogwash this "Five Nights at Freddy's" Crud the kids talk about Nowadays. Lemme see here...where's the floppy drive?"\n\nSTORY: To not spoil much for you, I'll say this: Picture a world, where the Machine won. Instead of a Skynet feel, you get that the human race, is long gone. You play as one of the members, of a 5-person group, each with their own fears, problems, and you gotta figure out how to help. Bottom line: It's enticing, and leaves you with a genuine warmth for having help solve their life problems.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Being that it's a point and Click Adventure game, your main duty is to achieve completion of a series of puzzles. Some are more difficult than the other, some are straightforward, but still leave you wondering a few minutes on how to solve it. But once you learn how to do it, after really thinking about it? You get that genuine "Aha!" Feeling, which to me is a great reward, and then, you can see the fruits of your labor, into a good ending.\n\nSOUND: The music is chilling and atmospheric, and leaves you with a longing for more of it as you go through each character's story.

There's not enough direction, and with so many things to click and several different actions, a majority of the time is spent rotating through actions and items and the rest of the time is wasted on walking animations, which take way too long. So it takes forever to get from one action to the next without a walkthrough, and overall it's a pretty shameful waste of time and money.","December 20, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Dear lord his voice acting is horrible. His German accent is the most cliche accent I have ever encountered. I could not take him seriously.\n\nThat small problem aside, the game comes from an era where game length was increased by mandatory replay. Each time you play a character through, you can make bad and good choices, but making bad choices will ultimately make you lose the game. And a choice you made 15 minutes earlier will irrevocably make the game unfinishable.\n\nThe game does a horrible job of giving you feedback. When you do something right, it will play a jingle that blends in easily to the games music. Maybe you will see something light up on the portrait. Otherwise, there are no other cues given.\n\nI wanted to like this dark deep look at human nature, but like almost every game I've played from 10+ years ago, our nostalgia is overwriting our experience.\n\nIf you want the experience, just watch someone play it on youtube.","June 27, 2015","false","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/footissimo/recommended/245390/","footissimo","Footissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/footissimo/","510 products in account","Possibly worth it for the Nostalgia..\n\nI suspect that, in the mid nineties, this game got a lot of attention and attained a certain status because it's an adaptation of a short story that has a bit of a following, but really, it isn't that good.  I mean, taking into account that it's nearly 20 years old..and that the graphics / sound are going to be a bit limited, it still seems that it got more praise than it actually deserved.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm all for games that make you think, wonder and want to find out more but the story and challenges in IHNMAIMS really don't do that; they're not intriguing, just frustrating..and it gets worse as you go along.  How do I enter this other area that I need to do so to complete the game?  Well clearly you need to flush a toilet three times!  That must be so obvious as to not need any kind of hint or relevant dialogue.  Further on, I need to inspect this pixel clump with this recently found item (that was another hidden pixel clump) so I can solve the mystery that I didn't realise was a mystery.  Easy!\n\nIt's moon logic, but the bad sort.\n\nAs I said, I can't really criticise the game for not using modern sound playback - this is mostly limited to parts that are voice acted, but, to be honest, I'd preferred if they'd saved those megabytes and kept to text.  Really, it goes between barely acceptable to cringingly awful.  The main antagonist (voiced by the actual author of the short story) is so bad as to be laughable, the only female character is a horrible stereotype who sounds like she's having *so* much fun.  The nazi doctor is just 'no' - I can only guess that there's a lack of germanic sounding people in the world.  The voice acting / scripting is so bad that I found myself just clicking through it as soon as I realised that it was something that I'd heard before, lest I gnaw my knuckles raw.\n\nMidi music was so badly done that I thought that I'd messed up my midi settings on my PC (I hadn't) and the much talked about 'dark themes' weren't dark at all for one of the characters..and for another were made so ridiculous as to have me giggling in serious scenes.\n\nLastly, I got stuck on some of the challenges, not because I hadn't worked out what needed to be done, but because I hadn't done things in the exact path that the game expected.  Seriously.  Either allow multiple paths to solutions and trigger off the next event or only allow one path.  Making it so that you have to reload an old save or somehow backtrack does not make for fun times.\n\nOn the plus side, it's fairly cheap, it does actually work and it may encourage people to read so to find out why people were so excited about the game.  Oh, and it does come with the proper digital soundtrack, but just not in-game for some bizarre reason.","November 26, 2013","false","9.9"," 18 of 50 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","18","50","0","3"

I would've been just 8 years old in 1996 when this game was released so it's no wonder I didn't hear of it back then. It's definitely not *meant* to be a game for kids tho I'm sure plenty have played it. After hearing of it on YouTube, I hunted down the short story & read it then immediately went looking for a physical copy of the game on ebay. Being such an old, rare game, it was too expensive to buy so I settled with the fact that I'd never get to play it. Until now! It's everything I hoped for. I recommend that everyone reads the story then plays this game. It's a classic. It's challenging & fun. Best of all, it's weird - dark & twisted - a game unlike any other.

Ham-fisted political opinions draw you right out of a game, and just about any sort of perspective from the developer is only worthy of an eye-roll and a groan. This particular game is not of that variety.\n\nThis game, based on the post-apocalyptic sci-fi short story by Harlan Ellison, is the paragon of point-and-click 90s adventure games. If you fondly reminisce about these kinds of games, you will not be disappointed. This is just about the perfect game you can purchase to satisfy your nostalgia kick. If you aren't familiar, this is the perfect way to introduce yourself to a piece of video game history.\n\nIn this game, you play as five deep characters with different issues and personalities. To complete the game, you need to solve a series of problems they encounter in scenarios presented by the main antogonist, who you'll surely be introduced to soon enough. The puzzles require a sharp eye and creative mind to complete, with the endings entirely determined by how well you performed each chapter. Although some parts are not very intuitive, vigilance is key and well worth the effort.\n\nMore important than the puzzles is the setting, which becomes an integral part of the story. Each character's setting is incredibly important to understanding the character themselves, and the effort put forth to creating such a deep game is apparent from minor details to the themes themselves. Some of the topics covered seem to have pretty obvious "correct opinions": ♥♥♥♥ is wrong, infidelity only leads to heartbreak, Dr. Mengele isn't someone you invite to your twins' birthday party, etc. With this comes important themes contingent throughout all stories, ranging from forgiveness to perseverance and chivalry. To appreciate all of the effort the developers and original author put into every intricate piece of the software, I would highly suggest taking your time and not rushing from one decision to the next. Carefully move forward, because like a lot of 90s games, this game will punish you for failure as harshly as it can.\n\nThis game has a few minor flaws, and appeals to a certain demographic of players. These things can really turn some people off of a game entirely, but I would wager 75% of people who purchase this game will love it and 24% of people who purchase this game will at least appreciate the experience. It is worth every cent.","August 7, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pluis, the complexity and depth of the story is something you are not to expect from a 1995 game, a lot of people might even found the story of the game disturbing.\n\nThat being said, you should not expect too much from this game. Don't forget, this game is nearly 20 years old, there are a lot of stuff happened during this time period. So you may not find satisfied by the narrative experience: it is a point-and-click game afterall, and an average one even in its own age(from the term of gameplay, of course),  considering this genre died over ten years ago, it is not surprising if someone think it is not impressing at all.\n\nThe story itself is somewhat disappointing, too. Depending on your personal exeprience, you may even think the story is cliched or too light hearted if you have touched games or other forms of media sharing a similar setting and tone (and trust me, there is A LOT of this stuff out there, and quite a few of them are better than this one).\n\nGo ahead and play it if you don't familiar with either this kind of story(consult store page for the brief introduction, I will not spoil anything here) or point-and-click games, else, you can have a try, but with a lower expectation.

Despite it supposedly deals with dark aspects of humanity, it is much less dark and crude than Harlan Ellison´s original short story. Still, I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys adventure games, especially if they are sci-fi fans.\n\nThe game was developed by Harlan Ellison himself, so it is one of those -rare?- opportunities to experience a game that takes you the way the author of the original story would have devised it to go. I guess Mr. Ellison was satisfied with the result as he even lends his voice to AM!\n\nThe game recovers the IHNMAIMS story premise: 5 humans are forever trapped in the innards of a derranged computer (AM) who keeps them alive in order to torture them for eternity. In the game, AM has devised games that explore the background and nature of each of its subjects. Each human will have to confront his/her fears and flaws in the hope of getting some relief from their non-ending suffering. There are different ways of ending each individual scenario, depending on the moral choices taken. When getting to a character´s individual background game end, that character will not be present at the Hate Column. This may be achieved even with low moral choices (indicated by the character´s avatar background, called Spiritual Barometer, being dark instead of bright green or white). The better (brighter) your SB, the better chances you´ll have at the final part of the game.\nIt may also happen that a character´s performance leads to his/her death in that scenario. In these cases, AM delivers the character back to the Hate Column and he/she will eventually have to start their adventure from scratch.\n\nThe game has a peculiar logic. In order to get the best results, some decisions may not be as straightforward as they may appear, but I had no problem with that when considering I was supposedly playing in a world devised and controlled by nutty AM. It is an interesting ride, and I will be playing it at least a couple of times more to try different choices and see their outcomes.\n\nThe game has some bonus content, including John Ottman´s soundtrack (with a very retro feel), the original short story and an interesting Making of... pdf. Here it says the game can not be actually won in the traditional sense, and especially in this setting I found that quite appropriate. I got this in a sale, and even if you don´t like the game the scarcely 2$ are well worth the short story alone.\n\nThe game feels 20 years old in some of its design aspects, but that is part of the charm. It may also be a bit slow for some people as it dwells more in morals/psychology than in action. It may also feel a bit depressing for the subjects it covers.\nI didn´t love the voice actors, but it is cool to hear the author give life to AM. The women I found especially annoying and I for one would have taken Glyinis dancing just to avoid hearing her whining about it!\n\nBeing a Harlan Ellison fan I am very glad I got this, as it has already provided me with many more hours of gameplay than other, more modern, games.","March 29, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The atmosphere and story bring the dark and macabe of gaming to a whole other level, and having read Ellison's short myself the game does a fanastic job representing the work. If not better, as each character is delved into and explored. Though some aspects were left out, the story hardly suffers and is fantastic anyway.\nThe game functions as a point and click adventure with some easy puzzle solving elements and a morality scale that glows green when you solve problems or perform an action to mend the characters guilt or past transgressions, The game is less cheesy than it sounds, I promise.\nMy only complaints would be that the music becomes grating and sometimes, when i would pause and unpause, my character would walk off the screen and into the distance until the vanished, or get stuck on randomobjects and not respond to any commands.

This game suffers less from the tropes of point-and-click adventure games than most, but they're still there: you will find yourself doing the "try using everything in your inventory on the thing in the game world" routine on occasion, as well as the "I know what to do but the game isn't letting me do it yet because I haven't satisfied some arbitrary precondition" one. The UI is typical for a game of its time (which is to say, a bit clunky by today's standards but not unusable). Voice acting is good. The story has an interesting premise, and is somewhat nonlinear in the sense that you can play through the various characters' subplots in any order.

The driving force here is story. The character development and rich "lore" (so to speak), will leave you begging for more. Every little piece ties in together so neatly.\n\nThis is the healthiest adventure title i have played to date. It ultimately combines science fiction, philosophy, psychology, and exploration into the tightest package. Morally ambiguous choices, and a helping of gory disgusting imagery, coupled with what i believe to be an amazing soundtrack really drives this piece forward. You cant help but wonder how such an old game slips under your radar.\n\nI do not want to spoil much of this title so I will keep this as vague as possible. Its an absolutely brilliant game, based off of a short story nonetheless, and its multiple endings and branching paths will keep you entertained. I highly recommend this to any person who enjoys a great story and can stomach some gross imagery. The symbolism and amounts of self-interpretation alone can give this game a solid score, but with everything else it deserves a solid 5.","July 1, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When I first discovered this game I was most interested in the fact that it was based off of a short story. It sounds so bizarre to me. Fast forward probably a year and I had entirely forgotten about it before seeing it on Steam. I turned it on and began playing and,honestly, I wasn't disappointed. It's a game that runs through strong writing and an interesting world. The characters are pretty well developed and the game puts them in situations where they work pretty well. I've never been good at point and clicks and the last time I bought a retro PC game was when I bought Fallout, which was hard for me to adapt to, however, with IHNMAIMS, I ended up playing for four hours without realizing. In my opinion, it's well worth the five dollars, not only because of the game, but it comes with the original short story, as well. Truly one of the most interesting games that I've played in a long time.","May 11, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I felt for the characters (and they do go through hell-- specifically, their own personal hells), and you get quite a few to play with.\n\nYou've got:\n\n1. Nimdok - ex-Nazi physician stuck in a concentration camp; forced to perform medical experiments on innocents to find 'the lost tribe'.\n\n2. Gorrister - man stuck in a zeppelin; suicidal over committing his wife to a mental institution; finds he is missing his heart.\n\n3. Ellen - ex-engineer stuck in an electronic pyramid, wall-to-wall of yellow (a colour she is afraid of); is given an opportunity to sabotage AM, but only if she can confront her yellow-clothed ♥♥♥♥♥♥ inside the yellow elevator.\n\n4. Benny - ex-military captain who killed his squad, degenerated to a brutish simian who can't express his intelligent thoughts; stuck in a stone-age community that regularly performs human sacrifices to AM.\n\n5. Ted - paranoid schizophrenic stuck in a medieval castle; his love, Ellen (alluding to the other Ellen), is slowly dying because of a curse cast on her by her wicked stepmother.\n\nThe gameplay goes beyond typical point 'n' click, featuring a revolutionary (for the time) morale system, where your actions and the choices you make dictates the outcome for the character. There are multiple endings, for each character, and for the endgame. Good and bad things can (and will) happen to the characters you controlled.\n\nOne of the best games I've played, and also one of the best point 'n' clicks.","October 19, 2013","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each character's psyche and story is unique, and the mechanisms that lead you through each of their exploits, as well as the final chapter, serve to not only deepen the characteristics of each individual as well as the lore, but lets the player learn more about these inherent fears, and possibly even something about themselves.\n\nWhile the mechanics are fairly basic as well as the hidden "moral" system, it is still an enjoyable and interesting ride, especially considering the ability to have multiple endings. The point-and-click genre of games is fairly known for having obtuse puzzles every now and then, and this one is no expection, but taking into account that the ultimate "good" ending in the game was suppose to virtually unreachable, it serves a purpose. The pixel graphics are still very well crafted, and the music and sound design are to be expected from this era.","May 10, 2015","true","16.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game uses a post-apocalyptic universe involving a malevolent A.I. to explore the various psychological and moral shortcomings that human beings have in general, and many of the choices you make will draw upon your personal ethics.  Sometimes, the right choice is very clear, but there are other moments when you're in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" kind of situation.\n\nFor this reason, the game can be quite challenging since the very best ending can only be obtained if you fill up the characters' Spiritual Barometers, and there are several ways to complete a scenario or die trying. Generally, you can increase your Spiritual Barometer by engaging in noble acts while avoiding ignoble ones, but I still had trouble figuring out which choices were the best for some characters (Ellen, in particular).\n\nThis is one of the main flaws in this game, as some of the puzzles are counterintuitive and require you to save and reload your game several times in order to achieve the best result.   Moreover, I encountered a couple game-breaking bugs during the end scenario and also when I played Benny.   You should definitely keep multiple saves before making a story-altering choice.\n\nDespite the game's technical and logical flaws, this is one of the most interesting and disturbing adventure games that I have ever played, and I highly recommend trying it out if you want to experience a great sci-fi/horror story.","September 29, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If not better, as each character is delved into and explored. Though some aspects were left out, the story hardly suffers and is fantastic anyway.\nThe game functions as a point and click adventure with some easy puzzle solving elements and a morality scale that glows green when you solve problems or perform an action to mend the characters guilt or past transgressions, The game is less cheesy than it sounds, I promise.\nMy only complaints would be that the music becomes grating and sometimes, when i would pause and unpause, my character would walk off the screen and into the distance until the vanished, or get stuck on randomobjects and not respond to any commands.

I'd recommend saving often and on many different save files in order to avoid unpleasant surprises.\n\nWhile most of the enigmas can be solved using the in-game hint system once you get a hang of it, it wouldn't hurt having a guide nearby just in case, especially if you are going for the "good" ending. Some scenarios are way easier than others (Ted and Ellen are the easiest, Nimdok is average difficulty unless you want the good ending, and Benny and Gorrister are really hard. The ending is practically impossible without a guide, unless you're an adept of die and retry, harcore level).\n\nBesides these technical questions, I have no mouth is a haunting, beautifully written and artistically flawless game like no other.

I don't know how I fill about this. Would I play it again? Certainly no. Do I recommend it? Well, yes, but be advised: this is a no-no for the weak of heart and the impatient.\nI Have no Mouth and I Must Scream is based on the short story by Harlan Ellison (who also voices the evil AI, AM). It's a terrifying tale of 5 people that AM tortures for 109 years, until it decided to let them either confirm its reasons for hating them or redeem themselves.\nAs far as gameplay goes, there are a lot of that can go wrong (pixel hunting, easily missable clues, annoying mechanics - for example, some doors will work with "use" and others with "walk to") and there isn't much to see here.\nThe big strength this game has is its storytelling. The story deals with some mature themes such as torture, ♥♥♥♥, murder. The journey to redeem each character isn't very long, it is though emotionally stressing. In case you want to get a specific ending, I'd highly recommend following a walkthrough, as you can easily miss some stuff and there is no going back once you do.\nOverall, this was an interesting experience.

You can just take it easy and enjoy the narration, but considering it is interactive, you must think before choosing your actions. Also do take note it's a horror story, but instead of cheap jumpscares common in today's horror genre, this game gives you the tension to always keep you on edge. "Did I do it right?" "Am I doing something wrong?" "What am I supposed to do to not mess everything up?"\n\nOverall, a great game if you're into reading.

The game uses a post-apocalyptic universe involving a malevolent A.I. to explore the various psychological and moral shortcomings that human beings have in general, and many of the choices you make will draw upon your personal ethics.  Sometimes, the right choice is very clear, but there are other moments when you're in a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" kind of situation.\n\nFor this reason, the game can be quite challenging since the very best ending can only be obtained if you fill up the characters' Spiritual Barometers, and there are several ways to complete a scenario or die trying. Generally, you can increase your Spiritual Barometer by engaging in noble acts while avoiding ignoble ones, but I still had trouble figuring out which choices were the best for some characters (Ellen, in particular).\n\nThis is one of the main flaws in this game, as some of the puzzles are counterintuitive and require you to save and reload your game several times in order to achieve the best result.   Moreover, I encountered a couple game-breaking bugs during the end scenario and also when I played Benny.   You should definitely keep multiple saves before making a story-altering choice.\n\nDespite the game's technical and logical flaws, this is one of the most interesting and disturbing adventure games that I have ever played, and I highly recommend trying it out if you want to experience a great sci-fi/horror story.","September 29, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It truly is one of the old classics of point and click adventure games with a great story and challenging puzzles. Rather than following the orginal story of "I have no mouth, and i must scream" it instead expands on the story and incoporates Ellisons other works into it aswell to create a fantastic game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hofpot/recommended/245390/","hofpot","Antipazifist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hofpot/","285 products in account",""I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream" is by far one of the grimmest point & click adventures ever made.\nThe five characters you'll play with and their associated settings are all different from each other and very diverse. Each character has it's own psychological traits and problems to solve. There is an old Nazi doctor working in a concentration camp, an IT specialist with fear of the colour yellow, an old war veteran coping with his crimes while on duty, and two other characters. The background story will leave all fans of postapocalyptic robocalypses in awe and is demanding when it comes to upcoming problems on dealing with supercomputers and AI. You'll make make a lot of mistakes during the course of the game which will lead to instant death or delayed problems in the endgame (don't forget to save frequently!). It has also quite a lot of replay value and lots of different endings.\n\nFinal verdict: 9/10","November 18, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can easily make it crash or perform actions that are seemingly not intended to be performed (yet). You can also rather easily break your save game, forcing you to replay some or all adventures over again. Whatever you do, always make sure you have more than one save-game going and save often.\n\nYou can also -die- in this game which forces you to restart the current adventure. Luckily, the game will let you know when this happens. It's a minor nuisance in comparison to breaking your save game and trying to figure out what to do for hours on end.\n\nThe game also has a tendency to 'spawn' items that weren't there before and 'locks' certain actions so you can only do them when the time is right. This is confusing because sometimes it doesn't and lets you perform actions prematurely, causing the aforementioned problem of breaking your game. And you might not think of performing an action again because you have already done so five times and it didn't work the first 5 times and the feedback given to you seems to indicate that it is simply not possible. Until it suddenly is.\n\nI was forced to use a walkthrough on a number of occasions: one involved pixel-hunting and the two other occasions involved me saving the game after I had made irreversible choices without the game telling me I had lost the game. Then there was the part about selecting the right character for the end-phase first otherwise you might ... You guessed it! Break your savegame.\n\nIf you can live with all of the above, IHNMaIMS is for you. If you are easily frustrated and think point 'n' click games shouldn't break your savegame; look elsewhere.","January 22","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
