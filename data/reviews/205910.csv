I also like this crazy story. You can cut and move almost every stone you encounter.  I'm loving cutting stones! Try to find your own path and search for different secrets.\n\nSome levels demand the player to arrive at certain places without a well pre-established way. So one need to cut, drag, push stone cubes/pillars/walls/beams etc. You can find alternative ways to beat levels, for example without cutting anything. There are also boss fight stages, where you should evade or cut down the stones thrown at you.\n\nAt last I talk about the achievements, 100% completion is not hard. The collection of all flashing stones in episode 4 is quite challenging. Pay attention to the stones on the top of all blue pillars (no guide or video for this achievement). It took me 10 hours in total to get all the achievements.","March 17, 2014","true","16.1"," 133 of 153 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","133","153","0","6"

The screen shots generally don't do it any justice making it an easily overlooked title; the name doesn't help either.\n\nThe graphics, although strange, are a suitable stylistic choice that fit well with the theme.  Likewise, the music is unusual but enjoyable.  A couple new tracks are hidden in each level, so finding them is a good idea if you want to expand the game's song list.\n\nThe most noteworthy design element in the game is the physics engine with the ability to cut pillars, statues, boulders and most other stone items.  It feels amazing to push, pull, and hack apart such large objects and dynamically alter the game environment.  The simple act of cutting objects at any angle without the use of voxels was something I had never seen before.\n\nI appreciated how the designers encouraged experimentation; most of the trial and error situations encountered aren't that painful.  Despite my low tolerance for gaming frustration and rather poor platforming skills this game won me over and I fought through.  It's a short game at 3-5 hours, but it has a lot of replay value if you enjoy achievement hunting.\n\nThose whom enjoy the exploration of platformers, will surely love hunting down hidden objects and discovering the various Easter eggs that Tiny & Big has to offer.  I enthusiastically recommend this somewhat underrated title to everyone.","December 10, 2014","true","14.3"," 82 of 89 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","82","89","4","7"

And you wonder why they havn't made a second one?!? :D Tiny and Big Grandpa's Leftovers is crazy. The music is crazy (and fun!), the gameplay is crazy (and fun!) the story is VERY crazy (and a lot of fun!), the characters (there are only 2 in the game) are comicly funny and entertaining. The gameplay is sandbox"ish". You can cut, pull and push almost every obstacle in the game. Carve yourself stairs to the top of that tower? Go for it. :) It's unique art style combined with that crazy music even creates a funny atmosphere. The game is packed with secrets and stuff to find. I replayed it twice, just to get most of the achievements (which are hilarious, too). The main character is accompanied by a radio that has the right phrase for every situation. Unfortunatly there are no voices in the game, so you have to read everything. That's kind of hard, while you're running for your life, trying not to get crushed.\nThe game is not very hard (but no, it is not EASY) and you'll see the credits after 3 hours. Plus achievement time. This game is worth every cent you spend on it. Stop reading!

Remember when you put your underwear on your head and tried to convince your college roommate's mother that you actually were a pseudo-Aztec god of the mole people?  And how you spent the next night in prison, where you met Thorn, who gave you that really sweet tat of Maya Angelou fighting a 4-winged serpent on your forehead?  That's what this game feels like.\n\nTiny and Big feels more like a dev studio showing off a fun physics engine than it does a fully fleshed-out game.  The platforming is sometimes difficult to figure out, mostly because you have to learn the mechanics of the game as you go along--after the tutorial levels, the hints are few and far between.  The "rocket" tool seems to have no reasonable use except to move large objects in unpredictable ways, leading to hilarious results.  And most of the game's challenges can be bypassed by using your cutting tool in ways that I do not believe the devs envisioned.\n\nRegardless, if you want to spend some time in a fun physics sandbox, where nearly the entire landscape is destructible, TaBGL is not a bad way to spend your hard-earned prison cigarettes while Thorn sterilizes another safety pin for round two of Angelou.\n\nBy the way:  GREAT name for a Kendrick Lamar cover band.","June 30, 2015","true","5.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","94","31","33","20","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/recommended/205910/","OneHandedSquire","OneHandedSquire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OneHandedSquire/","168 products in account","There is a question that is posed to every man in his life.  One question that he must endeavor to answer to his own satisfaction and to hell with the naysayers.  One choice between confining support or uncertain freedom that will ever after determine the fate of his junk:  boxers or briefs?  Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers would emphatically tell you that tighty whiteys are worth fighting for, yet everything about it feels loose, free, and spacious.\n\nWhy on Earth are you talking about underwear to describe a 3D platformer/physics puzzler, reviewer?  Because in T+B, you play as the titular Tiny, a young man on a quest to recover his grandfather's hand-me-down underpants that have been stolen by an unscrupulous bandito.  That's one of those ideas I can't possibly make more ridiculous than the game presents it.  And as a framing device, it works.  I've played more than a few puzzle games that have forgotten that you need to give your game a definitive character to make it stand out from the piles and piles of mental exercises that boil down to merely an expensive Sudoku.\n\nThe visual style looks like something Pendleton Ward might come up with if you limited his palette to muted blues and oranges and does a good job of communicating the game's overall character in a sort of graphic novel way.  The soundtrack to the game is also special enough to note.  It takes the form of cassette tapes that you collect and listen to on your radio and, in addition to providing more reason to explore, covers a wide range of engaging jams from latin beats to funk to rock n' roll.\n\nThat's all well and good, but if I'm going to put myself into Grandpa's Leftovers, I'd better get some play and the experience had better feel good!  Relax, reader.  Thanks to Tiny and Big you'll feel great grabbing your stones and watching them swing free and easy and that's nothing to say about whipping out your rocket and blasting away a huge load.  Yes, in Tiny and Big you will use your mining laser to cut up your environment and a winch and rocket to move the pieces you cut into place.  What did you think I was talking about?\n\nAnyway, the game strikes a nice balance between levels that are more freeform and open, like a sumptuous pair of boxers, and more puzzle-focused linear affairs that are tight and clean, like the familiar TWs.  This lets you get the most out of these unique mechanics as you move between trying to literally carve your own path to your objectives and examining your environment to find just the right object to cut or pull so everything falls into place.\n\nIf there's one fault with Tiny and Big, it's that it feels a bit short: five levels and a boss fight.  This might be a bit of a dividing point for some players.  If you just want to cruise to the end of the game in the most efficient way possible, you'll probably be done in a couple hours.  But if you enjoy hunting down tricky secrets and trying to make alternate routes, T + B will occupy you for quite some time.\n\nIf there are two faults, it's that Grandpa's Leftovers contain a few bugs, which, as you can imagine, can make your experience a bit uncomfortable.  None of them are explosively bad, but when you combine them with inevitable physics screw-ups, you'll find yourself losing a little hard-earned progress hunting for the tough secrets or flailing angrily because you've just lost your no-death run of a level.  As I've implied, you won't have a lot of issue with them unless you're going for the optional challenges that add a lot of meat to the game.\n\nYou can get Grandpa's Leftovers for less than the cost of a fresh bag of undies when it goes on sale and I definitely recommend you do.  It's a stand-out game that delivers on all those promises of "fully destructible environments" that almost always prove to be a disappointment.  Most importantly, it's a fun game; fun in the vain of things like Psychonauts.  And that's why you should definitely slip into Grandpa's Leftovers.\n\nThis game certified by inspector no. 28","February 19, 2015","true","15.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","85","33","39","15","0"

Judge me by my size, do you?” -Master YodaTiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers is a relatively short Indie title that follows the story of an individual-with a murmuring voice similar to that of Tom Kenny-named Tiny as he embarks on a journey to seek the only heirloom his late grandfather bestowed upon him: a pair of all-powerful underpants that the main antagonist, Big, obtains. I know how this sounds, and you have every reason to be skeptical because of this description. However, the relentless rivalry between Tiny and Big’s primary protagonist and antagonist-aptly named Tiny and Big-is a very amusing struggle. Tiny is equipped with a radio that seemingly has a mind of its own, as well as a set of three gadgets-rocket attachments, a cutting tool, and a hooked rope- that aide in manipulating the environment.\nHere are just a few reasons to give Tiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers a chance:\n\nGameplay - This title is a physics-heavy game that utilizes the three previously stated tools-each obtained progressively through the game’s story- to allow the environment to be altered, and to, subsequently, allow for progression. Though not all of it is, a large part of the environment is destructible, allowing the player to create varying ways in which to solve puzzles and proceed to the next portion of the game. In fact, so much of this game is able to be manipulated that it is highly possible to discover multiple solutions to a single problem, which adds to the replayability of this relatively short title. The control scheme for this title is quite simple, with the standard W, A, S, and D movement layout providing movement, the Space Bar acting as Tiny’s jump button, and all three of the gadgets being accessible by utilizing the mouse; moving the mouse aims the reticle, LMB activates the cutting tool, MMB allows rockets to be placed on objects-with another click of MMB, once attached, to send the mass flying within the rocket’s trajectory-, and RMB connects the grappling hook to a target. The cutting tool takes a bit of getting used to, but is extremely fun to utilize after a short time of learning.\n\nHumorous Dialogue - Both Tiny and Big share not only a physical rivalry but a verbal one. Speech is erected through text bubbles and is acted out through voices that are jabbering gibberish, but with tones unique to each character. Even Tiny’s radio lends notable dialogue to situations while lending a hand with hints and sounding like someone is constantly changing the station. Combined with its cell-shaded graphics, this game’s approach to conversation is both minimalistic and highly enjoyable.\n\nCollectables and Secrets - You can definitely see the developers’ sense of humor within Tiny and Big’s collectibles system. The most prominent pickups in the game are known as Boring Stones, and pretty much describe how, in general, objects such as these are tossed into games as extra content to add to the replayability; it is quite a silly satire. The developers also have self-inserts hidden within the game which prompt Steam Achievements. There are other secrets  such as hidden game cabinets that take the player to a variation of Tiny and Big that is reminiscent of a retro video game’s color palette but I will allow you to figure out what and where they are throughout the landscape.\n\nTL:DR - I must admit that I was skeptical about purchasing this title due to its completion time, but the overall feel of the game entranced me into reviewing levels I had already cleared just to retain the same sense of prior enjoyment, just to experience this game’s overworld, conversations, secrets, and themes. Admittedly, Tiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers is one of my favorite physics-based adventures, and I have been secretly awaiting a sequel though I know this aspiration is highly unlikely at the given moment.

It's super fun, fluid, and addictive, and what really defines this game.\n\nStory:\n\nThe story is quite simple, Tiny (who you play as) is looking for his Grandpa's white, fine rib underpants - who Big (your arch nemesis) is wearing.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe artstyle in this game is unique and gorgeous, I've never seen a game with a similar artstyle, so I can't give you an example. Watching a video is OK to get an idea of what it's like, but when you're in-game is when the graphics really shine. So yeah, the art is fantastic, but don't expect Crysis 3-esque graphics, the highlight in the graphical department is the artstyle, not textures, lighting or any of that.\n\nAudio:\n\nThe sound effects are satisfying, and are complimented with cartoony "BANG", "SMASH" and "FIZZLE" pop-ups. The soundtrack is fan-f*cking-tastic, you add to the soundtrack by collecting tapes in-game, and they're all (in my opinion) awesome. I would recommend getting the game+soudtrack version, but first search YouTube for some tracks from the game to see if it's your kind of thing.\n\nSome other stuff:\n\nI finished the game in almost 4 hours, but i have nowhere near 100% completion - the game is full with stuff to collect - tapes, and tons of rocks (yeah, you collect these special rocks). So if you take you time to enjoy the game, have fun with the slicing, and make an effort to find secrets (there are secret rooms with easter egg-ish stuff in them), you can probably sink twice the time I did into the game in one playthrough.\n\nAlso, I would say the game deservees a higher score than metacritic's 75, it's a real Indie pearl.\n\nDefinitely recommend!

The title makes it sound like the game is about leftover food, but it's actually about a pair of underwear the player character's, Tiny, grandfather once owned. You see, this pair of underwear is magical, much like Mormon underwear.\n\nI will say though, this was one of the most interesting platformers I've played in a while, mainly because of the amazing physics and cutting edge laser cutting that was wildly accurate when cutting apart statues, rocks, pillars, etc. The devs did a thorough job of making sure the game has its own art style without trying to imitate platformers of the 90's or the early 2000's. The only difference between this platformer and others is there's no hub world. The game is in constant adventure, through 6 different stages of varying atmosphere, difficulty and length.\n\nThe plot is that at the beginning of the game, Tiny gets in a car crash with his radio robot that's trying to guide him, presumably to these pyramids that are seen throughout the game. Well, this other fellow, Big, steals the underwear from the car crash and gains the powers, throwing big rocks and levitaion and what not. Anyway, radio robot helps you along the way while using your tools to fight Big throughout 5 of the 6 stages.\n\nPretty great game overall though, might have benefited from a full soundtrack of orchestra, platformer music, instead of jams and beats.\n\n8.7/10","February 7","true","27.8"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","16","18","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/205910/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Tiny and Big is a rock cutting simulation first a 3D platformer second, both in focus and quality. There are some really cool ideas here to be sure, but the inconsistencies between the various elements makes it a rather uneven experience, and one that is over just as quick as it begins.\n\nDiverging from genre tradition, Black Pants Studios doesn't give you many conveniently placed platforms and instead asks you to make your own using a high powered laser to cut a path through the environment. Physics naturally play a role and make finding the perfect point to slice a rock or beam a largely freeform affair. Unfortunately this also works against the game in many ways do to how easy it is to make a small mistake and have to restart the area (which also resets any collectibles you recently picked up, or cutscenes that played out). On the whole there is simply too little direction, and I found myself getting lost or stuck on numerous occasions.\n\nTiny's unimpressive jump and fickle controls present yet another problem and make navigating the world largely unenjoyable. Movement is jerky and the camera far too slow to compensate, while attempting to cut a rock as it flies through the air (something that happens quite often) typically resulted in me being crushed beneath it as I wrestled to place the cutting line where it needed to be.\n\nArtistically T&B is what I expect the illegitimate offspring of Adventure Time and a Graphic Novel would look like. It's a display of deliberate strangeness and creativity, but unfortunately the muddy textures and poor animations don't do it justice. If the developers got anything right though it is the sound effects, which makes you feel like a boulder lumberjack as the booming crashes threaten to blow out your sub. This was easily the highlight and has me wishing there was simply a mode that allowed me to do nothing but tumble giant rocks, and I daresay would almost make it a game worth playing in and of itself.\n\nWith only six levels which take 15-30 minutes to complete, Tiny and Big falls halfway between an extended demo and a full game. A handful of great moments stand out, but given how short the experience is they hardly justify the price. If not for the poor controls I could see myself recommending it anyway, but for now it's a very hard sell.","October 30, 2013","false","3.6"," 86 of 149 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","86","149","2","0"

You can literally slice through chunks of mountain ridges and columns to create your own pathways, which is encouraged considering how many secrets there are to find. The music is also pretty cool. It's a big mish-mash of artists, similar to how Hotline Miami went about their soundtrack.

It has a quite brilliant game mechanic in that everything can be cut up using a laser tool to provide platforms to reach.\n- Its a different kind of puzzle games in which you have to be creative to reach your goal, it poses practical challenges based around physics.\n- Different every time you die, naturally when you die it means you have to find a different route using the tools provided and it allows a clean slate.\n- Its a fairly simple logic, find the pants. An odd pro for an odd game. Theres pretty much a nonsense no story, its almost as if the gameplay is enough, which it is.\n- Theres a nice style to the game, not exactly pleasing to the eye but it works. Looks almost like sketches.\n- I really liked the idea around finding tapes which changed the music, the music was great too.\n- The end environment was thought provoking and a nice challenge, really loved it.\n\nCONS:\n- Its a shame is so short, about 2.5 hours. It took me about 4 hours to complete as I liked finding stones/tapes, oh and I died a lot.

I didn't fully know what to expect, but after seeing the laser cutting mechanic in the first 10 seconds of the trailer, I was sold on my purchase. This game does not disappoint! All three tool mechanics are widely used in the game in multiple ways, so gameplay never falters, even when replaying. Discovering secrets and extras is exceptionally rewarding, occasionally leading you to decimate entire cliff faces in an attempt to get that one stone down at the bottom and then climb back up again, only downside is saving is checkpoint-based. All in all, I feel that no other game gives the temple-desecration-puzzle elements of this game, and at any price, it's a worthy pickup.

Not even a bit, if you actually take your time and explore all the places and have fun with the mechanics. Surely, 6 levels might seem not enough for a game like this, but they're pretty big and with different ways to complete them, so you'll eventually end up in replaying them. You can create your own level as well, thanks to the modding kit on their site. Pretty fun for speedrunners, as there are leaderboards for every level (and hackers with records such as half a second). The achievements are actually fun and rewarding since they offer a challenge such as complete x level without dying or do this certain thing, without any grinding ones (except the 1000 boring stones one). The soundtrack is one of the best I ever heard (I still have 2-3 songs from this game on my phone even though I last played it 4 months ago): a mix of indie music, sort of electronic trippy 8-bit music, blues and jazz. It's even part of the game itself, letting you collect a music tape for every song giving you the choice to listen to that particular one by choosing it in the menu. The ending left me a bit disappointed, but I guess the devs didn't expect this much success with their game.

I'd called it a physics based puzzle platformer.\n\nThis game is a very short, weird under the radar game that I really enjoyed. You get a laser that can pretty much cut everything in the world into how ever many pieces you want. Though it being a platformer you'll want to take heed on how you cut things because there is a lot of climbing. You'll also get a grappling hook use to pull the pieces around as well a deployable rocket to knock things over and have a bit of fun.\n\nThe game has a very nice art style. Some mix of comic book and paper aesthetic making the material in the world very interesting to interact with. The game is roughly 2 hours long. So depending on your view on the cost/gameplay length debacle I say this errs on the “worth it” side as even though the campaign is rather short.

Although due to the physics, it’s annoying that you could do the exact same cut twice and yet one fails and one works because they both fell differently.\nThere are collectables in the game, which I’ve always liked collectables in games. Gets my OCD gotta-catch-em-all urges going. You collect music tapes that play throughout the game, so the more you find the more music you have to listen to while you play, which is quite cool.  Alongside the tapes there’s boring rocks you can collect, which I think are just exactly what they say on the tin, a boring rock. That does nothing at all.\nAnyways... the music is quite nice, the graphics are pretty and it’s got the whole borderlands, nothing but sand, dirt and rocks, middle of the desert, bare wasteland kind of thing going on. Which, looks nice, it’s decent. But made the game feel a little to bare to me. It wouldn’t hurt to throw in a tree every now and then. I understand that it is supposed to feel like that, which it does really well, I just personally would have enjoyed looking at a little more. You know, jazz that ♥♥♥♥ up a bit.

The title makes it sound like the game is about leftover food, but it's actually about a pair of underwear the player character's, Tiny, grandfather once owned. You see, this pair of underwear is magical, much like Mormon underwear.\n\nI will say though, this was one of the most interesting platformers I've played in a while, mainly because of the amazing physics and cutting edge laser cutting that was wildly accurate when cutting apart statues, rocks, pillars, etc. The devs did a thorough job of making sure the game has its own art style without trying to imitate platformers of the 90's or the early 2000's. The only difference between this platformer and others is there's no hub world. The game is in constant adventure, through 6 different stages of varying atmosphere, difficulty and length.\n\nThe plot is that at the beginning of the game, Tiny gets in a car crash with his radio robot that's trying to guide him, presumably to these pyramids that are seen throughout the game. Well, this other fellow, Big, steals the underwear from the car crash and gains the powers, throwing big rocks and levitaion and what not. Anyway, radio robot helps you along the way while using your tools to fight Big throughout 5 of the 6 stages.\n\nPretty great game overall though, might have benefited from a full soundtrack of orchestra, platformer music, instead of jams and beats.\n\n8.7/10","July 28, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was expecting a relatively generic indie platformer, but what I got was a portal-like physics based puzzle platformer that really got me thinking and being creative.\n\nYou can utilize 3 tools, and I very much like that it gives you all three within the first minute of the game. There is a small tutorial bit explaining some of the things you can do with the tool before the opening scene, but it's very quick, and outside of that the game never really limits which of the 3 you can use.\n\nLeft click activates a slicing mechanic, which locks onto an object, but allows you to strafe around it zelda-style. I would be interested to see what a more point-to-point dragging variation would be like, but the center and drag outwards control works well, and I guess it does allow you to react a tad faster. Right click activates a stiff rope that can be used to pull just about anything. It doesn't retract, but only follows your movement. And finally, Middle Click launches a sticky rocket that will attach to nearly any surface, and a second click will propel the rocket and whatever's attached to it forward.\n\nThe great thing is, that the levels have such a huge sense of scale to them, and these tools can manipulate pieces of stone hundreds or even thousands of times the size of your character. You feel really powerful, and it's awesome when huge walls or pillars come crashing down next to you.\n\nI'd very much recommend a mouse and keyboard. The platforming feels a bit better with a controller, but the speed of the mouse can really add a lot to the experience. You can catch objects mid-air with all 3 of the tools, and manipulate them in ways that require timing just too fast for a controller.\n\nThe game is very mentally stimulating, and there are tons of secrets to find and quicker ways to do things if you really think about the environment and your tools. And that's one of the best features of the game. There's a lot you can interact with, and you can go as far as chopping off the path forward. Don't worry, you can simply respawn at the generous checkpoints, but I just like the fact that it lets you do so much that it can be impossible to progress. It really feels like a genuine adventure, and not just some path that you walk down.\n\nThe visuals have a unique and interesting style, although the fidelity isn't amazing, especially the texture resolution. The soundtrack also feels very unique, and while I didn't love all of it, there were a few songs that I really enjoyed, even more so because the music tracks are actually hidden collectables. I found all but 3 on my playthrough. There's so little dialog that I think it could really benefit from voice acting, and it would be quick and easy to get done. Your radio  has a personality and talks to you, but it's easy to miss much of what he says because it's just a text bubble on the bottom of the screen.\n\nPerformance wise it should be very easy to run. It runs extremely well, and does support 120Hz. There's no FOV adjustment, and while wasn't the 100-110 I'm used to, it was definitely high enough to not cause any issues for someone like me who sits pretty close to my display.\n\nChances are you probably already own this game from a bundle so go ahead and play through it! It's not a long game, and even though I would have liked more, it's a concise and genuinely enjoyable experience. There's a lot of creativity both on the part of the developers, and on yourself and how you play because of how open it is. And if you don't already have it, you can pick it up for $2 on sales or less if you trade for bundle key. I completely recommend it for everyone but small children, only because of the thinking and platforming skill required to progress.","June 24, 2014","true","4.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

TL;DR version below.\n\nYou control Tiny going after Big who stole his pants and he wants them back. With you have the Radio and some tools that cut, rocket and pull rocks and mountains apart. It's a platformer where you can create your own paths and destroy almost everything in the levels for fun, or for exploration. Some fun pysichics and mechanics, when you stand below a mountain and cutting it off, just to see this movie like seen where the mountain falls over you, trying to run away from it. It looks great. You find your own music, which is a fun mechanic, they are not hard to find, so don't worry. And the soundtrack fits and gives that little extra feeling to it. The stages can be a little to linear and you can't redo cuts, this can be a little trick, let's say you cut a bridge you need to cut, and the checkpoint first comes when it's cut, then you have to restart the entire map. But the stages are interesting and fun to maim about, and still a lot of secret things to discover here and there. Though even well designed stages, there is only one way to reach the goal. In a game with mechanics like this, where you cut your own way through mountains, there should be multiple ways to reach it. There is, but not to that extend it was intended and you go through hell if you mess up and try to make another piece of mountain fit has a bridge.\n\nThe game is done comic book like, with textbubbles and grunting for speech. It has humor and done well. I don't think I have much more to say about that... Oh, the game also needs workshop, this game has so much potential for that.\n\nWhat is also good about this game, is does something more games should do. The game is enjoyable at all times, nothing in it seems like a chore, at least not to me. The puzzles could be a tad irritating in a good way (You know, the way you just need to do this and the satisfaction when you suceed). Even the tidious tasks as collecting boring stones, opens up for exploration and secrets. This game makes you want to explore, destroy that mountain and see what's behind it. So it's a huge shame that the maps were as linear as they were and short.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPROS:\nExploration and destruction of everything\nGood humor\nGreat Soundtrack\nFun psychics and fun to play around\nWell made stages that are fun and challenging to play\nNothing seems like a chore\n\nCONS:\nI bit tad short\nMaps are a bit linear for what the game offers\nCan't create to many of your own paths to progress\nNo workshop :(\n\nConclusion: A really enjoyable game. Even though you can complete the game 100% in 13, it's a really fun, enjoyable way to spend 13 hours. So for 10 euro, this game rocks. I am hoping for workshop and or a sequel that is even more ambitious. If you like platformer and exploration, this game is for you.","July 12, 2014","true","15.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

It's too short. Now I wasn't dissatisfied with the game, I wanted there to be more; more blocks to slice, more sliced blocks to pull, more pulled sliced blocks to rocket thrust, more wide open areas with simple yet engaging scenery, but as I said before content quantity is this game's shortcoming.\n\nBut fortunately this brings me to positive points.\n\nWhat this game is is a large scale 3D platformer in which the goal is to go from point A to point B through the manipulation of large chunks of stone to work your way through very large areas (primarily ancient ruins) full of platforms, bridges, pits, tunnels, secrets rooms, the whole lot. Utilizing your three tools effectively provides a wide palette of techniques to progress through each level: whether you create a bridge to reach another platform, or create a ramp down to a platform with potentially more resources, or maybe you're like me and you decide to strap a rocket to the back of a stone slab and surf your way to your goal. But the point is nothing is set in stone (everything is stone hah get it) here, you make your way to the magic pants in whichever way pleases the tastes of your inner mason.\n\nThe story, while short, is both simple and goofy as well. Take that as you wish, but unless you have a fetish for black briefs and have a lifelong feud with your brother, the story is a meaningless accessory to what is actually fun gameplay.\n\nSo in summary yes, I like the game and I'd pay 99 cents for the game again, full price however, no.","July 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/recommended/205910/","Desenova","Desenova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Desenova/","319 products in account","Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers is a quirky little game I received through a Humble Bundle Indie Games bundle and it sat on my "To play" list for some time. Like many things involving Steam and the Humble Bundle, your games library can increase almost exponentially and like many others, this game was buried until a song from the soundtrack came on while I was driving home one day and I immediately put the whole album on and listened to it, especially the highly catchy track, Little Pretty Thing by 3typen featuring Bryan Kessler. I also logged onto my mobile Steam app and began downloading the game remotely (How many people forgot that you can do that?). Developed and Published by Black Pants Game Studio.\n\n\nGameplay: 86/100 B\nThe basics is all that exists here, in the world of Tiny and Big, with three added mechanics, a grappling hook to pull stones and statues around, a rocket gun to push stones and statues out of the way, and the main "weapon" of choice - a laser powered stone cutter. A majority of the game involves literally cutting your way through levels of stone in order to get to the next part of the stage mixed in with some platforming, that can be a little frustrating as your character, Tiny, does feel just a tad loose in the controls, but nothing a little adaptation can't fix. The niche mechanics are really nice for a good portion of the game, planning ahead in some cases as you try to figure out if you cut a platform, will fall in the direction you plan and land where you want it to. It can be really satisfying to watch a pillar fall and come crashing down to form a bridge for you to cross, makes you want to yell "TIMBER!" every time it happens. Unfortunately, at least for me, the charm wore off around 3/4ths of the way and I found myself just wildly cutting away, creating a pile of rubble to climb upon instead of a carefully crafted structure, but there is a deterrent to this strategy - wildly cutting around may inadvertently remove the support structure of something next to or above you and, much like [SPOILER WARNING] Clayton madly slicing away at vines in the climax of Disney's Tarzan, it will most likely become your downfall. That said, it's probably best to be careful when cutting away at a wall, because almost everything you can see is able to be cut by your laser tool.\n\n\nStory: 83/100 B-\nThe story of Tiny and Big is silly at best, but I don't mean that in a bad way. It's charming and even cute at times, but make no mistake, it's not for children. The occasional curse word will remind you of the target audience. The basic premise of the story revolves around Big taking Tiny's underpants. Though there isn't really anything in terms or talking, it is all text driven, much like a comic book in motion. There's even "Bam," "Fizzle," and "Boom" word effects when stones crash to the ground ala Adam West Batman, further adding to type of story the game is presenting. It's simple, starts in the middle, and ends in the middle. It is not a plot meant to be taken in anything, just as it is and with that, it delivers. It's not crude, but it's also not classy. It's almost like a toned down Borderlands.\n\n\nAudio: 95/100 A\nThe music of Tiny and Big is broken into two parts: there's the ambient game music and then there's the "Buckets full of Indie Music" to be collected and found by "hardly known, but genuine indie bands." While it may sound like a disingenuous advertisement for the music, a little tongue and cheek has to be taken, since the game itself doesn't take itself too seriously as well. The gameplay music is composed masterfully, invoking emotion and matches the environments perfectly, much in the same way Borderlands did, but much like Borderlands, Tiny and Big makes you long for something more as you gaze out into the horizon. At times, the soothing music makes you want to just wander off to see what's out there instead of fulfilling your mission.\n\n\nVisuals: 93/100 A-\nMuch like the music, the art direction mirrors that of Borderlands, the heavy black lines and vibrant color schemes makes it stand out and is very easy on the eyes, a welcomed break from the bleak gray and brown color schemes that is so overused in video games these days. As mentioned before, Tiny and Big even has "caption" effects like "Crash," Splat," and "Pow" and adds to the effect in a charming way, although there was more than one instance when the words got in the way of a pillar falling in my direction and couldn't see it. Not really a problem, but it did make me slap my forehead on occasion. The design of the game is also very consistent, even though you only get to explore a small portion of the world you're on, you are given a fairly good idea of what it's like. That kind of direction, not just in art styles, is what builds a fan base and community, and with that, often sequels and support.\n\n\nContent: 75/100 C\nLike most indie games, they are designed to be taken in small doses, played as a relaxant or in between major sessions and Tiny and Big is no exception. One could easily finish the game in an hour or two if they wanted. There is a motive to explore, finding hidden items, mini-games, and music tracks and despite the general length of the game, exploring is often worth it in this case. Finding the mini-games especially was fun, going into a hidden room behind a wall or turning a corner to find an old coin operated arcade machine is a pleasant surprise.\n\n\nDesign: 88/100 B+\nLike I stated in the Visual aspect of the game, everything is consistently designed, from the characters, to the tools, to the environment, definite thought was taken into account and not just tossed together based on someone's cool concept art.\n\n\nVerdict: 87/100 B+\nTiny and Big is a nice little distraction and a wonderful first game by Black Pants from the choice of music to the art direction. It is another sign that the indie market still has a lot to offer which the AAA market won't risk or toy with. Goofy story telling, basic mechanics and a swagger of being just itself gives it enough of a push to be shared and recommended to all your friends. Yes, it does have some problems, but like with many indie releases, the ideas and games overshadow the flaws, something AAA can't seem to get right, especially when the flaws are so simplistic, makes you wonder how they ever went unnoticed.","August 19, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You won't be able to resist the witty commentary that makes the game all the more enjoyable to play.\nI also really enjoyed the fact that you could, indeed, go wrong. This game makes you think twice about what you're going to do next and you might actually have to take a second to think about your moves.

This might be the game for you.   The gameplay mechanic is the real star here.  Unfortunately the carving/cutting/pulling mechanic outshines the rest of the game itself, but that doesn't detract much from the overall fun.  There's no single solution to problem solving here which is refreshing and it leads to a lot of out the box thinking.  There's also a  ton of hidden things to find.  Still, there's nothing more fun than turning a boulder into a Jenga tower and pulling it apart.","December 6, 2014","true","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The art style is superb, I never tired of the 3D, comic book-esque, sound effects popping up and the cel shaded graphics works well. The mechanics are unique and solid. You can interact with way more of the environment than necessary to complete the tasks which leads to quite a bit of goofing off, tearing things down and blasting them around. The story actually ends up having a bit of depth once you get through a few slow bits in the middle. Given how this game was developed and published it is unsurprising to see a few issues, like some occasional control bugs, but all the things it does right gloss them over. I can certainly recommend this game but I would caution against buying the soundtrack until you've heard the music.","January 6, 2014","true","6.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Cutting up stuff with lasers is quite fun and constructing your own walkways and platforms from debris is neat.\n\nHowever once boss fights come into play the entire game falls apart as you're grappling with subpar controls while trying to aim your gadgets and wait ♥♥♥♥, just fell down a pit/gap because nearly everything coming at you does so from above. The idea is good; cut projectiles coming at you! But when the windows for movement and progression are minute it becomes quite frustrating and you begin to rely on finding blind spots where you can carry out your tasks without being pummelled.\n\nTiny & Big is worth a look at, and the first hour is pretty fun to mess about with but I wouldn't go out of your way to get this game. It's incredibly short and finding all of the collectibles is intended for the incredibly patient and/or autistic.","July 18, 2014","false","4.1"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","0"

The central game mechanic is fantastic, as well as the sound track and art style. This is a game worthy of a sequel, the mechanics could be fleshed out so much more! I found myself having a childish nostalgic feeling when palying this game, reminding me of the days I spent playing through Ratchet and Clank the first time.

It's fine. Super fine. Like, "Iron man after he just got out of the car wash to find himself with a glass of wine and a red velvet chair to sit in next to a waterfall of sweet, citrus orange juice." But why so fine? Why all the great praise, you fine banana? Well I'll tell you: It's a game about you destroying everything in your wake in order to track down a man for revenge after he panty raided your grandpa. That's part of the game, practically everything is destructable, and by cutting all these things up with a laser you use them as platforms. Believe me when I say it's much more fun than it sounds.\n\nExample: I screwed up and accidentally dropped the block that was obviously placed to help me get across a gap into an abyss. Normally in a game, that's a restart. This one? Nope. I took down a piece of the cieling of the temple thing I was on and brought it crashing down.\n\nThe puzzle solving is super open-ended like that and it makes it really fun and the puzzle-challenge goes from finding the solution to actually GETTING your solution to work. Besides, cutting ♥♥♥♥ up with a laser in large-scale destruction is just plain fun.\nThe unique art styling and music of pure funk helps too.\n\nLittle edit: I just want to add that you can beat the whole thing in three hours. You can double that if you go back and try to get the better scores and find all the secrets/collectables, but I figured it's important to note the length some of you may find...

Made by a very small team, I knew it wasn't going to be a long game, but what I didn't know was how much fun it would be. There's something to be said about the fun one can have being able to slice and dice nearly every visible object in the world. Thanks to this very addictive mechanic, creating your own path to the objective is both fun and challenging. Not only that, but an entire "cuttable" world gives great possiblity for the existance of secret paths and items, of which there are a plenty.\n\nThe graphics are reminiscent of Borderlands but have a certain original quality. Gameplay is fairly straightforward and simple; along with standard platforming, players are to able cut, push, grapple, and attach rockets to objects. The music is varied and enjoyable, ranging from a jazzy trombone quarted to electric music to spanish drums and guitar; it's very rare I actually stop playing a game to sit and listen to the music.\n\nWith every good there must come the bad, but thankfully there aren't that many here. With more funding, perhaps the game could have been longer, as well as had more challenging levels. Being that it is such a short game, the devs have put in the all too common completionist achievements such as collecting every single "boring rock" in every single level. Not something that appeals to me, but perhaps other people would enjoy it. The controls are a bit sensitive, to the point where I've fallen off ledges when simply tapping a key to turn a certain direction. The last gripe I have is with the title. Only once you have played through the game do you understand why it is titled as such. Whether this is an attempt at being deep or creative, it falls short of achieving this goal and only serves to give the impression the devs were throwing darts to pick a name.\n\nOther than these few, small complaints, Tiny and Big has a real charm to it; definitely worth a playthrough.

The Entire game consists of cutting stones, pulling stones, and pushing stones with rockets, it may sound very simple but the simplicity is what makes this game quite fun. You are dropped in a world where you have your objective to retrieve these special pants and you know that you need to get them so you use your tools to create your own pathways to progress. The game play is fun and new in comparison to most Indie games today, the soundtrack is just phenomenal, and the art style is just fun and new. this game is worth every cent and i highly recommend it to any gaming enthusiast who is itching to try something new and fun that they wont forget anytime soon.\n\nPros about this game\n-Great and new fun that has never been done before\n-Awesome soudtrack and art with a decent amount of replayability\n-Reasonable Price\n\nCons about this game\n- Sadly it is a short game\n- No workshop support\n- Modding and level creation are allowed at the games main website but are not supported over steam\n- Replayability is based solely on individuals who strive to complete all the challenges.\n\nI give this game a 7.75/10 Its such a fun game, but the lack of community support and replayability is what really hurts this great game.\nRegardless i encourage anyone who takes an interest in this game to buy it","July 14, 2014","true","15.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Now about the game itself:\n\nIt's a nifty little physics-based puzzle platform that actually has a really awesome core mechanic: The ability to slice and dice objects and then manipulate them with a grappling hook or a high-powered rocket. It's incredible fun, intuitive, and innovative. The graphics and aesthetics of the game are incredible as well, with tons and tons of work put into to giving the game a non-realistic, but consistent look. It also has a small set  of very interesting indie tracks to go along with the dry visuals of the desert.\n\nHowever there are two somewhat major negatives, one of which has to do with why I said what I said in that very first sentence of this recommendation:\nFirst, the game is very short, two hours is about the average playtime required to beat it if you look around a bit here and there for secrets, and second, I must've seriously missed something, because the "BIG CHARACTER" promised on the Steam store and GreenManGaming pages is not there at all. As much as I don't want to say this, I did not laugh a single time at any of the dialogue and the characters not much more more than text-spouting heads and plot devices.\n\nAll in all, a great little puzzle game to get if you can find a deal on it somewhere as long as you like the overall audio-visual style and don't expect or want Portal-like humor and character.","June 5, 2013","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though the game will take, at most, a few hours to be completed, you won't really mind once you realise just how much fun you can have slicing at the environment and playing around with the physics. The intentionally sketchy cel-shaded comic strip artstyle isn't bad on the eyes either, with practically every scene of the game suffused with vibrant colour that brings to mind a graphic novel. The soundtrack, drawn from a variety of bands both eclectic in nature and independant in mode, is notably unique, while still being catchy and fitting the game itself perfectly. There are a number of collectables and challenges for completionists to work with. In short, it's an unknown gem, a perfect example of what makes an indie game good.\n\nBesides, how many games revolve around recovering a pair of supernatural underwear?","June 22, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fun to navigate the levels of the 3 hour game since they all feel stylish, the music fits, the characters are interesting, and you actually have to logic your way through increasingly difficult areas. There are lots of secret areas you might discover, but they never really made sense until the last level. (Which I guess is somewhat a good thing, but when you keep finding things supposedly important but no idea what they're good for, it's a bit silly). Because the game heavily relies on physics there are some annoying bugs that arise in certain situations, and the game crashed on me a few times which I shouldn't have to say is pretty annoying. 8/10","March 30, 2013","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Big stole your Grandpa's pants, so you have to get them back. Simple right? Well, not quite. Big got a super power from the pants and he wants to destroy the world...\n\nPros:\n-Very unique gameplay, I liked the laser mechanic a lot!\n-Simple graphics which fit the game's atmosphere.\n-Not bad soundtrack.\n-Secret places (I felt like a god, when I found some of these... :DD)\n\nCons:\n-There's some parts in the game that has a cutscene before it. These cutscenes cannot be skipped... I watched one half minute long cutsene at least 10 times because there's a very hard boss fight after it.\n-Sometimes can be very hard, but overall, this game is too easy in my opinion.\n-You can collect "Boring Stones" in the game and I found a place where it's almost impossible to get them... You have to be very lucky to get some of these. So if you want to get 100% of the achevements, then prepare for these little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...\n\nOverall:\nI enjoyed the game, it was really unique and sometimes funny.

It's fine. Super fine. Like, "Iron man after he just got out of the car wash to find himself with a glass of wine and a red velvet chair to sit in next to a waterfall of sweet, citrus orange juice." But why so fine? Why all the great praise, you fine banana? Well I'll tell you: It's a game about you destroying everything in your wake in order to track down a man for revenge after he panty raided your grandpa. That's part of the game, practically everything is destructable, and by cutting all these things up with a laser you use them as platforms. Believe me when I say it's much more fun than it sounds.\n\nExample: I screwed up and accidentally dropped the block that was obviously placed to help me get across a gap into an abyss. Normally in a game, that's a restart. This one? Nope. I took down a piece of the cieling of the temple thing I was on and brought it crashing down.\n\nThe puzzle solving is super open-ended like that and it makes it really fun and the puzzle-challenge goes from finding the solution to actually GETTING your solution to work. Besides, cutting ♥♥♥♥ up with a laser in large-scale destruction is just plain fun.\nThe unique art styling and music of pure funk helps too.\n\nLittle edit: I just want to add that you can beat the whole thing in three hours. You can double that if you go back and try to get the better scores and find all the secrets/collectables, but I figured it's important to note the length some of you may find...

It is right up there with psychonauts, except it's got more focus on puzzle solving.\n\nYou can expect to die a lot on your first time through.   Some people will like this aspect, others won't.   However, it is very typical of platformers.  Fortunately they don't have the archaic lives cap that some games still have.  This the constant dieing less of a problem, and more of a challenge.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the game is that it is designed in such a way that there is often more than one way to do things, even though there is usually at least one fairly obvious way.\n\nAnother thing many players will love is the sheer level of collectables and hidden places in the game.   You may get through the game quite qickly on your first run, but it will take a long time to find everything.\n\nThere is a trial mode for perfectionists where you can perfect the level in various ways: speed, rockets used, cuts used, collectables gotten.  This adds significant replay value, and is something more games need.  I find it unfortunate that you have to finish the game to unlock time trial mode.   This is probably the only thing I don't like about the feature.\n\nFor Linux users, the Linux port works excellent, and is a full port of the engine, not a simple wrapper.  It laregely uses Open Source libraries, which many Linux users will find as a plus.\n","October 31, 2014","true","10.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Slice, pull, and push pretty much anything you like to your heart's content; just be careful not to smush yourself.\n\nThis game has an art style unlike any I've seen in a game before, and it just works so well.  Everything about this game is stylish.  The soundtrack is a varied collection of multi-genre tunes from a bunch of bands I've never heard of before which suits the game perfectly, and the overall presentation throughout the game is excellent.  The story is silly, and light (although it gets darker towards the end), but the game still does a nice job of building up to the final confrontation.\n\nFans of platformers and physics games: you are doing yourself a disservice if you have not played this.","July 17, 2013","true","3.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/205910/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Tiny and Big: Grandpa’s Leftovers is a fairly short game like the original Portal. The core of the game lies within its unique and satisfying puzzle platformer gameplay, along with an eclectic soundtrack and a hand drawn art style to bring it together for a fun game about cutting rocks and finding your grandpa’s pants. The premise of the game might be strange, but it’s the style that this game oozes that adds to the destruction gameplay in many good ways.\n\nThe story does need some short explanation since looking at it, it does sound very strange. Grandpa’s pants were stolen by a man named Big, and it’s up to Tiny to get the pants back. In addition there is The Radio which acts as Tiny’s sidekick in his adventure to retrieve the pants. It’s a simple story, and the game tells the story using cutscenes and dialog boxes. There is quite a lot of small dialogue in the game which tends to add to the humorous nature of the story, ranging from the main dialogue of the story to shorter lines for finding some of the secrets in the world. Tiny and Big does the humor in a good way with some funny situations and lines between the characters, and of course has the strange story as the vehicle for the comedy.\n\nTiny and Big is a third person physics puzzle platformer, but with a focus on destructing the environment to navigate to the end of each level. Tiny has at his disposal a laser, a grappling rope, and attachable rockets in his set of tools. The grappling rope allows for pulling objects and the rockets allow pushing debris out of the way. Tiny can also push any object by walking into them with more control than the other methods. The laser is the most interesting and exciting part of the game, since it allows cutting of objects with any angle. Cutting things is seamless, all it takes is the length and angle and the game presents the cut object complete with physics. It’s a marvel at how seamless the cutting process is and the robust physics engine is with the cut objects. After a while, cutting becomes intuitive with choosing how to slice things to get across a gap along with using the other tools to position objects into place. The levels in Tiny and Big are quite linear, using the physics puzzles as ways to navigate over gaps and obstacles. The general platforming is not the most robust however. It can be tricky to judge how far a jump can go, and there are times when walking up a slope and moving forward, you actually move to the side and might fall off. Still, these are minor with the amount of checkpoints and the relatively short and linear levels. Of note, the game does have many achievements and secrets, so it does encourage exploration and might make the game longer than 3-4 hours if you do some exploration. Overall, the rock cutting gameplay is fantastic, with the simple levels and straightforward platforming encouraging a good use of the physics puzzles.\n\nWhile the game does excel at the unique physics gameplay, it also has some great style too. The game is presented in 3D for the physics engine to do its work, but the art style is something different. The textures look hand drawn and cartoony, which matches the somewhat strange story perfectly. Some sound effects are accompanied by visual text, much like a comic book. It’s quite a different style from most games, but the hand drawn cartoony textures works great for the story and adds to it in good ways.\n\nThe soundtrack for this game is excellent, as it also acts a great fit for this game. The music is comprised of songs by several indie bands and wasn’t made for Tiny and Big, but boy do the songs sound great. Most of the songs are some funky beats, so trying to cut apart the landscape is more interesting with it. Again, the overall music style does fit nicely with the story, so it’s a nice touch and makes for a good listen.\n\nTiny and Big places some fun physics puzzle platforming with the ability to cut rocks in any shape and angle you want, and it also has some great style and story for a fun experience. Most of the game is cutting rocks and using physics to get to the end of the level which is immensely fun, but the art, music, and story also plays a role in making a unique experience. With some pretty simple and straightforward levels and mechanics, Tiny and Big puts fun physics gameplay along with strange story and style for a solid game about rocks and pants.","March 13","true","5.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

I never hit any bugs, but i did get fustrated because there is one part where big hovers a giant boulder over your head and just drops it. Gameplay wise i would say it does a good job of being a physics game, not so much on the parkour bit though. You can tell this game is trying to be hard core parkour, but when you can pull down a support beam and use it as a make shift bridge, there isn't much parkour. The art style is actually kind of simple but when a physics game is based off getting a pair of pants, a simple art style is for the best. The only thing that bothered me is the goal, you are after a pair of "pants" but it is underware. It's almost like black pants had a miscomunication with it's dialoug team. Other than that i have no problems with the game, so on my end i give a 10/10.","June 18, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There any many problems which keep this game from a higher score. The good involves an interesting and inventive mechanic and usually good physics system. The bads involve many things. The platforming is pooly done as the jumping doesn't feel right because right when your guy gets in the air he starts falling at a disproportionate rate for some reason. This makes jumping annoying and hard to judge. The physics can sometimes be wonky as I have pulled something and then it goes flying away for a reason. The game has a lot of trial and error/luck. You cut a block and for some reason it doesn't fall the way you want to, so you start the point over and keep trying till it does. The cutting mechanics usually work well but some things like cutting out an overhead block make no sense, as you can cut it in half length-wise and it won't fall down to you, you have to cut it vertically too for some reason. The game is pretty short as well. The story is basically non-existant as you have to get pants from some guy, and that is literally it. The game likes to make jokes about pants/underpants and it gets old after the first 5 min but they keep going which it, which just makes it more annoying and less funny, if that was even possible. The final boss was the most poorly done. You couldn't cut a block right in front of you, for no apparent reason. Also, the blue indicator which shows you can cut something no longer works when cutting the blocks he throws at you. I spent 10 min trying to cut blocks that should have worked but the game mechanics couldn't support me doing the right thing, and you have to keep starting from the beginning. One of the worst boss fights I can remember because it is soo poorly done. It is fun in the game improving and making your own way to get to somewhere, if only mechanics and things were done better.

Then, it's about discovery and exploration, which this game certainly encourages!\n\nThe story is a bit silly, but if you look past it, it will reveal a deeper story of power and civilization. It's put very simply, and it's clearly not something you should obcess over, but it's nice that it's there, and it adds a bit of depth to an otherwise very silly game! (Don't worry, it's still very silly as it is!)\n\n\nYou play as Tiny, and you're off to collect the only thing your late Grandpa has left you: a pair of pants. Why pants? Hell if you know. But it's the last thing he has collected, as a spelunker, so it should be worth it.\nAnd you're off, into a very empty desert. Then you have an accident, and you'll soon discover a new world in that seemingly empty desert. It's you and your radio on a mighty quest! For... pants.\n\n\n\nPresentation wise, the game is simple, but it has its own style. I reminded me a bit of Psychonauts, which I know is a plus for many people.\n\nEverything seems hand-drawn (even the textures). Everything seems rough, but it fits the whole style of the game, in my opinion.\nThen, each time something falls, it'll make a noise, and will also drop a big "BAMM" or... "SMURTLES", in addition to the sound effect. It's nice, it's a cool little detail.\nAnother cool aspect I really enjoyed, was the little hints present in the world regarding its civilization and its lore. It goes a long way into making a world very enjoyable to explore, and feel lively rather than empty.\nThere are also secret levels that place you inside an old gameboy, with graphics to match. Only in 3D!\nOverall, everything has a very unique feel to it, it's pretty good.\n\n\nThe music was also really good! It's hard to classify it, but it fits the barren wasteland where you are. Since you're on a journey with your radio, the music isn't necessarily continuous. You're free to switch tracks around with a single key, and just listen to the tracks you want.\nI usually prefer the music to be tailored to the situations, but as the sandbox game that this is (mostly), I think that it works better in this way.\n\nAlong with it, sound design is also very good.  Since you're mostly cutting huge stones, everything will soon start to break, with a big impact. Both the sound effects and a small screen shake will give you the impression that the world is literally falling apart around you. I may or may not have tried to dodge rocks myself from my comfortable chair. Immersion is a strongpoint in this game!\n\n\nNow, how is gameplay?\nWell, it's the shining point of Tiny and Big!\n\nAs I said, the mechanics are very simple. You have a laser, with which you cut the environment. You have what it essentially a grappling hook, to pull objects towards you. And you have a rocket, that you attach to things, and send them flying.\n\nAnd with these 3 bad boys, you can do anything, really.\nThere are 6 levels (one of which is a Boss Fights) only, but you can easily sink at least one hour into each, in your first palythrough (and you're likely to miss secrets, which are worthy going back for).\n\nThe scale of the game is awesome, with very open areas, generally, and lots of places to reach. Of course, you can't just climb stairs... if you want, you'll have to make them. You'll cut pillars, mountains, doors, ... you name it. Chances are, if you can see it, you can reach it! Somehow.\n\nFinishing the level isn't really the point here. Than can be done very quickly, and very easily. And all things considered, it won't be worth it. But, the game has a bunch of secrets areas to explore, and a few collectibles, if you're in for achievements. There are also or challenges, if you want to limit your toolkit.\n\nIf you're into more sandbox-y and exploration games, definitely give this one a try!\nYou'll find yourself trying to climb everything, cut the world in two (or, you know... in 50), looking under every rock (well, mountain)... you get the drill.\n\n\nOne very good thing, is that the game never really punishes exploration, at all! Once you reach somewhere important, the game will auto-save. That way, even if you die, you can just get back to it. It's a very good thing!\nThere are God figures to find, rocks to collect (just for the achievements, generally, and also encouraging exploration even more), there are Music Tapes, to add to your collection and there are also Arcades! Each arcade is essentially a "challenge" level. Some of them were very easy and straightforward, others were slightly more challenging. It's just a nice addition to the game.\nThere are also Easter Eggs spread around the world. The room where the band made the game's music, for example, with posters referencing other games, and the such. These are certainly nice to find.\n\nThe achievements, weirdly enough, are also a good thing, in this case. The developers knew that the game was all about exploration, trying different strategies, challenging yourself, and as such, they've implemented achievements accordingly. All of them were made to encourage you to explore, rather than just try to finish it. And it's a good thing, it's nice to see it for a change!\n\n\nOne issue that I have with the game, is the dialogue. Not because it's bad, but because of the way it was presented. In the cutscenes, everything was fine, and it made me grin a little. During gameplay, however, it has a big problem. In order not to obstruct the player's vision, they've kept the dialogue in the corners. The problem with it, is that you're very, very likely to miss it, amidst the chaos. The whole world is falling on you, so it's understandable you'll miss the little dialogue in your peripheral vision.\nIt's not a deal breaker, at all, but it's still a flaw, I'd say.\n\nAnother thing, is that the game is quite short, if you're into repeating levels, which I can understand. 5 levels is a bit short (I'm not counting the Boss Fight), even if they are varied. I've spend from 40 minutes to 1 hour in each level, roughly, by trying to explore as much as possible. I still missed a couple of things, which I'm likely to go back to, but you may not be.\n\n\nBut, all things considered, Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers is a genuinely great game! I hadn't felt as immersed in a game as I have with it, in a while, and that's all due to the freedom it gives you.\nIt's like a puzzle-platformer, without the genre's main flaw, for most people, which is that the solution are somewhat limited. Some people don't like those kinds of games, simply because there are very limited solutions to those problem. Well, that's not the case with this game. There are countless ways of traversing the map, all equally fun and valid!\nYou'll just lose yourself in each level, experimenting with each rock, cutting and pulling, trying to reach something that looks interesting.\nGive this one a try, it's definitely worth your time!","June 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Got amazing (and hidden) Minigames and very nice challenges aswell. Everything you do is permanent, what means all must be done with much care and logical thinking...sometimes you don't got much time to think and/or take much care...since this game got some action in it too!

You can accidentally cut bridges you need to cross. Its amazing.\n\nThe story, if anyone cares (I don't), is standard "quirky" indie game-type story. This time about a family heirloom, underpants which grant the wearer superpowers. I never care about story in games, and thus its the gameplay that attracts me, and this game's freeform destruction is very unique in a gaming world of invisible walls and chest high barriers you cant climb over.\n\nGet it!

And I couldn't get out from the same spot where I just entered. The crack seemed a lot narrower when I got inside. I tried pushing and pulling, and the rockets, none of them worked.\n\nThought it was a glitch but really didn't want to restart, because I had spent over 20 minutes exploring and cutting like a madman.\n\nI could see the outside a bit from the vertical crack. I saw the place where I was running and cutting like a crazy ape from stone age who just travelled into the 22th centuary.\n\nI just wanted to get out of there.\n\nAfter searching and exploring, I managed to find a spot where I could cover a small part of the rock with my laser cutter.\nPiece by piece I cut, but I was too hasty to cut it finer. So the blocks piled up on the top and no way I could correct it since there was only a narrow passage where I could stand.\n\nEventually the rocks started to crack in a nasty way. Everything went a little bizzare. It sounded just like a horrible earthquake.\nBut I caught a chance so I quickly cut out a small exit, and ran out of the chaos where rocks falling from high, dust and sand everywhere--I couldn't see ♥♥♥♥.\nAnd right after I crawled my way out, everything fell apart and down on the ground.\n\nI was lucky enough to make it.

Tiny and Big has a good visual style going for it and some nice ambient music, and the environmental destruction mechanic is great. Unfortunately, out of the 6 short levels in the game, only one actually comes close to reaching that mechanic's full potential of letting you find bizarre solutions with haphazard cuts to huge, towering walls and rocks. All the other levels are more about being delicate or making very few cuts in very precise places. The game is just too reserved for its destruction mechanic, and with only one level in an already short game taking advantage of it, it's not worth paying full price.

On paper it would sound great but games are not played on paper. The game also serves as a good example as to why publishers can be a good thing. I think that with additional play testing and someone higher up to reign in the focus a little, Tiny & Big could have been another entry into the growing list of awesome indie games. As is, it's a game with solid base but one that fails to do anything with it. Likewise, this game is like any other 3D puzzle platformer. The graphics are pretty cool, but that's not what most people play games for. The puzzles are repetitive and dull, and don't ever seem to use Tiny's arsenal to its full extent. The controls are awkward and almost broken, and it is riddled with glitches. All in all I bought it on sale for 99 cents instead of $9.99.

All three are used to manipulate the stony environment that you jump, push, pull and roam around in. This game is essentially a platformer where you create and modify the platforms. While this idea in itself is enough to keep me interested, it’s the game’s style which really captivated me. Tiny and Big is a 3D, third-person platformer with a simple and slightly under-developed cell-shaded graphical style. And by simple and under-developed, I don’t mean anything negative as it only adds to the graphical style of the game. Like no-one having noses… odd. Even the menu displays look like they’ve been sketched.\n\nDo you know what’s more irritating than a game that keeps crashing? A good game that keeps crashing. I am very much in two minds about my time spent playing this game.

I totally would like it and recommend for unusual creative ideas behind mechanics and funny story, but only for me actual gameplay seems boring. You just walk / jump around while cutting and pulling the rock parts here and there.. Maybe I didn't play enough to find real challenge? There is no dynamics around you except static lifeless desert.\n\n+ Game colors, design. It's great.\n+ Smart mechanics based on physics.\n+ Also I like the music.\n\n- First half an hour you enjoy, after, playing seems repetitive and kind of tiresome. The main reason of that - there is no life in the game, except maybe big and gophers, but smashing last is not challenging at all. And don't listen to people, who compare this game with Portal.","May 3","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tails86/recommended/205910/","Tails86","Wiikly Reviews","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tails86/","391 products in account","I have been looking at this game for a while and always was concerned about purchasing it. If your an indie gamer supporter and are wondering if this game is good Well here is what I think.\n\nFirst of all for a Indie Game this game is amazing to look at. Everything from the actual character models to the backgrounds to even seeing stuff in the distance is pretty awesome. The Game uses Celshaded visuals much like games such as No More Heroes, Legend of Zelda Windwaker, and Borderlands 2.\n\nMovement is solid whether your using Keyboard & Mouse or using a Controller and feels spot on. Jumping, Using your hook,  & rockets  are very simplified. You can take all the time you need as you start off in tutorials which the game very easily walks you through to get a feel of the game.\n\nThe Story is you are The Loser Tiny chasing after your nemesis & Thief Big who stole your Under pants and finds that they have Hidden Powers. (No do not go putting your Under Pants IRL on your head cause they dont have any of this kind of Power sadly D:)\n\nThe worlds are all very big and vast and you can practically do anything you wish in the game. You can roam around and look for boring stones or you can go use your rockets or hook to pull on blocks that you cut with your laser. The Entire area you roam around in Can be cut and used to help you. (up to about 95% of everything your near Minus certain parts.)\nYou can cut portions, flip them with your rockets & move across them to get across other areas to reach your destinations. When using the Laser in this game I felt it copied exactly the percision that was used in games like Okami on the Playstation 2 literally perfect control which i give a great big Thumbs up to the developer.\n\nWhile I'm only a few hours in the game I'm loving every second of it. For such a small price the developer is asking you would literally be a fool not to give this game a chance. Its made by a caring developer who really I believe wanted to make the game while something very random it was also something amazing all at the same time.\n\nDefinite Buy from me and I hope I have persuaded you as well to give this game a purchase.","June 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/recommended/205910/","rabcor","Easter Bunny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rabcor/","382 products in account","This game is beyond awesome, I almost regret buying it on sale for 1$ because I'd value it at 15$ (same as soundtrack edition costs, which is what you should be buying as the soundtrack in this game rules!) if it was a bit longer, I'd value it a lot higher than that.\n\nI played it on (Arch) Linux, it took me 3 hours to finish, and it ran flawlessly from start to finish, It also supported X360 controller just fine on there. I'd say the game's length is going to be roughly 2 hours if you rush through it, 3 hours if you fool around and enjoy it a bit like I did, and even more if you actually bother looking for the secrets and easter eggs which I very much missed out on in my first playthrough.\n\nThe game is highly replayable as there are many ways to solve most of the puzzles, and a lot of secret areas. The game can also be modded and custom levels can be made (although sadly no workshop support for that content) but most important of all, this game is fun.\n\nIt was probably the most fun 3 hours i've spent for a number of years, the graphics were (intentionally) really cartoony, and the gameplay was a lot like one of those 3D puzzle games in their early days (I'm thinking Gex: Enter The Gecko) and as a result, I was taken back a good solid 15 years to back when I was a child and playing video games for the first time ever. It brought me a lot of joy.\n\nIt is worth noting the game is also child-friendly as the most questionable part of it is a small piece of the world lore narrated through wall paintings late in the game, and basic slapstick/cartoon violence.\n\nThis game is like a breath of fresh air, it is funny, it is fun, and it is cool, for a hands down rating:\n\nStory 9/10 (Really original and fairly unpredictable too)\n\nGameplay 9/10 (It was a 3D Puzzle game with a physics simulation that allows you to create your own paths through puzzles by cutting objects down and moving them around, almost every object in the game could be cut)\n\nGraphics 8/10 (The environment delivered the intended effect, the shortcoming of graphics which dropped it a bit was the character textures and how simple the textures of everything else was, models were also simple but that was a necessity in a low budget indie game like this with the gameplay mechanics. I can say though that one thing I loved about the game is that it has no UI/HUD, all it has is a crosshair to help you aim which is all you really need, it creates a nice immersive feeling not to worry about health bars or ammo or anything, the text messages that followed up with sound effects when objects smashed into each other was also really cool in my opinion.)\n\nSoundtrack 10/10 (Hands down the best soundtrack (system) in any video game ever, it was an intergrated part of the gameplay, you would unlock new music tracks by picking up audio tapes and then you could switch between them whenever you wanted with just the press of a button, there were several music tracks fitting like a glove on each of the environments the game offers and if by any case you didn't like a track, you would just change to the next one! Apart from how the system handled soundtrack, the music itself was awesome and personally for me good enough to listen to outside of the game even, you can use the two trailers as examples, I'm a fairly harsh critique when it comes to music too, so me endorsing a games soundtrack this much is extremely rare, the only other game I can think of I would ever score this high is The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind)\n\nControls 6/10 (This is the games weakest point, the game is very well playable on a keyboard and mouse, but aiming the laser is sometimes a little bit annoying and unintuitive, especially since it is limited to the field of view of your camera, and playing it with a controller just didn't work very well for me at all, I couldn't aim for ♥♥♥♥ with the controller which was the main issue on there (using the right analogue stick, but maybe it's just cus I suck with analogue sticks, there's also no auto-aim.) but I also noticed it was a lot harder to control my character with the analogue stick than with the keyboard, using the D-Pad works great though!)\n\nOverall: 9/10\n\nThis game is a Masterpiece!\n\nThis would've been 9.5 out of 10 if the game had been just about twice as long as it was, but like I mentioned, it can be modded and players can share new levels with each other which I imagine would be really cool! if only it was more popular and had a few dedicated modders, this would go a long way.\n\nReally great game, it surprised me a lot how good it was, I did not expect this! And the game ran like a well oiled machine without a hiccup on Linux which is more than can be said for most ports!","July 5, 2014","true","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you are like me than you love physics in video games. And not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ physics like in Goat Simulator which are just down right awful which I will probably write a review about soon. Anyway back to Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers. You play as Tiny who is assisted by his radio. Through the game you use a plethora of different tools to help you enjoy the physics that this game offers. The gameplay is outstanding! The tools are fun to use and my only complaint is that the jumping felt a little awkward for me but that is just my opinion. The graphics are great for it's cartoony style. The levels are fun with different ways to beat each one. Overall I give this game my approval and I hope that if you come to this review wondering if it is worth your money I say yes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tails86/recommended/205910/","Tails86","Wiikly Reviews","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tails86/","391 products in account","I have been looking at this game for a while and always was concerned about purchasing it. If your an indie gamer supporter and are wondering if this game is good Well here is what I think.\n\nFirst of all for a Indie Game this game is amazing to look at. Everything from the actual character models to the backgrounds to even seeing stuff in the distance is pretty awesome. The Game uses Celshaded visuals much like games such as No More Heroes, Legend of Zelda Windwaker, and Borderlands 2.\n\nMovement is solid whether your using Keyboard & Mouse or using a Controller and feels spot on. Jumping, Using your hook,  & rockets  are very simplified. You can take all the time you need as you start off in tutorials which the game very easily walks you through to get a feel of the game.\n\nThe Story is you are The Loser Tiny chasing after your nemesis & Thief Big who stole your Under pants and finds that they have Hidden Powers. (No do not go putting your Under Pants IRL on your head cause they dont have any of this kind of Power sadly D:)\n\nThe worlds are all very big and vast and you can practically do anything you wish in the game. You can roam around and look for boring stones or you can go use your rockets or hook to pull on blocks that you cut with your laser. The Entire area you roam around in Can be cut and used to help you. (up to about 95% of everything your near Minus certain parts.)\nYou can cut portions, flip them with your rockets & move across them to get across other areas to reach your destinations. When using the Laser in this game I felt it copied exactly the percision that was used in games like Okami on the Playstation 2 literally perfect control which i give a great big Thumbs up to the developer.\n\nWhile I'm only a few hours in the game I'm loving every second of it. For such a small price the developer is asking you would literally be a fool not to give this game a chance. Its made by a caring developer who really I believe wanted to make the game while something very random it was also something amazing all at the same time.\n\nDefinite Buy from me and I hope I have persuaded you as well to give this game a purchase.","June 19, 2014","true","9.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenJellyHome/recommended/205910/","GreenJellyHome","GreenJelly MIC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenJellyHome/","570 products in account","I spent an hour in this game getting to the door at what I thought was the exit of level 1.  After getting to the door, I found that it went out of the map and into nothing.  It was never finished and I ended up dying.  Turns out I was in a secrete room, and I got to a place your probably not suppose to be.  This is disapointing, as it is clearly accessable to thoose that try.  Wasted opportunity.\n\nI then got to the real exit, and when I started cutting the puzzle I found my patience completely gone.  The Puzzle was frustrating as the reason I can't do it in the required 90 seconds has more too do with the poor design of the game and its inability to allow you to cut things even when you line it right.  I just don't want too be judged by the developers lack of completion.\n\nThe game is nifty, allot like portal.  Its a physics game where you have to get Grandpa's Underwear. Wow, sounds like they where making a joke with the games objective.  Its not funny, but it does achieve the feeling that your wasting your time.  You have a grappling hook, a deployable rocket pusher, and a cutting laser.  You can cut certain things, but not everything.  The laser cuts in angles.  There seems to be allot to do, and lots to explore.  There are hidden places and achievements.  If things fall on you, you die.  If you fall, you die.\n\nIt starts out in a simulation that has a green filter in it.  After a few simulations, you get to level 1 which is in full color.  Thats when the "fun" starts.  Its interesting, but there are things like the puzzle at the end of level 1 only beign on the wall, and if you don't notice it you will get frustrated wondering why they only show you the solution for a split second.\n\nIts sad, the game could of been fun, but instead is unfinished and frustrating.  Its plagued with design and story challenges and it really makes you question why your wasting your time in it.  So I can not recommend it.  I am sorry, I usually play games for 10+ hours, but so far I am only left frustrated. :(","March 9","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

UNDERWEAR?\nThat's right! You know those ugly undies that your grandpa wears -- and that you probably wore when you were a kid? You should value them more, because they hold a power beyond imagination! On Tiny and Big: Grandpa's Leftovers you take control over Tiny, a young inventor on a quest to recover the pants passed down by his grandfather, which were stolen by Big. The plot seems extremely silly and childish, but T&B is truly a work of art with an eloquent sense of humor perfectly captured on the cartoonish art style and the indie-folk soundtrack.\n\nThe gameplay is based on a sandbox variation that lets you modify the world around you, but don't think that sounds promising if you're a construction sandbox fan!. At first it might seem like you'll be able to have lots of fun cutting things and changing the scenery, but the false sense of freedom soon falls flat and if you were expecting a true sandbox, you'll be disappointed. If you can cope with the fact that you'll only get things out of the way and eventually modify the world only to walk around, then the core mechanic becomes enjoyable, seemingly fresh and different. Aligned to how linear the levels are, this is the game's biggest weakness as well as its strength, considering how the puzzle difficulty escalates (not challenging, yet enjoyable).\n\nStory-wise the title delivers an enjoyable and unforgettable experience, but there was probably more room for development. The characters and the world around them are interesting, but the journey is just too short and linear, leaving us thirsty. With all my failures, it took me only three hours to beat the story.  Be it a sequel, a DLC or a comic book, T&B's world and characters are sure worth more content!\n\nConsidering how linear and relatively easy the game is, would've been beneficial if the developers had come up with a more simple modding tool (the existing one available at ModDB) and made use of Steam Workshop. If that had happened, T&B's could've been one of the best indie games of its generation with a large fanbase -- considering players could contribute lore-wise, expanding this amazing experience.\n\nPros:\nBeautiful polished cartoonish art style\nAn amazing indie-folk soundtrack ranging from different artists/bands\nEasy to catch gameplay\nComic value (not for everyone, though)\nUnforgettable cast and lore\nCons:\nExtremely short (around 3h, less if you don't mess up)\nFalse sense of freedom\nNo replay value\nNo "invert X axis" option\nCan't change camera sensibility for controllers\nA lot of wasted potential (although the game is still great and worth the full price, it still had a lot of potential)\nWorth the full price, worth on discounts and the soundtrack edition is a must have for indie-folk fans! Despite its short length and no replay value, the experience doesn't disappoint if you can understand its quirky art style and humor!","April 17, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Definitely a great game first time around. Took me about 2 hours to finish the game without collecting much of the hiddem items and music tapes etc. Not sure how much it would've added to complete levels "perfectly" but I felt that it would've been too booring task for me. The gimmick of cutting rocks with lazers making your own path feels great but I feel that after my initial playthrough it already wore thin.  Controls are a bit clunky which sometimes make you miss a jump but overral decent enough. Graphics wise the game looks a bit like Borderlands, cell-shaded and it suits the game. Music is a matter of taste and I didn't like it, way too apathetic for me. There is also this layer of humor in there as you are on a quest to get back your grandpa's leftovers, aka magical underpants that grant superpowers. This also felt like thin excuse of a story and I couldn't be bothered with it. Tried to start my second playthrough to gather the items I skipped the first time but it didn't hold much replay value for me. Note the short playtime and pick this game up when you feel the price is right.","March 23, 2015","true","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Finished this game in 4 hours. I didn't get too many achievements, but that's ok, because I'm just glad to be finished playing through the story. While I will give the creators an A+ for effort in coming up with a decent physics sandbox and a tool set to play with (rocket launcher, grappling hook and laser beam), the rest of the game is full of fail.\n\n1. The story line is non-existent, save for one meaningful cutscene. Dialogue, which would have been fairly humorous if they had used voice actors, is meh because the characters just squeak at eachother while you read speech bubbles.\n\n2. The controls, physics and surfaces are all tempremental. You can walk back and forth on a plank a handful of times, but then suddenly the next time you walk on it, you fall through it. Not off, *through.* Sometimes the laser freezes the object in mid air so you can cut it, sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes that beam you just cut falls perfectly and lands right where you want it, sometimes it bounces, spins out of control and kills you for your trouble. So frustrating...\n\n3. The game is criminally short for $10 dollars. Particularly in light of the fact there is no real plot moving you forward.\n\n4. I bought the sound track along with the game for an additional $5 dollars. Sadly, about a third of the music is amusing and catchy, the rest is "meh" at best and elevator music at worst.\n\n5. Achievements are basically grind quests... use this item 1000 times, or collect 1000 of these boring rocks (a quest for boring rocks? I bet that will hold the player's attention...).\n\n6. I get that the art is supposed to be weird and unique. I get that we're in a desert. But the color palette was really bland and the lack of contrast sometimes made it difficult to gauge distances, depth or to distinguish cuttable surfaces from non-cuttable.\n\n\nOverall, I cannot recommend this game. If at some point it goes on sale for $1, then sure, pick it up. But until then, you're better off buying a better physics sandbox like Garry's Mod.\n\nAgain, I will give kudos to the creators for the level of freedom (or total absence of direction?) when it comes to solving the puzzles and navigating the environment in the game. With the tools at your disposal you can theoretically shape the environment to your will. In practice, however, what surfaces are cuttable, the effectiveness of your rocket launcher and grappling hook on moving things in the environment, and your ability to slide and stack stones without getting snagged on something in the environment is somewhat arbitrary.","December 10, 2014","false","4.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Movement is jerky and inconsistent, which doesnt gel with having to pull off well-timed jumps or navigate along, very often, very narrow bridges and ledges.\nThen we come to the cutting mechanic which, while fun, is not intuative to control, at all. This makes it often frustrating when a misplaced cut can mean having to reload to the last checkpoint.\nIt also means that when the game puts you under preasure, forcing you to line up and perform cuts very quickly, you will die. A lot. Having a very cumbersome, slow and counter-intuative aiming mechanic does not partner well with having only a couple of precious seconds to aim, line up and cut a giant rock that's flying at your head.\n\nAnd then there's the problem with using physics to place your platforms. When you cut down a pillar to make a bridge, because of the physics, it often won't make a bridge. It'll tumble down that gaping crevasse you were trying to cross. Also, if you're the type of gamer who wants to get every last collectable, you will watch them tumbling down that crevasse, even if the bridge lands properly, because they too, have physics, and will bounce and roll straight into the abyss.\n\nThe soundtrack, though, is truly awesome, but I wouldn't reccomend this game unless you are very patient, or a masochist.","February 11, 2015","false","1.4"," 13 of 29 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","13","29","0","0"

Sure, the game mechanics are a neat little experiment that was done pretty successfully, but there are other personal problems I have with this game.\n\n-For a start, this game is weird and somewhat clunky with a gamepad. Odd, considering this is a platformer where a gamepad would be perfect, but nope, mouse and keyboard works confusingly better. Not so much of a complaint but more of a nitpick.\n\n-Jumping is super weird. I kept on dying on the god damn tutorial because either the game is incredibly picky on where and when you should land or the camera decides to be a bee-atch when you most need it (like with most games in this genre, so I can give it a bit of a pass).\n\n-The gameplay, while innovative (I guess), got boring at a quick hiccup. Playing this seems like a chore rather than being fun.\n\n-The game has this somewhat irritating hipster attitude that kept on reminding you that this is a indie game, with indie music, and a indie story that is far more "wacky" and "random" than any other tripe-A game.\n\n-Speaking of music, this game's "oh-so-important" music is actually quite lame. Nevermind the fact that the game outright gives you a radio just for the music itself.

I paid $1 on sale and it wasn't really worth it.\nI was not a fan of the ambient music, which plays as a radio station type deal, except for a few select tracks.\nThere are some limits on the number of cuts you can use per level that getting under gets you an achievement or something. I personally just used tons and tons of cuts on each level. Most of the rocks in the world can be cut so why not cut them.\nMy biggest complaint is that the game is extremely boring. There is hardly any sense of discovery. The rock cutting mechanic gets pretty stale. I found myself using the grapple a  lot but the rocket almost never except when it was required to advance.\nThe control is pretty bad too. You'll notice in the first couple seconds of moving around in the game that the movement is extremely stiff for some reason and Tiny's jump is terrible. Sometimes the most difficult thing was just walking around, trying not to fall off, die, and have any collectibles you got since you passed a checkpoint return to their original positions.","June 19, 2014","false","3.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

That is until the BOSS FIGHTS start in the last third of this about two hour long game. From here the game descends to a extremely frustrating trial and error dodge run and jumping puzzles, in a low light environment, that you you repeat over and over to find that one solution, while giant rock blocks are raining down on you. All the freestyle puzzles are thrown out of the window.  This and the fact that game mechanics do not really support that kind of dodge run, while shoot blocks out of the sky, totally ruined  the great impression of the first 2 thirds.

The concept was there, but the game wasn't. I have about 2 hours in the game, and I beat it pretty easily. Once you get the hang of the game, most of it is pretty straight forward and simple. However, the controls are weak and clunky. Half the time  you freeze blocks in the air as you click on them to make a line to cut them, and the other half of the time the block freezes after the cut starts. This randomness of the gameplay causes unessisary deaths at the hands of thrown rocks.\n\nThe game was somewhat comical, but I've played much funnier games that used this silly, almost dry, humor. I was sorely disappointed in the fact that it was so short. As much fun as the concept is, I'm regretting putting money down for this game.

Well, that title is half-right.\n\nI'd probably replace "Big" with "Mediocre", though!\n\nTiny and Big is a game that has a lot of good ideas, a really solid engine with some great physics functions and not much else. The gameplay ranges from mildly enjoyable to downright repetitive and quickly grows old. Luckily, it doesn't have much time to stay boring because it ends after a mere two and a half hours.\nThe story is nonsensical, full of exposition, and bland while the characters are bland and not well fleshed out. That doesn't really matter, though, because by the time you've decided which of the three main characters you hate more, it's over.\n\nThe writing is awful and full of spelling mistakes and the graphics are one of the few redeeming qualities of this game. The game itself breaks often, leaving you stuck post-checkpoint with no option but to restart the level. The "boss fight(s)" is repeated two or three times identically and only really gets enjoyable the last time... and then ends.\n\nI paid $2.50 for this and it (just barely) managed to make my $1/hour ratio. I would not advise paying more than $2.50 for this game, as I feel I pretty much wasted my time with this game overall.\n\nIf they had fleshed it out, gave it better pacing, and ditched the story entirely, it could have been great.\n4.5/10","December 5, 2012","false","3.6"," 8 of 23 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","8","23","0","5"

It's incredible. It freezes my entire PC for no reason. Care to share with us what programming tricks you used to make your game so resilient?

I bought the game when it was on sale for a buck I think, with that said; I enjoyed the hell out of this game. I am giving the game a thumbs up because it did what I wanted it to do. It told a story(As goofy as it may be) it has some AMAZINGLY fun game play mechanics behind it and the way the game looks is just perfect for the style of game it is.\n\nNow with that said, I have to point out that the level design is so muddled at times, I find myself unable to figure out which way to go and just end up building a bridge out of walls or boulders to get to new areas. Even when following "the boring stones" I still managed to lose my placing or just destroy my path entirely. But I suppose that's my fault, cutting everything I see in half just so I can stand atop it like a elvish king of pants.\n\nMaybe it is worth the price tag... Had fun [Check]...

Well, I installed it, gave it a try, and I must say it is a strange game but quite amusing.\nIn the game, you play as Tiny, chasing a guy named Big. The basic premise of the game is to get from one area to the next, and the main way to do that is with a cutting laser. You basically carve your way through the terrain and hack up large rocks and ancient ruins, while trying to get your 'pants' (read 'underwear') back from Big. Or were they your Grandpa's pants? Doesn't really matter.\nThis game is fun, and very different. Have a look at the videos in the store and decide if the game is for you. I didn't pay for it directly, so I'm not sure if I would pay the $10 for it, I never had to consider if I wanted to buy the game or not.

It may be short for some (around 3 hours of playtime if you do the story once), but it can be fun trying to collect all the achievements and such (which makes it around 14 hours of playtime).\nThe design looks amazing, the soundtracks are great and the story is a lot of fun. (For some reason, it reminded me of adventure time, for those who are interested.) It has some replayability, and there are different ways to complete a level. It actually depends on your imagination.\nI really hope Black Pants will either continue the series or make another fun game, because they've already proven with this game that they are capable of creating awesome games!","July 11, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using different tools and tricks to get you through the massive levels, while listening to a cool soundtrack, was an awesome time. You use a laser gun, rockets, and a grapple gun to hack apart massive stone structures, and arrange them in ways to get where you want to go. It's only downfall is that it is too short.  The game can probably be finished in an hour and a half without any time spent exploring or getting to extra collectible items.\nI am eagerly awaiting a sequel.","July 12, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll start with the good sides.\n------------------------\nGood Sides\n------------------------\n\n#1: The graphics overall are outstanding. It gives you a feel to the game, and it lets you know what he's feeling. It's hard to explain, but I'll just say that it gives atmosphere to the game, and I like that about it.\n\n#2: The gameplay is fun. It's always a mystery as to what's next in the game, and it is extremely action packed.\n\n#3: The equipment you use. Oh my gosh. I love them. The laser is my favorite. Oh, you wanted to cut that mountain in half? Guess what! If it's small enough, you can. Bam.\n\n-----------------------\nBad Sides\n-----------------------\n\n#1: The game itself is extremely short. It has 6 levels. SIX. LEVELS. It seems unfair to spend 10 or more dollars on this if I can't atleast play more than 15 levels or so! Sure, they may be complex, but still. Six levels.\n\n#2: The game is hard. And I mean HARD. You make one wrong move, you're dead. It does make it exciting, but it never gives you a break unless you're in the first level, which is essentially the tutorial.\n\n#3: At some points in the game, if you don't get it just right, you won't make it past the first part of the level. I spent almost 2-3 hours on one point of the level in which I almost got a sledgehammer to smash my comuter open with.\n\n#4: It's laggy as crap. You have to turn down the graphics at some points.\n\n\n----------------------\n\nAltogether, the game was interesting. It's fun, but it just wasn't good enough for me to recommend. Sure, it had good graphics and gameplay, but I just wasn't feeling it. I liked the laser though.\n\nOverall Rating: 7/10\n\n","August 5, 2014","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not one for puzzle games, but I had a great deal of fun with this game (mind you I'm only on level 2 at this point).\nFirst the good;\nThe music is wonderful and using more tracks as collectables makes me what to actually collect them. I personally find the game is rather easy, but the player can easily make it a bit more difficult by slicing apart blocks, then having to figure out the *new* puzzle, which I did quite a few times without meaning too. the game is great at getting the player to actually feel like what he does matters towards the puzzles, and that no one route is correct. The art style is nice, and suits the gameplay well. The tools you get to use are fun, and one can quickly pick out which one of the three is their favourite. It's incredibly easy to pick up too, and begin finding your own solutions.\n\nNow the Bad;\nThe plot isn't really there, and often I forgot all about it, focusing more on the actual gameplay. Second, your character, Tiny, moves very quickly, and jumps rather far. This makes the game feel somewhat slippy, and is annoying (for the most part I only died cause I was screwing around and fell).\n\nThere's not a whole lot to this game if you don't like the actual gameplay, and people who like solid plots will be disappointed. I'm glad I got T&B on sale, or I would not have bought it. It's too short with too little to pay $10 for, and so I do not recommend buying this game full price. However it is worth it to buy it while is on sale for cheap. Overall I rate this game (based on the first 2 levels + tutorial) a 8.5/10. It's good, maybe even great, but lacks story and length.","June 18, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Making my own way through the levels was interesting (extra so in later levels) and I found myself just wondering around sometimes looking to see what else I could cut and where else I could go, but if I had paid full price for this then I might have been very upset.\n\nFor the current set price, no, I can not honestly recommend this. There isn't enough to keep me busy for $10. There just isn't. The game is short. The story is a bit nonsensical (though amusing and will keep you entertained while you play).

This game puts you in the feet of Tiny - a person who inherited a pair of underwear that give ultimate power! But, those pants were stolen by Big - Tiny's brother. The main goal of the game is for you to get those pants back from Big, which never happens. I wont spoil the ending for you. The game is very much worth the 10 euros ( AKA the 0.99 I paid for it during sale ). The game provides you with a cutting tool, a pulling tool and a pushing rocket. The rocket is mostly useless, but it does come in handy sometimes. In the background, you discover the story of little black animals that live in the desert, it is sad and a little bit disturbing, but it makes the game more interesting. The only downside is the time it takes to complete it. There is no multiplayer mode, no coop, no minigames. It took me 2 hours to complete the game and so did my friends.

I created an account, and needed to validate it somehow, and this was the first thing that was advertised to me.  "10% off!?" I thought to myself. "Wow, this whole Steam thing is great! What a bargain! I'll buy it!"\n\nAnd despite numerous humblebundles, numerous 75% sale items later, I have never felt worse for not paying for a game at its full price.\n\nDespite being a genre I would never usually play, it's been one of my all-time favorite games. Truthfully, it is short, but in my quest to get all achievements, I can safely say I spent a decent amount of time on it. Some games are suited to short playthroughs, and I consider this one of them - made any longer and it may turn into repetition.\n\nI highly recommend this if you're looking for a burst of fun, a unique/ridiculous Mambo-style aesthetic and story, and some pretty obscure but totally listenable indie music.","April 8, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is proof that coders so often have fantastic senses of humour. Me, I enjoyed this game enough that when and if the same gaming company comes out with another game I'll most definately want to try the demo. For me, that's how I see my own gaming, as I'm not a hard core gamer at all but have found some very cool games inside Steam that are a little on the Indie side. There are some realy fantastic creative minds to be found in some of the lesser known gaming companies and this game is one of them. 5 stars. Good times.

The game gives you the freedom of choosing how to beat each level, giving multiple solutions as to how you can get across an obstacle. The game is not _hard_, but it's still interesting enough to be exciting. You can either follow the plot and get through things as quickly as possible (which is perfectly fine cuz you can always replay it), or you can just walk around (assuming that rocks aren't hurled at you lol) and explore/cut almost everything you see (esp. in the beginning). The music is great and so is the graphics. There are also some hidden achievements that i stumbled upon (discovering a hidden room, etc.). Overall it's a pretty fun game.\n\n[I got the game when it was on sale, so it was an awesome game for that price (i think it was $1).]","June 19, 2014","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphic style of the game is very cartoonish but solid comparable to borderlands 2 style grapics. The game is very well balanced and will run on very poor computer although not on max graphics. Controls are very simple and easy to master mostly just moving with the regular movement keys and the actions are all mounted to the mouse buttons.

The story is as unique as it is interesting, and it's a welcome break from other serious storylines.

I noticed this game again when it was on sale for $0.99, so I really checked it out because it's hard to pass up good deals like that if I can get just a few hours of enjoyment out of it.\n\nI am really glad that I did. The game is very good and a whole lot of fun too, You get to basically destroy the environment as much as you want, and this is how you are able to make your goals, as long as you aren't crushed to death or destroy your only way across. The gameplay is very unique as well as the art and music style, but it all went very well together. There are tons of secrets you can find, so if you like that as well, this game is for you. It is a bit of a short game, but you can probably get several+ hours of gameplay out of it if you like to explore and find a lot of the secrets, a lot less if you just rush through your games.\n\nIn my opinion, this game was worth a whole lot more than I payed for it. I would love to see a sequel to this game, found the laser/rocket/claw to be a lot of fun to play around with, so it would be awesome to have another game like this (perhaps in a different environment?). Anyways, buy it, it's a lot of fun.","June 20, 2014","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It just doesn't have anything outstanding going for it. The idea of manipulating your enviroment to your advantage seems pretty cool but it gets old really fast. Most of the game is pretty much just spam cutting everything you see. The paths you need to take are often very obvious so there goes the idea of puzzling your way to victory.\n\nThe visuals are mediocre. The world is just consisting of some kind of desert temple areas which switch to weird sci-fi interiors.\n\nThis might be just my personal opinion but i think the idea to collect songs in the world for the game to play is terrible. You will just listen to the same songs over and over again for about 2 hours and you will get really sick and tired of them.\n\nOverall i would give the game a generous 4/10.","June 18, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are a couple areas where some of the platforming seems poorly thought out or sloppy, especially in the latter half of the game, but the quirky dialogue and downright weird storyline keep you going.\n\nAlso, I should mention that there really isn't much else to the game other than playing with the laser, rocket booster, and grapple. It can get a little repetitive, as they're all introduced to you in the beggining, and everything following that is just using these tools to progress, often in a somewhat repetitive manner.","August 10, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has a somewhat stupid, yet amusing and pleasant story, gameplay is very satisfying yet being a bit finicky here and there, and the graphics is fine for the art style.\nAnd after you've seen all of that, there's the soundtrack - and it's actually really damn good! It accompanies the game's story and style perfectly at every point - that is, if you're happy with acoustic music.\n\nSo what's then the downside of this game? Well, the length. You might get around 3-5 hours out of it, depending how long you play it, and while there is some replay value for completionists through a whole bunch of side-puzzles and achievements, its not a game you would play twice in a row.\n\nBut other than that, if the game is on sale for a few bucks, you should absolutely pick it up for a few good laughs and some relaxed derping around.

Don't be fooled by the ridiculous plot. If you can ignore the immaturity of the storyline, you're in for a real treat.\n\nThe game mechanics are surprising; the innovation in the cutting and pulling concept caught me as almost Portal-esque. Being able to slice through the environment, and manipulate it as smoothly as this game allows is a wonderfully fun experience. The art style is superb, and more than makes up for the lower graphics. Lower graphics are completely fine by me anyway, given the gameplay. The soundtrack is unique, nothing super noteworthy but not bad either.\n\nMuch of my praise for this game apart from the unique gameplay concept is the amount of love that went into all of the hidden secrets. Cheers to Black Pants Game Studio. If you are one of those people who likes to wander into random, dark corners of the world to hunt for easter eggs, you will like this game. The in-game text even jokes with you at points for wandering into such a corner. The main storyline (apart from the actual plot) is pleasant as well. I would bet that even if you were to run straight through the game, you'd be pleased with the environments.\n\nUltimately, I was quite surprised with this game. It cost me about $2.50 on sale, but I would gladly pay much more having experienced it. This is basically the game I would make if I could make games.\n\nIf you can grab it for this price and you've liked what I've mentioned, you can't really go wrong picking this up.\nDon't be another boring rock.","December 31, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, this game is very short and can be beaten in just  a few hours. But should that take away from the overall experience? No! The price maybe...actually definitely the price, but certainly not the experience. The artistic style is simple, beautiful and gives off a nice 'Playstation 2 in High Definition' feel to it, and the soundtrack is very reminiscent of 'LittleBigPlanet'; two of the most refreshing aspects of the game. And I don't know about you, but I needs me some good songs when I be platforming.\n\nThe idea of finding songs is also a great way of encouraging exploration; something most newer games still don't get right. There is no voice acting, only grunts and groans ike in the early 'LEGO' games, but this only adds to the overall retro feel of the game. And the whole 'cut-anything-you-want-to-get-to-where-you-need-to-go' thing also reminded me of the original 'Red Faction' game; which is a very good thing. So overall, for a game where you search for lost pants, it's definitely worth playing through, if only once. Fans of older platformers will definitely appreciate this one as well as there are several aspects from games long forgotten.","November 24, 2014","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No way! That's just awesome." It's just too short. I finished the game in about 8 hrs and a lot of that was just goofing around trying to do ridiculous things and trying to get to this one bridge. I got over to it once and then smushed myself and couldn't do it again. I will try again.\n\nI loved the hidden cassette tapes to unlock new background music, i thought that was a really cool idea that actually benefitted me outside of the game because all the music is awesome. I also really enjoyed the story. The world was immersive and really well thought out. Now I want to know more about those giant animal sculptures, the story of taxibot, more about grandpa!\n\nWhat i didn't like: I do wish there were more characters. I wish it were longer. I wish there were more levels. I also wish I could erase it from my brain and play again like its the first time.\n\nThe fact that I'm even writing a review shows how much i LOVED this game.\n\nI miss you already Tiny and Big.
