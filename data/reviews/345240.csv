Brings back so many memories, and now I get to play it again!\n\nThe game is very different than moder TW games. You really have to get used to the comands and camera control. E.g. you don't move units by right clicking but by left clicking (in the battle), and that feels really wierd. The campaign is also completely different, but nothing you can't figure out with a couple of hours of gameplay.\n\nThe graphics: what can I say, don't expect much. For a game released in 2000 it is revolutionary. And they made a good job optimizing it. It maybe is pixelated, but it runs and looks smooth, and I personaly love the retro look, it gives a totaly different feeling to the game. It runs in fullscreen on 1920x1080, but only in the campaign and the battles. The main menu doesn't cover the whole screen, which is kind of dissapointing and strange, but not a super big deal.\n\nThe music, the sounds, the atmosphere, the graphics. This game, together with Medieval, takes you back in time, when it all started. And to have that oportunity is simply amazing.\n\nIf you never played this game but you have played modern TW games, I cannot recommend it enough, get it now !!","June 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 124 of 132 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","124","132","13","10"

I borrowed a copy from a friend and, sure enough, it would not start. After developer credits it would crash to desktop every single time. I tried all sorts of fixes, but nothing made the game work. I had no choice but to accept the upsetting fact that it was just completely incompatible with modern software. I was very sad about this because, being a fan of other Total War games, I really wanted to play this one and experience first-hand the evolution of the series.\n\nCan you believe my luck? A week later Creative Assembly/Sega release this game on Steam, updated to run on my OS: Windows 8.1 64-bit, and it works perfectly! Not only that, but they also release Medieval: Total War; which also works! That's not all. The main menu screen is fixed to default resolution, but the in-game resolution can be maxed out to 1920 x 1080, and it looks stunning. Game is still simple-looking, but highly detailed and addicting.\n\nThis was a very nice surprise that caught me totally off guard. They've made me one of the happiest gamers today!","June 25, 2015","true","12.0"," 91 of 98 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","91","98","6","1"

It has the dated charm of the 00's and lacks the impressive graphics of later Total War games, but it is my contention that this game is a great one in its own right.\n\nOne might think that the only reason to get the game is for nostagia's sake. And there is no denying that a significant percentage of the purchases will probably come from old players. One advantage of this copy compared to the old one that you might still own is that it is now compatible mith modern operating systems. I am personnally using windows 7 and have had no problems playing a few turns in the campaign and winning a custom battle. Moreover, the price tag is quite reasonable.\n\nThe game is 15 years old and the graphics are no longer up to today's standards. They still have a certain charm to them and it does not prevent having fun at all. In addition, the game offers several campaigns - including one about a hypothetical mongol invasion of Japan.\n\nHowever, the game is much more than just a means to satiate your nostalgia. The game is different from all Total War games that would follow (barring its successor Medieval), mainly regarding the campaign map. It uses a Risk-like campaign map, which means that movement is much more restrained. This allows for totally different campaign dynamics and really gives a fresh feel to the campaign, at least for Total War veterans who are not used to this campaign-style. One of the main advantages of this system is that it is much simpler and the AI can therefore cope with it significantly better than with the totally open campaign of later iterations. This makes the campaign both fun and challenging, as defeat becomes a very real possibility.\n\nRegarding battles, the principles applied in later iterations were already present in Shogun and the most interesting feature is that there are lots of historical battles, grouped in different historical campaigns (Nobunaga, Ieyasu, Hideyosi and a mongol one). Playing those historical campaigns gives a nice sense of progression and is quite rare in later iterations.\n\nAfter explaining the pros and cons of the game, I hope that I could convey the particular feel of this game, and I can only commend this game to those who want a different Total War experience!","June 26, 2015","true","4.6"," 55 of 60 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","55","60","3","1"

And in many ways it holds its own against the newer revisions.  But like most games, the AI is both good, but also full of holes.  AI is just plain hard to write and the devs did a good job on it.  But you see the holes after you have played a lot and thus start to pay attention to certain details.  Eventually you figure out the game loopholes and rediculous exploits and the game looses its luster.  You can currently get a Steam Key for the Gold Edition from Humble for a buck which is quite a deal.  The Gold edition has a few bugs in it but nothing that inhibits gameplay.\n\nTo show what I mean about how the AI is limited, consider that it is possible to win a game while never attacking.  You achieve this by:\n\n1. teching up to Geisha and assassinating mercilessly\n2. improving your lands for greater KOKU production so you can afford the upgrade path\n3. adding units prudently when affordable to not look too weak\n4. bribing Ronin armies for cheap units\n5. allying with other clans to delay them from attacking you for as long as possible\n6. inciting revolts in other clans' provinces around yours to further keep their armies tied up\n\nNote how with this strategy you never have to initiate battle.  You can eliminate all rival clans by 1560 this way.  Give it a try.  It makes for a different kind of game.","September 23, 2015","true","426.7"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","26","27","2","2"

There is nothing one can say about Total War Shogun which can dissprove that it is old. However, being the person I am, I decided to play all of the Total War series  and played Total War Shogun. The game in itself is pretty clunky (perks of being old) and lacks the depth of other Total War games. The real time battle squences are probably the clunkiest part of the game as they are slow and pixelated. Sometimes I couldn't even see what was going on. The game IMO is a bit easier and more straightforth compared to other Total War games (which is probably because of the lack of depth being the very first one in the series).\n\nIn my playthrough, I conquered all of Japan and became the Shogun :) For those who played this when it came out, Total War Shogun was extremely fun and groundbreaking. However, because I am playing this game in 2016 (16 years later I believe), I cannot recommend this game based on todays standards. But if you are playing the game for some early Total War fun and can bear through the graphics, then go ahead an play this. Otherwise go play Shogun II.\n\nRating: 6.2/10","January 4","false","3.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game still has that clunkiness you'd expect yet is a fun game to just have and break out every now and then. I can only barely recommend buying it full price as you may just have it sitting idle in your library.","January 5","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me 3 hours to complete the game. I'm not a fan of battles so I decided to settle them with the help of AI. I really enyojed the medieval climate of Japan and the possibility to change the course of history in this part of the world.\n\nThis interesting title with low requirements will satisfy every gamer, who likes strategies and doesn't possess a mighty PC.","May 20","true","5.2"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It was an amazing game to me, and it still is, 15 years later. Sure, its a bit dated, and the throne room audio is broken and they dont give a damn, but its the essential total war experience for cheap. This is how it all started, and thats worth something.","June 6","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
