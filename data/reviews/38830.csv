It used to be a game that while you could buy weapons and grear, you could do missions and earn materials to create weapons and gear as good as or even better than what was available in the store. Slowly, those items were no longer available to the crafter and were only available to the winners of tournaments, thus making it impossible for new players or existing players to gain any equal equipment as the veterns. A great idea that was distroyed by the greed of whoever was managing the game, as the original company had long sold its interest in the game.","August 17, 2015","false","110.0"," 190 of 214 people (89%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","89","190","214","24","1"

After that, the launcher will show you a "repair option". It will include: the game and one punkbuster. Now, the game will work good.\n☺ The playability is good: TPS with not bad camara control (you will have at least 1 blind point), good aim system, FPS aim (press F), a lot "game modes" (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CrimeCraft#Combat_Modes) & weird melee combat system.\n☺ TF2 Hat when you get level 6.\n☹ You will find people playing online this days: friday, saturday and sunday.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theownz/recommended/38830/","theownz","Preposterown","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theownz/","41 products in account","Free to Play - Pay to Enjoy\nThis review will be pretty brief. I wanted to like this game...but I won't be playing it again.\n\nThe Good\nWell...that was quick...\n\nThe Bad\n- Bulky controls mixed with fast-paced combat make for a nice train wreck.\n\n- The PvP is an imbalanced mess. This is frustrating for everyone. The seasoned players get paired up with new players and the new players have little chance to keep pace unless they instantly invest some cash into the game. This is not likely considering they just started. Even more-so after force-feeding players advertisement after advertisement. We all got it the first time; you want us to buy stuff. If a player doesn't get the message beforehand, they will after they realize that they only have a chance against an opponent once they have spent as much as that opponent, weather the price be time or money.\n\n- The game is called CrimeCraft...where is the crafting? Oh, you mean that hand-full of item categories. Your character is locked into one category of crafting (A.K.A. the character's "profession"). That would make sense if there where more than five tiers of items to make or that half of the items weren't null from the start.\n\n- The advertisements are more obnoxious than the majority of the player base. One of the first things you learn about psychology is that force equals resistance. Players are forced to see advertisements on every load screen. The players are forced to make purchases in order to have some of the most basic of game play mechanics available to them. Force is applied to just about everything in this game in an attempt to nickel and dime the player.\n\n- The missions are repetitive, generic, and grow dull quickly. The rewards in the end really aren't much of a motivation to play the missions.\n\nThe Ugly\n- Starting off with character creation...awful. The actual appearance of the characters is awful. They all look like the trash you would see on Jerry Springer, Maury, or Cops (maybe that is the point). The clothing is awful. Not everyone wants to have a character that looks like some ****head thug or some other digital manifestation of concentrated ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think that is the best way to sum up the character appearance; concentrated ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Hey! There's a new name for the game!\n\n- The levels, maps, stages, whatever you want to call them. They aren't very well designed. Not as in how they look, they look decent enough. But the layouts themselves. I guess I should have said bulky controls plus fast paced combat in mediocre arenas make for a nice train wreck.\n\nLike I said, I really wanted to like this game. Its a really good concept that was butchered in production. There's a lot of untapped potential here, but I don't see that potential ever being recognized. Seems the developers are fine with mediocre as long as there's players that will pay cash for mediocrity.","November 29, 2014","false","3.7"," 70 of 83 people (84%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","84","70","83","24","0"

First, don't look at my play hours. It might seems to be only 200 hours in steam, but my playtime probably exceed more than thousand. I play this game back when bleedout was just started to be release.\n\nIt is also the only game I ever spent over $100 USD, For some of you, $100 might seems small change. But for me, that was huge sum to pay for a game considering my country currency being low (At about 3:1 ratio to US dollar back then). I don't often spend more than $5 USD to purchase game, let alone spending $100 for a single game alone. This pretty much tell you how spectacular and fantastic this game was back then if you are willing to fork out such a huge amount of cash for it.\n\nOn the good old day, you cannot spend cash to purchase overpowered stuff to wreck havoc upon your enemy. You need skill, teamwork and flexibility in order to win. The only reason you pay is to get some awesome skin for your clothes or weapon. Even if you pay for those gear, those gear are pretty much average and can be easily earn by free user as long as they grind for it (You don't need to grind too hard for it either).\n\nThe developer and game master on the good old day would be willing to listen to player suggestion, have lot's of event and actively participate it. Even tournament in the good old time was very intense and fun. Hell, you might even call me crazy for waking up at 6am just to participate the tournament. You also meet a lot of player and the community was pretty nice to you, even if you are new player. This pretty much sum up how much fun I had in the old time.\n\nThen suddenly come the dark age where everything just go wrong. Developer start to sell overpowered gear at ridiculous amount of price just to milk the community, game master no longer active and worst of all, start to banned player from forum for criticize their policy. Hell, you can even get banned for giving solution to the problem faced by the community. You simply cannot say No, you must be Yes man or else you get banned from the forum.\n\nThey even start to implement some ridiculous and stupid suggestion by paying user. What is it, you might be wondering?\nThey want Gold Division Tournament to have an even higher level restriction, so player level 20 would not be able to participate it. You want to participate tournament with level 20 character? Sure you can, but only up to Silver or Bronze Division.\n\nAt what pretext they want to barred level 20 character from participate? There is various reason which some I came into acceptance, but some of the most stupid reason that are accepted by the developer which came from the pay user is that good player with level 20 character would own the rest of the level 50 player with his op skill and gear. First thing that cross my mind is, are the developer demented?\n\nFirst of all, how can a level 20 gear (Particularly weapon and armor) much stronger and powerful than a level 50 gear? Even if you purchase level 20 gear with real cash, there is none of the gear even came close enough to compete with free high-end gear. Second, lot's of ability are inaccessible for low level character and level 20 boost have much weaker effect than level 50 boost. So, tell me. How is that possible for level 20 to be more OP than level 50? If a player could defeat you with level 20 character, what makes it impossible for him to beat you with level 50 character? Do tell. Let's not forgot it was tournament, which means everybody would be using their best gear. Would a level 50 player participate tournament while ill equip? Surely you jest.\n\nYou might be wondering if I am the one who are being insane to begin with, since I am using a low level character for Gold division tournament. Well, I for one love challenge and there is nothing wrong to be playing handicap. If you play long enough and try everything, surely you want to push your boundary. See how far you can go with your skill. Another reason I go into Gold Division with low level character is to test the capability of low level character since lot's of low level player complain about their incapability to compete against high level player.\n\nFrom what I experience, yes it is possible for low level player to compete against high level player if their skill are on par. Unfortunately, this doesn't bode well with pay user. They would accuse you of hacking and give whatever reason they could find just to tarnish your reputation, in order to get rid of you forever. My level 20 character probably the only lowest level character that ever won and bearing the "Gold Winner" title (If you are in game, check for a character name Lisa Rogan with the title if you don't believe me). I am not trying to brag here, but it give me a sense of accomplishment that I could compete on equal ground against high level player (Which some of them even used Pay To Win Gear) and to prove the theory that low level player cannot win against high level player with better gear are just a myth.\n\nIn case you are wondering if I purchase gear with cash, my answer is No. I only purchase those fancy skin just to make my character look fabulous. Overall, this pretty much just one case whereby the developer slowly turn insane and only listen to pay user. Infact, their lust and desire grew beyond redemption to the extend they introduce countless of Pay To Win gear and banned several prominent and well known player under the pretext of cheating while those real cheater are roaming free in the server.\n\nThose very same cheater that goes scott free are their very own pay user. You got the drift right? You pay me to get those OP gear to own noob while I banned those guy you cannot beat in fair match just so you could win the tournament. 1 for developer, 1 for pay user and 0 for good player.\n\nThink I am lying? Ask some of the ex-player to clarify it.","June 28, 2015","false","228.6"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","29","44","0","0"

You cannot customize your avatar till level 3.  You cannot customize your game selection till level 3.  You don't see the RPG city part of the game till you reach level 5.

Not sure if being on the losing side in a PVP match gives you xp.  Kept getting stomped and had to ragequit before the match ended.\n\nGame does load and work, had no problem login in.

Unfortunately, while I had tons of fun with it, it's basically dead and can't be recommended for various reasons.\n\n- The game relies on X-Trap which isn't compatible with Windows 10, thus blocking out lots of potential players.\n- The game had been sold to a different team a few years ago which has long stopped supporting CC. Don't expect any kind of new content or hotfixes or whatnot. You'll rarely see any GMs and all the team seems to be doing is rolling out the same old events and bonus rates.\n- The economy is heavily leaning towards those willing to spend money on CC. Most matches see at least one or two players with high-end gear impossible to get through normal means.\n- A certain singleplayer mission is bugged so an NPC you need to escort gets stuck in the same place. Contacting the support does nothing and I only managed to get past it by repeatedly starting the mission over and over again until I finally got lucky.\n- Another singleplayer mission has you play under the influence of some experimental drugs which has its effect grow stronger and stronger over the course of the mission. It tries so simulate dizziness and succeeds far too well at it. I had never been feeling sick when playing a game before (been gaming for more than 25 years now), but this mission had mee feeling sick for the rest of the day.\n\nOn the plus side:\n+ The singleplayer campaign can't objectively be called good, but I enjoy these kinds of low-tech, cheesy FPS. It is fun blasting through various locations and the story actually is rather well-written with numerous factions fighting for power in a war-torn city.\n+ There are tons of side-quests and in-game achievements (most of these are not Steam achievemnts, though)\n+ There is also a great variety in game-modes and skill/weapon configurations\n+ The action simply feels right thanks to accurate weapon feedback, satisfying melee combat and a roll manouever that allows for more flexibility.\n\nAll in all it once was a great game ahead of its time that shouldn't - or rather cannot be played properly anymore. If it ever gets fixed (probably would need to be sold to another team again) I'd happily dive back in,\n\nAlso a note on Steam achievements: Some of these require HEAVY grinding like the one that asks you to spend 100 days in instances (so this means a whopping 2400 hours playing not counting the time you spend in the hub areas) and others don't even unlock properly like the ones relating to gang activities.","May 15","false","417.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I didn't really think it was good back then, I still don't think it's really good now anyway. Don't take my words for it though, most of the reviews you read will tell you the same thing: it is mostly a dead game these days. You could find a few matches here and there, but even if you do, I can assure you they're mostly inhabited by players of the same clan/community, and you'll end up with either 1 out of 2 outcomes:\n\n1) You get kicked because they're having their lovely "clan battles".\n2) You get mowed down by an entire clan teaming up against you.\n\nLucky for you, CrimeCraft isn't all about PvP. It has PvE matches (which actually incorporates the only cooperative play besides GvG matches) as well as an interesting story-driven campaign, IF (yes, if) you pay for the "ticket to the movie".\n\nSo yeah, you probably already have the idea that CrimeCraft is, for the most part, a money-driven game. A lot, if not all, of the features in the game require you to cough up the dough you earn in your life and not in-game. Don't get me wrong though, despite that, CrimeCraft is far from a "pay-to-win" game. Buying good equipment does not make you invincible or give you insane damage; it's still about reflex and skills.\n\nIf there are certain products that interest me (yes, I paid for CrimeCraft) it would be character customization options, but that's just me. The only reason I ever play CrimeCraft is the character customization and the PvE element.\n\nI would recommend this game, but as I said in my first sentence: only get it if you're not planning to treat it like a massively multiplayer online game, Get friends to play with you and treat it like a LAN game, but not a MMO.\n\nHikumi gives this game, a 5 out of 10.","April 12, 2015","true","32.1"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","22","38","8","0"

Don't trust it, just check CCGW out!\nCrimeCraft is great dinamic fan shooter, with cool mods. Yes, nowadays it's crisis time for it, but you can check it game out and start playing, so it comes out of it.\nIt has a few minuses: 1) Donation on high levels, it's not needed and lottery (donation stuff) isn't that cool, but many players are used to think it is. 2) Registration on mayngames.com may take you a huge time, but if you want to do it short, pls, add me to friendlist on steam, I finish your registration just for 2-3 minutes.\nAwesome benefits: 1) Daily and weekly tournaments. 2) Awesome char and weapon customization. 3) Territory Wars 4) Gang Wars. 5) 3 PvE gamemodes 6) Many pvp game modes 7) Classes 8) Custom profiles, you may do with your custom profiles everything you want!!

Unfortunately after a hefty download and patch, the game itself is pretty wonky and far from polished. The menus seem self explanatory, but entire sections are blocked off without being greyed out, and advertisements for real money purchases block your view and access to things you need. The game itself has about a 50% chance to alt-tab whenever you fire your gun if you have more than one monitor, and I have to unplug it just to play. The action itself is third person over the shoulder, like Gears of War or Lead and Gold; gameplay seems fun enough and promises some RPG crafting classes but be warned, you'd better be good at FPS because the heart of this game is PVP and I keep getting pwned the second I spawn. All in all, I get the feeling that Steam's other gang mmo, APB, is probably better in all regards to this one.\n\nSame Day Update: Wow...this game is just beyond terrible, don't waste your time. Not only can the random PVP matches have vastly different levels - oen guy who kept killing me was far, far higher - but your "level" is largely determined by how much money you spend on upgrades. This is the worst kind of game design.","December 15, 2011","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/recommended/38830/","YouthOfFreedom","+ Youth Of Freedom +","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YouthOfFreedom/","42 products in account","GAMEPLAY : 6.5/10\n\nCrimeCraft is basically a third person shooter MMO sets in an urban places.\n\nAs you start off the game,you're given to choose a server. Unfortunately there is only one and it have extremely few people playing it.\n\nOnce you choose that one server,you are given to create your own character.\n\nThe character creation is really really basic and lackluster giving you so little options to choose from.\n\nThere is a tutorial mode for you but since it a shooter game you wouldn't even need a tutorial to begin with if you familier playing a lot of shooter game.\n\nThe game is somewhat focus on PvE,at the same time it focus on PvP so it a balance between both.\n\nHowever you only find a maximum number of 50 people playing PvP and only like 10 people playing PvE because the game start to die slowly.\n\nThere is a class system in this game. Ranging from soldier,rockeeter,sniper and so on as you progress unto the game further. You also can create your own custom class too.\n\nGunplay in this game felt stiff and clunky. You can toggle between first & third person mode during combat mode.\n\nOne of the most fun factors about this game is that enemy,including you can be blown into pieces depending on the weapon you are using. So yeah basically this game has a gore system and it execute it very well.\n\nAside from that you can earn reputation throughout your playthrough but it seems to serve no purpose rather than going for high ranking in leaderboards.\n\nThere is a tournament too but you most likely stumble to a lot of high level players.\n\nGRAPHICS : 7/10\n\nConsidering the game came out in 2009,the graphics is pretty decent to say the least.\n\nThe urban/gangstar city look really great with some of the environment that look gritty which depict nicely how an urban city looked like.\n\nCharacter models,weapons & clothing don't looked like plastic so it pretty ok i guess.\n\nAUDIO : 6/10\n\nSound quality wise...is pretty acceptable.\n\nSome of the guns sounds felt like it have some impact on them though i find the voice acting to be hilariously bad and good at the same times.\n\nThe lack of ambience make the game less appealing since i felt the world to be quite dull & empty.\n\nLONG-LASTING APPEAL : 4/10\n\nDespite PvP having a lot of mode and the PvE missions is pretty long but somewhat repetitive with not many different kind of objectives,the games get extremely boring very fast mainly because there is not many people playing this game ( i believe ever since APB Reloaded released,a lot of them migrate to that game ).\n\nThere is goals and achievements you can achieve too but if the game contain less player playing,it doesn't matter.\n\nFINAL VERDICT : 5.9/10\n\nUnfortunately i can't recommend you to play this game. Why ? Because this game have some pay 2 win features in it and the less amount of people playing this game lower down any enjoyment you had with this game.\n\nThough if you like blowing people piece by piece and mostly for the gore factors,you could probably give it a try though.\n\nToo bad APB Reloaded overshadowed this game a lot otherwise i might find this game an enjoyable experience with many people playing it.

You can use your own Custom profile (character you created when beginning the game) as well as character classes (presets). Some examples would be Soldier, Chaingunner etc. You can also craft various items from clothing to weapons. There are many things to keep you busy while you're out of battle. You can create a gang as well as create a Hangout (decorating and upgrading). You can also visit other gang hangouts and explore or simply join someone elses gang. There is PvP, PvE and tournaments (16 game modes I believe). I really enjoy this game you can go in solo or with a team.","January 29, 2015","true","118.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

I run it on all high settings and its beautiful, its atmospheric and has a kind of Blade runner feel to the city, with a touch of Arkham city, you can play in third person or first person. I usually drift between the two as I like both. I think the campaign is worth it alone, cool story, feels like a game you would buy. At first its a little hard and may be confusing, but like most role playing games you need to level up, learn the ropes, get better gear etc. I would recommend doing the prologue as it helps you learn, adds to the feel of progressing. I'm really enjoying it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shooters, story, and roleplaying. You get a lot for free to play.

THIS MAYBE LONG/SHORT :D!\n\n\nSo, from reading some reviews I thought I'd throw one in. Please note this is from what the game used to be.(i.e 1-2years ago)\n\n\n\nSo... this game... let's just say, I loved the absolute  ♥♥♥♥♥ Sprinkle's out of this game. Yes you read that right  ♥♥♥♥♥ Sprinkle's. The concept was just amazing, the gameplay was right there with it, this wasn't just another TF2/CoD/Bf:4 ect. game this was something that as far as i know hasn't been tried before, It wasn't the best game ever but it wasn't remakes of popular game's.\n\nYou, maybe asking yourself "what was so good about this game?!" well, to put it shortly (TL;DR) it wasn't what it is today. Now last time I tried this game was maybe 4-7month's ago? and well... it was rather ♥♥♥♥ :/. The match making was ♥♥♥♥, the playerbase had been killed by 70-80%, AND I couldn't get into my original account. So, the  crafting of crime craft consisted of profesion's, now before you start lighting torches and getting pitch forks let me explain.(remember its been aloooooooong time since I actually played this game so forgive me if anything is wrong) Chemistry if I'm correct allowed you to make well drug's which weren't you're everyday "420 sn00p d0gg w33d" these actually did something besides making your brain hurt. Craftsman(can't remember the name) allowed you to make gun modification's, now you didn't have to use this to get good gun's you could just have bought the mods from players. And well... thats about the only two professions I remember.\n\n\nSo, that concludes my honest short/long review of this game. Some may have been rambling I do ever so say sorry for that, I have a bad habbit of it. But until next time this has been ~ CurrentOfLife's Honest Reviews!\n\n\n~~~~TL;DR~~~~ Game isn't what it used to be.","February 21, 2015","false","253.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I run it on all high settings and its beautiful, its atmospheric and has a kind of Blade runner feel to the city, with a touch of Arkham city, you can play in third person or first person. I usually drift between the two as I like both. I think the campaign is worth it alone, cool story, feels like a game you would buy. At first its a little hard and may be confusing, but like most role playing games you need to level up, learn the ropes, get better gear etc. I would recommend doing the prologue as it helps you learn, adds to the feel of progressing. I'm really enjoying it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys shooters, story, and roleplaying. You get a lot for free to play. I would use real money in this game just because I like it and would want to support it.","January 9, 2015","true","50.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't start counting how many annoying things have made me delete this game .\nLet's try to explain why the game is so utterly unplayable:\n\n01 - One of the most annoying , stupid and ridiculous thing that i hate in this game is level design on mission levels.\nWhy why why, there must be invisible wall in middle of the level blocking your ways??????? I can't count how many times i died because of invisible walls in the middle of the map. Yes in the middle!!!!!!! Why is there is beyond me.\n\n02 - Stupid customization system exist only to make spend real money for items that have no value whatsoever.\n\n03 - Pre made class characters is not customizable. For example if find/buy decent weapon or item you can't use on your pre-made class character and can only be used with custom characters (which suck very badly)\n\n04 - Lacking of any atmosphere in this game (like all multiplayer shooters). City maps is completely useless and only can waste your time and bring you big frustration. Why? I will explain. City feels like just a interactive menu . You need to go to different NPC to take mission/ or buy crafting or other useless items.\n\nThis however can be done almost instantly via game menu. So , city is pretty much useless. If you want to play mission, just click and chose the map & type of the game and you are good to go.\nYou don't need story, don't need NPC , you don't need to backtrack the boring and very dead atmospheric claustrophobic so called, OPEN WORLD CITY (nothing is open there) .\n\n05 - Lack of players . I feel like i was playing single player with very very bad design levels, no story line whatsoever and limited customization.\n\nThere is tons of more frustration in this game . I barely managed to put 2-3 hours of effort to like this game. But hell no.\n\nI strongly suggest: if you like good games, buy decent single player game and just enjoy. This is not single nor multiplayer game. It's complete waste of time.\n","March 8, 2015","false","5.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

It is definitely worth playing through the prolouge though, for it's singleplayer and storyline that most fps's lack. There is a distinctive class system, but you can't customize any of them except the soldier at the character creation sreen. You can buy a custom class, but it will have mismatched gear and only one ability unless you are willing to pay money. Overall, a good game, VERY average with no distinctive qualities and class systems, but worth playing for it's singleplayer.","January 18, 2014","true","37.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Don't be decieved by it being "free to play". If you want to enjoy this game you'll have to shell out at least a little money, or do those surveys for credits. The campaign is paid for, but it's okay. Story isn't very good, but the missions are fairly unique and fun. Graphics are decent, there are a few unique elements. Basically the combat in this, is how APB should have been. And APB has the free roam that this should have had. The cash shop is pretty cheap, the community is small, PVP is pretty easy. The game severely lacks in tutorials however, it's very confusing whether your ability is meant to heal you or buff your health for example. And the class system was changed around when I stopped playing, so it might have improved or worsened at this point. It's a pretty okay game, it doesn't do anything amazingly, a few thing were very poorly executed. Crafting for example, was horrible. 6.8/10","April 25, 2012","true","21.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I really liked it back then... but now there are rarely any players, and the only players that do play are pay2win/high leveled players... it had some really good potential but due to the lack of players... it's drawn back... I am sorry, I really like this game but it's population went downhill.\n\nand the title is a little misleading... "Crimecraft" yet there are only four proffessions, chemist, gunsmith and whatever the other two are... and if you actually wanna craft any of the good stuff you have to do a lot of continous crafting and buying ♥♥♥♥ off the auction to get the stuff you want... honestly, the only thing that's good for crafting is the proffession that makes bullets, with that you don't have to worry about losing ammo... if you plan to work on your custom character then the classes.\n\nThe pay2win on this is so bad, this game tries to force you into paying, everywhere you go... it tries every attempt to nickel your money.\n\nOther then that... the gameplay is suprisingly good, but like I said... I am afraid the game is just drawn back because of the community.","January 15, 2015","false","31.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing is possible as a free player and even if you do spend money on it, the gameplay is not worth it, it's not even fun.

It has pve, story based modes, pve game modes, pvp modes with many maps and game types.  However, due to the lack of moderation on this game it is sadly engulfed with players that cheat.  These players get away with it, and brag about it in game chat, plus they sell the cheats from in game chat!!!  There is a report cheat function include with the game, but as no one appears to take any notice of this, sadly, the cheating players rule the game.  The tournaments are alway won by the "pro" (cheating) teams, and the Territory Wars, 3 times a week are also usually won by the gangs that cheat.\n\nI would love to rate this game highly, as it has a huge amount of content, but until it is run properly, it is just a place where people can showcase their latest cheat hacks.\n\nIf more clean players would join this game (and not be put off by the idiots allowing their computers to do all the work for them) then this game would be fantastic.\n\nThe only thing letting it down is the "pay to play" aspect and the majority of players using cheat codes to play for them.\n\nAs a game, with its content and playability - I would recommend highly, as a game full of people using cheats and bypassing the terrible xtrap cheat detection (it kicks you for using fraps to capture cheaters but does not kick the people using cheats!!) I have to say, unless you are willing to be frustrated on a frequent basis, this game is one to be avoided.\n\nGamewise, it is excellent.  Management-wise, it leaves a lot to be desired and it is very clear that the current developers of this game are only there to make money from the pay to play players.\n\nI am very surprised to see this game available via Steam as I am aware of the dim view that Steam take on cheats and hackers.  I am very annoyed that I found this game via Steam and have been subjected to the verbal abuse, rascial abuse and blatant cheating that is prominent in this game.\n\nIf you want to change this - join the game, join a clean gang (to my knowledge, there is only one!) and keep sending report tickets about the cheating etc...\n\nI refuse to allow such a great game to be demolished by 12 year old children cheating and being abusive!!  Join me in my quest to get this game back on track!!","September 14, 2014","false","132.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

PVE content is decent but minimal(but there is some grinding to be had if you want to lvl a profession). PVP content is really great(The tournaments are awesome! Daily tournaments!!!) but gear is definitely a factor, Although there are certain availiable tactics that don't rely on gear. Cons: Many of the top PVPers are carried by gear bought from the item shop....so basically at the higher lvl of pvp...it's probably more gear based rather than skill. Although a skilled player with no gear can still get in the top 50 :) More cons: Not enough people play this game! Servers are frequently down for maintenance(but this has gotten a lot better now). Some things could also be designed better such as being able to right click things in your inventory while your at the bank to transfer them instead of clicking and dragging....or a mail feature to gather all items from all mails at one time. So if you're a shooter fan...who loves pvp i would recommend this game.\nEdit: Last time i played this game, there weren't enough people on the server to make it enjoyable; it might be different now, i don't know.","September 16, 2011","true","362.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But the only way I can recommend this game now is if the following things happen:\n\n1) P2W store (aka "Black Market") is removed. They should at least remove all the combat related gear anyways. The game has a great crafting system, auction house, and tournament reward system... the P2W store takes from all the good these things bring.\n\n2) There should be active moderators / dev team to address forum questions, enhance current game content, etc., and for the seldom times someone is blatantly hacking.","March 25, 2015","true","172.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Here is a link on how to help get it.\nWhen I got the achievement I restarted steam (just in case) and started up TF2, getting a message that I got a new hat.\n\nConclusion: With the good graphics, somewhat interesting but cliche plot, and arcade gameplay, I would recommend if you want to play in order to get a free TF2 hat and play with bots of various classes.","October 2, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Instead you get thru install, get thru registration, get thru the X-hack installer, get thru X-hack startup, get thru game startup, get thru char creation, get thru the loading, get started into you first map......... and it crashes hard core.  you get to rerun (not knowing there is a problem), let it rebuild, restart game, get thru x-hack again, get thru loading, get started into your first map (again) and it crashed hardcore again.  Around, and around turning settings down, or shutting other stuff down, until the 4th time, you get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and go to their support site......................... but oh wait this game isn't on their support site..........................  So you have to know to click on the forum, and inside the technical issues forum you find that the game doens't support Win10 and they have no idea when they will get it to run, even thou the OS has been out publically over a year and in betas long before that.\n\nIt looks like a good game, but until they can at least get caught up to the current OS, I have no choice but to give them a thumb down.  Maybe in 6 months they will have fixed it and I can give the game the proper review it deserves (hopefully MUCH better because it looks promising).","February 4","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know how to begin.. it's just so.. aagh.. Dis gem mek mi hed hurt.\n\nYou need to reach level 3 to be able to choose what kind of game you want to join... In case that didn't sound ridiculous enough: Believe it or not, you also need to be level 4 in order to access your friends list. You can't play with friends, until you've leveled until level 4 on your own. Also, after a buddy and I finally reached level 4 we added each other to our friends lists but couldn't find the requests anywhere. We've really tried, we looked everywhere we could think of... there's apparently no place that lets you accept your friend requests, or this game is just too smart for us. Also the bubbles telling you to buy new classes and spend all your hard earned cash on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you might end up never ever actually using are in front of half the rest of the menu, making it unclickable. You have to enter the last segment of the menu in order to be able to click any of the rest. That is great menu design! So you don't only have to unlock the friendslist and then figure out how to actually use it: You also have to figure out how to even click on it in the first place! Overall, the menu is so horrible, it's harder to understand than the game itself. It also told me to level up my classes without saying anything about what that is supposed to be good for... That starts out pretty cheap, but it gets very expensive very fast and I honestly haven't noticed any changes after leveling one class up a bit. To be fair, I did only level it up 2 times or so, it might get noticable at highter levels only, no clue. The gameplay actually wasn't too bad, but there's so many free to play shooters out there, most of them play pretty much exactly the same - usually better -, I really don't see why anyone would choose this out of all the options... Oh, you also can't jump. Spacebar is a dodge roll, which is actually a pretty neat feature, but really confusing if you're used to jumping. Changing weapons doesn't work with 1 and 2, but only with the mouse wheel and you throw a granade with F1, even though G, F, E, Q and all of the other buttons that would be so much more comfortable to press are unused. I really don't know what was going on in their minds when they layed out those controls..  I really don't know what was going on in their minds when they made any of this. Just.. why?\n\n\n\nBut it gave me a free Team Fortress 2 hat, so best game 10/10, made me look fab and all my friends be jelly. 👍","August 11, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't know how to begin.. it's just so.. aagh.. Dis gem mek mi hed hurt.\n\nYou need to reach level 3 to be able to choose what kind of game you want to join... In case that didn't sound ridiculous enough: Believe it or not, you also need to be level 4 in order to access your friends list. You can't play with friends, until you've leveled until level 4 on your own. Also, after a buddy and I finally reached level 4 we added each other to our friends lists but couldn't find the requests anywhere. We've really tried, we looked everywhere we could think of... there's apparently no place that lets you accept your friend requests, or this game is just too smart for us. Also the bubbles telling you to buy new classes and spend all your hard earned cash on ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you might end up never ever actually using are in front of half the rest of the menu, making it unclickable. You have to enter the last segment of the menu in order to be able to click any of the rest. That is great menu design! So you don't only have to unlock the friendslist and then figure out how to actually use it: You also have to figure out how to even click on it in the first place! Overall, the menu is so horrible, it's harder to understand than the game itself. It also told me to level up my classes without saying anything about what that is supposed to be good for... That starts out pretty cheap, but it gets very expensive very fast and I honestly haven't noticed any changes after leveling one class up a bit. To be fair, I did only level it up 2 times or so, it might get noticable at highter levels only, no clue. The gameplay actually wasn't too bad, but there's so many free to play shooters out there, most of them play pretty much exactly the same - usually better -, I really don't see why anyone would choose this out of all the options... Oh, you also can't jump. Spacebar is a dodge roll, which is actually a pretty neat feature, but really confusing if you're used to jumping. Changing weapons doesn't work with 1 and 2, but only with the mouse wheel and you throw a granade with F1, even though G, F, E, Q and all of the other buttons that would be so much more comfortable to press are unused. I really don't know what was going on in their minds when they layed out those controls..  I really don't know what was going on in their minds when they made any of this.

Its Pay to Win. Its full of cheaters and am so sad that the only thing free in this game is the uninstall button. This game was good before now its a piece of crap. Sadly the NEW devs dont give a ♥♥♥♥ about this game and they only add more stuff to the category Pay To Win... No wonder this game is free. This game has so horribly bad graphics. The combat sucks so bad that (1 look=1 suicide)... Btw the only characters you can play without paying real money are the first 5 classes... All other=Pay to win. Weapons are Pay to win too. THIS GAME IS A TOTAL PAY TO WIN !\n\nI rate this game: 3/10 (Its even alot for a game like this to be rated 3 anyone)","July 10, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Custom Classes are where the game really shines, and the use of abilities and boosts make for really entertaining gameplay with a diverse range of characters, all made for different styles of combat.\n\nEarly on a lot of people will struggle with the higher level players and the skills/abilities and boosts that they have, but these things are what makes the game enjoyable.  So grab a weapon, grab a boost and come play.","April 29, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
