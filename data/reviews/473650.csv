Qutiong James on what he said about me in my post "You have tampered with our sales enough so that none of our other games will get greenlit" WELL, this is a bit of an awakward moment for both u and your brother,isn't it?HOW MANY GAMES HAVE YOU GUYS MADE?! YOU'VE MADE MORE GAMES THAN ONE COMPANY MAKES WITHIN THE SPAN OF 10 YEARS. YOU'RE FILLING GREENLIGHT UP WITH YOUR SH*T! STOP IT! TAKE PRIDE AND CARE IN YOUR WORK BECAUSE THIS IS DEFINATELY NOT A WAY TO SHOW YOUR SO CALLED "PRIDE AND CARE."\n\nWyatt Derp, SORRY, Withering Kingdom: Arcane War is an action shooter made by my pals over at Digital Homicide, wait, what was that? They're called Digital Homicide Studios LLC. now? Ok. They've released a clone of Wyatt Derp basically and they don't even try to hide it, this is shameless. This game is surprisingly really bad. I thought nobody could make this sort of idea of a game bad. ALL YOU NEEDED TO DO WAS MAKE A SHOOTER WHERE YOU GO FROM SIDE TO SIDE SHOOTING THINGS, IS THAT TOO HARD TO DO?! This game gets boring fast because of A) the amount of bugs that are in this and B) how easy the bugs make the game.\n\nI ended up shooting an enemy s hard, a cowboy came flying out of them. GEE, I wonder if that has anything to do with the fact that this is a F*CKING WYATT DERP CLONE! The enemies also usually glitch out when they're dead, these glitches include the bodies falling through the ground, body parts stretching out, bobbing up and down and being slingshot to the other end of the map.\n\nThings get better. The AI programming is f*cked up. The game doesn't move on levels when you kill all of the enemies that are on the screen, the game moves on when you stop shooting. There can be 30 enemies on the screen and the game will just move on if you just stop shooting.\n\nI also received 2 game crashes with just 10 mins of gameplay and if I can list out those problems with just 10 mins of gameplay on Steam and 10 mins on itch.io, you have a problem with your game.\n\nPros\n+ Decent graphics (especially by Digi Hom games)\n\nCons\n- Boring\n- Easy\n- Lots of bugs\n- Terrible AI\n\nFinal verdict: 2/10\n\nSteam curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","May 27","false","0.4"," 70 of 77 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","70","77","7","18"

This game came out as part of Digital Homicide's May 27th "Release 5 games at once" spree, and from what I've read, it's an exact clone of Wyatt Derp (WK is the only one I decided to purchase to try and play). Withering Kingdom features absolutely no main menu screen, immediately dumping you into the game with no explanation as to what the controls are. Expect to be clicking your left mouse key a lot to do your shooting and praying that the hits actually hit.\n\nThe game is a mess. The upgrades (from what I could tell) didn't actually seem to do anything. The enemy models glitch out a lot, and according to another review the alien part of them can even fly off to reveal a cowboy underneath (gee). There is MINOR controller support, but by minor I mean you can move and open up the upgrade menu.\n\nAvoid this game. It's a mess, the character models bug out, and the hitboxes seem to be all over the place.","May 27","false","0.8"," 50 of 52 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","50","52","2","0"

As shwon in my video, this is one of multiple instances of Digital Homicide's re-skinning video games and re-selling them as new titles. Withering Kingdom and Withering Kingdom 2 are the exact same game with a camera angle change. It is also a reskin of Wyatt Derp and Wyatt Derp 2, along with Krog Wars. The conveyor belt of crap continues as they don't even bother to flip different assets. Why bother when you can simply slap another skin on it and sell it as a new game!\n\nSeriously. Avoid this crap at all costs.\n\nIf you are interested in seeing what I'm talking about, see my report here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h532IZSEQA","May 27","false","1.1"," 48 of 50 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","48","50","0","0"

Avoid at all costs.\n\nEdit: The reloading sound effect from Wyatt Derp/WD2 is used for reloading your staff.\n\nJust sayin'","May 28","false","0.1"," 38 of 40 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","38","40","2","0"

RMB fires your shotgun I mean other magical power. You can stand in one place shooting and progress the game, enemies will pool on either side of your "lane" and keep firing their attacks in straight lines right past you. The enemies became so clogged on my screen that I experienced lag I don't experience in AAA titles. Nothing about this game is inspired, original, or fun. It is another piece of trash, a reskin of Wyatt Derp/Krog Wars, probably another asset flip from Digi Hom.

Every level is the same.  What you see in the video on the Store page is all that happens in the entire game.\nLeft, right, fire, duck and "cast spells" are the only actions.\nControls cannot be redefined.\nNo customization.  No settings of any kind, not even one to start a new game.\nAt the time of this review,  only one of the four positive reviews has any comment at all. And it consists of a single blurb, made by another game studio with a private profile.\nRidiculously taxing on your CPU, even on low settings, especially in later levels where there is more activity on the screen.  (This is not to say that these levels are in any way more complicated, challenging, or fun than those previous.)\nA…¥·¥Ö M·¥ès·¥õ P·¥Ä·¥õ ú·¥á·¥õ…™·¥Ñ O“ì A ü ü: You cannot aim at enemies, and likewise, they have no ability to target you.  They fire straight in front of them, regardless of your position.  You can literally stand in the middle, right where you start, and press fire repeatedly.  Any enemy in front of you will be mowed down, and all the other enemies will stand bunched up firing straight ahead, never hitting you.  You'll be told you've passed level after level, and all the enemies are still there and remain there forever.  When a boss level comes, he too can be defeated by just standing there firing.  He'll walk back and forth, in and out of your firing line and eventually die.  I'm totally serious.  I tried to record a video of it but it's so CPU intensive that I couldn't get a good copy.  But  here is a screenshot[imgur.com] of me fighting the first boss, having gotten there by pressing only fire; no move, no duck, no spells.  Defeated him.  Never took a single hit of damage.  No joke.Absolutely worthless excuse for a game.  And absolutely no surprise to see it was made by Digital Homicide.  Worthless is what they do best.\n\n0/10","June 2","false","3.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
