There's hope for this game yet, but I still cannot recommend it until said changes are implemented. Review below:\n\nCongratulations, developers. You just shot your own game in the foot and alienated your loyal playerbase all in one swoop. So much for 'help us make the game you want to play.'\n\nI have played more than one thousand hours on this game between the Patton Build and the Churchill build, and loved it.\n\nI have played TWO games post - Devyatayev update and now hate it.\n\nBefore the update you were free to switch between any class you owned on the battlefield provided the resource is available.\n\nEnemy paratrooper planes spotted? No problem, switch to a Fighter Pilot and take them down.\n\nEnemies are swarming the last objective? No worries, I have another Infantryman with an SMG.\n\nRunning out of Infantry? No issue, we have paratroopers.\n\n\nNow, what can we do with the game next? Oh yeah, almost completely disable that feature. Now, if you join a battle alone you are stuck with playing that class for the entirety of that game, and even if  you join with your own squad you are severely restricted on doing this.\n\nIn other words, you can't join as any soldier other than an infantryman for fear that your team may need an Infantryman, who are, after all, the players that do the majority of capturing and defending. Our team is losing our final objective? I wonder why, oh yeah, everyone is either a pilot or tank commander and cannot switch to their own infantrymen because of this update.\n\nTo add insult to injury, players that join a match without a squad are now forced into one – one person of which is made the squad leader. Which probably means you'll have some low-rank soldier who doesn't really have the knowledge or expertise as of yet to command directing you for at least one-quarter of your games. Not saying this is necessarily bad, but having a Pilot ordering me to get out of my plane and capture an objective is not on. And then he kicked me from his squad – something he has the power to do - meaning I don't share in any of the bonuses for following 'orders' etc. Great way of making players feel even more alone on the battlefield, rather than making them feel less alone.\n\nAnother instance of the following orders stupidity is if I am playing as my anti-tank Infantryman, which if I continued playing this game I would probably do since I cannot switch to my Tanker mid-game, so I would have to deal with tanks that way. But I cannot capture an objective using mines and a bazooka, which I will inevitably get ordered to do since the new squad leader system rewards players who spam commands. In the eyes of an observer, I will probably look like a selfish pig who doesn't want to assist my team, when it is completely the opposite.\n\nYou can avoid this system partially by forming your own squad pre-match with friends, provided any of them still play after this update. Doing so gives you the bonus of knowing you won't end up under the command of some new player who really should be following rather than leading due to inexperience.\n\nThe squad system used to be that you could recruit up to 5 of your friends to play as a squad, provided they all have a character of that class, e.g. German Pilot. You would be then free to switch between characters mid-battle, so if there were no enemy fighters you were a bit useless and likely to switch to Infantry to assist your team better.\n\nNow, we have the 'new and improved' Squad 2.0. It means that the number of people you can have in a squad is cut in half to 3 for infantry, the largest squad. But you can pay/grind even more (the grind was bad enough beforehand) to unlock more squad points to pay for a bigger squad, again up to 6 by using up to 10 of your 12 points to add more members to your squad, leaving none left to customise it any other way.\n\nHowever, you can now add 'auxiliary seats' to your squad, meaning that one person at once can change to the class of that seat, adding up to 3 of these seats. This means that the team will probably spend more time arguing about who gets to use the auxiliary seat than playing the game, something I have already seen happening on the first day after the update. It also means whichever player changes to that class will be under constant pressure from his own team to do well at that class, as they cannot change to it themselves.\n\nIt's such a shame to see such a good thing get killed off instantly by one update. And I haven't even talked about all the other bad things in the D build – the new Squad system alone is enough to make my blood boil. In its current state, the game is a waste of storage space, which is why I've uninstalled it.\n\nRIP Heroes and Generals, 11th July 2014 - 25th May 2016","May 25","false","083.0"," 462 of 497 people (93%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","93","462","497","19","42"

Even if you're playing with friends. Even if you want to spend money on it. DO NOT DO IT. This kind of game CANNOT BE SUPPORTED.\n\nWith the latest patch, people who do not outright buy weapons and equipment have to grind 300-400% longer for their gear. You need thousands upon thousands of hours to buy the equipment needed to even compete in this game now. Reto, the company who develops this game, admits their intention to make it impossible to get gear other than to spend money on it and offer NO EXPLANATION OR JUSTIFICATION outside of that. They are basically admitting to treating the majority of their consumers like dirt and are not even trying to shy away from that fact. They know it, they know that we know it, but all they care about is $$$.\n\nBasically, the biggest slap in the face you can imagine. Not even EA can match this level of dastardly.\n\nThis kind of behavior is unacceptable and other developers needs to know this kind of attitude towards customers and consumers is UNACCEPTABLE.

Pretty fun when done with friend. Driving like crazy on motobike to tank from behind then planting anti-tank granades and watching it blow.\nThen we both got suddendly banned for "farming experiencepoitnts". My first thought was what's going on?! Checked email. There was no email, no warning, just instant perma ban on account. I wrote to support, got message back that I violated Terms of Use, because we were farming experience points... And that's being treated by them on same as cheaters are... That's ridicolous...\nFirst thing, I'm Polish and I read entire translated polish ToS before even starting to play this game. I usually do when playing multiplayer games. I have found none entry about "farming experience" in any part of it. Nowhere. Checked again after ban. Not a single entry.\nSecond thing, how can you be so arbitraty to ban PERMAMENTLY, without any warning or leisser punishment, without proper information on email, players that are playing to grind in F2P game? Since when playing to grind became considered by any community (of players, not of devs) considered to be bad thing? They created a model that you can for fee of in-game real-money currency pay to get grind quicker, so it hurts them when someone does grind and they ban him. That stands for pretty pathetic, arbitrary dev. Problem of players grinding could be solved in diffrent, more friendly to consumer way instead of banning peps, when you don't like their own worked solution to grind in poorly designed system.\nGood game 7/10, Devs -3/10, total 2/10.

That will be awesome!" I started playing a map and suddenly these brand new Soviet characters were charging down the field like an unstoppable beast, capturing all of the points and one-shotting all of my teammates. Map after map, it was the brand new Soviet characters winning.\n\nIf they were just added to the game, how are they outperforming players that have been playing for a year?!?!\n\nThe answer is that the newest update has really leveraged the pay to win, and most of the soviet teams' characters were bought with real money as an "Academy - Trained Character." Academy trained is basically a cheat code to bypass INSANE amounts of play time. I didn't mind the veteran accounts and the booster ribbons for boosting XP. Sure, that's p2w too, but this new advantage for payers is just ridiculous. It's not even fun to play anymore.\n\nI'm not one of those anti-profit people, but there is a balance. The devs essentially are pushing away a huge portion of their fan base that has been playing for a long time because now they're getting their butts kicked by noobs with a credit card.\n\nI gave this game my enthusastic recommendation and time, but now I'm going back to change it.

I hate that rather than fix something or make it the best they can (e.g. Tanks) the devs just introduce more of said broken item.\n\n5. I hate that after 3 years+ of development we still have one campaign, guns sound like they are firing paintballs, tanks flip when running into bicycles and come to a complete stop when hitting a simple wooden fence and much more.\n\n6. I hate that maps are so big and empty with no ambiance, no destruction and nothing that makes me remotely think I'm in a war.\n\n7. I hate the new weight system and how totally absurd it is (a grease gun weighing as much as a Thompson, a scoped Kar 98 weighing less than a regular Kar 98)\n\n8.

GAME RUN BY EXTREMELY FRAUDALENT & SCUMMY & TOXIC DEVELOPERS!\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\nSome small part of me as a previous fanboy of this game wished that all of the current controversy and bad rumors that's currently going around this game and the company behind it wasn't true. The most prominent eye-opener for me in this case was when I found out that the developers are shrugging at the people dedicating themselves to extensively griefing people and pushing them under the rug category as "minor trolls" without taking any action: http://imgur.com/a/s4uuA and permanently banning people on the forums for trying to blow the whistle on this fact: http://i.imgur.com/H2M1KPq.jpg (See http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097940740/recommended/227940/)\n\nYes, that's right. Someone posting in the FORUMS and leaving a NEGATIVE game review got his IN-GAME account PERMANENTLY BANNED without actually doing anything against the ToS IN THE GAME ITSELF.\n\nI did some further digging and oh boy do these guys commit themselves to doing some shady cràp, especially in the topic of the buy-able ingame currency known as gold. I've asked a few friends about it too and almost everyone who bought gold (or thought about it) has seen the prices for them constantly change and swap around, after not long, I came across this image: http://i.imgur.com/yut1Wkj.jpg\n\nWhich I traced back to this Reddit thread that has tons of people all being the victim (and observers) of the same thing, Reto-Moto changing and swapping the prices around, paying little to no heed as to just what country you are in unless the currency is worth more along with the prices themselves changing without notice: https://www.reddit.com/r/HeroesandGenerals/comments/3k8bnz/hg_gold_prices_same_country_different_account_wtf/\n\n"Huh".

The few Steam forum posts I've seen him make can only help me draw the conclusion that he is an extremely toxic, arrogant and sadistic individual that is doing his very best to shìtsmear, indiscriminatively perma-ban and push anyone off the rails who is even marginally thinking about giving the company he works for and/or their game Heroes & Generals some form of criticism or negative feedback, one way or another: http://imgur.com/MQ0itdm\n\nHe also has a view that can only be seen as over-zealous when It comes to their anticheat system where he has essentially taken the stance of it being 100% fool-proof with no false positives even being in the realms of a tangible possibility: http://imgur.com/9HCKOjr\n\nBut the most shocking point for me was how much of a small portion of the community knew what was going on as I kept finding more and more proof of just what kind of ship they were running: http://imgur.com/AVHxx1j\n\nEventually, I came across this wordpress page: https://amonsul1155.wordpress.com/2015/03/23/hello-world/\n\nAnd holy cràp.

The shooting mechanics feel solid, and the infantry weapons are fun to use. Jumping into a game as a tanker is incredibly fun and tank combat feels interesting and rewarding. And if you join into a game with a couple friends, you can have an awesome multiplayer experience that reminds me of the fun I had with early Call of Duty and Battlefield games.\n\nIt all falls apart when you actually try to start unlocking new classes, equipment, weapons, and vehicles. The level of grind required just to level up becomes exceedingly tiresome, and it only gets worse when you look at the costs you're required to pay to then make use of that leveling up. You're expected to save several hundred games worth of credits for a single new item, and that's not considering the maintenance costs you pay for repairs and rearming.\n\nThat issue has a rippling effect on the rest of the game, as it is not uncommon to get into games that are quite simply impossible to win. A not-insignificant number of my games have been in situations where my team is a bunch of dudes with rifles against enemy tanks, planes, and soldiers with overpoweringly strong weapons. Since I've played a bit and managed to get a second character that is a tanker things have gotten a bit better, but I will still run into situations where it is hopeless as I'm a light tank against medium and heavy tanks, or the enemy has uncontested air superiority and bomb me whenever I try to push forward.\n\nI sincerely hope the developers pay attention to these reviews, because this game can easily be made into something incredible with some simple changes to the leveling and in-game currency requirements.

But at first it didn't seems to bad the immersion was excellent and I enjoyed hitching rides on player's jeeps to the front line where I would hold the building against the other team (that part I enjoyed most) The best part was the P2W aspect wasn't bothering me too much. Sure the fact we had to buy our own ammo let alone weapons was annoying (not really accurate). But it wasn't to bad at the moment I was actually thinking of giving a positive reveiw on this maybe even an 9/10.\n\nThen I reached level 3.\n\nI tried out the new modes that were unlocked for me and I was thrown into an unbalanced, annoying, unfun game of who-paid-the-most. Crushed by tanks, head shotted from superb snipers. Sprayed by suprieor weapons. I couldn't defend myself since what good is a MP34 against a one-shotting Soviet Anti-Tank Rifle? (also I'm pretty sure that useing such a weapon against infantry is banned by the Geneva convention) I just simply wasn't ready for the ♥♥♥♥♥torm of advanced players after level 3. What is also annoying AF is the lack of communication abilties among your teamates. If i've cornered by 5 guys and need to request help. There is no time to press t and type *need help at X2* because they would've sprayed you by then. Since there is no voice chat in the game. Another complait I have is the combat in general, it feels clunky slightly better than DayZ, but still clunky.\n\nThen there is the biggest complaint of all from not just me, but from multiple people! The god-awful, rage-inducing, hair-pulling, life shortening, Pay 2 Win system. It's simple, if you don't pay, you gotta grind for hours upon hours just for a new gun! In the amount of time I played, I still just have a MP34. And whats even worse is when your creamed by some guy with the best weapons in the game who just forked over some cash.\n\nThis is why this game cannot be reccomended at all to the great people of steam. I would give it a 1/10 thanks to the semi-helpful community. But I give a 9/10 to the game before you reach level 3.\n\n(another thing that will truely ♥♥♥♥ you off is the number of people *especially when playing the soviet faction* who people use anti-tank weapons against infantry *a certain one-hit kill*)\n\nAnother thing I think this game could have is a humans VS bots system, I can't be the only one who likes a little practise system when PvP gets to be too much. It would certainly keep me coming back. I know it's possible because of the tutorial segment of the game. I can't be the only one who likes to destroy bots every now and then\n\n*edit* The new update from what I can tell, makes the P2W even worse, now you can pay to level up your ribbions!\n\n*more edit* now you cannot deny that is it P2W since now the devs have raised the price of everything again! the weapons are crazy expensive, the mp40 is now over 100,000 credits, the kar 98 is no better, 89,000 credits. even the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mp34 is 45,000 credits! really?\n\n*even more edit* As suggested by D3uterzx, the main reason why each game is who-has-the-most-tanks, is because the weapons required for infantry to get rid of them is extremly expensive with some poor souls racking up thousands in costs and making it worth it more to simply leave the game and wait for it to end.\n\nXYLANDER UPDATE:\n\nI came back to the game after I saw that A new update came out. I check out all of it's new features and frankly, all the previous issues were still there. However, I must say that for some reason, the war games i played were much more fun than when I played on staged servers. Possibly because EVERY match wasn't spawncamped by tanks (because there weren't tanks or not that many. And for the first time since lvl 3, I actually had fun in war mode. The 50% more XP was also a bonus.\n\nBut an issue that came with war are the long queue times. Never in my life have i waited HALF AN HOUR to get into a game. Only for it to be almost over. It just needs to be fixed\n\nThe new credit system, make more as you play sounds good, got me interested. Maybe its becasue im only rank 6, but I'm still making around 5,000-6,000 a match. So, no differece there.\n\nThe battle Director, that seemed like the next best thing since sliced bread. Reto is probaly gonna tweak it anyway. But for me i got matches with respawns such as 200 my team v 5,000 spawns on other team. great idea though.\n\nBasicly, as of now, same game as last time.\n\nPS can RETO please do something about the OHK rifles everyones running around with? It's just annoying","July 2, 2015","false","87.2"," 571 of 708 people (81%) found this review helpful 73 people found this review funny","81","571","708","73","91"

I've spent over 100+ hours in this game.\nIt started as a cool concept but unfortunately it turned out to be bad. First of all I really wanted this game to be good (and in some cases it is) i love concept of WW2 FPS.\nUnfortunately there are tons of problems!\nGame is clearly pay to win. The amount of money you earn after a battle is so little it barely is enough for fixing and ammmunition. So in the end it's incredible grind fest to get a single weapon in this game (prizes of weapons are ridicolous).\nSecondly the level progress is also painfully slow. Recently they changed lvl exp caps and it's almost impossible for newbies to reach high levels (beside no-lifing or paying ofc)\nMoreover there is another problem!!! So you work your way to the 9th lvl or so and want to become sniper (all in all you were one-shoted so many times by high lvl, full gear players so you want revange) so you pay for becoming sniper AND THAN you have to buy a SNIPER RIFLE for like 150k ingame money. What THE ♥♥♥♥ is that. You paid to be a sniper and you have to additionally buy a sniper rifle in order to play it!?!?!? and 150k is a loooot of money if you don't wnat to pay real money.\n\nAND the balance of the game... even in staged battles which were supposed to be well "staged" and equal to every side. You end up being slaughtered buy 5 tanks when there is no tank-driver player in your squad!!! or you're constantly bombed by pilots cuz there is nobody to take it down.\n\nLastly... optimalization is a joke. My PC can easily run BF4 on high with decent fps ( close to 60). Not this game. And I'm pretty sure it looks way worse and mechanics are simpler...\n\nALL IN ALL there are some positives. Some matches are fun, When teams are balanced it's a satisfactory game. But there are just waay to many bugs, P2W mechanics and bad optimalization.\n\nJust don't waste your time!!!","May 31, 2015","false","44.9"," 341 of 413 people (83%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","83","341","413","8","19"

The ability to actually hide in bushes, no big name tags over enemy heads giving away the hiding spot, camo working the way it does in real life, making you hard to see.  The leveling system WAS pretty cool ranking up ribbons and gaining levels to unlock new class like tanker and paratrooper all the way to general. And of course the persistent war that was run by players at officer level allocating resources and assault teams to be fought out by the players.  I liked the no third person view in a tank but being forced to see through the vision slit, or pop your head out of the turret hatch for a better look and pray nobody popped ya...\n\nThe game gave way, WAY more xp for capturing and holding control points rather then kills and the plenty of  ribbon upgrades (that unlock all the vehicles, weapon mods, and special traits) that were not tied directly to combat would gain xp by you doing smart things in the game, like moving slowly, crouching, picking up teamates in transport vehicles, sprinting etc...It was a nice blend of realism and fun with plenty to do.  The grind was pretty steep, but it did not bother me to badly, I was unlocking things at a nice pace and was enjoying the game so much I paid money to unlock the Tiger I and bought a 30 day "premium" account.\n\nThen they destroyed it.  Unannounced and buried in the patch notes as "Ribbon drivers adjusted" and mentioned NO WHERE else was  a 75% NERF to ALL XP GAINS!!!  The game was already a steep grind, now, its damn near pointless to play.  There are about 35 ribbons, all of which unlock things in game, and the estimate given by the developer was "200 hours of game to max out ONE stinking ribbon..."  also, ribbons are not shared between your characters, so your tanker, your pilot , your para-trooper have to grind them all individually....Not to mentions there are three nations and nothing gets transferred between those either...\n\nI've never felt so spit upon by a developer before, seriously, I've never cared to write a review before, but folks, I gotta tell ya the sad truth, this is a  game with a ton of potential, and some unique and fun qualities, but I would NOT recommend starting the game as new player now, you are gonna face nothing but players with almost/all unlocks already completed and you will be in for a grind of, literally, THOUSANDS of hours before you are even competative.  Which means you won't have any fun playing the games biggest draw the "war" until then as well...\n\nGo play world of tanks, war thunder or red orchestra 2 instead....what a shame...","June 4, 2015","false","79.3"," 298 of 360 people (83%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","83","298","360","9","13"

There's a double-dip grind that players are forced to endure if they want to see ANY semblance of variety or nuance in their gameplay. First, players have to grind experience to unlock ranks which grant access to different roles, weapons, vehicles, and gear. This grind makes a snail's pace look blazing fast by comparison. So, a new player will basically be stuck with the same bottom tier weapons, in the same role, with the same bottom tier gear, for a very, very long time.\n\nOn top of that, there is the ribbon system grind that consists of weapon/gear-specific grinding--the more you use a particular weapon, for instance, the more experience you will get for that weapon's respective ribbon. This applies to every weapon, and every vehicle. This is how you unlock mods for that weapon/vehicle. This grind isn't the worst on its own, but it does still contribute to the overall barrier to entry.\n\nNext, there's the credit grind. Your credit earnings scale with your rank; the higher your rank, the more credits you get per match. Everything costs credits--weapons, mods, vehicles, grenades, gear, promotions, new soldiers, etc. And it's all very, very expensive relative to your earnings. What's more, all your gear, including your weapon mods, incurs repair costs for even the smallest of uses, and ammo needs to be replenished constantly. This means your already pathetic credit earnings are going to be even less rewarding the more you actually participate in a given match. A game that penalizes you for playing--novel idea. And there's no meaningful way to earn credit bonuses for playing well--like, if you get a crap-ton of kills and minimal deaths in a match, it doesn't matter. In fact, all that means is you used your weapon a lot, and expended a lot of ammo, so it probably ended up costing you more in the long run.\n\nAll of this combined produces a slow, tedious, monotonous, unrewarding, unsatisfying experience to say the very least. Meanwhile, you'll be enduring all of this on the same handful of rather poorly designed maps (they don't even have spawn-camp-protection integrated into the map design, and you will be spawn camped fairly often), with virtually no variety in the gameplay. You'll be put into regularly imbalanced teams where one side has more players than the other, which means the matches tend to be incredibly one-sided, and over befoer you have a chance to do much of anything. You'll be against players that have access to more and better gear options because they've payed for them, and/or have been playing much longer. It's simply not fun 9 matches out of 10, and what fun there is in that 10th match isn't even that great.\n\nIn addition the graphical fidelity is poor--the game looks dated, and the aesthetic quality is severely lacking--everything is faded, dull, drab, grey, unimpressive at best and a strain on the eyes at worst.\n\nThe sound quality also sucks quite a bit. The only half-decent sound effect in the game is the character's whistle. Guns sound nothing like guns. Explosions sound distorted and muffled. Vehicles sound like lawnmowers inside of tin cans. It's simply all bad.\n\nThe game also doesn't handle or feel very good. Jumping feels as though you're jumping on the moon. You can only sprint for about 2 seconds before you inexplicably run out of breath. Getting stuck on hidden collision geometry is common. Vehicle handling is ♥♥♥♥-poor. Firing on a moving target is an exercise in frustration because of the way hit detection works. You can literally have someone standing right in front of you, shoot them point blank and inexplicably miss because they were strafing to the side, and the netcode sucks. Also, if you and the enemy shoot each other at the same time, your shot will often never go off or be recognized by the game.\n\nAnd the list just keeps going, and going.\n\nIn summation, overall this game is garbage, and over the months it hasn't shown any signs of improving in any substantial way.","August 15, 2015","false","60.9"," 527 of 667 people (79%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","79","527","667","17","13"

Even if he doesn't have insta death grenades his mate can kill you with rockets.\nIf you play for the soviets you can't even use your MG or your main gun as the gun does not depress enough to hit anything, I think the soviet faction is just designed for target practice for both US and German tanks.\nI almost forgot, the opposition can also position their tanks where you spawn and kill you before you can react,  Oh and my personal favourite, put mines where you spawn so you die instantly.\n\nPlanes.\n\nNow this can be fun because all the planes have plus's and minus that make them fun to play.  the down side is there is a broken mechanic that allows more senior players to load HE into their planes that will instantly kill any pilot.  The controls are funky but this aids to the game play as it kind of restricts what you can do.\nLots of players like to camp spawns as well, as you can fly behind the preset spawn points for planes. Don't forget you can play like an ace and knock down loads of planes but it only takes 1 spam shot from the other side of the map to end your fun.\n\nParatroopers.\n\nYou spawn in a plane which 9 times out of 10 is either being shot down or about to be shot down.  You jump out and unless you use the free fall badge, which allows you to open your shoot 2 foot above the ground you are just target practice.  You can load up with anti tank stuff and blow up tanks with ought ever being seen as well.\n\nRecon.\n\nThis class has some fun toys as in armoured cars and you also get an 8 times scope.  You also get a good dose of Parkinson's disease now as your scope never stays still.\nInfantry.\nYou can have every type of gun or hand grenade or rocket and none of it matters unless you have heavy set gold which is the only way you will not die after the first bullet is fired.   It also has the most random cone fire system ever developed.\n\nThe player Base.\n\nSame as any other game you have some good some bad but as time goes by you realise there are 3 distinct types of player.\n\nThe Soviets; 		 bar room fighters\nThe US;			have the best weapons\nThe Germans;		actually have all the best weapons but swear blind the US  does\n\nThe game.\n\nUsed to be visually pleasing now is like 50 shades of grey with a "unhappy Ending" in every dark area.  If you like camping it's the game for you.  If you like unfair fights it's the game for you, if you like to pay for the good stuff, it's the game for you.\nI still come back to the game but I have a couple of thousand hours in it, everyone of my friends has stopped playing it a long time ago.  But to be true there comes to point when you have all of the players and all of the toys you are only really staying to support a faction but even then whats the point?\n\nHistory and My Thoughts\n\nThe game was amazing  fun maps with mountains, cover where you needed it but not too much, guns that mad sense in the way they fired and the type they were.  Realistic grinds for new stuff,  now it's just a grind fest.\nThey say we are a "Toxic Community" on the forums but in reality we are just so ignored by the developers its untrue the game by design is brilliant. inspired, fun but Reto over the last 2 years have systematically money grabbed and turned to the dark side.\n\nNow for me it's not immersing myself in a great WWII game it's like looking into a bucket of ♥♥♥♥ on my desk.\n\nBut I still play it go figure????\n\n\n","May 11","false","714.1"," 251 of 304 people (83%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","83","251","304","45","11"

The infantry combat is quite solid.\n\nThen you hit level three.  Now there are bigger maps.  They feel a bit like a slog, but it's nice to mix it up and maybe it'll be cool to see the vehicles in play.  Then you hit the tanks, and make a bunch of really unpleasant realizations.\n\nFirst, if you've been using your grenades, you probably have the RPG.  Great- it'll be nice to be able to defend yourself against any tanks that you can get close enough to, right?\n\nSo, you try to equip it and realize that the equipment carrying limit is so low that you can carry exactly your rifle and the RPG, and nothing else- no grenades, no SMG, etc.\n\nThat's fine... except you also can't swap loadouts mid-battle.  So, you either need to commit to a loadout that'll leave you at a disadvantage over much of the now rather long battles.  More problematically, if your team collectively doesn't have enough anti-tank firepower to deal with the enemy you can't do anything about it without leaving the battle.\n\nOne thing you personally can do is buy multiple characters, and then- here's the real problem- level up and equip each of them.\n\nI'd happily pay $5/loadout to unlock some more loadouts.  F2P developers need to get paid somehow, after all.  However, I'm not going to commit to going through the entire F2P grind and economy for each loadout I want to be able to field in a battle.\n\nAlso, that RPG you unlocked?  Each shell costs 710 credits.  At level 3, you're making something like 1500 credits per battle.  On the first battle where I managed to get into RPG-ish range with tanks I racked up over 5000 credits worth of ammunition costs getting one tank kill and some damage.  Bit of a price tag, that.\n\nThis, incidentally, also only got me about 1/50 of the way towards unlocking the first of the AT grenade/mine line, which are weapons I could carry in my inventory and still have room to swap out my rifle for an SMG or carry some grenades or do something else.  So much for that plan.  I'm neither willing to grind nor pay for that.\n\nSo, maybe you try being a tank crew instead- you can convert your infantryman into a tanker at this point.  Alternately, you could pay to buy a second pre-trained tanker.\n\nYour first tank?  It's got a machine gun as its weapon.  You can kill other people in their first tank, but you're mostly just fodder for people who have ground or paid their way up to higher tier tanks.  Definitely rubs the progression in your face in a bad way.\n\nUnsurprisingly, with all of these factors combining, it's not that hard to find yourself fighting a better-armored enemy and not being able to do anything about it.\n\nThe larger maps are also something of a tedious slog to play and should be revisited, and the prevalence of huge open fields and- especially- narrow bridge chokepoints also accentuates the badness of the tank system heavily.\n\nIt's also worth noting you're paying credits for both ammunition and repairs on all your gear each match.  For those first couple of levels, this doesn't seem like a big deal, but I assume it'll scale up ala other F2P games so that at higher levels you need to choose between using lower level gear or paying real money to be able to afford ammo and repairs.  Not necessarily the end of the world- I'm a big fan of World of Tanks which uses the same system- but what I've seen of the game so far leaves me no trust or interest in getting further and discovering what else H&G has to offer.\n\nThere's the core of a really good game here.  The infantry combat is good fun, and some of the Battlefield-esque chaos the infantry, gear, and vehicles can produce can shine through.  However, the bigger maps/missions need work and everything related to armored combat is an unenjoyable mess that rubs the need to invest more time and money into the game in your face.","March 27, 2015","false","6.6"," 461 of 587 people (79%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","79","461","587","34","28"

This game was a great concept. It WAS great, too, until the devs screwed with it too much.\nI hadn't played since sometime last year, and back then it was relatively easy (in comparison to now) to grind out enough XP over a few days of dedicated playing to buy a tank or a weapon.\n\nNow? Jesus.\n\nThe devs have made this game entirely pay-to-win, and it's damned near impossible to buy new gear. You get just enough cash to scrape by and repair your equipment. It would take weeks and weeks to achieve what I had been able to achieve in a few days a year ago. The people who pay real money (which I cannot) are speeding around with shiny top of the line tanks and amazing firearms while I'm still rooting around in the dirt with an m1 Garand.

Not community, not ease of access, nothing except the cash rolling in from people that can afford to buy things.\n\nMy advice to the devs (if they even look at the steam reviews- there's hundreds of more like mine) is either decrease weapon maintenance or multiply the XP players recieve.

However, now that the game is somewhat popular, the devs have jacked the prices for everything way up. They doubled weapons, vehicle, modification, and repair prices, and they made XP collection an absolute nightmare. Unless, of course, you want to pay. It's very easy to tell who pays and who doesn't, because the people who pay are the ones who are driving around in heavy tanks, or running around blasting people with unbelievably OP guns, while the people who don't pay are the ones who get turned to hamburger by those who do.

It's a wallet warrior's dream, but for those looking for an actual game, look elsewhere.\n\nSo I thought this game was really fun at first, gave it a good review and was really enjoying the gameplay. As you get further in, however, the game really begins to lose it's fun, and fast.\n\nYou start to see how screwed the ingame economy is. For example, in order to counter enemy tanks, you're going to need the Panzerschreck, which is 35000 silver. That's not bad, if you're a decent teamplayer you get roughly 3000-4000 per match. But when you use it, you're spending thousands to restock it's ammo. Which, if you need to use it a lot in a particular match, often leaves you with a negative balance of silver. In a single match I had to spend over 5000 to replenish it.\n\nSame goes for vehicles, you're going to be spending thousands per match repairing and restocking your vehicles to the point where your meager amounts of silver per match won't cover it, and you'll slowy dwindle your resources until you're forced to use stock gear again. Leaving you ♥♥♥♥ed if the enemy team has a lot of vehicles.\n\nOntop of that, past the beginner weapons you're going to be expected to spend absurd amounts on new weapons (an MP40 costs 127,000) and that's ontop of grinding ribbons for them to be unlocked, and saving up silver without losing it all from repairs and ammo.\n\nTired of recieving negative amounts of credits? Want to unlock new weapons and vehicles? Shekel up goyim, and you can have everything instantly :^) you won't even have to level up, paying does that for you!\n\nedit: looks like even the devs acknowledge this. Check out the ultimate packs and the description for them on Steam.\n"This pack enables you to get the full Heroes & Generals experience, where you can play all roles as Heroes on the battlefields AND command Assault Teams as a General without first having to spend hours, weeks and even months of playtime to progress your characters and unlock weapons, equipment and vehicles."\nThey're TELLING US to forget about playing, just fork out money to get the 'full experience', as if having to play is a chore. Shouldn't the entire game be fun, not just when you fork out $110 or spend months grinding? What ever happened to putting time into a game because it's enjoyable? Not because you 'have to' to have fun...","November 13, 2014","false","9.0"," 245 of 310 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","245","310","0","18"

Those screenshots are graphically enhanced... meaning the graphics in the game looks nothing like them.\n\nI started playing this game a year ago, in April of 2015. I have had 730 hours in the game. I have written 2 previous reviews for this game. The first one was a negative one that I wrote after playing the game for 2 months, and spent 200 hours on it. The second review was a positive one after playing the game for 5 months and having spent 400 on it.\n\nNow this is my third review of this game, and I am sad to have to change my overwhelming positive review to a negative one. This game has been slowly going down hill for the past 6 months/updates (since they have an update every month).\n\nThough most of negative stuff I have to say comes from the update 4 months ago (the Adam's Build).\n\nThe main problem with this game has always been how the developers at Reto decide to "balance" things. The problem is so obvious to everyone on the forums except Reto to the point that we all joke about it. We call it "Reto Logic™".\n\nThe problem with "Reto Logic™" is that they make the most absurd and silly excuses and reasons to do the most crude, unpolished, illogical methods of attempting to balance the game.\n\nFor instance, tank drivers can't initiate a manual reload for their turret mounted coaxial machines guns, or autocannons if you have a Panzer II tank. Reto claims that this is done for game balance... but meanwhile all other vehicles' support machine guns can be reloaded at any given time... Even the support gunner machine gun on a tank can be reloaded... So instead of doing something more logical for the sake of balance like giving the tank driver a slower reload, they just completely disable the ability to reload at all... and the only way for you to reload is by wasting all your ammo in your current clip which not only gives away your position, but wastes extra time.\n\nAnother example is the American M1919 .30 Browning Machine Gun. Most players complain that the rangefinder (iron sight) on the gun is way to optically obstructive for the gun to be used effectively, and ask for it to be flipped down. Reto says no, tells us that the rangefinder blocking most of your screen is there for balance. So instead of balancing the gun statistically, they decide to basically blind the user instead.\n\nAnother example of "Reto Logic™", is instead of simply tweaking stats accordingly they basically decided in the past couple of months just to make every gun unusable. For instance they have been adding muzzle residue clouds to all automatic guns... this wouldn't be a problem at all if they were simply just small highly transparent aesthetic animations.... but no they are large, densely dark residue clouds that are equivalent to a black powder musket discharges that is enough to blind the user.\n\nNot only did they add that. They added a conefire system. Now you may think that conefire means weapon or bullet spread... but no... it doesn't. Conefire is this stupid massive RNG weapon sway, that makes it look like your character's arm is made out of jello... where your character is constantly just moving his arms around in a large drunk wide random circular motion that prevents you from ever getting an accurate precise shot.\n\nSo this game went from a good skill based FPS game, to a drunk blind pray and spray RNG simulator all in one update.\n\nAnd if that wasn't bad enough... The game has extremely poor lighting and sun glare effect. Not to mention black hole shadows.\n\nWhere the majority of the game's graphics has this dark grey filter over it which Reto said they added because of "Pixel Hunters", where people use to be able to see enemy soldiers so far off to the distance...  like 200 meters away where they appeared to be only a few pixels, and still managed to spot and kill them. So after adding this terrible grey soup filter to the game... most players a lot of times can't even see enemy soldiers at 10 or 20 meters in front of them.\n\nThen add that on with the black hole shadows... where entire bright green, or whitish grey tanks can become almost invisible in plain sight when sitting in the shadows.\n\nThen lets not forget the sun glare... the sun glare is unnaturally bright, and is static. It doesn't dynamically change intensity or shape at different viewing angles. Even when going into a shady spot where the sun isn't shinning on your character, you still get sun glare no matter what. Even if you're in a building with solid walls where the sun doesn't shine. The only time the sun glare goes away is if you have the sun at your back at an  angle of somewhere between 175 to 185 degree .\n\nAlso this game for the past entire year that I have been playing, they still hasn't fixed the firing sound and animation bug. Where most of shots fired by someone else makes no sound at all and has no muzzle flash. This is extremely detrimental bug to have in an FPS game because it is literally the difference between life and death. Where someone can be standing literally 2 meters away from you, trying to shoot you in the back, and you simply won't hear at all. They might shoot 20 rounds at you before you even hear the first shot sound. Or a magically invisible enemy tank sitting in the shadows 10 meters right in front of you can be shooting its cannon, and you will never even know its there.\n\nSo in short why do I not recommend this game? Because the developers at Reto do not have any idea how to balance the game. They use the most bizarre illogical unrefined hack slashed methods to balance the game, by simply removing basic game mechanic functionality, trying to blind players in every way possible, dumbing down the gunplay mechanics to the point where your aiming ability doesn't matter at all since whether you hit or not due to the fact that your soldier holds his gun as if he is drunk and has jello for arms and its pure RNG base.\n\nThis game has a lot more problems than just what I mentioned in this review, but this is the stuff that you will encounter first thing off when you start playing the game as an infantryman.\n\nAlso if you're considering becoming a tanker in this game... just remember, the higher the tier the tank is, the more expensive it is, the more easier it is to be killed, and the more inaccurate it's coaxial machine gun is. Yeah you read that right... the more expensive and better armored a tank is... the more it sucks and easier to be killed in. Because the bigger and more armored your tank is, the slower it moves, which just makes it easier for infantrymen with sticky grenades (hand held anti-tank nukes) to run up to you and instantly vaporize you as if you're sitting in a aluminium foil toy car.","April 18","false","765.6"," 204 of 254 people (80%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","80","204","254","27","17"

Now since a few months ago, you have to buy EVERYTHING.\nThe level of P2W on this game is just absurd. This game have turned into the exact definition of pay2win.\n\nLet me give you an example:\n\nThe battles are extremely unbalanced. You only have a rifle and a simple grenade, but the enemy have tanks. You could just buy a basic AT weapon to protect yourself, right? Wrong!\nYou cant buy any AT weapon, unless you unlock it with advanced explosive skills. Dont have the skill? You can buy it for real money.\n\nYou want to be a tank commander? Fine, but you will have to buy it for real money too, so hand over 10 dollars, pal (you can just advance your level with your normal soldier, but since the enemy will always be overpowered, you cant do ♥♥♥♥ in any battle, and that mean no xp).\n\nYou also have to buy your tank (really?), but it wont stop there. Your first tank dosen't even have a cannon, only a MG (REALLY?), so what is the point on driving a pz1 if the enemy have pershings? Buy more stuff, of course!\nWant to have a better tank? Pay 10 dollars again to unlock a better tank (that was suppose to be only unlockable with xp, but hey? this is a P2W, right?)\n\n\nAt the end, the game forces you to spend real money (unlike many other F2P games, where payed content dosen't affect that much the other players gameplay, like TF2 or War Thunder).\n\nOh, did i mentioned that you will have to buy those stuff twice?\nYes, one for the german faction and other for the american faction, because your progress with each faction are individual\n\n\nIf you enjoy being killed by an overpowered enemy without any means to defend yourself, go ahead.\nNow, if you want a game like this, but dont want to be always spending your hard earned money just to have some fun, i recommend you buy rising storm/red orchestra 2. At least on those games you will only have to pay once and will have all the content available equally for everyone.\n\nEDIT:\nOne year after this review, i decided to try it again. Now the game is even worse. If this was a pay to win before, now its a "pay to keep grinding because if you don't, you will get your ♥♥♥ beaten up to death". Everything now cost about 4x more (both in gold and normal in game money).\n\nYep, this game is the true definition to pay2win. Spend your money with Battlefield 4 or some other game like it, because it's less expensive the gold in this game.","July 11, 2014","false","3.0"," 1,633 of 2,258 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","633","2","0","112"

It might be a long review. And yes there is gonna be a TL;DR.\n\nAND NO, I DID NOT GET PAID TO MAKE THIS REVIEW, THIS IS MY PERSONAL REVIEW.\n\nSo lets start off with the history of the game.\nThe game started out in 2010 as a new WWII FPS combined with a RTS that influences eachother. After long development, in 2011 people started to get access to the game. It was great for its time, big maps and good graphics. In 2012/2013 is reached Beta, the game went public and you didn't need a gamekey to get access to it. New stuff was added in Builds, starting from A/Z with names of Generals, for example the R build was called Rommel. Now the game is again in the C build, but with war heroes. The build the game is now in is Bauer, named after 'Mad' Jack Churchill. In 2014 is was one of the first games to pass through greenlight and at the very top of the steamcharts for Free To Play games.\n\nDev team.\nThe current dev team is a company called Reto-Moto Aps. located in Copenhagen. The company was originally founded by some members of Zyrinx and Lemon in 1997 and created IO Interactive and the Hitman series of video games. In 2008 the company reformed and announced that it will focus on multiplayer based games. The name of the company changed to Reto-Moto.\n\nThe Dev team's appearance in the community.\nThe devs always look on the forums, reddit, twitch etc. They interact with the community, taking suggestions, using usermade ideas for then game. Etc. Etc. They even run a Weekly developer stream where questions can be asked, new things get shown for the next build, statics shown from the game etc. (I will leave links to the community related pages in a spoiler at the end.) And on twitch, if a streamer is big enough, he can recieve vouchers that you can redeem of ingame premium currency, that can be used for anything.\n\nCurrent state of the game.\nNow the graphics have been toned down because of people complaining that their potato PCs couldn't handle the game and its 2km²+ maps. There are 3 factions, the US, Germans and Soviets. They all have their own weapons. There are 30+ vehicles and 40+ Weapons available and all accesable WITHOUT any money, it might be a grind. But it gives you a goal.\n\nThere are 2 versions of the First Person shooter, Staged mode and War mode. The staged mode is where you start off to learn the game, grind for weapons etc. It will prepare you for the War mode.\nThe War mode is the gamemode that gets affected by the Real Time Strategy game, and vice versa. If a battle gets created on the RTS. It starts a FPS game, for example an Assault gamemode gets created. You get 2 teams, the defenders and the attackers, if the attackers capture all the objectives. The town on the RTS gets also captured for the faction that won, if the defenders succesfully defend all objectives. Then the town stays theirs.\n\nThe RTS is made out of a giant map of Europe with A LOT of towns, factories, airfields etc. 3000+ to be 'exact'. An officer or general can controll ATs (Assault Teams). These teams can be used to attack or defend a town, each AT has a set amount of resources, for example a single simple Guard unit has 54 Infantry spawns.\n\nThere are currently (16-2-2016) 9 maps, divided into 3 gamemodes. Encounter, Skirmish and Assault.\nThere are 6 character paths, Infantry, Tank Crewman, Pilot, Paratrooper, Recon and General. All unlock at a higher rank. You start as Infantry, when you rise in rank you can choose an other carreer path if you want. You can buy more soldiers that can have different carreer paths.\n\nAnd EVERYTHING is obtainable without spending a single dime.\n\nMy opinion.\nYes, it can be a grindy game, yes you can say there is bullsh*t, but I like the game anyway. I am my self a known person in the community, I help the devs on finding bugs and reporting bugs. I am moderator for a lot of big H&G streamers on Twitch, I used to run a Screenshot contest with reward Premium currency. I like the game, and you might also like it if you spend time in it.\n\nTL;DR\nMight have a bad status on steam, but if you enjoy WWII games, FPS games or RTS. I would recommend you to Atleast try the game out, see it for your self. Don't listen to the bad reviews. Go and research stuff about the game your self.\n\nLinks to community pages and more shenanigans. The official game website. [www.heroesandgenerals.com]\nOfficial game forums.

The weapons feel like they have power behind them, and I have no problems with the sound.The grind, while... 'modest' is tolerable, as long as you play this game for fun and not just to get the next unlock.\n\nAs an example, within 27 hours I have eached rank 5 on one of my soldiers, and am close to reaching rank 5 on another. Rank 5 is important because once you reach it, all of your characters from that point on will enter tier 2 battles. At tier 2 you play against better players and are able to enter the war, where you earn extra experience and credits compared to staged battles.\n\nIn these 27 hours I have also gotten close to a MP40 and Thompson - Which are some of the best SMGs in the game, so don't worry about the grind too much, ok? Just make sure to hold off on weapon modifications and grenade spamming until your a higher rank, those things cost a lot of credits to maintain.\n\nNow that I've talked about that, I have to move onto a major... 'problem' I have with this game - The community.\n\nThe community is extremely toxic. If you don't have at least 200 hours in this game, anything you say will be ignored. Try to add something to a discussion and you will be spat upon and called a 'Noob' (Or things I can't mention here) by 'Superior' players.\n\nI`ll say this - Just because one has 200 hours in a game, doesn't mean they are any good at, nor does that mean they are knowledgable about the game. Anyway, I digress - I`ll say this for any of you thinking to try this game, NEVER in my entire online career have I EVER wanted to quit a game because of the community. Not even League of Legends was so bad.\n\nThat's all I have to say about that - For those of you who didn't read it, here you go.\n\nTLDR:\n\nPros:\n-Graphics aren't great, but they are good.\n-Weapons feel good, they feel like they have power behind them.\n-The sounds are good\n-The game has a somewhat large playerbase, so you`ll get into games quickly\n\nCons:\n-The community\n\nNeutral:\n-The grind may not be tolerable for some.","March 27","false","36.4"," 283 of 372 people (76%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","76","283","372","22","45"

Progress has definitely been slow, however, somewhat constant with some content making its way every now and then. Watching some of the dev streams I simply find it hard to take the developers seriously or professionally when they don’t seem committed or at times seem confused about the information that they are putting out. Sometimes they give off a carelessness attitude. When gamers ask about new maps or content the typical response is “it’s too hard.” Heck sometimes they are actually getting drunk while streaming!! I’m sorry but that may seem cool once or twice but I find it a bit unprofessional after the second time.  They just don’t seem fully committed or professional enough to me to continue to invest in this game.\n\nCustomer/Tech support:\n\nPutting in for a ticket is easy getting a response in a timely manner is not. On a recent ticket I submitted (before I wrote this review) I did not receive a response until two months after the fact. That is all I will say about that.\n\nThe game:\n\n1.  Layout and interface of the game can be awkward to some "North Americans" (game was developed by Europeans) but nonetheless the actual shooting game can be fun. More so if you are willing to pay of course since IT IS a “Pay to Win” model regardless of what many may say. Unlike other pay to win titles this one can moderately affect your performance if you do not pay for premium account. Unlike other similar games in which only your credit/xp earning abilities are affected and not your actual performance. It is still posible to have fun and enjoy the game (somewhat) even if you do not pay. However, keep in mind you will be working SIGNIFICANTLY harder at it than someone with similar skill who is paying.\n\n2. Get ready to pay for everything use!\nThat’s right, you pay for every bullet you fire, every grenade you throw and weapon/vehicle repairs etc. Paying with regular credits is possible but obviulsly ridiculously expensive. Or you can pay with real money of course... Earning credits is awkward and mostly depends on the amount of time you spend in the battle and not the ammount of kills you get or battle performace.\n\n3. Matchmaking, wait times and servers! ( aka queque times) The rather inexplicable phenomena of queue in HnG condemns you to wait for several minutes before and during the battle. Oh yeah and also when you want to play the RTS portion of the game and deploy troops (which can take several days). 1-2 min for a standard battle on average and hard core or “war” battles (the ones that directly affect the RTS map)  can go at LEAST 5-10 min… at the very LEAST. Servers go down or crashes several times a month for inexplicable reasons which continue to persist to this day. Hence they are down all the time for maintenace as well. When the servers go down they always give 1h est up time which almost always turns to a 4-6 hr downtime. Don’t believe me? click here and look at their twitter feed for the last couple of weeks. (https://twitter.com/hgserverstatus). Luckily you at least get reimbursed for that if you paid for premium time... yaaayyyy reto!\n\n4. Gameplay.\nGame play can be fun and intense from time to time with 18 v 18 battles involving infantry, armored personnel carriers, tanks, planes and others. However, keep in mind this game is no Red Orchestra or anything like other hardcore realistic WW2 titles. It’s more of a battlefield 1942 with somewhat better graphics. So do not come here crying for realism… (spoiler alert) there is none. Character movement is clunky and awkward. Vehicle movement/physics also clunky and awkward. For example, a Tiger 2 tank will come to a dead halt due to crashing with a wooden fence even though the fence is destroyable... yeah... Weapon sounds are weird and completely take away from the battlefield immersion. I could swear some of the weapons sounds were taken straight from the sound of power tools coming from the Pep Boys you get your oil change at. Hell my childhood pellet gun sounds more like a real gun compared to the in game weapon sounds! Uniforms and cammo patterns are DEFINITELY awkward and hideous for the most part! Bearing almost no historical resemblance whatsoever (aside from 1 or 2 new ones introduced with the xylander update) and removing any concept of common sense when snipers are wearing brightly colored uniforms and WW2 era uniforms with seemingly modern day cammo patterns LMAO! gtf out of here…\n\n5. RTS MAP! Yeah become a GENERAL!! YEAH Lead your troops! YEAH bait and switch so... Wait what? Yep I hate to sound like the rest but… again… great concept… failed execution. The RTS MAP is simply a terrible joke and unplayable in its current state. If you do manage to get a unit out after waiting for several days in queque (yes I meant actual 24hr days) you will quickly come to realize that this part of the game is completely dominated by fan boys and those who have forwarded their bank accounts to Reto. They have tried to balance this before but have only made it worse to the point which makes it unplayable by most aside from the fan boy community.\n\nVerdict\n\nPersonally, I do not see this title going anywhere other than right down the septic tank, therefore, I cannot recommend this game to anyone. I see this game continuing down the same path as other early releases... The typical 5-7 year long Beta with no end in sight while still gladly hoarding all of your money without making any significant progress. If you are new, get out while you can and don’t even bother. There are other similar titles that are way better and cheaper in price compared to what you would spend here in the long run. If you are an old timer like myself get out too! Or play for free like I do when I’m bored. Also, stop forwarding your paycheck to this company until they start showing some real motivation, dedication and professionalism. I may update if and when significant changes are implemented. For now, im am done with this game.\n\n5.5 out of 10","September 10, 2015","false","954.7"," 247 of 322 people (77%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","77","247","322","17","37"

The pricing of in game items is extremely unbalanced in terms of the amount of time people have to play in order to grab something as simple as a new set of grenades. Even maintaining a weapon and keeping stocked with custom amunition is too expensive. The credits (In game currency) gained per match is also problematic concerning the prices of in game items. Players, with fully modded weapons and excelent characters, need to do extremely well and win in order to not loose credits. Basically, this game requires large sums of time to grind out credits needed to buy some overpriced set of grenades, and to even maintain weapons. That, or  the easy way; pour real world money into the game in order to get everything.

Too bad, now you grind the same stuff again for your second soldier, just so you can play something else than tanker too. Oh you wan't to change weapons during match? Better make 3rd soldier, since it's good to have 1 Anti-tank soldier and 1 Anti-infantry soldier. Oh you have to grind all the ribbons and weapons for the 3rd soldier too.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyravega/recommended/227940/","lyravega","lyravega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lyravega/","474 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGrabbed the game recently. As a player who has spent maybe thousands of hours in DoD, DoD:Source, and many other WWII themed games, this one feels great. Characters have a weight to them, and it is slow paced to most of the games that you see nowadays. Animations are smooth, and the game is trying to be authentic; what I mean by that is, you can see your legs and feet for example, when you take cover your character holds the weapon differently, etc... I mean those stuff which you don't see much nowadays.\n\nGraphics are fine. Sounds can use a lot of work though. WWII themed games, I care about sounds by a great deal. UI can also use some work too, especially the "launcher"; it is sometimes unresponsive, and the weapon upgrade screen can sometimes lead you to wrong directions.\n\nNow, maybe the one thing most of you are wondering. Is the game P2W? I haven't invested much time, but so far apart from one thing, I don't think so. The thing that bothers me is, 2nd Badge being available if you are a VIP member. A badge is basically sort of an achievement, and each badge grants you a different kind of bonus. A VIP member will have a badge advantage, and of course, time advantage.\n\nI said time advantage, let me elaborate on that a little bit. Currently, I get around 3-4k points from a match. I recently unlocked a new weapon (unlocking doesn't mean you can use it instantly; it just means you can purchase it now). It requires 120k+ points. That is around 20-30 matches for a weapon that I cannot test, and it is a bit too much. I hope they add a trial system, giving you access to a weapon for 2-3 matches, to get a feel for that weapon.\n\nThere aren't many weapons in the game yet, and buying a weapon by the hard-earned points you acquire is a big investment. You can also tweak your weapons, but they have not much of a visual/aural effect as far as I can tell. I hope they'll add more weapons soon, I'd like to see British weapons for example.\n\nThe vehicle aspect of the game is definitely interesting. As you progress, you have a choice to become a tanker or a pilot for example. And these two roles may have a dramatic impact on the battles; infantry is always the key, but infantry without support is often bound to fail in their duties.\n\nI have a problem with long battles though, you aren't properly rewarded for your commitment in my opinion. And some battles may drag on for very long. And if you are using a modded weapon, the longer the battle is, the higher your repair cost probably would be. I hope they'll take a look at the repair costs, and maybe fix it to a percentage of gains so that it will be balanced for long battles.\n\nSpeaking of battles, they are actually somewhat different from other games, and it is very interesting. The battles themselves may not be balanced, but the overall war (generally) is. High ranking players commit units to battles, and battles dynamically change as you are playing it; new fronts can open up, and existing ones can collapse for example. Reinforcements can turn the tide of the battle, and lead up to epic experiences. The same dynamic battle system can also lead to battles where your enemy or you has overwhelming forces, which can also end up in heroic fights for the overwhelmed side.\n\nNow, before a conclusion, here is a dynamic battle example. Our side just had a small guard unit (only 3 infantry players), while the enemy had a motorized infantry unit (5 infantry players, with armored transport). Against the odds, we successfully held the enemy for a long while, and our Generals send us reinforcements. As we were about to crush the enemy, their generals send them reinforcements too, as well as opening up new fronts, dragging the battle even further. In the end, we were victorious, and I felt great about that, as I was one of three infantry that held the line for a long time.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone who are interested in the FPS genre in general. If you like WWII theme, definitely give it a try. From F2P aspect, weapon costs could get a tweak, and 2nd badge could be made available to everyone at a certain rank, but nothing major aside from that.","October 15, 2014","true","26.9"," 224 of 297 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","224","297","0","2"

The biggest problem with this game is the Dev team. They just don't understand what they want this game to be, or the basics of how to make a good game period. Even though I usually get paid to consult I will give this Dev team a free hint. GAME FLOW!!\nI love WWII FPS games and the potential here is huge. The artwork is so so but passable. The map creation is lacking. The lighting is horrible. The devs need to remember that a person may play for hours so quit trying to ruin their eye sight with horrible lighting and intense fog. It's not cool looking, it's head ache material and a trip to the eye doctor.\nThe UI is terrible with all kinds of images getting in the way of seeing what you are trying to do which is playing the game. Huge cap point icons in the way of seeing another player. There is a map yanno?\nNotice banners pop up in the middle of the screen blocking what you are currently engaged in. To say that's annoying is being polite. And then there is the Deploy Que. Die in the heat of a great battle and then...wait..wait...and wait...in the deploy que. Rule 101 to a good game...NEVER destroy game flow!! There is never a good reason to destroy game flow.\nThe Grind and pricing. Oh my, where to start. Yes, you want to cause folks to earn that new weapon but making that grind turn into a career is just wrong. Pricing a pistol to cost as much as a tank is beyond belief. Charging folks to pay for weapon repair after every match is just.... well, dumb. As for the weapons themselves well that's easy...look up the stats of each weapon and set them accordingly. Somehow that thought is lost with this dev team. Vehicles made from cardboard that were designed for rough terrain but the slightest bunp in the road sends you spinning out of control. The things that make you go Hmmmm.\nThe new trendy excuse.."This game is in BETA" is wearing thin and the gamers need to stop supporting this nonsense. Oh, you want to try our new sandwich? That will be $4.50 and here's your two pieces of bun. The sandwich is still in BETA so maybe next month we'll put a slice of cheese between those pieces of bun and then maybe month after that we'll add some mustard to the...you get the idea. You wouldn't tolerate that for one moment so why are you gamers putting up with it in gameing?\nI only consider reviewing a game after many hours to make sure I have given a fair shake to the devs. Sadly, this game is something that could be very enjoyable if it were handed over to other devs that know how a game is supposed to work. Save your time, even though it's free, and go play something made by folks with some understanding of what gaming is all about.","May 25","false","426.6"," 98 of 116 people (84%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","84","98","116","6","8"

I wish this game wasn't free2play , without the stupid grind. Although it can still sometimes be fun its just not worth the time. In the description Reto forgot to say- expect to be stuck with the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ basic weapons for 50+ hrs of grind. Good luck have fun if you want to try it out:)","November 7, 2015","false","133.9"," 178 of 235 people (76%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","76","178","235","8","8"

Forget progressing in this game. It tricks you into thinking purchasing a lot of low cost perks like mobile gaming. Before you know it, it cost you way more than 60$ and you STILL had to grind. Don't be a slave to terrible CFOs.\n\n\nIt's "yet another one of those" that's still stuck in the early days of F2P cashmongering. We're back in 2010. The word "Free" means the complete opposite. You'll play this game, and only have access to infantry maps for a short while, and it'll be great. They even give you a free boost that makes the progression feel normal. The first gun unlock is pretty early too! Then you fight tanks. Then your boost ends. Then you count how many games you'd need to win to get the next gun minus all the damn ammo and explosives, and the number's in the 3 digits IF NOT 4. That's when you realize you just COMPLETELY wasted a couple hours.\n\n\n"Gaming's not always about the money!" That's true, but you shouldn't give your money to thieves either. Businessmen who have spent money to get an education in the art of playing with their customers' brains. In the end, if you want a normal experience, you'll have to pay a lot more than a normal game. That's why it's free to play. That's why the first days are amazing. That's why the hole is so deep.","January 20","false","5.4"," 164 of 215 people (76%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","76","164","215","12","5"

However they did warned the players to remove the virus in their game files (after a couple of days later when the virus started). I have played this game for around 1,480 hours and have paid about $200 for some tanks and cosmetics (Which I so-so regret). This game may look appealing however theres way to many bugs and causing your PC to experience HIGH RAM/MEMORY issues (Even for my expensive PC). The Reto-Moto developers don't plan on releasing the GAME out of "Beta" which it is indeed has been in development for about 3-4 years Even PLANETSIDE 2 is way more successful than them! (Heroes and Generals was created around** 2012 way before the steam release).\n\nSQUARE ENIX used to funded them until 2013 and then abandoned it due to the fact that one of their bussiness representatives believed it is a failure and won't succeed which they're right for that matter.Obiviously "Heroes and Generals" was extremely graphic fantastic and has great animations but since Square Enix left they took all those hard labour to make the game back to square one. Which now the developers have been trying to update the game little by little, one step at a time unfortunately. After that Reto-Moto then tried to release their game on steam ( July 11th, 2014) hoping to attract some customers/players to money grab them and save their small company because they are bankrupt or in debt.\n\nI understand they have a small development team and but this game has way to many bugs as well as the worst fact is that their game engine is so terrible it's like running on a potato. I'm not sure if they'll delete this review or not but unforunately that's what Reto-Moto has been known for "deleting posts / community posts / their forum website posts" and anything that has negatively impact them. I will update anything that has been missing of what I've reviewed this terrible game, since after all I don't plan to play this game anymore its way too toxic for my tastes  with their "business ideas".\n\n(For example, always updating new weapons,skins, ONLY 1  new maps every year or so...purchasing in-game tokens for highly expensive equipment, always changing the equipment currency which cost higher than before. Having more characters/ name change for them cost more; dear lord the list goes on and on...) I would prefer if they bought brand new servers and update their game engine instead of those options where the players would stick around the game alot longer than before. OH I forgot the grinding is insane especially the rank system where you'll sacrifice 10 hours trying to get at least 100k of credits to buy a weapon (Which is around 150k-250k credits) Good luck pal!\n\nHere's an orgainzed "Not recomended"** or Negative review.\n\n[X] Weapons and Equipment / tanks/ aircrafts always changing (Prices if not ALWAYS increased) without Reto-Moto's explaination as to "why" or talking about it in his Twitch streams...\n\n[X] Having more Characters and even more name changes for them the price WILL increase after the over cap of 15 total characters (Includes all factions).\n\n[X] Leveling up in the rank system not only used to be harder but NOW it's exceptionally a lot harder than before.\n\n[X] Experience gain is worse than before since many releases of updates just like the rank system.\n\n[X] Ribbons gain is worse than before since many releases of updates just like the rank system and the experience gain...***\n\n[X]  You'll sacrifice 10 hours trying gain 100k credits...\n\nIf you plan on playing any online FPS games I suggest playing planetside with 96+vs 96+ players or Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad which has a more realistic game play (A couple of bullets will kill you, so you'll have to be very tactically inclinced, which I deemed fun.)\n\nLike I said I'll update whenever need be.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDITED: January 12th, 2016 11:47 pm - Ah yes like I mention  since this game runs so poorly the servers always, by always I mean every single week it goes down. (This does not include "in-game maintenance" whatsoever.) That is because the server cannot handle a couple of thousand of players or at least a handful in that respect. As for the game engine itself I'm not sure what engine they're running at but it runs like a potato; terrible optimation for players who can't afford a very compatible computer. (I have a  high-mid graphics card by the way). ALSO I'm very aware that this game is still in "Early Access" or in "BETA" however it is their RIGHT move to keep it this way, after all there will be a couple of lawsuits that this game is still "Uncompleted" if it is completed. But I'm fully "AWARE" Reto-Moto says a couple of times in their twitch/youtube videos that Heroes and Generals is "ALMOST" in their BETA PHASE but "What is ***Almost**?" How far or how long it'll take that the game will be finished or when the bugs will be fixed? Or when they'll introduce a new game engine + a server? If you read the one of the "Early Access Game" in Heroes and generals this is what they said. "Quote on Quote"\n\n->  *Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access?*\n(This is in Steam Early Access, in Heroes and Generals store page.)\n\n“We're approaching the end of our Open Beta/Early Access phase, but it's still too soon for us to put a date on when we'll launch.”\n\nI don't know guys this is reminding me of a game called "RUST". I'll update whenever I miss anything.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEDITED: January 8th, 2016 8:50 pm - Thanks to a fellow user I will provide proof of my claims and I thank for their criticism.\nHeroes and generals used to have a virus in their servers that may or may not infected some users.\n-> https://steamcommunity.com/app/227940/discussions/0/483367798501876809/\n\nSquare Enix funded Heroes and Generals.

Although useful for tank / aircraft battles.\n\n✓ Historical accurate? It's possible but I'm not even so sure, so I'll say they're close.***\n\nI'll update anything needed be. ✓\n\nHope you found this review helpful, but again don't invest your time into Heroes and Generals.","January 8","false","479.9"," 530 of 754 people (70%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","70","530","754","104","60"

Despite it somewhat 'ol battlefied 1942 mechanics which imply that you'll need to shoot someone in the chest three times from m1 garand, and just two times from 'ol springfield bolt action (same goes for other nations too) despite the fact they do shoot on the same rounds. So as much the ballistics of the semi-automatic rifle and bolt-action can be different, the hit impact on the enemy should be basically the same. But that's not Red Orchestra, if you play this game you play it exactly because it's a little kind of the old battlefield with some refreshing global map conflict you can participate on with your buddies. The concept is great, the ridiciolous firing mechanics can be overlooked thanks to it. The buggy physics do fit in nicely into the package you did already accept. It's not a Red Orchestra after all...\n\nFor sure the game have this "something" And I did really enjoyed my time with it, at least the part of it.\n\n\nSadly for me it's a love & hate relationship here. There's many things to like. The quite big maps with multiple capture points adding up to the strategy. The huge array of unlockable weapons and options to customize them with different parts and ammo. Varioush achievments that do grant you some useful badges and unlock these weapons and vehicles you might want to use. Camouflages and skins for your uniform and weapons to make you more unique and blend in into the surrounding. The changable weather on maps as well as the time (haven't encountered the nighttime yet so I cannot say am i exactly correct here). Thats to name a few. With correct teams, maybe with your buddies on ts, you might have lots of fun.\n\nSadly, the game is far from being a finished product. And this shows, but if only was that a problem... There are huge matchmaking issues. I strongly believe that while playing staged matches (so disconnected from the H&G's war map) the player should be able to have a balanced gameplay. Sadly, you won't experience that after crossing the 3rd level with any of your soldiers. From now on, despite being the vanilla soldier with basic rifle and smg in hands, you'll be chewed on by tigers, shot down by snipers from gods know where. All you might hope will be to jump into one of those high-rank tanks and hope that you'll have some luck as a hull-gunner. Or go ride and try capping points while getting slaughtered. The machmaking is terrible. But if only that was a problem. The recent update, timoshenko. I read a lot about the game prior to it and there are obviously problems with it. Russians steam roll every match, I lost 90% of those while i played against them as american gi. I was actually happy to have a chance to play against germany because i could hope to have a chance to win then. But there's more... Basically, the basic smgs of the germany and usa are getting slaughtered by the ppd's with 71 round mags and so on. I could list way more of problems but this one i'll use to picture the problem i have in mind. We play a game that's having ol' battlefield mechanics, it's not aiming to be realistic. So the balance should be the main concern of the game developers. It is not, obviously. You're not equal in the engagment. You should expect being in a disadvantage because your weapon is going to be most likely ♥♥♥♥♥♥. And that's how it is in more that half of situations. Furthermore, if that wasn't enough, the matchmaker is screwed. As I was saying, upon reaching the 3rd level, you'll loose all the fun in the game for a good while. Theoreticall you have a chance to choose a soldier you want to use and grind yourself a new loadout in correct MM enviroment but this don't works. As a result, I had to go with the sihtty grease gun against the hordes of mg42's or worse, pepeshas. I had no chance obviously and it wasn't the fun gameplay. But all right, I survived it, I grinded up the smg achievement enough high to unlock the famous thompshon. And here goes the one of the major problems I find in this game. Which is the absurd costs of the guns and vehicles. Or maybe, rather just guns. Sniper rifle costs above 230.000, just nearly as much as the M26 Pershing! Thomsphon I mentioned, costs 125k. While per match, you'll be lucky to get 3k after reducing the earnings by the costs of repairing the stuff you used and replenishing the ammunition. It's absurd. Especially that tanks are gods of the battlefield but the AT weapons are in most cases a high level unlockables and ammunition to bazookas costs a fortune. Thats not how it should be, and the higher level at munitions as sticky grenades, at mines of various kinds and so forth - can stay that way. But the basics like ammunition to bazookas should be cheaper. Since the side that have more tanks is gonna win, even if these are simple tankettes with only mg's on. It's always a steamroll fest for one side. You'll very rarely find youself on a balanced engagment in which you have time to find your niche, that one road by the stream that allows you to do something on the battlefield and have some fun.\n\nThe game is a ♥♥♥♥♥. And even more so, because it whines and begs to you to open your wallet. That's the most disgusting thing about it. Everything drains your silver in order to make you buy premium/gold. There's no other point that explains the absurd costs of ammo and repairs, not to mention the weapons themselves. Everyday you log in, you'll got a huge pop-out calling you to buy the premium too. The game does not offer you a wonderful time like War Thunder can (it's my personal example), in order to make you want to spent the money on it. It does hit you in the jaw, steamroll with unbalanced matches and then throws you in a full infantry squad against full tank squad in the open field without at weapons. The game does all the ♥♥♥♥ to ♥♥♥♥ you off, to make you want to buy premium to ease up the grind, or rather - skip it. To buy that one weapon/vehicle that will give you the edge and make your games fun again. Might it be the sniper rifle so you'll finally be able to chill in the bushes and wreck havoc between the enemies. Or that better tank that will let you kick everyone's ♥♥♥ and start winning. That's right, the game tries to ♥♥♥♥ you off on purpose and it's making the game pretty much pay to win. And that's the disgusting part about it.\n\nSo far I'll keep on playing but I cannot say for how long. It can be fun, it have it's moments too. But it's horrible in terms of balance, matchmaking and everything else. And it kicks you in the nuts to ask for money. It shouldn't be like that. Because of this, though I do like this game, I'm giving it a negative opinion. The game isn't worth a dime simply because it's ordinary in it's way of demanding it from you.","March 7, 2015","false","227.1"," 273 of 379 people (72%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","72","273","379","20","11"

That silver currency can be spent to upgrade weapons, or buy new weapons, vehicles, etc.  Saving up enough currency to buy a "good" weapon requires you to grind at least 300+ hours.  Meanwhile, as you use grenades or anything with ammunition, you have to spend your currency to replenish your grenade supply.  The entire system is designed to make sure a casual player NEVER EVER EVER accomplishes anything in this game.  It's a dirty, money-grubbing scheme to wear casual players down and finally push them to the point at which they reluctantly break out their wallets.  As a non-paying casual player: you will never get a "good" gun.  You will never level up. You will never be anything but fodder waiting to be slaughtered by the pay-to-win players  ...and yes, this game absolutely groups beginners, pay-to-winners, and 500+ hour players into the same exact battles.  Again, it's a scheme designed to frustrate non-paying casual players into taking out their wallets to overcome the disadvantage.\n\nOne gun:  Yeah, this is self explanatory.  Guns have weight, and the game designers intentionally designed the weight of the guns in such a way to prevent you from carrying more than one.  Unless of course you pay to play, in which case you can pay for light-weight guns that enable you to carry two.  This limitation is exacerbated by the fact that each type of gun is strictly limited to valued use in very specific circumstances.  For example, machine guns are great inside of houses, but are completely useless at long range.  The horrible single-gun system also contributes to the ill-effects of the hero swapping feature.\n\nHero swapping:  In mid-battle, players can change their participating "hero." The game is designed in such a way that each "hero" becomes specialized.  There are tank drivers, pilots, paratroopers, snipers, machine gunners, etc.  Each has a specific role.  Some battle maps cater to specific types.  For example, some maps have wide rivers that must be crossed on foot.  Obviously these maps cater to sniper-rifles.  It's important to stress the point that you CAN NOT change weapons once you've joined a game.  As soldiers trudge across the open water, snipers pick them off.  Machine gunners, whom lack range effectiveness are basically worthless on these types of maps, as there is little to no close-quarters combat.  Here's the trick:  the game allows players to switch between heroes. Thus, if you happen to have played 1000+ hours, you will have the ability to swap out your useless machine-gunner for a more useful sniper.  It's very strange.  Rather than simply switching guns - which would make much more sense, you have to actually switch heroes.  Unfortunately, leveling up those heroes takes hundreds of hours each.  Like other strange mechanics in this game, the hero-swap mechanic was clearly implemented to encourage people to pay-to-win.  IE: pay $50 and you can have both a great machine-gunner hero and a great sniper hero without having to invest 1000+ hours like everyone else.  Why not just allow people to carry 2 guns, or even allow them to swap guns during battle?  Because that wouldn't encourage people to pay money!\n\nHit detection:  When I first started playing this game, this was the very first thing I noticed.  I would run up to an enemy with my trusty machine-gun and start blasting.  As I filled the stationary target with lead, my screen displayed spurts of blood - indicating that my shots were definitely hitting the target.  Bullet after bullet slammed into the enemy's body.  Then, slowly, as I continued to blast away, the target would turn towards me.  Then the bullet-riddled enemy would fire one shot, and BOOM.  I died.  Yep, I shot him half-a-dozen times, and he one-shot-killed me and walked away.  This same, frustrating scenario has happened to me literally hundreds of times.  Check out the forums, and you will see that I am certainly not an isolated case.  It happens to everyone.  It's the most frustrating thing I have ever experienced in a multiplayer shooting game.\n\nHacks:  While you may not necessarily consider this the fault of the game developers at first, you have to consider the entire pay-to-win scheme to fully understand the problem.  This game is free to play.  Anyone with a computer and an email address can play.  If a player cheats and gets banned, then that player can simply register a new email address and cheat again.  They don't lose anything, because they didn't pay anything.  If a player had to pay $40 for a new account every time they got banned from cheating, they would quickly change their cheating ways as their bank accounts were drained from buying more and more new copies of the game to cheat with.  However, since this is free-to-play, the cheaters don't care.  They come in and have their fun ruining a game and getting 30-2 on the killboards.  Then they get banned in a week and create a new account.. rinse-and-repeat.  Believe me, the cheating is prevalent.  As you play you will be saying "gee, I just saw a guy outrun a jeep, shoot me through a wall with a magical bullet from 500 meters away, and absorb 20 shots from a machine gun.  this seems strange."\n\nOverall, I am disappointed by the choices developers made with H&G.  It could have been a unique and fun game, but unfortunately the greedy pay-to-win mechanics sabotaged what otherwise would have been a great experience.\n","November 24, 2014","false","88.5"," 156 of 208 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","156","208","0","13"

Rename the game to "Scrubs with snipers"\n\nEvery single game you'll join will have 1 or 2 blatant hackers, and 60% of the players on both teams, will be bunkered down in the forest, a stick so far up their collective ♥♥♥ that they've apparently impaled themselves on the ground and become immobile. There's no squad system, nor any rewards for playing as a team, so no incentive to do so.\n\nThe general idea behind the game is good, but that's not what we're here to talk about. The game performs terribly on many systems and have recieved little to no love with regards to optimization, which is a fatal flaw in any FPS. It is horribly balanced against teamplay, and the general power of the long ranged weaponry and tanks, makes it so that there's very few "if only to avoid saying two" viable ways to play this game. Camping with a sniper rifle - stick up the ♥♥♥, in the forest, or camp with a Submachine/LMG inside of a building - stick, still well up the ♥♥♥, but inside of a building.\nThe issue lies in the reward system, that is skewed towards promoting defensive play styles, and the complete lack of reasons not to do so. The easiest way to rack up points, is simply to stay on your respective points, killing people as they try to grab it, or alternatively, snipe at the enemy as they spawn, as you are comparatively, massively rewarded for landing a hit frem a distance of around 200 meters.\n\nAt it's current build, I see no reason to play this over any other shooter, except for the fact that it is free, and it's somewhat interesting due to the character progression, though even that quickly gets boring when constantly faced off against the native tribe of angry-stick-up-the-♥♥♥-men who roam the forests of Heroes and Generals. And in the end you're faced with the unavoidable choice of being repeatedly shot in the head from a mile away by stick men, or getting your own stick, implating it with surgical precision in your ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and planting your self on the ground, hoping to set down roots, and one day become the king of all stickmen.","November 20, 2014","false","228.4"," 147 of 195 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","147","195","0","9"

Particularly an in dept development and progression system.\nI have nothing but praise for this game yet still in development. It clearly needs some polishing but then for a BETA one cannot complain in the least sense.\n\nHowever, alas I cannot support a p2w game. As membership will grant you the option to take an extra equipment slot and perk into battle. These are not unlocks no you only have that option if you pay the monthly fee. If they were one time (low) payment unlocks (even per soldier you own) I may forgive them for it but this is a very well camoflaged p2w trick.\n\nAlso a graphics option menu would be nice. Because only being able to fiddle with the (very limited) graphics option during battle (while your team mates are fighting with one man less, cause you need adjust stuff again) is just ♥♥♥♥ poor designing.\n\nHowever trying costs nothing so go for it!\n\nEDIT (see comments for more):\n\nI have spend several hours on this game now and actually do enjoy it between the aimbotters and well as I stated the somewhat OP double badges. Concerning the 4th equipment slot it offers little more than some versatillity as you have the same weight constriction with 3 slots.\nI would say this game is like BF1942, but better and with a campaign (strategy) side to it. I see great potential and thus I have actually financially supported it. But aslong as a game supports so much as 1 p2w option I cannot give it a thumbs up.\n\nAs stated the game needs alot of polishing, more maps and refining the ones they have (good layout on most of them!). Features such kicking people out of your vehicle cause they are .... well you know. And for the same reason prevent people from using your assault squads and wasting every last resource you pump into the war. Prevent spawncamping, Improved physix (its not bad but real weird at times). I have seen bodies fly past the moon for one thing on several occassions. Tanks climing up walls, yet skiiing of low slopes etc etc.\nAnd last not but least rebalance the factions. Right now some US items are OP. As a dedicated GM player we tend to suck it up and not whine (like many, not all, US players). But it can get annoying. I understand the US needs some OP items at this stage as they seem have to largest number of noobs in the game and therefor lost nearly the first 100 wars. But lets face it, it does kinda suck....\n\nI also recently discovered that is does not run on a 2 Gig system. So the system requirements tab is out of date.","October 26, 2014","false","378.5"," 263 of 370 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","263","370","0","9"

This game used to be incredible. It had so much potential, and still does. But sadly the developers have decided to RUIN this game. I mean completly WRECK this game.\n\nAll of the badges used to be so balanced in this game (The way you progress, get new weapons, perks, modifications, ect.) but for some reason, the develpoers decided they wern't making enough money and completly unbalanced the game. Unless you want to shell out hundreds and hundreds of dollars on this game to progress at a reasonable pace. If not it can take up to 200 hours plus to complete a badge (12 levels in a single badge).\n\nAs of today's most recent patch, sniper rifels in the game have been drastically changed. Although some may argue that the new patch effecting sniper rifles helps balance them to remain competitive with the other weapons, it has, in fact just made them even more ridiculous. The main benifit to using a bolt action scoped rifle in the game is the ability to outrange your opponents. But as of today's patch, everyone can mount a resanobly powerful scope on their rife (Bolt or Semi). While this seems to be a good thing -and it most ways it is- they developers lowered the base power of the conventional bolt action scope so much that it is more practial to use it without a scope at all!\n\nWell, that's enough about scopes and rifle. Another new feature is the ability to pay your way through badges. Again this seems to be a good idea, but the way the developers have made it, it costs an astronomical price to buy in ingame currency, But costs an astonishingly minute amout in premium funds! To make things worse there was a recent patch decreasing the amount of experience earned so much that it can take HOURS just to get the first level of a badge! (It used to take minutes.) (It also depends on your skill. But for an average player like myself, it takes quite a bit of time.)\n\nI know throughout this review I have been VERY negative towards this game. But the game does have a lot of potential to be good. It was really really good before the developers got greedy -but who knows? They might wise up 'sometime' soon.- So for those of you who are reading this review before installing this game, I would advise againts installing it at this moment. Although the game advertises "Free to Play" it might as well be 200 dollars USD. Because that's how much you would have to spend to have an enjoyable time. Just as a finial parting note, I'd just like to say, there is not need to treat this review as the gospel. Things will change in coming updates that can, and most likely will make this review out of date(At least I HOPE so). Anyway, thank you so much  for reading this review. I'm truely sorry it has been so negative.\nHave a great day!\n\nRegards,\n\n~Banana","July 8, 2015","false","24.6"," 140 of 187 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","140","187","6","13"

So you have stumbled upon Heroes and Generals. And it seems you looked into the reviews.\n\nGood idea, you came to the reviews.\nBad idea, this game isn't worth your time or your money.\n\n\n"But why?"\nAlright, if you insist.\n\nFirst of all, this is a WW2 themed game. It has FPS (called "Heroes") and RTS (called "Generals") sides of the game.\nSounds neat?\nContinue.\n\nBoth sides of the game are heavily dumbed down.\nFirst is RTS. I will say that I love RTS games (AoE 2 anyone?), but here you won't find anything.\nThere is no Real-time startegy in the game. In AoE 2, you have many tactics at your disposal, like drushing, feudal age rushing, booming, springing, and other tactics you might think off with various units. In HnG, all you need is one type of unit (Moto inf) to attack and defend. I keep telling people that there is no value in it, it's just a point and click adventure, but nooo. Hell, they are better of playing some Facebook freemium games because they are the same, except those games have colour and some aesthetics in them (speaking of colour... I'll get back to that later).\n\nSecondly, the dreaded FPS. I played more of it, because in RTS all you need is to click and drop a few times whichc doesn't take a minute (unless you have hundreds of them, it becomes a pain in the ♥♥♥♥, which is another problem in itself).\nSo, anyways, FPS. First person shooter part. Yeah...\n"If RTS is terrible, so maybe FPS has something redeemable?"\n...no. Simply no.\nFirstly, the graphics.\n"Graphics don't mean anything."\nYeah, I know.\n"Well, what's wrong then?"\nWhat's wrong is that Postal 2 looks better than this horsecrap. And Postal 2 is from 2004.\nHnG started development in 2012, or somewhere then. If you looked at their alpha footages, then you would realize it went to the worse.\nYes, the looks, the feel, the sounds, the EVERYTHING looks terrible compared ot their early footage.\n"Everything? You sure?"\nhttp://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=64276\nDo I need to say more?\n"Okay, and the gameplay?"\nIt's dumbed down, like everything else. All you need to is rush, rush, rush. The cap point is the size of a bathroom, where the only good capping weapon is a SMG and gunplay is spray and pray. Absolutely no tactics needed, just rush.\nDon't tell me I'm wrong, I'm the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that does this. Works every single time.\n\nI'm not even going to talk about other roles, like tanks and planes. Tanks are basically death boxes that are pointless to use, planes just rack up KD but don't really help in anything else besides being annoying, Recons are weaker infantry and Paratroopers are basically infantry that can spawn anywhere. That's all.\n\nOther issues:\nI mentioned colours earlier. Basically, 50 shades of grey, which is actually brown and only with the most boring parts.\nThe devs resist any suggestions from players, or it takes them more time than needed.\nThe devs also make the weirdest decisions. Like for instance, the M1919 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1919_Browning_machine_gun ). In game, it has an annoying ladder sight that blocks a lot of the screen. People asked for that thing flipped down, because it can be done so in real life and you see miles better. Their response? It would make the gun OP. Yes, a sight, a simple sight, it's removal would make a gun OP, which wouldn't affect the gun's performance in any way. Meanwhile, MG42 performs just as much or even better and doesn't have a giant door frame on it.\nSelective realism, in a bad way. Tanks suffer the most, because some tanks overperform while others underperform when IRL it never was like that.\nGrind. I played Runescape, so I shouldn't be complaining about this, but at least it felt like I was progressing there, especially thanks to many ways to grind.\nPremium has two badges. Like, yeah, I know you can buy it for free currency, but that requires you to play a lot, and seeing how crappy the gameplay is...\nNew: I forgot to mention that there is false advertisement going.\nIf you looked at the steam store screenshots, they are all but fake. Of course, many games do that, but these pics are way away from the reality.\nOther than those pics, the devs have tags with "Influence the game's development!" all over their website, when in fact they already have everything settled. Not to mention that threads with lots of constructive posts are usually ignored or outright deleted.\nNew: I also forgot that teamwork is barely rewarded. There is xp rewards if you let others to use your boxes or let them spawn on your vehicle, or fixing the vehicle. But compared to rushing caps where you can even solo it, you get way more xp.\nMight sound ok, but you realize why even squad up? You will still get the same amount of rewards if you went alone than in a squad.\nBesides, the xp award that you get which I mentioned before, are only somewhat recent addition.\n(If this, or any of the points. were mentioned before, correct me and I'll make corrections)\nMy input:\nDon't get me wrong, I like this game. If I didn't I wouldn't be reviewing it.\nBut this game just has too many issues for me not to spread the word. The devs make it seem like they don't play their game, or are too ashamed to say that the game is crappy.\nThey deny/ignore any critizism that is given, and continue doing their own. Then they wonder why people write negative reviews, like this one. And they still continue to think that it's not their own faut.\nIt simply feels like that.\n\nAnyways, that's all I wanted to write about.\n\n\nAny definetly stupid comments will be ignored, like trying to invalidate my review because of my playtime.\nTake it to the forums, I usually be at HnG forums.\n\nSmall FAQ:\nQ: It's a free to play game, you can't review because of this!\nA: I have full rights to review anything, just like how you have full rights to comment (I'm not going to delete unless it is surely breaking Steam Rules & Guidelines).\nIt's a pretty stupid counter argument nonetheless, because something that is free, or is in BETA in fact, is not excluded from reviews. It just doesn't work like that, how will the game improve without critique? I tried as much as possible to keep critique to their actions, excuse me if you find any that is directed.\n\nUpdate: lately it's getting more absurd. The dev who locked the thread mentioned here before said in another thread that "they are looking for constructive feedback". Link to his post, can find it there: http://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=61080&start=20\nYet he called the thread that he locked as unconstructive, when in fact it was pretty much one of the most constructive threads going around.\nDevs post on that locked thread http://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=64276&p=894655#p894655\nThe thread if you want to read from the start:\nhttp://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=64276\n\nAm I still not clear with this? It's not worth your time, nor your money. Especially your money.\nThe developers just don't listen. If you try to post something constructive, it gets locked, or better, deleted.\nThis just can't be expressed enough - don't play, not worth it.\n\nUpdate #2: Seems like they unlocked the thread and told they think it is because day/night cycle needs fastening up. I doubt it was because of that, but we will see.\n\nUpdate #3: Made a foundation for a FAQ.\nOh and Churchill build... Empty build.\nNew guns aren't amazing, and surely were unneeded.\nAll changes were minor, so this build doesn't change much.\n\nOnto D build I guess.\n\nUpdate #4: Thanks to some comments, I remembered another issue. Not a big one, but still an issue.\n\nI also want to thank people who upvoted this review. I appreciate for making it the top rated review on the store page (I honestly didn't expect it)\n\nStill onto D build.\n\nDamn character limit.","April 1","false","196.3"," 216 of 302 people (72%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","72","216","302","37","43"

I have played many hours of the browser game and 200 hrs. in Steam. Yes, it is Pay not to Grind. Yes the devs have made some dubious decisions as many of the reviews have pointed out. But the problem is that I can not tell wether they are trying to make a serious shooter (arma3) or a casual one (COD). I will not discuss the gross missuse of "gold" and "weapon repairs", pleanty of people have talked about it.\n\nThe game is simply unplayable. Movement is like ice skating the acceleration is everywhere, guns are both HORRIBLY unbalenced ( unlike a casual game should be) and unrealistic (unlike a serious shooter should be). The graphics are lackluster, and by the sound and overall preformance of the weapons, I am confident none of the devs have ever shot a firearm.\n\nTanks are made of Tinfoil, able to be killed by any infantry due to the billion Panzerfausts everywhere, aircraft are invincible to all but the most skilled AA gunners. The difference between weapon accuracy and recoil are clearly not understood; some weapons (mg42 ect) have bullets shoot in a rediculus cone while recoil while standing is lackluster. On the other hand, some of the most hated weapons (full auto carbines) are basicaly full auto sniper rifles.\n\nIn its current state there is no VOIP, only team chat and a hillariouisly useless whistle. Say im sweeping through a building, is my teammate in the room im about to grenade? I would whistle, but the other team will make the same damn noise back! Why not use some of the actual checks used in WWII; either a specifically patterned whistle for each country or a "passphrase" in their language?\n\nNow if you, dear reader/dev, has lived through this so far, there are some amazing aspects of this game too. The tank warfare mechanics are truly great. The idea of weapon modification is instituted well enough, and the maps are large and very well put together.\n\nBut here's the thing. As of now the game has "MIxed Reviews" on Steam. Just start scroling trough the reviews. ALL of them are thumbs down!!! At the rate this is going "Mostly Negitive" is comming fast. For the love of all that is videogaming, you need to change your aproach to this game. Either make it an arcade game and ballence the s.hit out of it, or make it serious with some damn research. We dont need any more god damned skins or camos. We need graphics from this decade, we need direction, we need someone to get off their a.ss and right this sinking ship.\n\nHeres the deal untill this game stops s.hitting around and makes it's self into something, pay the $20 and go buy Red Orchestra 2.

I can't deny that it's a lot of fun, but the grind is so ridiculous that I can't recommend it right now.

The game length was 32:06.\nI received 695 XP and 4241 credits.\nTo unlock early-game weapons such as the G43 (German semi-automatic rifle) that costs 21300 credits you'd have to play a little over 5 hours (assuming that you got the score that I did this match, very unlikely that you do game after game).\nNow you want to unlock the K98k bolt-action rifle. Awesome. For that you'll need 74550 credits, once again assuming that you receive 695 credits every 32 (lets say 30) minutes. That would require you to play for about 53 hours to unlock that one weapon. Now I know I'm tired doing this math, and it looks like a lot, but I don't believe that I did any mistakes here.

The game already had too many core issues with strategy map, severe unbalance especially if playing as Germans and almost game killing bugs. There was no justificaton to release a new faction at this time other than increased revenue streams.\n\nGreat potential but unfortuantely has turned into a huge missed opportunity, each build over past 18 months has moved the game focus to full arcade P2W to take as much real cash as possible from new players while they still can and while completely ignoring almost game breaking issues.\n\nDevelopers charging exhorbitant rates for a game still in Beta, avoid and don't waste your money on this clear P2W title.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nAlmost 6 months later since first review, and game has only gotten even worse each build.

The developers are completely incompetant, they have no clue how to create a user interface, or proper in-game chat, for example. Standard features which have been around since the 90's, like blocking people in chat, are missing; stupid crap like that is all throughout the game. Paratroopers run around the battlefield with their parachutes still attached, ruining camo, and the chute is a hitbox which clips through walls and can get you killed. Combat badges which you earn and equip have such vague descriptions that nobody knows what they actually do, and developer Reto-Moto says it's too difficult to edit the descriptions! Balance? Pft, don't get me started. The grind? It's punishing, you have to grind just to get a pistol for your soldier (unless you wanna drop real cash, of course). Every patch the grind gets worse (ways to get xp removed, ect). Really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I spent money, but hopefully I've learned my lesson.\n\nPlay the game, it has potential, but don't spend money until the Devs get their stuff together.\n\nFor those of you who seem shocked that I've played this game as much as I have but don't recommend it.

It just isnt good, satisfying, or fun. If you play the game and go through weapons you will quickly start to see crazy oddities between them. Some sway or wobble like you might expect and are affected by your movement as well as factors like crouched or standing. While others seem to be drone controllerd laser cannons from the future. Hardly affected by player movement and able to shot with alarming accuracy even if the person is on fire, being beaten by a shovel, doing their taxes and standing in the blast of a tanks cannon.\n\nMy first secondary reason is one no H&H player can argue with. The maps. Many of the maps have flaws but thats not really the problem as the devs are trying to fix that. New maps just cant come fast enough. They are few and very far between. Even when they do come they will suffer the same problem that drives me mad and that leads to the next problem...\n\nSplit battles. The maps are set up that attackers come from two sides against an enemy somewhere in the middle trying to hold a series of points. On paper it seems ok but they have two problems. First the matchmaker is beyond horrible and will start games with three or four players on each side and often times only add a few players in by the time the battle is over. Secondly even when the matchmaker works and each side fills up with players they end up split between fronts. I dont know about you but I like intense battles. If I wanted small squad battles there are lots of good games I can go to for that. They really need to reduce the maps to a single attacking front verses a single defending line to really focus and amp up the intensity of battles. Which can be reduced to camping fests thanks to certain weapons. No I am not just picking on the one shot wonder sniper rifles either. Any veteren of the game will know the weapons I'm talking about.\n\nThen there are the hill climbing forest sneaking tanks but.. no.. no I wanted to keep this short and its already not.\n\nI will probably still jump into the game now and then but wont really delve back into it until 2016 and see if its any better. If things have changed I will dump this review or update it.\n\nHappy hunting.","October 21, 2015","false","577.5"," 182 of 257 people (71%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","71","182","257","42","1"

What does that mean? It means that the grind just got easier. Sure, if you are new to the game, you still might have a rought time at the start trying to figure out a playing style, and getting a hang of the game mechanics, but you won't be having to grind for hourse on end just to buy a pistol. With the current system, you are paid by the minute, so the longer you play, the more money you make. I see this as espacially good for newcomers, as with the old system, many nubs to the game were discurraged by the horrible credit grind. With the last update (the Xylander Build) I feel as though the grind has been more or less improved, and that the game is now a lot friendlier to new players that it was before.\n\nI highly recommend you try the game out, or if you quite before, try it again. I'm sure you'll find that the grind isn't as hard as it was before :D\n\n\nEDIT: I would personally recommend that you don't acknowledge anyone's review if they have less than like, 35 hours on record. Most of the reviews I've read these people are usually spreading false information about the mechanics of the game. Not, that you should not consider their reviews, I'm just sayin' sometimes people who cannot insta-win a game in less than 10 hours usually go off and write buthurt review like that :P\n\nIt should be noted that the game still has a steep learning curve - it still takes a while to fully, or even partially grasp the mechanics of the game, and how it is supposed to be played. Do not fret though!! If you have a little patience, and stop paying attention to those silly kill/death ratios, you'll be good to go! :D\n\n*It is also worth noting, as someone on the comments for my review....kindly...pointed out, that this is not a full review, but just an announcment about and issue being fixed (which was long overdue).","September 2, 2015","true","775.4"," 218 of 313 people (70%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","70","218","313","11","36"

Every update.\n\nAlso, problems bugs are not corrected from update to update.

But playing usa now feels like cheating...  Playing soviet feels like a buffer faction with nothing really good (yes they got the AT rifle, but THATS IT)  And playing germany will only break your heart as everything you used to like about them gets nerfed and rendered useless after a while.\n\nI'm really sad about it, but because of the huge imbalances and recurring bugs, I cannot rec that game anymore.\n\nDoesnt mean I would not recommand it again if the problems above are fixed, though.  Yes, the game as it is is pretty much flawed, but there IS frequent updates.

People say it's not pay to win and they are right, it's pay to win or lose. You're paying for cosmetics because if you get stingy and purchase a Tiger tank or Pershing, everytime you battle you are now put into the heavy tank battles meaning get ready for a fire-fight. I have seen Tiger tanks alone in battles but that is an extreme rarety. This game should allow all divisions in a single battle not tier systems like MOH, that game had tier systems because it was based on special operations not a full blown WW2 skirmish FPS game. The game should allow all units, heavy tanks included to participate in battles do not narrow them down to Heavy Tanks vs Heavy Tanks, if someone wanted that they would just play  World of Tanks.\n\nThis is great in theory but what was even the point in purchasing a tank with real cash if I'm just put into a seperate tier to get my tail handed to me? You're being lured to purchase nearly every item in the game and unlike Call of Duty: World at War which does allow tanks in some of their MP Maps, you have to purchase these weapons you can't just unlock them with rank. The game doesn't do itself any credit by making nearly every item in the game cost money, everything from guns, tanks, planes, even ammo & personal gun upgrades/new bullets cost credits.\n\nI made myself a veteran for 30 days but honestly I'm not seeing much of a difference, you hammer in this game to earn promotions but what does that even give you? Nothing. You earn promotions but have to buy all the weapons with the cash you earn.. Instead of doing what most COD/MOH games would do and allow you new weapons when you rank up, you are forced to spend the credits you have earned on weapons that may even be useless in some situations.\n\nThe MP40 Sub-Machine gun costs around 75,000 credits, however in long distance fights it's useless, a Tiger tank costs 290,000 credits which would take months to earn. Ammo is around $500 coins when it runs out, tank repairs = 18,000 credits.. This game literally has a bait of rare items on a fishing pole and the gamers are the fish it's trying to nab. The company is the fisherman and we are the stupid trout who fall right into their hands.\n\nThe game does itself credit by making the game fun and interactive but there is no real point in playing, you may earn a special rank such as pilot but you'll be thrown into a dogfight with other pilots who may or may not have better experience.\n\nI would much rather pay $30 for a real game then be forced to stare at in app purchases on every single item. True you don't have to spend any real money but again, what's the point? The game doesn't have trading cards and there are no achievements so really, what is the point?\n\n\nI wanted to vote yes but this game is just to glitchy and un-rewarding to truly say yes. Maybe if they changed their way of rewarding the player by offering free versions of the weapon as you get promoted in each nation that would be more interesting, but being forced to basically repair, re-ammo, restock, rebuy, re-upgrade and re-annoy me with micro-transactions everywhere is just uncanny.\n\nThere are times when you are hopelessly being attacked by hackers and the team has tried to manage this but I believe they need to have a system that checks all outside programs asides steam and this game.\n\n\n\nThe developers made a great game but the glory was ruined by the greed.. Again I'd much rather pay $30 to have a system like COD/MOH where you can unlock all guns as you rank up then one forcing me to cough up my hard earned coins. I would like to use the coins to buy skins for my gun or maybe my character, and maybe a few other things cosmetic but asides that I can't support a company that does this.\n\nI'm sorry to anyone who disagrees with my review but this is just my personal viewing of the game itself.","September 15, 2015","false","184.3"," 143 of 198 people (72%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","72","143","198","7","17"

Reto just keeps doing it over and over again.\n\nDon't even bother installing unless you're looking for a WWII game you can use to kill 1-3 hours. It was hard enough to grind before, even more so after the recent ribbon XP nerf. Weapons are "balanced" through maintenance costs. You can barely even make enough credits in a game to cover repair costs. An antipersonnel mine starts with 24 uses and ends with a 28k credit refill (1000 credits a use). You can earn roughly 1000-5000 credits per match depending on your performance. Bullets, weapon mods, vehicles, chastity belt - anything that you use needs to be repaired every game and it will constantly screw you over. The dev team is also incompentent and has cornered the playerbase with huge grindwalls. The gameplay itself is fun at first, but only until you get tired of getting ♥♥♥♥ on by 10 German tankers and 1 shotting scoped BA rifles. Gameplay is the only thing it has going for it, and that goes stale after rank 3, where you're anally ravaged by end-game enemy tankers and recon. Oh, and you get like 10 weapons (probably less, I haven't counted) to choose from per faction. Most of which you can't even unlock because you need to grind a ribbon for quite literally hundreds of hours.\n\nIt's P2W garbage; Reto has been running it into the ground and it's not going to get better.

Developer refuses to fix underlying bugs or maybe they are just incompetent.  I'm leaning towards the latter.  Full of bugs.  Poor hit detection, poor game performance.  Developers state that most players never get into the RTS side or play "war" battles.  When matches are limited to 18v18 and there are maybe 5-6 matches with your ping, what the hell do they expect.  There's no room in the battles.\n\nIn summary; RETO is a third rate developer that had a good idea but don't have the resources nor the skill to implement.  Avoid.\n\nUpdate 2016-03-16:\n\nGame is complete garbage now.  Do not play.  Graphics are terrible and washed out.  The dope developers try to say it's because they want a cinematic look like "band of brother" etc.  This is the exact opposite of what you want in a twitch shooter.  Don't let anyone fool you as that is what this is.  There are no tactics.  There is no strategy.  I honestly don't know why I play it.  Beta for years.  Each update adds more crap that no one wants.  Game still runs through flash and these reto schmucks have no plan to update.  Waste of disc space.\n\nTo all other developers;  Please put out a WWII shooter and you will destroy this game and these scrub devs.\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nThis developer continues to demonstrate significant disdain for the opinon of it's playing community.  The change aspects of the game that they don't tell the players about.  The have no understanding on how to create a decent user experience.   I would not give these guys a dime as they don't give a damn about you.\n\nThe game is an interesting concept, combining FPS with a real time strategy, but they've broken the RTS side of the game so badly.  Every change makes the experience worse.\n\nSome examples:\nLoud blaring music when a point is captured (not that you need to hear in a FPS game)\nSignificant weapon sway unless prone for scoped rifles (but you can't prone in most places and if you can, you can't aim down the weapon with out some sort of spasm)\nInsane grind unless you pay money (new change this week)\nThis game is not pay to win, but pay to avoid spending 200 hrs to unlock a rifle.  If you haven't been playing it for a while, don't start as you are screwed.\n\nAvoid at all costs unless something significant changes.","June 3, 2015","false","831.6"," 88 of 115 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","88","115","0","7"

Frequent server downtime,a broken and unrewarding currency system, and the ever shifting lack of balance all indicate the developer's clear lack of understanding of FPS dynamics, and simply, good business. The only sense of purpose or accomplishment that comes from this game is playing in a clan-setting. To top it all off: with glitches & bugs galore in a game that should be far better developed at this stage in its product life, you will find yourself fighting the game mechanics more often than you will fight the players.

The lack of development progress reeks of lack of leadership or a non-existent game design doc, with no clear path on where to go.\n\nCommunication with the game community from the developers has gone from poor to abyssmal, with continued promises to work on improving it. The player community has grown increasingly toxic as many of the older "vets" have left the game and those left fanatically defend the dev team and the game, while being blind to the serious problems that have persisted for years now.\n\nThe persistent problems include a terrible matchmaking system, that makes squad play a struggle at best and a nightmare at times, especially if attempting to squad play in "war" battles. Other long term problems include the strategy part of the game, with the deployment queues for Assault Teams (units) often lasting longer than the wars themselves, resulting in player never getting to take part in each war before it is over.\n\nGraphics in the game have actually worsened in the last year, as the devs have "balanced" giving every infantryman access to "scopes" by adding extra fog and extreme shadows, making it impossible to see things at range or often up close.\n\nSound effects in game are said to "being worked on", but positional audio has been broken for a long time, making it impossible at times to distinguish if a person next to you shooting is right or left, front or behind. Other sounds never actually work, so that tank drivers do not hear incoming attacks and/or damage, until they explode, infantry don't hear gunshots that end up killing them, etc.\n\nThe biggest downwards movement in the game has been the upping of the "Grind". Making progress leveling up, earning credits is now glacially slow, to the point you have to be a masochist to endure it. A year or two ago the devs encouraged players to have numerous characters, envisioned them like a "deck of Pokeman cards" (quote from Red B.) that the players could switch between as needed. Now, with the immense grind, leveling multiple characters is a nightmarish chore.\n\nThe focus of the game now seems on harpooning "whales", who are willing to spend hundreds of dollars to speed their progress in the game, while "casual" players are left to run into the grind wall and bounce off, to land in other games. If you look at the Steam statistics, the playerbase is dwindling, which is quite evident in game with the difficulty finding battles during many parts of the day outside of European prime time.\n\nThere is always a chance things could turn around, but outside of a serious change in development team, it's unlikely.","May 6","false","959.6"," 82 of 107 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","82","107","2","1"

Some guns are just way to overpowered. For example, the BAR and M1/M2 Carbines for the USA. With all the extra attachments which makes them just insane to fight against.\n\nAlso, let's not forget the complete exploiting spam of sniper rifles in this game. The majority of the people with rifles, have a scope on them. There is just no limitation, this simply changes battles in sniper fights, where the unfortunate players who can't afford them yet are to be used as cap/practice targets.\n\nThis all makes grinding simply impossible as you easily decide to stop playing after one game because you just can't be arsed to go through that sh*t again.\n\nI seriously hope that at some points the developers start using their brains and exploit the great possibilities this game has.

I usually launch non-Steam version excepting payment.\n\n日本語と英語の二ヶ国語でのレビューに挑戦してみたいと思います。\nThis Review is written in Japanese and English. Sorry about my poor English.\n\nまず何より先に言っておきたいのですが、このゲームはアメリカ軍がドイツ軍より有利な条件になっています。ですが最終的にはドイツ軍側の武器も充実してきます。ドイツ側プレイヤーに求められるのは忍耐です。たとえ経験豊富なFPSプレイヤーであっても、兵士が育ちきるまでは、ドイツ側はアメリカ兵に倒されまくる事を覚悟しましょう。\n\nAll what I'd like to say is " US weapons of fresh soldiers are stronger than German ones in this game". Of course, German weapon can be strong in the end. GERMAN PLAYERS MUST BE PATIENT. Until your trooper trained enough, you will be killed so many times even if you are experienced in First-person shooter. Don't worry about the "Kill-Death Ratio". In this game, tankers usually make 30kill-0death score or more. Anyway, if you want to play on Axis side, please remember these disadvantages as follows.\n\n第一に、歩兵装備の優位性です。ドイツ軍のG43ライフルは威力や反動の面でアメリカ軍のM1ガーランドに劣っています。また、ドイツ兵が最初に購入できるようになるMP34サブマシンガンは装弾数が20発しかないため、アメリカ兵のM3グリースガンやM1トンプソンと撃ち合う際に苦しい思いをすること請け合いです。サブマシンガンで戦果を挙げてリボンをLv UPさせればMP40を購入できるようになりますが、かなり高価(MG34や38t戦車よりも値段が高い)ですし、M1トンプソンの火力や連射性能にはどうしても負けてしまいます。\n\nFirst, US infantry equipments are superior than German's ones. The damage and recoil of G43 rifle(German beginning rifle) are inferior than M1 Garand(American). If you want to keep using this rifle for long time, you should improve these status by installing weapon mods. After that, this rifle will be able to defeat Uncle Sam with only twice body-hits in close to middle range. MP34 Submachine gun has only 20 rounds while M3 Greese gun has 30 rounds. This gap suffer German players. Of course, you can purchase MP40 Submachine gun when you earn enough EXPs of SMG ribbon.However, its Fire Power and Rate of Fire is still worse than M1 Thompson. In addition, the biggest problem is ...... MP40 is so expensive. Its price is higher than MG34 and even light tanks !!\n\n第二に、戦車の性能の差です。「ドイツ戦車といえばWW2最強だろ！」と考える人は少なくないと思われますが、少なくともこのゲームではドイツ戦車乗りは茨の道を歩かされることは間違いないと言えるでしょう。というのもこのゲーム、ドイツ戦車兵はまず1号戦車からスタートするのですが、敵として遭遇(マッチング)する相手は、皆この戦車よりも強力です。M24チャーフィどころか、M5スチュアート相手にも勝機はほぼありません。具体的に言うと、高価なAPCR弾を奴らの背面に打ち込んでも、まったく砲弾が貫通してくれずにノーダメージとなります。M2A2軽戦車が相手ならまだ勝ち目はありますが、向こうは12.7mm機関銃を装備しているのに対し、こちらは7.92mm機関銃しかないので相変わらず苦しいです。歩兵やジープを撃ってはクレジットやリボン経験値を稼ぎ、38t戦車を手に入れるまでは、ひたすら苦労することでしょう。ティーガーやティーガー2は確かに強力なのですが、そもそも投入できる戦場が絶対的に少ないです。なおドイツ重戦車の仮想敵はM26パーシングです。\n\nSecondly, the difference of the quality of Tanks is serious. Excepting Russian, most people may believe "German tanks are best in WW 2 !!". Although it might be true, in this game, German tank soldiers must walk thorny path. Pz.I light tank(German beginning tank) is the worst tank, and it will be just a coffin in Tank battle.This tank bring only a pair of 7.92mm machine gun while American M2A2 LT has 12.7mm machine gun. For example, however when you shoot APCR(better penetration and more expensive ammo) against the back armor of M5 Stuart or M24 chaffee, it can NEVER penetrate(shoot out) their armor, even THEY ARE LIGHT TANKS!! In case, against M4 sherman or M26 persing? Needless to answer...... So, if you want to train German tanker, I recommand you to avoid tank battle with Pz.I. Attack only enemy infantry and non-armored vehicles, and gain EXPs of Light tank ribbon to buy 38t tank. It is the best light tank in German, and it can kill American light tank from its front. German Heavy tanks are actually good, but there are only a few opportunity to cast them in standard battle.\n\nとまあ、こんな感じにドイツ側はかなりマゾい戦いを強いられますが、兵士が育って武器や車両が揃ってくれば、段々と楽しくなってきます。最初のうちは、1ゲームがすぐ終わるSkirmishルールの戦場でクレジットを稼ぐのが良いでしょう。\n\nLike this, german player will fight under disadvantages. But, after getting well-trained soldier and purchase enough weapons, you will feel this game fun. While you are new player, you should join only "Skirmish" battle, and earn EXPs and Credits. Skirmish mode battle takes less time thans "Assault" mode battle.\n\nまた、これは米独両軍の新兵に気をつけて欲しいのですが、雇用したての歩兵は対戦車兵器を全く持っていませんし、買えません。もちろん、初期装備の手榴弾は対人用途にしか使えず、装甲車両には全くダメージが入らないため、先述の1号戦車にさえも遠距離から一方的に虐殺されかねないです。更にこのゲームの対戦車兵器は威力が弱く、紙装甲で有名なM18ヘルキャット相手ですら、パンツァーファウストを3発は直撃させないと撃破できません。対戦車手榴弾もあるのですが、これは戦車破壊リボンのレベルがかなり上がっていないと購入できず、敵戦車に肉薄するリスクを要するにも関わらず、戦車を一撃で撃破できるRed Orchestraシリーズの対戦車手榴弾とは違い、このゲームの対戦車手榴弾は、軽戦車を撃破するのにすら2～3個の使用を必要とされます。やはり敵戦車を撃破するには、こちらも戦車を出して対抗するのが1番安全なように思えます。\n\nFinally, I need to tell an important thing to both US and German new players. The fresh soldier has no Anti-tank weapons, and they cannot buy them yet. Your Anti-human grenades cause quite NO damage against armor targets. It means, you can easily be slaughtered by even Pz.I light tank!! And, compared with "Red Orchestra" series, the damage of Anti-tank weapons is weaker and weaker. For exapmle. you will need 3 direct hit of Panzerfaust to kill M18 hellcat(even this tank-destroyer has only 13~25mm of armor). If you use Anti-tank grenade(this is so risky), it also needs twice or more. Using Panzerschreck or M1A1 Bazooka is more damage than Panzeraust, and much safer than Anti-tank grenade. But their prices are so expensive. After consuming all 50 rounds, you need to supply them at the same prices of buying new ones. As the result, when you get suffered by enemy tanks and you want to eliminate them, you should cast a tank, like enemy does.","January 17, 2015","true","101.9"," 249 of 377 people (66%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","66","249","377","81","17"

Everyone had more or less the same weapons, vehicles were rare, and it felt very rewarding capturing objectives and holding the enemy back. But that's only during levels 1 and 2.\n\nOnce you hit level 3 with any soldier (you can play a soldier from each faction, and they level up according to how much you play them), matchmaking sets you up with the rest of the playerbase in a "balanced" game where just about everyone is 5 or 6 ranks above you and they can all drive tanks. That's basically what this game becomes. Tanks. Go play world of tanks and you pretty much have played this game. I still have my weapons from level 1, with an upgrade thrown in here and there, but it doesn't matter. Nobody plays infantry other than to snipe from 200 meters away, and everybody else is playing a tanker. Here I am, noob weapons, no vehicle to speak of, and I usually end the match at like 1/6 K:D (Before level 3 I would almost always be at the top of the leaderboards with at least a 2.0 KD and a lot of captures). Never mind capturing points, the enemy tanks will just swoop in as soon as they see their objective point being captured. So I guess you should buy an anti tank weapon, but oh wait it costs like 30,000 credits and you only unlock it for one soldier. Each game gives you around 2000 credits, more or less. But anyway, play the soldier with the anti tank weapon so you're not so useless. Try to sneak around the map to come up behind the enemy and shoot a rocket in their ♥♥♥. Oh too bad, you got sniped.\n\n2/10\n\nWill update my recommendation when I play again in a few months and when the developers update the game so that it's "balanced".

I thought the game was gonna be a WW2 Planetside from watching the trailer 2 but its much worse. I have yet to see America ever win a war. To have another class in the game you have to buy another character level him up from level 1. An MP-40 Costs about 130k coins and you get around 4k per win. The other characters you are supposed to buy are like situational classes you can make such as a sniper or a character with an AT weapon. Most of the equipment in the game is overpriced such as the grenades which you have to pay to replenish which cost more to replenish than you get per win. You have to pay coins to choose a new role such as pilot or paratrooper and once you choose that role you cant go back to infantry unless you pay coins or create a new character. I did a little bit of air combat and it was pretty dull and boring. There wasnt even a tutorial on how to use the airplanes. The tutorial basically tells you to shoot weapons and doesnt explain any of the features of the game. All in all the game needs some work and not updates that allow you to purchase "starter sets".\n\n6/10 Would not recommend","October 3, 2014","false","69.0"," 126 of 183 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","126","183","0","13"

The concept of the large scale war type thing is cool. Having a map that can be conquered  is great.\n\nBut the rest of the game. The gunplay  Absolutly horrid. The recoil on weapons especially semi auto rifles is ludicris. The M1 Garand in this game recoils like its a 10guage shotgun. Owning an M1 Garand in real life I can tell you there isnt much recoil since the guns weight soaks up the recoil. The same for the other semi autos. Yes you can buy special things that make the guns more accurate or recoil less but you shouldnt have to. Another thing about the semi autos is they have a set fire rate meaning no matter how fast you are pulling the trigger the gun will only shoot so fast. Thats a terrible design especially for semi autos. Not like this would make any sense sense since the guns recoil is so high.\n\nThe vehicles are deffintily cool and the amount of vehicle is also neat. There is a pretty good amount of vehicles in game. To bad they are locked behind a terrible grind. A grind so bad I actually just bought the Halftrack I wanted only to see I couldnt use it on every map only on some maps depending on what was fighting. Not that it is very usefull any way. From what I say any ground vehicle thats not a tank is useless. Planes seem ok not that I ever flew them. Another problem is spawn camping with vehicles is terrible. You can pin the enamy down at their spawn and there is pretty much nothing they can do unless you happen to have someone who bought a better tank then the enamies has.\n\nControls/ui. One of number of flaws I find with this game is that you cant change the controls from the game menu. You have to be in game in order to change the controls. One other problem is the game doesnt have controller support I think with any game that features vehicle especially aircraft needs some form of controller support.\n\n\nThis game had so much potential I feel but there is so much you either have to do a terrible grind or just pay for. Cool idea terrible execution.\n\nGo buy red Orechestra 2 instead. This game just feels like a worse version of Red Orchestra 2.","November 6, 2015","false","28.4"," 80 of 110 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","80","110","4","0"

Quite enjoyable however is super grindy and is super unbalanced. Germany quite clearly destroys everyone in everything all the time. The Kar98k will one shot you in the torso.  The MG42 outclasses the other faction's LMGs. They're motorcycle can fit 2 people on plus a 3rd firing a MG in a side car and a fully upgraded MP40 will 3 hit, fires its entire load in about 5 seconds, and is perfectly accurate up to 50m while hip firing.\n\nLearning the mechanics of other classes such as Piloting is also extremely difficult as the game has no ingame tutorial or any sort of solo practice mode. The only way to learn is on the fly during a match. Expect to either crash into trees, the ground, other pilots, buildings or into way more experienced pilot's MG fire.\n\nThe worst thing by far has to be the match making (for staged battles) tho. Its quite clear that it just throws you into the most ready game with the 'ideal' ping levels. The amount of times I've been throw into 5 vs 5 player matches where one side is fresh out of level 3 (and tier 1) and the other side is level 10+ with fully upgraded MP40s only is staggering.\n\nWant to just roam around with friends? You'll need at least 3 other people to form a squad, and you'll all have to be the same role. Someone wanna pilot while someone wanna drives a tank? You'll have to find someone else or try joining through the friend's list.\n\nIn my experience, joining through the Friend's list is absolutely terrible. You will wait up to 10 minutes waiting for a spot to join your friend's game which is always almost over by the time you get in. Perhaps it's different if you are like me and your solo stuff gets you put into games with little to no people. However my friend always seemed to join fairly full games. This could be because hes on the East Coast and I am on the West Coast.\n\nGame's cash shop options are fairly balanced tho. And it really is fun when you get into a nicely balanced full game.","May 15, 2015","false","49.6"," 118 of 173 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","118","173","7","6"

Lots of intense and fun moments on the battlefield!\n\nPhysics in this game are awesome and very funny!\n\nI experienced battles of mere minutes where team playing we quickly dominate our opponent and some longer than an hour and a half. Of course these don't amount for the majority of the battles.\n\nI know FPS 1st timers progressing well few hours a day. Actually to quote the words of one "I might have the highest death rate but I have the best time".\n\nNot just your typical first person shooter, a FPS with a real time strategy side to it on the war map plus MMO & RPG traits.\n\nThe 32 players per battle at the moment is ideal both performance wise (for servers & players) and to have various battles ongoing at the same time. Battles which make a difference towards the war continuously played by all 3 factions. Additionally there's real time participation involved on the strategy map from all factions moving assault teams through the map providing resources to every battle. Making every battle count and have a different amount of resources for teams which makes up for some glorious victories through seemingly impossible odds. If you're looking for reality there you have it, in war not all battles are fair. That said who's to say the number of players per battle won't change in future, although the game delivers as it is.\n\nVarious soldier classes to have fun with - infantry, recon, tank crewman, paratrooper, fighter pilot & general. A big variety of weapons, explosives & vehicles. You can actually ride a bicycle, jeep, motorbike, APC, armored recon vehicles, various grades of tanks (light, medium, heavy, destroyers) and planes.\n\nWith exception for general which is the highest rank all classes can pretty much be unlocked with ease depending on how much time you have in your hands.\n\nRecon class takes a bit more to reach, has some expenses to it and with mods can 1 hit kill. Probably a good thing otherwise everyone would be up in the hills fairy hunting and tree hugging rather than helping the team play the objectives. It could be considered sort of a end-game luxury class although it's not hard to develop one.\n\nAll of the weapons, vehicles, soldier classes, ranks & uniforms have their own flavor on each of the 3 different factions right now. There will likely be more factions introduced in the future.\n\nThe vehicles differ between factions but that's not to say they are unbalanced, it's called asymmetrical balance. It would be very dull and no fun if all factions had everything the same. That said the game is still continuously being improved and this is not the final product although it's very polished and playable for a beta.\n\nIn addition unlocking vehicles is easy and not expensive. The ones that take the longest to unlock and are most expensive are probably the various tanks, some of the most pleasurable grind I experienced.\n\nMassive maps with a variety of conditions like times when the sun is low, night, foggy, etc.\n\nMoving between objectives you can go from cover to cover, flank, use your vehicle, use any bicycle or truck freely available through the map.\n\nFreedom for a variety of play styles given the nature of the game - tactical and/or stealthy, etc, while also encouraging players to be objective oriented which is most rewarding for the player and team.\n\nYou can't go from prone to crouch, probably a good thing not to emphasize too much the camping of one place only without moving. Not to mention when sniping it's always good measure to rotate spots every so often to not be predictable and give away position.\n\nSoldiers base salary depends on their level, can reach 3950 for a Colonel, granted for being on the battlefield for over 50% of the battle. Extra credits depend on battle participation. This means capturing & defending points, saving team mates, kills, etc. The use of explosives is expensive so that it remains as a valuable commodity to be used wisely. Although you will often see some using bazookas to kill infantry.\n\n3 types of currency:\n- Credits: Obtained every battle; Used to buy weapons, vehicles, to repair and maintain them.\n- Warfunds: earned in-battle & by AT's; Used to buy assault teams, deploy and resupply them.\n- Gold: earned (4) by finishing the 1st daily match and/or buying. Used to purchase anything.\n\nI have not paid during the +1,325 hours I've played and I have the feeling there's still things left for me to explore.\n\nLots of fun grind without feeling like a p2w as it's entirely optional to spend and you can be competitive without paying a penny. Players who do spend essentially get one extra perk and a bit of a boost grinding - not something that makes massive difference. Some of the perks are not as essential as they would seem, specially depending on your style of play. Additionally there's give-aways frequently enough from free gold, to veteran membership & ribbon boosters.\n\nThe game developers provide regular updates which is great. The game is still in beta but doesn't feel like it at all.\n\nDevelopers stream on Twitch every friday answering community questions and showing what they are working on, thus promoting a close relation with the community.\n\nFind a clan as this game benefits immeasurably from voice chat taking it to a totally different experience. Team playing the objectives takes the game to another level. It makes the learning much faster, you get to know the best practices, what works and what does not - faster & based on other players experience. Not to mention it's a whole lot of fun.\n\nIt's a good thing the game doesn't have in-game voice chat otherwise there would be too much noise from random players, new players, kids, music, etc. I'd rather a low noise environment where I can enjoy radio silence so it's possible to focus on the game environment sounds and listen only to short bytes of valuable information.\n\nThere's various clans most of which have open teamspeak servers freely available and widely publicized for anyone to join. You can literally just hop in a channel and join the battle.\n\nIs there space for improvement? Of course there always is. However the game is very playable and enjoyable as it is. I think it's an awesome game specially for the investment I've made on it - none.\n\nNo review can fully describe Heroes & Generals, you have to experience this.","May 5, 2015","true","325.0"," 114 of 167 people (68%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","68","114","167","15","17"

It takes up to three shots to kill when it is firing some fairly powerful rounds and your soldier fires it so slow, and in order to fire faster you have to pay. shame because this gun was a major reason why the allies won and should perform much better at its start (partly because Germans' start with a Gewher semi-automatic rifle that can fire almost x2 faster than the m1)\n2. grease gun=OP when in real life it was reserved mostly for a tank crew. this means that it was not very good except for very close range.\n\nUnder the trailers I believed that this was a WW2 type of Planetside 2 were there is always a battle with hundreds of players at once. NOPE it is the typical search for a game and spend 90 seconds to start. with only 30 or 40 people in a game for a 10 minute match. The maps are fairly large and your soldier can only run for a short time making traveling take a while considering that everytime you have to die you spawn at base. there is also this feature where you have to wait until a certain # of teamates to die (not a time respawn like other games, you have to wait for teamates to die which can take a while)\n\nin the end if you want a decent free to play game then this game is ok. if you want a realstic representaiton of WW2 then play Rising Storm, where guns perform semi accuartet to what they did at the time. and for flying i would assume that War Thunder is a better choice (even though that game has some flaws to) it is your typical free to play where if you want to get anywhere you have to pay. game has potential but needs some time\n","July 11, 2014","false","5.9"," 112 of 164 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","112","164","0","9"

Then it FORCES you into maps with people that have more skill, better weapons, etc.  Not only does it do that, but the maps it forces you into only has a limit of 20 players playing at once, which is still 10 v 10...on maps that are big enough for hundreds...HUNDREDS of players. Don't let the term 'MMOFPS' fool you...it's match based. This makes 'battle lines' almost non existant due to lack of troops. Seriously, 80 percent of the time I was killed, it was from behind during those maps, because it is SO easy to just walk around the objectives, and due to the size and amount of various types of foliage and terain in the way, no one would ever see you. Ever. Which makes snipers practically dominate...Oh, another thing...the bullet drop and speed of this game is...it's...it's just dumb. Not even 100 yards out and it just drops so hard, or the target moved out of the way because you know...apparently, you are playing with nerf darts in this game, that's how slow bullets travel.\n\nAnother thing is...If you are rank three and don't want to pay them money...you're going to get murdered by tanks and planes...a lot...because all you have is a rifle...which does nothing to them.

It's been in a "BETA" stage for almost 2 full years and the reasoning behind this is because they can hide their flaws behind that tag.\n\nThey continue to push new content that further breaks the balance of the game instead of fixing the issues they already have at hand but hey it's "BETA" so we have to deal with it.\n\nThe way I see it, as soon as you add any source of micro-transactions the game is already fully released, you can't consider it an "BETA" game anymore. Mostly because games that are in an Alpha stage tend to get wiped after that stage. So once you've added micro-transactions, unless you plan on reimbursing your paying players than it's just utterly wrong.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game to anyone unless you enjoy being frustrated everytime you play.

The FPS and RTS are tied together by the gamemode, War.\n\nThe FPS side of things starts with 3 guys. A Russian, German, and American. All your guys start out with a Semi-Automatic rifle. SVT-40,(Russian) Gewehr 43 (German), and the M1 Garand (USA). Make no mistake, these guns are very good, though they are your starter guns. They can be modded it 2 hit kill, and fast firing. But I would not recommend doing this until you have a larger income, because the repairs will take away some of your earnings.\n\nThe game has a wide range of weapons, from S-A rifles and bolt actions, to Submachinguns and Assault Rifles.\nYou progress by getting XP on ribbions, and these ribbions progress through levels, at which on each level you may unlock something.\n\nI can not really say too much about the RTS side of the game, as I've just started to play it, and as such am figuring it out . ;)\nThere are two kinds of currency in this game, Credits, and Gold. Gold is bought with real life money, and Credits are earned through the FPS side of game. Anything ingame can be bought with credits, Even Veteran (Premium) memberships. You earn credits by hour, so time in battle, not just in the spawn menu, but actually in the battle.\nAs you gain a higher rank soldier you will get a higher salary, thus earn more money.\n\nNormal Problems People Have.\n\n.) The match maker is unfair.\n\nNo, its not really. In staged, both teams have the exact same things availible to them. Same number of tanks, planes, infantry, paratroopers, they all have the same. So why do I end up ingame agaisnt a team with 5 tanks, when we have 0 you ask? Nobody has used them. Its that simple. Both teams have the same thing open to them, but its up to the players to use them. So if somebody has a tanker, but does not use it you won't have tanks.\n\n.) Its P2W (Pay too Win)\n\nI would call it P2P: Pay too Progress. Anything, anything ingame, can be bought with credits, meaning that its not P2W.\nAlways remember, the strenght of a player lies not in the weapon, but in the seat. To roughly quote a person on the forums.\n\n.) The grind is sooooo long. I've seen a person with 3.2 hours say it take eternity to get something. Well, in a way. I won't lie to you, the grind is long, it is hard, and it will take a long time. But once you have that new gun, tank or what ever it is you want, it all seems damn worth it.\n\n.) This game is full of cheaters and hackers.\n\nIt was. Once. But the Devs have done a good job of weeding out the bad, and keeping the good. Many people call hacks simply because they are not very good at the game. I once had a newer guy tell me that he was worried he would be accused for hacking because he was 12-5. It is sad when people are afread of being reported for a simple thing like that.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are some hackers out there, but over 900 hours, I have only seen 1, maybe 2. Most people are just really good.\n\n\n.)The game is unfair once I reach level 5.\n\nOnce you reach level 5 you will be thrown in agaisnt the very best. Tanks, paras, recon with 1 hit kill rifles, fighters constantly dropping bombs on your head. It will all seem very hard, and it is a learning curve, but give it time and stick to it, and soon you will be one of those vets that others complian about. ;) Once you hit level 5, you WILL die alot, but its a game, try not to rage too much. Just respawn and try again.\n\nPros\n-Its free\n-Not P2W\n-Has a lot of stuff to chose from, like Paratroopers, Tankers, Recon, Fighter Pilots, and General. (NOTE: General can not play FPS side of game)\n-Balanced\n-Still activly being developed\n-3 factions to choose from\n\nCons\n-Long grind\n-Will die quite a bit\n-Quite a bit of whiny people who can't handle getting killed. ;)\n-It has a few bugs here and there\n-Flight controls feel a bit off to me, but I never got used to them\n-Explosives, and weapon mods are a bit expensive to maintain until you get a higher rank.\n\nTips\n.)Don't come in as a know it all.\n\nJust because you might play games like CoD and CS:GO does not mean you know all there is to know. This is a different style of game, slower and more realistic.\n\n.)Listion to the veteran guys.\n\nThey have more time played, and are better at it. If they give you advice, take it, try it, and if it doesn't work for you, thats OK. And don't be afread to ask for help either.\n\n.) Always remember its a game, and should not interfear with real life duties. Nor take it to hard if you die.\n\n.) Please, when disscusing something about how hard something is or all that, remember that all of us where there, all of us were "noobs".\n\n.)Respect the devs, as they put a lot of work into this, and none of us really can say that they are doing a bad job, or need to do this or that fully, because almost, if not none of us have ever made a PC game like this.\n\n.)Don't act like a know-it-all.\n\nHave a nice day, and I hope this was of help!\n\n~CaptainRA11","March 4","true","323.3"," 251 of 392 people (64%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","64","251","392","25","33"

Since the Steam release they are working a lot harder to make this game better, after all - the more money they get from the game, the more it will inspire the developers to create more & better content.\n\nThey are holding Devstreams weekly, instead of monthly, they show off great features that are coming, or have arrived. Several great builds have already been created in the 9 months Steam release, and it DOES make a significant change for the better with each update.\n\nThere are 5 classes in general in it, that you can switch to,  after gaining a certain amount of XP with your main. You can then swap to that new 'rank' (or buy one individually from the store):\nInfantry, Tanker, Airforce, Paratrooper, Recon - for a fee with money you earn in-game.\n\nEach class adds a new playing style to the game, they are highly useful,\nespecially if they are skilled players & know how to play the game/class.\n\nThere is also a general class, which does not participate in battles, but uses 'tickets' to send divisions to areas on the campaign map, which will then create campaign battles which the 'normal' players have to fight, and this in turn will alter the course of the war.\n\nThere are great authentic weapons & vehicles that further enhances the flavour, the sounds however, can still be improved upon - though they sound better now, they can still use an overhaul.\n\nSome maps are quite huge, in comparison with other WW2 MPs,\nand some are small, but they are all decently crafted & enjoyable.\n\nSome character generation might not go astray,\nbut it's probably not necessary (for now at least).\n\nI cannot wait to see what this game has in store for the future.\n\nI urge you to see past the grindiness that this (& every F2P MMO) has,\nand you will learn that you like it, at least, give it that try - it deserves it!\n\nPersonal score: 7.5/10\n\nBest regards,\nDukhat","December 24, 2014","true","704.9"," 120 of 178 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","120","178","6","8"

Apparently of all the things to fix being repeatedly bombed upon spawning is bottom of the developers list. If you enjoy unending frustration, a lack of common sense in game design philosophy, and general annoyance you should definitely download Heroes and Generals. Otherwise I would suggest giving this one a pass.\n\nFor a free game Heroes and Generals is pretty polished however the balancing and gameplay issues will fairly well ensure that your enjoyment of the game is crippled almost immediately. The developers seem to have a fierce love of placing spawn points in open fields with little to no cover. When you spawn you have approximately four seconds of invulnerability (coupled with no sprint) after which you will be fair game for the snipers or tanks that park around these kill farms.\n\nIf you play the game you will need to join Germany as they seem to have the largest bank roll which allows them to steamroll the US in each 'war' which always last about three days. More funds mean more tanks and planes for the German side. The German plane is especially frustrating as their initial fighter is both smaller and more manueverable than the American fighter. In theory this is made up for by the fact that the German plane carries only a single bomb compared to the American's two however there are medals in the game which will allow a plane to carry up to three additional bombs. Couple this with the fact that the bombs are on a cooldown rather than being limited availability and the Germans rapidly deplete the American plane reserves and then begin bombing everything into dust.\n\nThe game tried to put some clever ideas into play by letting the highest level players (Generals) retire to command battles. They have warfunds which can be used to purchase assault teams, vehicles, and reinforce battles that are occurings. This seems like it would be entertaining but unfortunately you run into a lot of matches where one side is completely outgunned. Matches with all infantry versus a well-supplied armor or fighter group end in tears rather wiftly and brutally. Balancing the forces fighting comes second to the 'strategy' of swarming your opponents with more vehicles.\n\nMysteriously the developers refuse to patch obvious imbalances and instead concern themselves with fixing game types that aren't broken. The typical game mode involves one side needing to hold a series of control points for 30 minutes. Previously once the 30 minute window ended the game was over and the successful defenders could claim victory. Now, however, even if the defenders hold out they must still reclaim all of the original command points before they can secure victory. The attackers in the mean time do not suffer any noticeable downside to failing in their objective.\n\nAll in all there is fun to be had in H&G but it is a fun you will have to fight tooth and nail for against a tide of poor balancing and questionable design philosophy.","October 10, 2014","false","58.3"," 97 of 141 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","97","141","0","0"

I hate that each update dumbs the game down to nothing more than a 'Red Vs. Blue' shoot 'em up that even the most mindless of FPS player would find too simple.\n\n2. I hate that the devs cater to people who complain en mass over something they don't like (getting sniped) and implement something totally stupid to counter it (tracer rounds that can be seen clearly even in the day time)\n\n3. I hate that good suggestions (medics, better flight models, proper tank physics, realistic damage to tank tracks, plane cockpit view, different uniforms as you go up in rank, deployable bipods, tank cupola view and so on) have been seemingly neglected.\n\n4. I hate that rather than fix something or make it the best they can (e.g. Tanks) the devs just introduce more of said broken item.\n\n5. I hate that after 3 years+ of development we still have one campaign, guns sound like they are firing paintballs, tanks flip when running into bicycles and come to a complete stop when hitting a simple wooden fence and much more.\n\n6. I hate that maps are so big and empty with no ambiance, no destruction and nothing that makes me remotely think I'm in a war.\n\n7. I hate the new weight system and how totally absurd it is (a grease gun weighing as much as a Thompson, a scoped Kar 98 weighing less than a regular Kar 98)\n\n8. I hate that it took them so long to bring back paratroopers, and have essentially made them useless by giving them only 6 equipment slots, barely enough to equip anything. Even though paratroopers in WW2 were fitter and carried almost triple the equipment of a regular soldier.\n\n9. I hate that the FG42 is listed as an LMG and has the same weight as an MG42 when it is comparable in size and weight to a modern assault rifle.\n\n10.

Terrible economy. Pay 2 Win walls..\n\nI gave this game a chance because it started out with a good concept. As I have progressed in the game I have come to the conclusion that it is indeed pay to win. The game isn't retaining any skilled players due to it's high turnover rate resulting in boring and often stupid game play. There is little to no strategy in the game other than to purchase in game fighting groups which are then defeated using an auto resolution system that favors the player who has spent more money. There are few matches to play other than during the peak hours. After playing this game for several hours and hearing a lot of disappointment from fellow veteran players who have invested in the game would not recommend this game to anyone.\n\nEDIT: Played Updated version..\n\nCampaign map is plagued by people with alternate accounts starting matches and quitting. The strategy portion of this game is being exploited still. Over-stacking units on towns using assault teams purchased with money allows players to win using only CASH. Wars end in a couple days and  developers continue to do nothing about these issues. Game is full of idiots who do not know how play and people who exploit the system..\n\nEDIT: V-Update or Vasilevski\n\nNo  changes to the warfund economy and grind walls have been raised even higher. A player's time is not respected requiring you to cough up money to progress or spend ridiculous amount of time earning currency to pay for repairs on things you already unlocked. Some optimization updates have improved fps for some players, although playerbase is currently furious with the developers as they refuse to listen to warnings from their core testing group regarding game breaking changes. Economy is still ♥♥♥♥ and you have to play/connect to 7-8 battles to possibly have one enjoyable match...\n\nEDIT: Adams/Bauer Update\n\nFiring mechanics have been altered, gun play is sub par, the strategy portion of the game is dependent on players whom all of which are grinding for gear still 2 years later. I've unlocked everything in the game for free and never spent a cent. This is probably why I get stupid replies from support chat when I contact them to ban trolls and griefers. Most players are total ♥♥♥♥ and the game rewards them for running around and doing nothing, veteran players use multiaccounts to manipulate the war map and sabotage matches due to their poor playing ability.

Great models, though. Dozens of weapons, and everything from bicycles, to planes, to tanks. You choose your loadout. Generous weapon customization. Good, big maps, with open and urban combat. Bullet drop counts. The RTS side of the game is well-done. You can whistle. Great for casual players. The devs drink beer on their Twitch streams.\n\nCons?\n\nThe grinding can be painful, monetization is rampant, and some things are unrealistic to the point where I think I'll cry. One game mode, no shortage of bugs, and room for improvement just about everywhere. The devs seem ignorant to requests that have been up for years. Old bugs remain unfixed.\n\nBut don't fret! Hereos and Generals has a lot of potential. Yes, the bugs can be annoying, but fixes are coming! The hit detection, for one, has gotten so, so much better. We'll see a Russian faction in the next major update, and updates dedicated to fixing bugs after that. The game has gone through some hard years, yes, but it's pulling through.\n\nAs for the player base... it's alright, I suppose.

Of course the rifles can actually be pretty good when upgraded but will always fall short to the infamous SMGs. With a steady aim and a good sense of bullet drop you can pull off kills at long ranges with SMGs easier than with a rifle. And despite being a "tactical shooter" I've noticed that the stupidest and most suicidal plans actually succeed and often yield great rewards for your insanity. As per my studies, a bicycle ambush through forests very rarely fail. On higher level matches vehicles can play a pretty good role, but in simple skirmishes you'll find a poor ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who bought the jeep running around with a full truck only to have the entire crew mowed down by yolo-rushing SMG troopers. Don't get me wrong, the game is no Anti-Christ; but rather a brilliant consortium of amazingly effective yet horrible strategies that are quite entertaining. If there was a middle ground for reviews I'd probably be dead in the center.\n\nEDIT: So apparently they are sorting people by "Tier". These Tiers break the community between the Tier 1-Noobs and the Tier 2-Everyone Else. Given this sorting system, the second you hit Tier 2 you are thrown into matches with super high level players. I've been playing for three days and now I'm being put against people who have been playing for a year. This means that instead of having a close fight with someone with a similar weapon as yourself, you will be sniped by Thompsons, mowed down with upgraded BARs, blown up by tanks, and bombed by aeroplanes.  Oh where have the good days gone?\nDon't even get me started on weapon balancing.\n\nOfficial rating: 5/10. Would be raised by fixing of major issues.","February 6, 2015","false","18.2"," 169 of 261 people (65%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","65","169","261","106","5"

For the first few hours this game is awesome, you drive around in cars, you fight against people your level with guns your level, and its an amazing game.\n\nThen comes level 3. After level 3 the matchmaking turns to complete crap, matching you against either p2w f***, or just people who have played longer. If you're still using the default gun you will constantly be getting killed. Your gun takes 2-3 hits to kill an enemy while most guns either one shot or kill you so fast you think its a one shot, then you get sent back to spawn, spend 10-30 seconds deploying, drive/walk back, get one shotted, repeat. Doesn't that sound like fun!!!??? And if you're not getting killed by better players, you're matched up against tanks, which are 10 times worse. They camp across the map, and shoot shells that hit your general vicinity to kill you. If you're in a jeep or convoy car, all of you will instantly be killed. The player in the tank is invincible to bullets, and the only way to kill them is with anti-tank weapons, which are expensive and are also hard to get. But, the game has to have tanks. You cant have a WWII war game without tanks, the problem is that you only need to be level 3 to be a tank driver, meaning that every game will have up to 10 tanks camping across the map destroying any infantry. In assault its a little better becuase there are planes that counter them, but what the game should really do is remove tanks from skirmish modes, where they are safe from their #1 enemy (fighter pilots cant play skirmish)\n\nLet's move on to the economy. Every time you use a grenade in the battle you have to pay for it. You also have to pay for your gun ammo, vehicle repair costs, and gun maintenance. Now, usually its not very much, but once you try to upgrade your weapons you start gaining very little credits per game. Any half decent gun costs $50,000+ credits, meaning that you have to play constantly to get these weapons. The game probably gets better once you get the better weapons, but I have 65 hours into the game and still have trash weapons. I'm not putting myself through the torture of playing more so I can get better weapons.\n\n[EDIT 1]: Oops! Silly me, I forgot about one of the most important things! You might be thinking "Okay, this game is in Beta, it still has potential, right?" Well, this latest update made me think wrong. The Soviet Union was added as a faction (team) to the game. Now, first of all, for the majority of the war the U.S. and the Soviet Union were allies, although tensions were still high, but they wouldn't attack each other, but who cares about that. I dont. What I do care about is the fact that they made the Soviet Union a frickin' powerhouse, their infantry weapons are far superior; especially the PPD-40. The PPD is a 71 round mag smg. Compared to the M3 Grease gun and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MP34, its totally op. The next smg you get is the PPsH. Once again, 71 round mag, upgradable to 900 rpm (rounds per minute). 71 shots at 900 rpm = op.\n\n[EDIT 2]: As you can see, my hours have raised since I wrote this review. Now, this is not because I'm a hypocrite, its becuase my little brother hasn't realized that this game is not a good game, and everyday forces me to play with him. Once he realizes, just like me, that this is not a good game, I will have no reason to play it.\n\n[EDIT 3]: Let's also talk about AT (Anti-Tank). Tanks in this game are completely unbalanced, especially in skirmish, but at least the developers were kind enough to give us infantry a way to kill tanks. Mines, sticky grendes, and rocket launchers. For grenades and mines, you have to be right up near the tank, which is impossible to do if they are camping or have infantry guarding them. Rocket launchers are a little bit better, but they take up so much inventory space you can only cary a SA-rifle or a BA-rifle, and you can barely sprint. The other thing is that the game doesn't want people destroying tanks, so they make the AT weapons so overpriced they are literally unusable. Sticky grenades are the best example. It takes 3 sticky grenades to destroy a tank. The cost of using 3 sticky grenades is 1100 credits. (average salary per game = 3000-5000 credits). You are paying a large chunk of your salary to destroy one tank, and the tank driver has to pay maybe 100-500.\n\n[EDIT 4]: One other thing. The game's matchmaking sometimes decides to match you in a game that is already almost over, meaning you will automatically be paid 0 credits. If you are like me and your gun is very expensive to maintain, you are losing alot of money by playing.","March 8, 2015","false","162.7"," 124 of 187 people (66%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","66","124","187","22","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zGarmin/recommended/227940/","zGarmin","zGarmin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zGarmin/","199 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTL;DR: For anyone who is interested in the quick and dirty I do not recommend this game because of three things: Uneven Economic model, 'flawed' Matchmaking and only 'Average' FPS gameplay. However, if your interested in more grinding than a Gentleman's club then this is the game for you. Anyone else should exercise extreme caution.\n\nWith that out of the way, this is from the perspective of a relatively 'new player' so I will be wrong on some stuff.\n\nThere is also a massive disconnect between players that are mid-tier or higher in comparison to the experiences that new players are having. With generally the newer player not having much fun at all because of "reasons".\n\n________________________________\n\nEconomics & Progression System:\n\nIt's a broken mess. The costs are simply too much for an average player / casual player to stomach.\n\nExample 1: Let's play 'Avoid the tank!'\n\nM1A1 Bazooka - 28,400 Credits\nCorporal Salary - 1,450 Credits\n\nYou are looking at nearly 20 battles. Now, assuming that each battle lasts around 20 minutes you are looking at investing 400 minutes to buy one item. Whereas if you spend 329 gold ($2.15 assuming basic $9.16 gold package (s) of 1400 gold) you can skip that grind and actually have fun in combined arms battles.\n\nNow this is where the first cracks appear. When you start off, you are incapable of hurting enemy tanks unless you spend RL money or nearly 7 hours grinding it out for the 'ability' to hurt enemy tanks.\n\nThis means, that until you do so, you are automatically forced into two options without it: Disengage or be killed.\n\nThis is the most painful example in the game of the broken economic model. For those first 7 hours the game is almost unbearable to play as it is simply no fun for those times that you do come up against enemy tanks. This is where I expect most players to give-up because the game has not shown there is more to it than grinding.\n\nExample 2: You want to play the Strategy side too? Too bad. Money naow!\n\n2nd Lieutenant Minimum - I cannot tell you how much because they don't want you to know. I'm not joking, they deliberately conceal it on their Wikia\n(http://heroesandgenerals.gamepedia.com/Ranks#XP_Levels).\n\nYou have to take me at my word here, the XP costs get so absurd that you shouldn't even try to grind this one out. You will simply be shocked at how much XP you will need to grind out in order to play with an entire half of the game. This means that your hand is being forced to pay 1,699 Gold ($11.10 assuming basic $9.16 gold package (s) of 1400 gold) in order to play with this section of the game if you have any kind of interest in advanced matchmaking, assault teams mechanics or grand strategy.\n\nEconomics & Progression Conclusion:\n\nWhile it is possible to play with only a standard account and participate in lower tier missions until you are ready to take part in more advanced missions you are seriously limiting what the game has to offer. The reality is that in order get the maximum value out of your time in H&G you will need Membership status if only for the +50% credits in order to access the things that make the game cool: Weapon Mods, Vehicles, Assault Teams and that extra badge slot.\n\nOn a seperate note, in order to access an entire half of the game that has effectively been gated off with Pay Walls, you will need to spend money to play with the very cool mechanics of Assault Teams one way or another. Either through Membership or purchasing a character of that rank or higher.\n\n________________________________\n\nMatchmaking: Let's club some seals\n\nLet's start off with the basics: Never touch 'Random Battle' ever. Don't do it. Ever.\n\nIf you are new to the game, for the love of gawd click 'Find Mission' and click resources. After that try to find ones that don't include tanks and aircraft. This is the beauty and the sheer horror of the matchmaking system here, new players can get into battles with seasoned veterans who have played thousands of hours and are far ahead of the curve when it comes to advancement. This is even more evident in combined-arms battles. Avoid these at all costs.\n\nThat's the problem with the matchmaker, it doesn't match you on skill or Soldier advancement. As far as I understand it's completely random and your playing with fire every time you use it.\n\nMatchmaking Conclusion:\n\nIt's not so bad if you manually select your games so that the disparity of force between you and your fellow players is minimized. It's a lot more fun having the ability to shoot an enemy soldier rather than being forced to throw grenades at an enemy tank out of desperation.\n\nThe key problem is that there is NO explanation of the matchmaking system and what drives it in-game which shoehorns new players that don't know any better into bad gameplay experiences.\n\n________________________________\n\nThe FPS side: 'Average' is not good, 'average' is actually bad guise\n\nWhen broken down into it's core components, the FPS gameplay is merely average. I'm sorry but there's no way of going about this without hurting someone's feelings. Average is actually bad because it doesn't offer either refinement or innovation. The FPS mechanics are average that it reminds me of Battlefield 1942 from all the way back in 2004. That's not a good sign when we're talking about a game in August 2014.\n\nAside from a merely average FPS portion of the game, what is there for a new player to really do? Answer: Nothing. Unless you count grinding. Which I don't.\n\nThe FPS mechanics are middle of the road, meaning that they are the same as the vast majority of the rest of the other FPS' games out there. The only fundamental difference is that the lobby system for this game has some advanced mechancis that the average player doesn't have a hope of ever touching unless they pay for it.\n\nThis sameness' is exacerbated even further when you realize that there are huge problems with the game server. The entire game is basically being run on a single server and there are massive problems with hit detection. Doesn't make for the best gaming experience when your perfectly aimed shots are sliding off a target at times.\n\nThe FPS Side Conclusion:\n\nThere's nothing here we have not already seen but better. I will admit that I value Gameplay over Graphics. But the graphical fidelity of this game is on par with Battlefield 1942.\n\nOverall Conclusion:\nWhen you get down to the brass tacks of H&G - The concept of being able to play the strategic side and the tactical side in a Theatre of War is a very intriguing possibility but that's all it is at this point. A concept. H&G at this current stage is nothing more than a patchwork of microtransactions with a game concept slapped on. There is almost no incentive for the new player to stick around and be brow beaten for hours.\n\nHowever, in the end it comes down to one important question; does the player want to spend time or money to access the one interesting part of the game - Assault Teams?\n\nLinks:\nhttp://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=17&t=22530 <-Community EXP feedback\nhttp://forum.heroesandgenerals.com/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=22561 <-Why H&G is unfair for new players\n\n\nCautionary: This is a review for a beta game and as the game is subject to frequent change, this review will be further and further out of date.","September 1, 2014","false","13.4"," 45 of 57 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","45","57","0","10"

If you wish to sit and read it all then I suggest you grab yourself a snack.\n\nThis game is a ton of fun. I have had more crazy moments in this game than any other PC game. In no other game do I get the same feeling then when I entice a tanker out of his tank only to kill him and steal it and go on a rampage to turn the tide of the battle. I have had many moments like that in this game. However, this game is by no means perfect and has some very noticeable flaws.\n\nLet's start with the positives.\n\n-As I mentioned earlier this game can really make you feel as though you are the hero of the battle. While this feeling is not necessarily consistent throughout the game, when it hits there just isn't anything quite like it.\n\n-There is a decent amount of content in the game. As of the time of review there are about eight guns available for an infantryman in each faction and different guns for each faction. Add onto that more gun mods than I care to count with multiple choices in ammunition, trigger, various internals, sights, and different skins. In addition to all that you can chose to load up with various mines and grenades as well as knives. And that is just the infantry. In this game you can also play as a tanker, a fighter pilot, a paratrooper, or as a dedicated sniper. Each having additional, more specialized equipment.\n\n-Flowing from the previous point this game has some pretty diverse gameplay. One minute you are holding off an enemy tank assault. The next you are pushing forward to cap one of their command posts. The next you are using Anti Air guns to shoot down the fighters harassing your allied tanks. All of this from the point of a lowly infantryman, not even beginning to scratch the surface of what you can do in the game.\n\n-The graphics, while not very impressive on the technical side, are aesthetically pleasing. The art itself is clean and very consistent. Nothing in the game looks out of place. There are a few issues with z fighting in a few maps, but they are only noticeable in extreme top-down aerial views and not noticeable during gameplay.\n\n-The developers of the game are very active with the community. They listen to complaints and suggestions. In addition they post a fair amount of news to their site and host dev streams to show off the features they plan on adding to the game.\n\nUnfortunately that brings us to the negatives.\n\n-This game is not very friendly to new players. With a mildly confusing UI, no immediately apparent tutorials (one does exist, but you have to search for it), and the possibility of entering a match with highly experienced players leads to a frustrating experience for people just starting the game.\n\n-Once again building off the previous point, the game's grind can be very long. There are ways you can shorten it significantly without paying a dime, but they require a fair amount of research and in the end only shorten, not eliminate, the sizable grind.\n\n-Additionally this game has some interesting bugs. They range from oddities like semi auto guns occasionally firing twice with only one mouse click to stuff like backpacks being visible through walls. The devs have mentioned that they are working on fixing these issues, just be aware that they exist and that this game will probably have a few more bugs during its development.\n\n-Again building off the previous point, the game suffers from some serious performance issues. Unfortunately, I run the game on a laptop so low framerates are to be expected, but many members of the community report less than ideal frame rates on their systems.\n\n-Finally, there are currently, what I find to be, a decent amount of maps in the game with the promise of more being added in future updates. That said, many building and environment assets are copy pasted throughout them all, giving the maps a repetitive feeling.\n\nAll of that said, I find that the positives far outway the negatives. This game is very enjoyable, especially given the fact that it is free.","October 16, 2015","true","185.5"," 61 of 84 people (73%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","73","61","84","10","1"

I love the concept as well as the throw back to old WWII shooters like call of duty and battlefield 1942. There are forever a few major flaws in the game which I cannot stand.\n\n1. The game progression is way too slow. You are barely rewarded for kills so I tried spending most of my time capturing points. But even with a descent KD ratio and number of caps, I only seem to get 200-300 XP out of a game. Since it takes 6000XP to reach level 4 from 3 and the class I am interested in (paratroopers) requires level 7 the grind is just too long.\n\n2. The action moments are few and far between. This game is a lot of fun when you get on a kill streak and you are working as a team. But I spend most of my time respawning, running between shortness of breaths and getting killed almost as soon as I get in the fight. Taking a jeep only makes you a bigger target from what I've experienced.\n\n3. Unbalanced. You cannot have fun when you are up against tanks, snipers, and dive bombers when all you have is an M1.\n\n4. Unintuitive. There are a lot of things that don't make sense. For example why can't you switch loadouts between deaths? If the loadout isn't working in a certain scenario i.e. against tanks, why can't I change my loadout or character?\n\n5. Clunky movement. The movement is not meant to be crisp like bf4 or cod, I get it. But I think ithe responsiveness is excessively slow. slowing down, jumping, even running into a doorway is difficult in this game.\n\n6. Money. Just like the latest episode of South Park on fremium games: this game is barely fun unless you sink money into it to get the good weapons and classes.\n\nThe game is still in beta and I hope some of these issues will be addressed. But as it stands now, I find the game rather unenjoyable.

I am not a hardcore FPS gamer, but rather a strategist at heart. I found the concept of this game to be very interesting and my initial feelings for the game were relatively positive. However, since the recent update drastically reduces a new players ability to aquire experience in a reasonable fashion, I must give this game a negative review. It is quite sad, because this game does have potential and can be quite fun; but spending hour after hour grinding for experience with little to show for your efforts will hamper a beginning players desire to continue to play. I sincerly hope that the ribbon system will be reverted back to something more reasonable, and I will give this game about two more weeks for the devs to correct this issue. If nothing happens I won't waste any more of my valuable time playing this game. If any devs see this post know that the recent update will surely cost you not only players, but revenue as well. For example, given my initial feelings for the game I was about to buy some gold and invest in war bonds. Luckily for me, I had not done so before the update. As the game is now I would never spend any money on purchasing anything!!!!!!!\nI can not recomend this game to any new players who either do not want to spend a fortune or simply do not have an endless amount of time to grind to reach the desired rank, weapons, or perks etc. If something changes to improve my perception of the game I will change this review.","June 4, 2015","false","564.9"," 50 of 66 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","50","66","0","0"

Do you like it when free to play games have a pay to win model? Do you go weak in the knees when you can throw $50 at a game and instantly be overpowered? Then this is the game for you. The way the game works is that you unlock better guns, attachments, and vehicles by leveling and when you que for a match, you only play against people of your level. However, you can just buy the better ♥♥♥♥ and still get matched against lower level people. So if you don't pay money like those people, you'll get destroyed and be told the only way to fight against them is to buy the better ♥♥♥♥. Does the enemy have a guy that bought a tank? Then I hope you bought the anti tank weapon or you can't hurt him. Did some dude on the enemy team buy a high end sniper with an awesome scope? Hope you also have one or you won't be able to run across the big open field to the next objective.The game doesn't even try to match these people with other pay to win people, so you can get games where you have no tanks or planes at all.\n\nGun play is solid when you actually get people of your level with appropriate equipment, and I had a lot of fun using the whistling feature to communicate with teammates as we stalked through the forest together looking for enemies as we made our way to the next objective. However, the fun is instantly killed when someone on the enemy team goes ripping through the forest with a truck they bought, jumps out, and starts spraying you with an lmg while the dude on the back of the truck is spraying you with the lmg on the truck.\n\nTL;DR?\nGun play is solid, and the game has fun mechanics but it is instantly ruined by a brutal pay to win model that is going to kill the game very quickly. 2/10, would not recommend","October 1, 2014","false","41.6"," 68 of 96 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","68","96","0","0"

Yeah, it will take time and so on, but after you get what u want it feels great, as well better stuff won't make you play better(i bought scope with gold and found out that i suck with it, while with iron sight i'm pretty good.) so only thing what recomend is veteran, it will give you some exp boost(it is if you like game)\n\n2 You will die a lot, at least in begining, till you learn how to play, well i still die a lot, but i make some enemy players die a lot too :D what i meant is, head shoots, grenades, road kill - in time it may feel unfair, but you will learn how to stay alive long enough to take out 2 enemy tanks with panzer-snacker, kill rogue sniper and steal their stuff :D\n\n3 i have heard that game have cheaters and ect. But as far i can tell, it have some skilled players too, and by investing time in it, not cash you can be one of them :)\n\n4 grind, yeah, you can say it's grind fest, but which mmo isn't? And i will put it simple, if you like game, that grind won't matter for you, cose as you play you unlock stuff and as like i said, better stuff won't make you better(i'm rank 5 infantry, loving my starter G43, taking out higher rank players with their ‘’uber’’ guns, just need to play smart)\n\n5 HaG, is not your standard FPS, you run straight to enemy- you die, you try to be next ‘’rembo’’ - you die, try to take out tank with standard grenades - die, so what you do is flank, take cover, prone, run in z style, use mother earth as your ally, report snipers to your team-mates, play as team, use suppres fire, smoke them out with grenades etc\n\n6 you start out with 1 loadout, after a while you can customise to your playstyle, found what works for you\n\n7 game isn't for all, especially not for 10-14 years old cry babies or short temper ppl and impatient persons. You need to take time with this one, take it slowly, set your goals and work hard to get them.\n\nMy first impression.\n\nWhen i picked it up i didn't like it, i meant i died instantly in all possible ways, headshot, legshot, torso shot, roadkill, grenades…. And that money shop.. I with my friend was like, it's p2w, you can't do ♥♥♥♥ without paying rlm, enemy is op (playing as german and german only), and so on. But as we played we wanted to see how THE big war looks and we aimed to get on rank 5 and on the way till rank 5 some changes happen, not to game, to our playstyle … i stopped to run straight on enemy positions, stopped to stand up or still in 2v1 fights, stopped to aim for most kills, instead i start helping team in big picture. Capture objective points, kill rogue snipers, defend our points and so on… and the more i kept playing the more i enjoyed game, like now if i can get 1 good match out of 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ones it's worth it and the atmosphere of game are perfect, airplanes roaming sky, tanks rolling over land and me as infantry in middle of it all :)\n\n+  one can customise his character to his play style (be brave, be sneaky, be tanker, be pilot and so on)\n+ rewarding unlock system what responds to your playstyle\n+ great game to play with your friends (make a squad and you can team crush your opponent)\n+ think your enemy have better guns? Kill him and pick it up to see for yourself\n+ game strongly rewards team play and tends to punish rambo wannabe’s\n+ nicely done progression system which will make you busy\n+ good use of repair system which won't allow to spam op equipment( could be more balanced though)\n+ for f2p game are well balanced, u can get all what you need with ingame money, what leads to point where your opponent can't have something what You can't have (well it will take time, but then again more you play this game, more better you will become)\n\n-  vet. Bonus is overpriced, i need to spend 15£ to get it, so yeah, devs should make it down on 5£, cose i personally don't like to use gold, it's make me feel cheap\n- only 2 tier system, so after you get rank 5 game kicks you out in big pot with high skilled players what makes it feel unfair sometimes, they could add tier 3 and and let tier 2 be mid ground for lvl 5-6 or 5-7 players to get around of things or something like that..\n- game isn't friendly for new players, i mean if they don't get how to play it in first 10h they will leave it cause if you try to play it as regular shooter you will lick bottom forever…\n- no training grounds for tankers, pilots and ect … i mean, i would love to see what is what before i spend shitloud of my hard earned in game cash to switch my infantrymen on different branches, so that should be fixed..\n- upper point and some other design choices tend to lightly hint on more cash in, then delivering most to players enjoyment and it's sad.\n\nFor dev ….\n\nI got it, that one needs earn money to keep supporting game and making it better, but if one truly says that they have players first before cash in you should fix some things, first make it separate vet. buying option, so one can spend ~5£ to get vet. Not 15£ to get vet and leftover gold.(one day saw over 10k players on steam, if half have a vet it's already reasonable cash on month) In my opinion it would be nice sub model for beta game and still would make money. As Well player should be able to see all clases himself in advanced training so they know what they are getting because now it's buying cat in bag…\n\nP.S.\n\nGreat game, eager to see it expand and become better:) 8/10","March 13","true","168.1"," 95 of 142 people (67%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","67","95","142","9","4"

I started playing this game, when you had just US vs. Germany. And when tanks had just 4 categories, no tiers in each category. When both faction had different starting weapons and faction bound AT weapons. Ah yes, the unfair battles between the US and Germany. Sadly, US still have too much good stuff while Germany got too much nerfed, i mean, the US gets a third LMG while the Germans get a...third pistol. No joke. And the Soviets are lacking in many areas, tanks are few and not great, their weapons needs love and overall shortage of stuff. And the game have still only one plane for the pilots of each faction, imbalancing it more as each faction plane have different problems while the soviet plane Yak-9 is just too good, even more when you consider, that all planes have the same damn engine.\n\nThe handling of game mechanics is a joke with the Dev Team, they don't listen to the community and are not giving answers in their own forum. They managed much, but the problem is, that are too many designers in the team, not programmers. Which explains some weird hitboxes on some tanks and the sideskirts of the Pz4 are bugged, causing self destruction by obstacles, look it up on Youtube if you don't believe me. Spawning is another problem like the team balancing, just cruel almost.\n\nThe devs are changing gold/credit prices after their own tastes, without notes in their patches! Don't invest money in it, the devs must start working for it, if they want it. I don't recommend this from my heart. I loved this game once, but this love is long gone, since the broken promises of Squad 2.0 and Armor 2.0 will never come.","May 5","false","266.6"," 60 of 84 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","60","84","2","7"

I have been playing this game for a long time, before GreenLight was introduced, before anyone might even think it will be on Steam. Since all that time, I lost the count of years that passed. The game remained in nearly the same stage it used to be. Graphics are as bad as they were, and so are the sounds, and the rest as well. Free players can play, but will encounter so many obstacles, they are most likely to bounce off of them, and stop playing. Everything is so expensive, it takes ages to grind for, unless you pay with real cash. If you pay, you can have everything straight away + extra slot for weapon, and extra slot for a bage, otherwise... Want a weapon? No problem, grind till death. Want to upgrade your weapon? No problem, grind till death.  Want new character, or more slots for them? No problem, grind till death. Want a vehicle, or more slots for them? No problem, grind till death. One of the features in this game is possibility to have assault team, but you will rather die of the old age, than ever have one. As long as everyone remembers, Americans were always OP with the M1 Garands, now Germans have Gewehrs 43 to counter them, but still M1 Garand owns. Previously it was M1 Garand against Kar98k. Spawn ♥♥♥♥ is present, just as it was before. Take a tank and park it in front of the enemy base. 10/0, 20/0, 30/0, 40/0 etc., such stats of the tank crew are not rare to see. The team with the tank wins the game in 99.99%.\n\n/Edit.\n\nRecent update introduced new nation, Russia. I cant tell anything about their tanks, but surely their aiplanes are the best at the moment with two bombs, beside the infantry having the best gun which is PPSz. Russians also have the best all rounded gun in the game, which is PTRD. It kills infantry with one shot, it destroyes light vehicles with one shot, and is capable of destroying pretty much all of the low tier armored vehicles in couple shots. It is also possible to shot down aircrafts with it. At the end, I need to add, that the Russian infantry have the best default camouflage, which makes them hard to see, everywhere.\n\n/Edit.\n\nHeroes & Generals is run by communists. They spread propaganda, lies, delete posts, topics, ban people that have different opinion. They glorify the Communists, and Sickle with Hammer.\n\nFrom the forum topic.\n\n"The Hammer and Sickle is there to stay, where as we won't implement Axis symbols such as the swastika in the game.\n\nThere are tons of countries and organizations all over the world that sadly committed atrocious crimes against humanity. The Axis's have a very large negative reputation in this aspect, represented by their flag, a 'face' and their concentration camps. In this game, the German faction is the Wehrmacht and not f.e. the SS.\n\nThe hammer and sickle also represents some of the above mentioned, but the symbolic value is way less concise and known. It goes beyond war crimes and is more arbitrary.\n\nThe topic will remain locked, as this is just an open flame war.\n\n~Circinus"\n\nI do not recommend.","July 12, 2014","false","348.5"," 96 of 145 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","96","145","0","5"

Not only that, but it also has very unrealistic damage which makes it really hard to kill since the game isnt all too smooth. It takes at LEAST 3 shots with the gewehr (starting german rifle) to kill someone, and over 8 shots with the first unlockable submachine gun.

I used to find this game very enjoyable and even got some of my friends to try it out. Old patches seemed to move the game forward by removing some bugs. Now  the Timoskenko update is out and has tons of issues. From balance to poor optimization of the general game. Poor servers with a ton of down time in the past two weeks. I dont consider this game pay to win but it would seem the developers dont care much about making general improvments. They would rather make "more" content to get more money from the people who actually buy stuff with money. I really hope they get there act together because this used to be a fun game. Honestly they really should be focused on making a enjoyable experience for the player then creating buggy and unbalanced mess of a patch that is Timoskenko.","March 30, 2015","false","521.4"," 95 of 145 people (66%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","66","95","145","8","0"

On the other Hand i can and will not recommend this Game to anybody else.\n\nHere are some Points why i can't recommend the Game:\n\n1. Sniper Rifle is usable as Infantry, as American you can get a 2.2x T-Post Scope on it, Germans got the 4x Scope and Russian got a 3.5 Scope. As Recons you can get a 8x Scope - but with a 4x Scope you won't spend Credits to become a Recon who has less Spawmpoints in the most Rounds (Just have a look at the War-Mode. Most Games have over 500 Inf. Spawms and then 24 Sniper Spawms, cool huh?)\n\n2. You can mod the Bolt Action Rifles to be a One-Hit-Killers (OHK) - and to prevent beeing oneshooted you need the Heavyset-Perk. Every Soldier only has 1-Perk Slot and only Premium-Members can equipt 2 Perks. In my Eyes this is a Pay2Win-Mechanism. Not a Premium-Member? Okay, get the Heavyset but dont get any other Perks like...Spraying less with a Rifle? Better Hipfire? Nooo - become a Premium Member to enjoy this. Otherwise you spawm - move 100 meters - get one shooted - repeat. Also as a Recon you want to have this No-Kill-Cam mod or you gonna move after some Kills since they are coming to hunt you down.\n\n3. You can Unlock- and buy everything with Money e.g. the No-Kill-Cam Perk. To Level-Up this Perk you need a lot of Time or just spend 30 Euros and buy it.\n\n4. Overall the Balance of the Game (Tanks, Planes, Weapons) is broken. I can not find any other Word for this, it's just a Fact e.g. the American APC is large as hell and the Driver can easily be killed since everything around him is opened and you just need to Spray a bit with an LMG - the German APC is smaller and the Driver is well protected.\n\n5. Forum-Posts with a bit of criticism get nearly Instant-Deleted. (No, no, no, no, no - our Game is fine! Everything is good - see our Forums! There are mostly positiv Posts! Yes, Funcom .. uhm Reto, it is! [innuendo to Funcoms Age of Conan Forums])\n\n6. A Lot of Vets aboned this Game. They moved on since there are other Games in a WW-Setting which are "better" then H&G e.g. Verdun (Yes, i know - this is WW1 Setting, not WW2 but let's wait for Battalion 1944 or play ARMA + WW2 Mods until then)\n\n7. The Russian Anti-Tank Rifle is a bit Overpowered. And yes, only Russia has such Weapon, as a American or German you need to live with the Bazooka/Panzerschreck but this kind of Weapons are hard to shoot at 100m+. The Russian Anti-Tank Rifle is like a Bolt-Action-Rifle. Spot the Target - Aim - press the Mousebutton and APC's, Jeep's, Bike's are down, also works very well on Light-Tanks and some Med-Tanks. You want to do this on 300meters or 400meters? No Problem! Oh and by the way... it also works  very very very well vs. PLANES! Want to kill the annoying Plane above you? Spot the Target - Aim - press Mousebutton and see the Plane falling down, yay!\n\n8. Cheaters and Hackers. Yeah, i know.. you have such People in every Game and mostly in FPS-Games. But since the H&G-Anti-Cheat doesn't seems to work... who cares? Also SweetFX is a Banning-Reason, so why doesn't the AntiCheat event detect SweetFX? You want to use SweetFX? No Problem - just don't tell anybody you do and you will be fine. Also Soldiers are better to Spot while using SweetFX since you won't have this annoying Gray-Veil.\n\n9. Patches and Hot-Fixes. Yes, everybody like them. They can really be a good thing, but mostly you won't find any Patch- or Hot-Fix Notes. Just live with the fact that they changed something without feeling the need to tell the Community what they did. It also seems a bit of uncoordinated, open the Game ... can not Login and the announcement is done 30-45mins. later in the Forum. Uhm, yes... that's not logical. Why not announce the Downtimes BEFORE you put the Servers down?\n\n10. Always the same Maps. To give you a Number: 5\n\n\nIf you are not quenched yet then feel free to try the Game but better play as a Russian Soldier. Don't promote your Soldier to a Recon (unless you really want to drive around with the Scout-Car or want Scout-AT's for the War-Mode) and please, do not spend any Money. Before you think about spending Money have a look at some other WW-Games (Verdun, Battalion 1944, ARMA + Mods etc etc)\n\n","April 6","false","380.5"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","44","59","6","1"

LOOK AT THIS REVIEW AS A STARTER PLAYER'S LOOK AT THE GAME\n\n\nPros: The game is awesome,tanks,infantry,plane and everything you can ever want!!!\n\nCons: 1.Why am i getting matched with 7+levels when im level 0...\n2.Did i just get 1 hitted by a sub-machine gun?\n3.Pay2win/pay2progress mechanics make the game even worse.\n4.Atleast the graphics are allright.BUT if you have a beast computer considering the minimals recommendations umm yeah they are completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and your game wont even TRY to run at 60 fps even if your computer is above recommended.\n5.LAG,LAG AND MORE LAG! If you're not in the European union,or america,dont bother downloading this game. Wait untill it's full release where there are more than 1 server.\n\n\n\nMy perspective of the game is basically this-\n\nYou start off as level 0. It forces you to get in a match when you start your game for the first time. You end up in a lobby with usually level 5+ players and even sometimes 7+. You get wrecked around them,you attack them with a bike,they attack you with a god damn armed car. Thank god you can shoot them pretty easily. It forces you to buy a sub-machine gun after you complete your first match.There are bugs,glitches but not that many,most of the time they wont bother you. I gave this game a chance or two, and i am still giving it a chance to redeem itself from the ''PAY2WIN/PAY2PROGRESS''  thing. People just buy a soviet tank and LITERALLY OBLIRIATE EVERYONE in a matter of seconds. Also,good luck getting trough a level with 1million xp while you get literally 5 xp for killing someone.\n\n\nI would give this a nice 4/10 in the face because of the matchmaking system being ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the entire ''Veteran to increase gains and xp'' thing to the even buying gold thing,to the deepest part of grinding to 1 level to another. These are pretty easy things to fix but the developers dont give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about their fans/players. I saw 1 guy at the forums asking people ''What should we add at the next update?''.\n\nAlso,this bike thing, like what the actual ♥♥♥♥,ok i know the technology wasn't that great but bikes? Aren't they suppoesed to get to the smallest conflicts atleast by an armed car or just walk the way?\n\n\nJUST WAIT UNTILL THE FULL GAME, IF THEY LISTEN TO THE PLAYERS THIS GAME WILL BE FANTASTIC.\n\nEDIT: I just got in 3 more conflicts, when i joined our team had no tanks whatsoever and the other entire team was attacking us with armored vehicles and 2 tiger tanks+ heavy armour destroyer (tank). The game is not balanced and i just dont know if it can be fixable when it got to this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t point.","February 21, 2015","false","17.3"," 101 of 156 people (65%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","65","101","156","13","21"

The only reason I actually stuck around was because I gave in and got a veteran membership (more xp and gold every round). With it I finally got to enjoy what else the game had to offer.

Its free to play, but when you continue to get spawncamped by a superior force complete with tanks, planes and snipers you will then realize its pay to win.\n\nEDIT: By no means is this system "unplayable."

However I can only beleive that so much espically when you shoot point blank range and AIM down sight with your smg and fire 15-30 rounds yet only about 7 actually detect that not lag that bad hit boxes.\n4. Hit boxes again when you hit someone they magically take no damage\n5.leveling up to get gear/ unit since last build is a joke I mean it will take something like 1 million xp to get from 12-13 with an average of 3k if your a good player per match will take you months and thats not even last level\n6. Maps can be one sided depending on what lanes are open\n7. anti tanks mines are just stupid on how they are used you sneak up behinde a tank plant a mine run away and shoot it(assuming you actually got up that close without getting shot at)\n8. Lack of anti air planes can domiate maps at times because inf don't have anything to take planes out expect AA guns which do very little damage.\n\nNow there are good things as well but till they sort out the major issues in the game i say avoid Espically the hit boxes one the rest if you play smart you can get around it.

My personal opinion is DO NOT DO IT, don't bother installing the game.  It is sad for me to write as it has been a game that while has some flaws, was mostly enjoyable.\n\nThe developers just released a update that in effect nerfed most weapon/perk progression by 50-75%, and in a response to the outcry on the forum about the change  they stated along the lines of they felt progression was too fast since internally they think maxing out a ribbon (their term for weapon/skill progress) should take 200 hours.\n\nThe end result is it harms veteran players that have multiple character and trying still level those, though the most damaging result will be on those new players coming into the game, and facing players that leveled under the old system.\n\nBecause I remember the frustration of just starting out and fairly soon leveled enough to be put into tier 2,(with all veteran players) it was insanely annoying getting one shotted by vets with sniper rifles or bolt action rifles.  That or being blown to hell by a tank halfway across the map.  But the silver lining was that it didn't take very long to build enough xp to get to be moderately competitive with those running fully upgraded builds.  Would say it took me maybe 20-30 hours of game play for me to do.  But with the new update the leveling process will take 2-3 times longer for most ribbons.\n\nThese changes along with the new morale system for the rts part has turn the game from a bit of a grind though acceptable into something that reminds me of those Korean grindfest MMO's than are almost a requirement to pay money for in order to enjoy the game.\n\nIn summary DO NOT INSTAL, wait for them to correct this nerf.  But if you decide you still want to give the game a try makes sure to share your thoughts both on steam and the forums.  Just fair warning it is likely you will be the victim of seal clubbing by veteran players that can kill you from ranges you don't have a chance to match for quite some time.","June 4, 2015","false","926.1"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","29","36","2","0"

All the reviews on front are overwhelmingly negative.\n\nBoy, I guess I wish I would've started playing during those days! Leveling is an absolute joke in this game. You need CoD/ Battlefield levels of experience points to level up, but you don't even get 1/10th of that in battle. They put all the shiny weapons and goodies out of reach, tempting you to spend real money to buy them all. If there was ever an obvious pay to win game, it's this one. It's hardly even fair for those that just want to play the game, getting one-shotted by the people who've either ground their lives to smithereens or spent boatloads of cash buying the bolt-actions and sniper rifles, then upgrading them so they kill you instantly. Then you decide to upgrade your weapons and realize maintenance is a pain in the rear (again encouraging you to spend real money).\n\nI guess the game could be fun and I'd be willing to put the hours I did into MW2 into here if the game was actually fun. For some reason, optimization is beyond poor, even though it was originally just a browser game (i.e. should run smoothly). I can forgive the Battlefield 1942 graphics (even though that game looks better and doesn't use DX11), but the game and browser screens themselves are absolute memory hogs. 4GB recommended? Yeah, right - you're gonna need at least double that if you have ANYTHING running in the background. Playing this and talking to friends over Skype is a nightmare. Unigine Heaven on maximum settings runs smoother than this game at times.\n\nGameplay also has major issues. Since you're stuck with a faction, balancing is a nightmare. Sometimes your team will be outnumbered 2:1 in players just because so many people have left and no one has joined in. Match length is another major issue - skirmishes don't last long enough for you to do more than a few captures (if you're lucky and don't die), while some assault levels will quite literally drag on forever as the game waits for one of the three (yes, three-way battles) factions to take all the points. This proves pretty much impossible, and it turns into a game of which side loses all their lives first (which doesn't work as well as it did in Battlefield's Conquest mode). I don't usually go AFK, but when I do, it's because matches drag on for hours in this game. Don't even get me started on combat - so many issues with that as well (again, go play a few other well-established and refined WWII FPS's to see my point). I understand this is in early access beta, but the game is so fundamentally flawed I don't even know where to begin (probably relates back to the pay to win model the developers use).\n\nThe only reason I'd recommend playing is if you want a free game for you and your friends to mess around in (as I do).","June 22, 2015","false","116.1"," 43 of 61 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","43","61","0","1"

And it has gotten better since I had last played about 6 months ago. But only marginally. This had made me want to change my negative review to positive - that's how good it had gotten. I had just unlocked the Sherman (Worst thing about it - HE and APCR [APCR is a NECESSITY. You can not play tanks without it.] took a while to unlock) and was having a bit of fun with it. As I was writing a positive review, I decided I should see how it is with a new character. So I decided to pull a raw recruit for Germany, and I'll say how fun THAT was...\n\nSo I started off doing the tutorial for the quick level and First Blood badge (As I had done when I was actually first starting off). I then hopped into a match and it was decent. Nothing amazing. The next match wasn't so good. The third match was abhorrent. I came up against PPShs, PPSs, and PPDs with nothing more than a stock Gewher 43. I was mowed down in seconds flat in close range, and in medium or long range I couldn't hit anything (Mostly due to not having the ability to hold my breath). I had just gotten grenades, so that was alright, but my Gewher could do nothing to combat the automatic SMGs, Rifles, and Machine Guns that almost every enemy had. And thus, I decided to change my review to negative.\n\nSo here are some pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n\n- Looks decent, not amazing, but decent\n- Very active player base\n\nCons:\n\n- Everything is expensive\n- You don't make much money, next to nothing when starting off\n- Garbage starting gear -> Can't compete with anyone else\n- Long grind between level to level\n- Spawn camping is still a thing, despite devs trying to get rid of it\n- Spawn protection exploits\n- Airplanes can damage tanks with AP MGs, strafe with HE MGs, and wreck everything with bombs. All on the same plane.\n- Infantry have a meriad of ways to destroy tanks\n- Back cappers are ♥♥♥♥♥\n- Para\n- Excessive pandering towards long-time veteran players who basically already have everything\n- Grind is essentially the pay wall. Pay up now, or face the grind!\n\nYes, I mostly pull tanks.","April 10","false","230.5"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","36","49","0","8"

And the money as well you have to grind to get it another 10-30 hours. Oh did i mentioned that you have to hit tier 2 to get in the big maps. You have to play those small maps over and over again to get tier 2 one of your soldiers, it takes 15-40 hours (without premium.) And when you hit the tier 2 one of you soldiers get ready for veterans players who have unlocked everything. Yuo have your first gun semi-auto(garand,g43 or svt-40) or perhaps the first sub machinegun.

It reminds me Battlefield 1942 + The original Call of Duty + Medal of Honor allied Assault.\n\nIts an awesome World War 2 experience Mixing all Aspects of the War. You have Fighter Planes, Tanks, Paratroopers, Snipers, Infantry, Gaurds, All kinds of weapon combinations and possibilities. You have freedom to do what you want and the open world Combat is great. The Game also Incorporates an RTS aspect were you can help control the outcome of the War by sending units you command into battles.\n\nThe Developers are really active with the Community. The Overall Community of the game is amazing, Probably the nicest community I have ever seen in a game. The Reddit, Forums, and Livestreamers alike are great places to talk to people.\n\nSome people have come to steam to write bad reviews because maybe the latest update made them mad, or they didn't get to unlock recon in 1 day.  These people have missed the point. Your not supposed to unlock a new weapon every round like its call of duty.. The game is still in Beta and takes alot of Heat for that, but I have watched the game evolve over the years and Each Update it just keeps getting better.

From the very beginning developers wanted H&G to be more like a real war. This game is not about fair battles, mirrored teams and kill to death ratio. It’s about taking what you get and using it to the best of your abilities. And if you want to influence battles even more you can become a general.\n\nMore often than not the game is unfair but it can be fun in it’s own way. It’s most certainly not for everyone though.\n\nThe way they made it is a far cry from how wars are fought you don’t give your soldiers inadequate gear and weapons then send them off to the slaughter and expect them to win you give them equipment that is better suited for the situation and is capable of standing some sort of a stance.\n\n“Sir the enemy has a squad of tanks what should we do?”\n\n“Well we have a ton a bikes… use those.”\n\n“B-but sir!”\n\n“Did I stutter? saddle up and peddle on out there son!”\n\nThe tanks vs bikes battles come to be because of the differences in sources that each faction has. From my understanding, the unbalance is partially caused by the people playing on the Axis side have had way more warfunds to buy resources with than the people in the Allied side. This causes the unbalance in battles and the one-sided wars that have occurred for some time now. Additionally, since the Axis side ends up wining more often, players switch factions and thus more players end up joining the Axis which doesn’t help much with the balance.\n\nIf you are on the Allied side, the above reason is the likely cause of the bikes vs tanks battles. Additionally, if you want to avoid these sort of battles when playing on either faction, when you click on “enter combat”, select “find mission” and when you click on a battle, you can view the resources available at that time. Choosing “random mission” matches you in a battle without taking resources into account.","August 16, 2014","true","746.3"," 48 of 70 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","48","70","3","12"

But the extreme lack of balance and pay to win nature of it ruin the expirience. People can do all sorts of things to instantly by pass leveling up by buying soldiers and weapons with gold. Honestly you can't blame them for doing that. The amount of expirience you need to rank up to diffrent branches like tank driver or fighter pilot are insane. And the amount of expirience you need to unlock weapons with rediculous amoutns of money is often even higher. You can modify weapons to the point of having the standard rifle being a one hit kill no matter where you hit, and the game is over all just a cesspool of hacks and Pay to win players. The balance is the real issue here. I've entered matches before that are one team with only infantry vs. a team that is completely made up of fighter pilots. The fighters and tanks dominate the battle feild. one tank on the enemy side could mean the complete destruction of your team. Because the tanks have almost no bullet fall. So its a fun game over all once you grind for 5 days strait to unlock weapons that give you the slightest chance of victory. But I would not recommend this game to anyone that isn't willing to put money into it. But those people who don't even TRY to level up legitmattly I hate, because you really ruin the game for others.But to those of you who have grinded, and grinded and GRINDED SOME MORE, I respect that. Because despite how bad this game is, you found enjoyment and sunk all the time into it. The thing is though games like H and G aren't worth sinking you money into at all! Games like this update like say every couple of months maybe even years? while games like unturned that make almost no money at all pump out updates almost every day on the dot. So since its free, maybe play it, MAYBE.

Not time to go on a spree of adding a bunch of content that no one asked for. Fix your game before you start adding things you want.\n\nThis game has the potential to be one of the best WW2 FPS out there. The concept is there the physics are there (kind of) and the content is there, but all that potential is squandered by an absurdly lengthy grind and over priced items (greedy devs?).\n\nThis game is also unbalanced, but i did not include it above because i feel that is what can make it fun at times. You never know what you're going to be up against and you have to adapt to the situation, that's the element of realism. It's a strange ideology but that's what i feel.\n\nHow to improve the game:\n\n1: Having a grind in a game is good, it what keeps people playing, but having too much of one is a bad thing because it will make people leave. So just make items a little less expensive and easier to unlock.\n\n2: Improve the servers and performance of the game. this is not to prevalent of an issue but it's there and fixing this may entice people with lower end PCs to play your game (ie: warthunder).\n\n3: Have more graphic options. This is more of a personal thing but we only have like three thing to change when it comes to visuals.\n\n3: Take a break from adding content and fix the content you added. There are certain weapons/tanks/planes/cars that don't quite look/preform/feel right.\n\n4: Fix the ugly and unresponsive menus. I know this is not just me because other people are complaining about it too. Just make it look better.\n\n5: Pay attention to your player base. A Lot of companies are falling short of this recently and not listening to their community. This is how companies go bankrupt and lose all their fans.\n\nAnd that's all she wrote. I have nothing else to say, i want to love this game, it has very thing i wanted from a game, the execution of those ideas was what ruined this game.\n\nBUT! over all this is still in beta and i will keep hope on this game until it is complete (even though it's been about 2 years).","April 23","false","122.7"," 39 of 55 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","39","55","0","2"

It's totally a skill based matchup where you can go out and have a lot of fun. Once you (or any single one of your friends) hits level 5, the party is officially over. You immediately get thrown into much larger conflict against people who have a ton of weapons upgrades/vehicles that you don't have access to, and grinding levels becomes terrifying.\n\nThe gold purchasing in this game enables wallet warriors to reign supreme, and completely disenfranchizes those who don't have/want hundreds of dollars to go into a single game.

To be honest, I can't even remember going in. All I can remember is my character waking up on the second floor of an abandoned house just outside the town where I lived and that I was wearing some soldier's clothes. The name of the soldier was Karl Muller. I know this because I could read the name tag on the jacket. All this seemed very weird to me, but I decided to just go back home and figure out everything there. I needed to get out of those clothes; I didn’t want to be confused with someone else.\n\nJust as I was walking down, I heard someone's whistle and an engine running outside the house. When I stepped outside, I saw a man wearing some weird looking green uniform running towards a funny looking green small vehicle and leaving. I decided to steal a bicycle that was sitting right in front of the house and went for a ride through the fields. I figured it was the shortest way home. As I was making my way along the river, I heard a loud noise in the woods and then a clicking noise (metal on metal) right afterwards. I got off the bike and took protection behind a tall tree and all I remember is that I was very scared. I took a minute to look around and see where that noise was coming from. Then, I saw it. It was that man wearing the green uniform. He was lying on the floor, had a really long rifle and he was looking down to a wooden barn across the field. It was a long way, but I saw some men running in and out of that barn. They were wearing a dark grey uniform (much like the one I was wearing) and looked desperate. It was almost as if they were running for their lives. Then the man shot another bullet with his rifle. It was so loud that I had to cover my ears. Then I looked towards the barn and saw one of those soldiers lying on the floor, motionless. The other soldiers were nowhere to be found and I remember feeling sorry for that guy. I asked myself- Why did this happened? Why? That sadness I felt for the guy quickly turned into anger, but to myself. I felt rage and resentment to my cowardly actions. This anger took control over myself and made me grab a shovel I had in my procession (don't know where it came from) and smashed it into that man's head. There was nothing he could do. I think it took one or two hits, but by the time I was done he was no longer part of this world. I grabbed his rifle and saw a complete different world through that scope. I saw tanks and loud fighter airplanes. I saw men in dark gray and green uniforms running everywhere. I saw them fighting over abandoned houses, bridges, and other sectors. I saw dead bodies flying several hundred meters up in the air. I saw a man on a motor bike running over three young soldiers and then exploding after hitting a tree. I saw smoke and heard loud explosions. All the things I saw, I saw them through the scope of this rifle. A rifle I DIDN'T pay for. Then I quickly realized that I was a real soldier and that I was sent to this Free to Play war to see all this epic things and to recommend this game to you.\n\nThere is a Free to Play soldier in all of us.\n\n10/10 -Would steal your scopes, cars, bikes, and tanks from you again.","December 3, 2014","true","89.4"," 88 of 141 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","88","141","0","5"

You can not enter a fight without a squad. You either call your friends or the game will add you into a random squad. People on the random squad are usually does not even care if you're on the same squad or not. And the real problem begins there. Only Squad members can be on a seat that is different than a passenger of your vehicle. For example i just bought an AA(Anti-Air) Vehicle. But because of this update, anyone that is not on my squad can not be my gunner. There is no button or option to switch your vehicle from Squad only to public. So since my squad members does not care if im their squad, they hop on to another vehicle and leave your vehicles gun unmanned. There are ofcourse others that are not in my squad trying to be my gunner by pressing every button in their keyboard/mouse but its not working since there is no such button. So yeah everything was fine until this last update. Everyone had a place in the war.  Lone-wolders could go and lone wolf, Vehicle crew members could have enter to a vehicle and be one. This squad system ofcourse has its advatages: you and your team mates can gain exp a lot faster this way. But i really do think that they HAVE TO add a button or an option to switch your vehicles gunner/commander etc. seats to public from squad only.

(this is a pre-Walker, July 2015, build review, I edit when I notice considerable changes from what I pointed out below)\n\nA game set in WW2 that appears to be as a dynamic, gamebalance-first, capture the point mission, fast-paced Arcade game, with sufficient historic assemblage (>Heroes). On top, there is real time strategy part, where you move your troops on the map and then zoom into the FPS battles (> Generals).\nSounds nice so far, that's why it attracted me in the first place.\n\nThere is a bit of overdramatizing following, but more than just the essence is true:\n\nBut the developer, despite claiming otherwise, extremly favors 1 hit kill Infantry camping play style, making the game a spawncamp game. No matter if you have a non-sniper class, just grab the >sniper< Bolt Action rifle and camp, preferably at the opponent spawnpoints.\n\nThe developer appears helpless of his own creation, finds no other way to balance his game towards his aim to have defenders win about 60% of the matches, resulting in frustrating gameplay.\nEnemies kill you at sight (although there is an Arcade lifepoint system) and your own men prefer to sit in the woods as well, believe they are heavenly snipers and don't care about defending the cap points, taking or retaking them; mission objectives are failed. Not so dynamic... It's not the players' fault, they just accept what the designer offers.\n\nTo play it on some decent level at least you need to grind and the grind/farm factor for key items is ... well, let's say you have to spend a lot of money (€, $, etc.) instead.\n\nThe strategy part is out of balance due to the issue of an underpopulated faction, making the whole Generals part for the most populated faction a pain in the ***: German troops can easily stay 1-2 days (!) in the waiting queue while Soviet faction immediately deploys...","June 4, 2015","false","090.5"," 27 of 35 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","27","35","0","0"

It certainly strikes me as pay to win, it takes hours grinding up even individual mods, and to top it off, they depreceate and must be repaired, or special ammo types must be replenished.  It's a game that has too many rewards for paid players, and as someone who really has no problem spending money on games, the fact that it was trying to force me to do it so much turned me off pretty quickly.\n\nThere also seems to be a lack of guns, and moreso because beyond 2 guns you can get initially (the semi-automatic rifle or the smg) the rest are trapped behind paywalls or level-ups that will take days if not weeks to obtain.  Not enough choice beyond having a hamburger or a cheeseburger.\n\nFinally, the matchmaking is very poor, and that's why I can't recommend the game.  Several times tonight I was put on teams with people rank 1-3 against people ranked 7+.  They clearly outgunned the teams, had access to things like tanks (when no one on my team even had access to anti-tank weapons), and could just camp objectives with tanks and we ended up losing very quickly.  When I first came to the game, the Nazi's lost 9 games in a row, even when I played as Nazi's and had k/d ratios of 5:1 (and pushing objectives).  The game isn't well balanced.\n\nAs far as positives, the combat itself is great.  A minimal HUD lends well to the long distance combat.  Shooting is difficult and takes patience, skill, and a steady hand.  The maps are well done and many times I had a great time fighting big battles over objectives, with a constant back and forth attack/defend going on in the domination style skirmish mode.  Even though you only get two weapons by default, both of them perform really well at their role, and seem well balanced.\n\nAll in all, this looked like such a great addition to the WW2 FPS style genre, but it really falls flat with balancing issues in matchmaker and pay to win access to skills and weapons.  As much as I want to love it, it still needs work.","February 2, 2015","false","14.8"," 61 of 95 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","61","95","2","1"

At first, it is a very unique and exiciting shooter, having everyone roll out into an objective with a jeep, is pretty cool. After a couple of games, this starts to become repetitive and a bit tedious. The charge across road, hide in forest, capture objective, is a fairly solid idea however it quickly bores, in my opinion. Even when this is fun, which is 50% of the time, when you have an epic firefight across the forests and storm objectives, it does feel a bit tedious at times, you die drive another jeep in die, again and again and again. Despite this, it is great fun when everything in the game comes together, the tank crews rolling in, parachuters dropping down and airplanes bombing you this way and that. When all of these things occur at the same time it is great, and this happens quite often. However, there are a variety of factors that drag this down, not just because of game mechanics, but perhaps also because of the community and players. It gets annoying when you charge into an objective, get sniped, do it again, get sniped, do it again, get sniped and so on. Plenty of people are going to say, "That's your own fault for being stupid HERDURR," the problem is,  there's not much else I can do as an infantry man. I can sit back and try and snipe people? But this isn't really a factor in this game. There's not much you can do but charge, machine gun and die, the marksman factor of this game exsists but it's not very effective, and there's no other gameplay mechanics that change this. An example I can use is Planetside 2 or Arma, where it is a perfectly reasonable option to just surround the objective and starve out your enemies, something that doesn't happen in this game. That might just be the way I feel about this game, but it is my review. Finally, in my big rant, there are times when I just want to smash my pc to pieces. There is nothing more annoying than a tank destroyer creeping around into the rear and blowing up every tank that spawns because the turrets are too slow to turn, and no one can blow up the enemy tank because anti tank items are too 'pay to win' and most people don't seem to even know about them.\n\nThe game has got a very large and annoying pay to win system, don't get me wrong it's a great game, graphics are great, gameplay is great, but pay to win and annoying tactics and repetition lets this game down, so overall I'd give it a 7.5/10. This is just what I've seen from the game, people may disagree but that's what I think.","October 5, 2014","true","32.8"," 41 of 60 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","41","60","0","2"

This game can be broken up into two seperate games; the Hero aspect or the General aspect; I've only played the Hero aspect because the General is a serious grind and I started multiple characters I'll explain why in a bit.\n\nEach character has its own set of XP and when appropriate levels are reached can be branched off into Armour (tanks), Fighters (aircraft), Paratroopers, Recon (snipers). One important thing to note is that when you branch off of infantry you cannot use that character as an infantry unit without switching branches (which costs credits), Credits are earned by your soldier pay (XP based) and your battle performance.\n\nFrom the guys that I game with (important to get in a group if you want to be effective) there was a recent overhaul on the game that favoured the American side of things, don't expect this game to be historically accurate with weapons as there has to be some semblance of balance, and in this reviewers opinion it is near overwhelmingly one sided.\n\nOverall as a free to play game I feel it is one of the best I've found, like all communities there are those who are helpful and those who are not. The tutorial is ♥♥♥♥♥ but that's why there are staged battles (that pay out just as well if not more then actual battles) I'll update the review as I play.","January 12, 2015","true","003.9"," 91 of 148 people (61%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","61","91","148","40","3"

Well I'm not looking for that, as there are kiddies present, but what I am looking for is some damage effect. Since when can a person get wounded by three or four bullets and still run, move and aim like a champion?\n\nHUD:\nSo you've stealthfully walked, run, swam and crawled your way across half the map to capture a point and when you do a big circle appears over your head and tells every player on the map where you are. Almost as incoherent are the 'enemy spotted' tags which appear over your head if you ever dare fire your weapon. No matter how cleverly hidden you are, every enemy soldier on the map will see a nice red arrow pointing at you if you do. The only solution is to emulate the snipers who camp on top of a hill at the back of the action if you want to rack up the kills.\n\nTanks:\nThe tanks are seriously over powered which ruins it for anyone in the infantry. This could so easily be balanced with early access to anti-tank grenades.\n\nLinear Warfare:\nThe main disappointment for me is the linear battles where you must take point A before point B before point C etc. This makes it far too easy for the enemy to park a tank at point B or just pound it endlessly with shells knowing that if we fail to take that one undefendable barn then the whole battle is over.\n\nConclusion:\nWhat could well have been a great open world game is now a counter strike clone with tanks that take no damage from rocket launchers. Spawn, get sniped, spawn, get tanked, spawn and get shot by the guy hiding in the loft where you spawned. I almost gave in and was going to spend some money to buy a shovel but thought better of it. Play it for a while until the battle fatigue and shell shock sets in, even throw the devs a dollar or two, then go do something constructive.","February 13, 2015","false","22.3"," 97 of 159 people (61%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","61","97","159","14","9"

From the "realistic" gameplay, the completely "balanced" factions, or maybe the "realtime" wars that players influence, I would have to say that it doesn't really live up to anything that it says!\n\nLets start with the free to play part! It, as stated above, can take upto weeks just to get enough money and XP to buy a weapon. However! If you think that you're above this, and don't want to wait, you can just spend the ~10 US dollars to buy it right there and then. (Buying it with credits even allows you to COMPLETELY skip over the XP requirements, along with the money!)\n\nThen comes the "realistic" and "Simulation" battles- IF one could call them that! I believe that the biggest contender here is the movement model, which although had some nice hopes... is for lack of better words, sh*t. Many a times I have been in open fields or with large arm movement areas, when I get into a firefight with another soldier. Mid shooting, my gun pulls up and does the action that it does when your muzzle isn't in position (Because APPARENTLY my gun was running into some invisible force?) for firing. Then theres the maps... Oh! how I hate ALL of the maps. From large open areas with almost no cover from base to base, to the maps where it looks as though you must camp in order to be successful, or maybe the maps with overgrown areas with large amounts of fog? All in all, the maps aren't that great either, simply compounding upon everything else that is wrong in this game.\n\nAfter that, there goes the "balance" which just as everything before is little but existent. I'd like to paint a little picture for you here...\nAmerican Bombing Planes: 2 bombs\nGerman Bombing Planes: 1 bomb\nSoviet Bombing Planes: 4 bombs! (Kinda crazy right?)\nBut, the German plane must have SOME redeeming qualities right? Like better mobility, or stronger bullets? Nope, its the exact same as the other, if not worse. After the planes comes the tanks and weapons. (I'd like to just say real quick, Germany is EASILY the most underpowered, and it seems that the developers neither intend to make it better, or debuff the other factions as they just recently added the Soviets into the game, which look to have the best weapons.) From the poor guns of the German, to the crazy one shot rifles and ludacris fire rate and accuracy of the American weapons, to the overly good starting Soviet guns, its blatantly obvious that the developers favor some faction WELL over others. Tanks/vehicles, while pretty well balanced, are VERY overpriced, and some seem to have the sole function of spinning in circles or denying friction. All in all, the game's balance seems to be lacking, and its actually rather annoying to see the devs. favor some factions over others...\n\nThose "real-time" wars you were expecting? Or that "huge scale" battles that you thought you were going to get? Wrong again! While yes, there is a mega server that most of the battles take place on, and are ranked, most battles are only 16 V 16. This looks to be a rather small amount of people for all of the "class variety" that the game has, leading to searching for game up to 10 minutes (And thats without a squad... being in a squad can take AGES). Finally, after getting into a game, you may notice that THE WHOLE SERVER consist of just THAT class, or very few other... You can see that this leads to frustrating gameplay, and overly long searching time for a game that it may 'plop' you in, which ends roughly a minute after your joining! (Also, I'm not really going to approach the whole, campaign thing, as its seems to literally be pointless. Wars end within a day and most of the time it doesn't give props to the right faction... but you can almost always bet the Germans lose, even when they win?)\n\nAll in all, this game really in a trainwreck, that yes, I have had SOME fun playing, needs A LOT (and I cant stress enough how much I mean that) of work. Also, before you say, "Oh well you've spent almost 100 hours playing the game, it MUST be good!" I would like to state that I have only spent that much time in game because I wanted to be able to expierence a large portion of it so that I may give a proper rating and suggestions!","March 11, 2015","false","161.7"," 85 of 138 people (62%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","62","85","138","13","2"

It can be different everytime but there will always be infantry :P. Sometimes there may be medium tanks with planes or there can be light tanks with paratroopers etc. You can play as any of the 3 factions any time you want but each soldier has it's own equipment and level so choose wisely.\n\nWAR\nAfter a soldier reaches rank 12 or is a general, they can buy assault teams that affect the war and how it plays out. While you can do this, you are stuck with the faction you choose until the war is over and then you can swap. Playing war allows people to level up faster both by their actual level and their ribbons. In exchange for this bonus xp, the matches are much more... unpredictable. What resources you have will be dictated by the general's ATs that are fighting in that area. If you lose the battle, that area will be taken over by the other faction. If you win, you'll keep/takeover that area. Each battle is just part of a larger battlefield all across Europe with over 3000 different locations to fight for or to defend. The war ends when 15 major cities are taken over by a single faction.\n\nHOW YOU WILL START\nMost people with start with the FPS side (unless you buy a level 12+ soldier or a general). You will start playing encounter first with other new people which is a small, infantry only map. It only has one objective so it can be a tad bit hectic but it's only to help you get used to the game and they normally last about 5-10 minutes. Once you reach level 1, then you can start playing the smaller attack/defend maps. You will start to see the other types of classes in play now (recons, paratroopers and tanks (becareful of these buggers :P)). Once you reach level 5, you will be allowed to play the larger A/D maps and you will be introduced to planes (also avoid these buggers xD). You will also beable to play war batlles but I wouldn't advice it until you get better gear.\n\nGOODS:\n- Pay2NotGrind not Pay2Win (no one can really gain a definite advantage over you, skill will still reign supreme), I've seen people think they can win by paying money and see them do absolutely terrible with a MG42 xD I could kill them with a stock M1 Garand!\n- Variety of weapons used (STG, M1/M2, PTDR, AVS-36 etc.)\n- Different variety of maps (some are more CQC and others more open)\n- Infantry, Tanks, Planes, Paratroopers, Recons (oh my!)\n- Infantry Only Map! :D\n- EVERYTHING CAN BE BOUGHT WITH INGAME CREDITS! (this includes Veteran (premium) Membership!)\n- Anti tank weapons are found around the map so tanks can be destroyed even if you don't have AT nades or mines!\n- Higher rank of your soldier, the more money he earns\n- Modable weapons!\n- Since Adams update, they've added a way for infantry to deal with planes WITH MOBILITY! :D\n- The starter rifles have receieved a massive buff that puts them as one of the best weapons in the game currently if you use the right mods\n\nBADS:\n- Not very welcoming for new players (stuck on SA for a while...)\n- Tanks and planes can be a problem if you don't have the right equipment\n- Currently, Germany is the most populated faction with most of the vets, America is mostly full of the newbs, Soviets is least populated but I find it's an average player base\n- YE GODZ THE GRIND IS GREAT\n- Got to pay (either with ingame credits or gold) for the weapons you used (mods, ammo, the weapon itself...) but if you're smart, this cost shouldn't be much\n- The maps can get a bit repetitive after a while but the devs have stated they have maps in development\n\nConclusion:\n- It can be overwhelming at first but stay for the long run to have the best fun\n- It's like a "WW2 Battlefield"\n- It encourages playing the objective and not K/D like COD\n- You earn more money and xp for capping/defending the objective than just killing the enemy team\n- Don't listen to the negative reviews by people with only 6 hours into this game, they just call BS reasons why you shouldn't play\n- They mentions hackers but in all of my 600 + hours, I have yet to encounter a hacker\n- Be smart, don't be a jimmy (Kotton reference :P)\n\nNow to ready up my M1903 and M1 Garand and kill lots of people :3","November 4, 2015","true","907.5"," 141 of 237 people (59%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","59","141","237","15","40"

I stopped playing the game a few updates ago when the completely redid the ribbons and badges and I wasted so much time that I spent working towards badges because of the badges being moved to other ribbons and ribbons being added. I was really mad before that, when an update got rid of ALL my modifications for my weapons and vehicle modifications, they all cost so much more than before, AND the mods did little to nothing save for a couple on most weapons (which, after, cost relatively more). I came back to this game this week and they changed a lot of things that I don't really mind too much. I went from a hardline connection to wifi  (now, 53 up/49 down) and can't run the game on LOW SETTINGS without lag or low fps, which didn't use to be the case. I realize it's wifi, but shouldn't it still work with a connection I generally have no problems with? I play higher quality games on medium settings AND can watch a stream without problems. This game used to be so much better than it is now—and even the super grinding was somewhat tolerable before. A year ago, I would have given this game a recommendation based on how fun it is for a free fps.

The followthrough and direction it is going in are laughable.\n\nFor a game that's been in 'beta' now for YEARS, updates tend to give players new skins and small tweaks to maps like moving trees around. Over the coarse of the last year, only 1 new map has been released; this still puts this 4+ year BETA with less maps than BF1942 had as a free DEMO. Updates are roughly 2+ months apart and offer very little updating to content, depth, polish or gameplay but rather stupid broken mechanics or skins/camo.\n\nThe overall war mechanic is completely useless and boring. The combat is on the same 4-5 maps over and over and over and over. It doesn't matter if you're defending Berlin or fighting in some unnamed village - its the same map. Win the war? Who cares. A new one loads right after, everything goes back to as before, no bonuses or anything for winners/losers and its the same war with the same maps again and again and again.\n\nAt the rate this game is 'releasing' and the fact that the often incompetant development team is focused on adding in fluff and small mechanics to make this a P2W (or at least, pay to not grind endlessly) instead of actual content shows that the state this game is in currently will be what it looks like 1-2 years from now, with a few minor things added in/changed/patched/broken and then removed altogether again.\n\nI'm looking forward to the next 'update' because I may get a scope for my shovel, some camo for my bicycle seat, ammunition that isn't an upgrade to anything and having a house on the airfrield map painted a diffferent color.\n\nIn short, this development team is dild@s.","September 13, 2015","false","023.0"," 54 of 84 people (64%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","64","54","84","12","0"

Basically this means is it is impossible to progress through in the game without shelling out some real money. The issues with the game with new players still remain below.\n\nDon't play this game, it is very unfirendly to new players. The community is very toxic towards new players as well, the 'vets' claim it's skill is why 'noobs get owned'. But if you happen to pick up a dead vets weapon then it becomes apparent that skill has nothing to do with it. I picked up a dead vets light machine gun and it was more accurate than my infantry standard bolt action rifle at long range. Clearly my score increased dramtically whenever I had the opputunity to pick up an upgraded weapon, so 'skill' as the toxic vets say is just their way of inflating their e-♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nIt doesn't help that the game throws you in the sharks pit once you hit lv 3 (roughly 5 hours gameplay). After level 3 you can be matched with anyone, this puts you at a severe disadvantage and you are forced to try and grind (performance based leveling up) vs oponents that are much better equiped than you are. If the xp you gain was fixed rarther performance based (kills etc) I would feel the need to try and slog through it. But it feels like you're trying to push sh*t uphill rarther than play the game.","March 7, 2015","false","284.9"," 85 of 139 people (61%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","61","85","139","6","4"

There's MANY things that need to be added, updated, fixed, and nerfed but trust me, it is alot of fun.\nHere's a list of what needs to be fixed.\n\nPROS:\n-Lots of intense moments and BattleField like gameplay and strategy.\n-VEHICLES!!! Seriously BattleField is not the only one to do this.\n-Guns, and if that don't work, use more gun. Lots of guns though i only have 5 hours so i don't have them.\n-TeamKilling your friends and sending them the moon.... There is a report button if they do teamkill.\n-Big Teams for an all out Warfare in one little spot on the map.\n-FORESTS THAT PEOPLE ACTUALLY GO IN!! :D    I had a 1v1 with a Nazi in the forest, he threw 'nades at me and I just shot him 'till i ran out and got a headshot and started moving on only to get blown up by a 'nade he dropped....\n-Stealth??? I guess you could sneak up on the enemy by hiding in the bushes? My friend did.\n-PlanetSide 2 real time war thingy.  There's a war thing where you pick a faction just like PlanetSide 2 and well yeah...\n-Fences that may be torn apart with a magic item called A JEEP.\n-Sort of like a realtime FPS i guess. You have to repair and re-load your weapons between battles with either In-game $ or IRL $$$ if you're a P2W. Also Repair Vehicles.\n-Weight system!! I don't know how to describe it but it's amazing.\n-Many WW2 jokes with friends, we are horrible people.....\n-Day/Night cycle!!!\n\nCONS:  (WARNING) There is alot of cons but remember, THIS IS EARLY ACCESS IT WILL HAVE CONS!!!\n-Very high recoil with the Starting Rifles, just tone down the Recoil by like %10-%15 with Rifles\n-Low EXP per round making leveling up sort of difficult : /\n-No time limits to a game also when you join a battle you're stuck in it 'till it ends.. This *Jarate'd* me off last night -_-\n-You get a bunch of $$$ after a match but after repairing you got 1 quarter of it to spend :(\n-Because this game runs on a server i guess different from Steam, You have to add friends to invite them.\n-Sometimes the guns don't make any sound upon shooting so i got absoulutly destroyed last night by ninjas : /\n-You have to complete a challenge that takes a long time to get your first pistol and even then you need $$$ to get it\n-Ribbons basically unlock gameplay. Yes, you need to get ribbons to get new stuff\n-Jeeps that within 30 seconds of spawning turn into Party vans. (Too many people allowed on a jeep at once)\n-No spawning on capture points that you control and are clear of any hostiles. Have fun walking into getting teamkilled.\n-Slow crouch movement speed, it's almost as slow as prone but walking is like sprinting.\n-Few things that require Gold ($$$ that is bought with $$$ from your wallet)\n-The Gold Memberships are not permanent, like 1200 Gold=30 Day subscription just so you can get more EXP and more slots for weapons and equipment and such\n-The turrets on Vehicles are really wonky and wavy it's almost impossible to aim straight with it.\n\nSo last thoughts: Really fun game with high potential and I hope it is successful. I hope there are more game modes, more maps, more servers other than the one Julian server, Easier EXP and $$$, more options for new players (pistol), and please let me spawn on captured points that are clear!! I suggest this game to BattleField fans looking for a nice WW2 themed game or anyone looking for WW2 stuff.\n\n5,300,000/6,000,000","April 19, 2015","true","11.7"," 61 of 98 people (62%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","62","61","98","21","3"

It really only takes you a day or two of playing to get access to tanks and planes, but then you're up against other people that have been playing longer (or paid) and have vehicles that stomp you.  As infantry, it's frustrating if no one on your team is playing as a pilot or tanker because it usually means that the entire team is nothing but BF-109's dropping bombs on you when you spawn or tanks sniping you from across the map.  The matchmaking is atrocious in this regard, not to mention how long it can take to get into a single match.  Also, I know it's more of an arcade shooter, but it's absolutely ridiculous that I need to use an entire Thompson magazine to kill a guy, or any more than one or two shots from a bolt-action rifle.\n\nPlus, the recent Timoshenko update is terrible.  The Russians are horribly overpowered and you're pretty much guaranteed to lose against them - their weapons and vehicles do way more damage than the Americans or Germans and the Russians also get increased capture and spawn speeds.  Then you even have the lack of initiative the developers are taking against hackers.\n\nProbably the worst of it all is there is shockingly little content for how long the game has been in development.","March 11, 2015","false","34.8"," 41 of 63 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","41","63","0","0"

Some of the mechanics are okay, some aren't; shooting is decent, hit detection is atrocious, and the sheer number of hits some people can survive is bizarre. Are people paying real money for armour that lets them become bullet tanks? I hate this game.\n\nRed Orchestra 2 is better in just about every way; better shooting mechanics, hit detection, graphics, ambiance, gritty warzone feeling, spawning, capturing, everything. Red Orchestra 2 is the game to play if you're looking for WW2 combat. Everything you do in that game is a struggle for control of the battlefield and every kill, suppressing fire, and advance is satisfying and helpful for the entire team. Heroes and Generals completely fails to have that in-depth feel.\n\nStrangely enough, I was excited that this game would be MMO and you could traverse the Western Front and choose where to battle, but you can't, it's not an MMO, it's just done in map instances. Even Red Orchestra 2 has more players per match. Way more. Play Red Orchestra 2 instead of this, you won't be let down.\n\nOh and, Heroes and Generals is pay-to-win.

I tried this game in early early closed alpha years ago, and I've tried it again to see what has changed.  I suppose for the ardent supporters, if they find something redeemable here, they might enjoy it.  I instead was greeted by cheesy mechanics rewarding one hit kills with bolt actions, ineffectual rifles, and an overall feeling of futility as I tried to do anything except die.  If you want to waste your bandwidth and try, by all means I welcome you to it.  This however, isn't a game I would recommend to friends.  The sheer progression for weapons is one of the absolute worst I have seen in a Free2Play game.  I have seen the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Warframe pulls, and this pulls far far ahead.\n\nDo you value that shiny PPsH all the Russians killed them Nazzys with?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardalelist/recommended/227940/","beardalelist","Beardalelist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/beardalelist/","60 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nExperience with Game and "Backstory"At the time I'm writing this review, I have a little over 300 hours invested in this game as a F2P member of the community. I have played the vast majority of this game on one character, a German Infantryman, that I swap to other classes once in a while to change it up, and then swap back to infantry afterwards.\n\nThe following details my lack of general satisfaction with the game and explains my opinion of it being mediocre. Let it be known that when I refer to the community in a negative light, I am not referring to anyone in particular or the whole community - only the select few that bring the group down. Although fun with friends, this game brings nothing new to the table and is just another reskin of your standard F2P FPS model.\n\nTeamwork is Hard to FindThis game is highly repetitive, slow to add new content, and mostly a zerging experience due to lack of coordination in a match even in the presence of a squad leader. There are no voice comms, which would be a downside, but due to the overall cancerous chat I've encountered in nearly every game and everyone wanting to be the hero (placing blame, etc.), I'm very grateful that this is the case - voice comms would be unbearable. This game resembles teamwork and even emulates it sometimes, but unless you run with an outfit or a group of friends, you might as well be playing alone.\n\nFriendly Fire and GriefingAlthough friendly fire is present, it is inconsistent. You can be killed by teammates' grenades, vehicles, bombing-runs, and mines, but not from actual bullets. This, again, lends to the reckless zerging mob that rushes capture points.\n\nThe reporting system is exploitable and never there when it is truly needed.The current system consists of a three-tiered flag - green, yellow, and red. You need at least two flags from one game to be demoted from green to yellow tier. The next match, you need to receive three reports, or three yellow flags, to move into the red tier. The red tier, which activates in yet another match, gets temp-banned after another two reports. The official wiki states "Green flags are not transferred from match to match. Yellow flags are removed 1 for every match you complete with a score above 5 and no Red flags. Red flags are removed 1 every 48 hours." I have seen people exploit this mechanic blatantly, and nothing can be done with the current setup. Multiple times I have been the victim of this explotiation - as long as the griefer doesn't cross into the red, they can kill you much as they want, take a break, and then resume after the yellow flags are removed. The yellow flags are easy to remove, as long as you have more than 5 XP from the match, and you can get high as 200 XP just from being at a point while it's being captured. You only lose 10 XP for team-killing. At the end of the day, they need a system that recognizes trends or something similar to PS2 where the player cannot fire their weapon if they have a certain number of grief points accumulated from damaging friendly players.\n\nPunishing the PlayerThe game has a built in filter for suicides. Suicides delay your respawn by a considerable amount. Methods for suicide include being killed by your own grenades, vehicles, jumping out of moving vehicles, bombing-runs, mines, and falling. I understand the mechanic - it is there to encourage safety and discourage recklessness. I feel like the word "suicide," though, really communicates something different altogether. I have never intentionally killed myself in this game, but I have had accidental deaths. I feel like the vast majority of people don't kill themselves in this game. There is no benefit that I can think of to suicide in H&G. Staying alive and walking to get whatever you need is always a better alternative. If you want to die, all you have to do is stand still in a capture point in the open - someone else would put you out of your misery shortly. Better yet, go look for trouble by walking into the enemies' spawn. Either way, this system is more annoying than anything else. My suicides in this game consist mostly of walking off a ledge about tall as my character while on low health and grenades. Keep in mind, I'm not saying that the suicides should be removed or that you shouldn't be able to accidentally kill yourself - those have to stay for the game to work. I'm saying that suicides for something like walking off a six foot tall ledge shouldn't count as a suicide. You wouldn't even need to check how far the player fell to rule it out. Have the server check the circumstance in which they died - did the player kill themselves or were they killed by another player? If killed by themselves, check the damage done to the player - should it be under a certain threshold to health ratio, let it be ruled a plain death instead of a suicide. Have weighted options for each circumstance surrounding the death (i.e., different damage thresholds for the circumstances). The logic is there, the rule is simple enough to add - it's just a lack of concern as far as I can tell.\n\nCheatingAlthough at the time of this review the devs have gone to respectable lengths to implement anti-cheat systems, I still encounter the same cheaters, cheats, or exploits nearly every game. For the sake of the game, I will not list these exploits publically as I don't want the servers to get any more polluted. Although I understand the lack of a report system within the game itself as it would be abused, it would be nice if there was a more dependable way to report players exploiting the game. Again, I understand the difficulty behind this, but it really does dilute my fun.\n\nRealismAlthough the models for the weapons, vehicles, uniforms, and sounds are spot on, the realism stops there. Beyond the aesthetic, this is just another FPS where stats matter more than common sense.\n\nPricing and the GrindI don't think that this game is pay to win. I do think that players that pay for memberships or buy gold are more apt to have an easier time leveling and acquiring weapons. Your paygrade scales with level, your required experience scales with level. After each match, the player has to pay to refill ammo for any weapons used, pay to repair any weapons or vehicles used. The price increases with the more modifications per weapon for both payments. On a losing match at the top of the leaderboard, I might net 5k credits for use in the shop. On a winning match at the top of the leaderboard, I might net 7k credits for use in the shop. The two weapons that you would spend the most time with as a German Infantry are the Bolt Action Kar. 98 and the MP40. I can't speak for the Kar. at the moment, but the MP40 alone costs around 128k to purchase. For a new player, that is a very long road.\n\nThe anti-tank rockets, such as the bazooka, cost 700 credits a shot. It takes at least two shots to destroy an enemy tank. Over a 30 minute match my side is winning, I might be able to destroy 5 tankers before dipping into my savings. These weapons are given to the new players at level 2 without providing this information - you have to go to the wiki to know many of the repair and refill prices - to wipe out any savings they might have had and coerce them to buy gold or a Veteran membership.\n\nI have 750k saved up and am currently level 13 basically from min-maxing. I don't use modified weapons. I don't use grenades or vehicles beyond a certain threshold. I work the objective.\n\nAll this said, though, I still don't think it's pay to win. I feel that a large amount of this game is in general knowledge of stats, maps and locations, trends, and practice. I'm not saying that you need to be particularly skillful to outperform anyone, just know more than the guy you're shooting at.\n\nConclusionCan't recommend it. Too grindy with too little reward.

Their arent any itstanding bias that are clearly shown in the game itself (YAY RUSSIA ISNT OP) The germans cheer. Well its far from that but the unblanced I talk about is the unblancing of guns. It seems like 90% of the american guns are auto's or semi autos with very very fast rpm. If their bolt action their slow but they pack a hugggge punch (makes sense). But the germans seem to have the Gewehr 43 which is decent and adapatble but slow as agenst any carbines or rifles youll be coming aross. The russians use the Pssh or the Pssd Which is a spray and pray much like the american tompson. Im am a german player who can not compete with such great guns.

Or not, because the cash and game economy are geared to ruin what is otherwise a very fun game.\n\nLet me explain before someone comes up with the pitchforks and torches. Simply put everything in this game costs in game currency, repairs, upgrades, vehicles, the list goes on and on. Put more simply if it is in the game, you will be spending much if not all of what you earn from the in game economy on repairing it. If you go with only the most basic starter stuff, you can keep your costs down enough to actually build up a cash supply. This is because your economy rewards are based on time in match playing, not on things you actually do in match, and all your equipment and ammunition will eat into whatever you get from that at a very rapid pace. This means that unless you are spending large sums of time in match with nothing but the most basic gear you will not be buying or using any of that neat stuff you can unlock.\n\nThere is another way though. Everything, and I do mean everything, in the game can be bought for gold. As usual gold is the cash shop currency used by the devs to pay for their F2P title. Unfortunately the devs took all their cash shop and economy pages from the price gougers guide to pay to win economies. Not only can everything be paid for with gold, all the items locked behind the work of leveling and tasks for earning can be instantly unlocked with it as well. This, when combined with the extremely weak in game economy means it becomes quickly impossible to support anything but that basic starter gear, and makes the paying customers with their automatic weapons, bazookas, and Armored Personnel Carriers very obvious in every match you run into them.\n\nAdding insult to injury, the gold itself is quite expensive compared to what you get for it.\n\nOn the whole, it is a good game, one I desperately want to like if not love, but I think not.","April 6","false","7.8"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","24","34","0","0"

Imagine BF4 but downgraded by 1000000000000000. Yea this game is free but I'd rather pay the 20 bucks the game is worth than playing this game. The progression is super slow, so it's going to take a while to get guns and better vehicles. The only way to get around it is by paying for Gold, which is payed with real money. One of the best weapons in the game is more than 10 bucks... what? Yep more than 10 bucks for one gun, again sorry for comparing, but if you pay another 10 bucks you'll get BF4 which has no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t Gold system and the progression is much faster.\n\nAnother thing about this game is the balance (btw balance is not even a thing in this game). The gun fights are fairly balanced however but the vehicles... just no... Tanks and planes are way to OP in this game since many people do not carry anti-armor weapons. This is because no one starts with anti-armor weapons regarding your class and the rocket launchers are SUPER expensive. There are some AA guns on the maps to take down the planes but it seems as if no one is using them... Side note: The American standard grenades are SUPER OP as well...\n\nAnother thing that factors into the poorly balanced game are the generals. Basically anyone who spits out money can be a freakin general. The role of these generals are to provide you with specific squads in each battle. Each squad has its own purpose and you can only spawn certain vehicles in each squad. Which leads to very unbalanced combat. I've had games where my team has had 6 tanks spawned in and the other team only had less than 3. Vice-Versa, I've  been on teams where we've have no squads to spawn in vehicles leading us to get pooped on (I kinda felt like the other team just finished eating bad truck food and they pooped out the spawn of Satin and made our team eat it).\n\nUm yea................................................................ #bikeSQUAD\nShoutout to my boi Noah and Neil for being the the bikesquad.\nAlso shoutout to my favorite teacher Mr. G\nAlso shoutout to my boi Justin (the baller)\nAlso shoutout to my boi Franco (Horny guy)\nAlso shoutout to my boi Tom (Horny guy #2)","July 22, 2014","false","110.4"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","1"

You're probably wondering, "Why do we need ANOTHER WWII first person shooter? There are hundreds to choose from already!" Yes, while many WWII shooter games are available, this one brings some new aspects to the table. The first thing I praise the game for is its historical accuracy. The guns, the soldier design, the buildings, the battle areas, all of it is so realistic I sometimes forget I'm even playing a game. The graphics are beautiful, but on the downside, the game is poorly optimised as it is still in beta stages. The way you unlock and get new weapons isn't anything unique, a level up and gain experience to unlock weapons system, but I feel the system is very well balanced, unlike many other games. Recently, there has been a lot of conflict about if this game is pay to win, or P2W. My personal opinion on this is that it's more pay to PROGRESS not pay to WIN. A player who earned their weapons and earned the upgrades will still do better than a person who just joined and poured money into getting the perfect weapon. Even though weapon stats help, the game is still more about skill than the right gun. Everybody has their own play style and their own favorite guns and favorite upgrades, there really is no meta. Paying to unlock items in the game is more of saving yourself the grinding. In the game, you can fight for the Axis or the Allies on the western front. The soldiers you can choose from are infantry, tanker, figher pilot, paratrooper, and recon. All the types of soldiers support eachother and play a major roll in the victory. If you play for a while, you can move your soldier up to a general, and command armies to different cities on the map to help lead your side to victory over Europe. Other than minor optimisation issues, I have no problems with this game. It is one of the better WWII first person shooters I've seen out there. The game is free while in beta, so go download it and join the fight!","October 25, 2014","true","553.4"," 43 of 69 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","43","69","0","0"

You can either spend a very long time playing games to get guns, but trust me, it takes A LOT of games. It takes so many to the point where it pretty much tells you "It's so much easier to just buy it, go ahead, BUY THIS GUN." EVERY GUN AND WEAPON ON THE GAME CAN BE PURCHASED VIA REAL MONEY, YOU DONT HAVE TO GRIND, NOR DOES THE GAME ENCOURAGE YOU GRIND TO GET THE GOOD GUNS. They put ads in your face as soon as you log in to tell you to buy this and that.\n\n-No dedicated Infantry-only mode. Every game mode you play in there will be people who bought tanks with real money or in the rare occasion played to get it, but you'll realise how long thatll take. Tanks are ridiculous. They will storm your base and spwn kill you, or sit at every objective and blow you to smitherines. "Just buy a bazooka you nerd" Oh, i'll get to that.\n\n-EVERYTHING YOU USE IN-GAME COSTS IN GAME OR REAL MONEY TO REPAIR.\nWant to save up for that shiny new tommy gun OR THAT SNIPER THAT 1 SHOT KILLS YOU EVERY TIME NO MATTER WHERE ON YOUR BODY YOU ARE SHOT? Well it'll take even longer because every battle you need to pay to repair your gun, refill your ammo and REPAIR YOUR AMMO AND EVEN REPAIR YOUR ATTACHMENTS. Tanks can easily be destroyed by Bazooka rockets, but the ammo and bazooka repairs cost too much. and also, DID YOU KNOW that when your Bazooka is "Broken" or "The ammo is damaged" it costs MORE than you bought it to fix? It's mind boggling. Want to kill the tanks? Get a bazooka. Got a bazooka? Well youre going to be so poor that all you can do is repair your bazooka. Bazooka damaged because you didn't want to rapir it? CANT USE IT. Eventually you won't have enough money to repair your other items or even buy any more new guns. It is a flawed system that will frustrate you into buying stuff with real money. That is exactly what they want and it isn't ♥♥♥♥ing cool.\n\n-The user interface is ugly as ♥♥♥♥ and confusing as hell. If you play the game, you'll see. Open it up and I hope you have some pepto-bismal nearby.\n\nI LOVE THIS GAME. I DO. But the devs really didn't care about a user friendly interface, nor did they care about their community's wallets. The game IS pay to win. Pay to win means, "Want to grind to get the 'good stuff'? you can, and it'll take forever, but look here, you can pay with real money to get ANYTHING you want AND ITLL BE EASY TOO, YOU CAN DO THIS RIGHT FROM THE START, AND WE WONT HESITATE TO SHOW YOU!"\n\nWhat happened to hard work and dedication? Clearly the dev team doesn't know what that is (their UI and their game's motives) and they clearly don't want you to know what it means either.","June 2, 2015","false","23.9"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

But this game really has too many flaws to overlook the good things about it. There is definitley something of a p2w aspect, while it's overcomable on the Heroes side with skill and some luck it is much harder to excuse the p2w aspect when it comes to Generals. It takes forever to grind from Rank 1 to a Rank where you can turn your character into a General (look at my played hours, I still didn't get enough XP to level a General, but I got one single command point so I can control 35 Infantry). Or instead of grinding for hundreds of hours, you can just buy a General.\n\nSome other issues I have with this game:\n-When you're trying to join a match you can't look over your character build or change anything. You can't do anything but chat, and sometimes the queues are obnoxious.\n\n-Matchmaking is funky. There will be matches where too many people spawn in tanks/planes or everyone is infantry even though there are tanks and planes avaliable to your side, and then the enemy is evenly outfitted with a good mix of armor/infantry/air.\n\n-Matchmaking wouldn't be so bad if you could more easily change characters in a match. Mostly I say that due to wanting to bring an anti-tank character into matches where we just get overwhelmed by top-tier tanks and the rest of the team is full of new players.\n\n-Matchmaking doesn't always mesh well with an RTS strategy of blocking certain lines because one side will have been matched to a game where they have 35 spawns from the attempted block and the other team has hundreds. Winnable? I guess, but it's like fighting as Sparta in 300.\n\n-Spawn camping can be an issue, like most games. Spawning on top of enemies/enemies spawning on you is also an issue.\n\n-Level design is average, because it has some fairly well designed stuff (like the Town overall is well designed), and then some not so well done stuff (like the factory level which they may be changing in the future). Their first Airfield map is fun, but suffers from too much open space where you're forced to use vehicles (so if your team is full of new people you'll be stuck with bicycles and old pickup trucks to get around while the other team will have motorcycles, jeeps, and APCs, possibly even tanks and planes!)  More trenches and/or fox holes would be both a welcome change and more realistic.\n\n-Lack of a good tutorial level. The one they have is singleplayer and teaches you how to shoot/move, doesn't teach you about other gameplay basics from multiplayer. No tutorial/shooting range for tanks or planes so any person who grinds for a tank or a plane has to go into matches to just figure out the controls. The tank controls are fine, but the plane controls take some getting used to.\n\n-Two Map Types. I don't really like King of the Hill type matches in general, so I don't really play those much. Their assault/defense maps can be interesting, but suffer from a lot of noobness due to the lack of a proper tutorial.\n\n-Shooting people coming out of a vehicle takes practice because the animations for the transition between in-vehicle and stepping out of it aren't that smooth yet. (That's what I remember at least)\n\n-Not enough sprint for the map sizes.\n\n-Melee hitboxes need to be bigger\n\nDid I have fun in this game? Yes.\nIs is flawed? Definitely.\nOther than the flaws it is a game I enjoy because, while it takes some getting used to, I think it's a good WW2 FPS that feels more realistic than COD.","June 5, 2015","false","632.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","0"

I worked my way up to Recon when the game first came out, even payed for a year long Veterans Pass, JUST so I could get a scoped rifle. It took me FOR EVER!!! With each update this game releases, is almost a slap in the face for us original players.\n\nThis is the worst game I have ever experienced when it comes to campers, farming lives, and "spawn rapers" ... Tanks will sit in the distance so far away that it's impossible to get close un noticed. Anti Armor weapons cost a lot to repair, and most of the time will still say "Armor Too Thick" if you don't hit it perfect.\n\nBUT, my biggest problem with the game, is the lack of realism. I have shot an enemy point blank in the face with a completely upgraded 1903, and died in the fire fight, just to see that the shot didn't even take a sliver of health away. (Because it always shows you who killed you, with their health meter.)\n\nI have shot my bazooka at a person, hit within 1 foot of them, and they ALWAYS survive! But Grenades blow you to hell... The matches are horribly imbalance, the wait time to get into matches takes WAY TOO LONG especially playing WAR. And I will never recommend this game unless you are an absolute Camper.\n\n2 Thumbs down. Used to love this game. Now I'll be waiting for Batalion 1944 to come out.

It is no where near a free to play game especially for new players. I am an ironsight player from other WW2 games all the way up to modern FPS games and the sights for this game are just horrendous.\n\nMap layout- The layout for each map are excruciatingly uneven especially with spawn points being steps away from a capture point. Spawn camping is a common occurence with high ranking players going behind the spawn and shooting those who have just spawned. Many maps are so uneven that if you get the good spawn that no matter how bad your team is you will still win.\n\nWeapons- Starter weapons are starters they aren't the best but they should still be able to do damage, they kinda don't. Yeah they hit but they don't deal nearly any damage. If you want a new gun even a low tier new gun be ready to empty what little credits you get to get that gun and hope its good(whitch it isn't). If you use a gun or GRENADE too much you have to repair it. Yes you have to repair a GRENADE!!!!!! The expense of repairing a weapon  or GRENADE is about the same price as a new gun. So if you can't afford a new gun, you may not be able to even play the game.\n\nFree to Play- Yes you can download it and play a few games for free. But if you run outta credits early on you may have to wait to even play. Or you can shell out money to play. I have played world of tanks, War thunder, and other WW2 FtP games and have never been bombarded so much to buy gold to even get farther into a game.

On a regular basis we're forced to fully re-install the game due to both malicious files being downloaded, and false positive reactions from our security software.\n\nReto-Moto is aware of their own problems but nothing is done to fix it. It was not until this got my attention Reto-Moto with haste also made a thread with a step-by-step guide how to remove said malware to redeem themselves after I openly confronted them on the Steam Dicussions for Heroes & Generals. My posts kept getting deleted by Reto-Moto representatives until they decided to try and keep me from spreading the news by banning me for the ridiculous reason: "Repeated spreading of information, bad reviews". In a nutshell I was banned for writing this review.\n\nA game where we pay for our items incidents like this just can't happen. What guarantee do we have that whoever made a miscalculation and infected their own servers with malware in the server department won't do it again? I recommend to wait until Reto-Moto either hires people who are trained and know what they are doing, or if you're adventurous be sure to have updated and good antivirus and antimalware when playing Heroes & Generals. Having followed the development of the game since early Alpha stage I've been forced to install three different internet security applications to stop Reto-Moto sneaking malicious files into my system. This may sound outrageous, but use the search feature on the Community for Heroes & Generals and I can guarantee you that you'll find many discussions on the matter.\n\nCensorship and Horrible FeedbackThey use censoring as a solution to safeguard their already ill reputation as apparently they are terrified of their reputation. This however is not justified to ignore their community by silencing them. If we take a closer look at the official Heroes & Generals forum, where the community is growing at its strongest, several topics appear each day where Reto-Moto is criticized directly for both their censorship and their poor community feedback. They claim to listen to what the community want for their game, but unfortunately they are falling very short on the listening. Reto.Splixxen, the Questions and Answers Manager at Reto-Moto have stated at numerous occasions that community feedback occuring on their forum in the form of threads with justified topics or polls where the majority want something changed is "nonconstructive feedback".\n\nOne scenario that actually happend that is still making me nauseous is a thread was created consisting of a well known problem with the game. A poll was made and within days it had reached over 250 votes in favor for the suggestion in question. Reto.Splixxen made another statement claiming, "The issue is being debated, but saying that a post with 70 people is a samplesize enough to cover the community is not enough". He chose to ignore the rest of the participants to avoid having to make changes to the game. They want to develop their own game and completely boycott feedback from their customers. Today the poll is still active now with almost 400 votes in favor, yet Reto-Moto keep ignoring the community from their nonconstructive feedback baloney. Heroes & Generals is their child, they are ridiculously overprotective and don't let anyone close to their precious little brat. But all children need to attend their teachers at school, which is us the community. Reto-Moto chose to homeschool their child instead, and thus the game only get what they believe is the best for it.\n\nReto-Moto is an incompetent game developer who would rather create their own private game and drink beer than listen to constructive feedback from their community. They use censorship as their primary tool to keep the community in line, and when you register on their forum you sign an unwritten agreement to be exposed to their senseless and abusive authority. If you decide to keep playing the game you run the constant risk of having  malicious files downloaded to your computer because the gorillas at their server department can't keep their internet security and firewall up to date. Heroes & Generals is not going places until Reto-Moto start prioritizing their community over their own ego. I don't recommend Heroes & Generals to anyone in its current state.","October 16, 2015","false","336.9"," 100 of 174 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","100","174","8","9"

Heroes and Generals is a World War 2 FPS where players can be foot soldiers, airplane pilots, paratroopers and more. This game is not so fast paced and is more about taking a slow approach to attack your enemy and does have a little RTS twist.However,this game fails to suffice at many of these. This game has a good concept,but it doesn't work.This game is all purely pay-to-win. Let me sum it up. Firstly is the FPS aspect. Ranking up is hard and the game is unbalanced, players who pay more money get better weapons and the weapons are unbalanced, for example the MG-34 has the same accuracy, precision, recoil and damage as the MG-42 yet the MG-42 fires faster. This game also has RTS features, I am a HUGE fan of RTS, but in the game you have to pay at least 35 dollars to play as a general. Greed of the developers screwed up this game.","December 22, 2014","false","32.3"," 54 of 90 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","54","90","0","10"

If not, well you will have a terrible time. If you play skirmish, you will be sniped, blownup, or gunned down by tanks or snipers across the map. Not to mention all of the hackers.\n\nIf you do buy a sniper, be aware that the unlocks for it will not be available until you reach rank 9 and go recon. There is nothing on the weapon info that says that.\n\nAlso since not all the sounds register for some odd ♥♥♥ reason, if youre being shot, your only hint is where you were shot from. Unless its a sniper or a tank. Than youre probably dead as those two classes are completely over powered. You cant hear your teammates shot and you can only hear every 5th bullet if youre being shot at by an enemy.\n\nI mean lets face it. Things are too vague, theres not enough information on weapons. For example: i bought a sniper. No where did it say i had to unlock it normally to be able to upgrade it. I email support, they say "you buy it to have early access to it." If i would of known i had to unlock it first, I never would of bought it. Descriptions are too vague and theres not enough information.\n\nHeres the exact email:\nHello Deadly,\n\nUpgrades for scoped rifles can only be purchased and equipped by Recon characters.\nThe information in the ribbon progression overview for the Sniper Assault ribbon is incomplete in this respect: your Rifleman *does unlock* the weapon upgrades, but he *can't buy/equip them* until he changes careers to becomes a Recon.\n\nThe scoped rifle is still a very powerful weapon even without modifications.\nRiflemen can only unlock scoped rifles very far down the BA Ribbon progression tree.\nWhat you purchased with Gold is the possibility to unlock this weapon early.\n\nSee you soon on the battlefield!\n\n\n__________\n\nBest regards,\nHeroes & Generals Support Center\nReto.Fox\n\nGameplay 0/10 Pay to win's everywhere. For a staged war, it says its "Balanced". Its not, either Germany's over powered with tanks, or the US is over powered with tanks. Since russias the new faction, they have the worst amount of stuff.\n\nLeveling system: 1/10 Too slow and so much grinding. Example: went 22/12 and half of my kills were headshots with a bolt action. how much xp did I get for the match? 42 xp when i need about 50k for the next rank. Also my deaths were from tanks, hackers that have no-recoil, and snipers.\n\nVehicals: 3/10 What are physics? When you go off a jump at a highish speed on a motorcycle, you do flips, spins, and very rarely you will land on 2 wheels w/o that stuff. Also, you can flip tanks on pebbles, you tap a rock with a jeep or a motorcycle, it explodes, Tanks sniping players across the map.\n\nWeapons: 3/10 Clunky. You know the feeling. They feel heavy and a pain to carry around.\n\nUntil they fix it, i give it a 3/10. I think im being generous.","March 25, 2015","false","42.8"," 67 of 114 people (59%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","59","67","114","14","1"

And it took quite a while to get that stuff as it was, you learned early that you play a bazooka guy and use that setup occasionally and use those rounds sparingly or litterally pay the price for the reload of ammo after the match. About half of the time here you see recorded I am a tanker and given that I still only have two med tanks and please don't get the Lee if you don't have a friend in it with you and you both don't have a sense of humor. The cash shop today is not what it was when I started, now I'm affraid you are going to at the very least have to pay for premium time, which is not over the top in price just to even get enough in game cash to buy things in game or ribbons to accelerate your soldiers progress exp.\n\nAs to P2W even now I would say that is not true, head shots w/ any weapon killl just the same. Snipers that don't take arc in to concideration won't hit anything at any level. People that don't burst their weapons and burn a whole clip on knowing the spray pattern gets worse the longer you lay on the trigger, well just get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and rage that the weapon can hit SH#T!!! which even starter weapons do just fine once you learn how to use them. The only exception to this is the MG42 is a beast, at least it can't snipe like it use to.\n\nThe community has imho a lot of rage gamers, which is my biggest turn off. But given the amount of cash you get paid for a win vs. a loss you could almost understand it.\n\nSo to sum it all up\n\nPositives:\n\n1. Faced paced combat in fairly large maps\n2. Graphics are good\n3. Sound, use your sound and don't play music too loud it will save your life....LOL\n4. Non campaign ques are short (you can play everything here you could in campaign)\n5. Has in game comms, if you have a mic. (most don't use it though I don't know why)\n\nNegatives:\n\n1. Advancement w/o premium boost can hurt advancement\n2. Community is a little hostile I would compair it to LoL (League of Legends) if you know that game\n3. Still even today don't see the advantage at all to play campaign theater, no real upside. Community just get worse in        attitudes when they are losing. And you get no real feel or bonus for your side winning.\n5. Campaign ques can take up to 10 - 15min\n6. No punishment for quiters really  and you can lose a ton of matches that way 15 v 3 games.\n\n\nSo until they adjust the cash shop stuff again to make it more in balance with a true F2P ( And I do believe in supporting what you play as they too need to feed the family) I say keep looking.\n\nRed Orcastra maybe Verdun? Or make sure that you play with at least 4 friends or more to make up some of the negatives listed above.\n\nI hope this helped   :)\n","August 1, 2015","false","249.3"," 38 of 61 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","38","61","0","1"

Because it isn't badly done.\n\nIt's a f2p game, but it's mostly pay2avoidgrind. There are some p2w elements to it, but I've not noticed them have any significant impact on the game. You gain the free currency fast and unlock the gear quickly. I was in a tank with a big gun on it by my second night of playing. The interesting part is that the starter tank with a machine gun isn't actually bad. Infact, it's pretty good. You're essentially a metal box of anti-infantry that can park in any barn you want. It works well and you don't feel crapped on from above just because you're not shelling out money on unlocking upgrades quicker with real cash.\n\nThe weapons are heavily customisable and they actually make a difference. I have an SMG that fires so fast that at least one person has accused me of hacking because of it. Wonderful thing since i'm such a crap shot.\n\nYou can also steal bicycles and give people backies. Which is clearly a major selling point.\n\nThe game itself is very basic, there's not much to it. It's a WW2 shooter which feels to me like Day of Defeat on Battlefield sized maps. But it's nothing special, just a shooter.\n\nBut it has me hooked, I've no idea why. The game is average but the fact that it's a f2p game that doesn't feel like i'm forced to pay up to keep up has me smirking as i sit in my little tank gunning down anyone that comes near the cap point. I could use a bigger tank, sure. You gain currency just as quickly as you gain unlocks. But I don't want to, because everything in this game, from basic gear to bigger gear has it's place.\n\nI'm still confused as to exactly what it is about this game I like. Maybe it's just simply because it's hitting all the right notes for a f2p game that wants to include a p2w element but doesn't feel like a monster grind or keeping me down because of it. Maybe it's because the game is barebones but feels like it has a lot of content to it and will only have more on the way?\n\nOr maybe it's just because I can steal some American's bicycle for the glorious Fatherland.","August 31, 2014","true","28.0"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","0"

Maybe they dont care and just sold out their fans for a check, but I dont blame them we would all do the same right? I would not be the only one willing to pay to get all those microtransactions off of the game so that we could have a wholesome gaming experience.\n\n1.8/10.0 was once a 9.4/10.0\n\nIn depth:\n- Leveling WAS well balanced, you could level up without being forced to buy a trained character. Now leveling is so broken (or stratigized) that you have to buy a Luitenent if you want to try the second half of the game.\n- This game was kind of cool and unique, not it is just another pay to play peice of garbage\n- All the purchasable money and them trying to force purchases down our throats is immersion breaking...\n- I used to love the days where you would spend money on the acutal puchase title and would get levels and items buy         earning them, even in game unbuyable money would work (example fallout caps).\n- I loved this game and would have paid $34.99 to buy, own, play it even if it wasnt free (probably not the only one), I think what was done to make this game avaliable to the masses was its downfall and the reason it isnt more popular (look at minecraft, great game but doesnt cost any money).\n- Speaking of minecraft, knock off games are made all the time now, if they dont fix it im sure someone will help us with a better game. Supply and demand!\n\nP.S.\nPlease dont be too affended I just got off the game and was very frustrated by all the wallet warriors (other euphemisms here).

There are a lot of people who don't like it, and I get it. Ive got 350 hours in the game, and when I ever have a large streak of kills, I could understand the anger from my victims. 2 years ago, the game was not like this. Literaly everyone was at the same level, so grinding was a piece of cake. As time passed, more and more people got better weapons, and that was that. Then a surge of people joined, and once they reached level 5, they were put into games with experience players, (such as I) all with one shot rifles up to an insane range. Guilty as charged. And it does not stop at the rifles. Even pistols can be upgraded to be a 3 shot kill at 50m. Also guilty as charged. So anyone who says the game is "Pay to Win", is partialy right. But it was not always that way. I had my friends play with me, and they were very angry at how the starting weapons are absolute garbage, and that they were dying too easily. The game has so much potential, but it is really only fun for people who have played for long enough.\nTLDR;\nThe game is at this point, a pay to win.\nStill fun to play though.","April 13","false","395.7"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","22","32","0","0"

Some of the changes are minor, and some of them are game changing (read: game breaking).

I spent so much time on this game as it used to be fine, but now it's not in a good spot. There are lots of issues, as it's expected for a game that has been in beta since forever and probably will stay like that. First the worst thing that drives off so many people is the fact that the game runs poorly on any system that costs under 800$. There are also many "bugs" that mess up your framerate badly, and require you to change some of your system settings to work properly. Also, there are lots of P2W elements, such as the ability to unlock the highest rank the second you start the game... for money of course.\nIf you want to get this game, just wait until the bugs are fixed and the balance is sorted out.","April 2","false","210.7"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","64","29","45","7","1"

This was my most favorite game with everything I had been looking for in a ww2 shooter, that was until a recent patch made my favorite, the recon class all but useless with changes to the scope.\n\nIf you like sniping aka recon in H&G this is not the game for you. Unlike other games you need to invest a large portion of time leveling a basic infantry soldier before you can unlock recon. Once you unlock recon you are then able to use a scoped bolt action, this is great however the scope is so blurry and does not zoom in very far. You are better off trying to scout and aim at enemies using your binoculars then quickly switching to your gun and taking a shot hoping the target doesn't move as binoculars zoom in about 5 times more and is clear.\n\nPreviously the scope on the recon rifles were like that of the binoculars however with the recent patch recon is a waste of time.\n\nIf you want to drive a tank or fly a plane this game still has its up sides however if you play recon like me spend your 500+ hours playing something else.","December 12, 2015","false","589.6"," 44 of 73 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","44","73","4","1"

You have to create one soldier for every type of specialization needed in the game.

Instead of allowing this the game deleted all of the items that he had purchased with real world currency and the devs refused to honor his request for the items to be given back.\n\nIn an email with a dev by the name of Reto.Gargamel he said "It would be bad business practice for us to allow players to cancel their all their purchases at any time". I would agree with this if you didn't allow the character to be deleted and thus lose all of his real world currency purchases because of a terribly confusing UI.\n\nNot sure if Reto realizes what "bad business" actually means.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/takilung/recommended/227940/","takilung","Tak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/takilung/","106 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHaving played the game for quite some time now so I guess i will write a review.\n\nSeems like alot of people complained and thinks this is a completely pay to win game. Well the most notable pay to win element in this game is the Badge and the extra equipment slot. As of the newest update everything can now be bought with credits. (Even Veteran membership and academy trained soldiers/ skins)\n\nfor me a war batttle lasted around 30 minutes can earn me 15k credits, with 26k credits you can buy a 15 rank academy trained infantry with high salary which will help you to make credits even faster.\n\nthis is a good start to make it less pay to win. if someone were to spent real money in this game they have to spent quite alot powerlevelling all those ribbons to max ranks to unlock those items not to mention then to buy them with gold. to unlock the heavy tank for example would need to spent over 25000+ gold and its totally not worth it now.\n\nSecond most pay to win element is the Strategic part of the game, the War is another different matter, it is about who has the most Generals/ active players = wins. With the introduction of bonus EXP and credits to war newbies are now storming War battles and it made it really unbalanced when stock infantry vs infantry full of smgs/ mgs. This needs to be looked at\n\nThere are also issues with people complaing about getting banned without any reason. Look for this topic about what software is prohibited.\nhttp://support.heroesandgenerals.com/Knowledgebase/Article/View/19/0/prohibited-software\n\nWhen they go to support it says they have been banned for cheating. The devs in this game takes this cheating business very serious, they have made it so when the game is running it will literally scans your PC to check if you are running any cheats on, so if you are running cheat engine to cheat on a flash game while Heroes and Generals is on, be expected that you will be perma-banned the next day when you log in.\n\nAs for gameplay I still cannot understand why the devs rejects the idea of having voice chat in game, they could also implement a mute button so for those who don't like voice chat they can simply turn it off, with the voice chat it can make the game better especially when you are working with a tanker/ communicate with your team. The game is sure fun but it is 100% not fun when you are playing and joining a match that is already half-way through, what this means is that when you joined and the match ends you won't earn any credits at all (This needs serious fixing since this happened to 6/10 of my skirmish games).\n\n\nThen theres people who complained about the low FPS while playing the game. Well you actually do need to have a decent PC to play this, do check this link to check if you are capable of running it. Before I bought a decent gaming PC I was constantly getting 10-30 fps in the lowest settings and it is pretty frustrating. In the future hopefully the dev will optimize the game to be on par with other AA+ titles out there.\nhttp://www.heroesandgenerals.com/community/game/user-guide/getting-started\n\nAlso to note the max player size currently for both teams is 36. Hopefully this will change in the future as it will definitely making the game more epic than the small battles we have now. Hopfully one day the British and the Japanese will be added to make this game alot better and it will become one of the very finest WW2 MMOFPS out there.\n\nThe tank balance in the newest update is now more balanced than before. Before Axis tanks literally is the worst in everything except Heavy Tanks and there are some errors which T-34-75 surpass the T-34-85 by 2 shotting most tanks while the 85 can.\n\nThe only problem i had with the current update is the introduction of scopes to infantry with their 1 hit kill rifles. This now makes it very unbalanced compared to a recon since playing recon now is useless. Not only infantry has more equipment slots they can also one shot people with ease and the only advantage recon has is a better scope and better mods. This has lead to massive sniping grounds in lots of War battles where everyone is just camping, not capturing objective and is just spawn killing everyone. As a result of this alot of new players rage quits.\n\nAs of now the game is definitely more playable and less pay to win than before. The game can be grindy yes but it is much better now with the increased earning rate plus the bonus to war. (before playing in war grant you no advantage but now people are actulaly playing war everynow and then).","February 19, 2015","true","476.9"," 115 of 204 people (56%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","56","115","204","10","4"

That is the basic summary of this game.  It's not early access.  It's been around since 2011/2012.  This game will never leave beta, as the devs don't want to lose that excuse.\n\nThis game is great until about 100 hours in, then you start to see all the flaws.  Things like a horrible match-maker (being put into games that are 30 seconds away from ending), garbage physics (a tank can flip if it hits a bicycle), bugs that are never addressed (spawn your tank upside down anyone?) and inept devs that rarely communicate with the user base and clearly only care about profit (raise in price for vet membership at same time you greatly nerf XP gains, then more recently nerf ribbon XP gain by a (user base) reported 75%?).  It's clear what these devs value.  Then there are the issues with the RTS side.\n\nIt's a real shame because the game concept isn't bad.  It can be quite fun, if your teammates aren't complete idiots that spend the whole round trying to snipe, using non sniper rifles (not just non-scoped rifles, but fools using SMG's and LMG's like they're snipers) or completely ignoring the objectives in the game.\n\n*edit*\nThe devs scaled back the ribbon xp nerf after the tears and gnashing of teeth by the playerbase, myself included.  A definite +1 for the devs.  Wish I could say that more often.  I still think wasted potential is the best description for the game, but it's in a fairly playable/reasonable state right now.  Good enough for a free game.  Too bad I can't give this game a neutral rating.","June 5, 2015","false","789.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

In this aspect of the game it is fun, however the game quickly lost my intrest. I am a vertan FPS player and i have decent aim. i have many hours logged in various games and the biggest issue i have with this game is that it does not reward players well for there achivments.

It combines FPS with the ability to influence the war in a RTS part. It has the protential to be an amazing gaming experience.\n\nUnfortunately, it struggles to reach a status any higher than this. It had great potential when i first played it before it was on steam. I occasionally returned just to see that all the basic flaws did not get fixed or were made even worse over a period of over 2 years.\n\nBiggest drawbacks for me (besides clunky interfaces, bugs and other technical issues that could be forgiven for a game in BETA) are: 1. The horrible grind (it takes very long to unlock troop classes, weapons, equipment, ranks), 2. The insanely messed up economy. You pay for everything-  used bullets, used grenades, vehicle repairs (only if you spent 100 hours to unlock them in the first playce lol), even if you use a scope you have to repair it for credits or gold after battle! The prices are also out of sanity. You have to pay nearly 100k credts for a bolt action rifle (and get like 5k max as a beginner per battle). Depending on your view it makes this game either a pay2win or pay2play. 3. The online game with the most unstable servers i've ever played. 4. It also has a very unbalanced faction population (get ready to get stomped by german faction a lot).\n\nIt's also very beginner unfriendly. You start with crappy equipment and get matched against people who play the game for a long time and have unlocked all the good stuff. And it is expensive and takes a long time to get on a somewhat even level. Until that point you basically get slaughtered a lot.\n\nAlso, the devs seem to like to annoy you and take stuff away from you. For example, a few updates ago everyone was able to take part in the RTS part of the game, buy som assault teams and send them into battle. Then they decided you have to grind out a general (which basically takes some 300 hours playtime or 50€ worth of gold) to be able to do that. Suddenly half of the game was locked away.\nOr you grind to unlock a tank, you use that tank a lot, and they decide to put in a special ribbon for that tank that makes you have to unlock ammo types before you can effectively use it in war etc...\n\nTL DR: The game can be fun if you don't expect anything good from it. If that's not your attitude, i don't recommend it","August 23, 2015","false","568.1"," 51 of 88 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","51","88","0","3"

It's totally awesome. The gameplay is sensational. I really enjoyed it. The UI was a little clunky but okay, I could deal with it. It's a fantastic game. However.. The in-game currency system is a sham. You have to pay for EVERYTHING. Every single little thing you want to change about your character or even KEEP PLAYING, you have to pay. It's such a shameless method of the Developers forcing you to keep playing the game more! What's worse? If you choose a new career path after spending AGES getting to Rank 5, YOU HAVE TO PAY to change. This limits all your character options back to Lv.1 again. So you start from scratch, again. You also can't use certain weapons. So what if you wanna swap back to the career you've already unlocked?... YOU HAVE TO PAY AGAIN!! I've wasted 100,000 finding that out! You only get about 7,000 per game!! I am constantly taxed on every piece of this game. I olve playing it, but this is well enough to force me to stop. Let us play the F-ing game!!!

In fact, it could've been one of the best WW2 games. I really, REALLY want to recommend this because I myself am a fan of FPS, Large-scale battles and WW2 and I was surprised on the variety of ww2 weapons and the skirmishes actually feel realistic and the feeling of needing to go prone in a field of heavy gun fire is amazing. Unfortunately, however, to get all the good stuff you're gonna have to grind..... a LOT. The game has a progression system so very slow that it is almost excruciatingly painful and after all the grind for experience. The weapon you worked so hard for is overpriced (92k for a slightly more accurate and lower rof version of the starting weapon). And a thing to note is reaching tier 2. Maybe you dominated everything in the first ranks with your modded grease gun or your accurate sniping with the Karabiner 98 and maybe you've gotten a lot of driving experience from your trusty GAZ and then you reach tier 2.... Holy ♥♥♥♥. Before you know it you'll get killed by a guy with an MG42 or get spawncampeed by a plane. The thing is that, this game has so much potential but a very problematic execution. Don't take this review saying "This game sucks!" cause it is in fact good and I would support Reto into making this game better.I just want people to wait until this game is completely finished cause only then they will realize how great it is.","January 13","false","137.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","1"

Even if you DO happen to grind out all the necessary experience to unlock all the mods required (and they cost a fkn ton of credits - in game currency- ) you STILL won't be able to one shot kill a lot of the "vets" because they have the Heavyset Gold badge (a perk that allows you to take 15% less damage)\n\nWell big deal, right?  After a few weeks, I can grind it out and be on a level playing field, right?\n\nNOPE.  Only if you some how are able to cram in 400+ hours of game time into those 2 weeks.\n\nReto has literally gone full ♥♥♥♥♥♥ with this last update, blatantly playing the greed card in an effort to coerce any new player or player who wants to unlock weapons/vehicles/mods in order to enhance their playing experience (basically, even the playing field) to spend hundreds of dollars.\n\nEven if you DO spend the necessary money/gold to unlock a weapon or vehicle...you cannot pay to unlock/progress the mod/badges that play such a vital role in the efficiency of your character/weapon/vehicle.  You can only do that by grinding the exp, by killing enemy after enemy or driving around for literally 20+ hours.\n\nOh, think you've found a smart way to get exp, by just shooting your gun into the air for an entire match?  Driving around in circles?  Cycling a bike for 30+ min?  Nope, that's "EXPLOITING" and for that you can enjoy a PERMANENT BAN.   I'm not even making this stuff up.\n\nI haven't even TOUCHED on the other negatives of this game, which there are a few.\n\n-matchmaking is completely absent - you'll get put in games that are almost over, located on the other side of the planet, one team is STACKED while the other is newbs\n-graphics are subpar, not what you see in the trailers at all\n-optimization issues galore\n-terrible menuing interface, since the game uses browser plugins\n-movement and gravity feels like you're on the moon, not Earth\n-vehicles drive/fly like they're just bricks with wheels/treads/wings\n-it costs credits to maintain your weapons/mods and replenish ammo.  You have a KDR of 30:1 and an objective score of 10 caps and still actually come out in a credit deficit, making it a ridiculous treadmill to try to save up enough credits to buy new weapons (assuming you have the patience to unlock them)\n\nHonestly, the game was fun for a while, because it's been so long since I've played a combined arms WW2 game...but the novelty has worn off, the glaring faults have shone through, and most of all, the developer has shown their true colours.\n\nMy only regret is giving them any money at all, as scumbaggery like this should not be rewarded in any form.\n\nHopefully another developer out there will see what H&G has done and how badly they've dropped the ball and fill the demand for a good, balanced, fair, PREMIUM tactical combined arms WW2 shooter.\n\nThis game had promise, it really did....but like most early access and f2p games... it falls short of the mark by too much.\n\nFor shame.","June 9, 2015","false","143.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

For a beta game it is FANTASTIC.  Far above COD and the Battlefield franchise in my opinion.  The game is very immersive and intense at times. The game does have some issues, but what Beta game doesn't?  If you're looking for some negatives, the hit detection is not always spot on (this has become very rare), sometimes you will be completely outnumbered, which isn't the developer't fault, it is the generals'.  As any game, it has things that you will love and you will hate.  Overall, this is probably the best FPS I have ever played.  I rank it right up in my books with COD 4.\n\nPeople keep calling this game a "Pay to Win" game.  It is not.  You can purchase anything from weapons to tanks, and with the tanks, sure, you can pay to get a better tank.  But as far as an form of ground troop, the weapon only means so much.  It would be the equivalent of you being able to buy the highest level assault rifle in Call of Duty.  It really comes down to skill, as the rifle is not going to make that much of a difference to be game changing.

Id never tested a game before so once id researched the game for a while i signed up for a closed beta key and installed the game.\n\nAt first it was all a little confusing but overtime i figured out how it all worked and became more and more engrossed in the game and was intrested enough to be still playing over three years later.The game has changed alot since those early days some of it good and some not so good, they have added alot of nice toys to play with and some cool maps to fight on although there are only a few maps compared to other games i thought its fine as i guess its easier to test a few maps rather than twenty or thirty so reto can refine their map building skills.\n\nThe one thing that changed the most for me is the grind at first it was easy to level up and build an army but as time has gone on the grind has increased to a point where its really hard work to get anywhere even for me having played for so long and can understand why so many new players have problems with this but things change over time and im hoping that Reto tone down the grind a bit but being an mmo and comparing it to other mmo's its not much different to those.\n\nTHIS PARAGRAPH IS OBSOLETE SINCE EVERYTHING INGAME CAN NOW BE BOUGHT WITH CREDITS BUT WILL LEAVE IT IN INCASE THINGS CHANGE.\n(Alot of people claim this is a pay to win game and there seems to be alot of confusion as to what a pay to win game is, for me its a pay to advance quicker game over the time ive played it ive spent only a little bit of cash as im a low wage earner and dont often have cash to spare id say its around £50 in the time ive been playing which isnt alot but ive always spent my gold on vet status, i never buy weapons or tanks etc as they can all be unlocked by playing the game some people dont want to wait to unlock items but for me vet status is a better way of spending your gold and maybe a ribbon xp booster now and again and at the end of the day i will open those items sooner or later.)THIS LAST PARAGRAPH IS OBSOLETE SINCE EVERYTHING INGAME CAN NOW BE BOUGHT WITH CREDITS BUT WILL LEAVE IT IN INCASE THINGS CHANGE.\n\nOverall im happy for the most part with the games progression new builds are always welcome good or bad as things that dont work or need changing do eventually get fixed or changed maybe not right away but as im in this for the long haul im ok to wait and let Reto make the game better and we nomally see new builds every three or four months which is fine with me.Cant say im 100% happy with everything reto have done but ive made my points of view clear on the forums which Reto do actually read and they do interact with people playing the game. they have even shown up in some of the twitch streams ive been watching.\n\nAs for cheaters and hackers since i started playing ive only come across one guy who i thought may be cheating he somehow knew where i was even though he couldnt see me he came round the corner and i was killed really fast maybe he was cheating or just knew the map really well and knows all the places people defend from but i trust Reto when they say that most cheat and hack reports are usually just players that are really good or new people who dont realise how the game works.\n\nSo if your gamer who likes a challenge and doesnt mind putting the time into a game and maybe a little cash i do recommend this game as it stands now yes it has its problems and some may say its been in beta too long but if your prepared to give the devs the time they need i can recommend this game. For those of you expecting to have everything unlocked in a week or two and a bug free game ( after all thats why im testing it) its not the game for you.\n\nmy apologies for making such a long review but i felt i needed too, to give this game the review it deserves as its clearly a game i enjoy playing.\n\nP.S People seem to have a problem with the matchmaker which i get and the community have asked Reto to remove it but it wont happen,my advice if playing campaign battles its always better to join manually from the campaign map just check the resources for your faction first and make sure you have enough.\n\nhope to see you in game\n\nenglishkernigit ;)","February 2","true","119.8"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

Its gotten to the point that 8/10 times I try to play I end up getting extremely frustrated. There are a few rare games that get really heated up and fun to play that last over 30 minutes to an hour long. Faction weapons feel horribly unbalanced. I recently became a tanker with a German and found out that the default tank is SUPER UNBALANCED compared to the American light tanks. You fire infantry-grade machine guns at enemy Chaffees that two shot you. You'd have to play with another guy if you ever want to upgrade your tank (so that you can earn credits to buy a medium tank). This is just one of the many painstaking grinds that this game has to offer. I won't even begin with my struggle to become Recon... The only reason I have 152 hours right now is that my friend and I have a fun time playing it together.\n\nPlaying this game with a friend will make it fun and toleratable.  For example: He has a heavy tank and I use my recon class to go spot enemy vehicles for him as I implement Viet Cong Tactics to keep enemy units from reaching our cap point. We also have fun riding around in the Recon's Anti-Personal Vehicle (which I still don't understand why THE RECON CLASS IS ALLOWED TO HAVE). We play it every now and then for ***** and giggles until one of us finally gets tired of being ♥♥♥♥♥ by all the automatic weapons that the other two factions get.\n\nThere are three factions: Germany, Soviets, and the Americans. Germany I feel has horribly under powered weapons *cough* machinepistol 34 *cough* (does less damage than my c36 pistol :/ ) and I find myself having to pick up enemy weapons such as the AUTOMATIC CARBINES THAT AMERICA AND SOVIET RUSSIA DID NOT HAVE. The PTRD for the Soviets has got to be the icing on the cake because it can two shot my Anti-Personel Vehicle (skdftzz 222) which really doesn't seem right. The Russian APV is armored to the teeth but only has machine guns on it (which I believe is a good balance decision on Reto's part and I wish that they could implement that kind of balancing alot more often). All of these vehicles, weapons, attachments, ammunition all cost ingame credits (or a little-bit of micro-transaction) to purchase and maintain.\n\nThe final part of this game that both breaks it and makes it are the devs themselves. Reto-Moto is a development company that I believe is worse than EA. That has to atleast say something coming from a player who has witnessed this game since 2015 when I watched Frankie play it. Those were the days that they had actually envisioned great ideas and a train of development for that game that has such beautiful potential that is currently being hacked and slashed by a development team that censors more criticism than Nazi Germany in 1942. They repeatedly censor contrusctive feedback from the community, update the game with now useless updates (from the trailer which, of this review, features a new MG for the Americans and a nice nifty pistol for the German infantry to kill themselves with. I honestly have not had enough of that Johnson machine gun. That is a whole different topic that the community would give entire MLA formatted essays about just like the previously mentioned PTRD, auto-carbines, drunk sway motion held iron sights, spawn farming, etc. This game has multiple flaws that Reto-Moto has refused to listen about or fix and the majority of their community is outraged by the fact that the development of this game is coming to lazy standstill with hold off's like a new gun here and there or new camo or maybe a vehicle or two... It's sad to see a great game like this wasted by developers who show us that they're giving up on their game and milking it for whatever pennies it's worth.

Until the latest update that completly ruined the game for me and my friends. As others have stated the game became incredibly grindy and does take a long bloody time time to level up and purchase anything. The game also doesn't reward you very much xp and credits at the end of the game even if you are doing well and win the game. Not to mention the inbalance between the lower tier guns and the higher tiers, specifically the M1/M2 carbine which is the most over-powered gun in the game. That makes the game very pay-to-win and doesn't make the game fun for people who aren't able or willing to spent an incredable amount of money and/or time on this game. Even the purchases with real money cost an absolute fortune. I just hope that they change this current model of theirs and go back to the old Heroes and Generals that made the game so popular. They are really ruining their game and community with the product that they currently have.","August 31, 2015","false","69.2"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","34","57","0","7"

I played it for around 27 hours this week, and that is time im never getting back. Unless you like playing for hours on end without unlocking anything, only being able to buy the starter garbage weapons and jeeps, and like being spawn camped by tanks and snipers all day. The devs of this game is trying so hard to force you to buy your way to power instead of actually playing the game. 0/10 untill the devs start making a real game.\n\nDecided to give the game another go to see if it got better. Spoilers, it didnt. This game gets worse every damn time you play it. the game is full of bugs such a bolt action rifles looking like the they shoot twice so the shot you intended to hit some goes into the next postal code. complete broken spawn system, its also super easy for one person in a heavy tank to spawn camp your entire team. Most battles end in either total stalemates or a massive blitz that smashes one team. At this point it seems like the only thing that actually works in this game is the insanely overpriced store where you can buy yourself all the power in the world (only if you are dumb enough to even give these devs a penny for this joke of a game). I have a really hard time understanding why anyone would ever support the devs or this game what so ever when all they care about it taking your money and clearly not using it to improve the game at all. 4 years of being in "beta" should give you a pretty good idea of how little the devs care about their playerbase.

Finally a World War 2 game which makes you feel like your actually in the war. There is a lot of weapons to choose from and classes which are the Infantry with normal assault rifles such as the M1 GARAND, the Tank Crewman which uses tanks in the battlefield, Paratrooper which comes in from the sky's and gets right in the action, the Recon which uses snipers from a far range from the battlefield, and the General which commands the war in which way to go and who to fight next.\n\nYou can choose which side your on when you start to play, you can choose either the Germans or the Americans.

You can then start to level up your character from there on and unlock new weapons such as the Thomson for the Americans.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/droidiinator/recommended/227940/","droidiinator","Droidiinator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/droidiinator/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFirst of all, this game is probably one of the most pay to win games I have ever seen on steam. you can either pay to unlock all the weapons instantly, or you can chose to spend hours and hours grinding away to unlock 1 item, which will most likely be dissapointing, and have an insanely high repair cost. For example, as the Soviet faction, you get two weapons for free, a basic SMG, and a basic semi automatic rifle. You can chose between the two, however both weapons are very weak compared to the "premium" weapons which you may chose to grind away for, or buy using "gold" which is accquired with real currency (£5 for  around 1,200 gold, which is approximately 1 weapon unlock.... so yeah, definitely not worth it.) The second weapon, which is a bolt action rifle, is unlocked after achieving a certain rifle badge level, which takes a long time to get anyway (ofcourse you may chose the easy way... by paying real money to unlock it instantly) And then you must purchase the weapon for 92,000 coins... yeah, that's right, 92k, for one weapon! That's not to mention all of the upgrade and repair costs, which you will be needing. To put this into perspective, At level 1, your soldier will earn around 8,000 silver/coins per hour, so you will be needing to spend over 11 hours in game, just to unlock your second weapon... And also, it will take a lot longer, as your weapons need repairing, which is also very expensive (around 1,000-5,000 per game, depending on how much you use the gun, and how long the game is, oh and also on the uprades which you have.)\n\nFurthermore, all items/upgrades are insanely over priced, and are practically useless for how much they cost, for example, the improved iron sights, show a different iron sight as the icon, however, when you finally purchase the sight, you will be dissapointed to find that it literally has no effect on the weapons aesthetics, and simply upgrades the weapons precisions. The developer never mentions that the icon in the store doesn't represent the actual in game item, and there is no way to refund it aswell. Also, there are other items, such as a pistol, which costs 72,000 to unlock, yeah, 72k for a f*cking pistol, which does jack sh*t... Same with the binoculars, which cost 32,000, and do nothing but allow you to view enemies at a longer distance.\n\nAnother major flaw of the game, is how repetetive it gets. You'll be spending most of your time grinding to get your favourite item, and the game gets very boring, very quickly. To unlock new classes/carreer options, such as the paratrooper, or pilot, you'll have to spend a long time saving up, and ranking up to get them, meaning that you'll be spending a very long time as infantry, fighting with the same weapons, on the same maps and gamemodes, over, and over again. There is no real variety within the factions aswell, as they all have the same basic guns, but with just different skins and names. Also, each faction has a jeep, motorcycle, and an APC for the infantry, with the only difference being, that the Soviets can carry more people in the jeep, however it comes with no mounted MG.\n\nYet another huge flaw, is the fact that it is virtually impossible to win as the attackers on the war game mode. Defenders sometimes start with as much as 5,000 spawn tickets, tanks, planes, vehicles etc... Whilst the attackers usually have around 800 spawn tickets, limited time, VERY limited vehicle choice, and 1 spawn point, which you guessed it, quickly gets crowded and swamped by the defenders, and the game turns into one giant spawn camp fest. Many of the maps also feature only 1 bridge connecting the two sides, and if the enemy defends the bridge well, then it's game over, as the swimming in this game is very slow, and you are very exposed as your playermodel stands out a lot in the water. But yeah, as I was saying, the game very quickly turns into the defenders over-running the attackers spawn, and just absoloutely destroying them, and with the lack of tanks, planes and other vehicles, the attackers are very weak. I understand that this is meant to simulate real war and battles etc... However it just doesn't suit a game like this at all, as it's literally impossible to progress past the second capture point as the attackers, unless your team is full of high rankers with all the good gear unlocked.\n\nOn the whole, this game isn't too bad (gameplay wise) And it would have a lot of potential, if it wasn't for the greed of the developers, I've also heard rumours that people get banned for silly things such as shooting into the air (which gives you weapon ribbon XP.) This is not stated in the game rules, yet people have been banned for doing this, and the customer support service is shocking, with the response time sometimes being up to 2 weeks... Many of the developers also don't seem to care if you get banned, and reply to your support ticket in a nasty, sarcastic manner (someone mentioned this with proof in a review I think.)","January 11","false","127.6"," 30 of 50 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","30","50","4","9"

I am very conflicted on this review as it has good merits but I am going to give it a thumbs down for a few reasons I will cover now. I will include some of the things I enjoyed as well for those that want both sides of the coin.\n\n- Prices on items are obscenely high and gives uneven advantages to people who pay (essentially Pay 2 Win)\n- The current match making system is extremely flawed after you hit level 5 - I hit level 5 and was immediately thrown into repeated games with people that were almost max rank with Machine Guns, Tanks, Paratroopers, etc. while I was only using a small rifle\n- You can be team killed or team kill by a bicycle bumping you\n- You can run over a rock with a bicycle and commit suicide\n- Players can suicide while driving a vehicle with you in it, causing you to commit suicide and have a long death timer (read below for inconsistency)\n- Players can run into the grenades you throw and in return, give you warning points as well as lost experience/money\n- Vehicles with mounted weapons kill you extremely fast and most of the time from extremely far distances\n- Length from base to objective points will require a vehicle to be of use as a player (bicycle, truck, jeep, etc.)\n- Grenades almost always one shot people even when a decent distance away\n- Disliked the water physics and how it would screw any vehicle that entered water, even if the vehicle was above the waterline\n- Lower graphics than most standard FPS\n- Extremely disliked the repair cost, again trying to force you into paying money\n\nThis is all I can think of currently. Now for the positive aspects.\n\n- Enjoyable as a casual FPS game\n- I found nostalgia in this game, making me miss the old Medal of Honor\n- Good fluid motion and gameplay\n- I loved the effort put into players exiting vehicles, you basically roll out of the car and come up shooting\n- Loved the indicator on the grenade to show where it would go\n- Loved the iron sights and swaying, as well as how the stamina effected the stability\n- I loved the creative addition of the bicycle, it made me laugh to tears when somebody team killed me accidentally while ringing the bike\n- Loved the maps and the creativity put behind it\n- I liked the physics behind vehicles\n\nDue to the demanding aspect of the game that really tries to force you into paying, the poor match making system and (cannot fault the game for this) the lack of players for higher ranked games forcing me into constant red ping, I am going to give this a thumbs down.  If it wasn't for these three aspects, I would love this game and tolerate the other minor aspects.\n\nSorry.","August 9, 2015","false","22.0"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","38","65","0","0"

When someone is in a tank and you don't have a rocket launcher (that doesn't do much damage anyway) there is literally nothing you can do about it unless they poke their head out the top to look around, and that's hoping that you don't get sniped first (snipers are VERY overpowered and take forever to get unless you pay or have 100,000 credits and the requited medals.) Progression in this game is very slow and frustrating becuase of snipers, tanks and having to REPAIR guns and vehicles with real credits in the main menu, if they reach 0% you can't use them. The only time the game is somewhat fun, is when there arn't many tanks and snipes or if you a tank or a sniper or if you have a good tank or sniper.\n\nTLDR:\nTanks and snipers are VERY overpowered\n\n3/10 Terrible\n7/10 if you have good tank or sniper","April 15","false","25.2"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

Now that I saw it on Steam, I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe game improved a lot. Graphics are better, level design looks really good and they improved some of the new maps and added new ones.\nWeapons variety isn't great, but at least they added new ones prior to the Steam release.\n\nOnly problem I have with this game is that the movements feel weird. It's like it has some kind of input lag, keys feel unresponsive. Not sure if it's because the game mechanics, or really an input lag, but as this never improved since closed beta, I believe it's intentional, though I think they should tweak it. I understand when you character runs, it takes some time to stop, as it does in real life, but how it works in game feels really weird.\n\nI recommend the game as I had hours of fun playing it. My favorite part of the game used to be being a pilot and bombing the f* out of tanks. I'll try to play it again just to see what they did to flying.","July 31, 2014","true","0.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

You can easily level up but once you get the modifications for your gun the repair costs will kick in and you won´t make any more money to buy other guns, upgrades, modifications. All your money goes into repair / restock. The only thing that helps is a payed membership.\n\n# False incentives\nThe game forces players to play tactical and go for the capture points / objectives instead of mindlessly killing the enemy. This is actually a good thing but it is badly executed. Quite often players who defend an objective on the outside perimeter do the actual work, helping teammates to capture the point. Especially players with a high K/D do the major effort to secure and hold areas, roads, paths, houses so that the team can progress. Unfortunalty these people fight and die outside the capture zone and do not get the sweet bonus which you really really need to pay for the repair costs.\n\nThis forces you to either play with an unmodded gun to save money or the buy a "veteran membership" which will grant you more bonuses (progression, money, etc...)\n\n# Not a Strategy Game\nDespite this game features a map of europe signaling players that this game is more than just fighting in staged arenas, the truth is, that so many random factors (army composition, loadout, weather, skills) which players can not control leads to a dominance of veteran players with their armies, deep pockets and the newest thing: Squad play which results in random guys fighting a pre-mate group with up to 5 (that´s what i saw, but i bet even more players are possbile) and just destroy them.\n\n# Spawn Camping\nSpawn points are more or less fix and enemy will use it to kill you the second after you spawned. Reto developed some system against it that you are invisible after start but that leads to rediclious situations where enemies spawn behind you or right in front of you.\n\n# Cheaters\nThey do exist even though the people on the forum will tell you that they don´t and that it is all skill.\nWhen people instandly turn 180° because you spawned behind them; when people shoot you half across the map, when the aim of people is switching rapidly, when the players aims at you though he can not see you, because he aimed at someone else and the field of view was so narrow, when they know you are coming through the door and have their crosshair trained on you.... after roughly 20 years of FPS gameplay i know when i see a cheater. This game makes it just harder to detect someone because of the OHK weapons.\n\n# Camping\nThis is a valid tactic but gives you only kills and no objective = points. You might even help your team because you are defending or just killing enemies but the rewards for kills is too low in comparisment to capture points.\n\n# Balance\nWhile real war is not balanced and you might be outgunned against an enemy - in this game you can not even switch the loadout during battle so you are stuck with your rifle but you are fighting on a city map and a submaschine gun is what you need. Or you prepared for CQC but the enemy uses tanks. GG\n\n# Shadows\nA good idea poorly executed. Because of the shadows in this game you can stand 2 meters away from the enemy shooting his MG42 but you won´t the see body only the gun firing. People, cars, tanks, weapons, everything can become invisible in these shadows. It is broad daylight and you won´t see anything because of the difference between shadow and light.\n\nI strongly do not recommend this game!!!\nLike other people said in their reviews. Reto (developer / publisher) does so many unnecessary changes and tweaks to this game to make it feel like a rock hard game and then offering you a membership to ease a few of your problems.\n\nDo not play or buy!","May 26","false","181.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

You don’t see people playing WoW and complaining about spending hundreds of hours to get the highgest level and best gear possible.\nIf you’re not prepared to grind for your levels I suggest you go play Counterstrike (no offense intended, I enjoy that game myself). However if you are interested in a refreshing new take on a WW2 FPS then give this game a go.\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that there are commerce issues, the upkeep of munition and weapons is too high and the price tiering for weapons is too steep. All games have their issues and I strongly believe these will be sorted.\n\nRegardless, I had a huge amount of fun when I started with my GEWEHR 43 and now I have even more with my fully modded Kar98k.","February 8","true","715.9"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

Keep the new premium 5% sharing and PLEASE bring back the ability to join your friends game (This is a HUGE issue) REMOVE the inability to switch squads, any new restrictions, REWORK squad and member ribbons and functionalities so that you don't  need some silly squad points to make a squad of 6.

When I first joined I thought the game was really fun and intresting so I kept playing (I have played for about 500 hours on another account) untill I realised how much of a grind it really is. Badges (The progress system) take forever to unlock so getting new and most importantly good weapons take ages, unless you buy gold like I did.  Not only does it take long time to unlock the equipment, getting the money for them requires the same level of grinding.\n\nNext up is balance and this is a big one. The devs suck at balancing their game. They have more intrest in making good/OP weapons super hard to get for free players but if you pay a huge amount of money you can unlock the badges for that weapon, however than you have to spend more money to buy the bloody gun itself. Anyway back to balance, there is very little. There are two game types, war and staged battles. War battles are controlled by what is going on in the RTS side of the game which sounds cool, but they are extremely unbalanced due to most battles having over welling odds stacked against you like tanks however I can forgive this due to the game trying to make a realistic war setting. Staged battles are the "balanced" side of the game with the amount of tanks, soldiers and planes being the same. However this mod is affected by the unbalanced weapons and tanks in the game, for example a American Hellcat is a tank hunter (That is its tank class) and it is far more deadly than a German Hetzer which is also a tank hunter.\n\nLastly is the maps themselves which are very boring and sometimes pretty unbalanced. As well as this most of the game is just broken. For example the prone mechanics dont work, scoping in when prone often results in the scope spassing which causes you to get killed in most situations.\n\nThe only positives from this game is the concept really.... so sad that devs have become this greedy and lazy.","May 1","false","76.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

I would not recommend a new player start playing now unless they are willing to spend hundreds of hours and/or a good amount of money to unlock the necessary equipments to be competitive. It took me 200-300 hours to level my Soviet up from 0 to 9 without paying any real money (Max level is 22).  If you're good, you can unlock weapons faster, but that doesn’t mean you'll be able to afford them. Unlike XP, salaries are paid out per battle based on your rank and have nothing to do with in game performance. So it doesn't matter if you won the game siglehandedly or were afk the entire time. As long as you complete at least 50 percent of the battle you get paid. On top of that, you also have to pay to maintain your guns, vehicles, explosives, and ammunition. Many times you will be put "over budget" because you utilized to many of the items you worked hard to unlock and pay for, causing you to loose money. I cant use my best gun and anti tank grenades because one has a fast ROF, meaning I have to pay for a ton of bullets. And the other cost an arm and a leg per grenade to the point were if I use more than 2-3 I'll loose money. The devs take every opportunity to milk money from you. It cost money to change classes and then on top of that cost more money to buy the equipment to actually use the class. Noting in the game is balanced well, including the factions. The Germans have by far the best weapons and vehicles, while also having the most highly ranked players. The Soviets on the other hand defiantly have the worst of everything, to the point where they have lost every single war to date. Before the Soviet update, leveling was much quicker, allowing both the Americans and Germans to gain a decent amount of officers and generals. Now, leveling to those ranks in a reasonable amount of time is impossible. The gameplay can be fun when teams are balanced but more often than not one team will be dominant, keeping the other team on the back foot the entire game. Don't even get me started on the weapon balance issues. It's insane in some cases.\n\nIn all, this game has its moments, but those moments are few and far between. I realize the game is free to play and I realize that the devs need to make money. But offering to change vital game mechanics for a fee is one of the worst possible ways to do it. So if your not into mediocre pay to win fps games, I would avoid this one.","June 18, 2015","false","762.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

There are so many concepts which are perfectly painted and so damn simple, but turn out to be buggy, unpolished, pay2win, and a complete grind. This game fills a few of those categories. The painful thing about H&G is that it easily could be great. When alone, the mechanics of this game, including both weapory and gamemodes, are great. Balancing nonwithstanding, if you are a player committed to overcoming the grind and leveling up, you would enjoy this game. But once there are tanks to be fought, unbalanced slugfests of armor running your character over and over again, while you have no acess to anything to remotely damage a single tank, you will lose satisfaction. and at this point in the game's development, it seems like that isnt going to change. It makes me sad, almost angry at modern game companies that grab for cash like this. Again and again, titles such as War of the Roses, War of the Vikings, Rome 2 Total War, Planetside 2, and Heroes (Horrendous) and Generals (Grindfest) show mechanical potential, but disappoint the vocal majority of their players. So I implore you; do not buy into it. do not reward a game company's trechery.","June 9, 2015","false","8.3"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Yes. I will.\nBut what needs to be said is how much of a god damn pisstake this game can be sometimes.\nMicrotransactions left and right and unbalanced as hell weapons.\n\nThere is a huge bias in this game towards factions under the false name of "Historical accuracy" Which is absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. The soviets have so much god damn bias it's not even funny. They cry when the pps gets nerfed whilst having 2 smg's with 71 shots each, compared to the american 30-30 and the german 20-32. People argue "but the guns are balanced with sway and recoil". There has not been one soviet gun i have shot which has had terrible recoil. All of it is managable and a complete joke. I can't take it seriously anymore.  For any new players. That's 71 shots in an SMG compared to 50 shots in an LMG.\n\nAlso worth mentioning, The soviet SMG'S are the kings of hipfire, rendering recoil basically useless, with mods being added to allow better accuracy.\n\nThis game will seriously test your patience compared to other shooters, And as anybody in most teamspeaks will say they have raged more than once playing h&g.\n\nIn terms of atmosphere and graphics, the game is poorly optimised and the only way to set it to minimal quality is to go into game files, which is very risky. The general appearance of the game is very grayscale and dark. making it very easy to hide in stupid spots and remain in the complete dark.\n\nIt is worth mentioning the good things of the game however:\n\nThere is a very active playerbase, with wars being hosted every 15-ish days and lots of people to meet and talk to.\n\nThis game does have some very badass moments, whether it be in a tank, plane or on the ground, This game can make you feel like an FPS god.\n\nThe RTS part of the game is also very fun, while being able to coordinate in a teamspeak or in the faction chat to where you will move your units.\n\nOverall, There's alot to say about this game, which can't be covered in the same paragraph, I understand people will disagree with this but this is just my opinion, so take it with a grain of salt. I've not covered nearly enough as i could have but this is all i can really be bothered to do, Peace.\n","May 8","false","220.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","20"

But I feel like the Devs are to unmindful. Their players are upset because of the slaughtering effect the Soviet side brings. I'm a player myself, I feel that a 12 day wining streak in terms of the wars is a bit unfair. Half of the wars ive seen have been lost in a matter of hours. The soviets are to powerful and the game over all is very laggy. I feel they should let players know that a good computer is needed for this game. But the massive feature that is holding this game from booming is the rage. There is spawncamping, Grenade spammers, Roadkillers and Tank Trapers. Overall I think this game is VERY rageful and should not be played by little kids.","November 2, 2015","false","248.2"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","1"

Repair these mods with in-game credits\nChoose your faction and tell your friends because even though the teams aren't permanent (they re-set every week) you are locked into your faction choice until the war is over.\n\nCons:\nCan be very laggy if you are placed in a foreign server\nMaps are massive and if you have no transport it takes ages to get anywhere\nGood weapons are expensive and may take several days to aquire if you are short on play time\nCan be very buggy as it is in Beta\nIf you are up against an enemy team with Tank classes and you don't have any then the game becomes extremely unbalanced and one-sided.\nThere is a "griefing" system where if anyone does even 1 team damage to you, you can press F1 to automatically report them. Sensative ♥♥♥♥♥es report everyone for everything resulting in bans.\nYou can wait for up to 10 minutes just to get a game only to have it load and inform you that you have to quit.\nThe weapons and equipment you buy with the credits you earn free via playing are extremely expensive. Example; the American BAR 1918 costs 128700 credits. A rank 3 player earns under 2,000 credits for playing a game. Games can last up to 30 minutes or more. It takes a VERY long time to unlock anything useful without spending real money.\nPay 2 Win\nTanks/Snipers beat everything\nVery basic tutorial that teaches you how to shoot.... that's it. No menu/classes/progression tutorials\nTotally unnanounced server maintenance that occurs often in-game, resulting in 0 experience or in some cases losing experience.\nIf your Assault Team runs out of "lives" then you are forced to quit the game, like so:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=292449984\n\nOk we got 9 pros and 13 cons.\nThis game isn't bad, it's just unbalanced and not that user friendly. It is in Beta though so there's room for improvement. A lot of improvement. It's basically WW2 version of Planetside 2, but with mini-battles rather than one constant one. It's really fun but can be very unbalanced if one team has more tanks/air-craft or players.\nI do recommend it because it's free, so you can't really lose. However be aware it may not be a smooth game experience until you get into the swing of how things work. After a few more updates and general balancing this game will be very highly recommended.\n\nEDIT 28/07/14\nThis video gives an extremely accurate representation of the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCVj4CUjDug","July 21, 2014","false","13.8"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","7"

Expect many one-sided games, gameplay that consists of running and wondering where you are, and a lack of any weaponry that can actually kill someone accurately (the higher-level guns will instantly kill you btw). Don't get me wrong, this game was kindof fun at first, but as you progress you....lose the ability to progress unless you buy up.

You have a series of progressively increasing maps that are decently sized and at first glance, look like they provide enough cover... Nothing could be further from the truth. The bigger the map gets, the bigger wasteland it becomes. At the end, at the biggest maps, you might as well be figting in Saudi Arabias Deserts with pine trees scattered throughout. No cover, no damage at any reasonable range by your weapons (even with a scope), a building here and then 500 meters later a building there, the checkpoints always in the middle of a bloody wasteland that you can't traverse without vehicles that arrent available anywhere, checkpoints that are a total of 5 meters squared and bombs that are damage 314 meters squared (10 m damage radius).\n\nIt would be a sad excuse to call people that made this game developers. It would be a lie. They have no clue what they are doing, the only decent decision they made in the whole game is to enable headshots for the rifles from most reasonable ranges. Everything rest in this (formerly) p2w game (but still effectively p2w in many respects due to the completely broken game mechanics) that had it's free cash per hour increased 4x times yet still being too slow to grind is more or less awfull.\n\nSo much promise, soooo little delivered in the end, like the vast majority of todays cookie cutter games. Saddest part about all of this is just how little it takes to fix more or less every issue i have with this game (just tweaking the damage settings so it stops being unbalanced (and a slight p2w) and tweaking the stupid maps so they stop being wastelands, i could manage the grind).\n\nA fail of a game whose only decent mode is depo (the first and smallest map).

Got really annoyed after about 3 weeks - 2 months of playing it and decided it wasn't worth my time. Came back to the game hoping it might be different, only to realize its even more money driven than before.\n\nIf you want my honest opinion. Don't bother. You'll probably drop a significant amount of money (excess of $20) to get anything good or fun. And by that point you mine as well have bought a different game cause the graphics and play experience aren't worth any dollar amount (in my opinion).\n\nFor that reason have to give the game a\n\n2/10\n\nReasons:\n-Developers aren't interested in gameplay (you have to buy bullets with your hard earned in game points or gold (bought with actual money))\n-Gameplay is medicore for a FPS (Red Orchistra or almost anything else looks cooler)\n-Time required to earn anything is too much for the grind to be fun (and someone else could just drop money and beat you there)\n-Having better equipment is a HUGE advantage...\n\nIf you're looking for a good WW2 game, get Comapny of Heroes 2 or something.

I played this game right when it came out and was available on steam there were so many hackers on this game going 40-0 every shot was a headshot, it's gotten a little better since beta but come on if your going to sell an active membership make it fair make it so people can actually think they didn't just waste 20 bucks and I did. they make it to where you can only carry one rifle but you can't carry a sidearm unless your veteran, you can't change your loadout in game REALLY? you have to leave the game and the squad your in to change your loadout you don't know what map your going to play you don't know what loadout you will need till the game starts. another thing that is really stupid is the game timer when you die the timer makes you wait so freakin long to come back into the game by the time you do come back your entire squad is dead. like I said I have been playing this game for quite a long time this last update they had just screwed everything up and the grinding you have to do to get anywhere is not worth the trouble you have to go through to make this a fun and enjoyable game.

I played this game right when it came out and was available on steam there were so many hackers on this game going 40-0 every shot was a headshot, it's gotten a little better since beta but come on if your going to sell an active membership make it fair make it so people can actually think they didn't just waste 20 bucks and I did. they make it to where you can only carry one rifle but you can't carry a sidearm unless your veteran, you can't change your loadout in game REALLY? you have to leave the game and the squad your in to change your loadout you don't know what map your going to play you don't know what loadout you will need till the game starts. another thing that is really stupid is the game timer when you die the timer makes you wait so freakin long to come back into the game by the time you do come back your entire squad is dead. like I said I have been playing this game for quite a long time this last update they had just screwed everything up and the grinding you have to do to get anywhere is not worth the trouble you have to go through to make this a fun and enjoyable game. I have a really good computer so I know it's not my computer messing the game up it's the game messing up because that's how it is. I won't be loading this game up again I will be uninstalling it and never looking back at it.

It's just an excuse at this point. Important items such as a wrench to repair your vehicle are locked behind an extreme pay wall which of course you can bypass entirely by paying real money.

First of all, i paid 30$ for a recon soldier and i was expecting some equipement but NOPE. the sniper was completly stock except for the scope. So i needed to shoot 2-3 times one guy in order the kill him.\n\nThe new update:Devyatayev......JESUS CHRIST, the game is awful, the new interface is horrible, their new squad thing which they look to be pround about it is HORRIBLE: before this update, you could change of soldier anytime after dying for example, if you were a infantry and see that there is an enemy tank ripping apart your team, after dying, you could change to be tanker if you had a tanker. I was switching between infantry and recon did have alot of fun until this bloody update.\n\nThis game became terrible after the updates. In an old patch, stock infantry soldiers  had access to grenades, now when you start as an infantry soldier, you have nothing except that stupid rifle. People that wants to to start playing this game has ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE against players that have a bit more experience. Also, the graphics aren't the best and when someone is in the shadow, you can't see him, he's ♥♥♥♥♥ invisible or something and the game mechanics is a joke. And the worst part of this game is the unbalaced factions; like amrican tanks are simply toooooo much OP. This is the end of Heroes and Generals. RIP heores and generals-2016.....

Every other guy has fully upgraded bolt action rifle that kills with single hit in the torso, but you have rifle that sometimes won´t even kill with headshots (if they have badge reducing incoming damage(NO JOKE)). Movement is clumsy, you have to unlock and buy everything for each soldier separately.For example, you have SMG, and your soldier progresses and you buy him a machine gun, you can´t equip another soldier with that SMG even if he have it unlocked, so you are 1 gun lying in storage. Game economics is a joke, you pay for your ammo and weapon/vehicle repairs, and if you are AT soldier, even if you are using own rocket launcher strictly on enemy tanks (no shooting at infantry), you still end up LOOSING money, because what you get for tank kill is not enough to cover the cost of rockets used. They say you can buy almost anything with non promium currency, but that paywall will hold even white walkers. From july 2014 they added 1 faction (USSR) and strategic map (and some gamemodes) is Germans vs USA vs USSR. This game is wrong at many more levels, but you get the idea, so don´t even bother to download that 1,3 GB, or  buy yourself some other game, because here 20 € is not enough for some guns, you might want, and they will even charge silver or gold money for ammo and repairs.","May 29","false","254.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","7"

It's either a blow out or not. The game feels one-sided a lot, not just being on the American side either. Also, these days it's so hard to really even play an MMO. No one communicates anymore, all they do is shout out "YOU'RE A F****ING NOOB BRO" and leave the game. No one has time to meet or work with people b/c they are too busy waiting on the next big game (That they will play for a month and move on) so, really this game feels like all the players do is argue,  B***H and Moan about how bad everyone is.\nPeople don't want to have fun and progress in a game, they just want to log on and be the best and they expect you to be the best too. Anyway, go kill some Germans, blow S**T up and get called a NOOB by a 10 year old being home-schooled by his uncle Tim.

You're given a semi-automatic rifle and a pile of grenades. Seems not bad. The problem comes when you realize that that rifle, being only semi-automatic in a game with such atrocious servers, struggles to hit, and also takes far too many shots to kill. You can, of course, buy an SMG early on, as the game "helpfully" directs you to. At that point, you are the god of CQC, at least until you're flanked by another fine gentleman with an SMG. But then, when you reach level 3, you're thrown into the big boys' servers. There, you get to play with enemy planes, tanks, paratroopers, and snipers. And of course the enemy side always has more of whichever is the most problematic for you. In my case, that turned out to be mainly tanks, with a side of pesky snipers. The tanks are hard to fight. As a foot soldier there is little you can do to start off.\n\nThere is the occasional Panzerfaust (single shot) in a box which can be picked up. On some maps they're nonexistant, on others they're in locations vulnerable to enemy fire. Later on there is a reloadable rocket launcher to unlock, but I can't force myself to play long enough to get enough money for it. Most maps have a lot of open ground, which means tanks can spam from hundreds of meters away, and snipers can pick you off from similar distances.\n\nThe game doesn't have a ping counter on the scoreboard, but I'm sure I'm getting at least 100, maybe 200 ms ping at all times. The deal is also sweetened by the fact that everything that matters is serverside. There have been many, many instances where you shoot a guy and even see the blood spatters, but the server doesn't count it as a hit.\n\nI can't reccomend that you play it at this point. Maybe it'll get better; it's a beta. But after seeing how far it's come in the past two years of beta (not far), I don't hold out much hope.\n\n","August 26, 2014","false","24.0"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

That translates to about 17 hours of in match game time for that new weapon assuming you and your team perform above par and you win every single one of your matches. Not only that but all the parts and ammo you can buy to make your gun perform differently are going to need constant credit infusions to keep working. Don't leave now theres more! All that grind is just for your primary weapon, so you burn maybe 35 - 40 hours to get that gun and all her mods. by then you have already unlocked access to the straight up better version of said gun WHICH IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE.\n\nNow that im done talking about my third job, lets talk about how the game runs.  Graphics got lost in 2005, net code is back there with it as well. The menu, squad, and friends system don't just need work, you flip a coin at launch to see if they even do work.

It's pretty much a fantasy WW2 game.\nNothing makes sense in the game, the hit reg isn't great and devs don't seem to care about players.\nOnly good thing is you can buy pretty much everything by playing the game.\nIn it's current state it's not worth it unless you play US\nDevs/Support don't care about you.\n\nGameplay:\nThe game play is good, it's greatly optimised but it's still in "BETA" but runs well on my old AMD 7870.\nVisually it's not stunning but you don't look around and think eww, it's a big battles WW2 game from a small dev team. What you would expect.\n\nThe guns, are not realistic at all,\nyou can make a M1 carbine shoot faster than a PPSH-41 which is know to be a fast firing SMG, and it does this without really a reduction to accuracy, you can full auto tap fire snipe people.\nThe way the game is partly set in terms of balance is russia is mainly CQB, america is CQB and medium range and germany is only really long range, with the exception of the MG42 which is good at spitting distance when spitting against wind with your eyes shut cause it's inaccurate as hell. which you would expect but the American guns aren't even at their stupid RPMs. Just look at the wiki http://heroesandgenerals.gamepedia.com/Weapons and see for your self.\nThere's no delay from when you exit vehicles or land as a para to when you can shoot, it's pretty much land (at a speed that would break your legs) and instantly shoot.\n\nThen there's the tanks,\nGermany gets ♥♥♥♥ed here as well, they get early war tanks put against mid to late war tanks for light tanks and TDs, mediums get bearable but only if you grind to get the Panther 2 and heavies as they should be are in germany's favour due to them being better and devs not having a foot to stand on if they didn't.\n\nPlanes dominate tanks,\nThey can easily spawn kill them, i've not flown so I can't really comment on how the flight model is but it's somewhere between War Thunder arcade and World of Warplanes from looking at planes flying.\n\nThe Generals/Wars part of the game if quite nice, reminds me of Chromehounds war map from way back.\nIt got an auto resolve feature about a year ago I think that sorted out stupidly unbalanced games (in terms of troop resources) and this part is quite nice, allowing players to control the war.\n\nThe UI could do with some improvements like the Ribbon overview button being more noticeable that it's an actual button.\nIt's quite minimalist in game.\nThere needs to be an option to remove music after you cap a location.\nSometimes there are no gun sounds when people fire.","March 20","false","342.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Everything is grinding from unlocking, buying, upgrading and maintaining weapons/vehicles/badges/classes.\n-They made griding credits a bit easy if you sink 50 - 100 hrs IN MATCHES (thats right not including those match making time) but they really made grinding ribbons hard now but don't worry you can now use credits or gold which you could buy using real money to immediately get upgrades or ribbons you want with prices that is more expensive than the most expensive guns in the game.\n-I will defend the game is not P2W but paying will give you a little edge on someone who is not paying.\n-It is common to encounter a frustrating match (tanks blowing you up 5 secs after you spawn, no one is doing objective, deploy queue because all your teamates are camping because they dont want to be in the deploy queue, getting in a match that is so hopeless you will wonder why did you wait 5 mins so that the game would put you into that match, your class that are using to grind its weapons is not available in the match or run out of spawn, you have 5 dumb pilots and 5 dumb tankers which are basically dead weight)\n-Did you love the trailers of this game like the soviet one? too bad you still need to wait 20 years for that.\n-Not battlefield kind of gameplay. Which means more realistic spawn location and spawn time. Battles in open areas are skirmishes with few assault until attacker gets tired and just camp in their point.\n-Finally if you are not dedicated enough this game is not for you, without paying anything 10 - 50 hr at least would be required for you to get the play of this game and be familiar to all the maps.\n-If you still reading this and interested in the game PRO TIP DO NOT PLAY ON AIRFIELD AS INFANTRY or you might loose interest of this game immediately that map is for tanks and snipers just practice on skirmishes maps for a few hours.","May 3","false","573.8"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Reto-Moto is currently milking players by adding more and more camos/skins and overpowerd weapons/vehicles (that in 90% nobody ever really wanted) to buy (price too high for grinding these).\n\nThe player-developer communication does. not. exist. The development feedback section on forum is filled with detailed suggestions and constructive criticism. All of this is getting ignored by devs. There are almost no developer responses to these posts.

It is your basic "pay to win" formula.  As a free player, you start out with your minimal 1 to 2 weapon combo, and must grind for hours to be able to upgrade to new equipment.   Meanwhile those who opt to pay real money are given access to better gear, faster experience/credit rewards, and an extra badge slot (which basically allows for an extra ability).  I did have fun for the first few hours playing map after map as an infantryman saving up my money to upgrade to a pilot.  Once I reached pilot rank the game took a completely different turn (for the worse) in "dogfighting" mode.  I've played several flight simulators in the last 25 years, and I'll just say that this game needs some work on the flight system.  The controls are simply awful, not to mention there is no tutorial mode for flying.  Being up against "paying" players with superior aircraft, my plane was gunned down numerous times usually in less than 30 seconds.  Turning is almost impossible, and the beginner plane seems to not be able to outrun anything.  After each match your plane suffers damage, which takes credits to repair as well as credits to resupply your ammo.  After several matches as a pilot, I decided the pilot path wasn't for me...but as I tried to go back to my regular infantryman, the game wanted to charge me credits to do that.  This is where I decided to stop playing the game.  I may come back to this game in the future if they further balance the gameplay and decrease the edge the "paying" players have over the "free" players.","July 16, 2014","false","4.8"," 69 of 126 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","69","126","0","0"

First off the game looks great for whatever engine it is running, it is also understandable that the game is in beta/early access and a lot will still be implemented... I am giving this a thumbs down for now since it is far from being finished and the fact that the cons outweight the pros...\n\ntry the game out. im pretty sure you will love it up until you pass level 3 and/or encounter these issues more and more...\n\nPros :\n\nIf you are looking for that WWII feel, one where you and your buddies can feel as if you are part of the inglorious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, or part of the team of FURY then this game will most likely put you on the right path, it has nice maps and i feel they are made nicely and seem pretty balance where no other team will dominate simply because its better for them starting on whatever side of the map they are...  Sadly that is the only Pro for this game so far...\n\nCons:\n\nPAY PAY PAY... although it is possible to get pretty much anything with the ingame currency you will have to force yourself to grind grind and grind some more just to get that upgrade. (note the higher you rank up the more credits you get). like every P2W game anyone with the cash to blow will always out power you. The slow climb to power (weapons and vehicules) will always leave you on a disadvantage...\n\nBalance is so far an EHH factor since 7 out of 10 matches i played one team out number the other with tanks and planes, which results to a quick end game, fastest round i played so far from start to finish was 3 mins.\n\nDont expect to be able to upgrade your weapon like you would in todays FPS games, there is no scope attachments or suppressors, but you can upgrade the triggers, barrels and so on (the little things) YOU ARE STUCK WITH IRON SIGHTS!!!! until you unlock the sniper rifle, which you can get once you reached the RECON class, which is some way away and would take anyone some time to get unless you pay with real money. same goes with the upgrades... You will forced to bus the Veteran pack membership if you want to level up faster which costs 2400 gold that you have to pay for with real money and there is no option to buy that much gold so you are forced to buy more gold than you need, which is about 4700 gold for 19.95 Euros below that it is 2200 gold for 9.95 euros...\n\nThe hit boxes and damage effects is another thing thats messed up at the moment... for example i snuck up behind a tank to place these Anti Tank grenades on it, for some reason the gunner saw me, how? i dont know since the pilot and gunner have a very minimal point of view (dont think Battlefield when i say limited i mean you can look a few degrees to the left and right, and see next to nothing since the scopes you look through is way to dark, makes you wish for night vision) anyway then the gunner jumps out and starts shooting at me, at this point i already places the ATG on him so i ran for cover, as i reach my cover i turn around to see the gunner standing right next to the tank and i watch the tank explode in a massive explosion and i watched the gunner just stand there in the brunt of the explosion with not a care in the world and just kills me with one shot (note i had full health)...\n\nDamage, like ive mention above this seems to be off by i dont know how many factors, forget the invinsible tank gunner for a second and lets go to the weapon damage, you start with the standard rilfes of each faction, The US using the M1Grand, Germany  Gewher 43 and the Russians the SVT40... then you get a sniper riles one unscoped and one with a scope (scoped can only be purcashed once you reach RECON CLASS or with REAL MONEY). now damage can be upgraded by upgrading your weapon like the Trigger, Barrel, Sights, Ammo and Internals which is the bolt or spring...\nI have the russian sniper rifle which is the Mosin-Nagant 1891 upgraded for maximum damage and for some reason it still take more than 2 shots most of the time to kill someone, which others seem to be getting one hit kills by shooting you on the leg while you have full HP... Could be hacks or could be there is something that i am missing? who knows..\n\nObjects have rough edges there are countless times where i find my weapon aimed perfectly at someone and clearly nothing in the way of my weapon and ones i shoot POOF invisible wall saves his life...\n\nExample i saw a guy proning about 50 meters from me. which is an easy kill, he was looking my way but was busy shooting at someone else, i had a perfcet shot on his head since he was proned and it was the only thing i could see of his body, so i lined up my shot places my sights right on his head and took the shot, and of course invisible wall saves his life. so i line up again to take another shot since he didnt see me yet. i fired, and yup you guessed it invisible wall again, so i move a little to the left *note he is on higher ground so all i can see is his head and it is the only thing i can hit, so standing a little to the left now i took another shot at his head, but instead of killing him (with my maxed out damage upgraded scopeless sniper rifle) all it did was damage him even though i had a pefect shot at his head). He saw me as a result of this shot so i take cover behind a boulder and started to reload my weapon the all of a sudden bang i get hit with a headshot, so im like F**k someone was behind me. buuuut noooo it was the same guy according to the killcam... and this has happened a bunch of time on different matches and maps... latency issues? hacks? unsmooth edges? who knows...\n\nThere have been an extreme amout of BS deaths that just makes you stop and wonder like WTF HOW? but then you just stop and think the game is still in BETA and there will be issues, but once it happens often you just stop and think ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!!! the game is still good though if you have friends to play it with, i wont recommend it if you want to play it alone at the state it is now, you will just spend most of your time wondering how the F**K did he manage to kill me like that or how the F**k did i manage to do that...\n\nJumping in the game is also broken, most of the time the command does not even respond and when it does you will feel as if you are playing Counter Strike with gravity off, you jump high and it takes you a while to get back down, ive gotten a bunch of kills like this, it makes for easy targets...\n\nMatch Making is also another headache, which results in unbalance like mention above. if you make a squad you are stuck on the squad page, so everytime you want to make a change or an upgrade you will have to leave the squad and make your changes and get reinvited back in... a pain in the ♥♥♥ if you are the squad leader...\n\nIf you leave a game you have a lock out of a few mins from the looks of it, kind of like in NOSGOTH...\n\nAll in all the game is good aside for these things which kills the fun to be honest but the game is still Beta and i will stick around to see the finished product, but for now it gets a thumbs down until these issues are resolved.\n\nIncluding the unbalance, this game is reall really really bad when it comes to balance, there are no words for how unbalanced this game it... i fly Russia, and ive never been in a single round where there were more than 3 pilots on my side, worst balance i ever had was 3 pilots vs 11... 11!!! like is i said, there is no balance in this game, one side will always out number you with tanks and planes!!!!\n\nTo sum it all this is like playing Day Of Defeat/Battlefield... only it is unbalanced because of the P2W factor and because of the issues ive mentioned.","April 18, 2015","false","54.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","0"

That's about all the good stuff I have to say about this game.\n\nEverything that can be bought in game (and I mean EVERYTHING) is absurdly expensive, most of the maps are god awful, the battles are majorly unbalanced and I have noticed the odd issue with net code (almost as bad as it is in Battlefield 4, but not quite).\n\nSo, imagine this. You join a battle, but the enemy team has tanks. Well you can just get your own tank right? Nope, once unlocking that it costs over 20k credits to get the basic tank, and that doesn't even have a cannon. So, just give your soldier an AT weapon? Nope, again, it costs a ridiculous amount of credits.\nSo quite often you end up going against heavy armour and cant do anything else about it. Sure you get the odd AT weapon that spawns on the map, but they spawn in the most stupid places, like out in the open for example.\n\nMost of the maps are so open it's not even funny. They all seem to favour either snipers or vehicles, which you'll be grinding for hours and hours before you get either one of them, oh my bad, you can always pay REAL MONEY to get them early.\n\nSo if you can get past the crappy maps and the unbalanced teams, there's the people who have actually paid into the game. You then have to deal with people with one shot kill weapons, better vehicles and a certain badge that gives you more HP. There's probably a lot more stuff you can buy to **** over people who aren't dim-witted enough to give this piece of trash they call a game any money, but honestly I gave up at that point.\n\nConclusion:\nDon't bother with this unless you like unbalanced games and having to pay real money to get anywhere or having to pay to have fun. Like BrazillianSoldier said in his review (http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brazilian_Soldier/recommended/227940/), buy Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2. It's very similar to this, only you pay for it once and you have the whole game, no having to deal with and damn pay to win crap.","July 27, 2014","false","10.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Even for a Beta, this game is quite broken. Though Gameplay is the only one that isn't broken to my knowledge, but it's the loading, the buffering, the waiting, it's too long. I mean, I expected this to be basically Planetside but in a WWII Era, instead I get a Battlefield Free to Play. Though I'm not arguing on that subject, I actually don't mind in the slightest. But the fact that I had to wait nearly 15 minutes just to get to the main menu and an additional 5 minutes to get into a game, I rather just update Planetside 2 and play that. And after the game was done, I got to the point where I could unlock / buy weapons, and that broken too, everytime I buy a weapon it doesn't respond, I keep clicking and I never unlock the weapon. Again, I can reason it being a Beta, I should expect some issues, but this has been out since July and it's nearing the end of August, I think there should of been plenty of time for this to not be an issue for future players like me. I want to enjoy this game, but with the waiting and the non-response of the menu, I can't exactly say I'm impressed nor makes me want to come back. What's the point in waiting nearly half an hour to play one game when there are other games like it that are not only polished but finished to where it can take me just mere seconds to play a game. Maybe when it's "officially released" I may come back to see if it's been improved, but after tonight, I'm more likely not coming back.","August 27, 2014","false","0.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

But as more players with more experience than me in the game appeard it became less enjoyable. The level of fairness dropped dramatically for they were using IRL money to buy IG money allowing them to get expensive upgrades. I could not do this for one of my parents was unemployed so we did not have the money to do that. So i decided i would work hard and earn the IG money and buy what i wanted. But as i finished games i saw that the amount of money u get is miniscule while everything u could want to buy which is major in price. SO in the money category this game fails. The maps are also set up in a way were there is no CQB area it is mostly open fields. Making it impossible to do anything but die as a Submachine gun class which i am. I also played a recent game of assault in which we the attackers had all the objectives ut one. this one was surrounded by vast openess while it had excellent cover. So the losing teamwas able to just sit there and snipe us while we tried to get close. In the end my team which had all but one objective lost because we ran out of lives. The gamemodes all and all make no sense and is basically CoD team deathmatch.

This is what happend to me. Considering the fact that you have to capture flags isn't realistic at all. But this isn't about realism.\nThose type of moments where the enemy comes into a house with 3 or 4 people and youre the last survivor who must defend it are just great and satisfying. Although it sometimes ends up into grenade spam, where everyone throws their grenades in your room. But to be honest this doesn't bother me too much.\n\nIm going to split this into two parts: Pros and Cons. I will also talk about the different aspects about Heroes and generals: Audio/Atmosphere, Gameplay and Graphics.\n\n\nGraphics\nThere's not really much to say. The graphics are just average. Nothing special but it fits to the game. They could improve a bit but honestly im already fine with the graphics. The weapon and car graphics are the best graphics in the game so far. The soldiers all look the same. There's no variety between Soldier A and Soldier B except for the tankcrew or the paratroopers for example but all of them have the same faces. Its not clone wars.\n\nAudio/Atmosphere\nThe Gunshots are really great! I mean they are just perfect compared to other games like CS:GO. On the other hand the distant Gunfire shots are horrible at Mid-Range. If someone shots a rifle 40 meters away from you, you will hear it. In this game, you wont. At least its not so easy. I cant really say much about the Tanks because i played this game for 9 hours. So bare in mind that this is an early review.\nIf no one is shooting or driving you can hear absolutely nothing. There is no wind or Animal sounds. Just nothing.\nIn the games menu where you can customize your soldiers you will hear the games Soundtrack over and over again, which can be annoying.\n\nGameplay\nLike i said Above the fights are just intense and satisfying. The game itself is very easy for me because i already have a KD of 1.85 after 9 hours of playing. If you are new to the game the objectives are pretty easy: Capture the flag. Just like in WW2.\nThere are microstransaction in Heroes & Generals but it doesnt affect the gameplay. At least not for low-level battles. The matchmaker is pretty good in this game but sometimes you have to wait 90 seconds till the battle starts.\nLet's get to the "Campaign map". Yes the campaign map you got me. Heroes & Generals is also a strategy game.\nThe map itself is europe with every single city on it. But i completely ignored it at the start because for low levels like me this map is totally useless because you have to be a Corporal to fight on it. Anyways Generals or Lieutenants can start battle on it and YOU as a soldier can fight on these battles! Want to fight on the battle of Berlin? You can do it, if youre level 5.\n\nPros\n+ Very good Battles itself\n+ Immersive\n+ One of the best Gunshots sounds ever\n+ Capture the flag: Just like in WW2\n+ Very easy to learn.\n+ Customizable Soldiers/Weapons/Appearance\n+ RTS Elements\n\nCons\n- No Atmosphere if nobody is shooting\n- Battle may turn into Grenade Spam\n- Only a few Maps\n- Distant Gunfire is Awful\n- No Variety between Soldiers\n- The Map design is really wierd sometimes\n\nMy personal Verdict:        7,5/10\nIt's a great game and theres literally no reason to not download it because its free!\nPS: Don't hate me for my Grammar.\nPSPS: Thanks for reading this review :D Youre awesome\n","July 29, 2015","true","33.8"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","56","43","77","9","8"

Those videos are made to look way way better than what you actually get when you play the game. The graphics in the game are decent, but they could be better. The tanks, cars, and guns are done pretty well as they show a good and accurate amount of detail to what they really were in WW2. The soliders and maps are where things start to decline. The maps in this game all have the same sort of greyish - brown texture. The trees could have been done much better, as they look like 2x4s painted grey and the bushes look like poor cutouts of a pre-schooler. The soilders aren't the best either. The character model is the same for everyone across all three of the factions. All of the models have the same creepy, face that stares at you and that doesn't change even after being shot in the back of the head. But, to help their poor character models, they added different types of camos in the game so you can stand out yet blend into the map as you go into battle. The only problem is, that the camos are $$$, which leads me into my next point.\n\nThis game is free to play, which usually translates into pay to win. Not always, but usually. Unfortuantly, this game is 100% pay to win. Unless you have FPS experience in the past, you will have a very hard time starting off with the first guns they give you. Even after you have been playing the game for awhile or are used to playing FPS games, they are rather hard aim with. Each of the starter rifles for the 3 factions are the same in many ways, Each hold limited about of ammo, each have slow rate of fire,  and each have poor iron sights. This will make it very hard for players to be able to enjoy the game at first, and get credits ( ingame currency ) to get better weapons. But, after 1-2 days on the game, you get enough credits and buy a new weapon and you go try it out ingame. When you finish, you come back to being in DEBT becaus your weapon needs repairs. Repairs in this game are COMPLETLY unnecessary and a way for the game to suck away your money. The idea is that you need to repair your weapon after battle, but that idea  sucks money away from you very quickly. But, you still like this game, so you get past it and keep playing the game. You spend some time on the game and find yourself with a new weapon, and at the same time find yourself not being able to make credits. This is where the veteran membership comes in. The veteran membership is a small buff  that makes you level things up quicker, rank up faster and gain more credits. If you want to make a very good amout of credits in a day, you will need to have your accout a veteran member. All the rest you will figure out very fast. The badges, weapons, cars, and tanks in the game take a very large about of playtime to unlock, ( unless you buy gold ). So... the game is a grind, it doesn't look the best, and is pay to win, but its fun right?\n\nThe gameplay of the game is one of the few things that is good about it. I have had a very good time playing this game, but there are still things that need to be fixed. First, the movment. For a long time, moving in this game has felt very floaty. There was a recent patch to fix this, but there are still times where it feels you are on iceskates trying to turn a corner before you get killed. The shooting in the game is good. Its a classic aim down the sights and shoot game,, but you will need to do one thing, which is get a basic understanding of the maps. As said very breifly before in this review, these maps are WAY to big. Its not quite at the point to where its an open world game, but its like CODs NukeTown times 100.\n\nThere are still many things that need to be inproved about this game. In the end it depends on who you are. If you know the basic FPS lingo, give the game a shot.

But after a few updates, it died shortly after.  The fact that you have to play for hours upon end to actually get any good weapons or any interesting classes kills the mood for me.

He was very happy with his game, so he first released its alpha version soon followed by its beta version and steam launch, still fully bugged, with an ancient graphic and with unstable servers, but with a beautiful idea of the ultimative WW2-game, close to perfection. And he decided that he will work on this game hard, releasing patches and bugfixes every month, so his game could become beautiful and some day go out of beta and become playable, finally a good and a well balanced game. But.... the dark times have come. The developer becomes sick on mind - the bad and the ugly ones tell he becomes greedy. His sickness drowned him into darkness, and he was no longer the same. He forgot about his creation, leaving it on a cold stone deep in the mountain cave. The game, lying on the stone, cried for a first time, and all people who put their hopes in it cried with it.\n\nThe time have passed, world has changed, mordor faded away long time ago and everybody forgot about the game. The developer grew old, probably died or hidden somewhere in the great forest, in fact nobody knows. The game itself is now lost, noone cared about it for a long time, and it lays in ruin, being slowly consumed by the sickness of its creator. The legend says that some day someone will find that cave, take out the game to the daylight, fix it from the bugs that are poisoning it and flooding its veins, and the people will give their hearts to Heroes & Generals once again.\n\nBut, that's only a legend....\n\n\n_________________\n\n\nFinally I love this game.","February 10","true","049.6"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","13","20","6","1"

And the fact that the devs are pretty slow at their job. It is still a pretty good game. Don't get discouraged by the grind, I have a Recon with a OHK k98 and never payed a single dollar. Granted it did take me about 3 years of on off playing, but now I have one, and a fighter pilot AND a tanker with the Panzer IV. Once you get all that stuff, you can laugh at the other people who paid money and just started with the same gear it took you 3 years to get. And on to the axis, allies and soviet thing. I have never played a single second as anything but Axis. Axis stuff is not OP! We get the best tank(how often do you see heavy tanks in a game?) and thats about it. Everything else is pretty balanced. The allies get the E8 which was a heavy tank irl, and it steamrolls Axis medium tanks. Every game I play, the thing that says we win or not is teamwork. Without teamwork games suck and we get steamrolled. From what I see on the Axis side, is that very rarely does the other team work as a group. When they do work as a group however, the game is fun and can go to either side. Yes there are way too many people on Axis. But when I joined the last war, there were only about 50 less players on the allied side then Axis, and the soviets had around 200 to 300 less than Axis. Could be because nobody really wants to start from scratch on the soviet side, or because teamwork doesnt exist. I will say its probably a combination of the two. and for my final overview. Axis, Allies and Soviets are all about equal. It is not a P2W all that does is make the grinding time faster. OHK guns exist on all sides. All in all its a fun game and you should get it.

It has its flaws and it has its  good sides.\n\nThe good\n\n- It is a really fun game to play with friends.\n- Maybe the best ww2 fps in a long while. ( it is a shame there arent that many of those)\n- The mix of vehicles in the game ( Could need some balancing but not that much)\n- The ability to modify your guns the way you want.\n-  Shooting in the game in general is just fabulous, u actually have to think abit where you shoot and when you shoot. not just spray mindlesly like in normal fps games where the bullets go exactly there where you aim.\n- You dont unlock everthing in the game the instant you start it, you actually need to play it to get the guns you want. ( The minus side of the thing is you can buy them with real money but hey, the devs need to get their money somehow from this awesome game)\n\nThe bad.\n\n- It has a lot of bugs. ALOT\n- There is abit too much server downtime.\n- The guns between allied and axis are bit too unbalanced\n- There should be a tank limit in the game. ( Too many people just wanna go to tank for easy frags because no1 bothers to destroy them when its really easy)\n- The matchmaking should be more reasonable with the squads there are on each side. There is no point when the other side has 20 tank squads and other one has just infantry.\n-  The squad system is really bad. You cant play with your friends if they want to  be a paratrooper / tankman / recon / pilot unless you make a new infantry character.\n- The matchmaking should not put Rank 14 vs Rank 1. There is just no point this should be balanced somehow.\n- The chat doesnt work, atleast not for me.\n- The maps repeat themselfs alot.. Hoping there will be alot of new maps when this things gets actually released.\n- Too many people leave the game too early and then you are just stuck in a deploy queue, which is stupid that you get punished for the other team meambers for leaving. This should be changed somehow. A big penalty for leaving  or a big reward for playing the game to the end.\n-  The generals side of the game is just pointles. Delete that and focus your time on the actual game and make it work better\n- The game fps is way too low for how it looks.\n- The point system is abit stupid. Specially the capture when only the first one gets the 28 poins and others 13. This should be the same for everyone. Or the points come from the time spent on capturing.  You should get alot of more points when destroying tanks with bazookas / nades.  The points from headshots should be abit more. Tho this is not nessesary.\n- Community whining that it is Pay to win, when it clearly is not.\n\nI would recommend this game for everyone who likes WW2 games and more of an simulator fps than an arcade fps.\n\nThese were just a few things that popped in to my head while writing this review. If you have some toughts or ideas you would want to share. just write them in to the comments. This is how i think about the game. It has a very good future if the dev team just keeps working on it and keeps making it better and better.

If you don’t mind a slight grind in the beginning until you find your favorite play style this game will find you dumping many hours into it. Many people complain about how it is pay to play which is untrue. It does take a while to unlock certain weapons. Though they do add a little advantage when you get them it is not so much that a good player can’t still be a killing machine with only the starting weapons. The vehicles do require maintenance but once you’re able to afford a vehicle your rank and pay are more than able to cover it without even really noticing unless you’re just wasting resources.

Just get Red Orchestra 2.\n\nThis game is bloody infuriating. More often than not, you get killed out of nowhere by some prick with better gear and the killcams are worse than useless. Tanks are horribly overpowered, in fact you are all but dead if faced with any kind of armoured vehicle. Anti tank weaponry is nigh on impossible to find, maybe 10 Panzerfausts are across a large map. You can buy anti tank weaponry for your soldier (eg Bazooka, Panzerschrek) but it's extremely expensive. That brings me onto my next point that you accumalate currency far too slowly. It took me 15 hours to afford a bolt action rifle for gods sake! Of course you can pay to unlock this gear. You can also pay to get "Academy trained" soldiers, which effectively means that for money you can skip most of the progression altogether. Buying an academy trained recon gives you a one shot sniper rifle straight out of the gate.\nAlso, it is seemingly random as to whether you hear gunshots. I got shot three times with a C96 and heard none of the shots. The russian side is far superior to the other 2 in the early game. Their default rifle (SVT-40) is OP and their first SMG is a 70 round death machine.\nYou can have some fun though. Getting kills is so difficult that everytime you get one it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ triumph.\nA good concept poorly excecuted. Pay to win, buggy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which serves only to empty your wallet. Don't play this if you aren't ready to get very angry or ready to pay through the nose for your fun.

Thanks to my experience in this game, i was able to see the downfall of it. At the beginings i was amaze what a nice idea it had, the whole leveling system and the complexity of the War map. The handling of assault teams and so on. And still the general mode is awsome and is becoming more and more awsome. But, on the the other hand, the whole action game is a gorrific abomination.... the engine is broken, even the devs coulnd decide if its more like a real or arcade type of shooting and they created some terrible mixture of it, where basically nothing works. In the action game you get only frustrated, the rewarding system is so imbalanced, it doents even worth shooting an enemy, you get nothing for that, the only way to get experience is charging forward and hoping you can participate in the capturing of a point.  There are also problems with moving your character because of the "momentum system" which is kind of a failure from the devs. (arcade or real?)\n\nAll in all, the general side of the game is awsome with many tactical options, but the FPS is so bad, you actually get to hate this game before you can play on the great map.\n\nGreat idea, bad actualization.

The graphics do not help much either (once again, do not be fooled by brushed up screenshots, the game doesn't pack much as it is a relatively small game).

Don't get me wrong, the first few hours of this felt so, soo good. After I reached level 3, things really turned to ♥♥♥♥. Let me explain a bit. The game starts you off fairly simple, you got a gun and a grenade (no sidearm for some odd reason) and you play some small CP maps, battlefield style. All is good, shooting is ok I guess, everyone has the basic gear it all goes down to who is the better fps player. After you reach level 3 you can unlock "war" and some other maps, playing these huge maps at first felt like a thrill, huge opened up areas with plenty of flanking and sniper positions. OK. All is good, then things start to go down the toilet. What started as a promising shooter, turns out to be one of the most unbalanced shooters I've played so far. First off, the teams are never equally matched, players of different skill are placed at random, so you can either have a fair experience, or you're gonna get rekt time after time. This also evolves into a second major flaw, the unlock system. I have never for the life of my ever explained why I need to grind my way just so I don't feel under powered or to feel like I'm missing out, and I will never see the point. My gripe here is that the enemy team has 6 tanks, about 6 snipers and infantry with OP as ♥♥♥♥ guns that completely destroy you at close range, while you are stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bolt action rifle that takes up to 3-4 hits just to bring down a dude. ♥♥♥♥ it, I'm not playing this game ever again. Blocking content, especially game changing ones is not fair. I don't give a damn if this game is 10 bucks or of it is free, it is never ok to lock content away, ever. This is one of the worst business models in videogames ever. PERIOD. Too bad, this is a game with such potential but nope, they will never drop the pricing of items. They even have the balls to lock away "bonus xp" behind some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t paywall, at least don't tease people with experience, you have to grind hundreds of hours to get everything in this game, I'm not kidding, and after you're probably grinded your way to the top, who cares? Want my suggestion? Go buy CS:GO, simply the best shooter ever. ♥♥♥♥ this game, and ♥♥♥♥ ww2 games, they can kiss my ♥♥♥♥, go play Counter-Strike to see how a cheap and excellent shooter is made, not this p2w miserable ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe Good:\nNice weapon models\nExpansive - huge battlefields\nOk sound design\nPlenty of combat types - Air combat, tank combat, infantry etc\nLots of contentThe bad:\nPay 2 Win system (Don't defend it)\nLocked content that takes weeks of playing to unlock\nLack of matchmaking balance\nNo voice chat, no radio commands, nothing except text makes playing this game alone a waste of time\nLack of variety in game modes (CTP is the only mode found here)\nOverpowered guns and lack of balance\nTanks are ruining the game\nMediocre shooting mechanics\n\n5/10. Visuals look bad, but I guess it's ok since the levels are huge. Remove all the pay 2 unlock/become overpowered features and maybe this game will fair better, since then, only frustration and bad design choices will be the things you find in this game","May 20, 2015","false","9.5"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","16","26","4","8"

Pretty standard fps controls. Vehichles feel alright for the most part and so does shooting. Couldn't tell you about planes because in spite of spending 175 hrs on the game I have not unlocked the ability to fly them since I don't have infinite money. The main issue with the game is the simply horrible F2P model that makes the game such a chore to play.\n\nIn spite of the near infinite amount of unlockables across all the factions the game has a terrible system for earning in game currency. It is very much a pay 2 win game. Takes ages to unlock most things between the xp requirments to unlock items and the currency cost. There are counteless ways to spend real money to subvert these time constraints including buying better soldiers, buying the weapons/items or buying veterancy status which basically doubles your rate of obtaining xp and money. Most of the costs for anything are really high. Don't expect to unlcok most items without playing countless games per item. Worst of all there is no ability to sell items to get some of your in game money back. Couple this with the fact that you can't test items before buying them unless you are lucky enough to find one on the battlefield this makes for a terrible system.\n\nTLDR don't play this game unless you enjoy wasting money or literally all you want to do is shoot people with the starter rifles.","May 26","false","174.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

My first experience was on a computer that couldnt run the game very well. Even with 20FPS i absolutely loved the game. It was exactly what i was looking for. A fun WWII game that is free but not P2W. I loved this game, a lot.\n\nThe updates have ruined this game. It was a masterpiece when I first joined. The community is so divided because of what the devs have done to the game. They added the M2 Carbine (that no one asked for) and it has divided the community because it has an insane ROF and almost no downsides. They added the cone fire update, which screwed up SMGs. They ruined the StG-44 (which there was a massive hype for). They gave planes these "HE" bullets that make flying VERY boring. You can empty as much ammo as you want into the other plane, but then he shoots you twice (AFTER YOU EMPTIED ALL THOSE BULLETS INTO HIS PLANE) and he kill you. The tank gameplay is broken, the tanks run from the infantry on bikes. It's a joke. The latest update has made the game way too complicated.\n\nThe squad 2.0 was supposed to fix everything, matchmaker, bad pings, unbalanced matches, etc. It has made this stuff worse. Pings are awful, matchmaker is terrible, matches have 3 planes vs no planes (this was supposed to fix it).  The update just came out, but it shouldnt have come out. They have a ton of work they need to do with it still. I have no idea why the update went live.\n\nThere has not been a good update since Walker build. Walker screwed the game and it hasn't had any good updates since. The Walker update introduced scopes for infantry. Now instead of having the sniper (recon) class, we have infantry sniping with 1hk rifles, assault rifles with scopes, and semi autos with scopes. Infantry is a direct upgrade from the sniper (recon) class in almost every way.\n\nI do not recommend playing this game until they have the squad system fixed.\n\n\nI love this game, I want to see it do well, but the devs do not listen to what the community wants. The amount of stuff they added (that no one asked for) that has divided the community is way too high. The forums have become toxic.","May 27","false","458.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Good graphics, good movement mechanics.  Things look and sound like they should and there is a terrific amount of area on a map to explore as well as a variety of ways to develop your heroes.  But then things start going south rapidly.\n\nFirst there is the premium currency trap.  You earn credits in the game based on how long you are playing.  Not how well you do in a given match, not for doing things, just for time in a match.  These credits must later be spent on maintaining your soldier's gear or you can't use them.  You also have to maintain any weapon upgrades.  You also have to maintain any vehicles you used, if any, as well as their upgrades and of course ammunition.  Once all that is done, if you have any credits left over, then you can buy things that your XP has unlocked.\n\nBut Wait!  All this can be avoided if you just open up your wallet and buy premium currency.   Otherwise you are stuck grinding up credits while using the basic gear.  Not because you don't have better but because you can't afford to use better.\n\n\nSecondly, there are ways to set things up so the following will happen.  Player A and Player B round a corner and run into each other.  Player A has an automatic weapon and reacting first immediately fires a burst into the body of Player B.  Player B has a single shot, non-sniper rifle and fires back, hitting Player A in a limb and killing him instantly.  Player B carries on, only lightly damaged by the automatic weapons fire he took.  Player B wins the encounter, not due to superior skill, but rather due to superior use of money to maximize the games badge and perk system.\n\nThirdly, there is the poor balance of the strength of sides in battle formats.  An example:  Side A is defending a point against Side B.  Side B must cross an obstacle and open ground to reach their objectives.   Side A will have fortified positions, pillboxes, AA guns, machine gun nests and armor.  Side B gets....infantry, bicycles, jeeps and if very, very lucky, an apc.  What usually happens is that Side B rushes forward in an attempt to seize positions before Side A can mobilize from spawn.  If they succeed, well and good.  Side B has a fighting chance.  But what usually happens is the Side B gets driven back as Side A rolls over the 'attacker' with armor and wins by capping Side b's spawn points in an irresistable tide.\n\n\n\nH and G could have become a truly, truly great game loved by thousands if not millions.  But the continuous repetition of the above examples and things like them drove people away from what could have been a legendary franchise.\n\n","May 28","false","165.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

The devs do not understand how to balance power between factions, and how to give each army advantages/disadvantages that make the game enjoyable. They have obviously been in a beta state for too long, but that is besides the point. I have purchased the veteran upgrades multiple times, for months at a time, and that seems to be the only way to get an edge on the combat field. People who don't pay to play are not going to get very far. At this point, the game is so unenjoyable that even the grind isn't worth it anymore. Please, take it from me; someone who has spent probably a hundred or more dollars to play a free game. Don't waste your time or money on this game. I admit, it is one of the more developed WWII games, but really. It isn't worth it. I regret all the time I have spent playing this game. New updates only make factions more and more unbalanced.

Once all that is done, if you have any credits left over, then you can buy things that your XP has unlocked.\n\nBut Wait!  All this can be avoided if you just open up your wallet and buy premium currency.   Otherwise you are stuck grinding up credits while using the basic gear.  Not because you don't have better but because you can't afford to use better.\n\n\nSecondly, there are ways to set things up so the following will happen.  Player A and Player B round a corner and run into each other.  Player A has an automatic weapon and reacting first immediately fires a burst into the body of Player B.  Player B has a single shot, non-sniper rifle and fires back, hitting Player A in a limb and killing him instantly.  Player B carries on, only lightly damaged by the automatic weapons fire he took.  Player B wins the encounter, not due to superior skill, but rather due to superior use of money to maximize the games badge and perk system.\n\nThirdly, there is the poor balance of the strength of sides in battle formats.  An example:  Side A is defending a point against Side B.  Side B must cross an obstacle and open ground to reach their objectives.   Side A will have fortified positions, pillboxes, AA guns, machine gun nests and armor.  Side B gets....infantry, bicycles, jeeps and if very, very lucky, an apc.  What usually happens is that Side B rushes forward in an attempt to seize positions before Side A can mobilize from spawn.  If they succeed, well and good.  Side B has a fighting chance.  But what usually happens is the Side B gets driven back as Side A rolls over the 'attacker' with armor and wins by capping Side b's spawn points in an irresistable tide.\n\n\n\nH and G could have become a truly, truly great game loved by thousands if not millions.  But the continuous repetition of the above examples and things like them drove people away from what could have been a legendary franchise.\n\n","May 28","false","165.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

Matchmaking is completely broken. I doubt it was an issue on my side, I can easily find a match in any other game, I have decent internet connection and I don't live in the middle of nowhere. After waiting for 10 minutes, I finally found a match. The only problem is that i went off to go eat and never realized i joined a match so when I came back, I was already being kicked from the game. (and i only left at like 8 minute mark)\n\nSo yeah otherwise I'll just wait untill they fix this issue and maybe come back to it later, This is an early access game and it is f2p so I can't really blame it for anything, yet I am surprised that a game with so many people playing would have such bad matchmaking :P\n\nPS Will change my review once I start finding matches after 5 minutes of searching.....","June 3","false","0.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I only play the game still because there are no refunds. If the devlopers can stop this, i will take back what i said, but if they continue making updates, that eventually players that start the game wont last 1 sceond on the battle field.

Why wasted you ask? Squad 2.0...\n\nWhat's Squad 2.0 you ask? Squad 2.0 was added in the D Heroes Build (25/5/2016). The concept of Squad 2.0 was to make players get closer and get to know each other. Well, why is that a bad thing you ask? Well.. Let's say that Reto spended too damn little time thinking about the way to implement it...\n\nIn Squad 2.0 you can either:\n\nGet 2-6 of your friends to play in a squad. (Which I 100% can't do because gamers are pretty much LONERS +PLUS+ this ♥♥♥♥ is almost dead after the Squad 2.0 ♥♥♥♥ up)\n\nOR\n\nGET IN A BATTLE WITH 2-6 RANDOM PLAYERS IN YOUR SQUAD AND A RANDOM SQUAD LEADER!

Which is a big "♥♥♥♥ you" to veterans and loyal players that have been keeping this game alive and also the reason I said "wasted" hours.\n\nDid I mention Reto is trying to cover up the negative feedback? Reto is deleting posts that complain about the Squad 2.0 and even banning players from the forums.... A gaming company that won't even hear it 's loyal fan base after flipping 'em off and even go as far as to ban 'em from the forums....\n\nMessage to Devs:\n\n1st: Banning negative feedback isn't helping. Infact it 's inraging the players even more after being ♥♥♥♥ed over.\n\n2nd: There's a reason no other company implements such system; and that's fun. This is a game, you morons, NOT ♥♥♥♥ING ONLINE DATING BS! I GIVE NO ♥♥♥♥S ABOUT GETTING TO KNOW MY TEAM MATES! FUN IS THE REASON I AM PLAYING YOUR ♥♥♥♥! I am not here to socialize, games for me and I think for most of us are a way to get away from the reality and have a good time, or fun as you may.\n\n3rd: No company flips off their veterans and loyal players. Your game deserves to ♥♥♥♥ing die for doing that. Those people INVESTED not only TIME but MONEY and kept your game running... even daring to flip them off is a ♥♥♥♥ move...

Sometimes when you're capturing a city you could engage with enemy soldiers in short range, but sometimes when defending or just engaging a city you could see an enemy from far and you take your time to make a clean headshot or just wait for the perfect moment to shoot.\n\nWhy i love this is game is bc you control how you want to play it. Do you like fast paced games, go ahead take a submachine gun and blast the hell out of ppl in the middle of action while capturing or defending. Do you like slow paced games (like me) lie down in the woods and wait till someone goes and captures your city and take him out. Or lie in the forest and help your fellow teammates capturing the city by taking out incoming enemies.\n\nAlso a great thing is that there are tanks, cars, bikes, planes (bombers and fighters), paratroopers, etc. It's just epic to see that your teammate drops a bomb on an enemy tank that is trying to kill you. Or just seeing a friendly tank fighting with an enemy tank and see paratroopersd descending from the sky. I myself haven't played as one of them. I'm still waiting to become recon and buy a sniper rifle to take those guys out from a distance.\n\nIt's kinda pay to win, but if you rank up you get more money with battles, so if you have patience you can achieve a new weapon, vehicle and some modifications in 10 hours of playing.\n\nIt is F2P, just check it out!","July 15, 2014","true","60.8"," 39 of 70 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","39","70","0","7"

The matches are just stupid free for alls were each teammate is a lonewolf. There is no "teamwork", no squads, no voice chat, and text chat is rarley used besides to type ♥♥♥♥♥ a few times in a match. It attempts to be another battlefield, but falls sooo short of it. With awful hit detection and guns that may as well be BB guns, I mean, an M1 takes 4 shots to kill?!!? It fires a damn .30-06 for christs sake, this gun punches so hard, but due to it being free to play you can't have the starting weapon be the best gun in the game. The grinding is expected and i don't mind it, but what pisses me ooff about every single F2P is that it must be pay to win and sucks any further enjoyment out of the game.\n\nI spawn in and immediatley die due every spawn point spawning me out in the ♥♥♥♥ing open! I went into a base and a german spawned in directly behind me while I was capturing the base. Half of the entire team sits in the hills with snipers becuase it is the only way to play the game and enjoy becuase spawning in and dying seconds later isn't enjoyable. The map design is absolutley terrible, the maps are gigantic and it would be nice if it could actually support such big maps with such little ammounts of players. Some maps have up to 12 or so points but sometimes only 24 players on a server. So you run for so long to only be sadly killed by a person with a much better weapon than you. The gamemode that I played had flag points that you'd capture, but you'd have to have a flags captured that was connected to continue on, so once a team begins to lose they're ♥♥♥♥ed. You can't flank and take points  from behind and start an ultimate back rage if your team would even cooperate.\n\nThis game is sadly nothing i expected, with poor everything you'd expect at least realism to make up for something, but nothing in this game makes me feel like im in an actual warzone. The sound design is poor, the music is off, and the game feels sooo fake. Tripwires Red Orchestra 2 was a very good and that game (at least what I played of it on the free weekend) immersed me. The gun play isn't the best and may be a bit clunky at times but I felt like I was in a real war, that I was a Russian fighting for the motherland or a Marine burning out pillboxes with my flamethrower. The settings in that game were so well put together compared to Heroes and Generals.\n\nSo simple enough do NOT download this game, it is a waste of hard drive space.\n\n","January 6, 2015","false","1.8"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","28","49","3","1"

I am criticizing this game objectively without bias, so don't expect me to only bash the game with bad reviews like other popular reviews to satisfy your hatred of the game. I am completely aware this game has a bad reputation on the community due various reasons. So please, read first, rate later. My review consists of:\n1. Pros\n2. Cons\n3. TL;DR\n4. Pay to Win explanation; why so many negative reviews, including mine?\n\n1. Pros\n+ Gameplay is fun. It's the only good WW2 MMOFPS out there with large player base and this kind of gameplay. Would've been better if they are using PlanetSide 2's style, though. But maybe it's protected with copyright.\n+ Moderate scale of battle. Unlike most other 5v5 MMOFPS, Heroes and Generals has a 18v18 map\n+ Good graphics, but not great.\n+ Good shooting system. Snipers will be affected by gravity (but not wind) and they will have to adjust their scope accordingly. Weapons that appears to be blocked by certain object won't be able to hit the target just because the crosshair is on the target. And last but not least, unlike CoD, recoil exists here. In general, shooting system is challenging (especially long range shooting), but the difficulty does not overwhelm the fun.\n+ Various tanks & other land vehicles, planes, even bicycles\n+ Haven't tried the 'Generals' side where you get to deploy troops to win the war, but I heard people said it's pretty good\n+ Weapon choice is limited, but adequate. You won't easily purchase any good weapons without using the bad ones first since there are prerequisite to fulfill before purchasing one. So progress is needed to achieve good weaponry.\n+ Soldier classes, ranks, and other visual progress bar technique to keep you addicted\n+ Three out of 5 WW2 major military power is here (Russia, US, Nazi)\n+ Teamwork heavily determine the outcome of the battle. Individual skills only affect snipers.\n+ Game is being updated frequently with the devs actively streaming on twitch.\n\n2. Cons\n- Reloading animation doesn't make sense. After 2 shots with my Kar98k, the reloading animation shows me putting in 5 bullets. Bullet count always resets to zero when you reload.\n- Clunky & crude animations, makes close quarter combat very awkward\n- One type of plane. No bombers, which is weird. Dive bombers played a big role in WW2.\n- Game stays in Early Alpha for a very long time. Showing that the updates are quite insignificant and devs are only trying to increase the pay-to-win range.\n- No Japanese & British? All major military powers in WW2 would be complete if they add the Japs & the British, maybe they're still working on it (French was also a major one in Allied Forces but they surrendered early)\n- Pay to Win system is very blatant and annoying, complete expalantion on part 4\n- Terrain texture is crude, trees and grass are like from the early 2000s games.\n- Lack of objects on open areas to provide cover and realistic combat, buildings and ruins provides the only covers, which makes it very obvious. Rocks and trees can also be used but it's usually not really effective and not well placed.\n- Despite the fact that teamwork is very important to win the game, majority part of the community are not cooperative nor communicative. But this is not completely their fault, the devs are guilty too, here. More about this will be written on part 4.\n\n3. TL;DR\nGreat gameplay, pay to win is annoying, challenging shooting system, one of the best WW2 MMOFPS out there with large player base, land vehicles, planes & infantry battle, grinding is almost pointless due to expensive weapons, imperious & immature moderators that are capable to ban you (rare occurance). Point is, if you're not ready to spend money on this game, don't waste your time grinding. If you are really into WW2 MMOFPS, this game is worth trying.\n\n4. Pay to Win analysis & Why so many negative reviews\nThis is the main reason the community keep bashing Heroes & Generals with bad reviews, completely ignoring the good side of the game and creating a negative-only review, reinforced by the infamous dev's incapability to take criticisms and the squad of immature & imperious mods that bans players who killed them in-game. On the other hand, I am used to these kind of games. I am originally from Indonesia, and Steam wasn't very popular there. I spent years playing crappy online games which is much worse than Heroes and Generals and has worse Pay to Win system before I knew about Steam. And believe me, gaming devs that implement this kind of Pay to Win system will grow in an extremely slow rate, with most of them ending up in bankruptcy. Their revenue might be large but the volume of the financial flow will grow too slow, not growing at all, or even starts dropping where they'll have to cut down the pay to win system, leading to low or even negative profit.\n\nTheir main income sources are rich kids, new gamers, impulsive people, WW2 history nerd gamer, and pardon my language, complete idiots. They are the only ones who will spend money on this game and their population is decreasing rapidly with gamers' adaptation to the pay to win system. Gamers can't be so easily fooled to spend money on a pay-to-win game like those early online gamers back in 2000s. Their money-grabbing behavior just won't work in today's gaming community. The biggest flaw of Heroes & Generals' Pay to Win system is their limitation of the main gameplay itself, which is their main power. It is the only WW2 MMOFPS out there that has a large player base and they failed to use that advantage properly.\n\nCreating a pay wall in front of soldier classes, nickname change, weapon mods, land vehicles, and planes is an unbelievably imbecile pay-to-win implementation. Those things are the primary features that builds the main gameplay. Giving massively underpowered tanks to people who doesn't spend money is also a very foolish step. This pay wall prevent the teamwork element from running properly since the core of the game is guarded by a massive pay wall.\n\nIf they ever want to repair the reputation and ensure their companies' future, I suggest they completely remove the pay wall that limits the gameplay, lower all prices/increase income from each game to make it worthwile to play, remove durability system/lower the price to repair stuff, and remove the game from Free to Play section. People's price range varies but I personally willing to pay maximum $20 for this quality of game with no pay-to-win system as a prerequisite. If they remove the alpha and make the graphics, animations & textures better, plus adding more new significant features (new nations? new weapons? new planes? new vehicles?), I would definitely willing to pay up to $35 for a copy. Balance the guns and vehicles to prevent frustration on new players. Create a workshop and sell skins on community market just like CS:GO's strategy as an extra income that won't interfere with the gameplay. Add more guns to increase income from skins. Hire mature and professional mods. And many other stuff they could improve. They need to learn that this kind of behavior belongs to developing countries that is still new to online gaming compared to US and EU. For example, they would do well in Indonesia (not for long). Their current course is without question outdated and leads to failure.","September 6, 2014","false","31.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

I have been a huge supporter of this game 4 years or better.\n\nAny veteran player of this game would describe it as a diamond in the ruff.  The game 'has' huge potential.  Unforuntately, the RETO's lack of direction, lack of foresight, utter contempt for it's player community, and pure arrogance is what is holding this game's potential back.\n\nThis game has been steadily going downhill for years.  Each new build sees systems that should help the game improve, but the developers make poor design choices, take forever to fix them (if they fix them at all), and usually introduces changes that the community absolutely does not want.  Being in beta for years, and with over 2 dozen major feature builds (while in beta), is a healthy sign that this game looks like it is going somewhere, but after playing it for a while you will find it is going nowhere and fast.\n\nI really want to continue to support this game, but RETO makes it impossible.  Every build sees increased difficulty of new players to actively integrate into the game and become a long term stable player in the community.  One can no longer meaningfully participate in the war campaign RTS side of the game without serious restrictions.\n\nWaiting times increase in every build.  In match maker quickplay battles you wait in matchmaking queue.  Then you wait to spawn in game.  Then you wait to respawn if you die quickly (likely due to being spawncamped).  In the RTS side of the game, you grind for hours and hours as a new player to earn your first assault team, then you wait in deploy queue for timeframes measured in days.  You then wait for your at to move around which can take an hour.  Then you wait while a battle is prepared, then you wait for the battle to start, then you wait to spawn, then you wait in respawn deploy queue.  Wait wait wait.\n\nWant to play with your friends?  It's better if you have only 2.  Any more and you will be waiting for their battle to end, and not actually getting a chance to play the game.  Wait some more.\n\nMy suggestion? Wait until some other competent development team realizes what a great idea the marriage of RTS and FPS is, and then play that one.","May 29","false","363.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","1"

Thankfully the developers thought to include bicycles to help you get from point A to point B faster, but thats a whole nother issue I'll get to in a bit. Starting out, the maps seem big, it makes getting around a bit of a pain, but it doesn't seem too bad. You see, your first 3 ranks in the game are spent on 'training maps' or something like that, they are smaller than the average maps, but still pretty damned big. They feel comfortably sized relative to the number of players, although I think they could increase the number of players per side 50% and it would be even better. After your first 3 levels though, you go to campaign maps, and thats where it gets to be painful.\n\nThose maps are several times larger, you NEED bicycles or apcs or cars to get around on them, otherwise you'll never see anything, however the bicycles are harder to come by on those maps, meaning you have to hoof it. Thankfully as players progress through the game they can purchase the ability to spawn cars, apc's, tanks, etc. but in my experience, its possible to end up on a server where nobody on your team has them. These maps are so large that the distance between objectives is several minutes at walking speed. That might sound cool, except at least as far as I can tell, the number of players on these maps is no greater than the smaller ones, I've yet to see more than 18 players per side, while the maps themselves are easily the size of larger 64 v 64 Battlefield style maps, it feels like the 'correct' number of players would be more along the lines of 100 per side on these actually, especially due to the fact that the maps are pretty open, meaning that players can easily spend 20 minutes going through the wilderness not seeing anyone, only to pop up behind the enemy lines and just have a good time shooting them in the back... repeatedly... nonstop. Of course, this is something that SHOULD be in the game, but the ease at which its accomplished, due to the fact that at any given time the majority of players on a team will be between their nearest spawn point and the objective they are trying to capture makes it extremely frustrating and it can and does break your momentum and just lead to a frustrated player base.\n\nOh, and those bicycles I mentioned? While nice in theory, they have a serious drawback in that you cannot use your weapon while riding and they make you a HUGE target. You would think that it would be an easy fix, get say 75% of the way there on bike, dismount, and hoof it for the last 30 seconds to where you're trying to go... except on these campaign maps your opponent will usually see you almost as soon as you mount the bike, and they will be firing at you, and probably kill you... and if you do manage to get to that magic 75% mark and dismount, well remember how I said that the opposing team will frequently get behind your lines? Yup, they have an uncanny knack for popping out from behind a tree 15 feet behind you and shooting you dead while you're relatively helpless for the brief couple seconds it takes to dismount.\n\nAnd the other vehicles you can spawn like trucks, apcs, tanks, etc? Those are pretty cool, but again, you have to make an investment to acquire them and be able to use them, something not everyone does, and something which it doesnt seem that the matchmaking service (which is the only real way I've been able to get games... the game does let you pick your battles on the map, but ive yet to be able to get into any when i tried) takes that into account, as i've played on these larger maps where one side was almost entirely devoid of these vehicles, meaning they were forced to walk where bicycles weren't available. In fact, it gets worse, as it doesn't even attempt to balance the number of players with access to things like tanks against eachother. I am writing this, after having just completed a game in which the opposing team had not one, not two, but THREE tanks (mixture of Shermans and Hellcats) against my own teams ZERO, we had nothing larger than a Kubelwagen armed with a machine gun, which is effectively useless against heavy armored vehicles like the ones we were up against.\n\nTheoretically this is counteracted by the fact that players can equip themselves with things like panzerschrecks, bazookas, anti-tank mines, etc. but there are two problems with this - the first is that as far as I know this isn't possible DURING a battle, you have to have your loadout, etc. set up before the battle, the second issue is that access to these weapons is a function of both your rank and how much you're willing to pay. Yes, of course you can use the in-game currency to buy a panzerschreck instead of paying out of pocket, but its not really something you want to spend your credits on, as doing so means that you're not spending money on new rifles or weapons modifications, etc. Beyond that, equipping that panzerschreck occupies an equipment slot, which one im not sure, because I (like most it seems) haven't purchased a panzerschreck, which means - theoretically speaking - that you could end up equipping that weapon and ending up on a map where you have no real targets to use it against (I certainly haven't seen tanks very often, and the lighter vehicles like jeeps are easily handled with small arms).  The developers DID however seemingly have the foresight to provide the spawn areas with panzerfausts (and presumably a LAW type weapon for the allies), however that has yet to materialize as a viable solution in the games I've played. Picking up the panzerfaust means you have to carry the panzerfaust, as in it replaces your rifle, so when you inevitably encounter enemy infantry BEFORE you get close enough to actually be able to get a shot off at the enemy vehicle your options are to fire the panzerfaust at them in the hopes that you kill them, or drop the panzerfaust to pull your rifle back out, you'll often be killed before you can manage that. On top of that, the panzerfaust is rarely a one hit kill unless its one of the lighter vehicles like the jeep, and given that its a single fire weapon, that means that firign at the enemy tank won't kill it or necessarily even neutralize it, just damage it, so unless one of your other teammates managed to pick up a panzerfaust (its often not very easy to find), somehow survive long enough to get into engagement range and fire it off, chances are your opponents will have the tank repaired before you have a second shot.\n\nWhich brings me to my next issue with the game, cover. I love that the game requires you to move tactically to be successful, running in the open WILL GET YOU KILLED. Thats a good thing, I think. The problem is that crouching is terribly slow, and for all the open space on these maps, it will take you a REAL long time to get around that way. And dont even get me started on prone, it might make you harder to spot and hit, but it also makes you effectively defenseless, as you move unrealistically slow, and actually turning around while prone is evidently impossible, so if you need to see whats behind you... yeah, you're going to have to stand back up. On top of that, moving tactically is largely useless when your opponents are just as likely to be behind you as they are in front of you. Most of my deaths come from being shot from my side or rear, likewise most of the kills I have come from shooting someone from the side or in the back, even when I'm in a 'head-on-head' engagement. Anyway, thats all the character limit will allow me to say.","August 30, 2014","false","6.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

D end. The D day of H&G. It beated itself. It Defeated itself.\n\nI ask you one thing:\nHow is it possible that since the D update (~may 28) only guys with ~5-20 hours of playing write ++ reviews and veterans with 100+ hours (often with 1000 + hours) write negative reviews?\nEasily. Its due to the infamous "D" update!\n\n"D" update (short version):\nGame: - I love you!\nVeteran player: - I love you too!\nGame: - Die!\nVeteran player: --- (dead)\n\nThis game received a lot of bad and good ratings. Its edge over other fps games was the creativity you could use.\nYou can be easily sniped.... Though, the life of the snipers ain't as easy as you might think. You can (could...) always use your creativity.\n\nAre you sniped? Awww I hate snipers! So I create a character with a pistol, a knife and a binocular. I can run long distances easily (can reach sniper spots fast), I can spot hiding snipers with my binoculars, stab them in the back, and score 4-5 kills with their own sniper rifle.\n\nAre you ♥♥♥♥♥ by tanks? Awwww I hate tankers! So I create a character and equip him with a bazooka, HE grenade and a binocular. Or a bazooka, AT grenade and HE greande. Or a rifle and a bazooka. Or an SMG and sticky grenades...or...\nAnd I also create a tanker. And a fighter pilot.\n\nSince the "D" update you can't switch classes. If you are an infantry, you remain an infantry until the end of the battle. If you start as a pilot, you remain a pilot, etc.\n\nIt aint as bad...is it? Are you kidding?\nYou decide to be a pilot. As the match starts you realise the enemy has 3 pilots. You have no chance. You can't switch!! You stay as a pilot fighter....or you leave the match and wait 5 minutes till you can join another match.\n\nYou decide to be a tanker. A light tanker. You realise there are a lot of enemy heavy tanks. Being a light tank driver against them isn't fun. YOU CAN'T SWITCH!\nYou stay and die continiously, or you quit the match....and wait 5 minutes or more.\n\nBEFORE D update - only to get a touch of it:\nyou were able to consider when you wanna use your tank driver, your fighter pilot, your recon, your infantry... and your enemy did the same! Brain against brain. Sometimes they were waiting till we wasted 5-10 airplanes due to accidents and ground AA fire, and then suddenly 4 german players switched to fighter pilots to beat us into the ground. And sometimes we did the same. Its only a very small example. Your brain continiously worked on it.\n\n\nAFTER D update - only to get a touch of it:\nFor example, you look for a match as a paratrooper. You enter a match where there are enemy fighters. You jump and die. Jump and die. Jump and die. Boring. You can't switch to your AA truck character or to your fighter pilot character. YOU ARE A PARATROOPER NOW.\n\nYou are peredestined. If you are lucky, there won't be enemy airplanes, or there won't be skilled pilots. Anyway, whathever you do in that game since D update is only gambling. Its not up to you any longer!!! No strategy any longer! No considerations any more!\nPick your poison and die. Or live. Its not about your gears, not about your skills. Its about your luck.\nAnd then a lot of players, who had bad luck, obviously leave the match. So when you die and wanna respawn you see this:\n"Waiting for 6 teammates to fall"\n\nWTF, I was playing this game for 570 hours and never had to wait for 6 players to respawn. Probably 1....but not 6!! But yes, as the enemy players were unlucky they left the match (before update: they remained in the match and switch class, and you had an exciting match).\n\nRIP H&G.\nThank you developers for my 570 hours of pure fun. Its over. Problem is that you had the brain to create the coolest fps of the era. Then you've used the same brain to destroy it.\n\nYou will have a new player base within 48 hours. Average age drops by 5-10 years, as the game is deteriorated into a mindless shooter. Have fun kids!\n\nAs for me, you ask? I won't touch this....thing...any more. I'd like to preserve H&G in my memory at its height. As a good memory, not as a bad one.\n\n\nGuys, this game now got tricky. At firts glance it might seem its still cool. You spend your money. After playing some more you experience more about it and you discover all the flaws it has - since the D update. Forget this game till they cancel D update. Believe me. Forget it. It's not the same game since that. Its a shadow of its former glory. This way it\ngets boring really - REALLY - fast.\n\nThey say from now on squad leaders must consider how they set up their squads. And they think they've improved the strategy in this game. It's like killing 90% of strategy in the game and adding 5% to it and stating: We have improved strategy....\n\nD update. D end. The D day of H&G. It beated itself. It Defeated itself.","May 28","false","569.3"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviro/recommended/227940/","deviro","F|PFC. Deviro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deviro/","88 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSince I’m a huge Battlefield fan and seeing the death of the all-out-warfare behemoth makes me incredibly sad, I’m inclined to find alternatives. In my search, I stumbled upon the beta of Heroes & Generals – WWII FPS-strategy hybrid. It’s developed by Reto-Moto, a team consisting of ex-IO-Interactive founders.\n\nWhat they have done here with Heroes & Generals is fascinating: they’ve combined two very different games we love to play – an FPS: playing as a soldier on the field and a tabletop wargame: leading the whole war campaign strategy as a commander.\n\nWhich leads us to some very interesting territory – metagame in the form of wars, taking weeks until one of the sides (United States or Germany) wins. It’s like eRepublik, in the sense that the FPS battles that players fight directly influence the whole campaign map.\n\nYou can look at it as an MMO or just a regular FPS. But before I tell you if it is any good I have to mention few important things about it though.\n\nHeroes & Generals is Free2Play, which means it’s full of unlockables and all sorts of bars that measure your progress. The second warning is that this game is still in development, in fact, it was recently released on Steam Early Access (which means one of the two things – either there are going to be tons of micro patches or no mega patches at all (just kidding)).\n\nHow does it work?\n\nThe way the whole game is constructed is actually pretty interesting. Let me TRY to explain everything I have managed to grasp so far.\n\nImagine that the metagame is on a map with control points (CP) and roads in between them. Some control points are factories, that produce machines (tanks, planes, etc.) and cities, that produce ammunition and men.\n\nThe goal is for any of the sides to capture as many CPs as possible with assault teams (AT), that are created with men. ATs and supplies can be moved and commanders assign resources to each AT. When two opposing ATs meet in a control point, the matchmaker creates a room and regular soldiers fight in the so called Action Game – the FPS portion of this title.\n\nThe layout of main bases and capture points in the FPS map also differ, depending on the meta map. When one of the sides wins the battle, the according side assumes control over the point of interest.\n\nSounds interesting and at the same time confusing? It absolutely does!\n\nAufmerksamkeit Soldat!\n\nMy biggest interest is in the Action Game which I’ve spent 3 hours in so far.\n\nThe general impression I got from spending my time is that Action Game is very much like Red Orchestra (RO) – light realism and not fast paced Team Fortress 2. Depending on the map size and the resources the commander has made available, there are more vehicles in a given mission.\n\nFor example there is a hilly forest map where the only vehicles you will encounter are civilian bicycles. It is an adorable scene to watch people ride on this thing, given the fact that two people can get on it, while ringing its cute bell. But you might also fight in a map with light tanks that will shred you into pieces and planes that will drop payloads onto your little head.\n\nOne interesting aspect I noticed is the player count in Heroes & Generals – 18vs18. That seems like an odd choice to me, given the fact that most shooters go for 16vs16 or 32vs32.\n\nThe gunplay is not the most satisfying I’ve seen, but it’s not bad by any means, for me it’s above average. The gun recoil is actually pretty low, but the bullet spread is not a joke. The equipment you carry in Heroes & Generals compared to your regular $60 shooter is rather limited, here you start only with a rifle and few grenades. Unlocking additional weapons, gadgets and vehicles requires a lot of playing, hence the Free To Play structure of this game.\n\nUsually I don’t like when shooters have 30+ weapons, but the case here is different – there are too few – only handful of rifles and machine guns. I hope they add few more to the rotation as the development goes further.\n\nOne thing I noticed that people may dislike is that the player movement can be described as “sluggish” – there is momentum to it, like Miasmata. Another thing that surprised me about it was that in the crouch and lay down positions it’s way slower than other shooters like Red Orchestra and Battlefield – I don’t recommend crawling. There is also sprinting, but it acts like dashing, since you can’t sprint hundreds of meters. Also, jumping is floaty, like on a lower gravity Earth, which I hope gets refined.\n\nAs it is in our age, doing all sorts of things on the field in today's FPSs earns you combat badges. Heroes & Generals lets you equip those and have minor buffs, like +7.5% damage to armoured targets when you use the Chauffeur badge for example.\n\nThere is also an interesting game mechanic where you can’t get in enemy vehicles, unless you unlock them with holding “E” for some time, depending on the size of the machine you are trying to bust in.\n\nOne peculiar feature about the tanks I noticed is that you can get in third person view, but that exposes your characters model for easy shots from the hostile outside world. I think this is an interesting trade off for those who like to be always aware of their surroundings.\n\nEnemy technical spotted!\n\nBecause Heroes & Generals is still not baked properly, if you decide to play it now, among the fun you are going to have, you will also be greeted with some frustrating and clearly not finished features.\n\nWhile most F2P MMOs in engine rendering, server browser and character screens are seemingly in one window, this is not the case with Heroes & Generals. The 3D rendered scenes are done separately from the other features mentioned above, like Battlelog in the newer Battlefield titles. Which results in a relatively smooth Action Game, while the Commander map is working very slow.\n\nThen there is the options menu that can be accessed only in the Action Game, where aren’t that many graphical options to begin with, but good set of sound ones. You can bind your keys, but one thing that bothered me was that I had to hold right mouse button to stay in sights, which I’ve never liked to do in any game.\n\nAll of this also means that the server browser/character screens have their own options menu, which makes things a bit confusing.\n\nOne of the weakest points of this game is its lobby user interface. The server browser is lackluster, where you can’t see the actual ping values. When I jumped blind into this game I tried to use the queue system – don’t bother. There aren’t that many people playing Heroes & Generals right now, just look for Enter Combat->Find Mission and then try to find a game that has Join Mission on the session overview screen.\n\nThe whole unlocking and finding the different customization options can also be a bit confusing at first glance.\n\nAnother complaint I have is when a war starts, you have to choose which side you will fight on for the duration of it. Which means that your account will be tied to either US or Germany. After the war ends you can change your faction.\n\nFreundlich Basis voraus\n\nTo be honest even when I mention all of the problems Heroes & Generals has, just talking about the game makes me want to play it more. The game might not be the next Battlefield, but it doesn’t necessarily need to be either.\n\nWhat we have here are some solid foundations, where something really cool can be made and enjoyed by a lot of people. Here is hoping Reto-Moto makes Heroes & Generals even better!","July 16, 2014","true","6.6"," 42 of 76 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","42","76","0","5"

The mechanics are solid and the maps well desinged considering the Domination-esque game mods that i have played so far.  I would recommed this game to anyone who likes First Person Shooters, as it is highly satisfying nailing your target across a foggy expanss where visability through your iron sights is limited.\nBut that is where the recomendations stop, completely.\nPay To Win is a term i hate, because alot of the time ( in my experience of both console, Xbox 360, PS3 and PS4 and now PC ) it terns out to be true, and i cant help feeling that its no different in this rough diamond of a game. Such a shame the devs have made it so that it takes nearly 5 hours, depending on your skill level, to unlock a sidearm. And even then you have to spend an arm and a leg to buy it with currancy earned via playing the game, or use "gold" which is expensive to buy (real money wise) which is just stupid in my opinion, as this grind fest makes the game not worth playing.\nIf this were say a £7.99 game or a £9.99 game with no rediculous microtransactions or a reasonable progression system, it would a feather in the cap of WW2 FPS's availble now.","September 4, 2015","false","3.6"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","0"

I started playing the game earlier in 2014, having a mediocre time due to the same problems listed before; only to check up on the game with the new Russian inclusion of the game to find the same problems compounded.\n\nAnd finally the Early Access part of the game; why finish a game that has no end but for the players to grow tired of never ending spawn-killing from tanks, snipers and the rush of Sub machine gunners to capture a base against your default weapon.\n\n\nAll in all, this game is a dissappointing No to the recommended portion.

Another two broken things are PPS Sudajev and M1/M2, PPS is like minigun with laser sight, it has fast reload, big mag, zero recoil and its totally noob friendly, M1/M2 was used in Korea war! and devs consider it as BALANCED option in WW2 game. Iam playing as germany and i can confirmed that STG is worst top gun to unlock, it gets totally destroyed by PPSs and M1/M2s in mid range.\n\nAnother wtf thing are tanks, Sherman E8 has better armor then Tiger (WTF?), IS2 with 122 mm gun has damage of much smaller cannon and fast reload speed. It shows that devs dont understand tanks and other vehicles, its same with weapons, calling Walther P38 revolver is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, is doesnt excuse them when they are calling magazine pistol revolver, lol?\n\nI cant forget toxic, desparate community, which is defending game with stupid argument that you can unlock everything, yes, you can, but with premium.

Oh I know! I'll start on how crap this game is and how grindy it is!\n\nFirst, you get in and have to level up to play a different map and it is a endless grind to level up. Second of all, to get a attachment for your gun you have to grind endlessly to level it up and then on top of that you have to grind to earn the money to buy the attachment. Then, if you want another gun guess what you have to do! That's right! DO SOME MORE FLIPPING GRINDING TO UNLOCK THE GUN, BUT PLOT TWIST, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT AS WELL!

This can be a fun game. And I HOPE, that this game is fun when it is finished. But, the beta lacks balance. In the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. That is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. Anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. Some may say,"Oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon." I would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. The first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. To hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. Besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then.\nI haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. Most of the maps, I've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. Killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. Only five to be exact. However, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective.\nThe lack of progress is irratating. Because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. After about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. You then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. Plus, the first American smg is significantly better than the German counterpart because of its lack of recoil.\nAfter almost twelve hours pf gameplay, I still can't afford the smg, I'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and I'm frankly at wits end. I will say that at first it was fun, but now I find myself getting annoyed. I am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like I haven't made any progress. I think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. If you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. But their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.","May 30","false","36.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

That is also something i loved about this game, since you can mod your guns the way you like them. A big disadvantage about the grinding and modding thing is that people you'll fight against as a beginning player will have better guns, but that is not that bad since its lots of fun to play.\n\nIt was huge fun to participate in a battle with tanks, planes, and lots of lil' infantry jimmy's. There was still a lot of work to do, since hits werent always counted and character movement was quite poor. Reto improved that and added lots of stuff to the game in the updates. A little bit to much probably. We have loads of camo to choose from now but we only have a few maps to fight in. They keep adding camo and and unnecessary stuff (like the third german pistol), but it seems like they dont care about adding new maps. In one of the last updates they added more vegetation, but all they did was copy paste the same bush all over the place. After 5 years of early access developing, the graphical part of the game is still very bad.\n\nSomething else i dont like about the game is the toxic community who wants reto to nerf everything they get killed with. Thats also because of the different types of players (e.g. tankers want to nerf anti tank stuff, infantry wants to nerf tanks). I used to play all classes and i think it is pretty balanced. Reto did a good job on balancing, allthough the russians are a little bit underpowered and germans a bit overpowered (e.g. MG42(1200 max rpm) and the heavily armored tanks).\n\nTill this "Devyatayev" squad update hit i absolutely loved it. Sometimes the battles where a little unbalanced, e.g. when the enemys had lots of tanks and your team had none, but if u had a tanker u could easily switch and kick some ♥♥♥. This is diffirent right now. You have to grind your squad ribbon to be able to switch to diffirent classes. I have quit a lot of characters, I need to grind em all up to be able to play normally again. Another thing about this squad system is that you can never play alone, you will always be in a squad with some random guys who are f*cking around.\n\nThey have done such a thing with the ribbon system in an earlier update, when they went through the ribbon system, but it wasnt that bad, since u could still use all of your characters. At that time, there were not that much experienced players with lots of characters, so it didnt matter that much. Right now, there are lots of player who have grinded their way up and have lots of characters. They will all have to grind that ribbon on their characters to be able to play normally again.\n\nWith this being said, i dont recommend this game to new players, since it is still in early acces and things like this will probably happen some more in the future. It will also take a long time before it can be released, because there is still a lot of work to do, especially the amount of maps(maps are all same scenery) and graphical part of the game is very poor. For someone who just starts, this new squad (ribbon) system wont be the problem, you'll just level ur squad ribbon up through playing while ur grinding for better equipment. But still, something like this might happen again in the future, so you'll be just as mad on reto as a big part of the community right now.\n\nIf Reto dont chance this squad system and refuse to add new maps and if they dont improve the graphical part of the game im gonna leave and play some battalion 1944 or Red orchestra, or even WW1 (Verdun, Battlefield 1) instead. I always liked Heroes and generals more than other ww2 games like battalion and red orchestra just because of the tank, plane and infantry gameplay all together and of course because of the generals part of the game. If not this is after Warthunder the second Free2play WW2 game im gonna quit because the developers are f*cking it up.","May 27","false","229.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Oh I know! I'll start on how crap this game is and how grindy it is!\n\nFirst, you get in and have to level up to play a different map and it is a endless grind to level up. Second of all, to get a attachment for your gun you have to grind endlessly to level it up and then on top of that you have to grind to earn the money to buy the attachment. Then, if you want another gun guess what you have to do! That's right! DO SOME MORE FLIPPING GRINDING TO UNLOCK THE GUN, BUT PLOT TWIST, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT AS WELL! After you've grinded for 100000000000000000000000 hours you then see some people in tanks and think. "I want a tank", you then go to the menu to see how to get a tank, but it's too confusing to get around it so you search it up and find out you have to grind for another 2 years.\n\nAll in all it's a grindy grindfest full of grinding to grind more.\n\nLet's leave this review on a happy note, here are some random grindy phrases I had to spend 100 years grinding to unlock.\n\n10/10 would grind again\n2 grindy 4 me\nlove to grind on my skateboard\n\n(Yes I have only played 4 hours on steam, but I have played a lot more before it was on steam so I know what it's like)","May 30","false","4.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

This can be a fun game. And I HOPE, that this game is fun when it is finished. But, the beta lacks balance. In the game, you will start as a regular soldier with a basic semi-automatic rifle. That is fine in all, except when you are in any mid-range or closer fighting. Anyone with a smg, sub-machine gun, will easliy murder you, inless you get a headshot, which is very unlikely. Some may say,"Oh, why don't you use grenades or a melee weapon." I would respond with, you don't start with either of those weapons. The first two german grenades don't do good damage unless the explosion is close. To hit someone with a melee weapon basically requires you to be so close that it is only effective from behind. Besides, if they have a machine gun, you will be dead long before then.\nI haven't mentioned sniping yet and that is because there is no incentive. Most of the maps, I've seen, aren't suited very well for sniping. Killing doesn't give you that much xp, experience. Only five to be exact. However, you can get over a hundred points for capturing an objective.\nThe lack of progress is irratating. Because at first you don't realize that smgs are important, you will spend all your money upgrading your rifle, assuming that it will help. After about six hours of gameplay, you spend all of your starting money on buying the first grenades, melee weapon, and upgrades. You then realize that you should've saved it for the overpowered smgs. Plus, the first American smg is significantly better than the German counterpart because of its lack of recoil.\nAfter almost twelve hours pf gameplay, I still can't afford the smg, I'm reduced to endlessly grinding for money, and I'm frankly at wits end. I will say that at first it was fun, but now I find myself getting annoyed. I am only rank four, out of twenty two and feel like I haven't made any progress. I think that this game could be fun, but there is some massive issues with balance. If you are really into fps, than you could have fun with knowledge going in. But their is a massive amount of grinding needed to actually get anywhere in the game.","May 30","false","36.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

My opinions are as follows:\n\nPros:\n- WWII FPS with a lot of potential.\n- Infantry-based gameplay can be quite dynamic, and there are plenty of options to better shape how you play on the battlefield.\n- Battles can be quite dynamic, especially with the sheer size of the teams (which can reach over fourty people when lumped together).\n- The game performs well, and is generally easy to run at higher settings without sacrificing memory or framerate.\n\nCons:\n- The Devs are more focused on adding new content, as opposed to hearing their community out/fixing problems that are currently detrimental to the flow and feel of the game.\n- The graphics are so-so, though the effects can be quite straining on the eyes.\n- Assets and high-tier weapons, which have to be unlocked after lengthy grinds, can be quite imbalanced and are often \'spammed\' - especially in the assault game mode.\n- In spite of the variety available to players as they advance, the new \'squad\' system has effectively squashed many of the previously effective means of combatting an overflow of one thing, such as tanks or aircraft, which can make battles quite one-sided.\n- Badges, which are used to better augment your soldier/tailor your performance to your style of play, are implemented poorly. Unless you run with veteran membership, there are only a few that will objectively net you the most for the grind involved in picking them up.\n\nAfter several years of early access and beta status, this game reeks of confusion in its management and a team of developers who have no central idea of what they want the game to be - as well as a poor relationship with the community, who they rarely listen to. When this game is at its best, it can be really, really good fun, especially if you bring a friend or two with you to make things even more interesting. At its worst, it\'s a grind that can leave you feeling frustrated and unfufilled, especially if you haven\'t unlocked the best toys to play with.\n\nMore often than not, assets have a widely eschewed place on the battlefield. There are some games where tanks and aircraft lend more to the dynamic, and fill a position that better suits the flow of the game (tanks push points/eliminate hostile vehicles, and aircraft battle for air superiority before attempting much the same), while the overwhelming majority seem to lean in favour of overflow.\n\nI cannot tell you how many games I\'ve had to sit through running panzerfausts (the only form of AT that spawns on each of the maps) hoping that I\'d be able to deal with tanks while they camp my team out of the spawn; nor how many times I\'ve been bombed trying to rejoin the fight after being knocked out somewhere closer to the front lines; nor can I tell you how many times I\'ve loaded up a vehicle or tank, only to find myself inundated with mines before the admittedly weak spawn protection feature (rendering you invisible to the enemy until a handful of seconds had passed) faded. And with the new squad update, dealing with this has become even harder than before.\n\nTankers, unless they grind for squad points to load their squad with auxillary seats allowing any of the other branches, are effectively helpless against players who camp spawns/run only AT. With the most recent update, they\'re also stuck with incredibly long respawn times (I\'ve had up to 400 seconds before I could spawn, drive five feet, and then die to another spawncamper only to repeat the same process again).\n\nInfantry have less of a way to deal with airborne and fighters, as they can no longer load up their own fighters unless they repeat the same process as above, except with fighter seats. The same applies for tanks, assuming no-one on their team is either focused enough or advanced enough to have picked up AT of any form. The panzerfausts I mentioned earlier are only good up to end-tier medium tanks, and even then, only from the sides and rear.\n\nFighters, admittedly, face the least danger, as nearly all forms of AA are useless (though tankers can fill that role reasonably well if they get a good line of fire.), but they are no less disadvantaged against any number of problems, should they find themselves outnumbered/matched or without targets to shoot at/try to harry.\n\nThe gameplay, once you advance far enough, can get quite monotonous. Most players run the \'Heavyset\' badge, usually accompanied by some form of SMG (which are usually way, way more accurate than they aught to be. The PPS, as an example, is ludicrously accurate even out to medium range, provided you can see your target) - though there are still a fair number of people who use sniper-rifles, rifles or more varied loadouts. My only serious complaint here is that certain nations have weapons that are innately better than others, and some without any real equal among the other nations\' ladder of weapons/arms. The Russians are able to pick up the PTRD anti-tank rifle, while no other nation has a weapon of that caliber at their disposal. Americans have sticky grenades, which face neither the penetration problems of thrown AT grenades against some medium and heavy tanks, and often \'correct\' onto whatever you\'re throwing them at. The Germans have access to MGs that no other nation can reasonably field, though their place is admittedly niche at best. And thus far, reto has only continued to throw new things in while doing nothing to fix any of the above.\n\nI still play this game because I have fun juuuuust enough to keep me hopeful that my experience won\'t completely sour, but there are times where I leave this game halfway wanting to uninstall it.

If someone uses real money to purchase a gun you'll feel it, the game is very much, pay to win.\nFree credits are not well balanced, specifically designed to be hard to earn to buy new weapons, so that you'll be more tempted to use your hard earned cash.\nYou think that if a game was to have hard to earn rewards, it'd take a Planetside 2 approach, and make all guns have strengths, weaknesses and be overall balanced. but they are not. The Thompson for example is the be all end all of submachine guns, I picked one up from an enemy and a quick burst of 3 bullets to the chest was all it took to down an enemy.\nhowever with the Grease Gun, america's starting SMG it took around 20, requiring the full clip if you miss.\nThe german starting SMG is also stronger than the Grease Gun as well.\nThere's not a large variety of guns either, which makes me question it a little, considering that I remember a larger array of weaponry in similar WW2 shooters.\n\nThe game is fun, refreshing even, however the unfairness of it's economy and weapon tier system really ruin the fun.\nUnbalanced weaponry and inconsistent weapons between both factions, leaves something to be desired.\nThis game would really benefit from leaving it's limitations, creating a third fictional faction to make battles 3 ways, or even adding the ability for 3 way battles which would include weaponry specific to that faction based in that time frame.\nThis game is in need of a massive overhaul in order to improve player satisfaction and balance between all players, new and long running.\n\nAlso, a quick mention for server maintenance, this game is riddled with it, atleast 30% of the time when I want to jump on, there's server maintenance, and this isn't for short periods of time, these are long downtimes, that when the time to be taken is predicted, takes anywhere from 2 to 8 hours, and when the maintenance is unexpected bugfixes or anything along those lines, the game can be done for a whole night, with no time given to players as to when it'll be back up.\n\nMy verdict: a good game turned sour by it's online shop.\n\n6/10","September 7, 2014","false","27.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I have seen, well, not much improvement.  They continue to add shinny items, but fail to fix the glaringly broken ones.  Frequent crashes, Funky UI, ZERO clan system, broken and unblanced weapons, wonky maps, buggy vehicles, weapons and terrain.  It seems with the last build this game is looking for WHALES.  They want players to come in and dump tons of real cash to advance.  BE WARNED, THIS GAME IS A HUGE GRIND!  It will take you YEARS to advance a toon.  YEARS...unless ofcourse you want to spend tons of real cash on it.  Every new build brings new bugs and inbalance.  DO NOT waste your time here folks.  For NEW players, you will think its all great until you hit level 3 or 5, then you will see how screwed up the game really is.  3 years running now, and its still in "BETA."  The ENGINE is OLD and looks like BF1942, the video on the store page are not the real graphics, but an embelished version.  DON'T DO IT folks.

It worked very well.  That's the good news.

Boy Squad 2.0 is not what I expected it to be. I am un-offically calling this update "Reto's Choke Collar". Why is it a choke collar you might ask? Before you used to get into a squad of 6 infantry and play with your friends and switch classes/ Assult teams while in game... Now you are stuck to one assult team( with the exception of this stupid auxillary seat system which I will get to later). So bascially, If mid war game you were resupplied with say tanks, and you wanted to use them you would need essentally psychic powers to be able to tell the future and make sure you've chosen the correct auxillary squad seat, and on top of that you need to be the squad leader to make sure you have that auxillary seat. No, just stop right there Reto. This is not squad 2.0, this is squad 1.0000000001. For literally years I've been waiting for a squad system that will do the following:\n1. Invite who I want\n2. Invite However many I want(6-12 players seem fine)\n3. Choose what Role to play\n4. Join a game a 1 unit/clan\n\nNow its impossible to join a specific War battle as a solo player. You know whats stupid, To be able to invite more friends I need to unlock these damned ribbons; rather I need to spend credits/gold to invite the same number of friends as I could before this update??? Thats like... you going to your favorite hot dog stand and you always paid 2.50$(usd) for a hotdog with whatever toppings you wanted then suddenly one day, the hot dog guy says: " Yo times are tough its gonna be an extra .50 cents per topping..." You think you\'re gonna go back to the hot dog stand? I don't think so. So why should I fully commit to this game agian?\n\nPositive notes: T-20 is pretty cool\n\n\nBelow is my origional Review\n1,192 of 1,368 people (87%) found this review helpful\n85 people found this review funny\n\nNot Recommended\n2.9 hrs last two weeks / 2,387.0 hrs on record\nPosted: Jan 26 @ 9:00am\n\nEARLY ACCESS REVIEW\nI\'ve been an active member of the Heroes and Generals Community For more than a year now, I\'ve hosted a teamspeak which has brought in thousands of unique players to play heroes and generals. I Co-Hosted for the Battle Vision Contest to replace westwick. I created the largest english speaking Clan for Soviets Called \"Red Star Union.\" I\'ve been tossed away like used tissue paper. I\'ve been banned on the forums for open critism on the game, and the forums are littered with German Fanboys. On top of that, this is the ban message I recieve(More like a ban threat): http://i.imgur.com/wHP4RIb.png . I don\'t have any more interest in this game and I am moving on to another game. If they want to treat me like this because I am so openly critical of their game, so be it. I feel like i wasted my last year and half believing in this game, Thinking that they accually listen to the players, but they don\'t. I don\'t recommend this game to anyone.\nDeveloper response:\nReto.Circinus  [developer] Posted: Feb 25 @ 9:22am\nGringojs, you never got banned for your constructive critism on the game and admittedly, you had some good topics and posts like that as well. The primary reason why we suspended your forum account is that you were harassing and intentionally provoking other players, which would result in flame wars.\n\nYou know our rules, you have been active on the forums and the game for a long time, yet you continued to violate them even after we suspended your account. You have received plenty of warnings prior to your permanent suspension from the forums.\n\nLook at this from our perspective as well please, We\'d love to spend more time on critism and constructive feedback, but the Developers naturally get discouraged to read the forums when\'s too much trolls and flamers running around spoiling a lot of the topics.\n\nAs Reto.Robotron3000 said it: When you decided to start flaming devs & other players and posting troll posts on the forums we had to ban you, just like we would do with *any* other player.\n\nShould you have any interest to resolve this, feel free to contact me or Reto.Robotron3000.","June 1","false","388.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","85"

At an average ping of 63ms, you will be subject to lag like you were playing with 500ms ping. I wish I was exaggerating, but the delay really does range anywhere from a quarter of a second to a second and a half, two seconds. The more likely answer is that the servers are being operated out of tin cans in Somalia.\n\nThe game tries to make a selling point of massive battlefields with tons of players, when really you're lucky if you get 20v20. I mean come on. That's just barely better than the typical 16v16 on a console. This isnt a console game.\n\nThe economy is HORRIBLY steep.\nRepair and rearm costs will put you out in the streets, and a bolt action rifle from WWI costs you as much as a medium tank.\n\nThe hitboxes are buggy and suffer from horrible hit detection, much like Battlefield 4 does, however, this game doesnt have nearly the amount of calculations per second to handle that BF4 does. Even when the game detects that you hit someone, it doesnt always detect that you did damage. I've had instances of five confirmed torso hits on a player before with the M1 Garand until he died; a weapon that generally takes two or three hits in this game.\n\nThe developers don't claim that this game is supposed to be a simulator, in fact they blatantly say it isnt. But some of the crap they put in the game is so unrealistic it borderlines on straight up make-believe. Scopes and sights affecting stopping power? It's as if they've never even handled a weapon in real life. Airborne can only carry one weapon. Can't even carry hand grenades or AT grenades with your primary. What happened, Reto? Did a five year old tell you how soldiers were outfitted in WWII?\n\nAll in all, it's a decent game with some good ideas, but it is much further behind development schedule than they would claim. A lot of the game still needs balancing and fine tuning before it should be called a beta. Until the actual state of the game catches up to the developers declaration of it, I will not recommend this game.","September 13, 2014","false","105.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The answer to the other question is simply, “Yes”.\n\nEach round players are awarded credits according to their performance relative to everyone else on the server.  Each round credits are deducted a specific amount for every bullet you fired, every grenade you threw, and for “maintenance” of the equipment that you brought into the match.  These are the “Heroes” in “Generals and Heroes”, apparently burdened with the cost of supplying and maintaining their patriotism-waging equipment.\n\nI can only surmise that this must have something to do with the overarching concept that some general, somewhere, has to sign off on requisition forms to get bullets, grenades, and the WWII equivalent of hot pockets into the hands of soldiers every time they want to put boots on the ground.  This mechanic is what puts the “Generals” into the “Heroes and Generals” of this game.  Not really sure how that part works because I like to emphasize the “Free” in “Free to Play”, and putting on a General hat seems to involve either grinding away at this game for a very long time or handing over real life currency.\n\nIf you have ever wanted to a play a game where pulling the trigger was preceded by a momentary pause to consider the cost of taking a shot, or enjoy tallying the expenditures of a military campaign down to the level of individual bullets, this is the game for you.\n\nIt is otherwise a pretty straightforward WWII first-person-shooter.","September 27, 2015","true","21.6"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","0"

I'd leave it at neutral if I could. The game itself is fun. You got vehicles and explosions all about. I enjoy that it does retain some sense of realism to it.\nHere's why I'm neutral on it: The best teams to join in when you start off the game is American. If you start off as Soviet Union or Germany though, you will probably not see victories unless the opposing team has way less members than you, or until you reach the point of seeing automatic weapons on your team being used. When you join a match, you'll begin to realize that the Americans have fully automatic weapons and even vehicles with MGs on them. As for the Soviets? Well, we start off with semi automatic rifles and jeeps/trucks that serve no purpose other than transport.\nWhy is this a problem? A lot of the starting battles take place at close range so the full auto guns have complete advantage over the Soviet Union. The armed vehicles actually suppress and deteriorate any advance made by Soviet Union.\n\nYou could say "Get skill" but really, it wouldn't matter. You can be extremely skilled and yet, be so limited due to the crappy Soviet loadout. It seems you would actually need to PAY to win as the Soviets. So unless I begin to see the starter battles look less biased towards Americans, my opinion won't change.","July 26, 2015","false","10.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

And why? Imagine a tank which cant cross a shallow river, weapon which has 720 but can be modded into 1028 when other one has 514-600 rate of fire, "best" weapons in game cost few hundreds of thousands credits but you can be rekt just by base rifle from more than 100m while running and get headshot. When you die you see position of enemy who killed you (stupid idea), some rifles can be modded to kill by one shoot no matter which part of body you hit but of course there is something called heavy set so you can survive even shoot from weapon with more than 100 damage (seems legit). There is more cars,  motorcycles than tanks, planes or other "heavy" vehicles. One guy can take more than 6 AT grenades, get on his mororcycles go to respawn and just wait for enemy tank. One guy can explore WHOLE map and see where tanks will respawn and thats ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Once, i joined a battle and i respawned first time and what? MINE!!!

A great FPS game (some frustrating learning curves) and a social RTS game.\n\nBest advice I can give to new players is to ask questions.

So my timing on the game might be short, but that is because I am a long time player before Steam release.\n\nSo I originally got into this game as an alpha before Steam hit, back then the game was starting out and came a long way since then.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are actually quiet good and overal a nice touch on the game with some cool effects and detailing when in battle and not.\n\nControls: These actually take some getting used too, I found the character control to be slightly annoying but then that could be the kinda sim feel to the game I think, but it does take some time to get used too, so be warned.\n\nAudio: The game is basically WWII sounds and so on, I must say some of the sounds in the game are really good and spot on with detail and worth having it loud.\n\nNow the game and it's features:\n\nWould you say the game is pay to win? Yes, with what I seen in the game it is very easy to buy some of the best stuff and just run around killing stuff quickly.  You also get a few idiots in the game that just mess around in the middle of battle, which is highly annoying but then in the middle of a battle you see a guy on a pushbike riding past a tank, rather amusing and enjoyable.\nEven though there that kinda pay to win aspect of the game, you can earn the stuff in the game still as it just takes some more time to get there, so that is annoying but then being a very enjoyable game I cannot really doubt it because the game is very fun and mixed with the graphics which are very detailed I would say, full looking around.... massive plus.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Yes and no, and the only no is the pay to win on the game, but everything else is yes without a doubt.\n\nA free to play WWII shooter, basically an updated BF1942 game with kinda more.","November 5, 2015","true","1.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

So my timing on the game might be short, but that is because I am a long time player before Steam release.\n\nSo I originally got into this game as an alpha before Steam hit, back then the game was starting out and came a long way since then.\n\nGraphics: The graphics are actually quiet good and overal a nice touch on the game with some cool effects and detailing when in battle and not.\n\nControls: These actually take some getting used too, I found the character control to be slightly annoying but then that could be the kinda sim feel to the game I think, but it does take some time to get used too, so be warned.\n\nAudio: The game is basically WWII sounds and so on, I must say some of the sounds in the game are really good and spot on with detail and worth having it loud.\n\nNow the game and it's features:\n\nWould you say the game is pay to win? Yes, with what I seen in the game it is very easy to buy some of the best stuff and just run around killing stuff quickly.  You also get a few idiots in the game that just mess around in the middle of battle, which is highly annoying but then in the middle of a battle you see a guy on a pushbike riding past a tank, rather amusing and enjoyable.\nEven though there that kinda pay to win aspect of the game, you can earn the stuff in the game still as it just takes some more time to get there, so that is annoying but then being a very enjoyable game I cannot really doubt it because the game is very fun and mixed with the graphics which are very detailed I would say, full looking around.... massive plus.\n\nWould I recommend the game? Yes and no, and the only no is the pay to win on the game, but everything else is yes without a doubt.\n\nA free to play WWII shooter, basically an updated BF1942 game with kinda more.","November 5, 2015","true","1.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Then you get into the game. I used to play a lot of CoD back in the day, I don't know whether I got so rusty or is it the game. It's just so clunky shooting at things, it just doesn't fell reliable or good for me, it's just really annoying. And I think they know that. Hence the whole currency system. Yeah you're not having fun, but you can earn points and buy better gear, so that should keep you playing.\n\nYou get a bad gun at the beginning, and you are supposed to kill stuff exclusively with that gun for FIFTEEN HOURS if you want to get a decent one. But have to play more if you want good upgrades. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the more points you get in game the more currency you are awarded. If you just got out out of the low level incubator, you are pinned against experienced people with tanks snipers etc. I personally didn't like running 3 minutes to the battlefront just to get shot down from who knows where (in CoD that only took like 10 seconds).\n\nMy point is, I am really really frustrated by the game. There is no real reason for me to play it. I found playing the game a drag, with the only motivation being getting currency for better guns. You spawn, you run for 2-3 mins and maybe, maybe you kill a few peeps or even make a cap. If you are new and haven't spent money that will be the case. I know, the graphics are good, the models are pretty, it has cars and tanks and planes and on paper it's a really good game model. But I got little actual fun from it. To the devs: I really don't know what would make me rethink, maybe drastically lower grind times I dunno. Sry. My opinion: A pretty looking grindy waste of time.","May 8, 2015","false","86.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","8","12","2","0"

Honestly, the amount of effort a player puts into ranking up isn't worth the effort if they're just going to dump you into an inbalanced match. Each match is just a curbstomp battle against the one side, whether or not your team sports the greater amount of highlevels with the top tier vehicles/ classes. The better weapons cost to much to repair to make a profit on just about anything, the community is toxic, and there is little to no way to stop snipers from spawn killing.

HOWEVER getting headshots and kills is verry rewarding and there is real tension due to 1 shot kills.\n\nconclusion: the game is verry good in places and at times however it is pay to win becouse everything that isn't standart inf is clearly better to a more or lesser degree. the game has issues balance wise and some smaller ones in other departmends but don't count on any of them being fixed sins there were no noticable changes in my 2 to 3 years of not playing the game. there are better free to play shooters and this game is only free to play in the most strict meaning of the word.","May 8, 2015","false","12.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The economy in game makes battlefield heros look well made, after grinding for a day I bought a RPG, 5 games later the repair cost for it was the same as the buy price making it utterly unprofitable to use (loosing maybe 3k a match if I wanted to keep using it) stock weapons are a joke with their upgraded variaints a ♥♥♥♥ take whilst I only played germans I picked up enough american grease guns to know it would be quicker to kill a man with actual grease, the tompson however is capable of 720 no scope cross map one shots (only a slight exaggeration). Another example is the bolt action rifle, its useless at first and is so expensive that it is impracticle to buy it without money, each mod which is needed to turn it into a frikkin laser beam capable of oneshotting anything even with a leg shot (not an exaggeration) each then cost the same as the intial purchace. This is only shadowing one major ♥♥♥♥ up of design, the squad set up. If you want to play with your friends and they are a different class than you, then you are not playing with them simple as. To become a tanker or pilot it now costs around 50,000 ingame credits after todays patch, (that's a lot)  you then need to pay to change back to infantry and if you need to do this then you are going to pay another 50k to become a tanker again...

While BF1942 was a well optimized, balanced and supported game, then Heroes and Generals' "potential" that is so often mentioned in these reviews comes from actually cannibalizing the old school WW2 shooter. The controls are similarly floaty (yet still way more awkward), the battle maps are equally large yet fairly linear (but with fewer people on teams to create a real ghost town effect) and the concept centered around combined arms warfare (without the class system that actually enabled infantry to compete with mechanized branches of war).\n\nAnd to make matters worse than the "borrowing" from BF1942 being done ineptly, it is all coated with a great helping of P2W glazing. Where you could just jump in a plane or pick a sniper class in BF1942 and have the experience guide you to be better and better and eventually a competitive player of your own, here you either need to slog through a horrifying grind where you are essentially left at the hands of those people who fate has somehow decreed to own better weapons than you (and be grateful if it's only a high tier SMG instead of a freaking tank), or simply those who (for some reason or another) have decided to support the game with their hard-earned cash.\n\nNow, I can see why the game piques one's interest. The concept of being a foot soldier commanded by humans high up the food chain is something video games don't really do that often, but as things stand, for an FPS player, the "Generals" aspect seems foreign and indecipherable as they seem to do little more than imbalance specific scenarios, which, from a strictly FPS point of view, is incredibly infuriating. Maybe I'm just not clever enough to pick up why things happen the way they do, but as a simpleton of a simple soldier, the fact that I'm given a low tier weapon and am expected to die against opposition far better armed than me is immensely unfair. Maybe this is what "Heroes" references - the men of WW2 who were indeed put in hopeless and unfair situations - but I cannot see how such exposure to real tragedies is fun to anyone but the most sadomasochistic roleplayer.\n\nAnd as such, I'm left with slogging through the game, hoping to unlock that amazing sniper rifle I picked up off the ground once and went on a fifteen to nothing killing spree with. But it's way too long of a stride and offers little on the way - and considering how the battles are empty and chaotic (20 players per team seems to be a good haul - on maps that force you to ride bikes to control points only to be scythed down by better-equipped players it means that you will almost never be allowed to "pick your own battles", if you catch my drift) it doesn't really strike me as being worth it. Unfortunately these core issues do not look like they'll be fixed any time soon. I can handle floaty and imprecise controls when the concept gives me enjoyment, but there is so much infuriating me about every aspect of the game that long playing sessions are out of the question. As such I'm left with quick spurts of 30-40 minutes of gameplay, which obviously means that unlocking any of the high tier weaponry is a pipe dream at best.\n\nSo is this game worth contributing towards? Honest to god, if you have any money to spare, organize some kind of revival of BF1942 instead. If you play this for free, consider that you won't get any long term enjoyment of it. Value the initial few hours skirmishes and move on. But all in all, this one is just a major let down.","February 27, 2015","false","9.8"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Pay to win is everywhere, vehicles are a joke to fight as they can kill you without effort from either 50m or 500m and unless you put a anti-tank weapon in your loadout before you start even searching then GG. The economy in game makes battlefield heros look well made, after grinding for a day I bought a RPG, 5 games later the repair cost for it was the same as the buy price making it utterly unprofitable to use (loosing maybe 3k a match if I wanted to keep using it) stock weapons are a joke with their upgraded variaints a ♥♥♥♥ take whilst I only played germans I picked up enough american grease guns to know it would be quicker to kill a man with actual grease, the tompson however is capable of 720 no scope cross map one shots (only a slight exaggeration). Another example is the bolt action rifle, its useless at first and is so expensive that it is impracticle to buy it without money, each mod which is needed to turn it into a frikkin laser beam capable of oneshotting anything even with a leg shot (not an exaggeration) each then cost the same as the intial purchace. This is only shadowing one major ♥♥♥♥ up of design, the squad set up. If you want to play with your friends and they are a different class than you, then you are not playing with them simple as. To become a tanker or pilot it now costs around 50,000 ingame credits after todays patch, (that's a lot)  you then need to pay to change back to infantry and if you need to do this then you are going to pay another 50k to become a tanker again... The game still needs a lot of work to be fun to play and whilst maybe 1 in 4 matches are actually fun which strangly seem always fight russians, the other 3 ruin the experiance.\n\nalso pistols and any top end american weapon are BS OP crap.","July 7, 2015","false","14.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Now you can buy your way through the most powerful equipment and the upkeep with reapair and refill ammo is through the roof, you loose money most times you use anything but the standard rifle with stock config, even still you make such a low amount that it pretty muchs requires a premium account to make any sort of progress unless you want to get stuck on basic infatry forever.\n\nThis is coming from a player with pretty much everything in the game, mostly what I got in the last year when the game was fair and fun, and I did buy a lot of stuff with RL money for convenience, but back then it felt fair, now it feels like a straight up money grab.\n\nIt is very sad to see a game with such great potential fall to this path.

What at first appeared to be a quick attempt to throw together dated graphics, and a pay-to-win profit model cloaked in a well used FPS genre, turned out to offer more than my initial reaction gave credit for. While that reaction is harsh, the game does contain dated graphics(eg. 2010), and a profit model that allows paying players to progress more quickly. What Heroes & Generals also offers is solid gameplay, progressive customization, and well balanced maps, all painted in a coat of FPS nostalgia.\n\nWith most free-to-play titles the first thing people criticize is the monetezation features, and this was one of the first areas I investigated. I'm glad to see that Heroes & Generals does a great job of avoiding the pay-to-win pitfall. By making all equipment available for both in game credits, and Gold purchased with real funds, H&G developers made it possible for people, paying or not, to access the same gear, albeit at different times. Monetization features allow players to purchase pre-trained soldiers, increase Credits/Warfunds earned in battles, unlock/purchase equipment/skins, purchase Assault Squads, and unlock 1 extra badge/equipment slots.\n\nOverall Heroes & Generals is a balanced experience, and a game I will continue to play. While at points the game may seem unfair due to people having better equipment than you, it is actually a nice dose of realism, as in war you are not always evenly matched technologically. This game is still in Early Access, so expect minor bugs and glitches, but at this point I've encountered very few. This game is at the perfect point to start playing and becoming active in the community. For the price I highly suggest taking some time to play this game, and develop your own opinions, and if you have suggestions don't hesitate to voice them on the forums, because that's the whole point of the Early Access system.","July 23, 2014","true","174.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

I played nearly 70h but i managed to get only 6th rank. Weapon prices are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ joke (you need to play several hours to get some weapon). Lack of realism and bugs are biggest cancer of this game. PzI and Konigstiger needs the same amount of missiles to destroy them, only difference is armor. You can't destroy tankette with AA gun, when you'll jump to deep water from 4-5m you'll get nearly killed, heaviest tank can be easily destroyed by single mine, distance calibration sometimes doesn't work. Players are mostly ♥♥♥♥ing campers, they are camping at spawn and hunting you down with single shot of their OP rifles. If devs won't repair this game it will be one of the worst WW2 MMOs ever. Better buy RO.\n\nEDIT:\nAfter few updates it is a little better, but still I can't recommend this game. After several months they have added just one map. Every type of terrain has the same map.
