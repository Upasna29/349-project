Extremely well executed plot. Deep, flawed, very loveable, human like characters. Nice art (I'm too dumb to tell more than that). Notable BGM and some very polished minor details. FREE. FREE FREE FREE. Go play it.\n\nWarning though: INTENSE.\n\n\n\nFULL REVIEW:\n\nI went into this game figuring I'd play it a little bit at a time. It looked ok enough, at least.\n\nI marathoned it pretty much in one sitting. Skipped class to do it, too. It's THAT good. Even if you don't like the whole anime subculture, give it a shot. It dodges or parodies a lot of the cliches and presents a deep, thought provoking, and emotionally powerful story. If you DO like the anime subculture, you'll probably like it even more.\n\nThere's so much to be said about it... What a rollercoaster.\n\nVery mild spoilers below; I won't discuss specific events, but I might mention themes and such. Anything I say you can figure out from the description of the game.\n\n\nPLOT:\n\nIt seems like a nice, innocent little setting. High school, cute girls, blah blah slice of life.\n\nIt's not.\n\nThis is not to take away from the first part of the game; I enjoyed it. It was funny. About one third to half way through the story, though the plot gets more and more intense. It transitions from "cute and enjoyable" to "powerful and meaningful."\n\nThe climax is absolute insanity; it's horrifically disturbing yet simultaneously exhilirating, fueled all the more by the sudden influx of decisions you have to make. Everything is connected very logically and coherently, however. It's not some random shift that leaves you scratching your head wondering how you got there. It's an inevitable build up that leaves you both anticipating and dreading your arrival at that point. The contrast between the first and last parts of the game really emphasize a feeling of breakdown.\n\nMore generally, the plot is extremely well constructed and paced. It never felt too fast or too slow, which is probably why it managed to retain my horribly short attention span for such a long period. It flows really well too, where one event easily leads into the next. The actual events of the plot are good, but nothing spectacular, but the way it's executed makes it fantastic.\n\nI loved the whole thing. Laughed like an idiot almost nonstop at the copious wit and comedy, raged at the insanity, cried when appropriate. It's an absolute rollercoaster, but so worth the ride.\n\nFair warning, though. It gets REALLY intense. And it really hurts sometimes. I liked the pain though.\nIf I have any complaint, it's that there were some plot points that I found disatisfying, as a player. I understand why they were made though. That doesn't mean I have to be happy about it. Lucid 9 unappolgetically proposes some very difficult themes and sticks to them. It's a story that has meaning.\n\nThe rest of the game HAS to come or I'll cry for real.\n\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\nMy favorite part of any story. If I don't like the characters, I don't read. Simple as that.\n\nLucid 9 has really, really good characters.\n\nWhile they're obviously based on common anime archetypes, Lucid 9's characters transcend the cliches on which they were born. They're nuanced, fleshed out, very flawed, and so, so lovable. They feel very human and complex, in a way that almost no other anime or game I've seen has managed. You won't always agree with them. Actually, a lot of the time, you probably won't. But they're all the better for it. And most of the time, you'll laugh and cry with them anyways. Just don't try to write yourself into the story or expect them to be perfect. This ain't no utopia.\n\nAlso, the girls are cute. And the guys. So if you don't care about any of the stuff I just spouted, at least there's that.\n\n\nWRITING:\n\nThe writing is super smooth; this is very clearly a game that was originally written in english, not translated. I'm kind of a prose nerd, and some of the phrases gave me chills. The word-art is every bit as well done as the visual-art.\n\nIt's also hilarious and amazingly witty, especially in the beginning. At the end, when everything goes nuts, nothing feels cheesy, which is quite a feat in emotional scenes. I'm a very critical reader, but I had no issues with the writing. 10/10\n\nOh, and Gover Mecher is genius. Funniest satirical parody.\n\n\nART:\n\nIt's pretty. I like it. Sorry, I have the artistic talent of a brick. Go look at the pictures. You'll know if you like it or not.\n\n\nMUSIC:\n\nI don't notice the BGM in most games, but Lucid 9's really stood out to me for some reason. It manages to be catchy and noteworthy without overbearing, enough so that I felt inclined to include it as a seperate section.\n\n\nOTHER:\n\nThere are plenty of little things that make the game feel very polished and add a lot to the atmosphere. Simple things like phone animations, ocassional game-esque overlays, and flashing or faded UI contribute heavily to a scene without being ostentatious. It's not stuff I would have thought of, but there are some scenes that I can't imagine without them.\n\n\nVERDICT:\n\nExcellent game. Deep, provactive, but fun and enjoyable. I read through it in one sitting and I don't even like VNs. Those of you brave souls that DO will probably like it even more.\n\nAlso, it's free. FREE. With far better production value than most commercial stories. You legit have nothing to lose. Except time, I guess. Which most of us will probably waste in worse ways anyways.\n\nDid I mention it's FREE?","April 14","true","8.9"," 61 of 62 people (98%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","98","61","62","9","0"

Your choices will carry varying degrees of impact on the storyline (I'll talk about this later). Even if you're not into anime or visual novesl that much, I highly reccomend this game to you.\n\nHOWEVER the female characters don't have huge personalitities so if you're into those then you won't find them here.\n\n++DIALOGUE\nThe dialogue in this game is fantastic. Yes, there will be some times where you will feel like cringing but overall it really makes the game. The characters actually have a ♥♥♥♥ ton of personality and flavor tips that I found myself cracking up to. Solid 9.5/10\n\n++ART\nNow I'm not an art major or anything but the art in this game is fantastic. The art style isn't too extravagant. Some backgrounds are reused for a few places but overall there is quite a large amount of unique pieces. 8/10\n\n++LENGTH\nPersonally I got around a solid 10 hours of gameplay for my first playthrough. This is with me not using the skip tool, reading 95% of the dialogue (was a bit late a night). I've also spent about 2 hours just going back and choosing different options at different moments just to experience it all. Plus it would be good to mention that there ARE NO MICROTRANSACTIONS WHATSOEVER in order to increase game length, so you get this wonderful experience without digging into your steam wallet/paypal. 9.5/10\n\n+STORY\nThere is a surprising amount of depth and storyline to this free gem of a game. I won't go into details for the sake of saying that YOU NEED TO PLAY THIS GAME FOR YOURSELF. I found myself cheering and stunned at some moments of this game.\n\nHOWEVER\nThe game does leave off with a cliffhanger that gave me mixed feelings. It's nice to know that there'll be another game but at the same time I feel like some people will like the ending to this game a lot more than others. Other than that the only real bashful thing I have to say about this game is that a lot of the decisions you make early on won't effect the end outcome (TO MY LIMITED KNOWLEGE, WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW IF I FIND OUT MORE). A lot of the really important decisions come at the end, and I even had to look up a guide to get the ending I wanted. 7/10 for story.\n\nSHOULD YOU INVEST TIME IN THIS GAME?\n\nplease. At the very least do it for a lone Picklegoose who needs to relate to someone about this game- my heart is just done. This is an emotional rollercoaster of a visual novel that will leave you at the very least happy that you invested your time into it.","April 16","true","13.2"," 45 of 46 people (98%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","98","45","46","7","1"

I’ve paid for games that are far inferior, and still, Lucid9 is free…\n\nBut yeah, this is a great game that we have here! Don’t be fooled by the cute art style; the story is deep and just amazing. I love mystery/horror, so Lucid9 became my favorite free VN on Steam. I can’t wait to play the sequel! I also hope that there will be future DLCs (soundtrack, artbook, etc).\n\nI’d like to thank these developers for creating such a gorgeous game. You guys rock!

Without it, you die!\nLucid9 is like air! Without it, you die!\nLucid9 is like fried chicken! Without it, you die!\n\nIn all seriousness, this game has exceeded my every expectation. Prior to release, I figured that it would be a charming free-to-play with surprisingly good art and music. I did not expect it to be as engaging as it truly is.\n\nThe story is simple but exciting, the characters are interesting and fun, the dialogue is incredibly well written and seriously brings these characters to life. There are also multiple endings that you achieve based on your choices, as expected from a game of this genre. You can really tell that the team involved poured their hearts and souls into the creation of this visual novel, and I have nothing but respect for them.\n\nI've REALLY enjoyed my experience with this game, and I'm so excited for the voice acting patch next year. They've got a really solid cast picked out, and I can't wait to hear the characters' interactions fully voiced. If you're on the fence about giving it a shot, don't be a shackin' dummer. The incredibly steep price tag of $0 might be intimidating, but give it a chance. I promise, you'll be pleasantly surprised.","April 16","true","20.5"," 42 of 49 people (86%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","86","42","49","16","4"

That alone not enough of an impression as to how recommendable this game is? Very well, keep reading!\n\nTHE DIALOGUE IS THE BEST I'VE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. If I were to come out with it thus far, the dialogue is one of the strongest points for this entire visual novel. The balance between comedy and seriousness is very... well, balanced as well as well-written. The dialogue just perhaps IS the strongest point of Lucid9. I have had so many laugh-out-loud moments reading the dialogue as well as shudders of fear because of this dialogue and any and all implications. It's so well-written for each character as well as the protagonist's narration. Even the text messages. Good lord, the text messages.\n\nTHE WRITING OVERALL IS SO VERY DETAILED. I do not think I have been as impressed with writing in a visual novel in my whole life. As mentioned, I believe dialogue to be the strongest thing in Lucid9, but the aforementioned narration of the protagonist is just as amazing with how descriptive it can be. May I add that it never overstays its welcome, either. If there's something funny but fast being commented on, then the response in narration is short, snappy, and funny. If it's serious, you bet it'll switch to longer panel/novel sections to describe it. As aforementioned, I feel the balance is on point. It feels like conversation and thoughts in real life.\n\nTHE CHARACTERS ARE ALL THREE-DIMENSIONAL... DESPITE WHAT YOU MAY THINK FROM APPEARANCES. You may being seeing these cutesy anime waifus and pretty bishounen anime husbandos being like, "ugh, I bet SHE'S gonna be all uguu kawaii desuuuuUUUU," or, "ugh, I bet the protagonist is gonna be ALL ABOUT that harem lifestyle!" No. Please. Please let me tell you that the characters are some of the most three-dimensional that I've ever seen. I can relate to many of the things the protagonist says, and can honestly feel like he... is human. He feels so human. And others around him feel human, too. Also believe me when I say they know what they're talking about here; these writers have knowledge in the cliches and tropes and popular trends of anime, pop culture, technology, and society when considering their characters and their interests, etc; they parody it frequently. (Or at least, I think so). So far, every single character has beat my original impressions based on appearances or introductions alone. I love everyone.\n\nTHE ART IS SOLID AND THE UI IS WELL ORGANIZED, STYLISTIC, AND CONSISTENT. Sprites are very pretty to look at! I prefer the male character art as opposed to the female style in this, but it's definitely right for those who want their cute waifus! The menus already (really, the title) can give off the tone this game wants to set and stays consistent all throughout. These 9 hours I have poored in definitely do stay comedic, but it almost feels like they want you to know what you're getting into. By the time you hit 'start,' you'll have an idea. The in-game menus (save, load, quit, etc.) are also much more effective than your usual visual novel. They are shortened to just icons in the corner of the screen and take up virtually no space so that the writing is put on the spotlight always.\n\nTHE MUSIC AND SOUND IS WELL-COMPOSED, CATCHY, AND VERY ATMOSPHERIC. The music the moment I got into the title screen is good, and again, sets a very specific... tone. The tracks are not too repetitve in my opinion unless your patience is short, and some of the more dramatic tracks are still on my brain right now. I'm no sound effects specialist or anything, but the sound effects are also very good. Please play with headphones on! The sounds of passing footsteps going from ear to ear is honestly lovely to hear as a touch.\n\nTHIS IS A FREE VISUAL NOVEL, BY THE WAY. IT'S FREE, and it goes FAR beyond my expectations for what a free visual novel usually contains. I have not gazed upon such a beauty of a visual novel in a very long time, especially being free. Have I mentioned that it's free?\n\nIF I HAD ONE CRITICISM, it might be the... setting. All of this feels particularly strange being set in Japan. Not that I am against it at all because it does remind you it's Japanese, but it feels so very westernized. I guess that's me just being nitpicky about Japanese names, honorifics, etc that may give those unfamiliar a hard time later on.\n\nEDIT:\nI did not take into consideration at the time of writing that this is supposed to be introductory towards visual novels, meaning good for beginners in the genre, but is as well for seasoned readers. Though my point is still accurate with how westernized it feels, I believe that it is more appropriate that this is westernized for such a cause. IF YOU DISLIKE JAPANESE NAME WESTERNIZATION(?) THEN STEER CLEAR(???).\n\nStill though, please consider trying Lucid9. I have already considered this much beyond a visual novel; I consider Lucid9 an experience.","April 15","true","20.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

The fact is that, even though I thought a relatively passive "visual novel" playstyle was going to bore me, I was engrossed in the story almost from the start.  It's well-written, aside from a few spelling errors here or there (Which initially got me off-side but are, really, quite far and few between), and the character interactions and semi-narration from Yama are fun and, importantly, serve a purpose rather than being inane padding.\n\nThere are some choices throughout that impact your end-game result, of which I have seen several.  Which means you'll get more than one playthrough.  Which is amazing, considering that there is already at least 10-12 hours (It depends on how quickly you read, I guess.) of content on the initial playthrough.  For second time round you are given the handy option of fast-forwarding through what you have already read - in case you just want to explore different paths to the end without going through the entire story bit by bit.\n\nThe story is nothing gripping or earth-shatteringly new, really, but Yama - whose perspective you are reading from - is well thought out and well written, which is good news because you spend almost every moment with him and his thoughts.  Because of his well-written internal dialogue the supporting characters and, thusly, the story itself becomes intriguing and in turn keeps you reading until the very end.\n\nThe background art is simple but effectively conveys setting and the character art is crisp and well-drawn in a typical Manga style which, while nothing new is also not unpleasant.  There is no voice work so it is a hefty amount of reading to put in - perfect for solid or enthusiastic readers although people who need to perhaps be more visually stimulated or distracted by more than just words and simple art may find it difficult to get through the whole thing.\n\nThoroughly enjoyed my first playthrough and looking forward to seeing the different paths each choice leads to on subsequent replays.\n","April 18","true","17.7"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

I love mysteries. You know what I really hate? How VN authors always shove slice of life into mystery stories. The slice of life just inevitably clashes with the heavier tone of a good mystery and lessens the suspense. At least, I used to think that such pitfalls were inevitable before reading Lucid9.\n\nLucid9 takes a while to really get going on the mystery side, instead opting to be predominately lighthearted for the first several hours. Surprisingly though, that actually plays well into the storytelling. In a VN like G-Senjou no Maou, the slice of life scenes, while fun and enjoyable in a vacuum, feel out of place in the larger context of the story. Going from intense crime solving and battles of wits to unconsequential goofy high school funtimes doesn't always work so well.\n\nHowever, Lucid9's brilliantly written slice of life (whose brilliance is largely due to hilarious, snappy dialogue) provides some excellent build-up that heightens the impact of the mystery plot later on. When a character is in danger, you actually care. When it comes time to solve the mystery, you really won't want to point fingers at any of the great characters you've come to love. What I'm getting at here is that the slice of life segments do a great job at creating a cast of likable and believable characters that all tie into the plot very nicely.\n\nOf course, even if the slice of life half of the story is strong, the mystery needs to also be good. And it is! The entire story is peppered with subtle foreshadowing that is hidden in plain sight to keep the mystery "fair" to solve, while also being discrete enough that you likely won't know the answers long before their reveals. That said, a substantial part of the mystery is incomplete, meaning that I obviously can't comment on how the full plot will turn out. The mystery plot threads that were resolved, however, were very satisfactory in just about every way. There are also a couple of really fun interactive "deduction" sequences ala Ace Attorney or Kara no Shoujo that I probably won't soon forget.\n\nThe music and art were both great too, though I wish that some characters like Haru and Shoji had character sprites. They seem a bit too important to not have them. Also, Akira's theme is seriously catchy. A++ on that one.\n\nThis has gone on too long for a Steam review already, but I just wanted to say that I was extremely pleased with the VN and honestly very shocked how high quality it turned out. OELVNs unfortunately don't have the best reputation, and a free one seems even more sketchy (I imagine the full VN will easily be worth the $20-$30 that other SP VNs are going for). I'm so glad to have given it a chance though, and I can't wait for the rest of the routes!","April 17","true","13.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","17","17","0","0"

They were fun, easily distinct characters with their own personalities, flaws, and bonds. I notice that sometimes with a production size this small, typically you see a lot of characters sound like each other, but most of the time I didn't even need to check the name to know which character was talking.\n\nThis would be one of the only kickstarts I would back with all my money if Fallen Snow Studios made one for the rest of the parts.

WHAT A ROLLERCOASTER. sjflkaj;s\n\nAll I could think about this week was Lucid9. I recommended it to everyone I knew who liked the VN genre (and would listen to my ramblings), and have gotten at least one poor soul hooked on this game. I wish more people would listen, though, because this masterpiece deserves so, so, so much more love and attention. <3\n\nI finished it just a few minutes ago, and I am worn out. This game managed to dig through my internal organs, squish them into mush, and leave me to stew here with a broken heart and a liver halfway up my chest. Not a great situation, but somehow... really, really satisfying. I feel like I need a day of napping just to recuperate from the up-and-down emotions I felt throughout my playthrough of this game. I've laughed, felt accomplished (acing that history quiz without once googling anything made me so proud!), been shocked, terrified, disgusted, sad, and extremely affected. Lucid9 manages to deliver a story so well paced and written that it rivals many of the other costly games I've played. I honestly can't believe this gem is free; I would pay for it in a heartbeat, although I must say that it was the price tag that drew me to pick it up in the first place.\n\nAnyway, there's something for everyone in this VN, especially for those who are fans of other VNs, manga, anime, and the like. I'm not a massive enthusiast, and usually can't stand just sitting and clicking, but the story is so engaging that you'll find yourself hard-pressed to close the game and go to bed. With the variety of romance routes, cute girls (and boys), self-referential humour, satire, and lots of tearjerking kmoments, I guarantee something will get to you. The music and art is pretty neat, too, and the assets are arranged in a way that definitely maximises the writing's impact.\n\n* - Side Note: The UI in this game is absolutely gorgeous as well. I'm so glad it was something that was seriously considered in the development, because I hate outdated/clunky menus. Lucid9's everything is so clean and minimal, and I can't thank the devs enough for that, hahaha.\n\nAnd what's more -- love it or hate it, you might as well try it. The developers are angels, honestly, because there's nothing you need to give to play this beautiful game besides your time. And I'm sure it'll be well spent.\n\nGreat work all around, Fallen Snow Studios -- I can't wait to play episode 2. :D","April 22","true","12.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It took a short while to download, so I played it at 10:20.\n\nI didn't read what it was about, I saw anime-styled characters and a school, and I thought it was just a slice of life kind of thing. I thought it would just be a funny game where I didn't have much of an attachment to the characters.\n\nAfter the initial six minutes of getting hooked, I kept playing and didn't keep track of the time. Played until 12:50 AM and went to sleep.\n\nThe next day I played straight for 4 hours. It's very easy to binge.\n\nIt left me in shock, a game where I was experiencing high school in a First World Metropolis? I normally think slice of life's are cheesy, but for some reason this was an emotional rollercoaster unlike some Visual Novels.\n\nThe characters had similar characteristics to many of my friends, I could literally match them to some of the characters.\n\nThe dialogue felt real, it felt as if this wasn't written and it felt as if real people had said it.\n\nThe soundtrack was composed of the same songs, but man oh man they are perfect for the situations they're in. I couldn't have picked better for the scenes.\n\nThe art style may throw those people who think that being a weeaboo is just liking the art off but the art was amazing and I loved it.\n\nThe story is truly amazing, it was easy to understand, was stressful and entertaining, and put me through several stages of emotion.\n\nI went from happy, to sad, to happy, to sad, to even sadder, to nearly crying...\n\nI finished the game, chatting with friends along the way.\n\nAfter I finished I was just like; "Damn, what do I do now..."\n\nThis game gave me an experience no other games could give me. (Other than Undertale, but you have to pay for that.)\n\nI have done an ending I'm not proud of, and I'm too lazy to do any other endings.\n\nPros Good visuals\nAmazing story\nGreat dialogue\nLovable characters\nIt's free, there's no catch Cons There are parts where you want to pick what you do but your character shuts it down and does one option\nMany of the visuals are the same Airi eating peaches even though shes supposed to eat meat\nIf you skip too fast some of the effects clip into other partsI clicked to fast in the drop part of the amusement park and I heard the dropping sound even though I wasn't in that part anymore\n\nTL;DRLucid9 is a work of love. It has lovable characters, amazing dialogue, plenty of scenes, the best story in a visual novel I've played, and it's free.\n\n...\nDid I mention it's free?","April 18","true","9.6"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

We have currently recorded all of day 1 and will resume day 2 sometime this month. Note: I did not read the entirety of the script prior to recording as I wanted the full experience by actually playing the game.\n\nStory: Short and simple. I'm a picky person in regards to storytelling and Lucid9 managed to be one of those stories that did exactly what I wanted and captured me. Smooth writing with clear and concise details and a plot that seems very light-hearted but with a brutal twist as you near the end. Some minor grammar, punctuation etc errors, but that's just a nitpick. Basically, Lucid9's story and storytelling were both captivating and effective.\n\nCharacters: Typical anime tropes with tsunderes, quirky comic reliefs, sarcastic know it alls and more, but with heavy background that isn't explicitly described in detail. I presume they are waiting until post common route to get into individual routes which would more then likely have detailed backgrounds of each character. Still. The characters and their interactions with each other were both colorful and dynamic, assuring my growing love for them.\n\nArt: Need I say more then beautiful? It is very Key-esque, and probably even Key inspired. Very detailed and colorful.\n\nMusic: Always catchy for me. Music is something that is paramount to a good game, movie, anime, etc. This game had music that kept me humming along whenever one I really liked popped up.\n\nVerdict: 9/10 Frankly, Lucid9 is one of the best OELVN's I've played, which is unfortunately not many and I recommend it to everyone. It even managed to keep me awake a full night with no sleep. That should tell you something. I'm excited to be working on the voice acting for the patch, slated to be released next year and will work extra hard to make sure we give you the performace that really brings these characters to life.","April 15","true","24.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Better than a lot of paid visual novels on steam right now. The first part of a bigger story that manages to resolve its central plot line. If you like visual novels, give it a shot.\n\nStory\n\nLucid9 follows Yama Ishimoto, a cynical carefree high student of a prestigious high school in 2018 Japan. All is fine with the world, except  it is swiftly shown that students are going missing. The opening scene quickly shows there's a serial killer involved and the central mystery is established.\n\nInciting Incident is the first part of a larger story and, as such, the romance aspect one may come to expect from visual novels isn't especially present yet. Instead, much of the plot is focused on solving the mystery presented early on, and I believe it has done a good job for this. Yama is neither a super genius or a detective so most of the time he isn't actively trying to solve the puzzle, but the reader, if they stay focused and pay attention, are provided with plenty of clues disguise as typical high school slice-of-life scenes. Having been through the story already, I will say that I believe the mystery is completely fair and can be solved with the information provided directly to the reader.\n\nCharacters\n\nAlong side the mystery plot are the characters. Yama is quickly shown to be rude, self-centered, snarky and judgemental, most likely far from the expected badass/all-loving/idealistic protagonist one may come to expect from most visual novels. A large number of visual novels will focus on developing the heroines rather than the protagonist and it's refreshing to see a visual novel protagonist with potential for character developments. That said, while it is nice to see someone who's not a straight-up nice guy protagonist, Yama can sometimes be a huge unreasonable, judgemental and unapologetic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So while it's good that the character has a lot of room for development (and he does develop here), Yama can also be very hard to stomach, especially when he gets away with being a huge prick to people who are not his friends. This being a first part of a bigger story however means there's still plenty of time for him to grow out of that, something I look forward to seeing.\n\nThen we have the five heroines: Rui, (blatant) tsundere childhood friend, Elizabeth, high-and-mighty straight-laced overachiever, Akira, bubbly and over-energetic friend, Misaki, quirky and carefree childhood friend and Airi, weird emotionless and literal-minded bullied kid. If you're familiar with visual novels or just anime in general, they will all sound incredibly archetypical. Fortunately, the writing proved to be much better than I initially anticipated, and the girls all have hidden depths that, so far, manages to be believable as well as surprising and avoided being broken birds for the protagonist to fix and woo. The same can also be said to the two male friends: Yahiko, the cheerful idiot, and Masato, the hot-headed stubborn musclehead. It is this unexpected depth that especially impressed me and moved me from eye-rolling at the early parts of the plot to being fully invested in the mystery and development of the characters. That said, it should also be mentioned that a lot of the early dialogues, while not indicative of the strength of the writing, can be so filled with constant sarcasm, snarks and wackiness that they can get very insufferable very quickly. Once you get pass that however, there's a lot to love here and the writing as a whole will prove to be much better than the early stages would suggest.\n\nGameplay\n\nLucid9 is a visual novel and come with the sort of gameplay (or whatever you choose to call it) one would expect from the genre. Choices are present. Some are clearly there to let you "earn points" with the respective heroines, some are there for fun, and some are there to test the player's ability to solve the mystery. It is this last set of choices, the one that requires actual deduction, where the game sets itself apart from decision making from more typical visual novels. Of course, considering the mystery questions are boiled down to multiple choice, it removes some of the inherent logic and difficulty in deduction, but nonetheless these sequences are fun brain teasers. That said, there's one sequence late in the game filled with bad ends that most players would likely fail at more than once. The bad ends themselves can be surprising, but they are also very contrived and out of nowhere. This section, I believe, is especially unfair and the trial-and-error that may be required to get through really hampers the tension intended here.\n\nArt and Music\n\nVisually, the game is adequate. It's not the best looking visual novels out there and it's not the worst either. Character designs aren't the best, though that may just be my personal preference, but backgrounds and UI look pretty good for a non-commercial production. The soundtracks serve their purpose and while not many stand out to me personally, there are one or two (especially one used in the ending) that I found very impressive and fitting. At the time of writing, the game has no voice acting. However, the developer promises a free voice patch in the future and samples can be found on the game's website.\n\nConclusion\n\nInciting Incident, while a first part of a larger story, manages to conclude its driving mystery while leaving plenty of questions up in the air for the latter parts. That said, the story does end in such a way that more or less demand an immediate follow-up. This coupled with the future voice patch means that right now is perhaps not the best time to start. However, if I am to judge what is present right now on its own merit, I'd say the game is definitely worth getting (and come on it's free). The surprisingly well-written characters and the intriguing and fair mystery sets this above a lot of other paid visual novels and I'd definitely recommend it for any fan of the genre.","April 17","true","12.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Has some really witty dialogue and references to other media (look out for the Princess Peach joke, 10/10) and is consistently funny throughout at least the first half, before things get a bit more serious. Doesn't necessarily stick to the tropes and feels fleshed out. The writer/s are astonishingly good (I read that one writer completed ~95% of it but only recently quit? Slightly worrying considering how good the writing here was. Hopefully the majority of it for the rest of the novel has been completed already). If the future episodes can keep up to this standard of writing then they'll be well worth your time (and money if they start charging for it).\n\nApologies for the incoherence, I stayed up way too late to finish this after regretting sleeping at all when halfway through last night.\n\nMinor spoiler:\n\nI really hate the ending.

Set in the near future of 2018, you have your highly intelligent but seemingly lazy, cynical and snarky male protagonist. You also have the female childhood friend love interest who stuck up for him in the past, helped him get through some past trauma and essentially stick to him like glue his entire life, whilst never actually confessing to him. You even have childhood friend number two, the female transfer student, and let's not forget the protagonist's male allies either;  the apparently aloof, warm-hearted and kind womanizing support character number 1, and support character number 2, the jock (although in his defence his grades are superb). Oh and of course the first female childhood friend has a female friend support character trying to match make the protagonist despite also having feel-\nOk, so you get the idea. As one of the characters say, the protagonist's school life seems like the perfect set up for a 'really crap anime'.\nThankfully, it is anything but.\nDespite the initial setup that might send warning signs of a 'cliche', 'boring' or 'generic' environment, the witty dialogue, references, memes and humorous character chemistry create a thoroughly entertaining and amusing experience. The dialogue is spectacular, which is probably partially due to the fact this is an original English story, but to the writers' credit, I'm still surprised by how good the dialogue is.  As you can probably tell, I really enjoyed this section of the game; the protagonist's snarky attitude reminded me of Yuuji from Grisaia with his internal dialogues, and the cutesy art and music meshed together pretty well to create a fun slice of life RomCom.\nExcept, of course, that's not what this VN is about. Or at least that's not the main driving force behind the plot. Even throughout this happy-go-lucky style of plot, there is an undercurrent of a darker, more mysterious and dangerous force at work, just in case you didn't notice from the store page screaming murder and mystery at you. And this is where the story really picks up and becomes more about the mystery, murder and detective aspect rather than the high school life of an ordinary student. We see more about the tragic past of the protagonist and his friends, and more foreboding of the murderer's intentions with the chilling music emphasizing the danger as we attempt to deduce who it is. However,  despite the transition into the faster paced plot driven 2nd half of the VN, the focus of the original story is never lost. That is to say, even with all the events in the plot building up climatically to the final showdown, there is always a focus on the main character, his relationships, his past and how he'll change for the better, which I think is a pretty good thing. Because if I had to pick one aspect of the game as a whole that I like the most I'd have to say the characters. Despite what I said about them coming off as generic and cliche at the start of the game, they develop and become fleshed-out, and they seem, believe it or not, human. Which is actually a big deal. They become relatable and pretty damn loveable, which is why they're my favourite part of Lucid9.\nWhat impresses me the most though is the fact that this is done without any monetary support. To be frank, I was expecting the lack of monetary funding to result in compromises whether it be in the technical elements like the settings/menu options or in the quality of the writing/art/music. But the art style fits the tone, the UI is polished and almost 40 tracks accompany the novel throughout, from the 'nostalgic emotional memory' feel to the 'imminent boss fight' feel, which really does enhance the effect of whatever may be going in the story at that time. For me, I usually place a lot more importance on the writing and art than anything else, but when all the other bits and pieces work, even I can appreciate what a difference they make to the overall quality.\nAnother technical element worth highlighting is the choice system, and the interactive aspect of the game in general. Some of the choices give access to new comedic scenes, CG arts or achievements but some of the others are more serious, dictating whether you reach the bad or 'true/good' end. I think a nice balance between difficulty and importance is achieved as a result, because it's pretty easy to either create meaningless choices or give options to a problem that is too tedious to solve by mistake. The few logic puzzles are an enjoyable aspect as they change the pace a bit and force you to think, but at the same time they're definitely accessible, and if you choose the wrong answer or the joke answer you're easily forgiven too. I'm eager to see more of them in the future since I suspect they will become more common in the individual heroine routes when the fundamental mystery plot is actually revealed.\nI suppose the one gripe I have is that a technical feature that I think could be implemented is missing; a skip to the next choice feature, mostly for replaying + achievement/cg hunting. Personally I've never been that much of an achievement collector but I admit I get curious if I see a bunch of hidden achievements and missing CG art, enough to want to select the choices I didn't choose last time and see what happens. A skip to the next choice feature would help in that regard, rather than just using the ordinary skip function whilst making a lot of save points at all the choices.\nOverall though, I'm pretty damn impressed by Lucid9. I'll definitely be looking forward to both the voice patch and the heroine route patch, since this is only the beginning after all. This is easily in my top 6 VNs, and to be honest, if you've gotten this far in the review and still aren't sure whether to try it or not, just do it. It's free after all.","April 15","true","25.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I apologize for both.\nNow honestly, I knew nothing about Lucid9 when I saw it here. I was looking for free games, I saw it, and I downloaded it simply because I had nothing better to do. Visual Novels were a game genre I had never really played much of, and as a result I both didnt know what to expect and didnt expect much, seeing it as "another anime game". I enjoy anime and am a huge hypocrite for saying that, but I digress. Anyway, when I started it up I was initially confused but intrigued, which was enough to draw me in. The characters made me laugh and reminded me of my own friends, and so I began the game thinking it simple, but nothing that could hold me. And then I slowly got more and more engrossed. I met Shigure an actually thought out what I was going to say, I did my best to not cheat on her "test" (besides that horse question, screw that one. Good on you guys though) and I really liked the mystery feel I got from the game. Yama himself was probably what kept me tied, as he reminded me a lot of myself, Sarcastic, believing school to be a waste of time, the "weird kid" with few but close friends. It felt nice to have a character to relate to. Yahiko's optimism and oblivious personality made me laugh, Masato continued to impress and surpise me with, completely betraying the typical "jock" feel I initially got from him. And then it got serious. With the murders, the investigations, this happy game (well, novel) I was once playing (well, reading) turned into a much more serious and thought provoking game, especially when characters like Mr. Ryouta and Airi were involved. Without spoiling it, I went through a LOT of bad ends, looking for my happy ending, before I eventually realized that I wasn't SUPPOSED to get a completely satisfying ending. I repreatedly fought the killer, and a certain someone repeatedly died. It wasn't until I made it past the ordeal that I realized I got my happy ending, just not the way I wanted. And then the ACTUAL ending came, and holy balls. I felt angry, confused, betrayed, wanting more...and I can't wait for the next part of this. Lucid9 impressed me repeatedly with both it's lighthearted moments and the more serious one, its dumb seemingly meaningless questions and phrases a huge part of the plot, the psychological questions and detective games forcing me to think and really immerse myself into this amazing game. Seriously, it might not mean much coming from a guy sitting on his computer, typing on a keyboard, but good on you guys, you have made one of the most unique experiences I've ever,,,experienced (couldnt think of  a better word) in a game (again, well novel). If you're on the fence about buying this game, go for it. Well, its also free, so also nothing to lose...but ignoring that fact, this game will draw you in and really make you think and become attached to its amazing characters and think about its story. Again, sorry about being disorganized and lenghy, but alot to say, might as well say it. Can't wait for the next part guys, this is amazing. To shorten it up: GET THIS GAME/VISUAL NOVEL ITS GREAT.","April 25","true","13.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

I just generally feel it's a waste of time.\nBut Lucid9 is an amazing story, and I feel the need to say something. Both so that other people might pick up the experience, and as I way of showing the developers appreciation for a wonderful, free experience.\nWith psychological and mystery elements, as well as romance, drama, and comedy. It really seems to have it all. I feel like it delivers on all fronts, (with the exception of in-depth romance, which I read harem routes and a progression to the main story would come later) and is all-in-all an indepth story which is easily bingable.\n\nI started this at 10pm, didn't get to bed until 7am, didn't finish reading the good ending until the next day.\nWhen you get into Lucidy9, you'll find yourself pointing fingers at the characters, seeking out hints behind the mystery, and all the while pushing your character into the arms of your chosen waifu and aborsbing yourself in the drama, past, and daily life of the main character Yama.\nThis VN easily plays as a psychological mystery horror, romance, comedy, and still manages to tie all of its many characteristics rather perfectly.\nWhen you finish this VN, you'll feel joy, you'll feel truimph, and ultimately, you'll feel sadness.\n\nIf you want to feel the familiar feels of a good book, or vn, or anime, or whatever stimulates your feels, this is a very good option.\n\nAnd just a tip;\nthe best ending is a little hard to get. In the ending sequence, what you need to do is particularly specific. I suggest checking out the the discussions.","April 17","true","20.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At their best, they tend to be rough around the edges and at their worst, they can be downright terrible. Lucid9 bucks this trend and shows a high level of polish all around.\n\nThe overall story is great and keeps you on your toes throughout. It's definitely a story that draws you in and makes you want to see "just one more scene" in the wee hours of the night. The main cast of characters are all likable and have their own unique personalities. While there are some typical anime tropes thrown in, the characters show a remarkable amount of depth that makes the story that much more interesting. Both the music and the visuals are above average considering the price point.\n\nThis game is a good starter point for those that were interested in trying out a VN and don't know where to start. Even for those who have read a few VNs in the past, I consider this a must-read.\n\nOne word of warning to those interested: this game's story is still in development and leaves off on a massive cliffhanger. The developers are working on the next chapter of Lucid9 and will be releasing it, hopefully, in the near future. I am definitely one of the many who are earnestly awaiting the release of the next chapter!","May 14","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But what I recieved was more then I've expected.\n\nHonestly after playing this game, like most other people, I agree that I would have payed for this game. The fact that a game that so thought out and hard worked on is free, honestly leaves me slightly upset. In fact I would've rather spent $60 on this game then any other game I've ever bought in my 12 years of gaming, regardless of the fact that it is 'only' a visual novel.\n\nBut more about the game:\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is how masterfully fluid the game felt. The first bit everthing was a blur, not paying much attention to the subtle things that all came back when it mattered. But as I played longer and felt myself getting more immersed, it was hard not to remember everthing. I realized everything I did, learned and 'saw' was more important then I possibly could have imagined. But in the end I feel like I did more than play a game.\n\nFor Example, meeting multipe indepth characters that not only I could relate to, but could empathize with. I not only meet and felt for these charaters but came to care for them, which is rare to find in games now-a-adays. Just throwing people into a game and telling some background on them doesn't mean there's a connection. How quickly the characters in this game got to me was amazing.\n\nI also personally love the music. The way every scene has a specific piece and how it set the mood for who's talking or what's about to happen. There isn't much else to say about it other that.\n\nBut to sum up the game, it's one I won't be forgetting, in a good way. I haven't played my other visual novels but I feel it was that opened me up more to the catagory. And I have this game to thank for the many, many more VNs I see myself playing in the future.\n\nIf you haven't played the game and want to, I highly suggest not looking at this next comment.

I got emotionally attatched to all the characters in the beginning, and I regretted it later on when I couldn't stop crying when stuff went down.. The graphics were amazing, and I loved the extra scenes. I loved the music; it was amazing at conveying the mood and sometimes making me anxious. It was very well-written.\n\nThe only thing I didn't like was that I couldn't flirt with Yahiko or Masato (I love Masato... Please don't kill him). It would be nice if that could be added. It would also be cool if there were some LGBT characters (I totally ship Elizabeth and Misaki). It just gets a bit annoying when all the books (or visual novels) I read are just straight straight straight.  I like diversity in books.\n\nThe game totally got me with Ryouta. I really liked his character and didn't expect it at all. It made me cry.. multiple times, but thats how you know you've written something well..\n\nAnyways, I would totally recomend this vn and am looking forward for updates!","May 7","true","17.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

All the positive reviews sure made it seem that way. But, to me, it feels like I've wasted my time. The beginning was excusible. I believed it was great foreshadowing of what could happen, according to the game description. From there, everything seemed perfect. I felt like I bonded with the characters, I actually felt like I related to the main character more than most VNs. I took more time with it than I did most VNs, as I was enjoying it very thoroughly. The story felt smooth, and remained that way until the final 5-10 minutes of the game. At that point, there is such a MAJOR plot twist that many people couldn't handle (hence, the "feels" reviews.) And although it seemed cool, the story lost a third of my interest I previously had. But what had to be the final 30 seconds to a minute COMPLETELY RUINED IT. It has made my opinion of Mass Effect 3's ending seem like it was a masterpiece. A minor "spoiler":  THERE IS NO GOOD ENDING!  Not going to talk about the ending but, if you don't mind hating this, by all means, play for the bad ending.","April 29","false","13.1"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","11","0","1"

I feel that area could have been done a bit better, and the hard-to-thread web of choices during it does suck some of the immediacy out of the climax.\n\nContent includes some pretty horrifying material, at times - which is further thrown into contrast by the lighter, more everyday scenes. That contrast serves to increase the impact. If you've a sensitive disposition, you should take care to pace yourself some.\n\nWhile this is a first part, and not a whole, story progression is solid. Think of it as the first season of a TV series. Arcs are started and completed, but there's still more to carry on with at the end.\n\nAll in all, though, an excellent effort that should keep you going for a dozen hours, at minimum.","April 23","true","13.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The backgrounds are really well done and sets the mood perfectly for the different scenarios in the story. The charecter art is Awsome! Showing the unique aspects of each character. small critique is that some of the perspectives make the characters look a little wonky and the ingame portraits seem more sketchy than the full screenshot pictures. But its really good and does not distract from the story at all ^^. BTW The menus and UI and the PHONE is Really cool and I mean Really cool.\n\nWriting: S+\nThis is one of the best stories I have ever read. The charecters are real and life like. It's actually really scary how accurate they are when describing what its like to be inside the head of a depressed person. The characters are real people and you learn to know their motivations and backstory and love them to bits. So when the going gets tough it really tugs and the heartstrings. Also those royalty free names tho! ^^. AND THE REFERENCES!\n\nOST: SS+\nTHIS OST IS AMAZING. Each theme really captures each characters personality and adds a new level of depth to the story. It makes you feel sick when you should feel sick, It makes you feel relived when you should feel relived. Its comforting when you need comfort. It makes you cringe at the most cringiest moments in the story. Its just so good I can't put it into words. Even though the themes loop, it never seems repetetive or annoying. Until you get to a certain part of the story but I won't say anything 'cause spoilers. If you guys release the ost for mp3 let me know ^^\n\nSpecial Effects: S\nThe way the screen flashes properly showing you what the protagonist is feeling is a really nice touch. The realistic sounds that you would hear from white noise to the vibration and dail tone of a phone are all top notch.\n\nOVERALL: It's really good. LIke REALLY GOOD! It is really fun, meeting all these real life like characters is a treat, and I thouroughly enjoyed it.

I assure you this far from that, assuming you have the basic cognitive functions I would expect from a chimpanzee. I wouldn't considered myself an expert on VN's but this Visual Novel most definitely has more substance than some of the ones I've played...or is it read?Who cares.\n\nThe sprites are exceptional quality and add to the various scenes in here. The characters are unique in their own right, seemingly one dimensional characters abiding by overused stereotypes become diverse characters each with their own quirks and personality. As an aspiring writer I can appreciate the authors tone as well as the imagery choreographed into the intense and immersive dialogue and narrative. And most of all, it gives choice. Of course we will go down the plot but the choices you make allow you to learn about this exciting world brought to life as well as it's characters.\nThough my ratings aren't that important it would appeasing to the skim readers out there to see this:\n\nPlot: 10/10\nCharacter sprites: 8/10\nDialogue: 10/10\nCharacter Development: 9/10\nGrammar: 10/10 (I have yet to see one mistake)\nAudio :10/10(No obnoxious elevator music or static)\nBackground Music: 10/10(Used effectively to set a certain mood... I got all the OST's on my phone)\nPacing: 10/10( The story doesn't feel rushed in the least and it progresses at a reasonable pace)\nTone: 10/10 ( The character's voice isn't cliche and is rather relaxing in the text. It even feels a bit relatable to be honest)\nChoices: 10/10\nCharacter Voice: 10/10 (Each character has a unique way of speaking and thinking and their personalities become prominent within the dialogue.)\nWorldbuilding: 10/10 ( Of course it may seem to some that the setting is rather vague but it does so to keep you engaged. The VN tells you what you need to know while leaving you in the dark about a few things. Things which you can learn via the narrative or dialogue,,,and maybe intuition if you actually have the critical thinking skills required to make logical deductions.)\nConnection to characters?(Mind you this is a person opinion. I felt fairly connected to each of them. They all had their own unique sides to them. Keep in mind that each of the characters had their own INDIVIDUAL person to create them. It wasn't just one or two goofs who created the whole cast. It was an army of them. Apparently skilled individuals in their own right and it showed in the final product that is Lucid9.)\n\nAm I shamelessly promoting them and do I work for them? Nope, I wish I did, then I'd have something to brag about to my extremely small social circle. Am I promoting them? You're the genius go figure that one out.\nOne a side note: The person I felt that I would have an easy time hanging out with is Airi. Socially awkward, sure but, she's one hell of a character. Top waifu for sure in my books.\nI won't spoil anything so go and enjoy or hate Lucid9. If you have the time to read this whole essay of pretty words and such then you probably have the time to play (or read) Lucid9.\n~Black Hat Detective\n\n\n","April 25","true","15.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Characters were all interesting in their own perspectives, especially how I am able to somewhat connect my own personality/thoughts to certain aspects of characters or how some of my friends are almost exactly the same as a character.\n\nThe art style to portray the characters and background were also really well done.  Might be a little bias on this since I absolutely love anime and anime art styles but who cares.  Its awesome is all that matters.\n\nThe audio/BGM suits each scene perfectly, noticed on the store page that the devs are planning to add voices in an upcoming patch some time which if it all goes well would leave me happily to replay the game again depending on how I like the voices.\n\n\nOnly downside Ive seen so far is lack of a log/back feature incase you accidentally skip over something  and not necessarily a downside  but this can be one hell of an emotional ride if you get attached to a certain character.\n\n*Keep in mind this is a Visual Novel, if you dont know what that is, google is just a few clicks away\n\nITS FREE!!!

I always thought I would get bored reading these. But I had played a few simple text based games that made me cry. The reviews on here said it was pretty emotional, so I decided to try it out. Now Im depressed because things didnt go the way I wanted in a virtual world.\n\nI've always loved those books and shows that played with your emotions. The ones that really made you care for the characters and their safety. This VN seems to go way beyond those shows and books. I cared about a couple of virtual characters as if they were my friends.  Lucid9 really likes to mess with your emotions, I went from crying to being happy that everyone was okay and everything was going to go as planned, to crying again in matter of minutes. It gets you immersed in the story and makes you care, then it takes that away and does exactly what you didn't want.\n\nI had a hard time quiting. I stayed up late playing for hours, you constantly want to see what happens next and you start to enjoy the moments when you aren't worried about what could be happening to your friend.\n\nPlus, ITS FREE!\nSo even if you have never tried a VN before, please give this one a try. And i dont mean play the first 10 minutes then leave, actually play for a good hour or so. If you decide you hate it, you can delete it and move on, no big deal.\n\n","April 28","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game leaves a uneasy feeling but you felt it coming on all along. It's like you know a series you've been binge watching is nearing its final episodes. You just feel like it can't be over, why is it over! but you know if it was to continue it wouldnt do it justice.\n\nThis is my first VN i've played. I'd say its left me with high expectations. I loved the anime version of Higurashi, but i love this Vn even more than that series and the VN for higurashi just bores me.\n\nThe "gameplay" where you must select the correct answers to questions were thrilling, I felt a sense of achievement and like i was an actual detective as the story progressed. The visual part of the game is not perfect but i was more into the story then the visual part but if you fancy that kinda thing its not bad but definitely not anything special, I will say *spoiler* the flashback scenes and relapses definitely add to the Visual part, i was looking so closely to try to catch a glimpse of what the image was and piece things together. The characters are all interesting and they all definitely get their chance to shine, some characters get a bigger backstory than others but all in all I would definitely recommened taking your time and talking to all of them and not skipping over a chance to.\n\nFYI, If you dont like the darker side of VN and just want that Slice of life stuff this VN is not for you.\n\n\nOverall i give this VN a 9/10\n\nI will absolutely be playing again for different routes and when the voice acting is added in. :)\n\n\n","April 20","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I had fun unlocking every achievment, but I have two complaints; one, there was so much fluff that the first time around, it took about five hours to get through the story, and that's me speedreading. Second, there weren't as many endings as I would have liked, and ulitametly, you're left with either a "bad ending" or some bs to-be-continued. Your choices ultimately don't affect the story all that much, but it's nice to just read through and ejoy it. If you're looking for a game that is honestly affected by your choices, this isn't the game for you. But if you're looking for an interesting story with an intruiging mystery, then go for it! 7/10","April 30","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You take on the role of Yama Ishimoto, A Third Year Highschool student attending a prestigious highschool, 10 days prior to "D-Day".\n\nDuring the story, you have choices to make, like most, these can greatly effect the outcome, whether for better, or for worse. It's pretty slow at first, with moments that will keep you entertained until the last four days when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. By the way, you have the true ending once you hit a "To Be Continued" screen, as the devs are currently working on the second arc, there is no set date for release. They are also adding a Voice patch sometime in 2017.\n\nMy final thoughts, I highly recommend it, it is a free VN that the devs have put their blood, sweat, and tears into, and it shows, there are no pay walls that you'd get with other F2P games, it is 100% free as of currently. I say well done Fallen Snow Studios, I thank you for making such an amazing story such as Lucid9, and marking it has free for everyone to enjoy.\n\n10/10","April 25","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But since this one was free and actually got my attention, I gave it a shot.\n\nLucid9 was an interesting experience that mixed the slice of life and mystery genre among others. It may look all cutesy and innocent sometimes, but trust me, it's far from it. It can switch from being light-heartedly comedic to darkly serious pretty quickly as you advance through the story.\n\nYou got your typical anime characters with their typical anime looks and typical anime personalities. But the thing that's not so typical, is the execution. Normally cliches would be a huge turnoff for some, but perhaps if executed correctly, it works so well that you actually grow attached to the characters.\n\nHonestly, there's not a whole lot that I can say that hasn't been covered already.\n\nYou are given choices that may or may not affect the whole story, but don't throw everything away because of that.\n\nBad things can and will happen.\n\nYou will learn how quickly anything precious to you can be taken away at an instant.\n\nYou may like or dislike the characters, but you should perhaps sit down and listen; they all got a story to tell you.\n\nAnd when you finish the story, you'll just want to say "Damn it all!"\n\n*Mild Spoiler*\n\nBut just as when you thought it ends there, you find out it's only just the beginning.\n\n\n\nLike I said, give it a try.

If you decide to try this VN out, make sure you actually read the dialog and don't quit just a few hours in to fully absorb the greatness that is Lucid9.\n\nThis in-depth review is as spoiler free as possible.\n\nPLOT: 10/10\nThe first few minutes of the game make you feel like this will be your average visual novel where you choose between different girls and end up dating one of them at the end. Just your normal fluffy waifu simulator. But as the story progresses, the plot goes deeper than you would think.\n\nEven though I was enjoying the light theme of the story at the beginning, I almost stopped playing because I thought that it would only go up to that. Boy, was I glad I didn't stop. This VN is intense, with you trying to make ends meet in your mind as to what is actually happening. If you're reading this, I advise you NOT TO STOP just a few hours in. You won't be able to grasp how well written this story is. But then again, if you're only looking for that fluffy otome style VN, maybe you should turn away.\n\nCHARACTERS: 10/10\nI loved the characters in this game. VNs usually only focus on the main girl you are aiming for. This game, on the other hand, lets you get to know all of the characters fairly, as long as you take the time to hang out with them of course. Each character has their own personalities and quirks that make them different from one another. Your relationships with them span from typical childhood friend to idiotic-but-lovable classmate, making your interactions with each of them different.\n\nWRITING: 9/10\nThe writing was exquisite. Each character also had their own way of speaking and texting, with varying degrees in their vocabularies. I also loved the details put into this game. By the time you reach the climax, those minor details that you brushed off as insignificant all come flooding back. Those minor bits of foreshadowing all clump together to paint the entire picture. Just lovely.\n\nART: 8/10\nIt's your typical anime styled visual novel. It's clean, and the variety of expressions on the characters were good. The backgrounds were pretty as well. The small details like the characters zooming in when speaking worked really well.\n\nMUSIC: 8/10\nThe background music really ties the feel of the scenes together. It's a great way to set the mood. Happy music for light-hearted scenes, and more solemn music for the more serious parts. Here's hoping that the future voice acting patch helps bring everything together as well.\n\nOVERALL: 9/10\nVery enjoyable, and easy to get hooked on. I can proudly say that my hours spent playing this VN have not gone to waste, especially for a free game. If you have even just a few hours of spare time, I highly recommend giving this game a shot.\nP.S. I enjoyed the various easter eggs and shoutouts to different games. It made me feel that much closer to the characters.","May 6","true","18.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The happy moments were very light-hearted and serious moments were very intense. The music was beautiful. The only issues I had with it was that the body anatomies were a little off and the grammar could be improved on but it's free so I don't mind those.","May 6","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The backgrounds are really well done and sets the mood perfectly for the different scenarios in the story. The charecter art is Awsome! Showing the unique aspects of each character. small critique is that some of the perspectives make the characters look a little wonky and the ingame portraits seem more sketchy than the full screenshot pictures. But its really good and does not distract from the story at all ^^. BTW The menus and UI and the PHONE is Really cool and I mean Really cool.\n\nWriting: S+\nThis is one of the best stories I have ever read. The charecters are real and life like. It's actually really scary how accurate they are when describing what its like to be inside the head of a depressed person. The characters are real people and you learn to know their motivations and backstory and love them to bits. So when the going gets tough it really tugs and the heartstrings. Also those royalty free names tho! ^^. AND THE REFERENCES!\n\nOST: SS+\nTHIS OST IS AMAZING. Each theme really captures each characters personality and adds a new level of depth to the story. It makes you feel sick when you should feel sick, It makes you feel relived when you should feel relived. Its comforting when you need comfort. It makes you cringe at the most cringiest moments in the story. Its just so good I can't put it into words. Even though the themes loop, it never seems repetetive or annoying. Until you get to a certain part of the story but I won't say anything 'cause spoilers. If you guys release the ost for mp3 let me know ^^\n\nSpecial Effects: S\nThe way the screen flashes properly showing you what the protagonist is feeling is a really nice touch. The realistic sounds that you would hear from white noise to the vibration and dail tone of a phone are all top notch.\n\nOVERALL: It's really good. LIke REALLY GOOD! It is really fun, meeting all these real life like characters is a treat, and I thouroughly enjoyed it. (BTW where do I send the bill for my broken kokoro? :p)","April 24","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

HHHEEELLLLLLLL YYYYEEAAAHHHH!!!\n\n\n\n\nDont usually find Visual Novels very interesting but dayum, first thoughts was its just going to end up like most of the free visual novels on steam that Ive had a look at, download, give a go for a few hours and then uninstall.\n\nHowever, this was different, the story was straight up amazing and had me hooked within no time.  Characters were all interesting in their own perspectives, especially how I am able to somewhat connect my own personality/thoughts to certain aspects of characters or how some of my friends are almost exactly the same as a character.\n\nThe art style to portray the characters and background were also really well done.  Might be a little bias on this since I absolutely love anime and anime art styles but who cares.  Its awesome is all that matters.\n\nThe audio/BGM suits each scene perfectly, noticed on the store page that the devs are planning to add voices in an upcoming patch some time which if it all goes well would leave me happily to replay the game again depending on how I like the voices.\n\n\nOnly downside Ive seen so far is lack of a log/back feature incase you accidentally skip over something  and not necessarily a downside  but this can be one hell of an emotional ride if you get attached to a certain character.\n\n*Keep in mind this is a Visual Novel, if you dont know what that is, google is just a few clicks away\n\nITS FREE!!! Really looking forward for when the second arc is released","April 25","true","15.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

If that's the case my friend, turn away now.\nThe game starts with an interesting scene, but after that there's a rather long and boring part of getting to know all the characters, what they're like and so on. Later on the game will pretty much throw all of that in the trash and kick you in the nuts. The plottwists are real in this one. Get ready to get  utterly destroyed  because  you can't save Rui, your lovely, cheery and overall admirable childhood-friend. No matter what, she'll die one way or another in the end, by your or someone else's hand. Sorry.  The story takes a turn that I didn't expect at all, and I was pretty impressed with that because I thought I would guess the train of event even before the game is halfway through.\nThe ending(s) is the only thing that I dislike about the game, because  the character thar I personally cared about by far the most just simply cannot survive. Even when you think everything's fine  she will die. Period.   The so-called "good ending", I'm looking at you... There should be something that feels like you made ALL of the right choices. But sadly, not here. Maybe it's for allowing the story to progress.\nAll in all, this is amazing. Possibly the best VN I have ever played.

There are a lot of awful VNs on Steam. Why would this one be different?

I was shocked. At some point all those things crumbled and I was thoroughly immersed. I grew to like every character, even the ones I especially expected to hate.

I decided to take a break and finish it the next day.\n\nAnd I once again got absolutely stuck reading it to completion without a break.

This is the third Visual Novel I've played recently. I had stayed away from them for some reason, but now I'm glad I actually took the time to check them out. What I like about this game are the choices. Some Visual Novels won't give you any and some of the others that do, their choices mean little. That's why I've stayed away from these games. But the choices in this game matter. You can't get every achievement in one playthrough which is good, too. It'd be boring if you could gain it all at once. I like how different things happen depending on your choice and what you do.\n\nI enjoyed the story of the game as well. It was confusing when points of view shifted at first, but I understood it once I looked at the corner of my screen and saw the different color. A nice murder mystery with romantic and psychologic elements in it... Overall a great story.\n\nIf I had one bad thing about it, though... I was a little sad at the ending. Not in a bad way. It was a good ending, it's just... Yeah, I didn't want it to end like that. Also, I wish that I could have seen a few more images of my character. Not saying that I wanted Yama plastered everywhere, but a few more shots of him would have been nice.\n\nFor a free game, I'd say that it's long enough. Especially with all of the achievements you have to get. Great job putting it together and good luck on your continued work on the voiced patch! Can't wait to play that version of the game!","May 31","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, the dialogue, the characters... it's all perfect. For a relatively short visual novel, it's amazing how the writers were able to flesh out every character and give them unique depth, unlike two-dimensional characters based off common anime tropes in games such as Danganronpa and Fire Emblem. The game took me about 6 hours for my first playthrough, but it was too good not to play more than once. And it was definitely worth it; playing through the game a second, I understood what was going on a lot better, picked up on new details I'd missed before, and chose different options to see other scenes.\n\nFor a visual novel, Lucid9: Inciting Incident is near flawless. There are a few minor flaws, one being a pacing issue at a certain point in the game, and the other being a sudden shift in how the game works at the end, which could easily frustrate players if they haven't been keeping multiple copies of their save files (which I advise you to do if you play this game).\n\nBut apart from those, Lucid9 is a spectacular game, and I must applaud the amazing people who managed to make everything for this game, including the overarching story, the dialogue, the art, and the fantastic music. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who even remotely enjoys a good story.","May 14","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I found myself actually laughing with the characters at times and I was even panicking at times with them. I found myself deeply involved and pulled in to the store, and it is for that very reason that I do struggle to recommend this game. I reached the "To Be Continued" and I honestly feel like I died inside. I need more and I was absolutely at a loss to be left at such a cliff hanger.

I started playing a bit and immediately was hooked by the lively, very fleshy(human), characters. Going through the story, even though a large amount of the beginning was quiet ordinary, was incredibly enjoyable. You'll hate characters, love characters, or ignore them entirely, but this game manages to make these great characters. After playing this game, I honestly would have paid money to play it. And guess what? It's free.","May 17","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having finished the game, I feel that the game was amazing and good enough to  compete with other more well known visual novels. Style-wise, the art was well done and clear  but not super awesome quality/overly elaborate. However, where Lucid9 shines is in its story. Unfortunately, at this time it seems you can't really pick an individual heroine and go for her just yet, but this doesn't affect the experience. The music fits the scenes and the user interface was smooth and felt very polished.\n\nOverall, Lucid9 is a great visual novel worth playing (even though its free, the quality is good enough to rank with good paid visual novels). I recommend it to anyone interested in visual novels or is on the fence about playing this.\n\nNow, I'm just looking forward to the next sequel for this game :)","May 17","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the third Visual Novel I've played recently. I had stayed away from them for some reason, but now I'm glad I actually took the time to check them out. What I like about this game are the choices. Some Visual Novels won't give you any and some of the others that do, their choices mean little. That's why I've stayed away from these games. But the choices in this game matter. You can't get every achievement in one playthrough which is good, too. It'd be boring if you could gain it all at once. I like how different things happen depending on your choice and what you do.\n\nI enjoyed the story of the game as well. It was confusing when points of view shifted at first, but I understood it once I looked at the corner of my screen and saw the different color. A nice murder mystery with romantic and psychologic elements in it... Overall a great story.\n\nIf I had one bad thing about it, though... I was a little sad at the ending. Not in a bad way. It was a good ending, it's just... Yeah, I didn't want it to end like that. Also, I wish that I could have seen a few more images of my character. Not saying that I wanted Yama plastered everywhere, but a few more shots of him would have been nice.\n\nFor a free game, I'd say that it's long enough. Especially with all of the achievements you have to get. Great job putting it together and good luck on your continued work on the voiced patch! Can't wait to play that version of the game!","May 31","true","15.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is very well polish with a good plot direction. It's a good read, and it's free.
