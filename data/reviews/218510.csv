The different positions in this game here are the many different planets scattered around each map in the huge  campaign mode. After playing a bit into the game you can even begin to set different types of planets, one for the bank (it produces money), some for battle planets (they function as big defensive artillery bases ... well ... sort of) and the rest for breeding more men and producing taxes.\n\nThere are three different classes to play in this game, although until now - except the robot tutorial mission at the beginning - I've only played the human species so far. But it's clear from the campaign matches and the many hints in the manual that they even have different play styles. Robots for examples don't collect taxes, they use their bodies to upgrade planets and so on ...\n\nThis game features deep tactical decisions lying under a neat and easy to lern point and click interface. Most of the time you have to act under pressure, be it time that runs against you or enemies attacking your reaches of space. There are many different mission types during the campaign (or in local / online multiplayer) only interrupted every so often for a special boss battle stages that can differ from the normal gameplay by various intriguing ideas ... but I don't want to spoil you here ... ;)\n\nSo whats left to say for me is that this is one of these mostly overseen strategy pearls you in theory just can play for a break during yourr office work. The only thing is, this game gets so amazingly addictive in a very short while, you better tell your boss it could take a while for him to see you again ... :)\n\nIn my oppinion you should totally get this game. It's fast, it's deeper in strategy than it looks and it's fun either in small bites or equally for a couple of hours at a time. Give it a try and at least download the demo. And if you tend to like the game (like I do - just in case you didn't mention yet), maybe we could get together sometime and meet up for a few online matches as this game really deserves full servers.","March 30, 2014","true","46.7"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","40","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/recommended/218510/","vmblood","VolkmasterBlood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vmblood/","222 products in account","The basis of this game is to take over planets, and then using those planets to build up more jets to take over planets with, and to eventually overwhelm your enemy with your jet ships to eliminate them.  You really only need the mouse to play.  You take over planets by clicking on them.\n\nThis seems quite cool.  However, amongst all the awesomeness that is this game, the controls feel laggy.  When I click on a planet, I don't immediately get a response from my allied planets.  And I feel in a game that requires those split decision making choices, it allows my strategy to easily fold.  I am suddenly clicking on one planet.  The exact controls are also slightly vague.  It took me a second to figure out how to upgrade, but the reasons for doing so felt almost pointless.  I could either send out ships to take over planets, or spend time upgrading them.\n\nOverall a good game.  I have better games on my game list of 200 games, but this one is still pretty good.  It just needs some touch ups from the developer.  I felt there was too much useless information on the screen as well, and the important information was placed on the same level as some of the useless stuff.  I am really on the fence with this game, but I am recommending it out of the hopes that other people will see the positives come from the negatives.","November 5, 2014","true","0.3"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

It's a fun game when you are winning but fairly frustrating when you aren't, the reason this is, is not because the game is too hard but rather the game doesn't allow for much variety in strategies. You will restart over and over untill you find the one strategy that works. This makes it an unbalanced strategy game because you may as well watch a bot vs bot match on any RTS and pretend you are one of the bots. With that said, when you are winning it's quite enjoyable and would be a VERY decent game if this feeling was well maintained. If you find it on special it is likely worth whatever experience you get but I would not pay full price.","June 5, 2015","false","3.3"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","21","25","0","0"

I really enjoyed my time with it until i got close to halfway through. At this point the game becomes stupidly difficult even on the lowest difficulty levels. I was forced to give up on the game because of this, and a quick seach of the internet indicates that I'm not alone. The developers say they lacked any outside play testing which ended up in them ramping up the difficulty because they, themselves, found the game too easy. Most indie studios do end up making rookie mistakes that lower the quality of their game. It just so happens in this case that it completely ruins the game altogether. There is no way i can recommend this game to anyone based on this.

Strategy and tactics do exist though as taking which planet and when to attack and when to defend becomes extremely critical. One move can cost you a planet and sometimes if your not quick enough to react, the game.\n\nThe premise is your a certain colony of either humans or robots, and you start conquering worlds one by one. Some battles can take place with one or up to three AI's. Of course, each sector is it's own game, so don't look to go Star Wars and try to conquer an entire galaxy. You start the game, and you are able to choose linearly which sector to attack next. Once you are at the in-game screen, the battle begins. Planets can be upgraded and can be selected to either defend or allow for attacks. Some planets when properly upgraded have some self defense mechanisms... although I wouldn't highly rely on it. Game types vary (which is always a good idea in any game) where one game may be domination where you need to take ALL planets whereas another game may have to do with monetary means to win - meaning more money you have the more powerful your units are. Send an attack wave to an enemy planet though and watch your assets freeze as your at war. Small divot game-types such as these keep the game interesting and want you to play more.\n\nThis game is good, however NOT RECOMMENDED FOR EVERYONE! If you like space games and a casual indie territory take-over game this may be for you.

Also has very simple mechanics: As you conquer planets, you increase your maximum revenue and rate of revenue increase, using revenue to move ships from planet to planet.

That’s pretty much it.\n\nI enjoyed the hour I played with a nice cartoony, yet 3D art style complimenting the simple style of game play.

Even things as simple as how many ships I actually have at my disposal to attack with isn't clearly explained either in the tutorials or in the built-in help--which is infuriating when the margins of error, apparently, are very slight even at low difficulty.\n\nI may come back to this at some point in the future, but for now I'm going back to Galcon.

You start with some planets and sending ships between your planets is free, however sending them to conquer planets costs money and you have to manage between sending enough ships and having enough money so that the ships you send dont become too weak because the ships power is based on the amount of money you have. The robot race is slightly diferent but you can only play it in multiplayer or play in the same multiplayer maps but agaisnt bots.\nYou also can change your planets between space stations, banks and normal planets with cities and each have their own utility but that is the extent of the game complexity.\nOn the singleplayer campaign your will face a few bosses and three races: the humans, the robots and a mutant insect race. There is few game modes presents in the game and the campaign early on teaches about the various modes and it has a robot race tutorial. I had fun playing however some of the late game levels are absurdly hard to the point where one of them I simply stopped trying to beat it on hard mode and even on normal thay are quite dificult. Also the capaign is 20 hours long at most.\nI have over 50 hours on record because I played some multiplayer matches with people on the foruns to get the achievements however the last achievement is kinda bs because it requires you to kill an absurd amount of enemies that is only achievable by playing over a 100 hours of this game.\nIn regards to multiplayer is lacking in game lobby listing and there isn't a proper game matching system the only way to play it is with friends. Also this game doesn't have Co-op it is just PvP.\nIn conclusion, you can find some enjoyment in this game however I only recomend picking this up on sale.","October 11, 2015","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Tons of achievements and challenges and unlockables to keep your replayability up.\n\nAll around a solid little game.","May 13, 2013","true","2.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimbob8787/recommended/218510/","jimbob8787","timesovgrace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jimbob8787/","94 products in account",""Planets Under Attack" is a strategy gem: very simple concept, yet has just enough depth to the gameplay to make it not just addicting but weirdly satisfying, especially after playing tug of war with the AI over a planet for what seems like forever and finally ripping it from their hands at the same time you attack their last planet.\n\nA quick summary of the gameplay: you start with usually one planet in one of multiple gametypes, including a deathmatch type, king of the hill type, and a gametype where you vie for control of specific planets ( the first to control all the marked planets wins, regardless of how many planets the other players have). You click on another planet and hold the mouse button to determine how many ships you want to send; neutral planets/your own planets dont cost any money to invade, but enemy planets do--at least for the human race, the only race i've played as so far, but i've read that the robots play differently--and you go from there, upgrading your planets to increase taxes and building up your defenses by transferring ships to increase the population. Again, on the surface, simple, but a game can quickly dissolve into chaos requiring quick thinking and quicker clicking to turn the tide.\n\nDefinitely recommended if you get a coupon, but for $10, its a great strategy time killer that also has a fun multiplayer. Check it out.","January 17, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I bought this for a dollar and I'm glad I didn't pay more for it. I didn't really enjoy playing it.\n\nI didn't enjoy the game play mechanic very much. As the humans (the main campaign team), you don't gain income when attacking. While I understand that it's meant to penalize constant attacking, I found it annoying. I would have preferred to have more control over my ships, rather than just directing them to a specific planet.\n\nThe difficulty level in the later missions is way too high, apparently due to lack of playtesting (apparently the devs didn't have anyone outside the company give it a try). The campaign missions put you at a huge disadvantage and trying to beat the AI is more frustrating than challenging. Maybe the multiplayer would be more fun (playing against a human instead of the AI).\n\nI'm not a big fan of the graphics. I find it looks garish and cartoony, though I do see what they were going for. I feel like this type of game is better when the art is more abstract. I experienced a lot of random slow-downs for no apparent reason when playing the campaign, which was irritating.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this game.","November 12, 2014","false","0.6"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The enemy gets an unlimited cash supply and just swarms all of your planets no matter what you do. I give tower defense games that make you play a very specific way bad reviews because that is not how you do a good TD game. This one takes the cake. If you do not play a very, very, exactly specific way and do things exactly and specifically on a timer, you will lose ships, and the enemy will gain a unlimited supply of money and neverending troops. And no matter how many ships you send to whatever planet, the game is programmed so that the very second you release the mouse button to send your ships, the computer is programmed to know exactly how many you sent and at that very exact instant sends an instant counter attack to that planet at the same time you are trying to capture it. It does not have bad gameplay it is just a bad game by design. If you like playing games where you do not have any freedom at all in how you can strategize and play, then this is for you.

In addition to the addicting gameplay, Planets under Attack is an obvious labor of love. An exciting and memorable cast of characters exist perfectly in this artistically beautiful world. From the ships to the planets, everything has an essence of its own, with a memorable soundtrack and comical sound effects breathing life into the visuals\n\nThe goal of this challenging space adventure is to conquer a galaxy of planets, while undertaking a multitude of special challenges. Take control of your mighty space armada, and wreak havoc across the cosmos, but choose your targets wisely! Conquered planets will net you income to expand your forces, but you must carefully weigh the pros and cons of attacking each planet, as timing and available resources are critical to victory. Above all else, you must keep a cool head. Enemies race to capture your territory as you hone in on theirs and multiple battles will rage on all fronts. You must make tactical decisions at every turn, from scouting your enemies and deploying units, to shoring up your planets’ defenses and knowing when to attack and when to defend. Strategic multi-tasking and a keen military mind will lead directly to unrivaled glory…while careless play will reduce your army to space dust.\n\nThe Campaign mode tests your military might with 32 thrilling levels, each with varied planets, tasks and game modes. Defend a planet until reinforcements arrive, fly into uncharted space, conquer planets and set up defenses before rivals attack - the list goes on and on, as there is no shortage of objectives in your struggle for interstellar dominance. Start out as a novice and learn the ropes, or ramp up the challenge with three levels of difficulty. The longer you play the more experience you’ll obtain, allowing you to unlock new technologies, changing the way you play and ensuring you’ll keep coming back for more!","November 25, 2013","true","445.0"," 18 of 49 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","18","49","0","1"

Your planets produce units as in Galcon but attacking requires money. While you attack you don't generate money. Also, the closer you are to your money cap, the more powerful your ships are. Also, sending ships to defend a planet you already control costs nothing. This creates a wonderful risk/reward balance where you want to commit to attacks you can win, and only with just enough ships to take it.\n\nNow add in 2 other races that each have modified rules for production (think the races in Starcraft 2 and how they are similar but unique in how they go about it) and you have not only a fine single player game but a great multiplayer setup. The campaign unfortunately only features the humans.\n\nIf you liked Eufloria, Mushroom Wars, or Blue Libra 2, there's definitely something new to like here.","September 9, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/218510/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","Planets Under Attack (PUA) is one of those fast RTS that has a very simple interface, yet has more complexities hidden under the simple rules that makes things interesting.\n\nYou've probably played many games like this before: send "units" from one "base" against an enemy base, or send units from all bases. Bases are different sizes and controls their build rate. The bigger the base, the faster they build. The idea is to conquer all the enemy bases. Galcon, Spacecom, Archipelago, they are many variations out there.\n\nPUA added several wrinkles to the game, as well as made things simpler. When you order an attack, ALL planets that's not in "defense mode" (which you can quickly toggle) will send ships to attack. However, your attack size are subject to your "budget", which controls how many ships you can send, and your budget only goes up when you are not busy sending ships. And planets can be upgraded (from level 0 to level 3) with the budget as well.\n\nThen there are "space fortresses", which shoots down hostile ships that flies near it, but not fast enough to deal with a large fleet. When it's neutral it shoots everybody. If you capture it it shoots enemies, and upgrading them increases their firing rate (but still not enough to handle a large fleet).\n\nThen there are different game modes, from simple conquer (kill all enemies) to king of the hill (hold one special system for 3 minutes against 1 or more opponents), to domination (hold special systems that generate domination points, first to 300 wins) to special conditions, like enemies that stays dormant for X minutes,\n\nThere are also alternate starting race. Instead of a human, you can play as robot with a very different starting rules.\n\nEach "mission" can be played at regular, medium, or hard which yields 0 to 2 stars. Some missions can only be unlocked with X number of stars.\n\nSome of the missions can get pretty tense. A king of the hill battle can be tense when you are trying to keep the two enemies fighting each other while you try to pick off the unprotected systems while keep both fo them equally weak and focuses on each other rather than ganging up on you, while making sure you can take away the "hill" before the timer expires to reset it. It will take a while to whittle them down and keep them weak enough for you to take the "hill".\n\nThe actual user interface is a bit weird. You can't set the exact number of ships, but instead you hold the mouse button until you got to the right number of ships, which is obviously not precise at all. Remember it's also subject to your "budget".\n\nHowever, some of the missions are impossible, or at least not explained well. There's one about repaying the "loan" but I can't seem to find the button to replay, and I don't accumulate money fast enough to repay it.\n\nStill, for people who enjoy this genre, the color graphics (slightly cartoony) and not quite serious attitude is a bit of fun.

Basic gameplay is this, you have planets which generate money. When you have enough money you click on an enemy planet to attack it and your planets send a bunch of ships over. You can't generate money while attacking so you need to stockpile a bunch to overwhelm your enemy, otherwise if they defend they will still be generating money and counter attack you while you are weakened. That's it. There's no controls to choose which of your planets to attack from, there's no moving your ships around, it's really quite dumb.

The Controller let's you send ships to attack via a menu when you press a button, where you can send 10/20/50 ships at a time. Mouse controls have you hold the LMB down until the number reaches your desired amount, but it's rather imprecise for my tatstes. And not all of the Keyboard Mouse Controls are listed in the menu, like the Tab button opening the level goals.\n\nOverall though I recommenced it.","January 28","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The video settings either can't be changed or will not take effect. Customer support has not responded to any of my emails. So the game is unplayable. I cannot recommend.","April 26","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its fun and causes lots of raging from the losers.\n\nDefinitely worth playing if you have usb controllers and have one or more people willing to play it with you. Games are prettie fast, but the more players the more worlds so might take longer then. Generally 2 players take 10mins per game at most.\n\nWorks with in-home streaming by steam really well.","June 5","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
