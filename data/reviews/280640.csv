I honestly wasn't expecting much, but here goes.\n\nThis is the WORST video game I've ever played.\n\nTHE WORST.\n\nNow, why am I complaining so much? Let me start with the technical issues. 1. I was greeted with a resolution setting that only goes up to 1680 x 1050. Not even 1080. That ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off. 2. The graphics. This looks like Half-Life 1, and for a game that is awfully new, it should looks somewhat okay, but it doesn't. This game tries to shove in your face that it has bloom and SSAO in it, but seriously, even with them, the game still looks like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. 3. Voice Acting. Dreadful. 4. Highest mouse sensitivity is still really slow for a person like me who likes to have a high mouse sensitivity.\n\nAlright, the story. Nothing special. And by that I mean pretty much non-existent. You and a bunch of "teammates" go to the castle, after it has been attacked. Turns out the girl of your dreams has been taken. Now you have to get her back. And there you go. I'm not gonna complain about the small amount of story I've been given, because honestly, I just want to try the hack and slash.\n\nThe first level. Why they made it so complicated did not make any sense to me. The first level started off with a mother‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing keyhunt. It made no sense.    It confused the living hell out of me. I needed to use a walkthrough, on the FIRST LEVEL. That's just awful. The area was big and the objects were all over the place. The controls were poor and didn't really help this game out at the slightest. Everything about this game just screamed wrong. For everyone asking about the keyhunt, imagine trying to find keys that do not even show up. That's right, you can't actually see them. Not to mention, you need a torch to even find one of them, which is just silly, because if there's a key there, then I wouldn't need a torch to actually see the key. It's a pointless quest to go find keys to open chests with other keys. But have I mentioned the fact that you literally have to walk on the walls to get an item you need? Yes, you do. You walk on the walls. YES. You literally jump on a small side railing on the wall, basically hovering to the side of it when you walk on it. I'm sorry, but I would never be able to figure that out because in a video game, I've never had to do that to actually get something. I just found that bizarre.\n\nThen the main section of the game. The fighting. Oh my.\nOH MY. OHH.\nYou get three attacks. All of which are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and don't feel natural. Combat was godawful. All you do is stab the enemy, move back, then just keep doing that until it's dead. That's it. That's the game. Oh my god. The attacks are all mapped to mouse buttons, including the middle mouse. I went immediately to change it, but WAIT, you can't change the controls. But for some reason, they have options for Bloom and SSAO instead of options for controls. Come on. Congratulations, you have shader effects. Yay.\n\nThis is the worst. Day One, Walking Dead Survival Instinct, and Postal 3, are all better than this. I didn't want to say this, but I had to. I'm here for you so you can save money. I would not wish this on my worst enemies. My point has been made. Nothing in this game works properly. Everything is bad.\n\n0/10. This is a technical nightmare. Even if this game looks fun to you (which it really shouldn't), remember that it is 10 bucks, and you can do so much more with the ten bucks. I'm genuinely upset that I spent nine dollars on this.","March 11, 2014","false","0.5"," 709 of 824 people (86%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","86","709","824","18","43"

Especially ones I've played for 44 minutes. But, thats as far as I could play this game. Its.. really, really bad. I felt like I was playing a FPS from the late 90's. Graphics are substandard, sound is reptitive and quite low quality, and the cutscenes are quite laughable. They are literally 2 characters standing there, with the camera rotating around, and occasionally focusing on.. well.. a dark field? I wasnt sure, as there was little to no detail.\n\nNow Ive bought plenty of games in early access, and if this was an Alpha, with additional graphical upgrades, sound, etc to come, then I wouldnt be too critical of it. But.. this is it. There is snow falling inside of rooms. Fog in closed off hall ways. Bricked up rooms. Stairs that are so steep that you have to hop up when you get to the top step. The punch animation looks like a piece of paper with chain mail on it.\n\nThe final straw for me was when I entered the dining room, to obtain the oil needed to light my torch. It was on top of a cabinet. A cabinet I could only climb by backtracking in the room, climbing a oveturned table, climbing half way up the wall, and then walking over to hop on top.\n\nIs this what the waitress would have done had I asked for some oil for my green salad?","March 12, 2014","false","0.7"," 165 of 192 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","165","192","3","3"

COMICALLY WRONG.\n\nOh where do I start? How about basic controls?\n\nPress spacebar to jump. Jump once and you fall twice, the second time being gravity kicking in after the preset fall animation.\n\nHold spacebar to do your impression of a rabbit on meth. Boingboingboingboingboingboing. Careful though, you can get fall damage from jumping too much. Seriously.\n\nPress M1 to bring up a mutated, paralyzed left hand, completed with an elongated pinkie finger and a stretched texture.\n\nPress M2 to bring up another mutated, paralyzed arm with a tapered, shrunken hand holding a pebble. It reels back, unmovingly, as if made of wood, then quickly forward again, throwing the pebble...which gently floats to the ground. Physics!\n\nThere is no crouch or run button (shift does nothing).\n\nThere is no map ('M' changes the mouse sensitivity) and no hints or aids in finding quest items. Now, I'm all for a little open-world exploration. Not every game needs a big old Bioshock arrow pointing at anything of interest. But this is the polar opposite. Here, there first level is a castle full of winding, identical corridors, and the first mission in that level is to find a sword and some keys. I managed to find one of the keys through blind explortion. It was difficult, though because it was the same color as everything else: greyish brown, and had nothing indicating its presence. No outline, no environmental context, not even so much as a reaction from the character when looking right at it.\n\nPress Escape to see the tiny, 200x200 pixel menu. The itty-bitty options are mostly miscellaneous graphical options, like blood decals. If TotalBiscuit ever did a WTF on DS-AoE, he might have to start playing the game BEFORE the ten minute mark, since there's not much twiddling to be done with a menu like this.\n\nAs for me, I ended my game after I jumped on even terrain and the fall damage killed me. Then the game crashed. Yup.\n\nThis is a walking simulator for insomniacs. Or, alternatively, comedy gold for people who love to laugh at terrible games. Either way, it's too bad to pass up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bayta94/recommended/280640/","Bayta94","Bayta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bayta94/","26 products in account","There isn't a whole lot more that can be said about this game that hasn't already been said. It's bad. Not even fun bad, just plain old regular BAD. But let's go over it, shall we?\n\nFirst, the graphics. Everyone knows this. Take one look at the screenshots, it's not too difficult to tell how utterly atrocious they are. The game's description on Steam says that the game has an old-school look to it, (or something like that, I can't be bothered to look up the exact quote) but old-school doesn't even begin to describe it. Castlevania is old-school. Zelda 64 is old-school. Doom is old-school. This game's graphics, on the other hand, just look like they were ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out by the leftovers from Morrowind, which in my admitedly unpopular opinion, has not aged well at all.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the controls. You can't keybind anything. You can make some adjustments to mouse sensitivity, and invert the mouse's Y axis, but that's it. Don't like the layout? Well, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you. Your character's movement, too, is just weird in general. Movement is very sluggish. Everything seems a bit zoomed in, but if you zoom out, it still just feels nauseating. Combat, if you've got the patience to even get to it (I'll get back to that), is painfully bare. There's no strategy involved whatsoever. Hit your enemy, pull back, then go back in for another hit. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThird, let's talk about the story. What's the story? A bunch of monsters and/or people in scary get-up have been ravaging the land, and got into the castle. They killed all the guards, and took all the money, taxes (yes, taxes), and swords. Also, they took this guy's sister, and you better save her, because you're in love with her. The only image we see of said woman is awkwardly animated, with flailing arms and a grand total of one facial expression. Now normally I wouldn't complain too much about the damsel in distress trope, overused though it may be, but the way this game goes about it is just stupid, to the point where I had to stop after the cutscene to finish laughing. Basic isn't even the word, bad is closer to what I'm looking for.\n\nOkay, now here's the big one. How would you expect a fantasy hack and slash video game to open? A tutorial level? Sure. What's in the tutorial level? A few low-level baddies for you to kill, with a few different weapons to try out? Nah, that'd just be asinine. Instead, let's have the tutorial level be a stupidly complex find the key quest, in an overly large castle? Yup, that sounds good to me. Yeah, no litterally, the FIRST instructions you are given in the game are to find a bunch of keys so you can get a sword. But it's not like you just find one key and get your reward. A key opens a door, which opens a chest, which gives you some unnecessary item, which lets you get another key, which THEN lets you get the sword. And all of it is separated between different rooms in this quite large castle.\n\n\nAll this makes the game seem REALLY bad. It is. But the worst thing about this game, I repeat, the WORST thing about this game is nothing I have mentioned thus far. What ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off most about this game is that Barnabas Collins didn't even get a single appearance. Or Quentin, or Angelique. 0/10 Worst Game Ever.\n\n\nNo, but really, what's with the title, guys? It's not some super obscure thing, Dark Shadows was pretty dang popular back in its day. And okay, even if you didn't know about the show, how could you completely avoid the recent shipwreck of a remake Tim Burton ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out a couple years ago? That's a lawsuit waiting to happen there.","April 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","3"

This is some strange game PROJECT that somehow found it's way to Steam and got a price tag.  I paid $1.35 USD for it, and got ripped off - if that helps explain the value of this game to you.\n\nThe starting quest is a quest that most people won't even complete because of the horrid level design and ridiculously low amount of thought put into it.  All you need to do is find keys to open a chest and some doors to eventually find a sword that you will take with you into battle against monsters.  However, just getting that far is a nightmare of boredom, and awful gameplay that will leave you feeling queezy from the graphics and motion blur in the game alone.  I had my PC set to the highest graphics option (1600x900) and still just moving through the game made me feel dizzy and sick to my stomach, and no game has EVER done that to me.  This is a first.\n\nThe gameplay also suffers from ridiculous elements that make no sense.  You start with a field of view zoomed in way to far to actually see much at all, and when you figure out the controls (J and K keys) to zoom out, you'll see your own two sadly deformed looking arms which much more closely resemble "tentacles" then they do arms.  Be careful jumping as well, as jumping on level ground might hurt you and take away about HALF of your health bar, but later when you fight a giant ugly troll monster, his bashing you in the head only takes about 1/12th of your health away.  Makes perfect sense, right?\n\nIf you can play this game and find your sword without needing to google or youtube for help, it would be amazing as it's very easy to just make endless circles cursing at how crappy the game is, feels, and looks and not seeing the damn keys or the parts needed to make a torch.  All part of the most ubsurd level and game design I have ever experienced in my gaming life.\n\nSo, once you get your sword and get to battle monsters, it "must" get better right?  HAHAHAHA!  Funny!!  Now it's just a matter of spamming your mouse buttons when near a mob while you back up to try and prevent it from hitting you.  There is absolutely no skill involved in the fighting at all, and the action looks about as good and entertaining as watching two house flies "getting it on" on your wall.\n\nQueezy motion and dull graphics.  Uninspired, never thought-out level design, mess of a game.  This is one of the worst games you will ever play.  So if you find it on sale for around $1 and just want a laugh or perhaps to make yourself sick so you don't have to go to school, then sure.. go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, you've been warned.\n\nMy Scale of 1 -10 scores:\nGraphics:  0  (blurry, motion-lagged graphics will leave you feeling queezy for sure)\nSound:  0 (your sword hitting a wooden crate sounds like jingle bells)\nGameplay: 0 (There's no fun here unless you just want a horrible game to mock and make fun of)\nValue: 0 (Even at $1, this game will make you feel cheated and robbed)\n\nOverall: One the absolute worst and stupidest games ever produced, much less sold for actual money.","August 28, 2014","false","1.2"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","30","40","5","0"

Though the graphics are old school, this was and is no problem to me. But the game is NOT responsive or very slow in response to controls, if there are any. I can hardly find any key to manipulate anything and the F1 and F2 keys are absolutely not helping much.\nWhat is even more, the entire game lacks ANY pleasure a gamer needs of this kind of game: almost NO loot, disappointing endings in which you suddenly get killed by an invisible enemy and an impossible quest at start: find a sword and some keys. After 1 hour of gameplay, I have been killed 5 times and only found 1 key, unable to defend myself and with a feeling of... disappointment.\nPLEASE TAKE THIS GAME OFF YOUR LIST.\nIt isn't even worth giving it for free..........","March 26, 2014","false","3.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

It should be against the law to charge money for something like this. The engine is so old it feels like you are running around in a 3D version of a 9yr olds microsoft paint picture. They must have spent more time finding the perfect position to take screenshot that look good than actually working on the game itself. The screenshots look good at first but once you start playing it feels like you are playing a sega genesis game.\n\nIm one of those people who can look at a terrible game and find the good in it. But this game just defies all laws of mental perception physic dynamic regulation.. If you play this game you will never be the same again.\n\nI actually gave this game a chance. A real chance. You start off and it says "I need a key and a weapon" so for literally a half hour i ran around this level looking for this key that ended up just unlocking this door that led to a torch. Than he says "I need oil for this torch" and i looked for soo long around the entire map and i ended up seeing this 25ft tall wooden hutch. And at the top i saw what looked like a bottle of wine (oil) and i was like.. wtf there is no crates or anything to jump up there. Turns out you have to just run straight forward at the wooden flat wall of the hutch and your character just magically slides right up the face of the hutch. okay..\n\nThe rest of the game is just a linear path of multiple enemies and when you fight them your character just clips right inside their body. So the entire fight is just you inside some orc's body clicking for 1 minute and a half until he dies. There is no way you can tell if you sword thrusts are making contact with the enemy so you just have to do around 100-150 clicks until he dies. There is no strategy, no blocking, no shielding, just standing in front of eachother just hitting eachother with swords. There is no physically possible way to kill an enemy without losing 70% of your health because you can not dodge or defend. This makes progression impossible because the game just places another enemy every 10ft of the linear path.\n\nI quit when i came across a rock that says "you can not go this way you have to hammer it down" so i press forward and i just run right through it.\n\nThere is no common sense in this game either. They will just make a door locked and you have to find a key which is just 15ft behind a bunch of bushes in some dirt that is LITERALLY impossible to see. You just have to spend a ton of time moving around each pixel of the entire map until the game says "you found a key". And even if you do see a key or something on a table, you have to move back and fourth over it for a good 45 seconds before the game actually picks it up for you.\n\nIf you can play this game for one hour you have super human abilities.\n\nCan't find the key? not a problem just run forward through the door. Yes.\n\nThis game should be free on a flash player games website. I paid mere pennies for this game in a bundle of 6 other games and i still feel ripped off.\n\nDelete this game off the planet somebody before somebody gets hurt","March 31, 2014","false","1.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

But it surpassed all my expectations. The game is a crime against humanity. Even making such things should be punishable by law. One just can't possibly comprehend it's grandeur - this thing is a mental torture. I think we are stretching the definition of a game with this one. It's a great luck if the thing won't launch on you, but I worked hard to get into it and now I wish I wasn't. I must admit - the game is unintentionally creepy.

But they don't state clearly why.\nNow when I actually started to understand. You can't pick a single bad quality of a game, because EVERYTHING is awful. Controls, visuals, performance, audio, gameplay, story, cinematics, loading times, menus, every damn thing in this game is broken BY DESIGN. There isn't any significant bugs because it's all broken by design and it's unfixable by any level of polish.\nJudging by performance/visuals and require to disable Data Execution Prevention alone it might even summon Satan in your basement, so clear your browser history while you can.\n\nYou just couldn't imagine it until you see it. And then you couldn't explain what you saw and felt and you just go post gibberish on steam reviews when repulsion buils up enough for venting.\nYou'll feel dirty after 10 minutes with this one.

It involves walking around a confusing castle-type area to find a key, so you can acquire yourself your very own sword. Now, what confuses me about this is the fact I found a guy, very obviously dead on the ground, holding a perfectly acceptable sword and I couldnt help but wonder, "why can't I just take this guys sword?!?" Instead I had to wander around an ugly looking castle area for a key to open a chest to give me access to a weapon I could find ON THE FLOOR!!\n\nSecondly, the graphics. I know graphics isn't generally something you should judge a game on as it's the gameplay and content that matters, but bloody hell, this is one ugly game. I tried to look past it, but it just looks so bad, and it really doesn't help sell the game whatsoever.\n\nThirdly, it's boring. It got boring QUICKLY. I can normally get past the intitial boredom of some games, I just press on and the game starts to pick up and I start to enjoy it, but this. This! After 10-15 minutes I was done! Sick of the terrible voice acting, sick of the dreadful graphics, and sick of trying to find a stupid key, for a weapon I wasn't allowed to just pick up. I would of rather spent those minutes watching paint dry, it might of been a little more productive than this train-wreck.\n\nI don't know if I can not recommend a game enough, but I'm going to try. DO NOT TOUCH THIS! You will waste both your money and whatever little time you'll probably put into this.

The first level is an abomination in fetch quests, with one part, fetching oil for your torch, not even remotely making sense. I don't understand how the developer thought it made sense that you have to walk along a ledge on a wall, with your character basically floating above the ground, to get to the top of a cabinet that holds the oil you are looking for.\nAfter you finish the first level, you watch yet another poorly rendered movie, and then on to the second level, which is just about as bad. The problem these levels really have is that they are almost like mazes. You are required to endure a very slow trek through levels with no sense of direction to them. It would make sense if the levels followed some form of logic, or had a graphical quality to them that helped point you in the right direction, but you will find no such thing here.\n\nThe combat is hard to read, as you aren't sure just how much damage your strikes are doing, or if they're hitting at all. Meanwhile, you are moving backwards after every strike to not be hit, while lunging forward to do a hit. It requires little skill at all, and isn't fun.\n\nI hate to harp on a game that from what I have heard, has very few developers, to the potential of only 1 developer. I find it hard to believe one man did all the programming, music design, graphical design, and whatever else went into making this game, but if that is the case, it is impressive it reached a finished product. It just seems pointless, however, to make such a flawed product. I can only hope the game gets better with time, but I feel that simply isn't possible without a complete overhaul to this game, from the engine, to the controls, to the levels and graphics themselves.\n\nI'm sorry, but I simply cannot recommend this game. I was lucky to receive it as part of a bundle, with the luck falling on the part of paying a low sum for multiple games, and not having this game as part of the bundle received.","May 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I didn't have particularly high expectations going into this game, but after playing it, I can say with certainty that this is my GOTY.\n\nThe characters and rich background really add to the atmosphere of the game. When I heard that not only the gold, taxes AND WEAPONS were being held by the monsters (Spoilers: They are only in disguise), I shed a tear. And then to discover that Katarina, with whom I am in love, is also in danger... I spent 5 minutes sobbing uncontrollably before getting into the game proper. The fact that the entire kingdom had fallen to a group of monsters who aren't really monsters while I was off chasing a runaway horse (which the intro character brilliantly mispronounces) only adds another layer of depth to the gripping narrative, which truly ponders the nature of the human condition.\n\nNow for the gameplay. The main character's snail-like movement speed (even while sprinting) adds a level of tension one could find in inferior games such as The Last of Us or Dead Space, but then takes it to the next level.

I honestly wasn't expecting much, but here goes.\n\nThis is the WORST video game I've ever played.\n\nTHE WORST.\n\nNow, why am I complaining so much? Let me start with the technical issues. 1. I was greeted with a resolution setting that only goes up to 1680 x 1050. Not even 1080. That ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off. 2. The graphics. This looks like Half-Life 1, and for a game that is awfully new, it should looks somewhat okay, but it doesn't. This game tries to shove in your face that it has bloom and SSAO in it, but seriously, even with them, the game still looks like ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. 3. Voice Acting. Dreadful. 4. Highest mouse sensitivity is still really slow for a person like me who likes to have a high mouse sensitivity.\n\nAlright, the story. Nothing special. And by that I mean pretty much non-existent. You and a bunch of "teammates" go to the castle, after it has been attacked. Turns out the girl of your dreams has been taken. Now you have to get her back. And there you go. I'm not gonna complain about the small amount of story I've been given, because honestly, I just want to try the hack and slash.\n\nThe first level. Why they made it so complicated did not make any sense to me. The first level started off with a mother‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing keyhunt. It made no sense.    It confused the living hell out of me. I needed to use a walkthrough, on the FIRST LEVEL. That's just awful. The area was big and the objects were all over the place. The controls were poor and didn't really help this game out at the slightest. Everything about this game just screamed wrong. For everyone asking about the keyhunt, imagine trying to find keys that do not even show up. That's right, you can't actually see them. Not to mention, you need a torch to even find one of them, which is just silly, because if there's a key there, then I wouldn't need a torch to actually see the key. It's a pointless quest to go find keys to open chests with other keys. But have I mentioned the fact that you literally have to walk on the walls to get an item you need? Yes, you do. You walk on the walls. YES. You literally jump on a small side railing on the wall, basically hovering to the side of it when you walk on it. I'm sorry, but I would never be able to figure that out because in a video game, I've never had to do that to actually get something. I just found that bizarre.\n\nThen the main section of the game. The fighting. Oh my.\nOH MY. OHH.\nYou get three attacks. All of which are ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and don't feel natural. Combat was godawful. All you do is stab the enemy, move back, then just keep doing that until it's dead. That's it. That's the game. Oh my god. The attacks are all mapped to mouse buttons, including the middle mouse. I went immediately to change it, but WAIT, you can't change the controls. But for some reason, they have options for Bloom and SSAO instead of options for controls. Come on. Congratulations, you have shader effects. Yay.\n\nThis is the worst. Day One, Walking Dead Survival Instinct, and Postal 3, are all better than this. I didn't want to say this, but I had to. I'm here for you so you can save money. I would not wish this on my worst enemies. My point has been made. Nothing in this game works properly. Everything is bad.\n\n0/10. This is a technical nightmare. Even if this game looks fun to you (which it really shouldn't), remember that it is 10 bucks, and you can do so much more with the ten bucks. I'm genuinely upset that I spent nine dollars on this.","March 11, 2014","false","0.5"," 709 of 824 people (86%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","86","709","824","18","43"

Especially ones I've played for 44 minutes. But, thats as far as I could play this game. Its.. really, really bad. I felt like I was playing a FPS from the late 90's. Graphics are substandard, sound is reptitive and quite low quality, and the cutscenes are quite laughable. They are literally 2 characters standing there, with the camera rotating around, and occasionally focusing on.. well.. a dark field? I wasnt sure, as there was little to no detail.\n\nNow Ive bought plenty of games in early access, and if this was an Alpha, with additional graphical upgrades, sound, etc to come, then I wouldnt be too critical of it. But.. this is it. There is snow falling inside of rooms. Fog in closed off hall ways. Bricked up rooms. Stairs that are so steep that you have to hop up when you get to the top step. The punch animation looks like a piece of paper with chain mail on it.\n\nThe final straw for me was when I entered the dining room, to obtain the oil needed to light my torch. It was on top of a cabinet. A cabinet I could only climb by backtracking in the room, climbing a oveturned table, climbing half way up the wall, and then walking over to hop on top.\n\nIs this what the waitress would have done had I asked for some oil for my green salad?","March 12, 2014","false","0.7"," 165 of 192 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","165","192","3","3"

I managed to find one of the keys through blind explortion. It was difficult, though because it was the same color as everything else: greyish brown, and had nothing indicating its presence. No outline, no environmental context, not even so much as a reaction from the character when looking right at it.\n\nPress Escape to see the tiny, 200x200 pixel menu. The itty-bitty options are mostly miscellaneous graphical options, like blood decals. If TotalBiscuit ever did a WTF on DS-AoE, he might have to start playing the game BEFORE the ten minute mark, since there's not much twiddling to be done with a menu like this.\n\nAs for me, I ended my game after I jumped on even terrain and the fall damage killed me. Then the game crashed. Yup.\n\nThis is a walking simulator for insomniacs. Or, alternatively, comedy gold for people who love to laugh at terrible games. Either way, it's too bad to pass up. I recommend it.","September 1, 2014","true","0.6"," 96 of 145 people (66%) found this review helpful 82 people found this review funny","66","96","145","82","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bayta94/recommended/280640/","Bayta94","Bayta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bayta94/","26 products in account","There isn't a whole lot more that can be said about this game that hasn't already been said. It's bad. Not even fun bad, just plain old regular BAD. But let's go over it, shall we?\n\nFirst, the graphics. Everyone knows this. Take one look at the screenshots, it's not too difficult to tell how utterly atrocious they are. The game's description on Steam says that the game has an old-school look to it, (or something like that, I can't be bothered to look up the exact quote) but old-school doesn't even begin to describe it. Castlevania is old-school. Zelda 64 is old-school. Doom is old-school. This game's graphics, on the other hand, just look like they were ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out by the leftovers from Morrowind, which in my admitedly unpopular opinion, has not aged well at all.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the controls. You can't keybind anything. You can make some adjustments to mouse sensitivity, and invert the mouse's Y axis, but that's it. Don't like the layout? Well, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you. Your character's movement, too, is just weird in general. Movement is very sluggish. Everything seems a bit zoomed in, but if you zoom out, it still just feels nauseating. Combat, if you've got the patience to even get to it (I'll get back to that), is painfully bare. There's no strategy involved whatsoever. Hit your enemy, pull back, then go back in for another hit. Rinse and repeat.\n\nThird, let's talk about the story. What's the story? A bunch of monsters and/or people in scary get-up have been ravaging the land, and got into the castle. They killed all the guards, and took all the money, taxes (yes, taxes), and swords. Also, they took this guy's sister, and you better save her, because you're in love with her. The only image we see of said woman is awkwardly animated, with flailing arms and a grand total of one facial expression. Now normally I wouldn't complain too much about the damsel in distress trope, overused though it may be, but the way this game goes about it is just stupid, to the point where I had to stop after the cutscene to finish laughing. Basic isn't even the word, bad is closer to what I'm looking for.\n\nOkay, now here's the big one. How would you expect a fantasy hack and slash video game to open? A tutorial level? Sure. What's in the tutorial level? A few low-level baddies for you to kill, with a few different weapons to try out? Nah, that'd just be asinine. Instead, let's have the tutorial level be a stupidly complex find the key quest, in an overly large castle? Yup, that sounds good to me. Yeah, no litterally, the FIRST instructions you are given in the game are to find a bunch of keys so you can get a sword. But it's not like you just find one key and get your reward. A key opens a door, which opens a chest, which gives you some unnecessary item, which lets you get another key, which THEN lets you get the sword. And all of it is separated between different rooms in this quite large castle.\n\n\nAll this makes the game seem REALLY bad. It is. But the worst thing about this game, I repeat, the WORST thing about this game is nothing I have mentioned thus far. What ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me off most about this game is that Barnabas Collins didn't even get a single appearance. Or Quentin, or Angelique. 0/10 Worst Game Ever.\n\n\nNo, but really, what's with the title, guys? It's not some super obscure thing, Dark Shadows was pretty dang popular back in its day. And okay, even if you didn't know about the show, how could you completely avoid the recent shipwreck of a remake Tim Burton ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• out a couple years ago? That's a lawsuit waiting to happen there.","April 30, 2014","false","0.5"," 27 of 32 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","27","32","0","3"

This is some strange game PROJECT that somehow found it's way to Steam and got a price tag.  I paid $1.35 USD for it, and got ripped off - if that helps explain the value of this game to you.\n\nThe starting quest is a quest that most people won't even complete because of the horrid level design and ridiculously low amount of thought put into it.  All you need to do is find keys to open a chest and some doors to eventually find a sword that you will take with you into battle against monsters.  However, just getting that far is a nightmare of boredom, and awful gameplay that will leave you feeling queezy from the graphics and motion blur in the game alone.  I had my PC set to the highest graphics option (1600x900) and still just moving through the game made me feel dizzy and sick to my stomach, and no game has EVER done that to me.  This is a first.\n\nThe gameplay also suffers from ridiculous elements that make no sense.  You start with a field of view zoomed in way to far to actually see much at all, and when you figure out the controls (J and K keys) to zoom out, you'll see your own two sadly deformed looking arms which much more closely resemble "tentacles" then they do arms.  Be careful jumping as well, as jumping on level ground might hurt you and take away about HALF of your health bar, but later when you fight a giant ugly troll monster, his bashing you in the head only takes about 1/12th of your health away.  Makes perfect sense, right?\n\nIf you can play this game and find your sword without needing to google or youtube for help, it would be amazing as it's very easy to just make endless circles cursing at how crappy the game is, feels, and looks and not seeing the damn keys or the parts needed to make a torch.  All part of the most ubsurd level and game design I have ever experienced in my gaming life.\n\nSo, once you get your sword and get to battle monsters, it "must" get better right?  HAHAHAHA!  Funny!!  Now it's just a matter of spamming your mouse buttons when near a mob while you back up to try and prevent it from hitting you.  There is absolutely no skill involved in the fighting at all, and the action looks about as good and entertaining as watching two house flies "getting it on" on your wall.\n\nQueezy motion and dull graphics.  Uninspired, never thought-out level design, mess of a game.  This is one of the worst games you will ever play.  So if you find it on sale for around $1 and just want a laugh or perhaps to make yourself sick so you don't have to go to school, then sure.. go ahead and buy it.  Otherwise, you've been warned.\n\nMy Scale of 1 -10 scores:\nGraphics:  0  (blurry, motion-lagged graphics will leave you feeling queezy for sure)\nSound:  0 (your sword hitting a wooden crate sounds like jingle bells)\nGameplay: 0 (There's no fun here unless you just want a horrible game to mock and make fun of)\nValue: 0 (Even at $1, this game will make you feel cheated and robbed)\n\nOverall: One the absolute worst and stupidest games ever produced, much less sold for actual money.","August 28, 2014","false","1.2"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","30","40","5","0"

In a VERY bad way. The swing animation of your weapon takes much more time than your enemies's, and it's really hard to hit your enemy in such way. If the game wasn't hard enough already, there are scarred in every bugged area some bugged food, that are intended to restore your bugged health that you lost in a bugged way while you were fighting bugged orcs and skeletons trying to enjoy this bugged game at a bugged price.\n\nAnd, dulcis in fundo, the controls, the controls...

It should be against the law to charge money for something like this. The engine is so old it feels like you are running around in a 3D version of a 9yr olds microsoft paint picture. They must have spent more time finding the perfect position to take screenshot that look good than actually working on the game itself. The screenshots look good at first but once you start playing it feels like you are playing a sega genesis game.\n\nIm one of those people who can look at a terrible game and find the good in it. But this game just defies all laws of mental perception physic dynamic regulation.. If you play this game you will never be the same again.\n\nI actually gave this game a chance. A real chance. You start off and it says "I need a key and a weapon" so for literally a half hour i ran around this level looking for this key that ended up just unlocking this door that led to a torch. Than he says "I need oil for this torch" and i looked for soo long around the entire map and i ended up seeing this 25ft tall wooden hutch. And at the top i saw what looked like a bottle of wine (oil) and i was like.. wtf there is no crates or anything to jump up there. Turns out you have to just run straight forward at the wooden flat wall of the hutch and your character just magically slides right up the face of the hutch. okay..\n\nThe rest of the game is just a linear path of multiple enemies and when you fight them your character just clips right inside their body. So the entire fight is just you inside some orc's body clicking for 1 minute and a half until he dies. There is no way you can tell if you sword thrusts are making contact with the enemy so you just have to do around 100-150 clicks until he dies. There is no strategy, no blocking, no shielding, just standing in front of eachother just hitting eachother with swords. There is no physically possible way to kill an enemy without losing 70% of your health because you can not dodge or defend. This makes progression impossible because the game just places another enemy every 10ft of the linear path.\n\nI quit when i came across a rock that says "you can not go this way you have to hammer it down" so i press forward and i just run right through it.\n\nThere is no common sense in this game either. They will just make a door locked and you have to find a key which is just 15ft behind a bunch of bushes in some dirt that is LITERALLY impossible to see. You just have to spend a ton of time moving around each pixel of the entire map until the game says "you found a key". And even if you do see a key or something on a table, you have to move back and fourth over it for a good 45 seconds before the game actually picks it up for you.\n\nIf you can play this game for one hour you have super human abilities.\n\nCan't find the key? not a problem just run forward through the door. Yes.\n\nThis game should be free on a flash player games website. I paid mere pennies for this game in a bundle of 6 other games and i still feel ripped off.\n\nDelete this game off the planet somebody before somebody gets hurt","March 31, 2014","false","1.3"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It involves walking around a confusing castle-type area to find a key, so you can acquire yourself your very own sword.

I know graphics isn't generally something you should judge a game on as it's the gameplay and content that matters, but bloody hell, this is one ugly game. I tried to look past it, but it just looks so bad, and it really doesn't help sell the game whatsoever.\n\nThirdly, it's boring. It got boring QUICKLY.

The first level is an abomination in fetch quests, with one part, fetching oil for your torch, not even remotely making sense. I don't understand how the developer thought it made sense that you have to walk along a ledge on a wall, with your character basically floating above the ground, to get to the top of a cabinet that holds the oil you are looking for.\nAfter you finish the first level, you watch yet another poorly rendered movie, and then on to the second level, which is just about as bad. The problem these levels really have is that they are almost like mazes. You are required to endure a very slow trek through levels with no sense of direction to them. It would make sense if the levels followed some form of logic, or had a graphical quality to them that helped point you in the right direction, but you will find no such thing here.\n\nThe combat is hard to read, as you aren't sure just how much damage your strikes are doing, or if they're hitting at all. Meanwhile, you are moving backwards after every strike to not be hit, while lunging forward to do a hit. It requires little skill at all, and isn't fun.\n\nI hate to harp on a game that from what I have heard, has very few developers, to the potential of only 1 developer. I find it hard to believe one man did all the programming, music design, graphical design, and whatever else went into making this game, but if that is the case, it is impressive it reached a finished product. It just seems pointless, however, to make such a flawed product. I can only hope the game gets better with time, but I feel that simply isn't possible without a complete overhaul to this game, from the engine, to the controls, to the levels and graphics themselves.\n\nI'm sorry, but I simply cannot recommend this game. I was lucky to receive it as part of a bundle, with the luck falling on the part of paying a low sum for multiple games, and not having this game as part of the bundle received.","May 5, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I didn't have particularly high expectations going into this game, but after playing it, I can say with certainty that this is my GOTY.\n\nThe characters and rich background really add to the atmosphere of the game. When I heard that not only the gold, taxes AND WEAPONS were being held by the monsters (Spoilers: They are only in disguise), I shed a tear. And then to discover that Katarina, with whom I am in love, is also in danger... I spent 5 minutes sobbing uncontrollably before getting into the game proper. The fact that the entire kingdom had fallen to a group of monsters who aren't really monsters while I was off chasing a runaway horse (which the intro character brilliantly mispronounces) only adds another layer of depth to the gripping narrative, which truly ponders the nature of the human condition.\n\nNow for the gameplay. The main character's snail-like movement speed (even while sprinting) adds a level of tension one could find in inferior games such as The Last of Us or Dead Space, but then takes it to the next level. By making the player character's hands see-through and seemingly boneless, we are given a glimpse into the soul, the very essence of mankind. A true work of artistic brilliance.\n\nI experienced my first death after jumping on the stairs and then glitching out for several seconds. Upon my death, maniacal laughter could be heard.
