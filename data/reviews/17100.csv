Some of the more modern things are, aside from the obvious graphics being different, that you no longer need to worry about intersections sending your supply and maintenance people entirely the wrong direction. You can now actually focus on building a city, rather than having to puzzle out the most efficient way to place buildings without them collapsing, catching fire, and starving because the food vendor doesn't show up there.\n\nCitizens in your city are in a class society. From top to bottom, they are the pharaoh. That is you, and your family. You have a palace, and your family goes out to collect any sort of material, be it luxury goods or a humble pot to store things in. You are the state. All food belonging to the city also belongs to you, but you will always have a nice supply of food stored away in your palace. Pharaoh gets first pick, and a percentage of all food farmed in taxes.\nJust below you are the nobles, who live in large houses and get their income from the farmers under them, and in order to support a large farming population, you will need nobles to guide them.\nUnder the nobles are the educated elite. Priests, scribes, overseers, and commanders of the military. They have similar demands as nobles in terms of luxuries, but they are paid by the government for their services. Only the sons of nobles and luxury shopkeepers qualify for education. These are the doctors, the administration, and the tax collectors. Because nobles will try to dodge paying taxes, a scribe can catalogue how many fields have been sown so that you know exactly how much belongs to Pharaoh.\n\nUnder them still, the middle class. Entertainers and shopkeepers. These earn their bread through their services and the goods they sell. Simple, but neccesary for society to function.\nBelow them, the peasantry. Farmers and servants. The farmers work the land and earn enough food to last until next harvest in doing so, and the servants do the shopping for nobles and collect resources for luxury shopkeepers - So they don't have to mingle with the common folk.\nSeparate from them all are government workers. They fit somewhere between the middle class and peasantry, and are paid generously by Pharaoh's bread. They are the brickmakers, the construction workers for bigger buildings(Small buildings like a servant's shack are made by the servants themselves), and anything else government wants from a papyrus maker up to the military.\n\nIf at any time your system fails and the people are without food, they will leave their jobs to scavenge for it. Dates, pomegranades, fish and so on are plentiful, so you need not fear you'll ruin your city and have a ghost town.\n\nThe game starts slow every map, as you have 10 bricks(Enough for one baker, brickmakers huts don't need bricks), and only one educated person in your city at the start. So you will want to build a school and several brickmakers more to ensure you can keep growing. Before you know it, you've spend several hours building. There is no immigration either, from what I can find. You start the map with 200-300 citizens living in huts, scavenging off the land. After that, children will be your main population growth. This becomes an issue when you want a big military, as military men don't get married - They live in their barracks-tent with two other men.\n\nSome things that are bad, there are a lot of shrines out there that will take a bit to figure out which goes where and which are popular - If you even have room for them. Sometimes your citizens or a merchant may get stuck on a corner, and sometimes you may find your labourers can't figure out which limestone block they want to pull, and manage to fail to move any of them.\n\nIn the end, it's still a pretty and somewhat relaxing game where you can spend hours getting your city just right, and then decide to change it up again because you have a new idea. Cosmetic things like gardens, plazas and trees are free to place too, so you can make it look good without having to worry about your workers spending ages watering the plants and not farming.\n\nWorth grabbing it if you like citybuilding, it's good at what it does","November 17, 2014","true","60.9"," 95 of 97 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","95","97","2","6"

I pride myself in digging up golden PC titles that receive little fanfare, and this game is surely one of those. As an ancient Egyptian simulation, this game is a unique city-simulation concept with excellent execution and historical accuracy. The mechanics are distinct, with the three "Seasons" revolving entirely upon the flooding of the Nile. The only currency is the only one that truly mattered in the ancient world; food.\n\nLike Ancient Egypt, religion plays a key role in the game, with a rich and diverse pantheon of true-to-life Egyptian Gods and Goddesses to be honoured by Temples and Shrines. Every person in your settlement is represented in the game and has unique needs, most notably religious needs. Soldiers, shop-keepers, peasants and elites all demand an opportunity to pray to the Gods and Goddesses which best represent their needs, while everyone will want to worship Amun, Osiris and Hathor; the Universal deities whose festivals were paramount to most Egyptian cultures.\n\nOf course, you will be building an awful lot of pyramids, obelisks and steles to immortalize yourself, mighty Pharaoh, and cement the legacy of your lineage. Throw in a flavourful soundtrack and a diverse array of scenarios and missions and you have the best $2 I have ever spent on steam. I must buy for any city-building lover, Egyptophile or classic game collector.","December 2, 2013","true","24.7"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","77","82","2","0"

The game itself is pretty laid back and peaceful feeling, and the music is quite nice, too.  My one complaint would be that sometimes, when you select a person roaming around town, they say something utterly anachronistic and stupid, and I find that detracts from the overall mood of the game.

There are some glitches in the game I have had a few problems but nothing serious just annoying.  There have been a couple of additions such as the brickyard which are helpful and some new decorations since I first played it.\n\nIf you enjoy city building you might want to try this one.  You can also do some retexturing of buildings, plazas, costumes.  I enjoy doing that and perking up the city a little bit.

Graphically, CotN is quite solid - it looks pretty, plenty of resolution choices for an older title. Gameplay-wise, roads, plazas and all decorative items are free, so you can grid and beautify your city from the get-go. Even on the small maps, you have plenty of room to build. Unlike the other city builders, there is no strict road attachment requirement either, and the open-world pathfinding works well.\n\nWhere CotN suffers terribly, however, is on challenge factor and pace.\n\nThe gameplay is slow. Excruciatingly slow. During play, virtually nothing happens that you need to cope with reactively. While there is trade with other cities, each and every site has all the basic resources to thrive alone. Once you know the build order, there's no need to deviate from it, ever. City guards and walls are utterly useless for the cost in bricks and manpower - luckily, you don't need them on any map, ever.\n\nI've just finished the campaigns, and each and every map boiled down to this; build the basic city of peasant shacks, noble homes and shops, copy-pasted from previous map. Wait for a harvest. Block out into brickworks and basic infrastructure. Wait two harvests. Expand. Wait more harvests. Begin farming the 'special' resource you need to win that map (army, navy, monuments, imports, etc). Wait a huge amount of harvests. Win the map.\n\nI wish I was joking, but my playthrough boiled down to each hour being five minutes of city-building, fifty-five minutes of waiting. I read through several books while I "played" this game at maximum speed; there was no need to pay attention at all, not even the 'disasters' that hit are worth any adjustment - mostly because by the time they happen, or the interface tells you people are unhappy, it's already too late to do anything about it save let it ride itself out, be it disease, hunger or discontent.\n\nCompared to Pharaoh, where each map was distinctly different and had different challenges based on which resources you had available, what you could import/export and what monuments you could build, Children of the Nile repeats the same tedious thing on every map, and at the same time offers no challenge whatsoever save waiting, and waiting some more. Slow pace is all well and good, especially in a city builder - but Children of the Nile is positively glacial compared to all the other city builders Impressions/Tilted Mill ever produced, and that absolutely kills it as a game.\n\nI enjoyed the books I read while the game run. I did not enjoy 'playing' this game. Again, it's not bad or broken - it's just incredibly tedious. For that, I cannot recommend it - save if you want an easy 100% achievements game. All you need is a ton of patience and a few good books. I'd still recommend Pharaoh / Zeus / Casesar III/IV over this one any day, as a game to play and enjoy.","January 17","false","59.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

There were three main reasons why I like this game, 1) the setting is rarely covered, most city builders are focused more on modern architecture. 2) The attention to detail and novel feature of Children of the Nile, and that's it has a very unique economic system -- a food based economic system. Talk about realism, you don't get close to re-living the Egyptian society than paying your government workers food. Children of the Nile also has a strong class system, also representing ancient Egypts strong class society, relying on every member to be in his/her place from peasant, middle class, and noble. How you gain and manage each of these classes is unique, but the game ensures that the player knows that in order to manage more peasants/farmers, you need plenty of nobles. Lastly, 3) the quality of 2006 game is very impressive. Plenty of resolution support and a lot of graphics and audio options, including some for the interface and gameplay. I haven't experienced any crashes or bugs either. The content advertised through the trailer, screenshot, and Steam product store is as advertised, and the voice acting and audio description before a mission is top notch. The graphics and attention to certain Egyptian architectural structures is very pleasing. The music only adds to the immersion and there's plenty of resources and freedom to build your city uniquely to your liking. Decorations are free so you can start planning the layout of your city without much hassle or delay. There's even in-game info, help menu that will explain what the building does and who works it if you are new. There's plenty of missions and content for the price, therefore, it very well worth base price. The developers know it's a great deal too because the game didn't get a price cut during the holiday sale. Even if you played SimCity[4], Tropico, Grand Ages Rome, Anno 2070, Dawn of Discovery, Stronghold, Zeus, Caesar or any other city builder, you'll still get a kick out of this game. It's amazing, it feels original and is very entertaining. Children of the Nile will be perfect for you especially if you are looking for a city builder set in an archaic setting of a former time. Take a look at other reviews as well, lots of other players already have phenominal amounts of hours racked.\n\nThat sums up my review, if a developer reads this, I hope you guys will be able to bring the Caesar games to Steam, and be able to finish Medieval Mayor with enough support if the series sells well on Steam. Best of luck, your games are amazing, thank you for creating such memorable gems. You guys will always hold the place of the best city builders in the genre.\n\nThanks for reading, if you think you might like this game pick it up -- support these developers, it's way better than the sorry rip-off excuse early access/DLC scams nowadays..","January 6","true","6.3"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

Pretty much, you can build 100 pyramids if the map can hold it.\n\nCons: Sometimes the game can crash unexpectedly, not many missions in general campaign, not much historical/mythological context is given with missions as in the predecessors (found them to be enlightening and neat).","September 28, 2014","true","40.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

It lags occasionally when a city gets really big, aside from lagging at every autosave. The AI can be infuriating at times: If you like micromanaging, be prepared to sit back and pull your hair at your laborers who will go across the Nile and over 2 mountains to haul limestone, while an overseer stands by himself overseeing no one in a site right next to their houses. Transporting heavy loads, like statues and obelisks across the Nile is also a well known problem, annoyingly time consuming at best, unsolvable at worse (unless you're willing to delve into the editor). It shows its age in a lot of ways, the graphics included, though they still hold their own fine enough.\n\nAnd now that you have all that information, just look at the time I've sunk in this game. It's just a great city builder. Flawed but great. The setting is interesting, the concepts are the same old, yet refreshingly different. It doesn't have an insane depth of strategy (it may even feel a bit simplified compared to other similar games), yet it feels satisfying. Most of the strategy involved is focused in where you build and what you prioritize, which needs to ignore and which to focus on, so really, when to build what where. There is enough you need to balance for it to stay challenging, between food cultivating, prestige maintaining, religious needs and building pyramids. There's also some nice extra bits of historical info hidden away in the interface if you want to learn something new.\n\nThe game is easy enough to pick up if you play the tutorials, which are ok: basically playable, hand-holding, mini versions of the game - I felt I was playing, not reading a tutorial. Even so, looking up some of the details on how the AI works will help you understand the mechanics better. There are huge forums with tons of info, player maps and walkthroughs available online which can help with that. Also worthy of mention, I found the interface easy to use and perfectly adequate, which I think is very very important in a city builder.\n\nShould you buy? Yes. Provided you understand that this is a game released in 2008 that has its share of small annoyances, if you like leisurely paced city builders this is still a solid game that hits many marks.","March 30, 2014","true","70.9"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Challenging scenarios in campaign mode ranging from "easy" to "hard" so you can first practice and then go to tougher terrain after the first playthrough. Do not get confused by these ratings, though, because even the easy campaigns can get pretty messy and challenging at times, not taking any prisoners. The game has quite a good and quick learning curve. In fact, the first scenario should teach ou basically everything you need about the basics. If you get the basics right especially in the beginning of scenarios, the game is more about strategy than micromanagement. If you get it wrong, you will be lost in fixing all that you messed up; better to start over in that case if I'm honest.\nThe game provides hours and hours of gameplay, building, growing and exploring/connecting to the world outside your immediately designated scenario area. You can open trade routes, cooperate with friendly cities, fend off enemies and remotely lay siege to your enemies while supplying all your expeditions with resources you manage to get together (or not). Though not really for complete beginners, I can recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a good challenge in building strategy games.","May 15, 2014","true","98.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Egypt is a facinating place to build a city, full of wealth, religion, and monuments only a mad man would attempt to build.\n\nYou are a dynasty of pharohs who's job is to build a city and thrive. Start with a pack of farmers and shop keeper, then bring in nobles, educate their children, who then become priests, merchants, and commanders in your armies. The game requires a balance between the wealthy classes who provide you with more farmers and unique resources and the poor who feed everyone else and make the basic goods. Not only that but on some maps raiders and traders appear who will either provide exotic goods or take everything you got. It's a beautifully complex game that makes for a challange.\n\nThat being said I do have complaints. You can rarely have cities going for 70+ years withour the people becoming massively unhappy and harder to please. This is because not only the fact that as time goes on you are expected to provide even larger temples and exotics to the people the base resources you do have dindle with little respawn. Not only that but it appears they try further to discourage long games by increasing bad events, like long droughts and floods, and provide less good harvests to make it stressful to even feed the people. While campaigns, having set goals, this problem does not concern you, in sandbox mode it is annoying to have to give up a game because no matter how hard you try the people will get angry. Also the game limits how big you can get, limiting the vital educated elite to only 30 or so men, severely limiting you're abilities to expand across the map. This game is designed for 50-70 year games with populatons that will never exceed 1000 people (still a crap ton in this game).\n\nWhile it may seem like I have more complaints than I have compliments don't be scared of this game. For what little time it wants you to play it is more than enough time to get massive temples and pyrimids up and trade from all corners of Egypt to flock to your markets. It is a simple strategy game that will provide at least 30 to 40 hours of content and even more if you customize your own maps and play on them.\n\nTL;DR Buy the game if you like city builders and Egyptians.","April 30, 2015","true","61.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
