A low recommend, if you will. In The House of Caravan, you spend the game exploring a house, you have limited lighting, and must make use of matches to light things in the environment, and a flashlight with limited battery life (I only managed to find a couple of batteries during the game). You mostly go around, looking and collecting items for puzzles, and keys to unlock doors. It's a first-person adventure game where you freely walk around, and has some slight horror tones, though nothing particularly scary happens (there's two light jump scares and some strange audio cues at points, and the house starts shaking at random intervals, but nothing particularly spooky happens from it).\n\nThe house is nicely designed, and is fun enough to explore. Some of the puzzles are a bit of fun, none are too hard and most are easily solved. There's some physics when you pick things up. Some of the music is nice. The story isn't bad, but there isn't anything remarkable about it either. Game is on kind of the short side, probably taking someone 90-120 minutes to complete it. There are optional documents laying around you can pick up which have voiced dialogue talking more about the background of the game.\n\nIf you can get it for a cheap price and don't mind a sort of light adventure game, it's worth playing. There are much better game's than it in the same sort of genre, but for a cheaper price it's not a bad bet. There are a few niggles with it, I witnessed some frame drops, and a few glitches of me dropping something on the floor and it flinging me into the air a bit, but nothing too bad and some light polish could easily fix this. Some audio volume elements were also a little low in my opinion.\n\nIf you want to explore a house with some light puzzles in it, then it's decent. If not your cup of tea, you won't be missing anything amazing by skipping out on it.","April 16, 2015","true","1.9"," 44 of 49 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","44","49","0","0"

The house looks good and the atmosphere of the game is great.

The question becomes, will you escape, or are you trapped forever?\n\nThis first person exploration game has a few puzzles and lot of things to explore. You start in a house and must explore the house to figure out why you are there and the mystery surrounding your circumstances. Honestly there are few bugs in the game that I noticed. Occasionally my character would 'jump' if I did something weird like opened a drawer and looked up in some weird fashion, but overall, the game was a very smooth experience that I didn't expect at all. Seeing as the game has been bundled, I was not expecting such a nice experience.\n\nSound: The background music is rather appropriate and ominous which makes sense as you're trying to figure things out and you're not quite sure how bad things will get. The individual sound assets seemed very fitting and I never questioned them. Your character will respond to certain prompts with one phrase over and over again, which gets mildly irritating as there is no variation, but it's completely ignorable. One thing I really enjoyed was the voice acting for certain things. I could take a break during certain segments and listen to it while I took care of some small task at my desk.\n\nGraphics: A lot of time was put into making a full experience here. While the graphics may not be the best in the world, I can definitely say that they tried their best to make a complete experience. For the price tag, I have zero issues with them. Kudos to the dev.\n\nStory: The story is rather well put together. You discover bits of it as you explore and it's rather well done. A few bits could be a little more fluid, but really no complaints at all. It was rather enjoyable to find out what had happened and why between solving mysteries and puzzles.\n\nControls: Zero complaints. Though I would have liked a bit faster running speed, it's really nothing to stress about. Everything pretty much makes sense and works. The rotation speed of objects is a little slow, but I don't really know why you'd care, unless you want to inspect everything up close and see it from every angle. Personally wasn't a factor for me.\n\nOverall: 6.9/10 - Honestly the game is very good for what it is. Even though the game has been bundled in the past, I don't see any reason not to spend $5 on it. I think the developers did a great job on this game and deserve support. It's a cohesive gaming experience that immerses you into the world of the protagonist and challenges you with some fun puzzles in between your explorations. A very nice experience.","May 29","true","3.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"

I LOVE "explore the old house while figuring out what happened there" games.  And this one does quite a bit right.  The actual story content is short and lacks detail, but remains solid and interesting.  The graphics and atmosphere, in still images, are brilliant.  However...\n\nI don't know what game engine was used to make this, but it's an awful fit.  The physics in play is frequently inappropriate and distracting.  Your character clips onto random surfaces like open drawers and any miscellaneous stuff strewn about.  As a result, the camera seems so shakey that you might feel some slight motion sickness by the end.  Occasionally, completely ridiculous things happen, like getting caught up in a tapestry and being launched up to hit your head against the ceiling.\n\nThe game includes flashlights that run out of batteries and a finite supply of matches.  Neither is really in short supply, which means this is just a pointless annoyance.  You're just reluctant to use these things, which distracts you from the good part of the game: intense exploration.\n\nPuzzles are well designed, but poorly implimented.  For about half, your character refuses to begin until you've found a handful of nearby objects.  That would be fine, except your character is unwilling to tell you what he imagines you still need beyond phrases like "I need something."\n\nAs a plus, I find the game's estimate of "60-90 minutes on a first playthrough" to be weirdly modest.  If you don't have a walkthrough propped up in front of you the whole time, I'd really expect it to be double that, at least.\n\nIt really was fun.  And it's hardly expensive.  Just expect it to feel a little rough around the edges in a handful of ways.","September 27, 2015","true","2.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

I LOVE "explore the old house while figuring out what happened there" games.  And this one does quite a bit right.  The actual story content is short and lacks detail, but remains solid and interesting.  The graphics and atmosphere, in still images, are brilliant.  However...\n\nI don't know what game engine was used to make this, but it's an awful fit.  The physics in play is frequently inappropriate and distracting.  Your character clips onto random surfaces like open drawers and any miscellaneous stuff strewn about.  As a result, the camera seems so shakey that you might feel some slight motion sickness by the end.  Occasionally, completely ridiculous things happen, like getting caught up in a tapestry and being launched up to hit your head against the ceiling.\n\nThe game includes flashlights that run out of batteries and a finite supply of matches.  Neither is really in short supply, which means this is just a pointless annoyance.  You're just reluctant to use these things, which distracts you from the good part of the game: intense exploration.\n\nPuzzles are well designed, but poorly implimented.  For about half, your character refuses to begin until you've found a handful of nearby objects.  That would be fine, except your character is unwilling to tell you what he imagines you still need beyond phrases like "I need something."\n\nAs a plus, I find the game's estimate of "60-90 minutes on a first playthrough" to be weirdly modest.  If you don't have a walkthrough propped up in front of you the whole time, I'd really expect it to be double that, at least.\n\nIt really was fun.  And it's hardly expensive.  Just expect it to feel a little rough around the edges in a handful of ways.","September 27, 2015","true","2.6"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

Good.  Than like me you gravitate to these exploration and story based games.

The story is told through letters you find along the way.  There are also keys to find and puzzles to solve.\n\nThe sound is quiet good as it has that Vincent Price/ Edgar Allen Poe movie quality to it.\n\nIf you are into the old school turn of the century horror you will also notice the many books and music around the house that gives nod to that form of terror.\n\nI found it a joy to read the titles of the books while lighting every room hoping nothing went boo around the next corner.\n\nBut like I said, I gravitate to these exploration and atmospheric story based games where the horror does not come from the monster that you can see (no monster at all) but the horror of what people are willing to do to protect what they find most important and the tragedy of human choice.

Give it a try if you get it in a bundle, or you’re somehow given a free copy. Should this be corrected, I’ll gladly revise this review in favor of the developer.","January 14","false","1.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game also serves (as I understand it) as a prelude to unfortunately failed kickstarter project "Death in Candlewood" and offers a bit of flavor for the world they had built for that game. Whether or not that project ever sees completion, House of Caravan provides an interesting enough short mystery story to keep you interested as you move through the house trying to find a way out.","May 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Good.  Than like me you gravitate to these exploration and story based games.  And this story based game is all about the old school horror of Poe and similar writers.\n\nTaking much influence from the Fall of the House of Usher you find yourself as a young man in a decaying mansion that creaks and moans as you try to find a way out.  The story is told through letters you find along the way.  There are also keys to find and puzzles to solve.\n\nThe sound is quiet good as it has that Vincent Price/ Edgar Allen Poe movie quality to it.\n\nIf you are into the old school turn of the century horror you will also notice the many books and music around the house that gives nod to that form of terror.\n\nI found it a joy to read the titles of the books while lighting every room hoping nothing went boo around the next corner.\n\nBut like I said, I gravitate to these exploration and atmospheric story based games where the horror does not come from the monster that you can see (no monster at all) but the horror of what people are willing to do to protect what they find most important and the tragedy of human choice. That basic fear of the unknown that has us flinching at the merest trick of light and shadow and our own imagination.","October 28, 2015","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But nevertheless, i think it's a good game, even though the description text of the game is a bit exagerated :p\n\nTook me two hours to finish. Nothing really hard or challenging, nothing that will blow your mind, but still, it's well crafted  and i often felt uncomfortable walking around those dark rooms and looking at every corner with aprehension, and the story was both interesting and shady.\n\nSo i'd say this game is worth its price ! Good job Rosebud, and i hope you'll be able to finish Death in candlewood now !","December 11, 2015","true","2.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
