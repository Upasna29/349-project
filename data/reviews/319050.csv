Taken at face value, it's a duel between wizards capable of summoning dangerous creatures and unleashing mighty spells of destruction. Now that description could apply to any number of games but there are three elements that make this one special.\n\nIf Sid Meier once described games as a series of interesting decisions, Chaos Reborn's gameplay could be described as a series of calculated gambles because the random number generator plays a pivotal role in casting and combat. Experienced players frequently describe the game's strategy in terms of risk-management: minimising risk to yourself while forcing your opponent into taking risky actions. Yeah, you could definitely seize the initiative by summoning a majestic Sapphire Dragon on your first turn but a lowly Dwarf would be a safer bet.\n\nThere will naturally be moments when your gambles don't pay off and even 90% spells fail. Here's the second element that makes Chaos Reborn engaging: tactical improvisation. You don't win duels with the spells in your deck; you win duels with the spells you actually cast. The biggest mistake new players make is anticipating only successful outcomes for risky actions. You'll frequently see wizards rushing towards their opponents aggressively, waving their staves dramatically in the air and then completely embarrassing themselves with a failed cast. This is hugely entertaining when it happens to your opponents; not so much when it happens to you. Hope for success; plan for failure.\n\nHowever, there will also be moments when you absolutely need a creature regardless of the risk involved. Perhaps you need a Hellhound to petrify an advancing Giant. Perhaps you need a Giant Spider to ensnare a rampant Vampire. Here then is the third element that makes Chaos Reborn special: bluffing. Bluffing in this game is accomplished with illusions and they are often the key to victory. Instead of taking the risk of summoning a real creature, players may opt to cast an illusory version of it. Casting an illusion is guaranteed to succeed and illusory creatures function exactly as their real counterparts would but illusions are not without their own risks. If a sceptical opponent chooses to disbelieve an illusion, it immediately disappears so if your entire game plan revolves around one key falsehood, the consequences of being caught out can be far-reaching and disastrous.\n\nUsing illusions effectively is the most difficult skill in the game to master but the payoff  is huge. The best Chaos Reborn players can leave their opponents frustrated, flummoxed and uttering other f-words by fooling them into disbelieving real creatures and convincing them illusions are real.\n\nIn other games, you merely defeat your opponents.\n\nIn Chaos Reborn, you leave your opponents questioning reality.\n\nRecommended for: players who love Blood Bowl matches and X-COM battles.\n\nNot recommended for: players who are convinced 90% means guaranteed and 10% means impossible.\n","November 26, 2015","true","421.0"," 242 of 249 people (97%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","97","242","249","21","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lluluien/recommended/319050/","lluluien","Lluluien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lluluien/","106 products in account","I'm going to not recommend this game, but I'm going to do that with the caveat that if you read the positive reviews and think you will like it, you should probably give it a shot anyway.  The game is very pretty, it feels very fluid (no bugs or UI lag that I experienced), and it's definitely a different take on the squad tactics genre.  I have no problems with this game that aren't purely down to personal taste, but I feel like I'm an archetypical player of games of this type, so I feel like I should provide a "caveat emptor" for anyone like me that sanity-checks a game purchase with the negative comments before buying.\n\nThe "different take" part above was the part that I didn't like.  This game resolves every single action on an all-or-nothing basis.  Every monster essentially has 1 hit point; the only thing the stats dictate is the hit % chance.  Your spells are the same way; almost all the worthwhile ones have a base of 50-70% chance of success, and if you fail, you lose the spell from your hand, you lose your cast for that turn, and nothing happens except gaining a few points of mana that you can use up to get 3-5% higher chance to cast your next spell.\n\nAll this resounding success/abject failure stuff happening over and over makes this game INSANELY high-variance.  You can be rolling the opponent, and then he'll make a desperation summon of a couple 30% creatures and succeed, then proceed to dismantle your entire board state with them.  Of course, this happens the other way around too, but do you care, if you're losing that bad?  Wouldn't you like to win because you played well, and then a win like that feels dirty?  On the other hand, if you are playing well, doesn't it feel 10x more dirty when you lose because of something like this?\n\nI'll repeat myself above that I don't think this is necessarily a bad design.  It definitely helps with any kind of matchmaking disparity if the underdog can pull out a spectacular win every now and then on a guy that should otherwise beat him 99% of the time.  I bet it also makes more of the games into memorable stories too, something they claim a couple of places on the Steam store page.  I'd probably welcome this in a casual card game that I might play with my 10 year old since it's fun for him to have a chance to gutterstomp me on draws or dice rolls, but I don't think that's the audience they're going for here, is it?\n\nI think in some ways this is supposed to be mitigated by the illusion/disbelief mechanic, and maybe that works in games with people (which I didn't get around to because the tutorial took long enough for me that I was already past the point of eligibility for automatic refund), but it definitely didn't with the AI.  The reason it didn't I suspect might end up being valid in games with people too - the poke/counter-poke establishment of battle lines that everyone is familiar with in these games takes long enough that both wizards easily run out of spells in their decks in the games that I played.  When this happens, the only thing left for you to do with that phase of your turn is simply disbelieve all of your opponent's units.  That really cheapened this part of the game for me, because if you successfully get an illusion out that the opponent doesn't disbelieve immediately, then you can't play defensively with it, because eventually it'll fail the smell-check at the end of the match, and then your unit blows up and you don't have a spell in hand to replace it with.\n\nI hate to be down on this one, but it is what it is!","October 26, 2015","false","3.0"," 489 of 618 people (79%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","79","489","618","13","52"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/recommended/319050/","stubar","stubar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stubar/","1648 products in account","Chaos Reborn is a rework of a game created in 1985, so thirty years ago!!  The original game was written on the ZX Spectrum and called "Chaos: The Battle of Wizards".  It was developed by Julian Gollop who was also the creator of the original x-com which most people are familiar with.  I used to play the original "Chaos" game way back then in the eighties, so when I heard the news that the same developer was going to be working on the remake I was extremely excited!!\n\nIt plays like a conventional table-top game with dice rolls.  The game is played between two, three or four wizards that have a random number of spells at their disposal which are distributed at the start of the game, similar to a card deck.  The spells consist of creature summons, buffs, environment spells and magic-attacks.\n\nThe map is hex-based so looks a little similar to other turn-based strategy games but we have many differences in Chaos Reborn.  For starters there is no hit-point system.  A successful attack on one of your army means it will die.  The calculation takes into account the attack vs defence so you can still use your summons with high defence to block and tank but there is a chance that it could be defeated with a lucky shot.\n\nEvery action in the game has a percentage chance of success.  These chances can be influenced via a number of factors including mana, elevation, buffs, law/chaos alignment.  Spells are either aligned with Law, Chaos or are Neutral.  The more Law spells cast successfully, the more the world changes to become Law attuned and future Law spells will be given a buff to the spell casting chance, the same is true for Chaos aligned spells.  This means that a 20% success spell can, in the right circumstance get buffed all the way up to 100% casting chance!  So influencing these factors and casting at the right times can be a crucial part of your winning strategy.\n\nAnother important mechanic is the ability to cast 100% successfully when summoning a creature by means of opting for an illusion.  The illusion will function exactly the same as a real creature with the exception that your opponent can call your bluff.  They may cast a “Disbelieve” spell and if successful the creature will vanish and your opponent will get another casting turn.  If the creature is real then your opponent won’t get another chance to cast a spell until their following turn.\n\nYour turn consists of moving and casting a spell, but you are completely free to move any creature in any order during your turn and you can also choose to cast at any point.  This opens up the tactics and makes it a lot less restrictive than most TBS games that have turn and movement phases.  Considering line-of sights and moving, positioning and casting in the most efficient order can be the difference between victory and defeat!\n\nGames can be played live with a timer with options of between one and three minutes per turn.  Alternatively you can play up to twenty asynchronous games which can be played over a number of days or even weeks, taking your turn at your leisure.  If you find yourself enjoying the game you can enter into one of the many community leagues or tournaments organised outside of the main game.\n\nDuring the early-access I posted regular screenshots to my steam feed and the most popular comments was how nice the game looked.  It really is eye candy and there are so many nice touches such as the backgrounds and lighting subtly changing colours depending on whether the world is law or chaos aligned.\n\nThe development team “Snapshot” continue to develop this game past its full release and we are expecting new features to be added such as new spells, in-game social features and more.\n\nThere really is no other game similar to Chaos Reborn with its eclectic mixture of gaming elements.  I’ve tried to describe the core game as best as I can to give you the clearest picture of what this game is.  If it even remotely sounds like your type of thing then I can highly recommend this purchase.","October 28, 2015","true","612.5"," 135 of 152 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","135","152","5","8"

I found it was the perfect game for taking a break from work. I would start a game, cast some spells, kill some creatures and basically have fun. Whether I won or lost I would go back to work feeling refreshed. The best thing for me was that every game was different, since you had to adapt your strategy to the spells you got, rather than designing a strategy and then picking the spells to implement it. So, after playing Chaos for 30 years, you'll understand that I was a tad excited when I heard that Julian Gollop was planning to work on a Chaos reboot, so to speak, to be called Chaos Reborn.\n\nI've been a backer since day one and I've been having great fun watching the game grow, playing the early prototypes and exchanging ideas with other people (including Julian Gollop himself) in the Chaos Reborn forum. Instead of saying "Here's a new version of the prototype, see you next time", Julian says "Here's a new version. What do you think? Does this work? What about this? How can we make the game better?". I truly feel that Julian values everyone's input, and the improvements made in each version of the prototype reflect just that. Some things are added, others are removed, and the game gets better and better with every new version.\n\nWhat is the game about, then? Well, each player controls a wizard and your goal is to be the last wizard standing. Each turn you can move your wizard, attack other creatures and - most importantly - cast spells. Spells include creatures, magical attacks, magical equipment (like swords and shields) and other fantastic stuff like Shadow Trees and Gooey Blob. In every turn there are decisions to make. Shall you risk having your wizard in the front on keep him or her in the rear, while letting your creatures fend for themselves? Shall you use your mana to boost the casting chance of spells or shall you save it in order to try getting your mega spell? Shall you take the initiative or hold back in the corner and trust that the other wizards will be kind enough to kill each other while you watch and wait for the perfect moment to strike?\n\nAnother great thing is that you whenever you cast a creature you have the option of making it real or an illusion. Real creatures are subject to casting chances, with stronger creatures like dragons and hydras being quite difficult to cast. Conversely, illusions work every time, but they can be destroyed instantly with the disbelieve spell. This adds a bluffing element to the game. Each time you see an enemy creature you wonder if it's real or an illusion, but the only way to find out is either by killing it or by casting disbelieve, and if it turns out that the creature is real then you will have wasted your chance to cast a spell for that turn and may find yourself wishing you hadn't. Only a Chaos and/or Chaos Reborn player knows the feeling of giving everything you've got in order to kill a creature, only to see it blow up in smoke and to realise that it was an illusion all along and that you could have simply disbelieved it.\n\nBy the way, since the first Chaos Reborn prototype came out I haven't playing the original Chaos again. As things stand, I have played Chaos for 30 years and I truly believe that I will be playing Chaos Reborn for the next 30. Kudos to Julian Gollop and his team for making an early access game so immensely fun to play.","December 9, 2014","true","003.4"," 107 of 114 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","107","114","0","2"

Audio    7    Pleasant background music throughout the game, there is a slightly oriental / mystical feel to the music which fits very well with the game. Sound effects are good.       Gameplay    8    Chaos Reborn is (at the time of this review) Early Access and as such some features / modes are not yet available, but I was able to try the single player (where you play against up to 3 AI opponents) and multiplayer battles. The learning curve upon starting the game doesn't seem as steep as I expected and players used to this genre of game will most likely feel right at home. You are prompted to start with offline single player battles to learn the game and I would recommend this. For your first battle you are given popups which prompt and help you learn different aspects of the game.\n\nAt the start of each battle your character is given randomly a set of spells (some of which you have access to and others which are held in reserve) and a staff which favours a certain type of spell and contains a special powerful mega-spell which requires a number of mana gems to use. The players/AI then take turns to move their characters/summoned creatures around the battle arena, attack and cast a spell. You can also throw away spells which earn you mana gems and another random spell card from your remaining stack (be careful you can run out!).\n\nEach spell has a chance to work, these chances depend on how powerful the spell is and also on the balance of Chaos / Law spells that have already been cast. More Law spells being cast successfully make it easier for other wizards to cast Law spells, I found this very powerful and a really interesting feature. You can also increase the chances of a spell working with mana gems, but you need to be careful which spells to apply gems to and which ones to just gamble with. There is a good range of spells and the balance of power seems good overall, but the random nature of the spell draw coupled with the possible failure of spells can force your strategy.\n\nSummoned creatures have a set of stats (how good they are at attacking / defending / etc) and a large range of abilities to explore. You also have the ability to summon an illusionary version of your creature which removes the failure chance but leaves it susceptible to a spell called Disbelieve which will cause your creature to disappear (this can give a great advantage if you are able to bluff your opponents).\n\nTo win you need to kill the other players or have the most killpoints (earned by killing opponents summoned creatures) when the turn timer runs out. The AI is good but of course the real challenge is battling against other players in multiplayer mode. The old adage "easy to learn and difficult to master" feels very appropriate for this game, but even when losing its a lot of fun to play.        Replayability    8    Chaos reborn has great replayability, the random nature of the spell draw, Law/Chaos Balance, placement within the battle arena and other conditions means you have a huge range of possible scenarios that you will need to deal with. There is no one winning strategy its a combination of dynamic strategy - adapting to and making the best to your current position, knowledge of your spells/creature abilities, skill and a bit of luck.         Overall    8    Chaos Reborn as it stands is a great game, fun in single player mode, challenging in mulitplayer and with some fantastic features being introduced that i'm really looking forward to (like the coop RPG mode).  *** This review was made with a review key ***\n\nMore reviews by Fancy Fish\nAgree / Disagree?

It's defining characteristics are:\n- Tactical positioning. Move your creatures around on a hex-based grid keeping in mind your opponent's capabilities.\n- Risk management. The game is random. Very random. The key to overcoming this randomness is seeing past this and maximizing your win chance by taking into account all possible outcomes. Should you attack your opponent in melee for a 71% chance to win the game on the spot, or will opening yourself up to counterattack actually decrease your overall win chances?\n- Epic balance shifts. One cast or one attack can totally shift the balance of battle. Succeeding on a 30% cast for a giant Hydra will give your opponent headaches, but not as much as him killing the Hydra with a puny rat (3% kill chance).\n- Mindgames. You always have to question your enemy. Was he really lucky on that cast, or is he bluffing you with illusions to circumvent the fail chance?\n\nThe state of the current game is solid, with over 40 different spells of which 15-30 are randomly added to your 'deck' every game. Every game is different, from 2 minute stomps to 30 minute back-and-forths with numerous monsters fighting it out.\n\nThe community is VERY FRIENDLY. There is a lot of banter during games, which the game itself inspires because every game is a short and epic story. Matchmaking is rudimentary but functioning and there is a dedicated tournament website + chat room to support the social aspect.\n\nThe only current drawback I see is the size of the player base. At the peak times it's very easy to find a match, but during European work hours it can be impossible because there's next to nobody online. Another reason for you to buy the game and come join us.\n\nBuy this game if you want a laid-back, slow paced game that is both clowny and deeply tactical at the same time.","June 13, 2015","true","23.4"," 43 of 48 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","43","48","0","1"

Every action has only a certain probability of success and, therefore, you need to manage the risks vs the rewards at every step.\nTo master the game, you always need to find out what your best move is. Do you try to summon an eagle with success rate 80 % or do you summon an illusion, which always works but might get disbelieved by your opponent? Do you use your precious mana points to boost the probability of some spell or do you save it for the mega spell? Do you move forward and try to kill your opponent with a magic bolt, leaving you open to a possible counter attacks when you miss?\n\nMatches can be played in live mode (2 mins per turn, 3 mins in unranked) or in asynchronous mode (2 days per turn).

Robust multiplayer options, plus a solid single player experience give this game enormous longevity. This is from the same designer as the original X-Com game, and he knows how to design compelling games that you'll be playing years from now. Highly recommended.\n\n\n--Original Early Access review:\n\nI always wanted to see Chaos: Battle of the Wizards (the original game that this is based off) remade because I feel it's a timeless design with wide appeal. It's the only game that I ever managed to get three generations of my family around the TV playing together. It's a game that's easy to learn and play, and even gives new players a chance at victory, but it also rewards experience and skill. There's a lot of tactical depth to this game once you learn the strengths and weaknesses of the different spells and creatures. It takes a few games before you really start to appreciate this.\n\nChaos Reborn is one of the few remakes that actually retains the feel of the original game, yet brings it up to date and improves the rough edges of its inspiration. It's extremely addictive, and even after playing essentially the same game for 30 years (we're talking thousands if not tens of thousands of games, I've played it a lot!) I still enjoy the hell out of it. I even encounter new situations, new ways of approaching the game. I seriously expect to be playing this for years.\n\nI won't go over the mechanics here because others have explained it well in their reviews, and the game does a good job of introducing you to its systems (there's a good set of tutorials that gradually introduce the mechanics, plus there are harder challenge scenarios that teach tactics), although understanding the depth of its tactical options takes a lot of experience. The community around this game is excellent so far, lots of friendly players willing to help newcomers, and after hundreds of games I think I've only ever met one total nutter.\n\nThe finished game has been polished to a shine, with robust multiplayer options and a solid single player experience.\nThis Early Access version is extremely polished, it really feels like a finished game, although right now there's only multiplayer skirmish mode available. That's enough to keep you going for months (years in fact, going by past experience!) but there's more to come. Right now we're only playing with a small subset of the planned spells, so the depth will increase considerably over time. There are also plenty of balancing tweaks still happening, although after 7 months it's playing very well. Coming soon is single player hotseat including AI wizards, and later a whole single player RPG-based campaign, and special abilities for social ranks once achieved. I'll update my review once they're available.\n\nOverall this is my most played game so far in 2014, including the prototype, and I never tire of it. If you're on the fence because it's Early Access, I'd say this is the most polished Early Access game I've seen, although there's the odd bug here and there still. The only reason to hold off now is if you're after single player; it's coming, but right now it's multiplayer skirmish only.","December 10, 2014","true","266.9"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","40","45","0","7"

In Chaos Reborn, you'll be knee deep in that very concept rather quickly.\n\nIn this game, you play as a master wizard who is capable of casting various spells, though the majority of them deal with summoning of creatures of all sorts. It plays out as a turn-based strategy that involves tactics and risk management for the most part.\n\nYou begin each match with your wizard and your opponent on a sprawling arena filled with various elevations and features. Each turn you can do each of three things: Move, attack, and/or cast a spell. Movement and attack is pretty straight-forward, and this, as well as the other interactions, are done on a hex grid for the arena. Casting a spell is where your options really come in. You start the game with a hand full of cards, each with a prominent percentage to show the likelyhood of that spell being cast, the alignment of the spell, be it law, neutral, or chaos, and the actual name and picture of the spell. Hovering over each of these allows you to see more details such as attack power, defense power, etc. You can click on the info botton to get the full overview of the spell itself as well.\n\nWhen casting spells, particularly with the creature summoning types, you have the option of either casting it for real with the probability depicted, or an illusory variant which is 100% gauranteed to cast successfully. This is where the game has an interesting bluff mechanic. These illusory creatures will act exactly like their real counterparts, only they can be disproven should your opponent feel you are posturing. This is done by a spell that all wizards have and will always have access to as it has infinite uses. This spell, called Disbelief, can be cast on a suspected target to attempt to rule out if it's real or not. If the target is real, then the one spell a wizard can use that turn is used up and the creature's real origin is confirmed. However, if the target was an illusion, the creatures dispells and is removed from the arena and you can cast another spell, be it the Disbelief again, or some other spell.\n\nWhen creatures are summomed, they are controlled in a similar fashion as your wizard; moving and attacking. However, they cannot cast spells as that is strictly reserved to your wizard. Creatures come in all varieties and types from slow melee to agile ranged types. There are even undead and strange magical creatures with great power. The arena itself has an alignment shift that occurs as law and chaos spells are used. (Neutral ones don't affect this.) Each type pushes the alignment bar in that respective direction. So each law spell will shift the balance of the arena more towards law. This shift provides a bonus to probability of casting that type of spell which goes up the further shifted the bar is. It does not however provide a bonus to neutral spells nor does it penalize the polar opposite type of spells. In this way, players can try to manipulate their chances further.\n\nThe arena itself also tends to have elevations which provide bonuses and penalties to attack. For example, a creature attacking from a higher elevation would have a bonus to attack something below. The opposite would be true if the creature below were trying to attacking something up high, in which case, a penality to attack. Everything in this game has only one hit point, even your wizard. In fact, in traditional rules, killing the opponent wizard is all that is needed to achieve victory. As such, much like in chess, treat your wizard as if it were a king and protect him at all costs. Inversely, whenever there is an opportunity to try to attack the enemy wizard, take it!\n\nThe cards you get come from a deck that you draw from any time a card is expended. The cards in the deck are sort of random in that the deck you play with does not always yield the same cards. Rather, your deck is assembled before each encounter automatically from a pool of cards that are determined based on the gear your wizard has equipped. Talisman items that you find later can be set into your staff and armor will can allow gauranteed cards to show. These talismans can also grant passive effects and even ones that require mana to activate. Mana is gained over the course of a battle from killing opponents, sacrificing your own spell cards, or finding mana deposits on the map itself. This mana not only allows activation of abilities, but can be used to activate your mega spell, or even increase the probability to cast a spell at the rate of 1 mana per 1%, which has a cap determined by your equipment.\n\nThe graphics are well done and quite thematic for a fantasy filled with magic and wonder. The sounds are appropriate and good quality. The music is good, but could use some extension with more tracks and variety. The interface is very intuitive and well organized. Actions you do for moves and attacks and have to be confirmed with another click to execute, which reduces error of doing something you don't wish to. The camera can he panned, zoomed, and even rotated to get a good view of what's going on.\n\nThere are various ways to play the game, single player campaign, offline skirmishes, online arena and realm based play, and quick matches. The campaigns and realm offer an interesting approach to the game which allows for story, hiring mercenaries, rumors and quests, territory control, and some exploration. Online play can present itself as either player versus player or even inviting allies to join you for teams or cooperative assault against the AI.\n\nI have had a lot of fun so far playing this game, even though there will be moments of frustration when 100% is the only way to ever guarantee something will cast. ;) Still, it's this tiptoeing with chance that makes it fun, especially when that 20% chance fires off just at the right time when things get down to the wire. The big reason I am writing this review is it surprisingly seems like this game hasn't gotten as much attention as it deserves, though that's just based on the fact barely anyone on my friends list has it or even has it on their wish list.\n\nIf you're not sure how you feel about a game like this, be sure to check out the demo! Thanks for reading. Until next time.","December 24, 2015","true","34.8"," 36 of 43 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","36","43","2","1"

Slay dragons! Summon the hydra! This is Chaos Reborn.\nSummary: Fast-Paced Wizard Chess With RNGYou start in an arena with one to three other wizards. You have one of several staffs and a plethora of spells. You can summon hordes of creatures and send them into battle while you support them with your magic. Or cast sword of law, hop aboard a manticore, and challenge the enemy wizards in personal combat. You can bluff by summoning creatures as illusions. Entrap hostile monsters with the gooey blob. Singe your opponent's eyebrows with a magic bolt. There is a great deal of strategy involved, but luck also plays a big role in the game, making every match unique.\n\nThe Luck FactorEvery spell you cast has a percent chance to succeed. Every attack you make has a percent chance to kill. There are no hit points in Chaos Reborn. An action is either wildly successful or a dismal failure. This makes for exciting swings in fortune! One moment you might be sitting on top of the world because you've cornered your opponent with a sapphire dragon, unicorn, and giant spider. Suddenly, your opponent's magic bolt kills your spider, your opponent runs the unicorn through with her sword, and your opponent's rat somehow manages to slay your dragon (an 8% chance!). Now you're on the back foot and have to do some fast thinking to salvage the situation.\n\nThe luck factor can create some ridiculously funny situations in Chaos Reborn. My most fun and memorable games have involved wild swings in fortune. That being said, careful planning is still a very important aspect of the game. You must be constantly aware of your chances, maximize your odds, and prepare a backup plan in case lady luck doesn't go your way. Bluffing can also help control the influence of luck. (See below.)\n\nBluffing!Although all spells have a percent chance to fail, you can choose to cast any creature as an illusion and automatically be successful 100% of the time. An illusion behaves precisely like a "real" creature: it can attack, defend, fly, and carry you around on its back if it is a mount. But perhaps an enemy wizard suspects that huge dragon you summoned last turn is an illusion. He casts Disbelieve on your dragon and it vanishes in a puff of smoke. That's the downside to using illusions. If the dragon had been real, the Disbelieve spell would have failed and your opponent would have wasted his turn! If you are a great bluffer, you can probably get away with summoning lots of illusory creatures. If you are a very perceptive person you can probably deduce which creatures your opponents have summoned as illusions and Disbelieve them!\n\nGraphicsI am a big fan of the graphics in this game. The art direction is distinctive and avoids the typical visual cliches associated with well-known fantasy creatures like unicorns and dwarves. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Law tend to have cool colors and a rigid crystalline appearance. Spells and creatures identifying with the concept of Chaos tend to have warm colors and an "entropic" aesthetic. If you like unique art direction, you will love this. If you prefer predictable visuals that you can easily associate with character models from other games, this will probably not be your cup of tea.\n\nMore to Come!There is a great deal more to be added in the coming months. There will be a social rank system with orders (guilds), demi-gods, and gods. Have you ever wanted to be a God? Well start gathering your worshipers because you will have that chance in Chaos Reborn!\n\nWhat the Game Is NotSome folks seem to be under the impression that this is a deck-building game similar to Magic: the Gathering. It really isn't. Chaos Reborn does not have thousands of spells to choose from, and you will probably never have full control over the "deck" of spells that you bring into duels.\n\nWould you like to know more?

After that be warned there is definitely a phase where you know everything but nothing at the same time, you will have many rude awakenings while you learn to master all of the chaos. Once you make that effort and jump over those initial hurdles you will be rewarded with one of the finest tactics experiences to come out in quite some time.\n\nYou have your standard Chaos modes where everyone has roughly equivalent random loadouts each match (both sp and mp modes for this). There is enough depth in standard Chaos alone to warrant this game being remade in the first place, definitely solid stuff here.\n\nThe real heart of this remake however (imo) is in the Equipped modes.  In these Modes wizards can choose between 1 of 3 body armors and 1 of 12 staff types. Body armors primarily effect your wizards stats and staves primarly effect what type of spells are your deck each battle and your ability to cast them. To top it off you get 6 Talisman slots (out of 92 total talismans) to further customize your loadout with things like adding specific spells to your deck, creature auras, wizard abilities, tricks, etc.\n\nWhat this does is bring in a deck building mechanic, making this game play like chess + poker + mtg (or hearthstone). I went with a "Zoo" archetype for my first competitive build, but expect to find all of your facorite ccg archetypes plus whatever odd ball styles you can canjur out of the chaos. Equipped mode is by far my  favorite way to play the game. You can earn equipment and talismans through both singleplayer and multiplayer game play. Single player has a significant edge here and is well worth doing!\n\nThe singleplayer content for this mode is fantastic, a list of dev/user created realms which you can explore a la a mini King's Bounty map, when you are questing inside of a realm you can choose to either offer support as an ally for a fellow wizard or choose to invade someone realms. You can also request an ally yourselves on the tougher battles! This adds a wonderful mix of social co-op and invasians (optional) to your singleplayer TBS tactics experience, a very fresh addition!\n\nThe Multiplayer is also fantastic, you have your standard real time modes, quick matches and private matches. You also have 40 asynchronous slots, meaning you can 40 passive games going where you take your turns when able (2 day time limit). The mix of real time and asynchrounous smoothly meshed together is fantastic. I can come home from work and play for just a little bit as I catch up on my asynchronous turns and then later at night when everyone is in bed I can log on for some serious quick matches!\n\ntldr: I cannot reccomend this game enough.","November 29, 2015","true","173.9"," 34 of 42 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","34","42","2","0"

You have to take into account that things might go south, and have a plan b and a plan c. Luck cuts both ways, so even if you think you're about to lose a bit of bad luck for your opponent (or a miraculous 20% cast on your part) could turn things around.\n\nThis is not chess, you can't predict everything that will happen, but you can plan for all situations. The rat might kill the dragon. Unlikely, but this means a game isn't finished until the wizard dies. This also leaves open different strategies:\n1 - build a lot of creatures and try to overwhelm your opponent\n2 - play possum and swoop in with a well-timed magic bolt to clinch it\n3 - block his creatures with an undead while you send an eagle to swoop down and kill his mage from the other side\n4 - block a part of the map with blob/vine/crystal wall or similar, so you can stall the game until you have the upper hand\n...etc\n\nLots of spells, lots to discover, active multiplayer base and the game is bug free.","May 28","true","42.0"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","22","22","0","0"

Simply put this is a pure expression of the sort of formula that Julian Gollop (the creator of this game) has been refining for years.\n\nThe game is essentially a battle between two (or more) wizards where the goal is to eliminate all opposing wizards. You accomplish this via the casting of spells, summoning of creatures and strategic movement over terrain. Every spell cast, or attack made has a chance of failure so you must weigh up the odds all the time and do everything in your power to maximise your chance for success. This makes for a satisfying risk/reward style of play.\n\nThere's quite a lot of tactical depth that comes from what is a fairly simple set of rules that are easy to learn, so I recommened that everyone who enjoys the sound of the above give it a shot, learn the ropes, and you'll have a blast.","October 26, 2015","true","186.9"," 43 of 58 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","43","58","2","0"

At the time of this writing I have a mere 52 hours on record, easily worth the $20 I initially paid.

In many games nowadays the developers hide the RNG but in this game it is honest, in your face, and gives you control over the tools to beat it. In fact, it is this dimension what makes Chaos Reborn more than just an average spam units and the player with the most powerful wins game. Here you have to use your brain and you WILL have to make sacrifices in order to get what you want. This unfortuntately means the game might not be for everyone. For instance, If you’re the kind of person who sees a Dragon Spell with a casting chance of say 30% and thinks ‘this will likely fail but I can spend the mana I will get to make sure my Vampire succeeds’ then this game is probably for you. If, however, you’re the kind of person who see a Dragon at 30% and thinks ‘this is likely going to fail, I’m not okay with that’ then this isn’t the game for you. But if you are able to live with not getting everything you want in life then playing Chaos Reborn is an excellent way to spend your time. The graphics are great, the creatures are varied and many have special abilities that add to the strategic elements along with the various bits of equipment you can pick up along the way. All this means battles are varied, gripping, and anyone who leans some basic tactics can win.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, there are a number of modes to keep you occupied whether it be friendlies, league matches, or jumping into the more RPG based Realms. You can create Custom battles to fight your online friends, or call them for help in a Realm battle.\n\nSo, to conclude, Chaos Reborn really does have something for a lot of gamers and I highly recommend it.\n","May 28","true","597.0"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","0"

Sticking to it's original roots, core gameplay makes heavy use of random chance. The core gameplay of Chaos Reborn sees two to four Wizards, who can be a mix of real players and AI, face off against one another. In order to best your opponent, you are given a number of spells which allow you to summon minions to fight by your side, along with spells that allow you to directly attack, take shelter or even teleport around the map.\n\nBelow is a video of the gameplay between myself and the developer, where we try to demonstrate and explain some of the game's mechanics.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNYanUtVJHo\n\nIt's safe to say now that this game isn't going to be for everyone. The spells you start with are semi-random (but they can be influenced by the equipment that you give to your Wizard). Every spell you wish to cast has a percentage chance to cast and fail. Every direct attack against a creature or another Wizard has a percentage chance to land or miss - and a landed attack will always result in a kill as every creature, including your Wizard only has a single hit point. Many people who are new to Chaos, especially those who aren't willing to put some time into it, get easily frustrated when a few spells fail to cast in a row, even when they have a high chance of success. It happens!\n\nThe thing is, skill is actually a factor. The tournament leader boards have shown that some people can consistently get high win rates. Positioning is a very important tactic. Making sure you don't get yourself trapped in a corner, giving yourself room to escape. Making sure you have the higher ground (making you harder to kill), while at the same time trying to limit your opponents control of the board and trap them in a corner.\n\nWhile spells have a percentage chance to cast, the odds can be improved by using mana to boost casting chance (mana is gained in a number of ways, including discarding spells you have no use for). You can also manipulate the balance between "Law" and "Chaos" by casting spells of the appropriate alignment. As the balance swings towards Law or Chaos, so do the odds of a successful cast of that type increase.\n\nAnother important factor is a bluff mechanic. When a Wizard attempts to summon a creature, they have the option to summon an illusion instead, which always has a 100% chance to work. The illusion looks and behaves just like the real thing in ever way. However, if your opponent suspects that a creature is an illusion, they can choose to "disbelieve" it. If they are correct, the illusion is disbelieved, and they get to cast another spell. However, if they are wrong, they've wasted their casting opportunity on that turn. All of this leads to interesting mind games. Do you want to summon a dragon with only a 20% chance? Do you cast an illusion knowing your opponent will probably call your bluff? Or do you take a gamble, and hope the 1 in 5 chance goes your way and you get a real dragon, probably causing your opponent to waste a turn disbelieving it? Maybe you choose to cast that 90% Goblin as an illusion. Who's going to suspect that a 90% chance creature would be an illusion?\n\nThe game currently has a number of different modes. There are straight up Skirmish matches from 2 to 4 players, or you can make up the numbers with AI opponents. There are ranked and unranked games, friendly (custom) matches so you can set certain rules and just play with your friends), along with the ability to play asynchronous matches (think of it as Chess by Mail), where you can have many games in progress at once. These game modes allow you to choose between "Classic" and "Equipped". Classic gives each player a balanced, default staff, robe and starting hand, meaning that all players start on an equal footing. Equipped mode allows players to use Staffs, Robes and Talismans which have been purchased in game.\n\nAll equipment is purchased using in game currency. There are no micro-transactions,  there is no pay to win. At the time of writing this, the original Kickstarter backer rewards have been left in the client to give those who missed the Kickstarter an opportunity to pick up those rewards. However, these different social tiers offer no gameplay advantage over the vanilla game.\n\nThe Forge Master rank allows a player to make 2 custom sets of equipment. One Staff and Robe at any time, plus a second Staff and Robe at a certain set level. These items can be customised in their appearance and stats from a list of pre-sets and using a points spending system. This means a Forge Master can customise equipment to suit their play style, but can't create something with an unfair advantage. Any items created by Forge Masters also go into the common pool of equipment, meaning that any other player can find or use them.\n\nThe other social levels mainly tie into the game's single player element, The Realms of Chaos. The Realms shouldn't be seen as a story driven campaign, but more of an overworld to join the Wizard Battles together. Once a Wizard enters into a realm, they can travel around the map, defeating lesser "Wizard Lords", defeating or recruiting creature villages, gather gold and equipment and hiring mercenaries, while trying to capture and control various strategic locations. Once the player is strong enough to cast the Breach spell, they can attempt to kill the "Wizard King" to complete the realm and take the loot. Within the realms, players can volunteer as an ally, who can be called upon by another player to aid  them in defeating tricky encounters. Players can also choose to "invade" another realm, and as a result, while playing through a realm, one of those Wizard Lords you encounter may be a real player! (NOTE: You can disable the invader to ensure this never happens, if you don't want other players in your single player game).\n\nSome of the Realms are created by the game's developers, while others are user generated, created by players who have a rank of Wizard King and above. Any player who is a Wizard Lord my have their Wizard act as an AI controlled Lord in a Realm, granting them some passive gold and XP. Any Wizard King, can act as an AI controlled Wizard King within a realm, along with being able to create their own Realms. Players will be able to up or down vote a user created realm, which can allow further promotion of Wizard Kings to Demigods, who are able to lead guilds. From Demigods, players can progress to Gods, who can offer boons to their followers. (NOTE: At the time of writing, Demigod and God functionality are not implemented, but are planned for the next patch). All of these ranks (except Forge Master) can be achieved through gameplay by any player. A God has no in match advantage against an apprentice. The backer rewards just allow players to access these ranks instantly, and also give some cosmetic skins. It is worth noting that players who back these social ranks can never be demoted below the rank at which they backed (You've paid for it, you get to keep it).\n\nAs it stands, Chaos Reborn is an interesting and enjoyable take on turn based strategy that moves away from the every day norm of what you can pick up from the market. The single player could still use some work, and there are one or two creases that need to be ironed out, but the developers are still working on the game, and I am sure those things will come in good time.\n\nAs I said at the start, while skill and strategy are involved, random chance does still play a major roll in this title. If failing a 90% chance spell cast twice in a  row is going to leave you feeling salty, then this game probably isn't for you. However, if you're the kind of person who is able to adapt to the situation, think on the fly, play the odds to your advantage, and who always has a "plan B", then this is a very worth-while title.","November 1, 2015","true","23.9"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/baldrlux/recommended/319050/","baldrlux","NoWorries","http://steamcommunity.com/id/baldrlux/","453 products in account","TL;DR: I enjoy this game immensely. This review summarizes some reasons why.\n\nTHE THEME: At the end of the 14th century, Earth shattered into innumerable fragments in a magic-instigated apocalypse. Powerful magic allows fragments of Earth to endure as habitable, island realms scattered between planes of existence. From a planet called Limbo, wizards and gods engage in eternal conflict over who controls the many, surviving realms of old Earth. Each realm holds the promise of ancient artifacts, lore, and power to fuel the ambitions of wizards and gods alike. It is a feudal, dystopic society of magic users.\n\nTHE DEVELOPER: Chaos Reborn is a rebirth and reimagining of Chaos: The Battle of Wizards (1985) and Lords of Chaos (1990) by their original creator, Julian Gollop. Mr. Gollop is more known for creating the original X-COM: UFO Defense (1994), the widely acclaimed classic which inspired XCOM: Enemy Unknown and many other games. The classic Chaos and X-COM games were rooted upon deep, tactical play. Chaos Reborn is a true successor to both legacies.\n\nTACTICAL GAMEPLAY: I cannot really do the basic gameplay experience justice in a short paragraph. It has too many tactical layers. But at essence, the game involves duels of up to 6 wizards. Wizards can invoke flamboyantly magical spells and summon creatures. Yet wizards themselves are fragile and must be protected. Imagine a three dimensional, multi-layered game of wizard chess with variable numbers and types of pieces which can come and go, and where each attack has a very real chance of failure. But if you lose the wizard, then you lose the game. Sometimes you will lose despite your best efforts, and sometimes you will win because you were lucky rather than good. That said, this game is tactically deep and, over time, rewards players who come to understand and appreciate all of the many, varied tactical approaches to gameplay.\n\nTUTORIAL: There is a tutorial labeled “Wizard Training” in the main menu. It comprises a series of gated set-piece encounters which gradually introduce you to the fundamental mechanics and tactics of the game. Having played the game for hundreds of hours before experiencing the tutorial, I still found it enjoyable. It’s not often that I can say that about a tutorial.\n\nONLINE MULTIPLAYER GAME MODES: Multiplayer wizard duels can be played live or asynchronously with up to 6 players. Matches can be friendly or ranked. And matches can be played Equipped (with custom equipment) or Classic (with standard equipment). Ranked matches allow you to qualify as an "Archmage" at which point you will be given your worldwide rank computed by an ELO scoring method. League standings reset in monthly seasons. Whether friendly or ranked, matches generally go quickly. As for the asynchronous games, these are my favorites. You can have up to 20 asynchronous games going at any time. Each player has many days to complete their turns in a match, but I find matches generally go more quickly than that. After ranked matches were first introduced, I completed 35 ranked async matches in just 3 days, and this was gameplay I managed in bits of free time that I had rather in continuous sittings. (I love, love the asynchronous functionality.) Additionally, players can create custom friendly matches, changing the parameters of the game.\n\nONLINE SINGLEPLAYER: There are developer and player created Realms of Chaos which you can explore online with your wizard. These Realms vary in size and challenge and come with a rating system to help determine which are worth exploring. The essential aspect of this game mode is to explore the map to find and defeat all of the Wizard Lords (AI-controlled mini-bosses) in order to reach and defeat the Wizard King (AI-controlled boss) of the Realm. While you are doing this, the Wizard King and his Wizard Lords summon reinforcements. And if you take too long, the Wizard King can banish you from the Realm. This game mode should not be considered a full-fledged RPG. Think of each of the Realms as puzzles to be solved, and some have stories to tell.\n\nCO-OP: The game creates an internal friends list based upon your Steam friends list. You can also add game-only friends. With these friends, you can invite them to co-op with you in online Realms or in online custom games with up to 6 wizards.\n\nOFFLINE HOTSEAT AND SINGLEPLAYER GAME MODES: There are offline game modes which allow hotseat gameplay against any combination of human or AI-controlled opponents. There is an offline singleplayer campaign. I have not played much of the singleplayer campaign. I find the online Realms experience superior as it integrates with all of the other online features.\n\nGRAPHICS: The game uses the Unity game engine, which should be compatible with most computers. The custom art and animations are quite pretty. And the game really does have its own, unique graphical theme. Don’t rely on me for too much input on this, as I was playing the game when wizards and creatures were represented by crude, unanimated placeholder graphics. But if you really care about graphics, the graphics are good.\n\nIN SUM: As-is, the game is a gem. If you like tactical turn-based games, then spending $20 on Chaos Reborn will get you one of the more fun games in your Steam inventory. If you’ve read this far and the game still intrigues you, then you should get the game.","June 2","true","027.6"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

It's a game which plays very differently to Hit Point-based battlers and the true rewards come from mastery of the game's simple rules and complex combinations of spell decks.

So my perspective is mainly that of a newcomer. I love strategy games, and while I watched a video of it on YouTube I still wasn't 100% sure what playing it would be like.\n\nThe game is deceptively simple in premise - you are a squishy wizard, and you can move, attack and cast a spell (which are generally to summon creatures or deal direct damage) during your turn, and likewise move and attack with any creatures, in any order. The other player(s) - up to 4 total - then take their turns. There is no health - there is just a percentage chance to kill based on the stats. While seemingly simplistic, the gamble is thrilling as you can only really tip the odds in your favour and reduce the risks to your own demise.\n\nCreatures have strengths and weaknesses, and there are spells that provide tactical and defensive advantages as well.\n\nOne thing that does add an extra dimension is when you cast a spell, it has a % chance for success based on the strength of the creature you are summoning. You can choose to cast it as an illusion with 100% success, and it will be just as effective, unless your opponent uses their spell to disbelieve your summon for the illusion it really is. So there is an element of poker going on there too. Your chance to cast creatures depends on the current overall magic-o-meter, which can swing between law and chaos depending on what types of spells the wizards are casting. Neutral spells are not affected by this.\n\nThere looks to be future mechanisms to allow you to change the appearance of your wizard and introduce more RPG elements, but I ended up jumping into frays with experienced players and holding my own quite well.\n\nThe graphics are detailed and not overblown, as is the music and atmosphere, and the UI and overall feel is good and generally well executed - especially for an early access game.\n\nCurrently it's multiplayer (real time or play-by-mail-like) only at present, with single player to come but people seem friendly.\n\nI'd say this game has a lot of longevity and you will find yourself wanting to come back to it time and again. Thoroughly recommended for anyone who wants a modernised and well polished version of old-school strategy at its best :)","December 11, 2014","true","17.0"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

Chaos Reborn as best I could break it down might be Chess... with Stratego elements and a heavy magic:the gathering(? - feel free to insert your more appropriate fantasy style here) skin. Sure I had read the reviews and all but even just getting into the tutorial I realized I hadn't quite grasped the amount of depth to the game possed until I was out into my own matches. The videos most certainly can't do it justice. Depending on your strategy, your skill and yes, your luck matches last anywhere from 2 mins to half an hour and they are all truly, truly enjoyable.\n\nThus we have from the maker of X-com: UFO Defense a quite challenging, yet (in my opinion) well-balanced game with just enough divine intervention from RNGesus to keep you in the moment. I haven't fizzled on this many spells since the original Everquest and when you happen to, it can be heartbreaking and yet exciting. The question we all ask: is it worth the money? (the standard price when not on sale is $20). In my opinion, yes it is. I've found myself skipping over many other large releases this year to give "one more go" at a challenging match.\n\nI should mention this was a kickstarter game if the content everywhere didn't let you know, so you get a perfectly fine and full game for the $19.99 you'd pay if not on sale. Should you pursue upgrades, it would be $15 for "forging skills" (changing the appearance of your character, armor etc, once whenever and once at level 33), $30 for the next tier and $80 for the highest tier, granting exclusive skins, forge tools and few other goodies. I haven't myself yet purchased any but they neither inhibit nor augment any ability to enjoy or compete in the game.\n\nBasically, if you're a turn-based strategy fan, board game type fan, fantasy fan... pick it up. BUT... if you aren't sure - hey guess what? There's a demo, check it out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattyrasker/recommended/319050/","mattyrasker","MattyRasker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mattyrasker/","265 products in account","I have been playing Chaos Reborn since December 2014, I am a fan of XCOM Enemy Unknown, and I didn't play the original Chaos game on the ZX Spectrum. I have also purchased a few Early Access games on Steam. This review has been edited to a review based on the final version, released today.\n\n\nChaos Reborn is a turn based, hex based strategy game. There is a single player mode and a multiplayer mode, but in both modes most of the action happens on a hex tile based board, where you play as a wizard fighting other wizards. You do this through casting creatures and spells using cards, of which you get to play one card per turn. Each creature or spell has a percentage chance of being cast. There is a greater chance of casting a weaker creature / spell than a stronger creature / spell. There are also creatures and spells that are unique to a particular 'alignment' - Law and Chaos. The more Law cards played, the stronger the alignment towards Law, vice versa for Chaos. The stronger the alignment, the higher percentage chance of the stronger cards of that alignment being cast. You can cast 'illusions' which have 100% chance of being cast, but the other wizard(s) can 'disbelieve' your unit if they think you’re being dishonest. This will get rid of the unit and then they cast a card. However, if they 'disbelieve' a unit that is actually real, they lose a chance to cast a creature or a spell. The last wizard standing wins.\n\nThe game is about managing risk, making strategic moves across the board, bluffing and taking chances. The games core mechanics depend on Random Number Generation (RNG), and there is no health bar - everything is one hit kills and the % chance of killing / being killed depends on their attack Vs defence. So, if anyone feels that they would get put off by a game where your Magic Bolt which has a 71% chance of killing the wizard doesn't kill the wizard, but their rat attack of 6% kills you next turn, don't play this game. However, played right you will see that inside there is a deep strategic element that you need to master in order to get the most out of this. Once you have nurtured this the game becomes intensely satisfying.\n\nChaos Reborn’s strengths lie in the Multiplayer Mode – you can play either friendly matches or ranked matches, and you can play them live or asynchronous. You can also choose to play either Classic Mode or Equipped Mode. Classic Mode is where all wizards have the same staff and same bodygear, no special traits. Equipped Mode is where the game really wins for me – you can put together your own Staff and Bodygear combination depending on your preferred way of playing. Like using Law creatures? Use a Law staff. Love using Magic over melee? Use an Arcane bodygear.\nThe Multiplayer matches are, quite simply, great. Full of strategy, tension, bluffing, un-bluffing, and at times, witnessing unbelievable odds that just make the games intense. It’s got wizards, cards, creatures, undead, and above all, magic. I’ve never got myself into a multiplayer as much as I have with Chaos Reborn, I simply love it. Ranked matches are monthly seasons which you can earn XP and gold, but also the chance to get into the ELO rankings and show you are a true wizard. Personally, I am really not that bothered with Rankings. You have to go through a 10 level qualifier every month which if I’m honest bores me a little. You can however play Friendly matches if you are just looking for some fun.\n\nThen there is Realms of Chaos – the single player adventure mode. This is where you can equip your wizard to go into a Realm designed by a Wizard King, and the objective is to defeat the Wizard King and his Lords. You can recruit creatures and settlements to help you, and there are encounters which need decisions being made. There was much doubt on whether this was going to be any good or not. But I think Snapshot have done a fine job – it’s playable and it’s fun. But I can’t help think Snapshot wanted it to be bigger, much bigger, and it feels like that too – a solid single player / adventure mode that is crying out to be much more\n\nThe game is an absolute delight to look at - the graphics are really nice. The music was changed last minute and it is absolutely fantastic. It was composed by George Strezov and was all recorded live, and it is brilliant. Last minute changes were also made for the sound effects – another range of nice little changes.\n\nThe game is still not without its bugs, but no game breaking ones from what I’ve seen in v1.0. Julian has openly said that V1.0 is missing a couple of features that he promised from the Kickstarter but will be added in the next 3 months or so, including Social Ranks and the God / Demi God features (which to be honest, I have no idea what that is going to be!).\n\nAlso, in the release candidate, they made some last minute additions to graphics and Vsync is off by default. As a result, FPS was uncapped and unfortunately my GPU and CPU (GTX 760 / G3258 Dual Core overclocked) were getting smashed. Soon as I turned Vsync on, FPS was capped at 60 FPS and the PC handled with that. Just be aware of this.\n\nIf you fancy getting yourself into the tournaments, head over to lawandchaos.co.uk - The community is really friendly and are always wanting to help new players get into the game.\n\nOverall, I have enjoyed being part of the development journey of Chaos Reborn, and the end result has not disappointed me. I’d even go as far as to say it’s probably one of the best games I’ve ever played (and I’m old – maybe that’s a sign of my taste in games changing!).\n\nHighly recommended – buy it!","February 23, 2015","true","835.1"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","0"

It could best be discribed as Magic the Gathering and Warhammer's love child. I say this as the core of this game is wizard vs wizard duels (both PvP with full tournament support and PvE) played on a hex based, procedurally generated, battle field with one hit kills for everything.\n\nThe matches start with each player only having their wizard, and a "hand" of randomly selected spells from your randomly generated (for the most part) spell book, which is your deck. Each player then spends the rest of the match moving around the battlefield summoning critters and monsters as well as casting spells in an effort to control the map and kill off the other wizards. Matches themselves, are resonably short lasing 10-30 minutes. A simple concept, I know but there is a lot of depth. As everything is killed in one hit there is no truly useless monsters, and as long as you play smart and have a little luck you can go from an almost hopeless situation to a win, or have your dragon get killed by that rat your rival summoned five turns ago and you forgot about. Another mechanic that adds depth to combat is the Illusion system.\n\nIn Chaos Reborn, in general, the more powerful the spell or summon, the lower the chance of the spell working, but summons have the summon illusion option at casting were you can create a fake monster that is just as potent in all ways as a real one and it will always work but with one potentally huge weakness. They can be unmade by a skill everyone will always have access to: Disbeleive, a skill that if used on an illusion, kills it and allows the caster to cast another spell that turn. If it was real; nothing happens and that doubter loses the ability to cast anything else that turn. Thus an illusion heavy army can be wiped out in one turn potenally, and if your willing to gamble on summoning a dragon on turn one, you can trick the other wizard to effectively waste a turn. The right bluff or call of one at the right time can and will win you games!\n\nThere is even going to be an ranking system out side of the traditional leaderboard ladders. In it you can have your wizard climb the ranks so that when you're out of game: you become a mid boss in the single player game, be the boss of a level you design (you get bonus exp and gold if they do well at these jobs,) or even be one of the gods that guilds (the game calls them Orders) sacrifice offerings to in hope you will grant them boons in the forms of various buffs or unlocking loot rich levels for them to pillage. Just be careful though, if you start playing poorly you will be demoted.","May 18, 2015","true","59.8"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Also there's a free demo so you can easily avoid this......\n\nRNG\nThe RNG mechanics can be easily and cleverly manipulated, avoided and hugely improved in your favour during any battle.

Keeping these items persistantly between each realm you play through, collecting more and building your strategies.\n-Exploring a realm is fun and can unlock options of what to do; like more battles, creatures spawning nests to own and send around the map for your benefit, finding strong mecenary creatures.\n-Story moments can have options of what you want to do, how to behave to the situation, gaining you a new merc or some gold, or just allowing you to play your character how you want them to behave.\n\nBreakdown:\n- Graphics  (looks fantastic, the creature designs are nique and look great!)\n- UI  (not only no issues of annoyance with camera's etc, but theres a lot of info provided in sensible ways and easy to find out what you can do, and how things work)\n- Community  (they are friendly, super helpful and can create more content.

But I wish there were more different unit types than current ones available in the game.\n\nAt first when Realms were added to the game, I thought it was a great addition.\nBut after the game was out of early access, I was disappointed how it remained unchanged.\nThe realm still has only grass terrain type (no desert or desolated terrain types)\nand only objective to capture the palace (need more objective than racing over time.)\nThere are some random encounters based on multiple choices. I thought I was actually going to fight skeletons when I chose to protect lions against them but nothing actually happened to me at all,\nthe game just showed text what happened after...

'Chaos Reborn' (2015) delivers, and massively improves upon that original blueprint in every aspect. It's a really clever re-imagining, bringing all of its mechanics up to date and throwing in some ingenious new ones... Recently added new features include: Custom game lobbies, 6 player formats and advanced Co-Op features... and Co-Op Chaos is awesome.\n\nCR is a perfect example of how to design a game that is endlessly re-playable through the concept of randomly generating every battle's starting conditions, creating multiple combinations and varieties of things that can happen in every match, making every battle feel different from the last, this is one of its biggest strengths. I'm not even that much of a fantasy genre fan usually, yet this is my favorite game of all time purely based on its tactical depth and addictive nature, it's the random nature of events that you can manipulate to just the right degree that is so fascinating.\n\nCR is an extremely well constructed game from the same mold as timeless board/card games. The essence of this game shares a great many parallels with poker, and I don't just mean because it gives you the same kind of thrills 'n' spills as you get with bluffing/gambling etc, although that does help! Psychology can play a big part in success, which is highly rewarding. The same elements that make poker a classic strategy game make this a classic strategy game. Any players just discovering this game who have online poker experience (or a history in tabletop gaming) will totally get it right away....\n\nThe overall balance within the game is one of the things that stands out the most, you can really feel how much thought and effort has gone into delicately balancing the character stats, spell stats, creature stats and special abilities etc... all of the unit classes and individual unit abilities are really well designed and defined. The core game is highly refined, this is what makes it a tactical masterpiece...\n\n...welcome to the the holy grail of TBS games.","June 2","true","888.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

I've never understood why people would want to spend money on an unfinished product - one which they might ruin for themselves if they play early - rather than hold off and wait unitl the experience is complete. However, Chaos Reborn is the only exception, in my opinion.\n\nThe game itself is a simple, yet deep, turn-based strategy game. You control a wizard, and you can battle up to three others - or challenge a team of two with a partner - both online and off.\n\nEach turn, you are given the chance to cast one of a selection of spells at your disposal. These could be anything from magic bolts to summoning various creatures. In order to win the game, you have to land one successful hit to kill the opposition wizard, and this can come from a creature, a spell, or your own wizard himself. This concept is extremely simple and easy to grasp, but it is the strategy elements on top of it that make it brilliant.\n\nEvery spell comes with a successful cast percentage. Weak monsters and abilities will have around a 70-80% chance of success, whereas stronger beasts and more elaborate spells have a much lower chance of working. This would make the game all about luck if it wasn't for one ingenious addition - illusions.\n\nBefore summoning a monster, you have the choice of attempting to summon a real one, with a limited success chance, or casting an illusion of it. Illusions have a 100% success rate, and they can move, attack, and defend just like their real conterparts. However, each opponent has a spell called 'Disbelieve' availible to them in every turn, and if they cast on something they think is an illusion, it will be removed from the game, and they'll be allowed to cast another spell. However, if they Disbelieve a real monster, it will remain on the field, and they'll lose their ability to cast another spell that turn. This fantastic mechanic leads to some incredidbly tense mind games, as you'll constantly be trying to get into the mind of your opponent in order to work out whether their army is real, or a simple bluff.\n\nThese mind games are all in good fun, though. The community is easily the best I've ever encountered while playing a game. I have yet to run into someone who isn't friendly. No one leaves games halfway through, no one complains when they lose - it's an extremely refreshing thing to see in this day and age.\n\nIf you are put off by it being in Early Access - do not fear! The game is extremely polished - all that is missing is the ability to customise your wizard and spells, but this arguably improves the game, as everyone is on a level playing field.\n\nThe only negative is that it is sometimes hard to find games online. You can almost always find a 1v1 match, but 1v1v1 and any four player games are extremely hard to come by, and plaiyng offline in these modes just won't give you the same thrill.\n\nChaos Reborn is the perfect strategy game. Extremely original, perfectly balanced, and oh-so addictive - if you give this a shot, you won't be disapointed.","January 31, 2015","true","12.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Online battles (the only game mode really worth mentioning at the moment; single player is still basically practice mode and provides no rewards) are now skewed in several ways. Law has a superior spell set, and nearly everyone I've encountered is therefore playing law, which makes for boring matchups. The new system of wizard and gear leveling was thrown into all matchmaking options, so new wizards can expect to be frequently paired up against level 30+ opponents with bigger hands, bigger decks, and spells and talisman abilities that require a good deal of grinding to acquire. And yes, the game has become very grindy. There have also been some questionable changes to the line-of-sight formula, which is now driven by a ruleset whose results are frequently counter-intuitive, also to the detriment of new players; example: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=437410639 Hopefully these are just growing pains, and the balance and easy-to-pick-up nature of the game will be restored soon. I still recommend this game to hex strategy and RPG fanatics based on its future features (development definitely seems to be on track), but I strongly suggest waiting out these kinks before taking your first plunge.\n\n[Update for 12/22 patch]\nThe most impressive game project I've had the pleasure of backing on Kickstarter. Development is moving swiftly and productively, and the latest Steam Early Access version now includes an offline play option with support for up to 4 human or AI opponents in addition to the existing online multiplayer options. This is essentially a hotseat mode but is limited to free for all, with no team play option yet. This combined with the rudimentary but passable AI make it great for learning the game or battling it out with friends, but you'll still have to rely on matchmaking to scratch that co-op itch. This release also brings us some new spells, showcases a new environment skin, and adds some seasonal holiday details to some of the creature models. A handy play guide is now also featured on the launch screen to help get started, and is highly recommended reading for every new player.\n\nThe final feature set will be nothing short of stellar at this pace. The devs care about just about everything, and that is already beginning to show throughout. I'm focusing on quality and development here because the fundamental concept is already rock-solid: turn-based wizard hex strategy with spell decks plus all the usual online roleplaying frills (guilds, gear, pvp/pve) PLUS a social ladder in which you can become a king or even a god, design your realm, and act as an NPC opponent when you're offline (and customize, track, and be rewarded for your performance as such!). If you're not sold already, then you are definitely in the wrong place.\n\nA few other points are worth mentioning here. The temporary, placeholder leveling system in use now doesn't take long to max, but will be fully replaced (likely accompanied by a stat reset). The game does not have native controller support, although it has been suggested that it may make the final feature set. It is rather easy to map with Xpadder or the like in the meantime.\n\nAll in all, if you have even the slightest love of roleplaying or strategy games, this is one you will want in your Steam library sooner or later.","December 12, 2014","true","135.4"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

There is a wide variety of game modes that include coop, pvp, and invasions. The first two are self-explanatory but the invasions are similar to dark souls. You can invade another persons single player game and take control of one of the AI wizards. You can also volunteer to become an ally instead. Keep in mind you can disable this completely if you want to play without interruptions.\n\nYou control wizard(s) and cast spells in a turn-based format. The objective is to kill the enemy wizards. The gameplay is simple and well explained in the expansive tutorial; however, the point of contention is the RNG or luck. Everyone has 1 hit point and your spells have percentage chances to cast. This makes the game feel like a mix between Chess and Poker. The movements of the wizard and casted minions are strategic, but you must manage your RNG appropriately. You need to make the right decisions and try your best to account for mistakes. 1 HP means that any attack landing will be a death.\n\nThis is a remake to the classic game Chaos and it lives up to its namesake. You need to manage your luck, not control it and take your losses on the chin. There is a ton of replayability, between realms and the various pvp. The bar for entry is very low and not intimidating, so it's worth giving it a shot if you enjoy turn-based games heavily wrapped in luck.

The tactical combat looks like HoMM but is much more fun. It compares favourably to my other favourite turnbased game of this era, the Kings Bounty games. But the game that this reminds me of most of all is another favourite, Disciples 2. This is coming from someone who hates and won't play Disciples 3.\n\nBasically in this game you control a wizard on a hex grid. You will have  a few small units to assist you and the wizard summons more allies or casts spells. Each spell cast has a % chance to succeed, so there's a luck element too. The tactical combat is highly polished and enjoyable. Hell, even the tutorials were fun!\n\nThis game is mainly geared towards multiplayer, which I haven't even touched yet, but old school players like me need not despair. There IS a large singleplayer component. This is the Realms mode, bascially dev or user made maps that really remind me of the strategic layer of Disciples 2, which was so much fun to play 10+ years ago.

I played it myself on some emulators, and it was great. A short while later, I hear that Julian was bringing the series back! I was so excited that I immediately supported the Kickstarter. Here is my review on how it is currently.\n\nPROS:\nGood visuals: The game is still being polished, but it doesn't look too bad already. If these were/are the graphics in the release version, I'd be content with it.\nGood combat system: The game plays very well, and I find myself getting beaten despite holding the lead. Anything can turn the tide of battle, and in a game about wizards, that is to be expected and welcomed.\nSpells: The spells are fairly varied, and you learn to play the game quickly when handed a random deck (as of the time of this review).\n\nCONS:\nBalance: Some spells occasionally seem a bit overpowered if not handled correctly (I'm looking at you, gooey blob), but this is still an Early Access game, and Gooey Blob has always been evil, so this is only a problem for some.\nBarebones (For Now): This only pertains to the Day-1 Early Access version so far. The game only has Multiplayer, and no customization. However, this is obviously slated to be changed in future updates, so it isn't much of a problem.\n\nOVERALL:\nGet this game.

Once you realise that, and develop a playstyle accordingly (such as being a defensive player who plans for the worst - such as the enemy wizard having a bolt, or a blob if you get to close to him) then you'll really appreciate how deep the game is.

You achieve victory by summoning minions and casting spells. Layered on top of this is a light meta game in which you can level up and increase your pool of available minions and spells.\n\nYou will be assigned a semi-random selection of minions and spells at the start of each match (out of the pool which you have unlocked from the aforementioned meta game) which you can cast in any order you wish. The successful casting of spells/summons is not a given, each spell/summon has a base chance to cast; with the lower tier spell/summons having a much higher chance than the higher tier ones. For instance, a weak minion will have a 90% chance to summon, whereas a powerful minion will have a 40% chance to summon. Each wizard can attempt a spell/summon only once per turn, so the player has to balance the risk/reward of each spell/summon in their pool before acting.\n\nThe combat works in a similar, chance based fashion. All chances are clearly displayed to the player before attempting any action so there is no chance of frustration occurring from hidden information. The combat chances are based of the stats of the creatures in question, details of any creature on the board (or in the players hand) can be found during play.\n\nThere are some interesting mechanical twists however! A player can choose to create an illusionary summon which will always have a 100% chance of success and can attack as normal. The downside of this is that an opponent can call your bluff and cast a spell which removes this creature from the board. If the opponent successfully casts this spell on a creature which was summoned as an illusion then they can cast another spell in the same turn! This creates a further layer of strategy which really adds a lot of depth and longevity to the game.\n\nThe core gameplay of fighting against other wizards (whether human or AI) is well designed and realized and the layered meta game is passable, if not exactly ground breaking. However, for the price point it's a great deal.\n\nNow on to the less good stuff:\n\nThe UX design leaves something to be desired, there are several points where you end up in a menu with no way to go back. This is especially evident in the tutorial area where you unlock single player challenges. You will click on a challenge to find out what it's conditions are, but instead of opening a dialogue explaining the challenge and asking you to accept, it just loads straight into the challenge - requiring you to exit to main menu if you didn't actually wish to DO the challenge. These kind of UX decisions are prevalent throughout the menus in the game (but fortunately not in the battle menus!).\n\nThe graphics, while pretty, are not making it particularly easy to read the board. Units don't "pop" from the background and it's hard to tell each players units from one another.\n\nThe tutorial forces you to complete each stage before continuing to the next. I found myself failing a few times on a specific stage, even though I had learned the mechanic. I wanted to carry on and learn the next mechanic so I could practice in a real game rather than the spoon fed tutorial section, but it wouldn't allow me to until I completed the current section.\n\nThe sound is good, if not particularly memorable. I swear the sound effect when you receive a new card/press "escape" when focussed in the chat box is the same one I heard in Starcraft 2 somewhere, probably just me tripping though.\n\nFinally, when I first entered the game (after completing the tutorial), I was met with a menu which linked to several sub menus. Some of these sub menus appeared to be micro transaction menus, although apparently they are not. One of the mechanics - forging your own staff and robe, is locked unless you pay $15... apparently though it's not at all required. So I am really confused as to the design decisions of this area. Also the Upgrade Tiers are really confusingly worded.\n\nAll in all, I'm happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone interested in tactics games, especially if you want to play them competitively online with leagues etc. Maybe buy the forge upgrade, but avoid the two upgrade tiers above this as they are purely cosmetic (I bought them thinking they added some mechanics, turns out it's just tiny cosmetic details, kinda regret it now).\n\nTo the devs: If you add further cards later down the line, consider making them a free DLC for people who upgraded to the higher upgrade tiers or kickstarted the game.","October 29, 2015","true","26.9"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","19","25","0","1"

I'll be trying to get back into the game and at least take a few turns a day. but other than the tutorial, the game is largely the same as when i wrote this review.\n\nHow I was introduced to the game\nHaving never played the original game, I wasn't quiet sure what to expect. To be frank, the only reason i gave this game a second glance was because of the art style. After seeing it was from the creator of the original x-com I decided it was worth keeping an eye on. added to wishlist It was on my wishlist for months before just recently a payday lined up with the most recent sale, and given steams new refund policies I decided i may as well give it a go.\n\nHOLLY ♥♥♥♥ I SHOULDN’T HAVE WAITED THIS LONG TO BUY THE GAME\nThis game is a very easy game to pick up on, and very difficult to master. Given the nature of the game, there is some dumb luck involved, but the game lets you choose where to where to lean that luck towards. It is primarily multiplayer but in 0.28 a single player campaign has been introduced that allows you to go on quests and fight wizards leading up to bosses and such. This single player mdoe does however have multiplayer elements, allowing you to request help from a fellow player at the cost of a small fee and half the rewards of the battle.\n\nHow it plays so far\nThis game is very much a digital board game. You are a wizard facing off against one (or more in some multiplayer matches) other wizard, with an arsenal of spells in the form of cards. It is turn based tactics with percentage based spells, that you can increase chances of succeeding casting in a few ways. Creatures also have percentage chances of destroying other creatures, based on their respective stats. Meaning, yes, a rat CAN kill a Hydra, but it is very unlikely (6% chance if I'm not mistaken).\n\nCards\nEach card has a base percentage that represents the chance you have of successfully casting the spell. The percentages can change based on the influence of the field at any given time. Each card is one of three types. Law, Chaos, or neutral. If a spell of either law or chaos is successfully cast, then the overall influence of the field will change in favor of that type. However, a neutral card will not change the influence one way or another. These cards are chosen randomly, tho evenly, with the exceptions being cards you have forced in your deck from talismans that can be equipped to your staff and robe, and two spells called Disbelieve and Dispel. The first is a spell that you always have, that you can use on an enemy creature if you think they are an illusion, and the second you can use to dismiss your own creatures for mana in return.","July 13, 2015","true","206.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

Perfectly balanced gameplay where a level 1 wizard is as dangerous as the highest levels. It's everything you want an alpha build to be, this purchase does not disappoint.\n\nNever before have I encountered a game that encapsulates and represents the vision and genius of a master game crafter in so perfect a way.\n\nTwo wizards circling, pitting all their guile, wits  and bravado against the other. One wrong move, one poorly executed spell, just one bluff seen through for exactly what it is will end in defeat. The Red Wizard has built an intricate defense on high ground. An elf and manticore defend the high ground between the shadow woods and behind all this the Red Wizard stands. Is he attempting to force a draw?\n\nBlue Wizard studies the defense, sitting astride his manticore on the opposite high ground he has summoned a hydra to his right hand. He notes one space between the chimera and elf that he can occupy, to cut down the opposing creatures and shadow tree that defends Red Wizard will be a task.\n\nBlue Wizard gambles all. He charges his magickal staff to maximum by dumping all of his remaining spells and creature invocations into it and pulls out a grand spell card, Mega Bolt. His manticore leaps, flying across the valley and landing itself and Blue Wizard on the single, empty space. The Mega Bolt flashes, striking the elf, manticore and shadow tree but when the smoke clears the valiant manticore still stands, only to be ended by your faithul mount's physical attack.\n\nRed looks on in obvious panic at Blue who now commands the immediate high ground with victory gleaming in his eyes. Red lets loose an arrow from his Magic Bow, it fails to find a target. He casts his last hope, Magic Bolt, alas it fails also and in despair he runs only to be leapt upon by Blue Wizard who thrust his Magic Sword through Red's chest, for dramatic effect of course.\n\nAnd don't for one second think having more powerful spells and creatures than your opponent can help you win. I'm building a nice win/loss ratio but can still be taken down by level 1's who are "playing my first game".\n\n10/10 and it's only alpha!","December 11, 2014","true","107.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

It's primarily a multiplayer game, and the player base is miniscule and already dwindling\n2. The adventure map mode called "Realms" is a just a poorly curated collection of user created content\n3. The mechanics of the "Realms" are not in line with the rest of the strategy.

It is all about illusions and whether or not yyou can believe that something they summon is real and would do dame to you or you're minions, or just an illusion, basically a tactical bluffing game. The fantastic thing about this game is every person has 1 health and if you get hit, that's it! But there is a percentage of a chance for you to get hit.  You can use mounts to keep your wizard alive but if that mount gets hit then you're on the ground and have only one more hit to take!\n\nThe way defense vs strength vs agility and magic resistance works in this game is that changes the percentage chance you have to hit. The height of your units also plays a role in the percentage and you can use mana to boost spells as well. You can either sacrifice cards to get mana or you can pick up one of the mana sprites that spawn in the maps.","December 10, 2014","true","11.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

To be honest I never stopped playing it. There have always been enough emulators and remakes on various devices to allow me to keep playing even when the Spectrum long ago retired to the attic.\n\nChaos is a mixture of poker and 3d battle chess, but that hardly does the game justice at all. You and your opponents each control a wizard on a hex map. Each turn you can summon creatures to fight for you, use direct magic attacks against your opponents, or create gooey blobs that spread across the map covering everything in deadly goo.\n\nEven though there is an enormous amount of randomness that determines whether each spell or attack succeeds or fails, there are always strategies that give you the best chance of staying alive one more turn. It's always been a key feature of Chaos that you're never dead until you're dead. Last turn reversals are par for the course. The more you push for the win the more vulnerable you are to a lucky retaliation.\n\nJulian Gollop is my favourite game designer bar none. I've been playing his games since 1983, from Chaos to Rebelstar to XCOM and beyond. I was absolutely delighted to back the Kickstarter last Spring 2014 and the progress that has been made since then has not disappointed in any way. The art style is unique. The animations are beautiful. The sound effects are top notch.\n\nThe thing about Chaos is it never gets old - unlike me. The replayability comes from the almost infinite combinations of randomness in the way the game can play out with bluffs, double-bluffs and triple-bluffs. I'd recommend the game to anyone who would enjoy chess if it were pretty and more... chaotic, or anyone who likes the randomness and bluffing in poker but wants more strategy. It's a unique genre all of its own in my opinion and I fully expect to be playing the game for years to come.\n\nAll hail the blob!","December 16, 2014","true","606.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Realising that the game is largely driven around RNG rather then healthpoints or other RPG troeps initially sounds unappealing, yet the game's art style and manner of managing combat makes the game a definite Steam gem which Gabe himself should take a look into!\n\nPros\n\n+The art style and animations is truly wondrous to look at. I can not stress just how little credit the screen shots give the artstyle! In game i am both amused and awestruck by just how beautiful the renditions of the sprites are,\n\n+Online offline modes leave to varied gameplay, as just ai would obviously be a bit of a bummer. AI are intelligent though and a good challenge to beginners, which i am at the moment.\n\n+Staff abilities; when one has enough manner they gain the ability to gain a special card which, once played, can easily turn the tide of the skirmish, thus forcing players to reach for the gems mid board in an attempt to increase their magic pool.\n\n+In game audio is well worth listening to, it is 'realistic', so no strange squeeks or grunts which ruin immersion from grunts.\n\n+The Soundtrack is just fantastic, the music changes from a mellow calm undertone, to a heroic fanfare, spurring the most valient of Wizards onwards to victory!\n\nCons\n\n-RNG could begin to grind on some people's gears, the notion that your entire plan could be lost due to a few  jammy rats could be a negative to some who prefer 'safer' gameplay.\n\n-Repetition? Whilst online games are varied in terms of the opponent you face, single player games (if you have bad internet) could be poor in terms of ai repeating themselves?

Games are extremely fast-paced and can literally turn on one lucky (or unlucky) moment.\n\nI love that so much of the flavour of the old game is present and many of the spells have made it too - such as the infamous gooey blob.  I am, however, hopeful that the even-more-frenetic pace of this game compared to its forebears won't rule out the appearance of a few more of the old favourites  as the deck actually seems reduced in variety from the earlier editions (no zombie, spectre or wraith, for example - at least, from what I've seen so far).\n\nI also like the fact that some of the more-RPG influenced elements from another seminal Gollop work - Lords of Chaos - have made it in to this game.  Realms mode looks to have massive potential.\n\nIt's early doors yet, but a fantastically promising start here with what I genuinely hope is a classic in the making.\n\nEDIT: 08/11 20 or so hours in.\n\nThis is actually quite different to my initial expectations.  I thought some of the depth from Chaos & Lords of Chaos had been lost due (for example) to a lesser variety of spells and no potion creating.\n\nI should have known better than to doubt the Gollop.  The depth in this game comes from the MASSIVELY customisable playstyles afforded by the different armour/staff combinations and the talismans you use with them.  Want to be a melee-centric hard-♥♥♥?  No problem.  Ever fancied yourself as an undead, rubbing shoulders with a horde of likewise lifeless minions?  Go for it.\n\nYes, we all fall foul of RNGesus from time to time (my ally in realms co-op who summoned a Hydra on a 20% chance then saw it instantly one-shotted by an Elf would attest to this) but it's the beauty of the beast!

The game has been in early access for quite some time now and it was just recently announced that the game would be officially released at the end of this month.  Since the very beginning I have love the artwork and gameplay.  The artwork while being somewhat minimal in detail, does a great job for creating a uniqueness in the visual design.  The gameplay is turn based which doesn't seem quite as popular these days, but it is handled in such a manner that it doesn't feel like a con.  I should note that the original Chaos was also turn based so this one is as well in trying to stay somewhat true to the original.  In every turn a wizard and creatures (if you have summoned any) are allowed one move and one attack.  The wizard also gets one cast per turn.  Each spell has a given percentage rate of success which can be boosted by earning mana from failing spell casts, acquiring mana sprites, discarding cards, or killing enemy creatures.  Spells of either Law or Chaos alignment will also start to get increases to the chance of success depending on the alignment.  Alignment changes as spells/creatures of either Law or Chaos alignment are successfully cast.  There can be a bit of a learning curve in the beginning but once this is overcome the game is exceptionally enjoyable and in my personal opinion, very unique.  Something else to take note of is the community for this game.  It is by far the best community I have come across for any game I have played to date.  Whether on the forums or on the community site ( http://lawandchaos.co.uk/ ), everyone is extremely helpful and very pleasant to chat with.  Feel free to check out my Chaos Reborn videos here: https://www.youtube.com/user/auzariusz\n\nPros\nThere is a variety of game modes to choose from.  1v1, 1v1v1 (3 person FFA), 1v1v1v1 (4 person FFA), 2v2 (team battle).  There is also the normal live match style or the asynchronous match style.  Asynchronous matches can be played at your convenience.  You could pop on and play one turn a day against your opponent if you chose to, but they can also be played live if your opponent would happen to be online at the same time.  It is an excellent choice if you are not sure if you will have time to finish a given match or want to have several matches going at the same time.\n\nThe forge system (an optional upgrade) allows you to create custom gear.  I like this one because you can customize the appearance and sockets to your liking.  The downside that has been noted here is that it could be mistaken for pay to win.  No one build will win them all and this is merely an optional tool for players to use if they are enjoying the game.   The forge does not offer any stat increases over already available equipment.  It also adds forge created items into the publicly available item pool, hence allowing other players to acquire them.  This is a pretty awesome feature!\n\nThe separation of classic chaos and RPG chaos (equipped mode).  Classic chaos allows you to go into a match against another wizard without custom equipment and it gives you a random mega spell.  This keeps players on relatively equal footing and seems to be the preferred method of play in early access.  Equipped mode allows you to earn gold by playing in the ranked matches or playing the single player.  You can use the gold to buy random equipment packs and also purchase items in the single player maps as you complete them.\n\nThe artwork is superb as I have noted above.  It provides a very unique aesthetic to the visual experience and I have found it very enjoyable.  This is one of very few games I find myself constantly coming back to and playing matches with others.\nThe community is exceptional.  If you happen to have any questions or just want to play against someone who will try to teach you the gameplay mechanics then don't hesitate to visit http://forum.chaos-reborn.com or the community sites chat client at http://lawandchaos.co.uk/ (you will have to create an account and login on the main page ).  You can also check out this video from UnstableVoltage for some gameplay tips:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcPjPRstLho\nYou can also check out this Straight forward guide by d00m.\n\nCons\nThe single player while being a nice addition to the game, can be very confusing at first and also at times possibly frustrating.  It does feel somewhat incomplete and is not nearly as enjoyable as the multiplayer aspect of the game.  I would easily say that if you are not interested in the multiplayer portion that this game may not be for you; however, I am sure there are some lets plays out there that play through some of the single player so it is just something to be aware of.  UnstableVoltage also has a video going through the single player realms here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LINbzEWlE4Y\n\nServer lag.  While this does not ruin the game since it is turn based.  It can create a delay in the execution of your moves leaving you feeling like the game just broke or something.  This one is just something to remember.  Chances are if you executed an attack or movement and it didn't happen right away that the server is experiencing lag and the action should happen within the next few seconds.\n\nI don't know if this is really a con or more just bad luck but sometimes the RNG (random number generator) can feel somewhat merciless.  There are just matches where it will seem like almost every spell fails regardless of success chance (like a 96% success dwarf or something).  This will likely happen to you at some point but overall not really a con.\n\nConclusion\nI can say that I would easily recommend this game.  It feels very well done even though there is still quite a bit more development ahead for the social features.  I strongly recommend joining the community for playing matches as it can be a lot more fun that simply using the match maker all of the time.  Please feel free to leave comments on this review.  :)\n\n\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n\nGreat gameplay and a cool concept!\nI will go into greater detail at another time, for now all I can say is that I have been enjoying the game!  I just wanted to list a few cons that I have noticed just so other users can be aware.  I doubt that anything I list here has been missed in the other reviews though.  I think that the game has grown pretty steadily since I began playing a few months back.  I still enjoy the game just as much if not more than when I first started playing.  The community is probably the best that I have come across in the gaming community.  They are active on the forums and while there are varied oppinions and some are more vehement than others, it doesn't resort to trolling and bashing like you usually see on the forums.  http://lawandchaos.co.uk is a great community site that provides information for Chaos Reborn and also a tournament client to facilitate communication between those who play Chaos Reborn (there is currently no ingame chat system or friends list - that is all facilitated by using the Steam overlay).  There is also other great information out there like this video that UnstableVoltage put together for the 0.26 patch to help new players understand the game.  There is also this straight forward guide that d00m posted here on steam.  For anyone who is on the edge about buying the game, I encourage you to take the plunge.  I know for me it has been well worth it and I imagine most would agree with that.  I have posted most of my matches up on youtube here if anyone is curious about the gameplay.\n\n[...] (the rest got cut off by steams character limit x.x)","February 22, 2015","true","241.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","3"

Spells are (currently) randomly selected and allocated at the start of the game.\n\nThe strategy is affected by probability - each spell has a chance of success (and therefore failure) and a single successful attack will kill a wizard, therefore at each juncture you need to consider 'what if'?  Naturally, better spells are more prone to failing. This makes for tense games where you can, depending on your desire for comedy or awareness of tragedy, happily go for the 1,000,000:1 shot or situation permitting, attempt to amass an army.\n\nI've been playing this since the Alpha was launched shortly after the successful Kickstarter campaign finished (April/May 2014) and can easily say that I have played this more than any other game in the past year. If in doubt as to whether this is for you there are plenty of gameplay videos out there, and i'd strongly recommend taking a look.","February 9, 2015","true","536.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Don't be fooled by anyone claiming the outcome is determined by luck.  The most important skills required are risk management and psychology (bluffing), and only to a lesser extent strategy.  Even though the game has many elements of board games and turn-based strategy, I believe it will appeal more to the poker crowd.  The main developer, Julian Gollop, is most know as the man who made the original X-Com, just don't expect this to be an X-Com type game.\n\nPersonally I don't really like the single player realms all that much.  But I spent more than 600 hours in the multiplayer, so no need to tell you how much I like it.\n\nChaos Reborn is a remake (re-imagining) of the original Chaos on ZX Spectrum.  So, you're fighting turn-based battle between wizards.  Each turn, a wizard can move once, attack once and cast 1 spell, in any given order.  Same for a wizard's minions (from earlier spells), except they cannot cast spells.  The game uses a RNG (random number generator) to determine the outcome of actions taken, but gives you your chances in advance.  Spells have a % chance to be cast successfully, with more powerful spells having a lower base %.   Creatures and wizards have no health bar, so 1 successful hit will always kill them., which increases tension.  All creatures have a variety of meaningful stats : offence, defence, agility, magic power, movement speed.  Some can even be used as a mount for the wizard. :)\n\nThe game is easy to pick up, the manual should tell you enough to understand the game mechanics.  On the other hand, it's hard to master.  Firstly because you need to learn all the cards.  And secondly, because there is more complexity then one would think at first : law vs chaos balance effecting spells of both sides, mana pools strategically spread around the map, the possibility to cast illusions, ...  There are 2 distinct game types : classic (both wizards get a random deck) and equipped (where you can use equipment to remove some of the randomness), and either can be played ranked or friendly.  For new players I recommend classic, because equiped will put you at a huge disadvantage against veteran players.\n\nSince the last update, you can play an even wider variety of multiplayer modes, with up to 6 players per game..  2P can provide a quick, casual game.  3P and 2vs2 are generally more enjoyable and strategic.  But for me, 4P is the bread and butter of this game, often leading to some epic battles.  And regularly, a sinjgle spell ends up switching the entire balance of a game.  I haven't played enough 5 or 6 player games to comment on those.  The online match maker is very intuitive and easy to use.","December 12, 2014","true","651.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Gives me all of the turn based tactical goodness that i could ever want in a format that doesn't demand a whole afternoon to have a satisfying game session. The way this works is through subtle but genious game mechanics...perhaps seemingly obtuse at first. The game teaches you the basics in an indepth tutorial (wizard training) but below what might at first seem "OMFG! TOO MUCH RNG!" will eventually turn into a deep love for the game if you manage to learn the nuances. The nuances come in taking advantage of the smaller details like...A tall unit blocking line of sight, receiving mana for failed casts (the lower the % of success, the more mana given), the engage system, dispelling troops to open up extra attacking opportunities, creatures shifting chaos/law alignment regardless if it's an illusion or not, casting an illusion pegasus to ensure an extra hit can be taken by the paladin's retaliate....Great stuff!\n\nOtherwise with recent additions you have a robust coop system which allows you to tackle harder PVE realms with a pal, or invite them for some crazy 6 wizard action.\n\nOverall it's just a fun game, very unique and worthy of your time. A generous demo is also available on steam, which allows you access to pretty much all that i've been yammering on about (except the realms and coop...PVP is the main attraction of this game though)","June 2","true","301.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Randomness plays an important role in the game, so you have to think about tactics and probabilities. If you get easily frustrated because you think a 3% attack from a rat should never be able to kill your draon this game isn't for you.\n\nGameplay\n\nEach game starts with two (or more in multiplayer) wizards on a small map, and each wizard has a random deck of cards. Those cards are spells that have certain odds to succeed. The odds can be boosted by using mana. Mana is gained by killing creatures, failing to cast a spell, and collecting mana sprites. Wizards with different staffs get different "mega spells" they can "buy" for 60 or more mana points.\n\nAll creatures can be cast with a 100% success rate as illusions that behave exactly like normal creatures, except that the opposing wizard can disbelieve them, which makes them vanish and gives the wizard the opportunity to cast another spell in the same round. However, when disbelieve is cast on a real creature nothing happens, and no other spell is possibly this round.\n\nSo, additionally to the usual strategic thoughts in games (how to position units, how to attack/defend) you have to make many decisions like:\n\n- Should I create a weak monster with a high probability, or should I try for a big bad one with only a 30% chance of succeeding?\n- Should I burn cards I find useless to boost the odds of a hard spell?\n- Should I move aggresively to secure the mana sprites?\n- Is that dragon my enemy just cast real? Should I risk trying to disbelieve it? Do I even care if it's real or not? (It's a dragon, you probably do)\n\nThe last point shows why this game is very much about knowing and reading your opponent. It can be a psychological game of bluffing and calling bluffs.\n\nTo me, this game is similar to X-COM but better because:\n\n- The turn mechanic is better, you can move once, attack once, and cast one spell every round, in any order. Your minions can do the same except they can't cast spells.\n- In online matches you don't have to carefully explore the map. You always see the entire map, this makes the game faster. Online duels default to a 20 turn limit.\n- It has wizards and dragons.\n- Oh yeah, I tried online games with X-COM and didn't like them much.","June 3","true","319.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The current "one hit point and done" state for all players and creatures takes away any scaling strength or defense and reduces the battles to hit %'s. In other words, the game is more often than not is not less about strategy and more about chance.\n\nThere's nothing less satisfying than winning or losing strategic games largely by chance. In the case of Chaos reborn, it could not be made more clear that chance is overwhelmingly more important a factor than strategy. This game is a 'One hit or nothing" style, where players and creatures alike have but 1 hit point, and hit chance is clearly displayed when making any move. This places the player who takes the first turn at an unreasonable advantage, allowing them to move toward objectives or higher ground before the opponent can react, as well as cast creatures which then may get the first attack. If a player manages to successfully cast a powerful creature early (you guessed it, spell casting it chance based), or even a ranged creature placed at highest ground on turn 1, the game is often already over. On the other side of the coin,  there will be many situations where one player has an overwhelming advantage, either through attrition or unbalanced luck of chance, and will be standing right next to the opponent with multiple powerful creatures, attacking with 50-70% hit chances, to have all of them miss, followed by all of the opponent's lower-chance spells and attacks hitting successively the next turn to flip the game upside down, all with no apparent strategy involved.","April 11, 2015","false","4.7"," 41 of 74 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","41","74","2","4"

Potential players have to have in mind that this is not, however, a 'pure tactics' game; it's also definitely not a single player game: it shines the most when you're facing another human willing to take risks, make all-too-safe plays, and play around with expectations.\n\nNow, why, if it's not a 'pure tactics' game, it's so good and smart?\n\nChance is very important here, but not in a quantitative sense. It's important qualitatively: if you play well enough, chance shouldn't mess up your long-term plans, but if you're in a tight spot or want to make a very, very risky play that will be completely unexpected to your enemy, you can pull some incredibly exciting moves off, the kind that only a tactics game that includes chance operations can offer. You're not playing chess here - all rational, all abstract - but a version of it that allows for intuition to have its say, giving you room to improvise and do stupid/smart plays that would never work in more rigid games.\n\nThe rules are extremely simple (one hit, one kill), and the card system offers a depth born precisely from randomness: every game is different, because every game you get an entirely different set of cards. Thus, you can't really have a pre-determined tactical plan, turning the usual 'base' of tactics games completely around (I mean, even Blood Bowl has cages) by asking you, from the outset, to think laterally. This also means you'll sometimes get weird card combinations you just have to make work, and that's where the more traditional tactical thinking plays a major role: how do I use this Dwarf card with this Evil Forest card, in this terrain, considering my enemy's positions? This is where Chaos Reborn's particular brilliance comes through - it asks you to continuously think vertically ("My rat pack will neutralize this spider for two turns") and laterally ("What if I use this magic sword card on myself, dangerously close in, and kill that skeleton my units can't hurt? Is the risk worth it?").\n\nAll in all, if you love tactics games and don't find chance frustrating but actually exciting, this is THE game for you. If you're looking for a chess variant, this might not be for you, but I'd still urge you to give it a shot anyway - maybe chance will work its magic on you!","November 21, 2015","true","46.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

You have the possiblity to simply cast any creature as illussion, it will work and function like a real one and the enemy can't tell if it is an illussion or not.\n\nEvery Mage starts with a Spell that lets you disbelieve said Creatures, which in case it is an illusion, will simply have it poof into thin air and gain another chance to cast a spell.\n\nIf you guess wrong though, the cast for this round is over and you are left in disadvantage.

So if you use holy themed cards, you have a higher % chance to cast those types of cards.\n\nWhy's that important?\n\nYou can cast any type of card using an ability called Illusion. That has 100% chance to cast the card. But let's say you notice your opponent casting a lot of Holy-ish cards and then then cast a high-level demon card. Chances are almost guaranteed that they used the Illusion ability.\n\nYou have an ability to dispell illusions, and if you guess correctly that it is an illusion, you get to cast another spell and they basically wasted their turn.  The kicker to that is, if you guess wrong they get to keep the strong minion and you lose a turn.\n\nThere's more to the game than that, but knowing that will get you started until you figure the rest out. Also, the higher % you see on your enemies when you attack them, the more likely you are to hit them with an attack and kill them. Pretty easy, but like I said, there's more to it than that, and that's where the game gets fun.\n\nExamples: As with any turn based game, different units have different strengths. Some can move more spaces, some can fly over obtacles, some hit harder, some get stronger when they kill opponents, etc. And that's not even getting into staff abilities, mana and other stuff. But you can figure that out while you play.","July 8, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

You start as a wizard each and as the turns move on you'll be casting creatures, and spells from the cards drawn from your deck, while racing to mana wells to power up your abilities.\n\nCertainly it features a lot of tactical thinking and great for those who enjoy cerebral gameplay. The game currently looks quite good as well, with a fantasy setting that could rival Blizzard design. Though the gameplay is quite enjoyable already do know it's not perfect and there are serious missing elements to this game currently.\n\nAlmost all character customization and a large part of the progression system has yet to be implmented (as of this impression) and the gameplay focus almost soley on RNG based tactics.\n\nCurrently I can say the gameplay is enjoyable, but lacks any sense of commitment since the progression system is simply not there. The game's core is playable currently but do know a very large portion of this game has yet to be implemented. It feels very incomplete right now.\n\nI will give this game a recommendation solely because steam dosn't allow for mixed reviews, but do know you are getting the bare minimum currently. I'd recommend keeping an eye on Chaos reborn for the time being and invest in it on later versions or even when the game is complete\n\nPros:\n- Good visuals and audio\n- Engaging tactical play\n- From a proven and competent development team\n\nCons:\n- Feels very early and incomplete.

The game is turn based on a hex board, beginning with two wizards. Turns are spent vying for position and building strength, with the ultimate goal of taking down the rival wizard. However, not only do the individual spells have certain probabilities of success, but the casting of spells alters these probabilities. The result is a very deep and satisfying experience (even when a string of bad luck will inspire a decidedly... emotional investment in the game).\n\nWhat's best is that the game gently eases the player into the complexity through a series of tutorials with optional challenges (recommended both for the challenge and a deeper understanding), which is rare to find even in simpler titles. Rounding out the package is a very attractive look, with a full 360 degree view of the battlefield and the ability to zoom in to see the great artwork on display.\n\nEven so early on, I give this game my highest possible recommendation to anyone with even a remote interest in turn based strategy.","December 30, 2015","true","36.8"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

As of now it definitely feels like a huge part of the game and what most people would spend time in; even competitive players not interested in realms would likely play here for the rewards. Nothing as large and complex as endless legend games though\n\n=====Negatives:\n\n-Portals cost gold and are often the only way to reach different areas, which can slow progress down or leave people stuck\n\n-Fee for joining realms in certain cases such as after abandoning the realm: if someone gets stuck and they are forced to abandon the realm or wait for a long time for a random volunteer match, they are further punished by this... abandoning forfeits all rewards aside from xp anyway, don't think we need this\n\n-Equipment doesn't tell you exactly what they do, for example does a "creature" staff give you different cards from a different type of staff? Which cards specifically?\n\n-There seems to be no way to truly customise your deck to what you like if you can only choose from "types", especially when you don't know exactly what's different about them apart from the small stuff they do tell you (deck/hand size, etc)\n\n=====Meh stuff (stuff that's not that bad but could be better):\n\n-Might not have enough variety for some people, with only a handful of units spread out over three categories (neutral, law, chaos)... we'll see how much content is added in the future and at what rate, right now it's still serviceable\n\n-RNG CAN be an annoyance, but just like endless legend you can make your RNG better by playing tactically, checking enemy movement and attack ranges, using the terrain and manipulating lines of sight\n\n-There are only a handful of realms as of now and it seems like there are little ways to get more realms... we'll have to see about this in the future\n\n-Volunteer system lets you play in other players' realms, but only for one battle... nice but turn-based realms supporting multiple players would have been better\n\n-fighters from villages can only reach a short distance from where they are based. not a huge problem but there should be some sort of indication as to how far they can reach as this is important when deciding whether you need control of the village or not to help attack an area\n\n-ordering your villages around feels clunky, and the bubbles representing them on the map don't accurately let you know where they are. This becomes important if you're moving around while a marauder's chasing you, as they could be just out of your reach to join the fight\n\n=====ALL IN ALL\n\nthere's a lot of annoyances and stuff that isn't explained well, but the gameplay has fantastic mechanics and plays well. Not something I would would spend a lot of time on per day, but still a good game!\n\n=== if i made any mistakes, message or pm me or something","October 27, 2015","true","7.3"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

The game mechanics work in such a way that you can move, cast, and attack all in a single turn.  Many of your spells are summons that bring in other beasts and baddies to fight for you.  They, too, have their own turn cycle within your turn.  A sub-turn, per summoned creature, if you will.\n\nDepending on the value of the card will determine if you can successfully cast it or not.  The chance of success is clearly shown via a percentage (%) amount on the card itself.  You can increase your chances by investing mana crystals either found on the level itself, signified by the bright glowing plants or by discarding cards.  For 100% chance at casting your spell, you can instead opt to have your summon be an illusion. But you need to be careful, summoning something too powerful early on will be a VERY easy tell that you summoned an illusion and can be easily dispelled.\n\nThe multiplayer portion worked without a hitch and even offers an asynchronous mode, so you can play with friends even if you can't align on a time schedule.\n\nVisually speaking, everything is top-notch.  Exotic deadly plant life, lumbering giants, manticores, everything looks amazing!\n\nReally I'm surprised this game is considered Early Access at all.\n\nKudos to the Dev Team on a stellar Early Access Launch.","December 9, 2014","true","4.9"," 13 of 22 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","13","22","0","0"

Yes RNG has very big influence on gameplay(wizard battles) but on other hand it gives to game all that tension and fun since very beggining of match to very end. Yes it is ennoying to die in match and not able to succesfully cast anything(sometimes happens even but very rarely) but then...Sometimes when you think you have lost and then game change in favour of you after you have made some clever moves to defend yourself and turn it around...There is not better feeling of satisfaction after such game if you win or draw!\n\nGame itself can be played just as wizard battles mode, where you have to kill opponnent wizards.You kill it with summoned creatures or lovely magic bolt just right into his face! Right if you manage to get close enough and if he didn't kill you previous turns :).\nThere are avaiable 1vs1, 3way, 4way, 2vs2. These can be played for fun as friendly matches or as ranked for rank in league. There are two main types of play in battles. You can play classic mode which will be playing with pure randomn spells without any boost or adjustability to your gear/stats/creatures.\nOr you can play Equipped mode. There you can equip gear, staffs and talismans which give a boost to you or your creatures or bind spells you want most to have in deck to be there for battle.\nThere is also singleplayer with lots of realms made by players, where you should defeat king of the realm you entered. You lure in realm search for his lords, battle them and buy equipment(in story mode wizard battles are in Equiped mode) from towns, hire creatures and so on. The best fun of Story mode is that it can be played as multiplayer too!(not if you don't want to). There is option that you can let other players invade your realm and they will take control of king or lords to fight you. Even better is that you can aid other wizards or being aided by them.Like that you together will fight lords and king once you approach actuall battle mode screen! So basicly you can get 1vs1 or 2vs2 in storymode too! Really fun!\nI prefer to play mainly classic mode and story mode and I still have not enough despite of hundreds of battles! There are also tournament sites(link is in game) where you can arrange matches with cool people! Either friendly modes or for monthly tournaments in 1vs1, 3way and even Tournament of Gods!(search for it if you really intrested!).\n\nWho I would recomend this game to?\nIf you are player for turnbase strategies, card player like Magic the gathering, you love a tension(like poker player) in gameplay, you love fun - same time challenge, and great community then this game is for you! If you have friends you can play together this game, is more than recommended as it has multiplayer mode over interent or just on one computer!\n\nWho I would not recomend this game to?\nTo players who doesn't like loosing(specially if you have personality which tends to like under control everything, no offence but RNG can't be controled), because you will loose in this game even if you are very smart. People who doesn't like intensive thinking, doesn't like to risk without clear outcome.\n\nNow brrb gonna do some quick games in classic!","November 8, 2015","true","210.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

All the components of what made the original so compulsively playable are here, right down to the "just one more game before bed" feeling that robbed you of sleep all those years ago. It's just multiplayer now, but i's going to have crazy amounts of content - some MMO stuff here and there, equipable items, areas to rule over and what basically equates to Lords of Chaos, something akin to an adventure mode.\n\nEven though the game is extremely playable and fun there are some balance issues with the newer mechanics and the game is far from done, so you might want to hold off until later unless you want to take part in helping make a stellar game experience just that much better.","December 10, 2014","true","12.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I played it extensively and even eventually got to #1 on the PC Ladder but I was disappointed in the lack of support and polish for the multiplayer, especially regarding balane issues. The multiplayer implementation just left a lot to be desired and was generally left to rot by the devs after very little effort.\n\nChaos Reborn feels like what the X-Com remake's multiplayer SHOULD have been like. There are some minor balance issues that I have no doubt Julian Gollop will take care of (It's in early access now) but other than that the game is amazing and is only going to get better.\n\nI backed this game in Kickstarter and I feel like I'm already happy with my investment even though a lot of the bells and whistles aren't implemented yet.

The random nature of the game might not be to everyone’s taste, but it’s a game of managing the odds and knowing when it’s worth taking a risk that leads to an amazingly addictive game that, at times, will have you winning a game against odds that you didn’t think were possible.\n\nAs a remake, and as it stands at the moment, I have no hesitation recommending it, yet there are a lot of things planned for the future that drastically expand upon the original’s concept.\n\nIf you remember the original game, you need this. If not, give it a go anyway. Even if strategy games aren’t your thing, you might find this one a lot more fun than most.","December 18, 2014","true","118.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm personally waiting for the Chaos Realms mode (Single Player) because, after reading all of the features to come in that mode, it simply sounds like a great rpg element.  Although its still in beta I have NOT experienced any bugs or other issues in offline or online battles.   My only issue with the game thus far is that it typically takes a while (5-10+ minutes, if at all) to locate a multiplayer game with any amount of players but more so for 3 or 4 player games (pretty obvious as the player base doesn't seem too large at the moment).  Hopefully that changes with time as the game advances because, in my opinion, it has great potential.

The combat is great, some balance problems, but fun. The biggest problem in my opinion is the huge amount of rng this game has. It's so easy to lose because a 90% chance spell failed, or because your oponent's 15% chance spell succeeded and wrecked you. To be fair, this is kinda a problem of the genre, and I"m sure some people might enjoy this system.

Check out any list of "best games for xxx computer" and the chances are, one or more of his games will be near the top.\n\nThis, a re-imagining of one of his most fun and accessible games, will satisfy anyone craving a turn-based battle with a few random elements thrown in. Matches are hectic and can flip in a heartbeat, just like the original, and don't last too long so are ideal for the modern gamer.\n\nThe only criticism for me is that, as it stands, it lacks polish (mainly the controls and sound effects need focussing on), but I'm sure this will be addressed once they get the planned core game features brought out.\n\nAnyone with fond memories of the original Speccy version, what are you waiting for?

Gameplay is great and fun to play, the random draws of the spells and easy to learn mechanics of the game mean that If you are new to the game then you will not have a hard time playing against someone who has sunk several hours into the game. Some would say that makes the game unbalanced but I see it as away to let new people to the game be on a fair playing felid with players who have had more time to play. Cards (spells) are unlocked as you level up, maps vary in size depending on how many people are playing. So far you can play 1v1, 1v1v1, 1v1v1v1 & 2v2 online, with a spectator & offline mode also available.\nThe game offers so much fun already, I look forward what awaits in the coming year and for the full release.","December 24, 2014","true","19.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The potential for this game is great. Already the gameplay is fun as can be, but this doesn't mean there is not room for improvement. The matchmaking right now is a little unfair because of the lack of players. For example facing level 20+ players while being a level 8 is not uncommon. But your skill can still give you the uperhand. Another neat feature is the implementation of chance. You get a percentage of success for each spell and attack. Many players think that this makes the game purely luck and no skill, but this is a very wrong notion. The probablily can be frustrating at times, but truly if you play conservatively and take risk every once in a while then you will see this game is truly not flawed.

These underlying mechanics give added importance to bluffing and reasoning out opponents' decisions from a more nuanced angle.\n\nI find the art and sounds to be very well done.  I'm a fan of the more simplistic designs that were part of the Kickstarter's early days, but the added details and embelishments feel very thorough and consistent.\n\nThe inclusion of a Classic mode is great for those who want to do away with all of the fancy character customization and play the game on a more even footing.  That said, I've found the leveling and customizations to be well thought out and balanced.\n\nThe player's guide that's available ingame is excellently presented with accurate descriptions and illustrations.  Same for the readily available info cards.  All of the needed information is placed right up front which really helps make the game accessible to new and old players alike.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game to hop in for a quick brawl, but don't be surprised when you find yourself itching to play just one more game.","October 28, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozemzak/recommended/319050/","kozemzak","Hapless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kozemzak/","107 products in account","UPDATE FOR 1.3/RELEASE VERSION: The official release is finally here (admittedly, I've only recently picked the game back up: I started playing post-release in v1.2 after a hiatus that began at roughly 0.3)! I love that Snapshot decided to incorporate both classic and equipped modes for ranked (and friendly) play into the release version. This exact functionality was on my wishlist when the game was initially released on Steam.\n\nThe Forgemaster (and equipment in general) system is fun and appropriately complex, and I appreciate the foresight evident in the decision to allow for a second "Forging" at level 33.\n\nI can't say that I think much of the single-player (both local and online) elements so far, but these aspects of the game have been provided with some key improvements in 1.3: AI tweaks have been made, an offline campaign is now available, and the ability to grind out a realm while in the queue for a multiplayer match was added.\n\nGollop and his dev team seem entirely dedicated to perfecting an already-great game, and I expect that I'll continue to be pleasantly surprised by future refinements.\n\n---\n\nUPDATE FOR 0.24: My initial take on the combat/spellcasting RNG was flawed, I think. The RNG system is part of what makes this game so fun. Skilled use of illusions/Disbelieve, proper positioning/movement, and careful consideration of combat odds will each go a long way toward becoming "good" at this game. Poker is a comparison that many players have drawn, and it's an apt one. Chaos Reborn is all about taking calculated risks: sometimes they'll pay off splendidly, and sometimes your hydra will die to a rat. Always have a contingency plan, if possible.\n\nThe 0.24 update adds some interesting new spells, and a new staff system. I'm a big fan of the new staff system, as the deck composition + mega spell combos are quite varied - I think this makes for a more balanced game (previously I was of the opinion that the Mega Bolt staffs simply outclassed all others). The new spells are useful and fun. Teleport in particular is a brilliant addition, I think - there are many applications for the spell, and the inability to move, attack, or cast (obviously) after using it makes it about as "fair" as an 8-hex movement boost can be.\n\nAs fun as it is to have an array of new spells at our disposal, I worry slightly that the multiplayer aspect of the game will grow too convoluted for my liking. I really appreciated the straightforward nature of the prior patch's spellset, and I think that a simplistic set of perfectly tuned and balanced spells would really draw players' focus toward the tactical nature of the game - as opposed to spending hours learning about an extremely wide-ranging spellset and arcane, fluid game mechanics. Then again, I generally lean toward a "minimalist" take on most things - my opinion on this matter is certainly influenced by my personal preferences. Besides, if what I'm really wanting out of this game is chess, I should just be playing chess.\n\nIn short: 0.24 is a good patch. I can't wait to see what else Gollop's team has to offer us over the coming months.\n\n---\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW: Very fun, addictive, tactical/RNG-based combat in a high fantasy setting. I'm generally enjoying this game, but the occasional string of bad rolls does cause some frustration. As I understand it, that's part of what makes Chaos, Chaos, though. This could certainly be awesome in the right context - I can see this being a blast to play with friends who are new to the game, or new to tactical combat in general. However, it'd be really nice to have a separate mode for competitive online play: if a player could have at least a small amount of influence over the cards in their "deck", and if the RNG elements were a bit more refined and balanced, I think this would be my dream game.\n\nPersonal opinion aside, this is a lot of game for $20. The combat system is surprisingly deep (despite the seemingly narrow scope of things one can do), and I'm impressed with how polished and functional the interfaces and game world are. Haven't had any issues with bugs, or otherwise. Do yourself a favor and buy this if you enjoy tactical combat, and if you can put up with the rather extreme "chance" element that permeates gameplay. Just be prepared to restrain yourself every time you die to a ranged attack with a <10% chance to hit, an early eagle, or Gooey Blob. Or an opponent successfully casting 2 real dragons just as you're about to win - and proceeding to wreck you with them. Gah.","January 2, 2015","true","128.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has just the right amount of depth and customization which is lacking in similar games (Dogs of War).  So far this could be my favorite turn based game after X-Com (same author of this title).\n\nYou will become highly motivated to complete challenging scenarios in single player as finishing victorious is the only way to keep the weapon/armor upgrades you discover along the way. There are lots of interesting choices for varying playstyles.  You can upgrade your defense and melee skills and charge in or boost your magic power, hang back and sling spells.  Choosing from the large pool of weapon and armor upgrades to streamline your playstyle is definitely one of the strengths of the game.\n\nCriticisms that the game is too random are fairly baseless as there are many tactical and strategic decisions revolving around spell casting order, area control and most importantly equipment loadout. You have several effective and varying ways to boost your spell casting chance and eliminate most rng.  People complaining about rng haven't learned the game mechanics well enough.\n\nThis game is why I game and a no-brainer recommendation for tactical game junkies.","October 30, 2015","true","107.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Nothing wrong with the ability for it to run, it has great visuals, overall I had no problems with its stability.  The issue was the gameplay, now I could have been playing it wrong the entire time but my opinion is that the game is very poorly balanced.\n\nI jumped right into the game and didn't really pay attention to the hero I was creating since I just wanted to play with a friend.  I start off as 'law' so I got this law staff which increases my chance of getting law creatures.  Im telling you right now, law is garbage.  My friend was chaos, so he got to summon a lot of chaos creatures. Chaos creatures have a chance of being undead, which means the only thing that can attack them is the enemy hero or other undead creatures.  I never saw a single law creature that was undead, however you can use offensive spells to kill enemy undead creatures.  Spells are also a problem, casting a spell has a chance to just fail, after the spell cast it has  a chance to not hit enemy creatures.  This does create an issue, I played a game with my friend where I didn't have a single undead creature so I couldn't attack a single one, unless I used my hero.\n\nThis leads to another problem, your hero dies in one hit.  Having a higher attack creature just means it has a higher chance to hit, likewise having a higher defence creature just means it has a higher chance of not being hit.  The weakest creature could kill the strongest creature in one hit, its not likely but the entire game is based on chance.  You have a chance to summon a creature, you have a chance of hitting a creature, you have a chance of not being hit and so on.  To me this throws most strategy out of the window.  All you would have to do to pretty much win everygame is go chaos, summon chaos undead creatures and rush the enemy hero.  Since I went with a law hero I can't change that.  I didn't realize the hero I made WAS MY HERO AND THATS IT.  That could be attributed to my fault for not being more careful but since I made that mistake there is nothing I can do.  There is also an ultimate spell/ability in the game that you could activate for 60 mana.  The mana part is not important what is important is the Laws mega spell.  His mega spell is a sword, which ♥♥♥♥ing sucks.  I was going in for the kill on my friend, I moved my hero and the next turn I would be able to attack him.  When my friends turn was up he spawned in a LAW TYPE CARD which was a regular sword, moved to me, then killed me.  All in one turn he could kill me even though I had the complete and utter advantage.  I heard that your mega spell use to be random, now it is permanant.  So Im stuck with this extremely ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mega spell which has shown to me that it is has been more likely to get me killed.  I can't change any of this, I can't change my deck since law cards are utter ♥♥♥♥ in my opinion.\n\nOverall with the way the game is, the law cards are extremely underpowered, chaos is very OP, and the law mega spell is useless.\n\nEDIT/DISCLAMER:  It has come to attention from some comments that I may have not seen enough/played enough of the game.  I might wait a little or try to get back into it.  Which overall might have me change my review, but it still currently stands as it is.  I have also been told of a paladin card that can attack undead?  However, I never saw the card, so I was unaware there was something that could attack undead.","April 11, 2015","false","3.6"," 20 of 40 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","20","40","0","6"

I'll highlight one of them now:\n\nThere's an illusion mechanic that allows you to cast any card instantly with a 100% success rate, allowing a caster to effectively "bluff" the other castser. Along with illusions, there is another related mechanic called disbelief. Wizards can cast disbelief with a 100% successrate on any creature on the board with the following caveat: If they target an illusion, then they get the chance to cast an additional spell that turn. If the caster guesses wrong, then they've wasted their casting action for the round.\n\nSounds great, right? Except the computer seems to know exactly when and which units are illusions. WTF?\n\nAnd why am I wasting time playing the computer? Well, because it doesn't seem like anyone else is actually playing this game (low population) and because I'd rather not jump into PvP until I've done some preparing.\n\nSo, despite the fact that the game seems to be mainly pvp, I'm playing in the only 2 lobby-based zones for grinding gold to purchase power ups. Sounds like a fun way to get familiar with the game.\nWell, it would have been if I didn't just spend most of my time watching my wizard do nothing.\n\n"Nothing?" you say. "How can that be possible?"\n\nWell I'll tell you.\n\nFirst, most spells have an extremely low casting success rate. Presumably, this was the mechanism the designers use to moderate which cards you can play- cheapy, weak cards early as you build up "shift" and slowly build up the cast percentages of the higher level cards. Too bad that cards with an 80% or better success rate still seem to fail WAY too much.\n\nSecond, once you have a card in play, it becomes a board piece with different stats and qualities. Turns out, the highest attack rate percentage I've seen so far is around 60%. That means rounds go by with both sides just wiffing hard air at one another.\n\nPresumably this gets better as you grind out equipment, but I'm already 4 hours in and I haven't saved any gold... since I have to spend it on garbage like merceneries, traveling expenses and tavern-information in order to play through the PVE zones.\n\nSo far I'm really disappointed.","December 5, 2015","false","6.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","1"

It’s made up of just about every piece I’d ask for from a game like this—mages, strategic turn-based combat, and character customization that allows you to use your imagination to come up with builds that are inventive and interesting. It even has cool features like campaign-based multiplayer—if you’re playing online, you can sign up to be an ally or an invader in other player’s games, a la Dark Souls.\nInstead, I just like it. I play it for an hour or two, having fun most of the way until something happens that makes me close it in varying degrees of annoyance.\nIt’s not because the game is too complicated to be enjoyable—it’s actually pretty intuitive, and if I’m ever unsure, the game’s solid-but-not-amazing UI gets the point across to me without much fuss. Everything about the presentation is good—it runs smoothly, the music is thematically good and unobtrusive. The graphics are nothing fantastic, but I’ve seen much worse in my forays through Steam-released indie games. No, what makes me keep closing the game in anger after two hours of playing it is the same thing they try to market as a selling point in the steam writeup—the RNG that’s baked into the combat system.\nBasically, this game is all-or-nothing, and you don’t always get a say in which way that goes. Every unit dies in one hit, including your wizard. The player (or team) that loses their wizard first loses the game. Things get “stronger” or “weaker” based off of their combat stats, abilities, and board position. This translates into a higher or lower percentage of hitting or getting hit.\nI’m no stranger to RNG. I play Fire Emblem and other games like that where your tactical decisions are based off of mitigating risk. The problem with this game is that just about EVERYTHING is subject to the test of the random number god, and the consequences of a failed roll can be so high that it can quickly dismantle your entire strategy, not just your short-term tactics.\nHere’s one of my many examples so far: One match, I was playing a defensive wizard. I had a heavy armor set on, and I was up against a spellcasting wizard (your typical squishy wizard-type). I drew two Teleports, a sword spell and a ton of expensive monsters that were going to be extremely unreliable to cast. So, I decided to discard a lot of them for mana while using the Teleports to aggressively capture mana sprites that were scattered around the map. My plan was to directly arm my Wizard with a sword and shield and go stab the enemy wizard, since it would be an easy hit for me.\nI played the first five turns like this—so far, so good. I’m in a great field position to walk up and stab the enemy wizard next turn. I have my sword already out, and I’ve collected enough mana to cast my mega spell, (basically, powered-up versions of regular spells). My mega-spell was a really strong shield. I cast it on myself because I know I’m in counterattack range from the wizard’s two puny entry-level goblins, and I take their hit chance so low that they have next to no chance of stopping me (8% chance).\nOn the enemy’s turn, the one of those goblins walks up, swings at me, connects through that 8%, and I lose the match.\nReally?\nA case can be made that I put all my eggs in one basket when I started moving my wizard aggressively, but I’d have to respectfully disagree that that’s the real problem. I spent five turns setting up those circumstances (not to mention picking the staff and armor before the match even started), and I would say that I earned the right to that superior strategic position.\nIn my experience, RNG in strategy games is normally used as a punishment for going against the established rules. If you attack someone who has a better tactical position than you, you should expect for things not to go your way most of the time. But the way this game is set up, it can sometimes feel less like a punishment and more like using dice to play chess.\nWhat bothers me the most is that when the RNG behaves and doesn’t roll ridiculous outliers, the game is really enjoyable, and the progression and joy of finding a cool staff or talisman in a shop and going “man, what kind of builds could I do with this?” will probably keep me coming back for quite a while. I just don’t feel that the high strategic instability this RNG adds to the game enhances it in any way. If instead every unit had 100 HP, and the game used the exact same calculations to calculate damage instead of accuracy, it would be a lot more palatable.\nLong story short, I’m still going to recommend this, with reservations. If you’re one of those people who yells and screams and gets violent when things don’t go your way, you might want to steer clear of this one. But if you’re down to laugh at your own misfortune (or shake your head and go “how did I get so lucky?” when you win unexpectedly), you can have many hours of fun wandering the Chaos Realms.\nMaybe you’ll see me there! But if you gimp me with an 8% hit, I WILL find you.","March 26","true","24.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

No hitpoints means that when an enemy has two real hydras on the field, as in my last game, you can't possibly 'whittle them down' as you would in a more typical game.  Nothing I could spawn had even a 10% chance of hitting them, so they were terrifying.  I only won the last game by slowing the hydras down while I chased after the enemy wizard himself.  I killed him with a goblin - the cheapest chaos unit.\n\nRNG means that you want to play many games, and invest your emotions in a series of games, rather than just one game.  RNG can screw you in one game.  In a series of games, player skill rises above.  Apparently people don't play poker anymore so I'm obliged to say this obvious stuff.\n\nIt's in early access, and has some obvious faults still (why is 'male/female' a dropdown menu instead of a toggle?), but the offline and campaign modes are enjoyable enough to make it worth it for me.  However, and this is why I'm making a review with this few hours in the game: I must warn you that the multiplayer game is dead.  Do not bother waiting for matchmaking, or for a player to invite you into their campaign, or for a player to help you in a campaign.  Until the multiplayer kicks off - check steamcharts - you're best off making friends with other players who have the game, and hitting them up directly for multiplayer.\n\nThis runs great and is pretty on good hardware; on cheap hardware, I'm talking "I usually only play VNs on this machine" hardware, the particle effects in the menu slow things down a bit, but once in game it's comfortable and playable.\n\nEDIT: another way to play!  multiplayer, new game, check everything, select 'asynchronous' game mode.  You'll instantly create an asynchronous game that will find or attract an opponent, and can play it over time.","September 27, 2015","true","21.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xreiettox/recommended/319050/","xreiettox","Carcino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xreiettox/","111 products in account","Chaos Reborn is a fun RNG based strategy game where victory is decided by 80% luck and 20% actual strategy, with that 20% making all the difference. If players of equal experience and knowledge of the game went up against each other, it could literally go either way.\n\nA good portion of a player’s time will most likely be spent on a graphical game board which involves the player liberating a particular realm of magic from a tyrannical wizarding ruler. While these wizards are normally controlled by an AI, an invading player can allow the enemy wizard to be controlled by human player who, on his own, queued up with the opportunity to play against the invader. It should also be noted that if a player simply wishes to go up against the AI without another live player interfering, this is possible by selecting a simple menu option, although additional rewards are attained for defeating a live player.\n\nThe concepts are simple enough to understand, with data on the game board being easy to both locate and identify with. While the tutorial mode is fairly thorough in teaching players the basics, there is a bit of a learning curve in regards to the game mechanics surrounding this invasion mode of gameplay. Different resources and objectives are present without an immediate explanation as to what they are or why they are important, potentially causing new players to feel overwhelmed. Although the invasion mode lacks its own official tutorial, certain realms have been designed solely with the expressed purpose of showing newer players the ropes, but knowing which realms are designed for this purpose is sometimes not entirely clear.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun and fluid, if not sometimes unpredictable. While I will not go into each gameplay mechanic I will summarize some main ones. Each turn you draw a card from a semi-randomized card pool generated by the computer for the specific match you are in currently. (Some items guarantee certain cards to appear in your deck, however there is no actual deck creator). You then use these cards either to summon creatures onto the field to do your bidding, or directly cast spells with the intention of either benefiting yourself or negatively affecting your opponent. You as a player may cast one card (spell) each turn unless otherwise specified. Each and every spell casted by either party has a percentage rate of being casted successfully. If your spells are not casted successfully (failing RNG check) your spell will fizzle, forfeiting your chance of playing a card for that turn. While certain traits can increase or decrease the probability of a spell succeeding, anything is possible involving a game of chance.\n\nAnother thing to note is that there is no HP in this game. If a creature sustains damage, that creature is destroyed. If your wizard is hit by an attack from a creature or by certain spells, you lose the game. Whether or not a spell connects with a given target is based on another RNG check. Just because you succeeded in casting it doesn’t mean it will actually hit its target.\n\nEven though certain aspects of gameplay are not quite as transparent as I feel they should be, anyone who has played similar games should be able to pick up Chaos Reborn and have a decent grasp on it within a reasonable timeframe. At $20 regular price, the game is worth a purchase even if it isn't on sale if you are a fan on the genre.\n\n","December 5, 2015","true","31.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

All the elements for a great strategy RPG are there, but somehow, they just don't all fit together very well...Everything feels really unbalanced. The alignment system is interesting, but feels rather clunky. The special staff spells seem laughably underpowered.  And worst of all for an S-RPG, dumb luck, rather than skill or strategy, seem to dominate game play. If you're thinking of purchasing this game, well, I'm not saying not to, but I would definitely wait until it's out of EA, and then spring for it if you're still interested.

And it does incoporate those elements, at least on the surface level. But what Chaos Reborn actually *is*, at its core, is a game of RNG mitigation, not unlike blackjack or roulette. If you don't care for games of chance and risk, i.e. gambling, then you probably won't care for this game.\n\nThe game's description blurb does include this caveat: "Superb RNG management skills required! Or just have fun." But how can you have fun if you don't have a knack *and* a liking for hardcore RNG management? (Or, as I see it, RNG mitigation.)\n\nHonestly, the given fact that the designer of Chaos Reborn was a designer of XCOM shouldn't be a consideration when deciding whether or not to purchase. Because, really, Chaos Reborn is only superficially like XCOM. (Oh, and it's only superficially like Magic the Gathering, in case you're wondering.)\n\nNote, I'm not saying Chaos Reborn is a *bad* game. I'm just saying it's not really what it appears to be on its surface; and I, for one, didn't like what it turned out to actually be. Thus, I personally cannot recommend it.","March 4","false","8.1"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gandolan/recommended/319050/","Gandolan","Gandolan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gandolan/","46 products in account","Chaos Reborn is an awesome round-based strategic card game with magic creatures summoned by wizards.\nYou fight yourself through many enemy wizards to stop a powerful mage who is preparing a spell to banish you out of this world. On your way you will sometimes encounter story parts where you have to choose your decision, ending in different effects. Also you can find and buy new equipment for your wizard or recruit creatures to help you on your journey. It's a war against time, if you are not fast enough, you will get booted out!\n\nWhile fighting you use random cards you can summon in two ways:\n\nReal - There will be a success rate for your summoning. The normal way to bring a creature to life.\n\nIllusion - To trick your enemy you can summon your creature with a 100% success rate as an illusion. This will look for the enemy wizard like every other creature on the battlefield. But if your enemy doesn't trust your recent summoning, he is able to cast "Disbelieve", if he cast it on your illusion it will vanish instantly. If he is wrong and your creature was real, he will not be able to cast another spell this turn, if he is right, he can cast "Disbelieve" again. Your illusions can fight like every normal creature on the map.\n\nThere are 3 types of monsters: Law, Neutral and Chaos. Every monster has his own special abilites like flying, paralyze and more. While casting law or chaos summonings you will push the battlefield percentage a little bit more in this direction, causing summonings to have a higher success rate while its side is in favour / lower success rate while the world is in its disadvantage.\n\nThe bottom line is that you have a lot of strategic options while fighting: Illusions, abilities and more, making the game a solid strategy and fantasy game. You can also join up with your friends, playing in multiplayer / co-op mode.\nBut the point why I can't recommend this game is the extreme focus on luck via impacting success rates (not only summonings - there are also rates on attacks, giving luck a very important role), destroying every strategy part. You will very often fail (even with 90%) only because of these success rates and not be able to summon anything will determine your fate in many situations. This is turning this game in a very luck based game, leaving strategy behind. Yeah, it's right. Luck is part of life, but it never should take over, it will just kill the gameplay and fun.","June 5","false","11.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

The new game is basically a rewrite of this classic with better graphics but only supports 4 wizards.\n\nI later played Lords of Chaos which was great, the invisible pixies which you could give magic weapons to was genius.\n\nI also completed Magic and Mayhem which was another classic, loved the way you had to use runes in different combos to decide which spells you had in the game; my favorite level was the one where you had to spread disease amongst the numerous pixies to win the level.\n\nThese 3 previous games were brilliant, so I thought that this latest installment would also be great.\n\nUnfortunately I'm left feeling the same way I recently felt after watching the latest starwars movie, a bit bored and fed the same stuff I had already experienced before!!!\n\nChaos reborn is not a bad game, its just a rehash with no new interesting gameplay, the gooey blobs are a bit crap compared to the original as well.\nWell that's the online pvp bit, the realm bit is just dull and the pay extra to unlock the 'forge' AFTER I HAVE ALREADY PURCHASED THE GAME is just rude imho.\n\nIt needs pixies/invisible stuff and some sort of rune manipulation like its ancestor, or some sort of new game mechanic.\n\nIts also missing many of the units from the original, namely fauns, centaurs, bears, king cobras, zombies, griffins, spectres and the 3 dragons, red, green, golden, oh and no fire spell!!!\n\nBut it does have some new units: paladins, hellhounds, elephants and a new dragon.\n\nI think some more troop types would make it better.\n\nAm on the fence right now as its a bit of a disapointment on one hand but refreshing compared to some of the dross out there on the other, might be a grower, so will give it the benefit of the doubt.","January 3","true","31.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Yes.\nIf you fail said diceroll in the first and at times second turn, you instantly lose.\n- ALL UNITS, including your Wizard only have 1 Health, meaning 1 hit will kill them, no matter what*\n* Yes, this means a tiny Rat can kill a big ♥♥♥♥ing Dragon.\n- Some map tilesets are stupid as ♥♥♥♥*\n* I've often come across a map tilset, where there were platform OUTSIDE the original "arena", making the guy I was against capable in dragging the game out until a draw. That's just absurd in every single way. (No, the game only gave me 1 flying and 2 ranged units that game, which died early in the game)\n- RNG on what cards are in your deck\n- RNG on summoning creatures (20-70% fail rates)\n- RNG on attacking (50-70% fail rates)\n\n- FAKE DIFFICULTY in Realm Battles:\nBasically Realm Battle is somewhat like Heroes of Might and Magic, just worse in every single way.\nYou play against the AI, but also against others in hope to beat their scores when you complete the Realm.\n\nThe AI will typically have Mercenaries on its side, you can get them aswell. The AI however likes to cheat by having way more than you can get, making the final fight a boring diceroll-fest of worshipping RNG until it goes your way (which often seems to be rigged to favor the AI) - Sure you can just search for an Ally, but then you need to use an Ally token, which is granted by volunteering for either an Ally or Invader, which can take a while before happening.\n\n------------\n\nAs an example to why I'd never suggest my friends to play this game:\nI've had 5 encounters in row where I failed ALL of my summons with over 80% success rate, that's just absurd.\nWe literally lost because the diceroll failed, with 80% success rate. There's absolutely 0 skill involved here.\n\nTo those who enjoy all this random shenanigans, please feel free to play the game, I certaintly can't stand games that only favors RNG as its only element.\n\nAll in all..

This is about it. As one might think, this plays out a lot like X-Com, but with prebuilt decks, from which you summon various spells. It feel a little like being the planesmaster in Magic: the Gathering.\n\nThus far, there is no story mode, and games are over in a mere 10-20 turns. While it is not as dynamic as X-Com, the graphics are exceptionally done, and show a fine level of 3D vivacity not apparent in many other gaming releases. In fact, I feel bad putting it in the same sentence as X-Com, despite its humble price tag, and even with the original designer of X-Com onboard. There is not enough mission variety, enemy types, cards, and the battles are far too short. Why am I ranking it up? It is still one of the damned best strategy games this generation.\n\nWhile it may not hold a candle to the original X-Com (in my mind!), it is a solid investment, and more invested toward casual play at its current stage. I would not hesitate to recommend it to its target audience, and even in pre-release, this release stinks of pure goodness and gameplay polish. I'd best just give a scoresheet to keep track.\n\nPros:\n-Everything good that can be said about any tbs game\n-Reeks of polish\n-Good graphics\n\nCons:\n-Only 20 turns\n-Limited decks\n-No deckbuilding\n-Lack of mission variety\n-Short missions\n-Needs more cards\n-Random percentage-based odds of casting spells detracts mildly from strategic input\n\nI suppose some of this can be fixed in DLC. I still feel the new X-Com is a better investment. However, if you're looking for a short stop rather than a long investment, this is a bit more casual. As soon as the single player campaign is finished, I will be eagerly leaping back in to take my shot at it, and a re-review will be in process.\n\nAt present, 8/10.","September 27, 2015","true","1.9"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Depending on your luck the first few times you play it it can be enjoyable or be so rage enducing that you want to delete the game. I have had bad experiences with this game and probability is being downright sadistic. If your luck is terrible dont play this game. I personaly don't like the game very much right now. I don't think a game should rely on luck this much. There is not a lot of skill involved. My opinion on the game may change if the game is improved.\n\nFirst, the positives. The spells are fun and unique, playing against other players is fun (it takes far too long to matchmake though) and when things go your way it is very satisfying.\n\nWhy does everything die in one hit. Its unrealistic. (And before people post comments like "the game is a dystopian fantasy game so of course it wont be realistic" i mean realistic in terms of if this game was real.) How is a "giant" rat supposed to kill a wizard or a dragon in one bite then getting blowtorched by a dragon and surviving. Also the A.I has far better luck than the player. I dont know weather this is just a coincidence but I rarely ever win against A.I as they summon powerful units with a low sucess rate as the real things. You're usually better off fighting players as it is fairer. A HP system needs to be added in so that rediculosly unrealistic things don't happen.\n\nOne of the most frustrating things is failing a cast that you put a lot of mana into to boost its chances or sucessfuly casting a magic attack 3 judgment or the other one (the fillter will probably filter it out if i say its name) and then it doesn't actualy hit any of the targets.\n\nA request to the developers if they see this review. Put in a system that makes it so that if a player fails high sucess chance spells or attacks too much in one battle, give them a tempory buff that stops them from failing these spells for one or two turns. I've only had this game two days playing for a couple of hours each time and I have had more than 10 draws so could the turn limit be longer by defalt.","May 2","false","11.2"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","14","33","0","9"

I was expecting RNG when I bought the game, but I didn't realize the extent of it till I actually played it. If you're expecting to play a classic card / turn base tactical game, DO NOT BUY this game. This game has NOTHING to do with tactics or thinking for that matter.\n\nThe game looks brilliant, the artwork is great, sounds are great, even the menus are great, but the gameplay is rubbish. Any form of thinking, planning or tactics you think you will apply goes down the drain due to the RNG system. Pretty much the RNG negates the entire game, and it's really really strange that the developer went ahead and made the game like this because it's quite obvious a gigantic mistake.\n\nCreature attributes attack and defense, card summoning "chance", hero attack and defense, card random picks, all rendered virtually useless by the RNG system. In over 20 years of playing computer games I haven't ever seen a game that manages to do everything right and then also ruin everything they did right with one bad gameplay design "feature" that is so terribly bad it obliterates everything else.\n\nIt feels really strange, like someone insisted to push this RNG mechanics despite all the harm it does... like someone really stubbornly forced this RNG rubbish based on some kind of ffed up misquided "I'm gonna revolutionize the genre" idea...\n\nReally. DO NOT BUY this game. I know you're thinking something like "it's probably not that bad", I thought the same thing, but I was wrong, don't make the same mistake. Or at least, if you do make the same mistake, make sure you set your clock to 120 minutes before you start playing, so that you can request a steam refund after you're done.","October 31, 2015","false","2.0"," 9 of 23 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","9","23","2","6"

The reliance on RNG is horrificly over used and IMO very lazy design.

Play this if you want to feel helpless and frustrated at the hands of a cruel and whimsical RNGesus.\n\n(The fact that the devs warn you about this in the game's description is a huge tell that they know the game is inherantly flawed IMO)\n\nAddtionally, there's a ton of ill thought out and confusing other mechanics in the game aside from cards. The higher levels of gameplay are filled with a million different meters, pools, exchangers, and so on. Its like jumping into an MMO 15 expansions in, looking at the UI and going "WTF is all this?!". The resulting experience is a chaotic mess and none of it works well together. You can ignore a good half of the meta-deck level mechanics simply because you can't control them enough for them to matter anyway.\n\nHands down the worst card-based strategy game I've ever seen or played.

Unfortunately the gameplay is nowhere near as amazing. The concept of summoning creatures through a percent that sways between order and chaos is definitely a nice touch, however, the game follows the consistent fad that many games are following now through the use of cards as a means of sorting skills and abilities. The game would be amazing, if the ability to actually build a deck how you wanted was an option. However I only dove a little less than 2 hours into the game, before I realized how much I really disliked it. The battle design for the game is very upsetting. There is no consistent way to fight the creatures you summon. In Chaos Reborn every battle is decided by fate. Creatures have very little chance of actually hitting the enemy, and with no health system, any lucky hit is guaranteed to kill. While you may be capable of amassing a small army of units, they can easily be wiped out through several lucky hits by your enemies, as well as several unlucky misses on your part. I understand the game is in Early Access currently, and I believed it had the potential to be something amazing, but it just doesnt stand up to the other Turn Based Strategy games on the market. It has a cool concept, and based on community output it seems to be doing rather well for most players, but I unfortunately could not dive in. If you're looking for an absolutely beautiful game, this will meet your desires. If you're looking for a fresh outlook on TBS games, you're in the right place. If you're looking for a game with balance, you're just not there yet. Maybe it'll get better later on, but for now, it's sub-par in design to the other games you could be purchasing.","October 23, 2015","false","1.6"," 10 of 26 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","10","26","0","0"

Your spells are cards, so what you have available at any one time is random. The chance to cast a spell is random. Yes, you can mitigate, but that kind of detracts from the game. You want to use your powers to beat up on things, not increase percentages to actually succeed at spellcasting. The law/chaos bar is feels forced and adds nothing to the game. The illusion mechanic is senseless and feels like another tacked-on mechanism to justify the casting success randomness. Finally, of course, you have the combat randomness. Overall, I was disappointed at the way the game's mechanisms were put together.\n\nIn addition, as of this writing Chaos Reborn has no single player campaign. Playing solo involves a generated instance where you grind trash to get to a big bad. There's no story involved at all. Finally, this is a loot grind. It's essentially turn-based Diablo 3, and it doesn't have anywhere near the appeal of that title.\n\nUnless you really like randomness and playing odds, instead of feeling like a powerful sorcerer, I recommend passing on this game.","October 29, 2015","false","1.2"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","3"

Conclusion: luck on start is crucial, with one main character with 1 hp, and when a rat can kill a dragon in one blow with 10% of chance...\n\nyou can create and choose between 3 heroes: 3 magicians chaos, neutral or evil, who does not have so much difference in gameplay(no healer, archer, just 1 magician).\nyour deck spell is random all the time.\n\nso you can not really personalise your deck, heroe... and depend of luck every new start of fight, repetitives, and there is nothing more to play or say...\n\n","December 16, 2015","false","9.5"," 0 of 6 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","6","0","1"

Not just minions, There is destructible terrain cards and spells.\n\nCons:\n-When i first saw the words illusion in the tutorial i thought of secrects from hearthstone, or an invisible trap you lay down. Unfortunately it is not that cool. Every card has a set chance ot be summoned generally the better the card the lower the chance. An illusion gives the card (only if its a minion) a 100% chance of being summoned but the opponent can use a disbelieve card which never runs out and can always be used. You may only use 1 card a turn and when you use the disbelieve if it works your turn goes on. Generally id have no problem with a card like disbelieve being a card but when such large random chance is involved with the game it is a problem. more often than not you will find an opponent who spams illusions. No problem right? Wrong because if the opponent gets 1 lucky roll and summons a real minion suddenly in a game where every turn matters you lose.\n\n-I have a major problem with there P2W gamemode. You can quite literally drop 80$ for the best gear in the game. Now dont get me wrong with 60+ hours of straight grinding im sure you can get this gear. And while it woudnt be a major problem at the higher ranks, if someone in the lower ranks drops 80$ for it they get garunteed victorys (the gear is thta good).\n\n-I for the most part love RNG. It can make an otherwise abyssmal game fun. Binding of Isaac for example, imagine how boring playing the same seed every run would be. But as i said before when you can pay to increase the RNGs favor its not okay. Which this game allows you to do. The illusion and disbelieve aspect aswell as microtransactions for better gear makes this games RNG to somethign truly random and fair to all. For most games pitting a pro against a average player, There would be no competition but in this game if the average player buys gear the pro could just be screwed over by the tilted RNG.\n\n-Microtransactions are annoying to most gamers. i find them annoyign aswell. wlel to be clear i have no problem with cosmetic microtransactions if you want to make sure AK-47 (CS:GO) look cooler go ahead. i admit to have partaken in these before. I love CS:GO and have no problem payign a little money for a case or 2. But i would quit cs:go entirely if they said you know what if you want the AK-47 with a laser sight give me 5 dollars. Which is what this game does you can grind for pack money like in hearthstone which takes approx 2 hours for the best pack available. Or pay X dollars for X Amount of packs.\n\n\n\nBut who knows maybe im just a filthy casual. :steamsalty::steamsalty::steamsalty::steamsalty::steamsalty::steamsalty::steamsalty:","November 4, 2015","false","1.4"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","4"

Anything that is negative to the brand, censor it!\nSo i forsee as in many other games, the hard core gamers with fantasy are joining on old premesises and reputation of the developers, just to see themself fooled, every sane person will see through the mirage of fake gamedevelopment.\n\nThis game has a fake set up Random number generator that implements diminishing results after flagged events.\nIn the early versions it was very prone to show itself as streaks of 10+ bad occurances in the RNG rolling.\nLater versions had a more tweaked set up RNG interface that allowed matches to go on just to make them look and feal like they where a struggle and improve the fun factor.\nIn the version where equippment was introduced the set up RNG motor works in harmony with the equipped items and level of the charatcher, making lower level players have no chanse to beat higher level players.\n\nSo why make a stragtegic real time simulator and give the opportunity to equipp your wisard so any other player withoute hundreds of spent hours got no chanse to win,even if he is twice as good.\nThe result is a game where actual wits, strategy or skill has no or little value.\nThis game is a joke compared to its old predesessors.\nI recomend playing these games instead\nLORDS OF CHAOS\nLASER SQUAD\n\nGiven the fact that this game is money driven you can assume the final product is going to implement everything a modern game has to offer, amking you a brainless player chasing those coins, items and fame.\nThere is as much skill in this game as cady crush or any other game implementing the hedonic treadmill.\n\nYou want to spend hundreds of hundreds of hours trying to get those good items, if you are not in the right guild ruled by an bullying poweradmin you cant get those good items. The guilds will decide who gets the good stuff with the help of random item rolls, Sound interesting?\nWell not for a strategy orientated gamer who loves fair play and the combat between two minds at its best.\n\nThis game is not recomended, it has a cheating fake under the desk RNG, mixed with bad equippment rules, bad multiplayer rules and a bad developer team.\n\nSpent hundreds of hours playing this game, beaten the community leaders in game just to get banned in the forum afterwards.

Still far from being completed. As more gameplay elements and game modes are introduced, the quality of playing experience varies from build to build. Current version, for example, temporarily has only  "RPG mode" available, where more experienced players not only have a significant skill advantage, but also better stats, equipment and abilities. I believe the developers will reintroduce "classic mode" soon.\nFew words about the core gameplay. You control a wizard in a turn-based battle agains 1-3 opponents. 2 vs 2 mode is also available. You can move on 2d hex grid and cast spells drawn from limited semi-random deck. There are no hit-points, atk/def stats only affect the probability of succesful hit that kills instantly. While you can attack your enemies directly, most of the time you use magical creatures to fight for you, with help of some support spells and structures including ones that block enemy's movement, resurrect you or your units or give you additional spells. There are many more mechanics, such as law/order balance, mana to boost spells, using height difference, bluffing via creating illusions instead of "real" creatures, selecting equipment and talismans that add various buffs and extra abilities.","December 26, 2014","true","177.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for people who had no idea what chaos reborn is and are jumping right into in, not unlike myself, I suggest you take another quick look.\n\nChaos reborn is a game I could only compare to chess on the surface but with alot more depth. There is no grand landscape or fortress to build, just random cards you can use to your advantage. At most, you will only get about 20 - 30 minutes per match if the other players do thier stuff right.\n\nThe AI provides a decent challenge, but players make mistakes, and that is where part of the fun in this game is.\n\nIf you are looking for a Civ 5 game or Magic the Gathering.... the back button is to the top right. If you are looking for a way to play the odds in your favor against other players, have a go at it.

Both modes handle very similarly, with Equipped mode allowing usage of talismans that you acquire by earning gold. I'll explain more about that in a moment. Anywhere from 2 to 4 Players take turns to cast spells (such as summoning Allies in the form of Elves, Dwarfs, Skeletons etc., or blasting foes away with Magic Bolt) and attack. In addition, everything is based of chance, so there are no health bars to keep track of (although I prefer health bars myself) e.g. it is entirely possible to have a dwarf defeat a dragon, even if the chance to succeed was only 9%. Some people will find this hard to handle.\n\nAesthetics\nChaos Reborn does a good job handling the graphics on all levels. Based of the Unity Engine does have some limitations, but everything has a nice consistent art style and the detail is consistent. One of my main gripes with my prior Robocraft review was that Robocraft's graphics worked against itself. With Chaos Reborn, I can't complain.\n\nSoundtrack\nI haven't listened to it much, but the sounds are as good as the graphics - consistent and making sense.\n\nCommunity\nIn the time it took for me to write this review, I had been waiting on a single League game to arrive - and yeah, I never actually got into a game. I would like for the developer to at least let us know how many people were on what gamemode, just so that people can find other people to play against. Unfortunately, outside of playing public matches and connecting to a central server, there literally is NO OTHER WAY to earn gold to buy new talismans and upgrade equipment. Apparently the upcoming Realms is going to introduce a better way of earning gold, but I am skeptical. Oh sure, you can play offline against others in a Hotseat match with bots, but you won't earn gold that way. Even if you could, you would have to still connect to the central server, so hmm.\n\nConclusion\nGood game, but lacking good ways to keep me interested in playing online with others - especially when no others are on, which the game won't tell you about.\n\nAlso, in the time I wrote this Review, I never got into a game of Chaos Reborn to earn said gold.","June 6, 2015","true","73.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Thats how Chaos Reborn seems at first, however after playing for long enouigh any fan of turn based strategy will find there's plenty to do, and that the game shows AMAZING promise. Personally I am a Wizards King backer, anxiously awaiting the release of new features. Within a few days of this review Single player/ offline mode was released, adding to what players can do, so definitely check it out. The price will neither be going upo or down between early access and release so I'd say go and grab it now!","December 23, 2014","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But for people who had no idea what chaos reborn is and are jumping right into in, not unlike myself, I suggest you take another quick look.\n\nChaos reborn is a game I could only compare to chess on the surface but with alot more depth. There is no grand landscape or fortress to build, just random cards you can use to your advantage. At most, you will only get about 20 - 30 minutes per match if the other players do thier stuff right.\n\nThe AI provides a decent challenge, but players make mistakes, and that is where part of the fun in this game is.\n\nIf you are looking for a Civ 5 game or Magic the Gathering.... the back button is to the top right. If you are looking for a way to play the odds in your favor against other players, have a go at it. It wasn't quite my cup of tea, but it might be yours.","July 9, 2015","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
