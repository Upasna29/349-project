It's billed as a HD version of the original. It's not. It's a copy of the original, but not a totally faithful copy. The feel is fairly different, including but not limited to:\nIn the original you were limited to 8 directions for throwing the ball. Speedball 2 HD has some kind of auto-aiming which I think is worse because it is requires less skill.Substitutes never seem to run out (you had 2 in the original and after that you had less players)The AI is worse - it practically ignores the scoring multiplier and the stars (AI is a lost art form in modern gaming)There are other things that can be annoying. Player auto selection can be infuriating and unpredictable. It is also buggy - sometimes the highlighted player isn't the one that moves - and not as responsive as the original. Then there's the bugs with achievements and cups (hint: never exit the game immediately after winning the league or champion's league) and the fact this game feels more like a grind to get the best players than the original where I felt a bit of skill could work against far superior teams.\n\nIt's OK. It's not a classic like the original. Despite being a very similar game with HD graphics, it seems to be missing the soul of the original game and they've made changes based on making the game easier when easier isn't always better. If there were a bugfix release with a few improvements, I'd change the recommendation to a Yes. It's just too flawed for the moment.","November 19, 2014","false","12.7"," 87 of 95 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","87","95","0","0"

It will ruin your memories.\n\nThis is a terrible "HD" remake of the game. It is actually lacking in some features the original had, like the manager mode. What it also is lacking is any difficulty at all, you will easily steamroll every team in the first two seasons, except when you suddenly play a team that is completely maxed out when you still have very low stats.\n\nWhat this game also lacks is any decent graphics. Sure, they are "HD", even though you only get to choose from 4 basic resolutions. Sorry laptop users. But they look terrible. Bitmap Brothers games were known for their slick, stylish graphics and this game almost seems to make a mockery out of that. To add insult to injury the game is locked at 29 FPS, making it difficult for me to play for any length of time due to eye-strain (as if the graphics weren't insulting my eyes enough already).\n\nThen finally you would probably expect an HD remake to have online multiplayer. Nope... Sorry guys. All this remake offers over the original is the higher resolution/horrible design graphics. That's it. No Manager mode, no online multiplayer, no challenge, no point in buying this. Oh did I mention the game crashing, save file corruption, playing teams with identical outfits to yours making it impossible to tell them apart (and then crashing after the match), terrible intro "video", lack of the awesome original soundtrack...\n\nI could go on but this should really be enough for you to make your mind up.

This is a missed opportunity.\n\nIt's the laziest port I could possibly imagine. The original parts of the port - the new character models and the stadium graphics are the kind of quality you would expect to see from work experience placements, not a decent studio. There has been no attempt whatsoever to update the game with modern effects, playstyles or really much of anything over the original game save a couple of powerups.\n\nSo it's not a new or expanded game; it's a faithful conversion of the original, right?\n\nWell, no. It's not a very faithful or interesting remake either. The parts retained from the old amiga game appear to be a few faces and still shots (like the winning/losing graphics and the team portraits) which have either been resized and given the blur treatment, or traced very horribly. Worse, these scaled up and blurred originals contrast garishly with the new player graphics and other elements, making the whole thing seem like a poorly stitched-together hack job.\n\nThe gameplay is at least loosely faithful to the original, meaning that the players are feel hard to control at first (a fair complaint to level at the original and one that sadly hasn't been improved), but they've actually managed to make the original - which gets better with practice - worse, in that it feels very floaty and unpredictable off of the ball, and simple things like catches that would at least act consistently in the 'miggy version are almost impossible to pull off as the timing on performing a catch and/or a slide seems way off.\n\nI would've hoped - since they were departing from a flat conversion by so much - they would've taken the extra mile and applied more interesting effects on the player field, and actually made a smoother analog-friendly movement and control scheme (GASP! Seperate out catch, throw and tackle buttons! Put aftertouch on the triggers or bumpers! ZOUNDS!) to actually play to the strengths of this PC platform rather than bringing all the problems of having to cater to a userbase mostly having one button joysticks.\n\nEh, too much work it seems.\n\nSo... Graphics? Miss. Gameplay? Miss. Sounds? Well, they nicked a bunch of the original ones but chucked some other stock effects in there so I'm going with miss. The gym interface is slightly better I guess. Hard to screw that up with a mouse you would think.\n\nDon't bother. Play the original on an emulator instead. You'll get a more consistent and coherent experience, and if you take a moment to scale the emulator surface at least everything will look equally stretched and blurred.","August 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 25 of 30 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","25","30","0","0"

Never getting tired of the bone crunching tackles or the "Ice cream" yells. Always coming so close to winning the league and then getting stomped on by that one team.

The new teams are brutal at first but they are beatable. It's also nice to be able to play in new arenas but somehow I can't help but be drawn back to those original steel coloured floors.\n\nThey left out some stuff from the first one if memory serves, like you could bribe a match offical to give you more time on the pitch. I'm kind of sad they replaced some of the artwork too.\n\nSadly the people who made this game are no longer around. To the Bitmap Brothers.

After playing through the tutorial (which is hidden in the options menu, by the way), I got the jist of the scoring system. While constantly trying to put my newfound training to use, I quickly realized that running diagonaly makes the player or AI carrying the ball virtually invincible to most tackles. The AI on the player side seems to know nothing about offense or defense and bumbleclucks its way around the arena while the AI throws the ball at bumpers, stars, and somehow teleports the ball around the arena at unpredictable intervals. (And at one time, right into my goal. Hooray for cheating!)\n\nThe power-ups system is nice, except for the part where it's practically useless. I can run faster... Until I get sacked 2 seconds later by a tackle spanning about 10 feet. There also seems to be a complete lack explanation as to what in the apple sauce they do. A purple negative sign? Armor on the ground? A can of... Something with an S on it?\n\nThis game had a lot of promise - and I'm sure 23 or so years ago the original was fantastic - but this one isn't.","January 14, 2015","false","1.0"," 26 of 36 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","26","36","0","0"

It's higher resolution, sure, but all nuance of the original is lost, sprites look comical, pitches ugly and it's even hard to tell where the goalmouth starts and ends. Instead of starting with a team that looks like a bunch of nerds your starting team are now randomly cybernetically enhanced. All 'New Art' motivation for purchasing star players is lost. All players are now a mish-mash of badly redrawn features from original characters. If you enjoy looking at clunky photo-fit faces with glued-on moustaches and noses that line up with mouths perhaps one in ten times (once you see this you can't unsee it), you're in for a real treat.\n\nGraphics aside, the game is still fairly solid. The on-pitch gameplay is basically just a port of the original with no attempts made to revamp. Game mode differs in a few respects, some good, some bad, but nothing is going to make up for the god awful look of the thing.\nIf there was an option to use original graphics I'd probably be able to recommend this. As-is it's really just a curio for fervent fans of the original.

Lets go back to yonder days when I was much much younger than I am now, the mid 90s (Speedball came out in 1988 and 1990 (2) but was re-released for 95/98 in a multipack) and I remember spending many an hour running around with my cyberpunk steroidal war bears beating up the enemy for ball possession and winning the majority of my games purely by knocking out enemy team members (which gives you as many points as scoring a goal might I add) and screaming at my goal keeper to stop being a poof. Ahhh, good times.\n\nFast forward to today and Speedball 2 HD is a re-release of the 1988 cult classic set in the future of a bloodbowl sport which is a combination of lacrosse, american football and cage fighting. It's exactly like the original (as far as I can remember) and I have already spent a few hours knocking out the enemy and scoring obscene goals. It's such a good remake it has all of it's warts and boils with the buggy player swapping whenever the ball is perfectly between three of your players causing it to bounce all over the place. But all that is forgotten when you get your players hip dancing and kneesliding from scoring or knocking out the enemy players.\n\nBrutality aside, this is classic game that is challenging, requires a little thought on how you move around and a lot of keyboards from smashing the spacebar. The challenging enemy players can range from "screwdrivers in their heads" stupid to "holy hell I haven't even touched the ball and it's already half time".

If you have never played the Sega Genesis version, then you will love this game, but for those that loved the genesis version, you will most likely not care for this game.\n\nOverall, Speedball 2 HD is fun. It's a mix between rugby and handball, with a science fiction futuristic twist. There are powerups, warp tunnels, and action items, along with hard hitting, good passing, and goal scoring. The objective of this game is to outscore you opponent. You can score by knocking out a player, hitting stars on the sideboard, hitting 1 of 2 circle orbs in the center of the arena, or get it in the opponent's goal. Each scoring method has its own point value, and the strategy is to score points as quickly and often as possible. The game is action packed, and very fun.\n\nMy main gripe is the differences between the classic Sega version, and this one. While the Steam version has better graphics, more features, better stats, and achievements, the Sega version just dominated it in gameplay. Sega's version was really fast (most likely due to Sega's blast processing ability lol)! The camera view was more zoomed in, so it appeared to move quickly. Throws were longer, there was less hitting and more agility needed, players didn't always fall down in one hit, and there were more stressful and exciting situations that made you grab your controller tightly. Most games were usually close, with scores only 10-20 points different from each other. In the Steam version, I can easily beat the computer by over 100 points in a game. I usually score 40-70 points in 45 seconds, and once that happens, I know they aren't going to come back.\n\nPersonally, I feel that the original price is much too high for this game, but if you can grab it on sale, it's fun for anyone, Speedball fan or not.","March 25, 2014","true","13.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A couple of days later a friend of mine had bought it and told me that it had some niggles that meant it wasn't as good as the Amiga version, but still a good game. Since it's only £5.50 (i'd payed £25 for the Amiga original in 1991!) i figured what the hell, i'll give it a go.\n\nI have to say he was right, it does have some niggles that mean it's not as good as the original Amiga version, but it is still a good game and very enjoyable. Fans of the original will be pleased to hear it plays near identically, with the transfer market, gym and the all important match play itself all faithfully reproduced. Graphically i don't think it compares to the Amiga version though and while many of the sounds have been ported over from the original, some additional sound in the form of in-game music feels out of place. Thankfully said music can be turned off.\n\nIn the match play, the ball feels rather heavy and slow, so doesn't travel very far when thrown. But where the match play compares particularly unfavourably to the Amiga original is with injuries. In the original these were somewhat rare, as even the weakest players were still somewhat strong, but here you will find injuries to opposing players are rather easy to dish out and you'll average at least 3 per game. If you get more, they can't bring on a substitute and so with one or more players short they become a bit too easy to beat. That's not to say the computer teams are a walkover, they certainly aren't, and once they have a sniff of a goal they've as good as scored. So the computer is at least competative, which is a good thing since multiplayer consists of LAN play only, there is no online multiplayer at all. Hopefully this will be addressed in the future as this game is just crying out for that feature.\n\nMy final niggle is the resolution, with 1920x1200 being the maximum supported, so if you playing at a resolution higher than that (as i am) you'll have to make do. With 1920x1080 and 1920x1200 now being pretty much mainstream resolutions for gamers, this game really should support at least up to 2560x1600.\n\nHowever, those are the only issues i've encountered with this game.

Second of all, it looks very nice and is overall polished, stable and well presented. It's kinda nice and might even hold you for a while with it's action, fast loading times and menus and some wit and humour here and there, but rest assured that whatever this game does halfway well, Mutant League Football did miles better back in the old console days.\n\nWhy so bad? Because you control your team in a way where you move one player and the AI "controls" the others before changing the player under your control and moving the player you used to control somewhere less usefull. The AI for the opponent's team does a decent job, much much better than yours so i really don't understand why my defenders are sulking in the corners, midfielders trying to tell their ♥♥♥ from their elbow from lying face down while the attackers are usually urinating in the opposition's corners of the field. Occasionally one of them is thrown under my command but given their position and relative uselessnes in pretty much any situation, i think it would be better if i stopped playing and gave full control to the AI.\n\nThe three attacking players can sorta tackle/pass the ball while rushing forward after the initial face off, but after a few seconds  good luck telling what's going on. It doesn't even matter if you're winning by a 100 spread or losing, your control over your team is equally puzzleing.\n\nAI teams are coompetent enough, they try to tackle, score goals or hit bouncers or whatever else to score points. They look coordinated. You can beat weaker opponents by tackling the crap out of their players and occasionally outsmarting the goalie in the rare cases you go 1-1 on him, but if you ever score off a passing play it will be a fluke. Most matches are a cluster♥♥♥♥ of mashing the single control button (yes, one button passes, shoots, tackles) and having no idea if your attacker will pass or try to strike the ball into the goal.\n\nSometimes the ball teleports randomly to a player on the opposing team if you or the opponent fumble the ball and it rolls to a lonely stop all alone and unloved and unkicked for too long. Your idiots will NEVER be in a position to take advantage while the opponent AI will usually score a goal within seconds.\n\nAnd why the hell do i have to control the goalie?! If i'm trying to chase down a runaway opponent the last thing i want is for the control to be switched to the goalie! Because i'm human and it takes me a moment to realise that control has changed and during that time i'll end up telling the wrong player to move. For example the goalie will dive left and leave the goal unprotected when what i wanted was for a defending player to dive left and tackle!\n\nWhy are you even reading a review for this game? Why does it even exist?? The 90s "classic" was better than this, yes it actually was better despite the bar being much much lower back then and expectations and standards being lower as well. Speedball 2 HD couldn't even beat an average game from the 90s, that's how uninspired, uninteresting and completely ♥♥♥♥ it is.\n\nPlay Mutant League Football, or one of the Sensible Soccer series or Kickoff. All those games only let you control one player on the team with AI controlling the rest and switching occuring at sometimes awkward times. But they were fun and controls worked perfectly (they haven't aged well though). Beat your head into goo with an Atari ST 520 or a frozen cheeze, just don't go near Speedball 2 HD.\n\nDevelopers didn't care enough to keep Manager mode where you at least don't have to play, and they couldn't be bothered to code online multiplayer where two friends could at least laugh and cry together as they fail to control their teams.\n\nThere is nothing to redeem this game. If you were to throw your own poo at the devs windows, it would be a waste of poo.","July 26, 2015","false","3.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lockevincent/recommended/251690/","lockevincent","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lockevincent/","1293 products in account","What the heck is Speedball? No, it’s not a special drug that the kids are doing but it probably has the same effect on your adrenal system. Speedball is a sport designed for cyborgs, played in a not so distant future. Combine football, rugby, and MMA and you have a pretty decent idea of what this brutal sport entails. Matches are quick, taking only a couple minutes, so it isn’t just a clever name. Destroying the other team’s players is just as important as scoring goals and as barbaric as it sounds, Speedball is a surprisingly deep game.\n\nI have always been a sucker for ‘alternative’ sports. Give me Mutant League Hockey over NHL,  Frozen Endzone instead of Madden, and Base Wars before MLB. If I’m going to play a vanilla sport I’m going to do it in real life, reserving futuristic robot sports for the video game medium. Speedball 2 HD is a remake of the Bitmap Brothers’ most successful game, Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe. It’s been over 20 years since the last decent Speedball game and this is the most accurate representation of the sport/game you are going to find. Vivid Games has done the series justice and thank god Mastertronic had the balls to publish the damn thing.\n\nSpeedball is astonishingly simple thanks to a refined control scheme, and two basic rules: The first is to put the biscuit in the basket and the second is to devastate the other team with sick tackles. This is all made very easy by having only one button for all actions, and I highly suggest you have a controller while playing as this will make things much easier. When you have ball possession, pressing the action button will throw the ball in that direction and holding the action button will lob the ball in the air. Pressing the action button without the ball initiates a tackle and your player will slide in the direction he is facing, mauling any opposing player in the way. I’m going to level with you, this ain’t no graceful ballet and Speedball games can quickly devolve into all out brawls since points are rewarded for injuring players on the other team. Once a player is injured by having all their health depleted, they are carted off by medical bots and replaced by a substitute. It’s not my favorite tactic, but beating the other team down so you have a player advantage is acceptable in Speedball, and a great way to win games.\n\nAside from mashing up the other team and scoring goals, there are a number of variables on the field that can change the game. The permanent structures such as bumpers will not only change the course of the ball, but will award bonus points if a team manages to score after the bumper is hit. Bumpers can be used for both offensive and defensive purposes, conjuring up some interesting plays. If you thought it was fun dunking in NBA Street after launching the ball off the backboard...Speedball 2 HD makes that look like child’s play. Ramps on the sides of the field will accelerate the ball and give a 50 percent bonus to points scored on that run, however this is cancelled when the opponent puts it through the ramp. This makes controlling the sidelines paramount to success as it can effectively half the amount of points you need to score during a game. This is especially important when you’re up against a stronger, faster, better team and you don’t have Michael Jordan or Bill Murray on your roster. Other structures on the field include stars on the side that can be used for extra points, as well as portals that will teleport the ball to the other side of the field. Take note playmaking wizards. Finally, random powerups will be littered across the throughout the game that can temporarily boost a player, or harm the opposing team.\nThere are several modes in Speedball 2 HD including quick play, tournament, and a career mode. Career mode puts you in the role of a GM of a team, which you can name and choose a logo, but that is about it when it comes to customization. As you win games, you get cash that can be used to train your players and increase their stats. I found after a couple seasons my winnings had allowed my team to surpass everyone in the galaxy stat-wise so games became terribly easy and I was blowing out teams by 100 points every game. That being said, the AI isn’t great and Speedball 2 HD is best played on a couch with a friend. Multiplayer is unfortunately limited to local only so you are going to have to convince people to come to your house.\n\nSpeedball 2 HD is a great remake, and as I mentioned previously the best version of the game you are going to find. It’s not bustling with features but it has some depth to it. The career mode will keep you busy enough to get your money’s worth and a decent sense of progression across multiple seasons. No online multiplayer is a shame, but if you can manage to get a group of friends over for a small tournament it will be a great game to have. It’s fast, and easy to learn and a hard hitting little gem that satiate your need for a Murderball game.","December 28, 2013","true","1.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There's some weird circle in the middle you can get 2 points from hitting, and you can get a ton of points from scorring a regular goal. There's some sort ofpower up that the bot used, it knocked out all my players.... my players can't seem to pass a certain part of the feild...

Maybe the original actually was a decent game; I wouldn't know since I've never played it.  This one, though, has issues.  For one thing, each Speedball player has several stats that can be raised to improve their performance, but only two of them are actually explained in the tutorial, and the in-game info sheets shed no further light.  Some stats seem self-explanatory, but others are decidedly not, making this an annoying oversight.  More problematic is the fact that you directly control one of the Speedball players on your team, but the game automatically determines which player you control, and switches you around so frequently that it can seem impossible to keep track of what's happening and where you are, and react quickly enough (sometimes control even switches to a player who's off-screen).  That single gameplay flaw is enough to make this game too frustrating to be worth playing.","January 20, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's the same game, and at the same time it really isn't the same game!\n\nFor any Amiga purists out there, you'll notice that causing injuries to other players is a lot easier on this "HD" version, and the ball isn't quite as quick or fluid in the way that it moves around the screen. To me at least it feels like passing became slow and easy - and the ball certainly doesn't travel as far. Gone are the days where you charged the opposing CF and threw it to your winger with plenty of style and grace.\n\nThe faces of old memorable characters are still there, but a real shame they haven't kept their old names - greats such as the old Jams, Norman, Montez, Cooper... all present, but with stupid names. I'd love to have seen them keep those, or at least make player names editable.\n\nIf you can overlook what some would say are trivial aesthetics, the game is enjoyable, with added features such as scouting your opponents stats  before playing them and suchlike.\n\nAt the Steam sale price of under £2 its an excellent bargain.\n\nNow, if only I can find Bloodwych, Supercars 2 and Sensible Soccer on here... ;)","November 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The overall feel of the game is the same but a few issues prevent it from truly recreating the feeling of the original.\n\nI guess expecting a simple graphical update to the original is a bit much as this is probably more of a modernised version of the game and newcomers to the series may find that this game is a lot of fun (which it is); The game just seems to be lacking the soul that made the original so great.\n\nThe aiming seems to now be somewhat automated whereas before you would have to aim to one of the 8 directions available on the joystick, this does make the game easier for newcomers and I can see why this is the way it is. Player selection seems to be a bit clunky at times, suddenly your control is moved to another player and you'll end up performing actions you didn't intend. The menus are certainly a lot more simplified than the original and it seems as though a lot of the control you have over your squad and their training is lost.\n\nI would say overall this game is definitely easier than the original (Steel Fury used to be a very strong opponent but now you can wipe the floor with them) But it's still got something about it that makes me want to play it, I would still recommend this to people just don't go into it expecting to feel and play just like the original.","January 16, 2015","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sound deisgn here is just awesome.\n\n\nThe game features fast-paced gameplay coupled with violent player-to-player collisions resulting in tons of unique gameplay situations to experience. Gaining points doesn't only consist of goal-scoring, but also knocking out the other team's players (each has health bars tha drain upon being hit). As well as hitting certain pinball-type pedastals and such to gain points, and warp-zone and slides to get the ball out of your zone. Tons of ways to gain the advantage against a team that might score often against you.\n\nI constantly score goals that looked so well-played, I can't help but watching the slow-motion replays that play right after your players celebrate.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nYou have the ability to customize your players, scout to trade for new talent, or go to the gym and train your current team if you're pleased with your current setup. Also, before each game with an opponent you have the choice to compare teams with them to see how you might fare. You can compare your team's defense, midfielders, and forward attackers to your opponent.\n\nGenerally, most players will just into career mode and create their own team (choosing a base team's logo, but creating a new name for your team) which is very fun to do, and feels very engaging and interactive in between games.\n\nThe game features a career mode spanning 10 seasons (I believe) so it makes for a lot of fun trying to win championship cups throughout your career. This game makes you feel like both the brutal, violent players, and the aggressive yet witty coach, managing your team as you go, making trades, and training current players. You can even make certain players swap position if they have stats suited more toward defending than attacking.\n\nOVERALL RATING OUT OF 10:\n9/10\nOverall probably the best of the "violent future sport" games ever created.\nIf you've played and enjoyed games such as Cyberball, Smash TV, Gauntlet and American Gladiators for NES, this is far better, albeit totally different in gameplay.\n\n\nICE CREAM!!","December 31, 2014","true","10.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I may be one of the few old fans that are actually happy with this release and am still having a lot of fun with it. This release is not without it's bugs though and there are a few features missing that would have really made this game a big hit with the old fans and the new blood alike.\n\nPositives. The old core game is still there, the fast paced violence, the chaos, the crunching of bone and shoulderpad...just wonderful! The graphics, despite what a lot of detractors say, are quite nice (funtional at worst) and I like a lot of the new team skins and different stadiums. Sometimes the original could get a bit confusing and I think this is a far easier entry point for new players. The game also replicates the Amiga 500's floppy disc drive while loading up matches, I almost spat out my beer when I heard it and I am so glad they put it in.\n\nNegatives. There is no Manager Mode and there is no online Multiplayer. Online play i can forgive to an extent, i would prefer to play in the same room as the guy i am absolutely destyroying but that just isn't possible today. None of my friends can be bothered to play it so online play would have been a bloody godsend. I'm not sure if it was too much hassle, if there were time constraints or if it was a dev/publisher decision, but the community has been fairly vocal about it and i don't think anymore needs to be said. Manager Mode on the other hand, sometimes I just wanna chill and manage my players and watch two teams kick the crap out of each other as I roar at them, drinking a beer and shouting obscenities. Sadly it's not here and I don't know why.\n\nOther than the odd glitch here and there, that's really all there is to say. There has been a lot of hate thrown at it,  45% of it is people viewing the game with rose tinted glasses to the point where they think the original was perfect in every way and had absolutely no flaws. The other 45% is people crying like babies about no online play and just throwing hate like children, simple as that. Only a few people have actually given proper criticism and helped report any flaws the game has, so take a lot of the negativity with a pinch of salt!\n\nTotally worth the asking price, and if you don't think so then wait for a deal i guess...i know i've had my monies worth, I'd just like to see the title be the brilliant game it could be.","May 23, 2014","true","24.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The manager mode may be missing but there is at least some more content regards leagues/cups for when you play single player mode. I think the difficulty could do with tweaking though as it's insanely easy in the leagues and insanely difficult in the cups until later on (even though I get that this is kind of on purpose, it needs a tweak to keep things interesting). That said, I got this one sale and although there are a tone of things that could be done to this game to improve it, I've had some fun with it. Since I paid I think 1-2 Euro for it, for that money I'll give it a thumbs up.\n\nExpect to find things you don't like about this game but it can be a bit of fun if you are ok with playing solo as there is no online multiplayer functionality.\n\n","June 27, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

All the original Amiga coding has been sliced, gutted, reworked and repackaged with a new graphics system, which does add some shinier visuals while keeping the 2d view element.\n\nUnlike some other so-called HD remakes. The gameplay systems and features offered has seen a big improvement.\nNamely, Strategic play modes, changable on the fly: Attack, Defence, balanced.\n\nLeague/cup mode.  What is essentially a career mode, allowing you to make transfers, upgrade skills and compete for league and cup supremacy.\n\n6 brand new speedball arenas.\nAnd more.\n\nTrophies and Achievements to collect, as well as trading cards\n\nThe game supports the use of joypads and controllers, although there's no real issue with standard keyboard input controls in terms of playing. Some people have said that due to the stoic 8 way control system of the original the updated version can seem like it assists throwing/scoring/passing functions. However i think this is still well balanced and doesn't have a noticable affect on the gameplay as a whole.\n\nAll the rough, violent, fast paced fun is there with extra features to keep you interested.\n\nWhile the game does feature a multiplayer mode, this is local multiplayer only. Which is the games one major downfall. It'd have been nice to be able to matchmake, take your team online and generally play with the world.\n\n\nOverall, highly recommended game :) Well worth the price.\n\n","February 12, 2015","true","4.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've been using the Xbox controller and I've been able to string some passes together, go on some dribbling runs, and the after touch is fairly easy to apply. One irritancy is the over dependence on slide tackling when you don't have the ball.\n\nThe graphics are adequate, sound ok, although it's a shame the original awesome music is missing. A nice touch is the sound effect of the old Amiga disk drive during some of the loading screens.\n\nThey have overkilled the "Ice cream!" as well. I remember hearing it once in a while during replays back in the Amiga Speedball days. You will hear it a few times every match in this remake.\n\n"HD" is stretching it but I picked it up in a sale and have definitely had some fun with it.","June 29, 2014","true","4.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

(Music is a bit different but suits the atmosphere of the game perfectly)\n\nFor anyone new to the game I would advise you to manage your team @ the gym spend your cash wisely and keep your team upgrades balanced (including your subs) and don't let the initial speed of the game fool you, once you progress to the latter stages of the game you will find out why it's called speedball :D Get Ready !","December 2, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First, the graphics are worse than in the original. Thats worth some sort of award considering that the original was released nearly 15 years ago. Other thing is the sticky ball, sometimes teleporting to a player close by. Also, in addition to the sticky ball, I think the ball itself is acting weird and feeling of the ball moving around the game area is worse than in the original. Also I noticed the ball sometimes going through a player, pretty annoying. Other weird things happening, this has happened only with goalie, when trying to charge right, towards the ball, the goalie charged left, leaving the goal wide open.\n\nEven with all this said I guess I'll have to recommend, it's a nice game if you are tired of the flash-version of original. Don't know if it because of that I've played that constantly or just that the game is bit too easy in the beginning, I now have 8 matches played, including the cup-matches in the beginning, and I've won every match so far.\n\nLittle less annoying is that there is no side change on half time and the injuries, the game is insta-stopped on injury. In the original you could play for 2-3 seconds, so incase goalie injured, you still had time to make a goal on top of that. Also double injuries happened, now its quite hard, unless you tackle 2 guys with minimum health at once.\n\nAs a conclusion, the game feels bit strange and different than the original in the beginning, but after you get used to it, the career mode and stuff like that not in the original are the reasons for recommendation.","August 18, 2014","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is exactly the same as 25 year ago, with jerky 30 fps anims. poor active character selection, and abyssimal AI. What was acceptable in 1990 feels below average today.\n\nTrue to the name the game is in HD and you won't see any pixelated gfx, however the original game used a 32 colours palette with subtle shade and nuance to great effects, this release make a very poor use of the extended palette available and the new gfx have lost the famous Bitmap Brothers "metalic look".\n\nDuring the match the game works correctly, and you can have some fun for a while, but there are small bugs here or there.  For example you can win all your league matchs by a comfortable margin but from time to time your league ranking is n't properly updated to reflect your performances. This is a serious issue in carrer mode, as there is a good chance that over the 10 seasons career one of your season will be bugged.\n\nA few modes have been added but overal there is a lack of attention to details. The gameplay is very unbalanced as most game are either too hard (sometimes) or too easy (often).\nThere is controller support for Player 1 but not for player 2 :((, moreover there is only local multiplayer.\n\nThere are 20 peoples listed in the credits including 5 programmers and 5 for QA, but the result is very disapointing, and the lack of infos and support is a shame.\n\nCertainly not worth the full price, some single player value may make it worth it on sale.","September 2, 2014","false","24.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gameplay is very fast, most of the time it's hard to see whats happening. Then starts the button mashing. One button mashing. Theres only one button you can press (excluding direction keys). So... you can kick someone in the face (no possesion) or pass/shoot the ball (possesion). No other tactical options. Very quickly you will come to a conclusion that you could be playing something a lot better than Speedball 2 HD. Then, you'll switch it off and never come back.

But: The colours are terrible and create a way too fabulous look and feel. At the same time, animations are as bumpy as back in the day, but without any of the original charme.\nThe controls are sucky. Just plain bad.\nThat not only goes for matches, but also for menus. Try doing anything in this game with a gamepad and you'll end up doing a lot of things you didn't mean to do.\nIt seems as though they have changed the gameplay for the worse. It's way too easy to win, which is partly thanks to a horrible AI. Also, I had the feeling that my players who should have been knocked out just kept going regardless.\nThe user interface is a mess. The gym functions are particularly annoying. Selected players' faces will be highlighted, but very subtly so, so you need to be extra careful not to overtrain. I didn't see any skill values in numbers, as well.\nThe music doesn't cut it, neither do the sound effects. But then again it would be hard to live up to the original.\nAll in all, a waste of time for anyone involved.

It just doesn't give me that same adrenaline rush the original gave me.  If you are a Speedball fan, I would still recommend to get it on sale.","March 8","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also you have the option to lay out tactics i.e. make your team more offensive, regular or defensive, the original game never had this. There are more cups to play, and 3 leagues the original only had 2 leagues, and boy the prem league teams are tough, but it offers a challenge at least!, also get some achievments to earn aswelll.\n\nWould recommend this for some harmless fun and quick gameplay you shouldn't take it too serious just enjoy it!\n\nThey still even got the guy saying "Icecream" like in the original when you just KO'ed the whole team! lol......","January 18","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its is just as adictive, just as frustrating and just as anoying as the original, and when you get it right and score that last second goal from the half way line to clinch the Speedball cup the cheer will be even louder than it was 20 years ago.","April 25","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
