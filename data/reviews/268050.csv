The Evil Within, Tango Gamework's first game, and its an horror game :) This game is not for everyone, its full with flashing screens and alot of gore, ALOT of gore. Blood everywhere, nasty images, lots of zombies and so many creepy creatures you wish you wont meet even in your worst nightmares. A WELL MADE HORROR GAME!\n\nStory: Im not gonna tell what this game is about, Im not gonna spoil you guys, all im gonna say its that the story behind this game its not what you thought it is... its very mysterious.. very DARK... a well made story.\n\nVoice Acting: They really put alot of effort on this game voice acting, they made them very good and very suitable to the characters.\n\nSountracks: The soundtracks of this game are incredible!! The splashing blood sound and the weapon and everything you can think of its on this game, and its well made.\n\nGameplay: The movment system isn't that smooth, but as long you're a good shooter, you should be just fine. the hitbox its a bit messed up, but after you learn to control it, its ok. The stealth modes and action scences are briliant, having the option to choose how to kill the enemy - with a knife from behind, shot it to death or trick it with a trap, or just sneak away.\n\nGraphics: It might sound sarcastic but this game is actually beautiful, even tho all the gore. But when you're in game you are just get amazed over and over again of the graphics of this game, they're awesome.\n\nDLC'S:\nThe Assignment + The Consequence:\nIf you want to play one of these DLC´s, you better just get both of them to get fully the story of each one, after all The Consequence is the sequel of The Assignment.\nThe idea of those DLC´s, which you play as Juli Kidman and you see the main game from her point of view its just huge. Its alot different of the main game, tho its also a very cool DLC that trust me you want to play!\n\nThe Executioner:\nAnother side story the developers made, on this DLC you play as The Keeper, which shows his side of The Evil Within story. This DLC story is really sad and if you ask me it really made me start thinking twice before I judge a character on a game, or just any person in real life. This one doesn't have voice acting in it, and its on a first person view, which I find really cool, its also cheap and worth the price.","July 8, 2015","true","34.4"," 231 of 278 people (83%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","83","231","278","20","15"

Bethesda plying it's hand to horror, with Shinji Mikami at the helm, it looked like everything I had ever hoped for in a horror game. Expectations were high. Then it was released and I read the negative reviews with chagrin. My heart sank. And so I waited. I tried the demo and was... underwhelmed. Finally it went on sale for 8.49US and that seemed a reasonable risk. If nothing else, the atmosphere alone was worth the sale price.\nThis is one of those games that is difficult to recommend, but the aspects that I didn't like aren't quite enough to not recommend it. The atmosphere and graphics are genius, superbly well done. The gameplay however, is lackluster and often irritating. Instead of jump-scares, there are jump-murders. You may suddenly, without any warning or provocation, be killed. The game wants to teach you how not to get killed, by killing you repeatedly. While this is not new in games, and is even much lauded in some games, it is irritating here. The learning curve is made deliberately steep, and it is not an easy game to complete.\nComplicating this aspect is the player movement mechanics, coupled with picky hit-boxes and quirky targetting for item interactions. Stealth is almost never a viable option, and renders the dev's assertions, that you can own your play-style, disingenuous. The game soon devolves into a run-n-gun, mash this button 400 times, cut-scene formula. My least favorite aspect is that the game takes over the camera far too often, making it feel as if you really have little control. It is almost a laughably absurd level of player control hijacking. I understand if the director has a vision and he just really wants you to experience it the way he intended, but it feels bullyish and invasive. This theory is backed by the fact that there are no settings to change the post-processing affects in the game. You see it the way it was intended, or not at all. These issues have been addressed in other reviews, but still, not enough to not recommend it.\nAnother aspect that has been addressed is the feeling of disconnected, disjointed levels. And the fact that this may be due to each level being an homage to other games, as if the game itself is a collection of Easter Egg levels. Many masterpieces of horror are given a nod here. While I do love the levels, it still leaves one feeling as if it's a puzzle with beautiful pieces that just don't fit together. While it may be an homage to past masters, it ends up feeling, more than anything, like Shinji Mikami's homage... to himself.\nAll in all, I have to recommend The Evil Within for hard-core horror fans, even if only for the atmosphere. That is were this game truly excells. And while I enjoyed immersing...basking...even bathing... in the environments for the very first time, the sum of all the little nit-picks prevent any desire to experience them a second time.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=579947653","December 20, 2015","true","30.4"," 136 of 152 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","136","152","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawrlex/recommended/268050/","rawrlex","Rawrlex ♥ Meowlex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawrlex/","3522 products in account","Well, i expected a lot from this Game, after all the Hype that came up before release.\n\nAnd now, after about 7 Hours Playtime im disappointed.\n\nIMPORTANT NEWS: The Game just got a 1,5GB patch that makes it finally possible to remove the "Black Bars" and to set the FPS limit from 30 to 60 without Console Commands.\nAlso all the Achievements that you were supposed to get will now unlock all at once.\nBut sadly, for me, now the Game keeps crashing randomly. Just going to uninstall, im sick of it.\nWhat is the Evil within?\nWell its supposed to be  horror Game, in my opinion it plays like a Mix of Alan Wake, Resident Evil and Saw. And it also feels so randomly cobbled together.\n\nSure if you havent played too many Horror Games yet, it will entertain you for a while.\n\nFor experienced Players,  The Evil Within doesnt have anything new to offer.\nYouve seen most things before, somewhere else, the gaming Areas are rather small, the Chapters very short. You have some Riddles to solve, but they are not really demanding. The Traps in the Game  feel like out of place... You find yourself wondering "Why would anyone put em there?"\n\nAnd lets be honest, its not really scary. For that it lacks in too many points. Youve got too many places to hide, the Enemies are too dumb, and yeah, the Areas are too small, you always know "Whatever comes along, run a few meters and the Chapter will be over fast".\n\nThat takes the thrill away for me, and is rather tiring.\n\nPro and Contra, for the lazy Readers:\n+ The Game doesnt need the surreal System Requirements shown on the Steam Storepage. Whoever put em there was probably drunk or working for Intel.\n(meaning: you dont actually need an i7, you also play fine with an i5 or equivalent.)\n+ Controls are easy to use and understand\n+ Water and Lighteffects, Shadows look good, the Fire and Cutscenes as well.\n+ Good Voiceacting.\n\n\n● You can fix the FPS and Aspect Ration problem, but you have to enter the required Console Commands everytime after starting the Game. ◄ Problem has been fixed via Patch\n● Singleplayer\n● Controller Support\n● 31 GB download\n\n- The Graphics look like The Evil Within was primarily developed for weak chested Gaming Consoles, even if they tell you otherwise.\n- Ai is just plain dumb.\n- There are a few Glitches and hideous progamming failures. (Enemies attacking walls, missing Textures, disappearing Items.)\n- Its linear, almost boring after a short Time, fails to scare the Player.\n- RPG features in a horror Game? Makes things too easy, in my opinion.\n- The Game crashes randomly after the new Patch.\n\n\nWhen i think about the Game in general, its something you can buy on sale for about $15 / 15€ and then youll be rewarded with an appropriate amount of fun, similar to the SAW game here on steam.\n\nI still can not recommend anyone to buy it.  If you dare to get it out of curiousity, please wait for a Sale!","October 13, 2014","false","16.4"," 2,720 of 3,744 people (73%) found this review helpful 70 people found this review funny","73","720","3","70","182"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/recommended/268050/","dfactor","Dfactor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dfactor/","1000 products in account","Before the actual review.\nThe devs finally added framerate cap and letterboxing options. Enabling console doesn't prevent you from getting achievements anymore. While these options should've been there from the beginning it's nice to see that these issues have been addressed.\n\nActual review.\nI'll keep it semi-short, I don't want it to be bloated. Story spoiler-free.\n\nShort introductions.\nThe Evil Within (TEW) is an oldschool survivor horror game with semi-tanky controls. If you'd ask me which games does TEW remind me of then I'd say Silent Hill, Resident Evil 4, Outlast and Alone in the Dark. If you ever played any Silent Hill title then you'll notice the familiar dirty, rust and blood covered dilapidated locations, scary mental hospital with beds and wheelchairs all over the place. The game is medium paced, which is good and bad at the same time. It's good because it doesn't get boring. it's bad because it decreases the horror factor. Puzzles are there, but really scarce and simple.\n\nThe visuals.\nThe game has some really nice lighting, reflections, shaders, particles, post processing effects and dynamic shadows. Depth of field and film grain make a really good combo here and add a lot to the experience. The locations are well made, a lot of attention to the detail, even though there are some cheap visual solutions (like 2D rock textures on water). The polygon count on most of the objects is medium, texture quality is mediocre at best. The worst textures I've noticed were the beginning (the city) and mostly rubble, no notable HD textures. City destruction is nicely looking, but is entirely scripted. Most of the animations are smooth, jerky ones have been fixed in the first patch.\n\nThe enemy types.\nThis contains some partial spoilers. Throughout the game you'll be greeted with different types of zombies (Haunted) and their sub-mutations. Just like in Resident Evil 4 you stumble upon angry villagers. Some of them will attack you with bare hands, some of them use torches, knives, hammers, sickles, molotovs and even crossbow, guns and sniper rifles. Notable mutations: invisible zombies (barely visible, fully visible on hit), two headed monsters with a surprise (AlterEgo). There are also mini-bosses and actual bosses.\n\nThe combat, mechanics and AI.\nMany people mentioned that it's like RE4 on steroids. Semi-tanky controls, you can't dodge or counter. If you get hit you're usually given time to recover and fall back. Unless it's an instakill attack. Oh yes, there are plenty of enemies in this game that can instantly kill you. But unlike in RE4 you can actually move while you aim and now you have the option to use stealth.\n\nYou can sprint (uses stamina), run and duckwalk. You can't shoot while you're duckwalking as it's meant for stealth kills (you sneak up behind enemies) and trap disarms. There are two types of traps: hidden ones that can be simply disarmed by holding the button (bear traps, string triggered dynamite, etc) and more obvious, but dangerous sticky bombs. You disarm them by pressing the button at the right time, otherwise it explodes. Each trap gives you crafting material. Check weapons sections for more about that. If you accidentally activate a trap then you can expect: small to high health loss or instant death.\n\nThe game has RPG elements. Throughout the game you'll find green gel (that is used to upgrade various physical abilities and even weapon effects), ammo, materials, collectibles and matches. There's health regeneration. If your health drops below ~20HP then you'll be unable to sprint, but you're able to recover it back just by standing. Your melee consists of slapping and kicking enemies. Useful for finishing off or pushing away zombie type enemies, but generally not recommended for more serious enemies. Stamina bar enables you to sprint. The default sprint time is around 3 seconds and when stamina is below 30% you slow down to usual speed. If it reaches 0 then you stop completely and catch your breath (completely vulnerable).\nYou can upgrade your ammo capacity and weapon efficiency (damage, fire rate, reload times, accuracy, clip size, etc).\n\nStealth is a nice addition (works only on Haunted). You sneak behind the enemies and instantly kill them. This works in following scenarios: a) the enemy is standing in one place; b) the enemy is patrolling back and forth. You have a lantern which is your own source of light. It really helps to see where are you going, makes you clearly see the traps but also gives away your position to the enemies. Making loud noises (slam open a door) also can catch enemy attention. Knowing that you can use glass bottles to either distract them or stun them by throwing the bottle against their head (after that you're given time to stealth kill them). Stealth killing is a nice way to conserve ammo and if you have the chance to do so - go for it. If you get spotted then you can deal with them the usual way.\n\nEnemy attack patterns are worth a mention. Most simple ones are punches (or swings with the weapons), kicks and dash attacks. Dash attacks of melee zombies are quite dangerous as they go into berserk mode and try to hit at least 3 times. Crossbow/gun enemies usually take time to aim at you and then shoot. Sniper rifle enemies hide behind cover and then take their time to shoot at you. Shooting a zombie in the knee usually makes them fall. All of the enemies are weak against fire. if you have matches then you can burn corpses (REmake style), hay or even downed still alive enemies (hence shooting in the knee). Igniting something will set on fire all nearby enemies. You'll stumble upon plenty of corpses throughout the game, some of them can be used to ignite other enemies. Some of them can become alive depending on your actions (so it may be wise to burn some before you pick up an item or activate a mechanism).\n\nThe enemy AI is also mediocre and could've been better. As soon as they spot you they'll start moving or running towards you. Detection sometimes fails and they spot you when you're behind them, crouching. Sometimes they might get stuck, run in circles or simply charge at you and end up running against the wall. I've also seen some weird patrol patterns. Like I mentioned before loud noises alert them (be it doors or you stepping in a trap). To avoid direct confrontation you can either hide in closets or below beds and tables or use the traps against them. Most notable con is the big amount of enemy invulnerability frames (you shoot, but they don't react / take no damage).\n\nIn some chapters you'll stumble upon your partner. Shouldn't be too problematic as you can heal your partner by just standing next to 'im and holding a button. No need to share your ammo either.\n\nWeapons.\nSemi-traditional Resident Evil layout. Handgun (revolver), shotgun, crossbow (with different bolts), sniper rifle, magnum, rocket launcher. Most are upgradable, crossbow is worth a special mention. You find different bolt types for it, after that you can craft them from materials gathered from the levels and traps. Bolt types: harpoon, proximity explosives, flashbang, electric shock, freeze and DLC ones. Useful in combination with other weapons.\n\nDue to character limit I'll have to wrap it up aka tl;dr version.\nTEW offers a nice oldschool survivor horror experience, the locations and atmosphere are nice, but it's far from perfect either. Some chapters are more action centered and the game becomes zombie slaying action game (like Resident Evil 4 Chapter 5 island parts). I don't think that arena style battles (especially against enemies with weapons) was a good idea either. There are cheap deaths, especially in escape sequences, but in the end even with all its flaws I would recommend the game as it's entertaining and fun to play.\n\nI couldn't fit in the full review, so ask me questions in the comments.","October 16, 2014","true","78.1"," 476 of 647 people (74%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","74","476","647","16","34"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulf/recommended/268050/","Vulf","Vulf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulf/","298 products in account","A truly fantastic video game, who's full potential is lost amongst a miasma of corporate-publisher bulls**t, extremely low quality testing and 'questionable' design decisions.\n\nFor every one thing this game does right, there are 10 things it did wrong looming in the shadows, ready to jump out and ruin the experience. It's visually impressive with an amazing atmosphere, but it runs like crap. It can be set to 60FPS, but it's made immediately clear that it was never meant to do that, resulting in nasty screen tear and other visual issues. It's more than happy to crash on you and save points are few and far between for most of the game. A mild checkpoint system kicks in eventually, all too late I might add. The characters look good and have fine animations, but the dialogue between them is stiff and unnatural. Nobody asks important questions like "What's going on here?". Spoiler:  There's a scene where your support character, Joseph, undergoes an RE4 style *Changing into an enemy and attacks*, but you simply shove him off and he returns to normal. For some reason they don't feel the need to talk about what just happened and continue as if it never did  , one example among many I assure you.\n\nIf you can get past the performance and character issues, then the Publisher issues kick in. It seems that this game was going to be much closer to Silent Hill and less like Resident Evil. This is demonstrated for most of the early game, I'd say at least the first 5 chapters. But I imagine Bethesda coming to Tango Gameworks and saying "A game that is not 90% combat is not going to sell, so put more combat in the game", because that's exactly what happened. From chapter 6 until the end of the game is a non-stop rollarcoaster of very, very bad combat sections. Suddenly it becomes obvious that the game wasn't built with combat in mind. Aiming a gun causes the camera to zoom in by a ridiculous amount, making aiming genuinely difficult in a game consisting mostly of tight and narrow levels. Melee is utterly useless, you've probably heard enough about that from others by now. Almost every boss in the game is a one-hit-kill to you if they get into range (I am not exaggerating, the bosses in this game are perhaps the worst bosses I've ever seen), and just like Resident Evil 6, they just keep coming back over and over again removing any sense of satisfaction from defeating them. To top this off, some of the weapons really get brokenly powerful if upgraded right. The Crossbow has bolts that can be upgraded to do 240% more damage per shot to enemies and cause them to catch fire, or stun every enemy in a room and leave them vulnerable to be stealth-killed (A single button) for up to 16 seconds. Yes, 16 seconds. This ammo can be manufactured by the player at will too. Please keep in mind, this is supposed to be a Survival Horror game, by a company well versed in this genre.\n\nBut enough about the combat, carrying on with the Publisher bulls**t, some of the most powerful equipment in the game is pre-order bonus only, such as Incendiary Bolts. While most of the bolts in the game need to be upgraded to be useful, the Incendiary Bolts are instant-kills against any enemies, including groups in range and are extremely powerful against most bosses in the game too. The story is never explained well either. This is something else I'm sure you've heard many people complaining about, such as the deeply unsatisfying ending, but it is true. Character's never discuss the important parts of the game, and the story as a whole is full of loopholes. It smacks of bad writing, until you realize that the story was left this way intentionally because it's going to be explained in the future DLC. That's right, they're pulling the EA Tactic, buy the game now and then pay more later for the privilege of being allowed to experience the full story.\n\nSummary:\n\nIf you really like character-action games in horror settings, like Resident Evil 4 or the Dead Space series, then stick with what you already have. This game is not the next big RE4. It will not deliver what you want.\n\nIf you love Survival Horror games then The Evil Within is sure to disappoint. From its mounted-turret sections to its QTE's to its one-shot-kill recurring boss fights... It is just too crippled from it's performance and design issues and is just not satisfying to complete. Nothing happens in the end to make the struggle worth while.\n\nIf you love Shinji Mikami, like I do, and want to follow his work then Resident Evil Remake has just been released in the form of a HD Remastered version. Pick that up instead.\n\nEDIT (July 1st 2015)  Thank you to all who supported my review and agreed with me, and to those who found the review helpful. I've re-read my review a few times, I've recently tried to play Evil Within again, and I have watched a Let's Play of Evil Within since finishing it myself. Nothing has changed in my opinion, and I still stand by what I have said in my review. Thanks to the LP I've watched I can also confirm that not only is the game crash-happy on PC, but also on PS4 as well (I didn't even know a PS4 could blue-screen crash, but apparently it can).\n\nIn other news, I've recently finished 2 of the 3 DLC packs for this game. The Assignment and The Consequence are quite a step up from the main game, they do more to explain the story and they are much shorter than the main game (Which I feel is a good thing), however they still suffer from many of the main games gameplay faults (Such as one-hit-kill bosses, single-use melee weapons, etc). I tried my best to play and finish the third DLC, The Executioner, but alas the game glitched out on me and I was unable to proceed (See what happened here, for those of you still saying the game has no technical issues - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VehFo-QMur4 I severely lack the motivation to try again.","January 24, 2015","false","31.1"," 377 of 507 people (74%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","74","377","507","32","50"

Where Resident Evil 4 was the kind of risk-taking venture seldom seen by a major gaming studio for one of its flagship franchises particularly when those franchises are the bread and butter income generators for the company, The Evil Within plays out more like a craftsman that is honing and refining his talents.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=360262855\nOver the years with Silent Hill offering diminishing returns with each dismal sequel (the hey day of the brilliance of Silent Hill 2 had long since faded) and with Resident Evil focusing more on Michael Bay theatrics a new kind of survival horror emerged, one which had very little place for weaponry, requiring its players to run and hide rather than engage in fights of attrition with the things that go bump in the night. Thanks to studios like Frictional Games (Amnesia - The Dark Descent), Red Barrels (Outlast) and Creative Assembly (who delivered the pinnacle of this new wave of horror with the excellent Alien: Isolation) the name of the game had officially changed. Was there still a place left for the kind of gaming Mikami had helped define when he created Resident Evil all those years back? I didn't think so and for a long while whilst playing The Evil Within I was not convinced. My first initial thoughts of the game after a few hours was that Mikami was trying to resurrect a corpse that had long since died. Despite middling reviews and major performance issues the game still managed to shift a decent amount of copies (about 1.3 million units) across all platforms setting a record for first month sales with regards to a new IP for survival horror.\n\nIt took a while for me to warm to The Evil Within's charms (I had initially written it off as a piece of nostalgic fluff that belonged to a different era of gaming). Thanks to games like Amnesia, Outlast and Alien: Isolation my brain was now hard-wired for a different kind of survival horror experience and not the experience The Evil Within was offering. While I had no doubt of the brilliance of Mikami, I couldn't help shake the nagging feeling that he had somehow missed the boat with The Evil Within. Those initial reactions were not helped by the fact that the game was released in a near broken state with sluggish performance plagued by crashes to desktop. The use of widescreen bars and excessive system specs did little to quell the PC gaming crowd that The Evil Within was more than likely going to end up being a trashy console port. One has to hand it to Tango Works though because rather than just letting the game languish on the PC in the sorry state it found itself in they went about listening to the community tweaking the engine for better performance, removing the 30fps cap and widescreen bars for those who didn't buy into the theory that they existed purely to give the game a more cinematic approach.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=360315054\nAfter having finally completed The Evil Within I can see this was the direction Mikami wanted the Resident Evil series to follow. You can almost see The Evil Within as a continuation of what Mikami started with Resident Evil 4 as they both resemble one another so closely in format and style that it becomes unmistakable that they were created by the same person. While I found the game to be a tad bit more action orientated than what I was initially expecting there is no denying that a survival horror heart beats strongly underneath all the set pieces. While I would hesitate to call the game scary it certainly manages to up the creepy factor once the story finally kicks into high gear eventually ending up being an all round enjoyable experience. I  did, however, find the lead character, Sebastian Castellanos, to be a bit of a wish-washy, drab protagonist that never seems to fill the the spaces the developers have created for him in the same way cocky Leon S. Kennedy dominated Resident Evil 4's every frame. Ultimately I am glad that I stuck it out because after the cut-copy-paste from Resident Evil 4 experience that is the games first four chapters, The Evil Within finally settles into its own convoluted yet disturbing rhyme despite the feeling of déjà vu permeating the entire experience.\n\nNarrative wise - The Evil Within is typically Japanese as it veers frequently from the absurd to the outlandish often making very little sense. It's a convoluted mess of a plot that I am not even going to try and recount here in this review (I will let you experience it for yourself) that shouldn't really work yet somehow does in a way that only the Japanese know how to pull off. Voice acting is a bit of a hit and miss affair with the lead character sounding as though he is about to doze off at any given minute despite the chaos that engulfs him. Graphically, while the game certainly looks nothing next-gen, The Evil Within still manages to create a playground that is believably sick and twisted and easy on the eye. From a gameplay standpoint the game plays very much like any 3rd person adventure released over the last decade since Resident Evil 4 introduced us to the over the shoulder camera.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=360177155\nWhile I initially had my doubts about The Evil Within after the first few hours writing it off as nothing more than a generic Resident Evil 4 clone, the game does eventually develop its own crazy personality the further you press on and despite my initial reactions I ended up thoroughly enjoying myself. While The Evil Within may not be the bold game changer many of us were hoping it to be, it's certainly a well made and enjoyable experience once you stop comparing the game to Mikami's other past successes and just accept it on its own terms. With that being said, however, I do hope to see Mikami challenge himself a bit more in the future. While it's understandable that he would want to play it safe for his companies first big release one only has to consider his iconic status as a gaming idol to know that he is capable of so much more.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","February 4, 2015","true","55.0"," 305 of 446 people (68%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","68","305","446","20","14"

It's basically Resident Evil 4, but with an even more nonsensical plot, an unsatisfying weapon/character upgrade system, and lackluster gunplay.\n\nThere's very little horror in this game - if you want a horror-themed shooter, go play F.E.A.R., because all you'll get here is some dirty, grimy settings that try to squick you out with blood and gore. There's one, and only one, decent horror scene, and that's fairly early in the game...everything else takes the Saw route of "horror" with 90% of the game being basically just torture porn. Most of what little scares they try to provide are nothing more than jump scares. Then again, I am particularly difficult to unnerve, so this is a very subjective complaint.\n\nThe plot is horribly explained, at least for what little they actually bother to tell you. You're never told what the antagonist's plans or goals are; hell, you go through the entire game learning next to nothing about even your two partners. The main character is boring at best and completely unlikeable at worst. They try to give him some character development via bits of journals you can pick up during the game, but it's not enough to redeem what's just a very boring character. He has only one conversation of note during the entire game that gives any sort of look into his psyche, and that conversation ends after two lines about his alcoholism. Due to the setting of the game, you're whisked around from location to location on a whim - the game plays very loose with its deus ex machina. By the way, the phrase "deus ex machina," is particularly relevant to this storyline, so I don't use it lightly; it is LITERALLY a deus ex machina. I'd say the story is full of plot holes but, to be frank, so little is explained that I'm not sure; it's hard to find a plot hole in a big pile of absolutely nothing. You get more plot explanation from the model viewer's info dumps than what you're told or shown in the entire course of the game.\n\nThe upgrade system seems shoehorned in. What's this green liquid? Why does it increase your ability to put more shotgun shells into a shotgun? Why do you need to shock your brain to know how to carry more matches? Narrative nonsense aside, many of the upgrades are useless: you barely need to upgrade your stock since the game does not give you enough ammunition to take full advantage of the extra space, you don't need to hold more healing syringes because most of the attacks that can kill you are one-hit kill grabs, there are very few situations where extra sprint is useful (and during all of those the game actually gives you an unlimited sprint bar anyway), and upgrading the explosive range of your explosive crossbow bolts can actually be detrimental since it hurts you as well. The only useful upgrades I found were the damage upgrades for the main three weapons (revolver, shotgun, and sniper rifle). Here's a tip, by the way: there's a missable magnum in chapter 11. I didn't get it, ended the game with an inventory full of magnum rounds, and was ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to find out from the wiki that you only get two chances at the gun in that one chapter.\n\nI compared this game to Resident Evil 4 initially, but, really, that's a disservice to RE4. That game's shooting mechanics were far tighter, it didn't have a wonky stealth system that sometimes just doesn't work, and the bosses in that game were far more entertaining to fight than in this game. Nearly all of the bosses in The Evil Within have at least one instant kill grab attack, which wouldn't be so bad if the game allowed you to skip the cutscenes (I can't recall a single cutscene before a boss that can be skipped, despite the game allowing you to skip cutscenes during other parts of the game) that happen before AND DURING some boss fights. There's a fight against one particular boss, the Keeper (the enemy with a combination safe for a head), where if you die you'll have to sit through 2 cutscenes DURING THE FIGHT. EVERY TIME YOU DIE. That's not good game design, Bethesda!\n\nAs for technical issues, it crashed on me twice during gameplay (of which I put in ~15 hours, I think). Not sure what that was about. Other than that it runs fine enough. I didn't notice any obvious framerate problems, graphical glitches, etc. Not stellar, but passable on that front.\n\ntl;dr If the game had either good gameplay or a good plot I might recommend it. However, it has neither. This is simply, in my opinion, not a good game. It's not worth your time and it's certainly not worth your money, even during this current sale. My recommendation instead, if you want a horror shooter? Go and get F.E.A.R., and if you like that, get the sequel (stay away from F.3.A.R, though). If you want a third-person shooter with "zombies?" Go and play Resident Evil 4. Either way, you'll have a lot more fun than you would with this game.\n\nAddendum 04/09/15:\nI guess I need to clarify something, since multiple people over the last few months have brought it up. I didn't say F.E.A.R. was scary. I said it was a better horror-themed shooter. I said this for two reasons.\n\n1) It's a better horror-themed shooter not because it's scary, but because the atmosphere is more unsettling. Granted, that's a subjective assessment, but see if you can understand where I'm coming from. Most of The Evil Within depends on walls splattered with offal, grates that shoot fire, and gigantic swimming pools of blood to try and unnerve the player; F.E.A.R. depends on dark, enclosed spaces, and an unbeatable and unknowable evil behind potentially every corner. The Evil Within had a very similar character and powerset in its main villain compared to F.E.A.R.'s Alma, but Alma was used more effectively and made her presence more well-known (even if she was a rather tired example of the "black-haired evil little girl" popularized most recently by movies like The Ring and The Grudge). Many times I wondered when I would next see Alma and dreaded it; my only emotion in seeing Ruvik was exasparation that I'd have to suffer through another chase sequence. The Evil Within spent a large quantity of time (not most of the time, but a significant portion) in brightly lit, sunny, outdoor areas where enemies were plainly visible well ahead of time; F.E.A.R. is set mostly in an office building, so even when the lights are on enemies can be hidden behind office furniture, doors, etc., and your only clue to their existence is radio chatter.\n\n2) It's a better horror-themed shooter because it's a BETTER SHOOTER. Strip out all of the supposed horror elements, regardless of whether you find them scary or not, and what you're left with is, almost objectively, a better shooter in F.E.A.R. than in The Evil Within. Better (and more entertaining) weapon variety, better enemy reaction to being damaged, better enemy A.I., better gunplay, a better melee system, a better stealth system despite not even HAVING a stealth system...granted, all of that is subjective, but how many of you are going to honestly say that sans the supposed horror The Evil Within makes a better shooter than F.E.A.R. sans its supposed horror?\n\nEveryone's free to disagree with my points. We all have different opinions and it's more than likely that I've made misguided or even outright incorrect statements somewhere. I don't mind being called out on those. But it's important to note that nowhere in the review did I call F.E.A.R. scary. While I was brought to the edge of my seat more often in F.E.A.R. than I was in The Evil Within, I didn't once say it was scary. I never even once used the word "scary" in the review. Not once. I said it was a better horror shooter.","November 26, 2014","false","17.1"," 588 of 893 people (66%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","66","588","893","30","47"

This review is also available in video format for your convenience below.)\n\nIt has been almost a decade since Shinji Mikami has worked with the survival horror genre that he helped pioneer. Other than a few notable games, there has been a large emphasis on mass appeal and action within the industry in recent years. Mikami and his studio Tango Gameworks took a knowing risk when they decided to step back into a genre that's largely secluded to small indie projects now to bring us The Evil Within.\n\nThe game begins with the player controlling Sebastian Castellanos as he arrives at the scene of a massacre within the walls of the Beacon Mental Hospital. Upon checking the surveillance feed things immediately take a turn for the worse as he's hurled into a nightmare that has him fighting for survival throughout a wide variety of locations uncovering the truth behind this madness. After the initial first chapter, Evil Within begins to feel like it's straddling the line between two great survival horror games. The solid shooting, reactive enemies, and elegant art style of Resident Evil 4 and the psychologically rooted story, symbolic creature design, and occasional dark industrial music and level design of Silent Hill 2, with a few homages to Resident Evil thrown in for good measure. While The Evil Within doesn't offer much innovation outside of the amalgamation of these two titles, outside of a competent stealth component, it certainly borrows well from good material.\n\nOn the default Survival difficulty, The Evil Within will keep you scavenging the levels for every bit of ammo and healing supplies that you can find. You'll be encouraged to dispose of enemies stealthily whenever possible to conserve precious ammunition. While the stealth doesn't offer anything innovative and sticks to basic sneaking up from behind to execute enemies. It works well enough to provide a nice change of pace and tension. The gun play is immensely satisfactory as enemies blow apart in a mess of gore, this also has a direct effect on difficulty as enemies will often take multiple shots to the head to dispose of, if you blow a hole straight through their hideous faces, you'll now have a smaller target to hit in the remaining facial tissue. With enough practice one can master the strict aiming controls and incorporate real-time dodging through use of the sprint and duck functions. Expect to die a few times before completing the 15-20 hour campaign that will unlock further challenges for masochists. The Evil Within stays true to its Survival Horror roots by offering a rewarding experience, through intelligent utilization of resources, a dark atmospheric level design, and punishing game-play.\n\nWhile some areas of the Evil Within offer plenty of tension it isn't going to win any scariest game rewards. However, it manages to stay eerily engrossing enough to play for long periods of time and absorb you into it's richly detailed world. The boss encounters are all well executed, requiring unique strategies for each, with a couple of them requiring multiple encounters, raising the level of difficulty each time you're unfortunate enough to cross paths.\n\nTo help alleviate the rising difficulty of the enemies you'll be able to upgrade Sebastian's abilities and weapons using green gel, found throughout the campaign, whenever he enters the game's equivalent of a save room. Additionally there will be dozens of files and other documents to find that flesh out the story as well as small keys, that are usually found in small statues that unlock a series of lockers containing random items in the save room. The Evil Within certainly knows how to reward you for thorough exploration of its excellent environments but is also all too familiar with punishment as well. Along the path, you'll frequently stumble upon traps that can seriously injure Sebastian if not disarmed. Disarming a trap rewards you with parts that can be used for crossbow ammunition, while some are easier to disarm than others, it creates another risk/reward mechanic of deciding whether you want to try and risk disarming a trap or proceed forward sans parts but with your life intact. The trap system is a much welcomed mechanic as it kept my ego in check as I was quickly made paranoid of the few times I got cocky enough to run around areas that seemed uninhabited by monsters.\n\nThere was also a decision to make the game have an ultra widescreen letterbox aspect ratio, this can be fixed via the developer console but unfortunately that just ends up cutting off the left and right sides of the screen. It's also worth noting that any use of the developer console disables achievements for the game. The only way I was able to alleviate this issue was by dragging my desktop over to my TV so that I could play on a large enough screen where letterboxing wasn't an issue.\n\nThe plot is good enough to keep things moving along and provide explanation to everything happening to Sebastian. That being said though many people will be left confused or underwhelmed by the ending if they failed to piece together everything presented in the files, or decided to skip reading them all together. I personally appreciate a game that reveals the story through various storytelling means rather than direct exposition. While the creature design and environments are very well done they still don't match up to the level set by titles like the Resident Evil Remake. This could partially be due to the fact that you're moved through the game quickly with very little revisiting environments so less attention was paid to each area as well as the drastic differences of the disconnected locations. One minute you might be in an old deteriorating mansion, then suddenly you're in a field just prior to being transported to a crumbling city. You won't have that feeling of attachment and familiarity that you get playing older survival horror games, but considering how the narrative plays out and what's responsible for the locations perhaps that makes sense.\n\nThe audio is haunting as creatures announce their presence to you through their wet obstructed breathing or through agonizing shrills and screams. Debussy's “Clair de Lune” is effectively used to ominously telegraph the location of save rooms and menacing mechanical clanking and roaring heightens the threat of danger. The voice acting is competently done with one of the characters looking like a dead ringer for Anthony Hopkins but the soundtrack is somewhat sparse compared to other titles utilizing silence and noises to create suspense and atmosphere. Additional atmospheric music would've gone a long way for some of the areas.\n\nWhile playing it a bit safe, The Evil Within manages to be a fantastic survival horror game. It brings with it intelligent gameplay, an atmospheric world, a high level of difficulty, and great art direction. It falls a bit short in the horror department, it could've used a deeper story or more fleshed out characters, more puzzles would've been nice and a greater attention to detail with less of a rush through environments similar to older Resident Evil titles. Chapter 9 manages to hit a high note in regards to all this but is unfortunately short lived. While not the masterpiece it could have been, The Evil Within still manages to be an outstanding game. It's going to be polarizing as it's a step away from the mindless mass appeal that most people shell out cash for today but if you're in the market for a great survival horror game in the tradition of Resident Evil 4, you won't be disappointed.\n\n\nThis review is also available in video format for your convenience:\n\nhttp://youtu.be/iUV4CiChFrg\n\nPros:\n+ Fantastic Gameplay\n+ High Difficulty\n+ Great Art Direction\n+ Excellent Sound Design\n\nCons:\n- Poorly done PC Port with letterboxing and a 30FPS limit.

They won't be scary by round 2 and flat out boring by round 3.\n-Bad pacing of scares/action.\n-They start off pushing a clunky stealth system and then almost never use it.\n-Enemy AI is terrible as far as alerting them goes. I shot one 10 feet from his friend and he didn't come looking for me. They also don't react to seeing the light of your lantern in an otherwise pitch black room.\n-Non-existent character development. You'll know almost nothing about any of the exceptionally dry characters in the game by the time credits are rolling.\n-They never address why the hell Sebastian was collecting jars of brain goo unprompted. I mean, it worked out that it's his currency for upgrade but was he just doing this on a typical day too? This guy has issues.\n-The story is non-existent for the first half of the game and it's pretty awful once it gets going.\n-The enemies trade in anything creepy for guns as the game goes on. It will just feel like a generic 3rd person shooter at times instead of one claiming to be survival horror.\n-No dedicated punch and stomp button. Want to punch that guy in front of you? Too bad! Stomp on that corpse instead! You died lol\n-Only 4 quickslot spots when you have more than 4 weapons alone. That doesn't take into account healing items or grenades. Time doesn't stop when you're trying to get your shotgun back out in a pinch.\n-The ammo caps are set as ammo not in your gun currently. If you can hold 4 extra shotgun shells and you have 4 not in your empty shotgun currently, you'll need to reload before picking more up. This is especially bad with the crossbow and it's crafting system. Want 3 bolts? Craft one, equip bow, equip desired bolt, craft two more. Keep in mind this will be done in real time while enemies maul you.\n-Lots of deaths just felt cheap. An underwater beartrap in front of a bomb. Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?\n-Super widescreen aspect ratio that forces horizontal black bars on your screen. You can change this but then you're zoomed in horribly far and there will be graphical glitches where the bars should be.\n-This game really chugs along. After using the 60 fps console command, I played this on a GTX 770 at 1920x1080 and it was averaging about 40 fps. It averaged 50 at 1280x720 on all the lowest settings.\n-All the minor design and control flaws just make it feel like an offbrand RE4.","October 19, 2014","false","17.2"," 278 of 421 people (66%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","66","278","421","21","23"

This is something I wish more people would realise, instead of criticizing it for how non-Resident Evil it is.\n\nI absolutely love the ID Tech 5 engine. The graphics in The Evil Within are among some of the strongest I've ever seen. The whole game is dripping in atmosphere and I felt completely immersed. It's also incredibly violent, and Tango Gameworks have gone to a lot of trouble to provide a AAA experience. They really captured the essence of horror and anyone who thinks otherwise clearly hasn't seen enough oldschool scary movies.\n\nIt's also quite a long game. Took me 12 hours to beat the main story and there's New Game+ and a couple other interesting modes to complete. There's definitely a lot of replay value to unlock all of the hidden secrets/collectibles.\n\nI'd definitely recommend getting The Evil Within if you're a fan of horror in general.

It rode the hype train all the way to its release.  People boarded, they drank and ate frivolosly as they spoke of their excitement for the title amongst themselves (Myself included) But when the train arrived at a concentration camp and we were herded out to a firing line and systematically shot, we began to complain.  Is it our fault?  Of course it is, but all the blame does not fall upon us alone.  The Evil Within as a whole is not a "Bad" game.  Several hours of entertainment can be found within, but for those expecting to be swept up into a AAA horror look elsewhere.\n\nPoor ports seem to be the bread and butter of the porting scene.  This game, although playable, is poorly optimized for its PC consumer base. A "widescreen" picture (Two large horizontal black lines at the top/ bottom of the screen) that can not be removed without some small degree of tech savvy file modding) takes away from the overall gameplay.  Frame locked to any degree is a sure fire way to ♥♥♥♥ everyone in the PC world off, and a windowed mode that doesn't truly allow for "Windowed mode" are just a few things on the list of recommended things to be altered, improved, or altogether removed.\n\nSome may argue that issues arise with all games and to that I agree, to an extent.  There are simply too many variables to be able to cover all issues for all the varying degrees of hardware/software out there.  However, things like locked frames, although many say this issue is self fixable, should not be released in a AAA title with a price tag of 60 dollars.  Others will express that the fixes will come in time and to be patient.  To them I give a hearty, ♥♥♥♥ you.  Order a pizza dinner for 40 bucks have it show up three hours later and be the completely wrong order to which the proprietor of the establishment, after you are forced to call or suffer through the wrong order, tells you they will remake your order and send it out to you....most likely in another three hours.

What should've been a Survival Horror reimagining ends up retreating old ground before deciding that it wants to go into the modern day Survival Horror stables of... well, not really existing all that much.\n\nI'll avoid the technical issues, the framerate, etc. Those are issues which one can learn to look past. I'll approach my personal grievances with the actual game.\n\nThe game begins right, it's a confusing jumbled mess but you're somewhat terrified of being grabbed or spotted by the nearest enemy and being killed. I've escaped reloads by using the many scattered environmental stealth cabinets/beds and the feeling of looking at the enemies walk into the room was pushing all the right buttons.\n\nThat was until I realized how simple the enemies were. Maybe I'm just disappointed because I finished Alien: Isolation not too long ago but the fact that enemies won't search the room and simply return to the environment which they usually hang out was soul-crushingly disappointing.\n\nHiding under the bed when the entire room has no windows, no closets and the enemies saw me walk into the room should be silly. It shouldn't work that way. This stealth system is poorly implemented if it's going to last the entire gam-\n\nWait, no. That's the biggest offender right there. Stealth becomes irrelevant not even 1/4 through the game. As your arsenal expands, the enemies grow weaker in the sense that they're not as intimidating as they were anymore. The first few enemies wielding knives and being all disfigured was intimidating, I didn't want to fight two of them in close proximity but soon enough, you'll end up being swarmed by hordes of them and not even flinch.\n\n"Surely there's more enemy than knife-wielding zombies, right?" you may ask. And you'd be right but this is the core of the problem. The way to balance out your growing arsenal was giving the enemy more of an arsenal, knives and axes slowly phase out and are replaced with guns. Any element of survival horror which the game established becomes thin at this point, only showing up when the story deems it necessary before throwing you into another action sequence.\n\nThe amount of times which I'm thrown into an action sequence with little to no ammo and cannot progress unless I kill everything frustrates me, you're telling me to use everything so I've got nothing to use in the next scene and it creates an exercise of frustration where you're trying to melee the enemy and avoid their ridiculously easy to dodge pattern but it isn't fun.\n\nPerhaps the sense of terror will return, perhaps there's some semblance of the game which the first horror had shown me can exist in this action shooter with zombies affair. However, until I witness it, I'd say no to The Evil Within.","October 14, 2014","false","6.6"," 467 of 745 people (63%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","63","467","745","7","9"

Like most people, I got hyped up for the game by seeing TV and online advertisements and hearing about how Shinji Mikami planned take the game back to the Resident Evil 4 days. More or less, the game is basically Resident Evil 4 2.0(I'll let you decide if that's a bad thing). It uses many of the tropes and themes from Resident Evil 4 and other Resident Evil games very fequently. One of the things I noticed is that it uses the 'person crouching and they turn around and they're scary' trope from the first Resident Evil game to the point where it becomes noticable. It's almost like they were trying to recreate that scare that freaked so many gamers out but it just doesn't work because they're already so used to it now and it's already been done. If you played Resident Evil 4, you pretty much played The Evil Within.\n\nThe game starts off promising enough, throwing you right into the survival horror action. The game has a pretty strong start but unfortunately starts to go downhill from there. I really wouldn't call The Evil Within a horror game, it's more like a third-person action shooter game with spooky enemies broken up by intense thriller moments. Sneaking and hiding is recommended but enemies always seem to turn around and notice you right when you're about to sneak kill them, and i think I used the hiding mechanic in the game only a handful of times. 99% of the time, going in guns blazing is the best way to get through an area or deal with a group of enemies. Another thing I would like to mention is how diffcult the game gets at points. I'm one for a challenge, but there are parts and sections of the game that just feel unfair. At points, you will run out of ammo while being chased by a group of enemies with no way to kill them(even if you used your ammo liberally), and at others Sebastian will blantaly miss headshots from 2 feet infront of him that seem impossible to miss. It becomes less of a challenge that you can complete with enough skill to something that just seems unfair and frustrating.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Fun gunplay, it feels satisfying to shoot things and cause blood to spray out everywhere.\n\n-Good pacing\n\n-Pretty intense heart pumping moments at certian sections in the game\n\n-Effects and music give off a creepy atmosphere(I especially liked The Keepers effects)\n\nCONS:\n\n-Game becomes so unfair at points that it leads to an artificial difficulty that will leave you frustrated.\n\n-Scares are predictable, and the scares it tries are overdone\n\n-Graphics are nothing to look at(this has been talked about many times before, but I was running this on a Titan Black and the graphics are extremly sub-par for a hyped up 2014 title)\n\n-Black Bar\n\n-Controls can be clumsy, Sebastian can(and will) take the slow moving ladder down when you tell him to jump off right as a enemy with a chainsaw is about to take off your head and you'll find yourself running into low rising walls that you want to jump over many times.\n\n-The Story. Stories in survival horror games are a big part of the experience for me and The Evil Within fails to deliver. Even if you collect all the notes you're left with so many loose ends and questions. The story is so cryptic and confusing and you never learn the answers for the big questions that it's really not worth following in the long run(the story is so bad that they're releasing a 2 part dlc that Explains things from Kidmans side that is supposed to clear up things and tie up the loose ends. but should you REALLY have to buy a DLC to understand the story?)\n\n-Insanity is a boring overplayed trope in horror games, and this game follows to the T the generic forumla of insanity based horror games.\n\n-The voice acting is extremly bland, actors deliver their dialog with very little emotion and it sounds out of place and laughable whenever a character tries to respond to the horror going on around him\n\n-The game went on for a little longer than it should have. A lot of the ending chapters were 'Get from part A to part B alive!'\n\nOverall, I wouldn't reccomend The Evil Within to a friend unless said friend is a horror games buff, then I would reccommend him to buy it while it's on sale. The Evil Within is a fun game, but at the same time a very flawed one that will leave you unsatisfied with what you got and wanting answers.\n\n6/10.","October 26, 2014","false","29.9"," 380 of 609 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","380","609","5","16"

I finished The Evil Within on survival difficulty, and what I have to say is somewhat different from most reviews on pc.\n\nEDIT: The game received a patch which adds a 60 fps option and also a proper option to take out the letterbox without affecting the fov, the game feels much better now although performance is still not the best, but I thank the developpers for listening and taking the time to fix this major problems, good job to them!\nFirst of all, yes, it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, it has ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, but it really never felt unplayable to me, just not optimal, it wasn't the framerate that annoyed me the most, it was the hideous field of view and the aspect ratio, but I got through those problems and decided to enjoy the game for what it was and not for the performance and graphics. I got lucky with the crashes, the game never crashed on me or anything like that, I have a r9 280x, 16gb of ram, and an i7 4770k in case that affects something in that matter.\n\nNow for the game itself, I got introduced to survival horror with franchises like Resident Evil and Sillent Hill, like most survival horror fans, and what I have to say is that if you played Resident Evil 4 you're not going to find anything new or original about this game, but you will find a lot of noustalgia and feel from that particular game. The game offers a nice set of chapters which seem very different one from another, with new enemies and environments each chapter, I liked the design of the environmens, with a nice balance of open places and claustrophobic corridors, all filled with good old school pools of blood and deceased corpses.\n\nIn terms of story, it's not that great, but it's not bad either, the characters are for the most part forgettable, with some exceptions, and the fact that the main character is not the best doesn't help at all, but the story is interesting enough and doesn't go into fillers or some random unnecessary plot twists.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay and control, it's all old school survival horror, ammo is scarce, you have your typical RE4 types of weapons (pistol,shotgun,rifle), and a new weapon which is the agony crossbow, which has a number of craftable bolts with different qualities, such as explosive or shock bolts, you can get crafting materials by disabling traps or grabing toolboxes in the environments. The movement and aiming are sluggish, often making you fail and die when enemies get to close because when aiming the pistol the camera zooms in so much and the aiming is so damn terrible that it makes it hard to shoot anything, but when you land a shot on an enemy is very satisfying, enemies react realistically to where you shoot and damage from the shot affects the models, making for some half exploded heads. Boss fights aren't anything new, but they are very fun and challenging, making you run around and try to find a way to weaken the boss or to kill him, pretty much like a RE4 boss fight would be, there's really not much of a difference.\n\nIn the end, I recommend this game for what it is to me, it's an old school horror game with a lot of gore and grewsome boss fights, it's just a shame that the port and some design choices don't hold up to the rest of the game.","October 17, 2014","true","29.7"," 226 of 361 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","226","361","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theparrotlover/recommended/268050/","theparrotlover","It's High Noon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theparrotlover/","236 products in account","The Evil Within is a survival horror game that claims to be a throwback to the "roots" of the horror genre. It throws you into a twisted world full of psychological horror. You play as Detective Castellanos as he attempts to unroot the mysterious happenings that shift the world around him. Anyways, let's get to the review.\n\nNow here's some complaints you might of heard already regarding The Evil Within, so let's just get them out of the way first. The game has some large black borders that attempt to give it a more 'cinematic' feel, you can disable these with some non-official fixes at the expense of some graphical bugs. The black borders tend to be kind of distracting, and sometimes pulling you out of the immersion for a while, until you get used to them. I'm hoping they'll have an option to disable them in-game in the future, as playing without borders really enhances the immersion. The next up is the 30 FPS lock, you can disable this using a console command to run at 60 FPS. I played the most of the game at 60 FPS and noticed no issues or problems regarding running at a framerate higher than intended. Now the optimization can be a bit poor at times. Some areas of the game give me a solid 60 frames, while others tend to drop to 45-50. It isn't terrible, but some of the textures/effects/graphics aren't very detailed enough to justify the drop, and it tends to happen in the strangest of places.\n\nNow to the meat of it all, the game can feel pretty hit-and-miss early on. I felt the beginning chapters was probably the weakest part of the game, in terms of both horror and gameplay elements. It starts off slow and tends to follow every cliche horror games to a T. The intro is filled with many stealth and tutorial sections without invoking any real tension to the situation you're in. It's a very slow start, and it can probably turn-off a few people from playing past that point. Mid-way through the chapters, the game starts feeling more like a horror game. Each level is filled with twisted, and disturbing designs; enhanced only further by some of the most gruesomely lovely character and boss design I've seen. Once the game starts picking up, it's easy to get absored in the pacing of it all. These later chapters can feel absolutely tense, and creepy.\n\nThe gameplay is very similiar to Resident Evil 4 (both being Shinji Mikami games after all). The ammo is very scarce, and the game often encourages you to used them sparingly. Each engagement with the horrors that reside the twisted realm feel challenging, but never cheap. There's a lot of thought and tactics you can put into each battle, setting up traps using the Agony Crossbow, silently taking down each enemy with a knife to the head, or using careful well-placed shots to take out multiple enemies at once. Each bullet you spend can feel rewarding when it hits, enemies react wonderfully to each shot; from a head bursting, to falling over when hit in the knee. A lot of the game encourages using your head to solve the situation at hand than rather blindly firing all of your shots. The game also features a corpse-burning mechanics, as most enemies are weak to fire. You can find matches in the game that allows you set ablaze multiple objects or a downed enemy; this fire can spread to other enemies if they're over it resulting in an instant kill. The game also features some pretty awesome boss fights as well; although they seem to appear at random. Some chapters can have 1 boss, none at all, or even multiple. They kinda come inconsistantly, but they're lots of fun.\n\nAs far as graphics go, some parts of the game can feel really weak at times, while others looking amazing with great tension-building lighting, effects, textures. It's a bit of a hit-and-miss. Some chapters can look intense and eerie, while some suffer from muddy textures and some ugliness. The worse offender is probably the beginning of the game, where it looks straight out of 2008. It's great to see some of these strange and twisted enviroments come to life, the game often has a very nightmarish surrealism to it.\n\nAs for plot goes, it tends to shroud itself in mystery until the very end of the game. It seems that the almost non-existant plot for the first half of the game is only serves as a device to take you to each new area. You'll probably find yourself scratching your head for most of the game, and probably after it ends as well. The world is filled with some collectibles that give a bit of insight into your situation, and the plot can make sense if you read a bit into it. Unfournately, the characters are pretty bland. The main protagonist feels emotionless and almost robotic, making a few remarks to remind you that you (as the player) don't even know where the ♥♥♥♥ you are, such as, "Where am I?" or "What the ♥♥♥♥?" as if you haven't seen so much bizarre things already.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed The Evil Within. Despite it's slight performance issues, sometimes muddy textures, slow beginning, and blind plot for the first half of the game. It's gameplay, artistic level design, and creepiness are more than enough to jump over it's flaws. It's a sickening lovely game that loves to play on the tropes of horror, and that's not a bad thing. It's a game definetly worth playing if you like Resident Evil 4 or just the horror shooter genre in general.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal time to complete: 15 hours.\nDifficulty completed on: Survivor (Medium)\nDifficulty scale: Challenging, it's not an easy game that's for sure.\nTotal deaths: 98\nFull price at time of review: 59.99 USD\nPrice paid for: 45.00 USD on Greenman Gaming\nPrice I suggest buying it at: 30-40 USD\nSpookiness scale: It's not completely terrifying, but it can feel very tense at times; with a few scares here and there.\n\nPros (+) and Cons (-):\n+Absolutely fantastic and challenging gameplay, requires you to think each situation through.\n+Has some great creepy levels with plenty of supernatural elements to them, much like Silent Hill or Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem\n+Wonderfully made boss fights and twisted enemy designs\n+/-The graphics can look really good at times, and look absolutely awful the next.\n+/-"I don't know what the hell the plot is for the first half of the game because it's telling me nothing, not even a vague hint"\n+/-30 FPS lock.

It does a great job at making you feel as though you've already played it. Just give me a moment. It feels like every game you have ever played. Its Resident Evil, its Eternal Darkness, it Bioshock, its Dead Space, its F.E.A.R. and Saw simultaneously. This is not an inherently a BAD thing or ideology for game development studios to adopt. It just lacks, for want of a better term, valor.\n\nThe Evil Within is fun, its nerve racking its... familiar; and it has all the bells and whistles of a modern “triple A” title. I enjoyed my time, I honestly like the game but there is something missing which leads me into this next bit.\n\nI'm about to rant\nSo ignore this next section if that's not your jam\n\nI understand that the video game industry is new and budding, at least comparatively to other forms of media; and I hate this mentality of big budget games having to be these cookie cutter pristine must follow each bullet point to the T sort of endeavors. I realize however that precisely because these big budget titles are so costly and take so much time that it is near impossible for proper business practice to try something completely off the wall.\n\nWhich is why we see the rise of the indie developer; between free engines, a programmer, writer and an artist can (CAN is important) build worlds, write stories that stick with you. Things that make you think afterward. Things that make you wonder about things in a way you didn't before. Most triple A games today are fun, they work, they give you a nice good happy fun time. But for me; these experiences are fleeting. As with going out to the theater, you've spent a lot more time and money than it took to watch at home and yet what you end up taking away from the experience of seeing the film is more likely; who you saw at the theater, how the traffic was and why was that person laughing so loud.\n\nWhat I mean to say is nothing new is emerging for triple A games. They have become this amorphous cloud of I already know what this is but I'm going to do it anyways and pretend its new sentiment.\n\nAnyways back on point.\n\n*ends rant*\n\nThe Evil Within is a very enjoyable game. You collect green gel, which I lovingly referred to as brain juice the entire game, which can be spent at a very ominous chair reminiscent of the early days of studying mental health.\n\nThe game is broken into chapters. And there is a recurring theme with looking into a mirror with what I can only describe is a very eerie and ironic song that through playing the game you'll come to find solace in as it transports you to a land where you can save, upgrade and unlock any special lockers with keys you can find hidden throughout the game. Be it, often at the expense of experiencing a psychotic episode. You also get this very rad crossbow that you can construct different type of ammo for such as trap bolts, freeze bolts and some regular ♥♥♥ exploding bolts.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=571691571\n\nTHE GIST\nAll in all, this game is exactly what you think it is and that's not a bad thing. You get to shoot, burn, explode, eviscerate, punch and claw your way through zombie hordes (or maybe not zombies?) and places designed to make your skin crawl. You just might not remember anything specific about what you did after its all over.","December 8, 2015","true","14.8"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","80","32","40","6","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Celgaming/recommended/268050/","Celgaming","Celgaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Celgaming/","941 products in account","How it was sold\n"From the makers of Resident Evil" -was the tag line this game was advertised with. That puts a heavy shadow over this game as a result and I believe it works against it. It's not a tagline that would get me to buy a copy as I'm not a big fan of where the Resident Evil series has evolved into, however I am a fan of the classic RE series.\n\nAs you play The Evil Within it becomes obvious they haven't gone far from their previous projects as "the makers of Resident Evil" and The Evil Within is like the new kid that has a big brother looming over him called Resident Evil, that it tries to emulate and copy from while awkwardly doing it's own thing.\n\nThis doesn't mean it lacks in originality, but it's hard to call this game original at all since it borrows from so many sources and horror clichés and it's hard not to roll your eyes while playing it if you play a lot of horror games or if you watch horror movies. This might be because the current horror gaming genre is over saturated by pretty bad games but what The Evil Within does try very hard to is scare you which is something it's big brother Resident Evil stopped trying to do years ago.\n\nGameplay\nIt plays like a generic third person shooter with massive influences taken from another third person horror shooter: The Last Of Us, down to collecting random scrap to create ammo and trying to sneak up on the monsters for instant kills. Monsters in this game are durable and gameplay is a mix between sneaking and "aim for the head and hope it dies".\n\nMost monsters are identical in how they fight you with minor differences in their patterns, as such the gameplay can get boring quite quickly. You go into a stage, scavenge for ammo, waste it instantly (even perfect headshots won't be enough) on a few monsters, then struggle with stealth to survive if the stage allows it and repeat that all over in the next stage.\n\nYou can upgrade your characters attributes with the "green goo" you get from random monsters or find around stages by injecting it into your brain. Upgrade types are straight out of Resident Evil from shorter reload times to 10% critical increase for kills on headshots etc. and it does allow you to customize your gameplay a little, but mainly it becomes obvious it doesn't matter a hell of a lot since you cannot buy ammo at all and that shotgun you upgraded might not get any ammo drops on the next stage making all those points spent upgrading it moot. The only weapon worth upgrading is the crossbow and it's bolts as it's the only one that you can make ammo for.\n\nThe only unique twist to the combat is the use of matches as "finishers" that are limited but sadly it becomes an awkward mechanic as most if not all monsters get up too quickly for you to utilize it. However matches are limited and I liked the added pressure for the player to have to choose which bodies he felt were worthy of burning. Cool idea but feels wasted.\n\nBoss fights in this game are also very cookie cutter "find the pattern" or "weak point" and shoot it. The monster designs are of another matter and I'll get to that a bit later. Most boss fights either waste all your ammunition or leave way too obvious ways for you to kill them like brightly coloured red barrels.\n\nThe last thing I'll mention in gameplay are the cheap instant deaths. There are a lot of them such as trip wires hidden under water you can't see, spike traps that you couldn't notice, monsters instant killing you while off screen etc. there are a lot of "well that was cheap" moments and as far as the controls go they don't help. The PC version of this game lacks good localization and moving around feels very clunky at best. Menus are a pain to move in and the inventory system seems hastily made for the PC version. Expect to be frustrated with the controls if you don't own a controller.\n\nGraphics / presentation\nThis game is pretty. It has all the luxuries of a "next gen" game in terms of lens flares, texture animation, physics and screen filters. It is a pretty looking console game and the PC version does offer 60 FPS and anti aliasing. The god awful top and lower bars are gone from the console version since you can just toggle them off and overall it's a nice looking game. The only minor thing that will only a few is the texture pop in. It's a half a second blurriness every time the camera changes scenes during cut scenes and can take you out of it but shouldn't bother most.\n\nThe game has some pretty awesome looking monster designs and segments that feel very like mini Micheal Bay movies. "Destruction porn" is the closest thing I can describe it as. It has some really interesting environments and visuals apart from a few areas at the end of the game that feel shoehorned in for a few fights but over all this game had some good visual artists working on it.\n\nStory\nIt copies from Inception heavily and adds in typical Japanese fantasy type villains and the main protagonist feels empty and void of any character. His favourite catch phrase is "♥♥♥♥" and that should tell you a lot. The very few other characters are also very bland and uninteresting, and most if not all plot elements are pretty much explained in tapes and cut scenes in very bland ways leaving nothing for player interpretation, and the twists in story are very easy predict.\n\nThe voice acting has a lot to be desired and many lines are delivered with no passion and it takes you right out of the moment. It is comparable to anime dubbing where most of the "acting" is just grunts and sighs and heavy breathing then as dry as you can be line deliveries.\n\nThe main characters whole background is littered in journals around the games "save points" and it plays no role in the actual cut scenes or arch of the main story, which leaves a bitter taste for anyone who actually searches horror games for interesting stories.\n\nThe whole story is fixated on the subject of psychology and horrors, but it is just a bad attempt at putting those two elements together and thinking this is what makes a good psychological horror game. It does not. Most horrors in this game are just cheap jump scares, loud noises and gore, gore, gore and gore. Nothing is really scary for a veteran of horror games and the game does very little in terms of advancing the genre but then again I don't think that's what it's trying.\n\nIt IS trying to scare you WITH a horror story about psychology but this does not make it a psychological horror. The makers of this game fill in as many cliché horror elements as they can and it feels like canned horror much as everything else in the industry and I think this is what they wanted, to sell it.\n\nThe fact that it's third person doesn't help it either plus the main character is void of any real life human reactions to the terrors he sees and all you'll ever him say is "what the ♥♥♥♥" or "♥♥♥♥" while he runs away. The only moments it feels like the main character is scared is in his breathing, which will take you aback as he's pretty much sold as a bad ♥♥♥ in cut scenes and then suddenly he's breathing like a sissy in another.\n\nScary the game isn't, an interesting story it doesn't have but it really does try. I get this feeling there must've been some limitations while making this game. It is far more a horror game than Resident Evil series is, which stopped trying to scare the player. The Evil Within tries and it might actually scare some of your squeamish friends.\n\nI still recommend it\nFor sure! It's not a bad game by any stretch and has some interesting visuals. It isn't a genre reformer and I don't think it tries to be. It's a horror game for the masses that dips its' head into the jar of ideas and copies a lot from other sources and then slams together a sandwich of a game with a bit of everything. It lacks heavily in originality, story, gameplay and horror but it's all in all a very... mediocre game. Not bad, not good, just bland.","February 2, 2015","true","20.6"," 63 of 95 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","63","95","6","2"

Here are my thoughts:\n\nDifficulty: The game's difficulty is average to difficult, but never unfair (the game gives you enough resources and messing up does not mean you'll have to restart from an earlier save).\nGraphics: playing this on Ultra, I was impressed and took many pictures of some really nice things I saw in the game. The game has many high points, with very nice light and dark scenes. The only con is the "cut and paste" of some models, which break the immersion.\nSound: I've played many of this game's quieter moments with my earphone, and I was really impressed. Amazing sound design, which makes you feel like you are playing a horror movie in the game's more stealth-oriented sections.\nGameplay: RE4 with some limitations, so you cannot fight like a soldier. You can use melee, but it is not effective for killing the enemies. You get some upgrades that, when used well, really make the difference, but running and using the environment is the key to survival, as the enemies are a lot more aggressive than in other games of the genre.\nStory: Not too original, you'll feel like you are riding in a nightmare, but the pieces will make sense in time, especially if you play the DLC (I'm still playing the second DLC, but I can tell they really add meaning to the story).\nSome complaints: copied assets (as mentioned above), dying fast because of powerful enemies, action sequences are a bit overused so you lose a bit the horror vibe to get a more action-oriented feeling.\nOverall: 10/10, Essential game in any true gamer's library, especially if you enjoy survival horror games!","May 9","true","44.1"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

Is it a horror?  Is it stealth? Is it a slasher movie gone video game? Is it a shooter?  By the end of the game, I was not sure.  It's like the Frankenstein's monster of video games.\n\nTo start out, I will give praise where praise is due.  The game delivers many dark and creepy segments of game-play and rarely uses jump scares.  The sound effects are eerie, dark, ominous and nauseating at times.  They add a lot to the atmosphere of the game.  The devs also use the plot to dish out some trippy reality shifting moments that will leave you  blinking and stunned.\n\nSome of the monster designs were spooky and can make your skin crawl.   Not all of them were original, but a lot of effort did go into that part of the game, and it shows.\n\nThe balance of skills and ammo is done well, but some of the skills feel either pointless, or like they shouldn't have been upgradable skills in the first place -- Like the fact that your character can't sprint for more than TWO seconds without upgrades.\n\nThe story, like the game-play, feels pieced together from a host of other games and leaves you scratching your head at the end with some unexplained and out of place last minute scenes that are thrown at you as the game is ending.  I understand that some of the questions are answered in the DLC, but that feels like a cheap way to get people to buy the content.  The story is too convoluted to cover in the review, but the vibe that I got is that the devs wanted free range to do whatever they wanted in the game... and they do!\n\nUnfortunately, after the first hour or so of game-play, it was clear that many flaws were being hidden behind an ocean of blood and a promising start.  The way the devs use the plot to implement any crazy thought that entered their minds has me wondering if they all gathered in a room the first day, and the lead dev said "Okay people.  Here's a bucket; here's a stack of paper.  Everyone start writing chaotic and bloody ideas and put them in the bucket!  Don't you dare hold back!  I want an ocean of blood!  I want giant brains!  I want giant eyeballs!  I want gory, slasher like monster!  I want CoD moments that have no place in the mix!  I want the worst melee combat you can come up with!  I want a random driving segment that lasts three seconds!  I want floating hummers with heavy machine guns!  I want chainsaws!  I want poorly made invisible enemies that we only use for ten minutes!  I want stealth!  I want you to forget about the stealth five minutes later!" and that is how this game was born.\n\nThe characters aren't the worst I have seen in a video game, but they are a far-cry from believable.  The main character is an emotionless meat sack that brushes off the mental stress of human meat-lockers and fountains of blood like it's just another day at work.  The character interactions are mostly dull and don't do a whole lot for the game accept keep it moving.  There are some serious face slapping one-liners in this game.\n\nThe part that made this game so hard for me to enjoy is the fact that evey time I thought "this might be cool!" the game ruins it with clunky game-play, bad pacing, poor character development, and just outright sloppiness by the devs that made some segments unnecessarily frustrating.\n\nThe game is worth s squirt when its on a solid sale.  Otherwise, I would recommend looking elsewhere.   There are  better horror games on the market; there are better 3rd person shooters; there are better stealth rpgs.  This game wants to be all of them, but fails on all three levels in the end.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=524578178","September 30, 2015","false","30.7"," 196 of 332 people (59%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","59","196","332","28","12"

First off, most will be familiar with the black bar and 30 fps lock issue.  These can be solved with a few console commands provided by Bethesda.  However; even with these fixes the FOV is abysmal. Trying to aim with your weapon will make the screen zoom in almost comically far to where you can't even see your weapon.  Trying to turn your character to the left or right feels like I am trying to back a semi-truck into a parking space at Best Buy on black Friday. Combine this with horrendous screen tearing and minimal set of graphics options and you get a game that wants to be great but is hampered by technical issues.  The sad thing is, if they had allowed a full set of graphic adjustment options I feel like this could have been a GOTY contender. Obligatory pro and con list below:\n\n\nPros:\n\n+Great graphics, especially with rain and particle effects\n+RPG like elements which I enjoy\n+Silent Hill esque atmosphere\n+Decent story so far\n\nCons:\n\n-Character movement is terrible.  They clearly modeled the game after RE4 yet a game that is 10 years old handles movement much better than this game\n-The FOV is inexcusable.  I get having a tight camera to make a tense feeling but this is so bad that if you are trying to fire your weapon at an enemy up close the camera doesn't know what to do and you end up dying as you can't see a damn thing\n-Complete lack of graphical adjustment options\n-Poor performance even on a higher end system\n\nI really hope they patch this game.  As it stands right now, this game is nothing but squandered potential.\n","October 14, 2014","false","3.3"," 216 of 371 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","216","371","0","3"

While there were points that I did enjoy this game, I can't recommend it for the following reasons.\n\n1.	The control mechanics were subpar.  I understand the intent behind the mechanics was to instill a feeling of fear and anxiety, the execution of those controls really instilled more of a feeling of frustration.  There were several points in the game where my projectile (be it bullet or crossbow bolt) appeared to hit the mark dead on, but caused no damage.\nIn addition to the shoddy aiming mechanics, the stealth component of the game was extremely hit or miss.  There were points at which an enemy would look at you dead on and not see you, but then other times when you were completely hidden the enemy would become alerted.\n\nAlso there were platform components of the game that were extremely frustrating as the fixed camera angle made it almost impossible to avoid the various trip wires and enemies in some areas.\n\n2.	The second and most frustrating component of the game was the inconsistent difficulty.  In some cases you are not meant to defeat the boss but rather evade it.  But in other cases you are meant to defeat the boss.  This inconsistency lead to some very frustrating checkpoints in the game.  Also the boss battles seemed (in some cases) frustratingly difficult compared to the difficulty of the game overall.\n\n3.	Finally the story was just okay.  There were no “HOLY CRAP THAT WAS SCARY” moments nor were there any parts of the game that were particularly tense.  With a pedigree like Shinji Mikami I did expect more.\n\nSo if this is on a particularly good sale I would not discourage picking it up, but be aware of the fact you are in for about 8 hours of fairly mediocre game play with about 4 hours of frustration.\n","December 13, 2014","false","24.5"," 177 of 302 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","177","302","7","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevampyri/recommended/268050/","thevampyri","Vampyri","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thevampyri/","336 products in account","Greetings!  Welcome to my review of The Evil Within.   I don't generally post reviews before completing a game, but if you're anything like me you enjoy reading what other intelligent gamers like yourself have to say about something before plunking down that AAA cash.  Grab a drink and snack, we have some ground to cover.\n\nI noticed while reading through initial reviews marked "most helpful" that all of the negative reviews seem to discuss a couple of similar points, so we'll start there.  The aspect ratio, or should I say THE ASPECT RATIO!!!!11  seems to fuel the majority of these negative feelings.  TEW utilizes a 2:35:1 cinematic aspect ratio.  I didn't find it to be an issue at all, but I do believe that the size of your screen and your relative distance from it could play a part in your personal enjoyment of the game.  On a larger screen or a small screen right in front of you it creates a mild sense of claustrophobia and panic, even in outdoor areas.  Given that the aspect ratio was discussed at length multiple times on a variety of forums before the game was released, I didn't feel at all surprised by it.  Furthermore, as everyone currently playing the game had access to the same information before release, negative reviews based on the aspect ratio should be taken with a grain of salt.  The "black bars" efffect isn't something that everyone will like or appreciate, but ignorance is never a good reason for a negative opinion.\n\nNot to be outdone by aspect ratio negativity, that old favorite frame rate rears it's head in a multitude of reviews as well.  Out of the box, TEW is locked to 30fps.  It runs smoothly at 30fps and feels like you're watching a horror movie from the 80s.  The preivews and interviews I read leading up to release did not mention that it would be set to 30fps in the PC version specifically, so I can understand the frustration with the frame rate a bit more than the aspect ratio.  I would suggest playing the game initially as presented, but Bethesda has already posted a concise guide on how to alter the frame rate and the aspect ratio via the console if you so choose:\n\nhttp://forums.bethsoft.com/topic/1508646-debug-console-commands/\n\nAll standard disclaimers apply to utilizing the console.  It may impact your playing experience negatively as it is not a officially supported way to play the game.  That being said, Bethesda does plan to fix glitches associated with playing the game at 60fps in the future.\n\nLet's now move on to "optimization".  The phrases "poorly optimized" and "well optimized" are thrown around so much they mean very little.  Without an explanation all I hear is "it doesn't run well on my computer" or "it runs well on my computer".  These opinions are important as they give a statistical point of comparision.  It does need to be pointed out however, that based on how the information is presented to you the source(s) may have no idea what they're talking about.  TEW runs well on a variety of systems.  I've had the opportunity to test it on three different computers and with some setting changes it ran at a steady 30fps on all three.   I consider the game to be well optimized not because it runs well, but because it can be adjusted and runs well on very different computers.  I did adjust the frame rate to 60fps on a PC utilizing an Nvidia 800 series card and other than some minor animation and pop up issues experienced no problems at all despite it being currently unsupported.  Keep in mind you will need a powerful rig to "max" the settings and run the game at higher than 30fps.  This should go without saying, but I will say it anyway: Update your video card drivers BEFORE you start playing the game.  If you are going to be playing TEW on a laptop with an Nvidia card and Nvidia Optimus, create a new profile for the game in the nividia control panel BEFORE you start playing.  This will eliminate the most common startup issues with TEW.\n\nEveryone still with me?  Good.  If anyone would like more detailed information on the computers TEW was tested on and the settings used to achieve the test results, please drop me a line.\n\nOkay, on to the fun stuff.  TEW is a brutal but loving tribute to a survival horror era gone by.  If it was released in 2004 instead of 2014 I believe it would have been a game of the year nominee.  It looks alot like a Silent Hill game and plays like a Resident Evil 4/The Last Of Us greatest hits mash-up.  If you long for the PS2 era of survival horror games this game was made for you.  The environments are a sight to behold, disturbing and beautiful in equal measure.  The gore level is intense without being ridiculous.  The enemies you face are detailed and terrifying.  The sound effects and score set the tone very well.  The controls are tight and feel very natural with a controller.  The only thing that pulled me out of the experience was the other human characters that you interact with on occasion.  The textures and voices for these characters really don't fit with the look and feel of the rest of the game, and the effect is jarring.  This was most noticable to me in the opening cut scene conversation.  The feeling of hit and miss textures and voice acting is a fleeting one though, you will spend most of your time killing or being killed by some of the most detailed nightmares in gaming.\n\nTo answer what is in my opinion the most important question about any game, TEW is a great deal of fun to play.  The scare tactics used aren't original, but they are varied and used to great effect throughout.  If you enjoy horror games The Evil Within is absolutely a must play.  9/10\n\nEDIT: It has been brought to my attention that although the aspect ratio is said to be 2:35:1 it actually is not.  Al informed me of this (Thank you Al!) and I have verified it.  The game is locked to 16:9 with letterboxing (or pillarboxing if you prefer) when played on a 21:9 monitor.","October 14, 2014","true","28.2"," 252 of 441 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","252","441","0","7"

The aspect ratio is way off and to put matters worse my FPS still dips even with the 30FPS lock. What I find really funny is even if I try to unlock the FPS its still staying around 30 FPS AND still dips below that! That should not be possible with a Radeon R9 290X, I can run Crysis 3 on average of 80FPS and that puts The Evil Within graphics to shame.\n\n\nAdded Note: This is strictly a performance review, I figured we would all be smart enough to realise that but I guess only some caught on. That out of the way after more testing it would appear my FPS was struggling only when I'm outside but as soon as I went indoors everything was where it should be, about 80-100FPS and I'm ok with that. I notice though my game would randomly lock up for a few seconds and everything would be fine after until it locked up again but it is a new game and that can be expected to happen on release.\n\nNow just to make those who wanted more than just a performance review happy, I did play through chapter 1 with the recommended aspect ratio and it did seem like I was watching and playing a more interactive movie approach, which was interesting. However atleast through chapter 1, I didn't feel like I was getting immersed into the story of the game, maybe because I didn't feel like I had any full control on my movement. The story doesn't really make since, atleast not right now in the early game but so far it feels like I'm watching a cheesy horror flick where one minute I'm injured but the next scene I'm fine?\n\nAfter reading through some comments and gave more thought to it, I recommend to tread carefully with purchasing this game. If steam had a third recommendation option I would have chose that one but alas they don't so I'm still sticking with not recommending. Since I've only played through the first chapter I have regained some hope for this game and hoping the story starts to make more sense and maybe even become immersive.

This one forgot everything that was good but multiplied everything that was bad. Stealth is almost non-existent, you  can pass a few moments, but for the most part (I blame the camera) it's clunky and unresponsive. What about shooting parts? Of course they send a horde from Serious Sam at you, except that you either have no ammo, your weapons are too weak or you're bleeding to death. Oh and shooting is horrible, especially since the bullets don't come out of the weapon, but from the crosshair (you know, mafira 2 and some other games used this system too). So if you are on low hp and an enemy is point-blank to you, unless you have a shotgun or the game suddenly goes to 60 fps for you you are dead.\n\nIf you want to play this game, just go and get Resident evil 4 HD here on steam http://store.steampowered.com/app/254700/\n\nOh and just in case if somebody thinks that this game is beautiful and long and stuff and I didn't even finish it: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=326644291\n\nEdit: Ironically, the black borders/60 fps official fix actually made game even worse. Why? Because you can see that the game was supposed to run with black borders for the *authentic* experience. Without them it feels even worse. 60 fps is ok, but again, it's possible to complete it with 30 fps, so no big deal.\n\nReview stays the same","October 14, 2014","false","12.8"," 230 of 403 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","230","403","0","9"

This is a great game and as a longtime Resident Evil fan I really appreciate Shinji Mikamis The Evil Within as he pays a lot of homage not only to the Resident Evil series but also to a lot of cult horror movies like Evil Dead, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or The Thing.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to the one of Resident Evil 4 and you will feel right at home when you are familiar with that game. This is by far not an easy game and I believe a lot of people will struggle with some chapters on higher difficulties, nevertheless if you are a true survival horror fan or Resident Evil fan you probably should give this title a try.\n\nBe aware that the PC version has some high system requirements and that you will need a decent quad core CPU and a decent 2-4 GB V-Ram graphics card to fully enjoy the PC version. It had some severe crashes on launch but they were removed with a recent patch.\n\nThis game is not for everyone but personally its up there as game of the year 2014 at least in my humble opinion.","December 28, 2014","true","122.6"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/268050/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","The Evil Within is an atmospheric horror survival game by Shinji Mikami the creator of Resident Evil series.The game is a survival/horror that has some gore filled disturbing moments and a nostalgic feel of the old school horror genre.\n\nUpdated The Letterbox issue and 30 fps issue and is recently patched up  by Bethesda as in TODAY!, Therefore the statement about it at all is no longer viable so I deleted it from this review write up, the game started off with something that should had been a toggable option in the menu that had people going ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ over something so small and voting negatives. I am so happy I did a review about the game BASED on the game itself instead of bashing that issue. This review as usual is and always will be focused on and about  THE GAME, good job Bethesda for showing them.\nSebastian Costellanos who is on his way to investigate a mass murder at the hospital with his partners Julie and Kidman. Upon arrival is a man sitting on the floor spouting its impossible when suddenly a hooded figure attacks Sebastian,  and he finds himself  upside down to see a man carving humans up like pigs at a shop and thus begins the game story.\nLiterally the story is pretty insane, There will be moments where the mind is in a state of chaos. Is this game about a supernatural horror? some kind of new virus? Is it psychological? Wtf is going on? The main character himself will be confused but as time comes along, Putting, the text newspaper clues found throughout the game and story progression  together is when the the pieces start falling together, which turns out to be quite decent.\n\nThe game graphics are quite good and surprisingly atmospheric. The fogs, the lighting, and the way the aesthetic is laid out across every map, The blowing curtains and drapes, the littered corpses, and crumbling buildings are just some of the example of what makes this game immersive. Most of the maps in this game are arena sized areas with set  path with corridors and unlike other horror games you cannot repeatedly come back so make sure you search the area thoroughly before progressing.  Players can choose to divert their attention to search for keys or map pieces, There are times when the graphics get a bit muddy or don't make sense (Wine bottle tossed on the player makes it look like strawberry jam on him).\n\nThe voice acting in this game is decent though some are not as impressive they are, however, passable. The sounds heard from weapons, monsters and the aesthetic themselves are really nicely done and majority of the time, there isn't much music in the game except the ones that come from save points but that's the beauty of it. The silence is what makes it scary when players aren't sure what exactly is going to expect.\n\nThe game play of the game plays much like resident evil 4( of course its made by the guy who created the game). There is a stealth game play mechanic that allows players to kill the enemy quietly or with guns and  damage thier body parts  such as the head to take them down, stomping on them or and use matches to prevent them from back up. Matches can also prevent future corpses. There are also melee weapons in the game but they are one time use items such as the torch or axe. Though it is a shame that You cannot drag bodies into fire.\n\nThe game Ai is pretty stupid at times and act much like resident evil zombies if anything but can also be argued that its because they're undead. Overall they function well when they are working together to kill the player, and the bigger enemies will have no mercy. The boss fights in this game are hard and will require players to conserve ammo to fight against. Running is an option but there are times when that option is completely out of the question. The puzzles in this game is sub par at best and isn't something to make people think too hard on.\n\nSebastion is always armed with a lantern as a source of light, as for the weapons in the game included are pistols, shotguns, sniper rifle, grenades, Magnum, and of course the agony bow which uses a different variety of arrows such as poison, ice, explosive fire,   and can be used as traps. There is seven total It is the all in one crossbow weapons. Throughout the game players will encounter traps that can be disarmed by either holding space or timing a needle to hit a green mark to materials and create the agony bow ammunition. After completing the game players get a rocket launcher and machine gun.\n\nIn the beginning of the game when players are weak and have no ammo, there isn't many choices except to stealth,hide, distract enemies, or kill them in one shot using torches and axes. Melee is probabaly not a good choice because enemies will grab on to the player if given the chance and can deal  a hefty amount of damage. The  later stages of the game will have less if not any hiding at all.\n\nThe health stats, stamina,  weapons damage, crits, accuracy,  and even ammo amount is part of a stats system or rpg element  that players have to upgrade in order to improve their overall character performance. This gives the player options and variety in what they want to be their greatest strength and never will he be more overpowered than the enemy. Upgrading requires green gel to do so in certain amounts.\n\nThe camera rest behind the player shoulder that can zoom in on strange ways at times and can be a nuisance to some.\nSmashable objects such as pot and boxes, hidden compartments are how players find ammo in the game, along with  secret keys to open locks in the safe haven ward to obtain extra goodies to aid.  There will be plenty of things lying around to find yet they are limited so using them wisely is the key to survival. There will be times when not being conservative will get you killed.\n\nThe controls are clunky at times and reminded me of an old school resident evil and took a bit of time to get used to Of course once one gets to use to it, everything will be a bit more smooth and fits in. The mouse acceleration during the screen needs to be patched, and hopefully we'll see one but aside from that the game interface is clean. Players can set weapons/items it to 4 keys at a time otherwise there will be a radial menu which can be pulled up and slows down time in the game  for swap outs.\nThe map spans 15 chapters and takes about close to an hour each to complete, sometimes more if one chooses to look and explore everything.  Game time can range between 13-15 hours to complete the game\n\nThere is no multiplayer players are able to replay the game in this hardest difficulties Nightmare and Akumu whereas akumu is one shot death mode.\n\nMy Opinion? Check the video below, typed out way too long and over the limit for steam I had  fun with the game, and I know there will be a handful of people who will enjoy this game also from their own perspective. All negatives aside this was a decently made game that was immersive, atmospheric, gore filled horror and if anything more horror action survival than a run aroundhide type of horror game. One scariness is different from another and the constant change of gameplay every chapter keeps the game from being stale.\n\n\nPros\n+ atmospheric\n+ Environment  Aesthetics, and enemies\n+ The gameplay, there is something new every chapter and never overused\n+ This game is hard, especially the boss battles\n+ Bloody, gorey, and scary/tense in ways\n+ They Patched the letterbox and 60 fps into option go BATHESDA !\nCons\n- Easy puzzles\n- muddy textures for certain things\n- Enemy stuck at wierd places\n\n(Not really a con)\n- No multiplayer\n\nVideo Reviewhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbwnPMJbDlo&list=PL6GtmLrh3QgEyyl6_Jn08_pqwQFi9E3Vp\n\nZombie Bowl Akumu Modehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zjRZnu43q80&feature=youtu.be\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/strmgrp#curation\nJoin the Gamer Race","December 24, 2014","true","23.7"," 103 of 175 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","103","175","3","56"

Solo nightime only playthrough with headphones on.\nMax settings with fxaa, unlocked framerate (via unlocked console at 1st, via .ini edit later due to console unlock messing with achievements), black bars intact to preserve intended presentation.\n\nPros\n\n1) Atmospheric and diverse levels with map design that rewards exploration.\n\n2) Combat system similar to RE4 with a fully "modern camera" and nerfed melee. The coup-de-grace move\nin this game is burning downed enemies that requires matchsticks to perform. Burn area has a small aoe\nso if any enemies are very close to the downed foe they will catch on fire as well. While there is no roll or dodge the sprint mechanic is as effective and once fully upgraded it allows you to easily manoeuvre arround most enemy types, repositioning between attacks, baiting foes into attacking you, forming bee-lines and toying with the ai. Guns feel good even at stock levels even though some of them feel a bit overnerfed at vanilla as a means to add to the intensity (vanilla pistol shoots outside of reticle at 5m or less sometimes even when sitting still) . Gun reloads are RE4 levels of sexy.\n\n3) Resources are limited yet you will always have what you need at your disposal. The game encourages both exploration and carefull observation of your surroundings. Using environmental traps and shooting enemies at certain body parts so that they either lose their balance and end up dying from environmental hazards or become susceptible to burning is pretty much mandatory.\n\n4) Boss encounters are well orchestraded and usually pit you against an intimidating enemy in a pretty small space and require constant manoeuvres in close encounters until you either figure out some sort of environmental puzzle, or manage to down your foe with your arsenal.\n\n5) The game looks good. Nothing jaw-dropping but it absolutely manages to capture the feel and look of the environments.Textures look organic and nothing feels out of place. There are certain scenes that are incredibly moody and brooding.\n\n6) Key bosses are tied nicely into the game's story with their backgrounds explaining their vulnerabilities and appearance.\n\n7) Replayable. The game has a NG+ mode, 2 harder unlockable difficulties, 2 types of collectibles, unlockable weapons that are rewarded once finishing the game and an upgrade system that requires more than one playthrough to max out everything. Also the achievement list is pretty great encouraging you to do various playthroughs (no upgrades, 1 hit kill mode, etc).\n\n8) Stealth mechanic adds flexibility to how you can approach many encounters.\n\n\nCons\n\n1) Cringeworthy voice over performances. Not as bad as "Barry" and "Jill Sandwitch" but close. Most of the time vo prevented me from taking any of the characters seriously and the dialogue was comically bad at times. Think a couple notches better than Godfrey Ho's Ninja films. Cheezy vo is great given the right context. In a game that appears serious and menacing however, it detracts from the atmosphere and breaks immersion making the player feel at ease with what would've otherwise been an incredibly unpleasant situation.\n\n2) The game has almost zero build-up. Even though earlier chapters are slower paced and require a more stealthy approach since you don't have many weapons or upgrades, it still does nothing with character progression. Even if you take your time and read personal notes in order to get a better grasp at understanding who your character is what his background is and what his motives are, what you see on screen is just a guy with a gun. Not likeable or unlikeable, no personality traits or quirks just plain and uninteresting. There is no display of emotion and even when events that are beyond reason occur, the character seems completely disconected from what's going on arround him even if the answer is pretty easy to guess.\nThe game flows well and the action is pretty much non-stop, however there is no real incentive to push forward. Since character performances are wooden and all characters felt like stock material it's really hard to feel anything for anyone. Even the player death segments, while very gory, failed to evoke any emotional response. In that regard 2013's Tomb Raider, a game which had some horror undertones but was very far away from being labeled as horror, had death segments which felt way more gruesome and disturbing.\n\n3) Unconvincing bad guy. As with every other character in the game the archvillain didn't make me feel anything. His origins and build up as a character are explained in detail, in contrast to those of the protagonist yet i didn't  feel either compassion or hate for him, nor was i intimidated by him. In a way he was just a regular villain (but a very fun bossfight) with a Tetsuo-Shima level of power.\n\n4) No sense of dread and spine-tingling tension. While the game has well crafted intense encounters it didn't deliver that heart-pounding borderline paranoia inducing experience that i was looking for.\nThe main culprit for this is the disconnection from the characters. The enemy designs while really well made looked familiar and their behaviour patterns were clear and very predictable, demoting what would've otherwise been a terrifying moment to a simple action segment.\n\n5) Uninvolving story. I am certainly not one for pulling plot twists out of the blue for the sake of having a plot twist and i appreciate it when a game or a film has a predictable but well crafted story even if that is as simple as 1-2-3. The story in this however was uninvolving and that is truly a shame as there are elements within it that could've been emphasized upon adding emotion and attempting to immerse the player in the protagonist's struggle. The plot as is, felt like just an excuse for the action to take place.\n\n\nNeutral\n\n1) Visually visceral yet not frightening. The game's terror is the equivalent of SAW,House of 1000 corpses, Texas chainsaw massacre, etc.The game delivers gore with the subtlety of a Cannibal Corpse album so if films with disfigured bad guys, tons of gore, decayed, rotten environments and flesh sculpture get you then this will get you as well. If you are familiar with that kind of horror and it's something that you enjoy being exposed to then you'll feel right at home. If you seek for a deeper, more psychological and disturbed kind of terror however, then i'm afraid this won't do it for you.\n\n2) Game feels like a horror anthology with a mix of bosses that either appeared in a RE game before in some form or are very conceptually familiar in modern horror.\n\nAll in all if you want a horror-themed action game with tight resource management, active/manual/engaging combat system that encourages observation and experimentation and diverse, atmospheric levels that reward exploration and allow you to approach encounters in either stealth or head-on or a combination of these two, then you'll have a blast with this title.\n\nIf you are looking for a game that will make you feel uneasy, terrified, out of breath and will put you at the edge of your seat and if gore horror does nothing for you then you'd better look elsewhere.","October 16, 2014","true","42.1"," 102 of 175 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","102","175","0","3"

This is simple, I should not have to enter console commands to get the game running in a correct resolution. Secondly, I have an ultra wide monitor with native 21:9 aspect ratio. So you think would look great, and fit, but in reality, not only are there the black bars on the top and bottom, but also on the sides. That is unacceptable. I read reviews ahead of time, I spend my money wisely. I buy a lot of games from steam. But never been so disappointed.yes, enter console commands, but really, every time.....some of us work for a living, and don't care to recode when I have 5 minutes to play. And a game that was built for 21:9 aspect ratio, can't even display correctly on a 21:9 monitor. Explain that. And yes, my review was short and to the point, didn't realize you needed it spoon fed to you. Unfortunately, I've tried to complain to steam, but they don't even have the game listed as an option to submit a ticket?? So, bottom line, game isn't worth a cent.\n\n\nThis is perfect example of a crap port, where no effort was put forth to ensure PC gamers have acceptable ability to conform to their own PC.\n\nBtw, borderlands pre sequel? Worked like a champ in 21:9 all on its own. That's 2560 x 1080 for you who don't know. Renders perfectly. No commands, or special third party programs necessary. Works perfect out the box, figuratively.\n\nWhy should I expect anything different here? Same amount of money.

Having said that, the game is amazing. Graphically, it's beautiful, and the music is quite good. Gameplay is great, and a lot like a souped up RE4, but that's not a bad thing, at least to me. Another complaint I hear is that the story isn't very good, but man oh man, the story is fantastic! It's explained through the game, and by use of collectables found through-out the game. Most of it is explained, except for the things which will be covered in the DLC, but you have to pay attention to all the dialogue if you want to know what's going on. Great control, great music, great graphics, and one of the few games on Steam that I've felt a desire to complete wholly. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes survival horror, RPG style stories, and the RE series. Runner up to my game of the year, 2014.\n\nEdit: The Assignment DLC. Fantastic. I loved how the main focus was stealth, and sneakiness. It really gave the DLC a creepier feel to it. Some of those shadow puzzles were difficult for me as my eyes are awful, but I got past them with time. I didn't have high hopes for this as I wasn't too keen on Kidman, but it was a cool experience to play as her. The Kurayami mode was incredibly frustrating for me, as I stated before my eyes are awful as it is. I died so much on this, but that was to be expected. It was a great challenge, and though I didn't really enjoy Kurayami mode, it was different, and I can appreciate that. Took me about 10 hours to complete all the achievements, and I had a fun time for the most part. I really enjoyed seeing things that were happening at the same time the main game was happening, and also where certain areas of the world came from as they were established as not from the main characters minds. It was definitely worth the time, and, in my opinion, was a fantastic DLC.\n\nEdit: The Consequence DLC. Quite great, though not as good as the first one, imo. The main focus was still stealth, but there were some gun parts thrown in, and I can see why. No where near as many puzzles, though the little collectable hints were a little tricky to find at times. Kurayami mode was even more aggravating this time, but I didn't die nearly as many times as I did on it in the first DLC. Took me about eight hours this time to finish the achievements, but it was pretty fun. There were some great achievements this time too. Well worth getting.\n\nEdit: The Executioner DLC: By far it's the worst yet. It offers a little story, but is basically a boss rush mode that you end up having to grind for coins to upgrade your weapons, and skills. The maps are boring, and unimaginative, and the waves of mobs are boring as well. You'd think playing as the Keeper would be great, but instead it's... yep boring. It takes less than an hour to get through once, a few new things open, about the same time to get through it again. After that... what's the point? Nothing changes, it remains the same, and it's not fun at all. I expected more out of the final DLC, but it's a disappointment, and instead. What a waste.","November 26, 2014","true","46.9"," 70 of 119 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","70","119","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/recommended/268050/","PrimalHunter_779","PrimalHunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimalHunter_779/","383 products in account","The Evil Within is a new original survival horror game, developed by the minds behind the original Resident Evil games and the genius of Shinji Mikami. The game seeks to provide players with an 'old school' survival horror game; complete with chills, scarce ammunition and challenging enemy encounters. I'm pretty happy to say I really enjoyed this game despite a few missteps.\nThe story has the player controlling a detective named Sebastian Castellanos; Sebastian and his team are called in to Beacon Mental Hospital to investigate the scene of a gruesome mass murder, and from then on, a whole lot of horrific supernatural shenanigans occurs. It's worth noting that the story is pretty confusing and was certainly not easy to follow; the characters are also somewhat dull, so if you play this game, I wouldn't really advise doing so for the narrative.\nGameplay is the real heart and soul of The Evil Within, and oh my, what great gameplay it is! The game handles like a fresher version of Resident Evil 4 in nearly every way; third-person camera angle with similar over the shoulder aiming. Ammo is incredibly scarce, and just like in Resident Evil 4, the zombie-like enemies will amble and shuffle towards you while you attempt to pull off a frantic headshot. There are a few boss fights thrown in throughout the game, all of which were stressful and challenging. There are also a few neat mechanics; for example, the upgrade system has Sebastian collecting vials of green gel, which can be used back at the hospital ward to upgrade his various skills and attributes. Additionally, the player can also burn the corpses of downed enemies in order to ensure that they don't rise from the grave as well as providing you with valulable resources. Just like in Resident Evil 4, you'll navigate mansions, villages, as well as the modern day city, hospital wards and abandoned facilities. Due to the supernatural nature of the game, you'll be thrown from one area to the next without context, which I didn't really mind since I was mainly in this game for the intense gameplay. I wouldn't say this game was 'terrifying', however I will say that the enemy encounters were very stressful and the game really doesn't skimp out on gore and incredibly intense enemy encounters. The Evil Within makes a nice compromise between horror and action, with only occassional dips into ridiculousness. In short; this is a very similar experience to Resident Evil 4 with a whole lot of refinements. If you liked that, you'll love The Evil Within.\nTechnically, the game succeeds both in audio and visuals. Ambient sound effects are very creepy, and set you on edge before enemy encounters, along with the various 'gross' sound effects that make the gore so visceral. The graphics aren't exactly groundbreaking, but they look nice enough. There's many detailed environments to be found here, and the lighting effects are also quite nice.\nMy only other real gripe with this game apart from the mediocre narrative is the PC optimisation; this game runs quite badly on most systems, even after the multiple patches. The devs were kind enough to remove the black bars and the 30 FPS cap, which was a very welcome addition.\nIn conclusion, The Evil Within is an excellent survival horror experience that will please any super fans of the older Resident Evil games. The folks over at Tango and Bethesda have managed to craft an intense and unique horror experience despite missteps with the story and PC optimisation. Highly recommended.","January 21, 2015","true","32.1"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","4"

I am playing the digital pc version and I don't know if it's the different systems or what but I found very little as far as pop in and framerate drops. The only time I encountered them is a couple of seconds when the game autosaves and other than that the game has ran flawless for me. Also while it is in the minor opinion from what i seen how can anyone say this game is not scary or at have a very tense, heart pounding atmosphere? I may not have just out of my seat screaming scared or anything but this is definitely a tense game. I don't know how many times I just said to myself "What the heck?" and other phases along those lines.\n\nShinji and his team did an excellent job at designing the environments and atmosphere of the game as far as what I have played so far. Now what is it with some saying that the game plays like it's 2005 like it's a bad thing? I have seen lots on the internet that enjoy that especially me. To be honest why would anyone expect different? We all saw the game play since it was announced. I happen to like the RE4 style mixed with the last of us and dead space. To me it was clear that it was not going to be anything revolutionary.\n\nNow I have enjoyed the pacing so far and everything about it but there are a couple minor things that keep me from giving the game a 10. First the story I guess you can say is intriguing but feels kinda dull or lacking so to speak, the characters are alright but don't expect a masterpiece of story telling. Also while the controls work great and the balances ammo system that keeps you from blasting through everything is well implemented in my opinion there are a few parts I feel that seem cheap and unfair. For example there is once part where you have to press one of two buttons, one advances you through the puzzle the other is an instant death, I have ran into few spots like that but they are kinda annoying.\n\nThe controls are great except sometimes if I am facing a horde the response to buttons feel late and you get a cheap hit from the enemy it's rare but it gets annoying when it happens. Oh and as far as enemy design just look at Shinji's past work and if you like it then you will love the designs in the evil within. Also I'm not one to harp on graphics but I have to admit that they can look a bit dated and there are some muddy textures, they don't really bother me considering it was a 4 year developement and all but I think I have to mention that. To be honest I think this game is great and I am glad I followed my gut and bought it. I can't say I like it more than the older Residents or RE4 but I do feel it is better than RE5 or 6. As for whether people should get this or not  i will have to say go for it and get it on sale.\n\nOverall: It's a great game and you should pick it up.","November 30, 2014","true","43.2"," 89 of 156 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","89","156","0","5"

WHy? - Capcom requested due to the shooters at the time selling exceptionally well, to create a game that could attract to both audiences. Luckily he succeeded and created a classic title. What he had worked on for quite awhile prior, the original Viewable and /playable/ demo of Resident Evil 4 is very much like being inside of Ruvik's family mansion.\n\nIn some rooms (Near exact table set up with a deer head on the same wall across a fireplace in both game's rooms; very well could be one of his easter eggs but it continues) the paintings on the wall near the same themes and imagery; scenes of "Mind F'ing" style of horror rather than pure horror is displayed in a near 70/30 fashion with 70% seeming to be that Pyschological horror that could have changed the entire Resident Evil franchises Story Line for the better for even the recent mediocre to downright awful titles that continue down the "Resident Gears of Duty: Michael Bay Directors Cut"\n- In the E3 Demo for the Original RE4 aside from the most claustrophopic feeling areas that the series had ever attempted, something very much rekindled in The Evil Within's late 70's early 80's Horror film stylism. A scene had Leon walk into a room where a blue pulsing light similiar to how its used in The Evil Within illuminated after walking past endless Baby Dolls with cracks in their heads / smashed faces and parts - Obviously they come alive in a rather delightful fashion; the kind of scare / "What the hell is going on here... is this really happening?" vibe that The Evil Within also has.\n\n-Mikami seems to have designed Ruvik after the highlight of this e3 Build of RE4; "Hook Man" as the community calls him (or Chain Man) - Mikami just be fond of the Capcom writers for Megaman and the Boss Names from the various MM games -laughs- ; BACK ON TOPIC ; We know that ruvik cannot be killed in this the game, as his ghostly figure will stalk you at every wrong moment possible, and hiding is the only way to berid of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. To similiar jumping sound effect and blue illuminated light, "Hook Man" is displayed after you pass a painting of a man holding a chain with a hook on the end; in a Ghostly type figure he comes out of the painting to menacing music, and begins to just walk towards you.\n\n-Bullets = he doesn't flinch; then He begins the very "Laura Strafe Speed Teleport with Ruvik's Choppy Forward Teleport in combination. It seems in this  Demo that supplies had been more scarce than prior REs. it seemed to emphasize that this fight was a fight or flight option; and it took in the demo basically every button seemingly unnaffecting the enemy; until eventual leaning over before re-engaging as if he was in need to catch some air; then finally - You take him out.\n\n- Then despite the changes that Shinji Mikami needed to make from the higher ups, he used all of what he had built on and changed everything except the character; and fine tuned the Third Person shooting style for the title which in the e3 original build was able to be over the shoulder aimed or RE1-3/Code Veronica etc style. He took away the pyscological horror he very much wanted to use, took away the mansion seen in RE4 demo and he made at the time what was regarded as cross-genre "Must Play"- Gamecube's now had the most critically acclaimed game released at that point in the cycle GOTY awards and spawned hundreds of Clones esp. Shooter titles. Seen as "next gen Tech LEAP", and turned RE into a must purchase franchise to all game fans in general - An equal balance of Horror and Headshot. Shinji Mikami directed (He chose directors for 2 3 Code Veronica DmC) influence and innovation for Survival Horror ended when he left his Directors Chair and Left Capcom. Note Japanese perception seeing "Directed by Shinji Mikami" as the either Above text in rather large display or centered (in promo's / posters / the games) it means the Japanese consumers know they are buying a title that was created by the visionary they admire.\n\nWell "Pyscho Break" as it's called in Japan  launched with custom Playstation 4's nearly any Japanese Gamer with awareness or interest in the title due to just how big the MIKAMI name is in the director role - The custom console sold out very quickly and resulted in the fastest spike of PS4 sales and for the largest quanitity in Japan. was met with very exceptional critical acclaim along with near flawless fandom from the fans  "BioBreak" / PyschoHazard" by internet posters (google translated) raving & most topics had many people "Excited for the American players to play love it" - Luckily for the most part that ended up true; although some reviewers literally cannot comprehend the ability to find important story elements in the audiologs / newspapers/detective journals that are essential for understanding the plot;  reviewers in the USstated that it either had a Weak Story or Ending Japanese fans and Critics disagree with;  I HIGHLY disagree with; People seem to think of it as an Inception ending when it's not the case at all.\n---- The Ending is a resolution to all of the fascinating and mind bending curveballs being thrown all game, and concludes in such an unexpected way (in various areas aside from what is being /emphasized as the ending/ that it ties all the games narrative and lack of narrative together to make perfect sense in an extremely compelling way that would be an instant classic thriller / horror film ending that is still discussed heavily in Asian social media networks showing just how much love and respect the game receives and how GLORIOUS it honestly was from start to finish.\n\n- Now if you KNOW me you know that JOHN CARMACK is one of my heroes. I find id Tech 5 to have been a leap in the future that arrived too early. id tech 1-5 have all been brilliant; Carmack's id tech 4 created a new way lights and shadows displayed that was named after Carmack for creating the algorthm, Doom 3 (tech 4) had amazing lighting and shadows, The Evil Within's use of id Tech 5 finds the best use of light and shadow in any game yet. Mikami and his artists utilize id tech 5's ability to give artists full control over every square pixel to maximum effect. It's gorgeous, stylistically unique, vast and various.\n- Everything Mikami is here and evolved, you mix in ideas from BioShock, ShooterRPG Hybrids, Amnesia, Resident Evil, Silent Hill and slap a whole lot of new ideas together with a complex and amazing story... you get The Evil Within. A game I could not put down during my 23 hour first playthrough and 117 deaths. A game I am playing in New Game + and Also Nightmare to unlock Akumu mode, a masterpiece of the genre.\n\nAlien for example is a overlong Survival Simulator, Although some players proclaimed it a masterful work.\nThe Evil Within is the perfect Survival Horror title and can be a game that keeps that definition from a genre Mikami created and reinvented and now perfected with what is easily visible as "THE GAME HE ALWAYS WANTED TO CREATE". And It's bloody beautiful in every way.\n\nXI Geforce eSports - Wind Nvidia 3D\n10/10\nMust Purchase Seal of Approval at Retail Price.","November 6, 2014","true","42.5"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","26","40","0","3"

Does this game live up to his legacy,\nor will this be a game soon forgotten?\n\n---ABOUT---\n\nYou play as veteran police detective Sebastian Castellanos.\nWe've been given the task of investigating the scene of a\ngruesome mass murder at Beacon Mental Hospital.\n\nYou arrive together with Detective Julie Kidman and your\npartner Joseph Oda.\n\nYou soon figure out that, besides the gruesome mass murder,\nnot everything is as it should be.\n\n---REVIEW---\n\nNow this game has gotten a lot of love and hate.\nThis is my opinion, as non-biased as I can get it.\n\nWhen it comes to the graphics, this game is both horrible,\nand beautiful, as this game runs id's Tech 5 engine.\nCharacter textures, enemies, buildings, objects and furnitures,\nlook really good. In the beginning scene of the game, it's\nraining, and you can see how each droplet of rain hit\ntheir uniform and slowly getting soaked. Some of the\nterrain and scenery looks stunning.\n\nBut as with games running\nthe id Tech 4-5 engine, they do take a major hit when it\ncomes to performance, terrain/environmental and structural\ntextures. The textures simply are washed out, blurry and low-res,\nand because of the megatextures, you can see huge slow texture pop-in\nwhen turning around, instantly breaking your immersion in this game,\nreminding you all the time that this is just a program.\n\nAnd as many has been reporting, including myself, games running\nid Tech 5 engine has performance issues.\n\nThe graphics manages to impress me from time to time, but\nthe sad part is that the Tech 5 engine, really isn't a graphically\nimpressive engine, and this game would have done a lot better\nif they'd gone for a different engine.\n\nLooking away from the technical aspect of the graphics,\nthe game is mostly designed well. The enemies has alot of different\ntexture models, there's a good number of different enemies and\ndifferently themed areas, everything from isolated villages,\nurban cities to hospitals, you'll see new stuff and areas frequently,\nas the world you play in, is fractured and distorted.\n\nUnfortunately, some of the areas ain't as fun and exciting as others,\nthe industrial hospital themed areas which are used the most,\nare fun to begin with, but after a while you get tired of these places,\nas they are all similar, there's no big difference, it'll fell like you're\ndoing the same places over and over again.\n\nThe isolated village areas, one of the first areas you'll visit in this game,\nwas awesome, they were both creepy and cool, only sad part is\nthey're hardly ever used after the beginning.\n\nThe enemies in this game are ugly as ♥♥♥♥, in a good way.\nThey seem kinda like Resident Evil zombies mixed with\nSilent Hill, actually the entire game feels like a\nmix between Resident Evil and Silent Hill, which is a good thing,\nas they managed to do it successfully. Some of the bosses\nlooks really Silent Hill inspired, especially The Keeper, which\nyou can draw similarities with to Pyramide Head from Silent Hill.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, this game kinda feels like\nThe Last of Us, where improvised combat often plays\na big role, as you can stealth kill enemies, sneak around,\npick up objects on the ground and use against enemies.\nAmmo is limited, so exploiting hand-axes, bottles and\ntraps to take out enemies to convserve ammo is important,\nas (I played this on Survival difficulty) the game don't provide\nyou much with ammo or health, it's barely enough to save you\nfrom dangerous situations when you have no other way.\nPulling off headshots is critical, as ammo is rare and precious.\n\nThis creates a really good tension in this game, where the\nkey word in this genre of games, survival-horror, comes to play.\n\nThis game also has an interesting game mechanic, where you\ncan burn corpses. Why burn corpses you ask? Because unless\nyou've pulled off a sneak kill, or blown his head off, you can't\nreally be sure that it's dead. The only way to be 100% sure\nsomething is dead, is to burn them. This makes up some interesting\nsituations, as you'd enter a room, see some corpses on the ground,\nyou're not sure they're dead or not, and you can chain-combo-burn\nenemies to conserve ammo, shoot them in the leg, watch them\nfall over, run towards them and throw a match, and watch them burn.\n\nBut the gameplay ain't perfect, the controlls are slightly clumsy,\nand you'll probably accidentally fall of ♥♥♥♥ you're trying to stand on.\n\nYour weapons, and your character, are upgradable, and you'll have\ndifferent types of weapons to choose from as the game\nprogresses, which is good, because the enemies becomes\nharder later on in the game as they are introduced. Some enemies\nwears steel masks, so pulling off headshots might be more a waste of\nbullets than what you'd wish for as they often requires 3-4 shots to\nbreak through the mask then blow the head up, so shooting them in the legs,\nand burn them, is the more pleasing tactic to use for these enemies.\n\nThe story of this game, I found interesting. I was invested into\nknowing about what happened, why I am in this world and\nwho these characters are. The most interesting character\nis the Nurse, who resides inside your mental world, as it's\nthe safe place for you, where you can upgrade and save.\n\nBecause the story is really cryptic at the beginning, as it reveals\nvery little of what's actually going on, you might find\nyourself coming up with theories as of what's going on,\nwhich is always fun, and it's interesting to watch this distorted\nworld get even more weird, and watching your mental safe place\nbecoming unstable and changing. Unfortunately, the ending lacks\nclosure, and leaves a bunch of questions unanswered.\n\nAs for the value of this game, this game provides good\nvalue for your money. It took me roughly 16 hours to complete\nthis game, that's with a lot of exploring, after finishing this game\nyou can either start a New Game +, where you'll have your ♥♥♥♥\ncarried over plus some new weapons and upgrade gel,\nor you can starts a new game using one of the two new\ndifficulties unlocked.\n\n---CONCLUSION---\n\nThis game does many things correctly, and it's\nentertaining and gives a lot of value for your\nmoney, but it falls short at some aspects, mainly\ngraphics, some gameplay mechanics (control issues),\nand lack of closure and explanation of the story.\n\nBut I would still warmly recommend this game,\nfor those who are fans of Silent Hill and Resident Evil,\nor survival-games in general.\n\n---Score---\n\nGraphics: 7.0/10\nAudio: 7.5/10\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nStory: 7.5/10\nValue 9.0/10\n\nScore: 7.9/10","November 24, 2014","true","32.1"," 20 of 29 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","20","29","0","3"

It's just terrible given it uses the same Engine as Wolfenstein: TNO. The character models looks very out dated, the game has almost no graphical options and the FOV is so narrow I get nausea from it. Written Below\n\nhttp://youtu.be/QLdXnHGwfZ4\n\n\nThere's so much input lag that it feels like there's heavy mouse acceleration.\nThe take 1 step forward, and your character stumbles 3 steps always, from a single button press. Makes disarming traps hell.\n\nThe save system is punishing to say the least. There's only 1 checkpoint every 20+ minutes. Enemies kill you instantly, or at best two hits, and if they chase you I hope you enjoy kiting them for ever.\n\nYou can stealth kill them with a knife from behind, but you can never use that knife for anything else.\nIt takes 2-3 well places head shots to take down the basic enemy, despite them having a railroad spike through their heads, and stabbing them in the back of the head with the knife kills them.\n\nThe camera control is dire, and you can't look around corners unless you move out of cover.\n\nEnemy pathing gets stuck, so you can't sneak by them as they're stuck staring in your direction, and they're not patrolling.\n\nLoot that's vital to finishing chapters is horrible RNG, and the game often sets you up for failure. So then you're back 20+ minutes to your last check point.\n\nThere's also some chance of either you or an enemy partially clipping through a wall. So that enemy then goes ape as they've seen you. because of that glitch.\n\nIt's not scary, it's just frustrating, and annoying at best. The plot is nonexistent so far in the game\n\nTo make matters worse their touting of the game using the cinematic aspect ratio was a lie. I have a 3440x1440 21:9 aspect ratio monitor and I don't just have letterboxing, but I have pillar boxing.\n\nHere's a screenshot for all to gander at.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/UYeWoGu.jpg\n\nNote folks, I did unlock the fps, and remove the black letter boxing. That's still what I get. Sadly the game is locked at 16:9, and refuses to render properly in full screen at 3440x1440.\nAlso using the dev console commands disables Steam's Achievements and game tracking.\n\nEven with Crossfire and essentially two R9 280X's at that tiny window, the game has issues maintaining 30fps. It's just horribly optimized and makes you wonder just how the hell they could have gone and messed up so badly when Wolfenstein looked amazing, and ran brilliantly.\n\nThe Evil Within uses 4.8GB of VRAM on my GPU, and the usage is around 80-99% as well.\nThat screams lack of optimization.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/lj99KqI.jpg\n\nThe game will also fail to even start unless you have the Steam overlay enabled.\n\nIt lacks any detailed graphical options, and you can't even change the FOV, even through the cvars.\n\nMenu Screenshot\nhttp://i.imgur.com/CBZsMCI.png\n\nThe game needs a hell of a lot of patching to get it sorted, and I've got my fingers crossed the folks at Flawless Widescreen can fix the silly resolution and aspect ratio issues.\n\nSo far gameplay wise it's a mixed bag. It starts of slow, gives you a little jolt of what is supposed to be excitement, and than just limping about again slowly, and then que scary noise and some excitement. Hide in a locker Outlast style, and try to sneak by insane butcher, or sneak by torch wielding zombie.\n\n\nUp down, up down. That's the pace so far of the game, along with an horrendous save system that just wastes time.","October 13, 2014","false","3.5"," 276 of 502 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","276","502","2","16"

It is so satisfying shooting a gun in this game. The story starts out slow but builds up and keeps you confused on what's going on until the very end. This game is not really pop out scary but it's a stressful kind of scary in the sense of surviving. You can set up and disarm traps, upgrade weapons, sneak around stealth killing, hide and even craft bolts for your bow. You can stun, explode, start on fire, freeze and shatter people into bits. The game rewards you for exploring and it really pays off. I did alot of exploring in fact where it made me OCD looking left and right finding jars for upgrades, keys for unlocking stuff, disarming traps to craft with, ammo and health for survival. If you don't explore it will be a very hard game to beat. It doesn't hold your hand at all. You go to a boss fight empty handed you will be sorry. It's a really long game but you don't feel like it's too long since you will be upgrading and getting new weapons as well as seeing how the story unfolds. The mouse and keyboard controls are spot on.

Plot is unsatysfying and easly forgetable just like this game.\nWhen or rather if they patch this game to PC standards I might change my score for this game, for now it's 4/10.\n\nBTW.

It's a flat out awful PC port with a myriad of issues, including consistent crashes if you attempt to remove letterboxing or play above 30fps.  Even if you manage to get past that, the game itself really isn't all that fun either.  It plays very similarly to Resident Evil 4, naturally, but it feels like a downgrade.  Granted, pretty much every TPS after Resident Evil 4 feels like a downgrade, it's a weird feeling considering it is from the same director.\n\nThe story has a bit of potential but honestly doesn't live up to that at all.  It's a complete mess that doesn't make much sesne in the end.  By the credits, the entire game felt like an excuse to tease a sequel.  On top of all this, the end boss is so bad it misses the entire point of the cool psychological visuals that made the game moderately cool to look at.  Every single part of The Evil Within feels like a game that constantly falls short of what it could be if it was given more effort and thought.\n\nI suppose if you are like me and you want to just a little bit more of RE4 in your life you will get some enjoyment out of The Evil Within.  The 60 hours I spent in it was mostly out of boredom and a hope that higher difficulties or extra modes would unleash its true potential, but I was wrong.  Shinji Mikami has mentioned that he wants to be done with horror multiple times in the last few years, and this game is pretty good evidence of that boredom and contempt.","June 18, 2015","false","59.7"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","27","44","0","0"

They are written like children whining about two things, fps and aspect ratio. Both of which are very subjective details. I am honestly having a great time with the game. My graphics card only has 2 GB of Vram and it is running this game like a beast. If you like Survival Horror games with bit of stealth, this is right up your alley. Resource management is key and the game has mechanics from the RE remake (burning enemies) and the general gameplay of RE 4 plus a bit of stealth. The frame rate is locked to 30 fps but it is rock solid with no hitches for me. The aspect ratio is kind of weird at first but by the time the intro played out I didn't even notice it. Maybe it's because I'm playing on my TV, I dont know. The negative user reviews for this game were appallingly immature for a time and threw a lot of undeserved hate at the game due to it being a straight port. The developers announced their plans for the fps and aspect ratio weeks ago so any complaints about those is void in my opinion. With that said, if you get simulation sickness, you may want to look at some videos of the game to make sure if it will bug you or not. The people who made many of those negative reviews were either uninformed or were planning on complaining anyway. It is the same game that is on next-gen consoles (PC may look a little sharper I haven't seen the console versions).  The game is very playable and it is not a broken port, at least, not for me. If you were a huge RE fan I think you will have a very fun time with The Evil Within. So far I am having a blast. There hasn't been a game quite like this in years.\n\nYou might need a controller. I cannot speak for the controls on mouse and keyboard. From my experience playing any 3rd person game works better with a controller just like first person shooters are far better with mouse and keyboard. I have been hearing that playing on a\nTV negates the shock of the aspect ratio a bit so do your research if you are playing on a monitor. And for the love of god DO NOT come to this looking for a brilliant story! While Silent Hill games have had some pretty good stories the RE games have always had a sort of cheesy B movie plot. This game comes from the creator of Resident Evil so The Evil Within seems to naturally be going for the cheesy plot, though they seem to have dialed it down a bit. Voice acting is comparable to RE 4... serviceable but not award winning though I will say there seems to be less annoying characters like Ashley.\n\nThe real draw of this game is going to be the gameplay. Guns feel extremely satisfying to blast enemies with and they all have well done sound effects. The controls are designed in a way to make you feel unsafe at all times. You can move while aiming though I wouldn't advise taking a shot while moving because you will most likely miss unless you are at very close range. While your aim is initially inaccurate you can become more accurate as the game progresses by spending points in the games upgrade system. The upgrade system also includes things such as weapon capacity, damage, reserve capacity, reload speed, melee damage etc. The upgrades seem to allow for multiple play styles which is pretty cool.  Artificial intelligence isn't very smart but most enemies are bringing knives or claws to a gunfight so they are kinda dumba#$es to begin with. In other words, enemies with close range attacks are only going to have so many patterns because they eventually have to rush and kill you. I have not experienced any outstanding AI glitches but I have seen minor things like enemies hugging to close to corners and getting hung up for a second. Enemies are more dangerous in numbers than individually but they can be surprisingly fast. Headshots work best but if you knock one over you can light him up with a match or, even better, wait for other enemies to walk over him before burning them all. There are also multiple environmental dangers that you can use against your would-be killers. Tactics and precise shooting combine to make a very fun combat system. I am finding that I am dying less from regular combat and more from instakill bosses which can be frustrating to some. Nothing excessive though. Overall, the game balance is very good and I am making steady forward progress.\n\nThe Evil Within takes a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill in its environments. So far I have found a range of asylums, hospitals, labs, hellish otherworlds and so on. Character models and environments  look very good and the lighting is done particularly well. But this is not the game to benchmark your new rig on if thats what your are looking for. Some players report it as somewhat of a resource hog (maybe CPU?) but I am still finding no dips in the frame rate but I will make a note in the review if that changes.\n\nThe game is very dark, gory and intense if not necessarily scary. However, to be honest, I have never been utterly freaked out by any video game before. I am still finding it to be an awesome game. Unless I run into some absolute disasters on the way to the end (musical numbers), I believe genre fans will absolutely love this as long as they don't expect a full return to pure survival horror. The game does get a little action heavy toward the end featuring some gun-wielding enemies. Overall, though, I found it much closer to the tone of the original 3 RE games than 4 was. And there is no coop to be found, except for some AI partners (no, you don't have to share ammo) for brief instances. I am very glad for that last part.\n\nIf you are new to Survival Horror games know that the game is a little harder than your typical action game and you are expected to take your time and make your shots count. You also have less health than in most games but you can upgrade that as you progress. Your health only regenerates to a low amount if wounded and medkits and ammo are harder to come by than most games. You will be down to your last bullet in some fights. However, enemies will drop a couple of bullets (like 2 or 4 at most) every now and again and if you explore you should find enough rounds and matches to keep yourself alive. The game won't make things impossible for you. But you will rarely be flush with supplies.\n\nEdit: Whether you found it helpful or not, I want to say thanks to everyone who read the review. Like I said, I've never written one and I wasn't really expecting more than ten people to read it. It's a pretty cool unexpected surprise. I also wanted to throw some specs out there in case they help someone out. I will make any necessary changes to the review when I have completed the game.\n\nWindows 8.1\nCore i7 3770 3.40\n12 GB Ram\nRadeon Hd 7800 2GB Vram","October 14, 2014","true","33.3"," 274 of 507 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","274","507","0","58"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sol-Neutralguy/recommended/268050/","Sol-Neutralguy","Sol Neutralguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sol-Neutralguy/","410 products in account","So, I finally beat the game after going at it one chapter per night with some rest days between. It was a hell of a ride and in my opinion it would have been THE horror game had the last five chapters been as amazing as chapters 3-10. When the final tally was spinning I was terrified that I'd entered into three digit death territory after my 21 hour playthrough. I would have been legit ashamed, but thankfully (somewhat) I only died 88 times on survivor difficulty.\n\nThe bosses in this game can be the worst if you aren't observant. I tried to kill Laura for a good while at first because I wasn't paying full attention to my environment and her weaknesses. Really, this game is all about watching the bosses, watching the environments and moving constantly. Fire is your best friend in this game. If you are fighting a sub-boss or a boss and you are staying still it won't be pretty. The agony bolt REALLY showed it's stuff in the later boss battles with the capabilities of the flash, lighting and freeze bolts. If an enemy couldn't be flashed then it probably means you can freeze it or paralyze it for a few seconds to reload your weapons and make some spare explosive bolts. I probably died forty times to regular bosses and 3/4ths of it happened before chapter 10 because I moved, but didn't observe and I shot, but I didn't think to use anything more than explosive bolts+regular weapons. The bosses are creative/tough, but very beatable once you realize how useful the other bolts really are.\n\nThat said, up untl chapter 10 TEW was amazing and chapters 13-14 got sort of close to that feeling again. Chapter 15 was okay, but the highlight really was the final boss fight because until the finale stone face Seb just couldn't react to any of the crazy ♥♥♥♥ in the final chapter until Ruvik went all Kaiju on his ♥♥♥. Ruvik really managed to get a reaction out of Sebastian with that. Clearly the game is begging for a sequel because neither of the major two stories (Sebastian's and Ruvik) had a satisfying conclusion. Kidman's role in the story is also still shrouded in mystery.\n\nThe lighting, sound, enemy variety and resource management were tuned to literal perfection. I feel like these were the things Tango did best. Every chapter had gorgeous lighting with blacks that weren't crushed, appropriately revealing lighting and beautiful lighting effects on water, foliage and architecture (especially humid indoor environments). The sound design was particularly on the dot. Chapter 13 was particularly good about it (the hallways full of haunted and fake R****). Did anyone else notice that killing the first fake R**** and moving forward a bit caused more haunted to appear behind you? Very very few games actually do a good job of giving enemies proper sound direction and placement. The Evil Within on the other hand passed that test with flying colors and probably saved me quite a few times since the amazing sound reproduction warned me when someone was coming from 3 o clock,  9 o clock or 12 o clock. My only complaint was the tiny sound produced by the magnum which sounds tinier than the pistol. The enemy variety complimented the scarcity of resources perfectly too. My only complaint was the low number of invisible haunted. I'd have liked for the total number in the game to be more like 10-12 instead of the 4-5 we got. This game was chocked full of regular haunted, but it never got tiring thanks to regular appearances by slightly higher level opponents and challenging environments (multilevel, trap laced, open and tight spaces were all available). Every chapter started with a handful (or two at best) of bullets for your pistol and a handful for the rest along with a bolt or two of each type and I played very conservatively with lots of headshots and group burnings via matches. By the end of chapter 6 anyone playing on survival difficulty should be an ammo saving pro at any game.\n\nThe real weaknesses for me were the characters (or lack of), the gigantic bars, chapters 11-12, minimal movement abilities, the weak story and storytelling devices. Sebastian just didn't react at all even though things around him were going all Dead Space by chapter 14 and it can really take you out of the mood when someone doesn't react to this craziness. Kidman is another one. We heard almost nothing from her. I think all her lines could be written on a standard notebook page in extra large font. Joseph was sort of mundane, but I can sort of see from his personality that it's what they were going for. Unfortunately the game rarely (if ever) took a chance to move the story along with storytelling devices. Resident Evils 3 and below all did wonderful jobs with the creepy journal entries/lab notes (Metroid Prime also managed to instill a slight feeling of dread with the scanning storytelling ability), but Ruvik kept details a bit too vague in the audio logs. Now, the more technical gameplay weaknesses to me were on full display in chapters 11-12 (except 11's mannequin scene) and after experiencing them chapters 13-14 lost a bit of their luster. Somehow I was completely in love and I had almost forgotten the black bars until chapter 11 in the city. These stupid bars are downright fatiguing and I finally began to understand the complaints when I found my head hurting after a lot of squinting up/down to get a full look at the gradual destruction of Krimson city. Thankfully the headaches never came back for chapters 13 and over. The uncomfortable feeling I and a lot of other people have gotten from the camera would probably be helped by regaining that huge 30(+) percent of screen real estate taken up by those bars. Reducing the bar size and increasing the FOV will be the first order of business when I finally start my NG+ run. The movement in the game was also way too stilted for my taste. A simple roll like the one in Demon's Souls and Dark Souls combined with a basic manual cover system would make this game's combat scenarios almost perfect if they came with better (i.e. less exaggerated) melee animations. Some of the boss fights and all the group battles in this game would be immensely more fun and fluid if Sebastian could dance around them a bit and dodge dramatically when a boss is about to crush him or drag him to his death.\n\nBased on the demo I'd have never expected anything less than an 8/10, but the version I played sits at the best 7/10 a game can get. I expect FOV and bar fixes will push it up to a solid 8, but all the modding in the world isn't going to improve the admittedly great (but not perfect) combat and weak story/characters. If ANY game needs a sequel it's TEW. I really hope this holiday season was great for Bethesda and Tango because a little more heat and pressure is going to give us a real diamond if they decide to follow up and polish what needs polishing. I got the game for $16 thanks to GMG so I should probably buy a season pass for the DLC (never bought a season pass for a game before) in order to show my support for the IP and Tango.\n\nEven my modest i5 2500k setup held a solid 30FPS with everything maxed at 1080p with SMAA. Anyone with a GTX 580/660 and above should be able to play TEW at 30FPS even without overclocking. Those lucky 4GB card owners should have no problem downsampling the game too. The PC version is the way to go with this game, people.","January 3, 2015","true","40.1"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

A fun game. Admittidly a fairly confusing story for some, but the gameplay (In my opinion at least) more than makes up for it. I grew to like the characters (Especially Leslie and his little hobble) and really got into the game. The boss fights for the most part were challenging enough that it wasn't an easy fight, yet it was still very much enjoyable. The final fight though? Didn't live up to my expectations, truth be told. I died 129 times in my first playthrough, and only one of those times was to the final boss, Amagamation (If I recall correctly). In terms of replayability? Well one of the first things I did after finishing The Executioner was restart the game in New Game+ mode, mainly to work on 100%'ing the achievements but hey, we all have our reasons. The DLCs, for the most part weren't my cup of tea. I didn't get this game for a stealth experience, as in The Assignment and The Consequence, however I really, really did enjoy the slaughterfest that was The Executioner. The story for the DLCs I would say, is better than the main game itself, but that's just a matter of opinion.\nFor a full playthrough of the main game, and soon to be DLCs and a spoken review, check out my playlist below!\nhttp://  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLecE5B63z3fo1sfQOJxXd7Fn6hl2s0Z8f","April 19","true","37.7"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Because what it has to offer, is something so big, that it will leave you speechless everytime you progess. During my first 30 minutes of gameplay, I've never ever been that excited playing a game before. Because it felt like it was the mother of all the great horror games ever made. Not because it's scary, but because one moment it feels like you're playing Outlast, and the other it's Alan Wake, then it's Silent Hill, Resident evil, Alone in the Dark 2008, Dark Souls boss fights, Eternal Darkness... Just name it! It even had some Tomb Raider 2013 feeling in the begining. All these great titles delivered to you in one game!

But that doesn't mean it doesn't have its scary moments, because it still delivers horrifying anxiety, when you hide under the beds, in closets, trying not to get caught or escaping while being chased by a dozen of those dark creatures. So why not read more about the game, watch gameplays to get your facts right before buying it. Because I'm sure as hell, some people bought this game only because of the hype and attention it got before the release, which makes them ♥♥♥♥ing idiots. It's a survival game, where there will be parts where you need to fight to stay alive. Parts where you will have to change your pants. And parts where you keep repeating what the ♥♥♥♥ is happening.\n\nThird, Shinji Mikami! Period! End of!\n\nOne more thing I'd like to point out, people who down voted this review, or didn't like this game, Because whether it's too difficult for them so they got frustrated, or simply didn't progress. So they decided to hate it and cry over the $60. I myself, wasn't sure if I wanted to continue playing it aswell, because it got repetitive and sort of "boring" during chapter 2 and 3 and a bit of 4. But I'm so glad I did! Was finally out of the woods, and the story made more sense... in a nonsense way...? So you people don't know what you're missing. The horror and thriller are back, and mostly the survival feeling. Because whatever choice I made to stay alive, turned out to be just right. Which gives the game a great taste of reality. Not to mention how challenging it is. I stopped counting the times I died, and I'm playing on normal mode. Not to mention the plot twists and complete nonsense that will make you want to know what's going on or even where you are.\n\nAlso the mighty Bethesda made an update which fixed so so many issues, like the broken achievements, which I dare you to get, no more black bars and boxes, and you get to play with 60 fps.\n\nThe Evil Within, is a horror survival psychological game, which means you never know what to expect next. It's nerves ratteling and mind blowing. You are detective Sebastian Castellanos, investigating a mass murder took place in an asylum I'd say. And that's where you will face a powerful force and find yourself in mysterious worlds, literally struggling to survive against dead creatures and cruel traps for a way out and for answers. The tension and anxiety will grow more and more as you progress, expecting fear from any direction and at any time.\n\nThe Evil Within is the kind of game, that will make you say, screw the achievement, I'm getting the hell out of here. Then make you want to restart it and challenge yourself. Forget all the hype and attention it got before the release. Yes it maybe is not what we were all expecting. But it's still so damn worth it. A beautiful atmospheric game, everything featured wonderfully, great ambiance, fun gameplay, and very well scripted. Calm your ♥♥♥♥ and give it a go, you will end up living a very rewarding intense adventure.","January 22, 2015","true","11.8"," 28 of 47 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","28","47","4","6"

But then again when the director is the very same that did the Gamecube Resident Evil remake (by far the best RE game and one of the best games ever made) and Resident Evil 4 it's not really that suprising. It's got the atmosphere and art direction of the former and the supremely playable action of the latter. Oh and it's got monsters and enemies straight out of Silent Hill! What a combo!\n\nI liked this game alot. It's really well paced, great fun to play, is very good looking with some great creature designs, has some really beefy sound effects and a great score. It's quite challenging at times making for some real intense moments! I also liked the central hub system, which you can travel back and forth to at various points in the game to save, upgrade yourself and your gear and to catch your breath :) It is also a decent length. It took me 20 hours to complete on normal (survival) and i missed quite a few collectables. Talking of which they are actually worth collecting, as some of them can be taken back to the hub to unlock extras as you go. A plus point there.\n\nThe downsides are few, the story is a bit nonsensical and sometimes i felt cheated when i died. Most of the time it was my fault though for not item managing well enough. I died alot! :)\n\nI'm planning to run a New Game +. As i want to use my newly unlocked items for beating the game ;) and finish upgrading. Also just because i want to play it again.

I'll explain the method for sorting the Aspect ratio and FPS at the bottom.\n\nAlso to note is the fact that 4GB VRAM seems like total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to me (particularly as they said that roughly when nvidia released their new cards, conspiracy anyone?), I'm using a OC 670 with 2GB VRAM; with unlocked Framerates and an altered aspect ratio i get roughly 46FPS. I will be honest and say that 60FPS on this game is unlikely for 90% of people but in all honesty the 30FPS didnt really detract for me at all.\n\nNow, the GAME is a literal love letter to old school survival horror, this game is what resident evil 5 should of been, the gameplay will take you back to resident evil 4 in a big way; difference here being theres a much heavier atmosphere, Seriously you can cut it with a knife.\n\nThe game also starts you off essentially helpless, and on normal difficulty you will be running your ♥♥♥ away literally screaming  obsentitys due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and his chainsaw behind you (also you can hide and your only way of telling where he is will be the distant motor of the chainsaw and you heartbeat getting louder as he draws near. Get those headphones on; will help the fear factor.)\n\nThat becomes less the case as you find weapons through the game making you less likely to run out of ammo, but i promise even on normal difficulty i never felt like i had much ammo to waste, i always was paranoid i was wasting ammo.\n\nThe story isn't bad, kinda typical Asian Horror style, one missed call, grudge-esque combined with silent hill (the game not the movie). But i'll admit i would basically refer to it as a Fever dream, you or the character dont really know whats real, someone asked me whats happening in the game when i was afew hours in... i could only answer "I don't know" lol.\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who misses what survival horror used to be. Its not innovation, but it is something we haven't had since resident evil 4 back in 2005, i dont know about you, but its been long overdue for me.\n\nTo fix either black bars or FPS go to Your user folder, (C,Users,-account name->> Saved Games>>>tango gameworks>> the evil within>>base....\nopen the cfg file and add in "R_forceaspectratio 1.8" for no bars but to be honest, I found "2" to be a better balance due to the FOV.\nFor FPS put "R_swapinterval 0" for unlocked fps. "-1" for 60fps and "-2" for 30fps. You should do this using the config file is you care about achievements which using the in game console seems to break mildly until you turn it off.\n\nEdit: Alternatively Flawless Widescreen has a plugin that fixes the black bars AND the FOV now so thats now the better option","October 21, 2014","true","42.4"," 43 of 76 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","43","76","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowonHokkaido/recommended/268050/","SnowonHokkaido","¤ Queen of Doughnuts","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SnowonHokkaido/","183 products in account","What is the Evil Within?\nI bought the main game a few months ago, in autumn 2015. Several horror games had been released at that time and having previously finished Alien Isolation, I thought I'd give it a go. At that time, I didn't know anything about the partly negative reviews and simply played the game for the game's sake. Being an experienced gamer and too smug, I picked a hard difficulty and almost wanted to give up because the first level was too hard. As a matter of fact, this game is hard, really hard. If you've played Dark Souls, you're used to dying over and over again, but in the Evil Within, you also don't have the ammunition you need. Add a lot of blood and gore and the basic survival instincts evoked by the creepy music and atmosphere, you get an atmospheric game unlike many others. Hence, if you are looking for the basic horror thrill that'll make you cringe and unable to look at the screen because that mass murderer's waiting for you, you'll be disappointed with this purchase. I cannot state how important that is but this game is classified as psychological horror and will thus also make you experience the feeling of threat, not fear.\n\nWhat is playing the game like?\nYou have the option to choose between 3 difficulties, and once you've finished the game, you'll additionally unlock another option. Similar to Resident Evil, ammo drops are rare in the Evil Within and you WILL need to save ammo at certain points. The game has about 14 chapters, which are usually 1-2 hours; beating the entire game took me about 17 hours (with achievements). You also have the option to purchase the DLC (Season Pass advised), which adds another 5-6 hours play time. Several guns are available, as well as advanced weapons, which will ensure your survival at some points. Generally speaking, staying hidden is your best bet at survival, but don't take it for granted. Some enemies will spot you no matter what, and give you a heartattack when they ambush you. Once you hear the famous piece of music Clair De Lune, you'll also know when it's time to save your game and upgrade your skills and weapons with items you'll likely pick up during the main campagne. But be advised that spotting certain items can be a difficult task in itself, since you'll be required to use ammo. Be prepared to compromise, and planning can save your butt ;-)\n\nThe story\n- In the main game, you play as Sebastian, a police officer who ends up right in the middle of a creepy case. Fighting your way through a hospital, a forest and village, and past hordes of enemies, you soon realize that something is off. The enemies are supernatural zombies, and you are getting chased by an unnatural force. Digging into the background information, you will realize that nothing is as it seems and this world is trying to reject you like an unwanted organ. Somebody has been following you and he is very angry, ready to rip you apart.\n\n- In the DLC, you play as officer Kidman who presents her part of the story, with a different approach to fighting and stealth. Hey, man, you're a lady, you can't shoot that.\n\nJokes aside, I'm seriously in love with the story. I don't want to spoil too much, but you will get mind♥♥♥♥ed. The story is not linear and is really complex considering the game's overall set up. You will need to pay attention to the details and read as many of the collectibles in the game as possible since they are all part of the main plot. Playing the DLC is essential in my opinion since it explains why the events happened the way they happened. I've read a lot of negative reviews about the story, how it does not make sense, but just like Bioshock Infinite, this game leaves room for interpretation, and you'll need to make up your own mind. Nevertheless, the Evil Within combines survival horror with natural sciences and the human mind. It is an excellent approach to new research and challenges the player with ethical questions. I seriously love the main anatgonist, and he's the best developed character in my opinion, whereas Sebastian is more or less the standard troubled hero on his mission for revenge.\n\nQuick summary\n- long main campaign\n- predictable character development (main character)\n- will seem repetitive after dying again\n- upgrading system expensive and will trick you into buying things you don't need\n- some enemies are ridiculously OP\n- scarce ammo\n- no advanced AI (enemies follow a path, or you)\n\n+ game+ mode which allows you to use your upgrades again, on a higher difficulty\n+ 1 hit mode which is even more challenging\n+ complicated story with a lot of attention to detail\n+ best developed antagonist I've seen in a long while\n+ blood and gore (and a lot!)\n+ achievements are a real challenge (you'll hate yourself!)\n+ aiming is hard\n+ stripped to basic survival instincts (stealth, low stamina, HP, etc)\n+ great graphics + atmopshere (greetings to my fellow games which I cannot play due to my old Nvidia)\n+ creepy music and the feeling of threat - ever run for your life? this is what it feels like\n+ several types of enemies, new ones in each chapter\n\nTl:dr\nIf you're into Slenderman style horror and love being unable to look at your screen, this is the wrong game for you. The plot is challenging, the game is frustrating and some enemies are unnaturally strong. However, if you like psychological horror and aren't afraid to look at brains (you'll meet a lot, hello!), this may be the right game for you. Get the DLC on sale and take your time to actually play the game, you'll get rewarded. In for a challenge? In for a chainsaw wielding maniac? In for that sexy antagonist who won't be so sexy anymore once he's undressed? You might as well play this game.\n\nMy personal favourite game 2015.","April 6","true","55.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

You will miss a ton as accuracy is a lot lower than typical games, for a reason. Ultimately as you get more powerful weapons EW becomes a lot less strict and wants you to shoot a lot more things.\n-Interesting enemy/boss design for the most part.\n-Atmospheric lighting/visuals.\n-Level of tension can be very high. Whether this is what 'scary' means to you is personal preference.\n-20 hrs of gameplay out of the box.\n-Leveling system that actually matters and will make you thoroughly consider upgrades.\n-Framerate lock and black bars can be changed now (I believe).\n\nCONS\n-Story is stupid, though no dumber than most horror games. Just ignore it.\n-Textures not amazing.\n-Some crashes, though I only had 3 in the whole 20 hours. Not great, not horrible.\n-Bosses are also 'unfair' in the sense that death is a certainty until you figure out what the intended approach is. In some cases this becomes really rigid, and it's annoying. Personally I would rather spend 1-2 hours doing this this than grind out Dark Souls until I'm 60, though.\n\nNEUTRAL\n-Identity crisis. This game starts out firmly expecting you to take a stealth approach with extemely limited ammo. It plays basically like the stealth component of 'The Last of Us'. I would say the majority of the game, however, or solidly half, dispenses with stealth altogether and requires combat with enemy waves cleared, etc. Even after this point it still doesn't always seem 100% clear on what type of game it wants to be. It didn't bother me, but it might bother you.\n\n\nAll in all this is a worthwhile, enjoyable game without much competition in its peer class (are you aware of that many great 3rd person action/survival horror games lately?) Steam reviewers initially mistreated it for its technical 'issues' (choices?), and while I understand their perspective this game simply isn't as bad as was once pretended.\n\n","May 19","true","21.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

Neither will The Evil Within be for everyone.\nThe Evil Within focuses on inflicting terror into your brain, rather than having jumpscares. The game looks more like a piece of wicked art, rather than a game - however it's a pretty much flawless piece of art to say the least.\n\nTEW will let you experience disgust, fear and " WTF moments" - a lot. It features a dark atmosphere combined with fitting music. Compared to "older survival horror" titles TEW is no exception when it comes to action, as it is fast paced action filled combat - just as in Biohazard 4.\n\nThe PC requirements are a complete joke and should be ignored by 95 % of the folks who want to buy/play the game. TEW is a console port and shows it off proudly, by having 30 FPS lock and a weird FOV.\nThe 30 FPS lock can be easily disabled via Steam  " Launch Options " - even though the game runs surprisingly smooth on 30 FPS already.\n\nA lot of people say that the BLACK BARS are a giant nuisance, however - they are sooooo important when it comes to atmosphere. Removing them will allow you to see above ledges, farther around corners etc and it WILL RUIN THE GAME.\nAs I've said before, TEW relies on terror and fear, leaving the player guessing where the enemy might be. Disabling the black bars will remove exactly this part of the game and will leave you with a generic horror shooter.\n\n______________________\n\nAll in all the game is awesome. If you've liked BIo4 / RE4 - you will like TEW as well.\nHow scary the game actually is, depends on your brain alone.\nThe more you dive into the game - the more it will frighten you.\n\nOh and the voice acting is bad.\n\n\n","October 19, 2014","true","16.6"," 51 of 92 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","51","92","0","0"

The gunplay is fun, the story is a little weird, but just good enough to keep you entertained. The characters are a little forgettable, and the sideplot about Sebastian's life really doesn't seem to matter at all. There's literally nothing I could find in game that pertained to it besides journal entries.\n\nI know people are saying that it's just RE4, but it really isn't JUST RE4. The gunplay is definitely far more fluid, and the controls are very responsive. The puzzles are pretty easy, but it's not a puzzle game. The game isn't really "scary" either, but after playing 18 hours of it, I honestly don't think it was meant to be scary. Or at least it doesn't feel like it. The horror aspects of the game feel more like just adrenaline-pumped, action-packed bits of fun.\n\nAll in all, don't buy it if you're looking to get scared. Don't buy it if you're looking for a NEW and INVENTIVE game. The Evil Within takes Shinji Mikami's strengths and puts them to good use. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but it does everything we have seen before pretty well.\n\nThe one and only negative I have with this game, is the damn unstable framerates. Forced capped 60 frames runs GREAT and has a nice polish to it....BUUUUUUUUUUUUT, the framerate is unstable, and there are LOTS of microstutters in this game. If you play it in the capped 30FPS mode, it runs fine, it's just slightly choppy but your eyes do get used to it.\nPersonally, I just powered through it at the 60 FPS cap, and my eyes eventually just gave in and I stopped noticing it.\n\nSolid 8/10, I'll be playing NG+.","December 29, 2014","true","18.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

Honestly, the only feeling of dread in this game is wondering how long it's been since the last save as you watch your character's umpteenth gruesome death animation.\n\nI don't mind challenging games.  I like the sparse ammo in this kind of survival horror genre that forces you to place your shots carefully, or look for alternatives.  (I also thought the visuals and general mood -- at least the first time through each section -- were outstanding.)  But the challenge here comes primarily from the picky, sluggish controls and the restrictive camera.  Even just picking an item up off the floor requires precision aim, made worse by the fact that when your character breaks open a container he lunges past it, so that you have to turn around to find any item that may have been inside.\n\nAnd, speaking of item crates, this game commits the classic game sin of penalising you for trying to role play the character you are given.  Often the game or NPCs tell you to move to a goal urgently, but if you do so instead of examining every dark corner and breaking open every container, you'll miss out on myriad much-needed upgrade items, because almost every single time you go through a big door, it slams behind you and you're forever cut off from that part of the game, with the autosave annoyingly deciding that *now* -- and not just before a boss fight -- is the best time for it to take action.\n\nIf you like playing sections of a game over and over (and over) because the game actively fought your commands, this may be the game for you.

(Top and Bottom of screen, similar to a cinematic view).\n\nMassive Framerate issues.As for my experience, the letterboxes were a bit disappointing at first but after playing the game for about 10-15 minutes I began to realize that the letterboxes weren't really bothering me and that they weren't really getting in the way of enjoying the game.\n\nI didn't run into framerate issues either with the exception of one very small house where the framerate dipped into the 15-25 fps range.  That was it though.  The rest of the game was very playable and the area with the framerate issue was literally an extremely small house in one small part of one chapter.  It really wasn't a big deal considering how much detail the environments have in them.\n\nNow that I've touched on the main complaints of the general public, on to the game.\n\nUltimately I really enjoyed playing the game and ended up replaying the additional new game+ mode that is unlocked after completion.\n\nThe game leans more towards being a "Psychological Horror" and while it may not be subjectively "pee-your-pants" scary it does a great job at building tension.\n\nObservant players will notice all kinds of subtle things that will try to mess with your head throughout the game\n\nEven though it's a PC Game, I recommend using a controller for this one as it was very comfortable.\n\nPros: Good Atmosphere\nFits into the Psychological Horror category\nLots of tension - so many sequences where I managed to survive just barely.  The game is fairly well balanced.\nVery interesting story if you're willing to take your time, dig around and read\nInteresting characters\nSolid Control Scheme\nVery elaborate and intense bosses\nOverall the game has a lot of variety in terms of environments and sequences the player encounters\nSemi-spoiler\nThe Agony Crossbow is fun\nCons: It would be nice to have the entire screen space be useable\nIt would be nice to play the game at 100-150 fps\nThere is one small spot in the game where the framerate dropped below the acceptable 30fps\nIf you prefer to use a controller other than the Xbox360 controller, a controller emulator will probably be necessary.\nShinji Mikami's still got it.\n\nHighly Recommended.","November 22, 2014","true","40.0"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","18","30","0","0"

This is not a scary game, at all. It's pure action horror, with a heavy emphasis on exploring the area you're trapped it. Running through a level head on like Resident Evil 5 will get you annihilated, but checking every nook and cranny for supplies is fun, and makes things a hell of a lot easier. Looking for extra ammo, and Green Gel to beef up your character is really rewarding. This game is like the entire generation of action horror games rolled in one, playing it reminded me heavily of Resident Evil 4, Resident Evil 5, Dead Space, Shadows of The Damned, and Silent Hill Downpour.\n\nMy only real gripes are that the story is all over the place and kinda hard to follow. The main character Sebastian is just too much of a badass, absolutely NOTHING in the game phases this guy, even the damn Batman isn't as much of a brick wall to fear as this guy. It really makes the scare factor hard to take seriously. Also the difficulty the first time through can get insainly frustrating with one-hit kills around every corner of the later levels.\n\nI have this game on the PS3 so this is my second realy playthrough, playing the game a second time even without new game+ is a blast, the game is much more enjoyable now that I know what I'm doing in each level. The PC port is nothing special, but is an improvement, I recommend it.","December 24, 2015","true","12.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The lighting is vibrant and the effects are so well it cannot be summed up in just a few words.\n\nGameplay: Awesome visuals, suspense gut wrenching action sequences usually involving chase scenes both in the sense of a pun considering this is a very gory horror game at times with harsh , violent deaths and due to the factor of suspension of desbelief  plus suspense. Good layout between using bolts , weapons like handgun ; shotgun and pretty good wheel to select from weapons you need.\n\nStory:\n\nThis is the reason you buy this game. This game is so much better than Resident Evil in my opinion and cannot even compare ,though I have not played at all much Resident evil except for some of Resident Evil Revelations. The main concept of the story in which is not a spoiler is the use of hallucinations where the character is not always himself. Hence the game title  The Evil Within meaning that in all of us there is some evil within our thoughts even outside our own human conscience that cannot be explained in real life.\n\nThus, it incorporates a dream-type world where you see within the thoughts of one of the character's without being able to figure out the rest of the plot until you continue chapter after chapter.\n\nSound and Ambiance: Incredible ambiance from zombies, monsters groaning  to intense sequences etc...\n\nOverall: 10/10. This game is produced in the highest possible quality creating quantum leaps into the horror genre. It has all elements any horror fan wants in tense moments and then combined with calm moments in between. I absolutley love how  the developer implemented this. I have enjoyed this game even alot better than Outlast. Many people say that Outlast is scarier then this game so to conclude I will give my comparison.\n\nComparison and how it holds up to Outlast:\n\nOutlast for me had more jump scares then from what I have played of The Evil Within so far. However, The Evil Within has made me tense every single major boss battle with big monsters usually coming to chop your head off. What is cool and what I did like is they have hiding spots in The Evil Within which is similar to how Outlast works. Lastly, The Evil Within in my opinion has a better story, cinematics and you have to conserve , manage and use your ammo wisely or else you could be stuck in situations with little ammo in The Evil Within which then becomes a hellish Nightmare.\n\nAwesome game. Also others have complained about the game having bugs and crashes with some reviews. However, I have encountered no crashes, bugs nor lag throughout me playing at the highest settings on my pc on this. Terrific game if you need something to do in some spare time and don't feel like watching a horror movie.\n\n*** NOTE*** The game has been taking me longer per chapter just because in this first playthrough I  have stealthed most of it so far by crouching every chance around corners I get. You can play either that way and be sneaky or you can just run through the whole game by sprinting and walking.","January 13, 2015","true","42.7"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","1"

Also i'm still going to play again because this game has a New Game + option with bonuses on your second playthrough.\n\nBetter than resident evil in my opinion, Introduce a few more interesting characters and keep this franchise going it could definitely be the next big game series, Had so much fun worth every penny.

Catacombs, hospitals, villages at night, all look great and are designed nicely both from the level design perspective and the visuals. The amount of work that was put into designing enviroments and enemies is stunning and if you like pretty games, check this one out, because it's one the best grit and rust fueled videogame nightmares out there.\n\nThe gameplay is basically Resident Evil 4 with a dash of stealth and a clever fire mechanic. It's also considerably harder, since ammo is pretty scarce and the zombies are tough SOBs. And this is just your normal mode, game features hard and even insane mode, which are not just punishing, but probably the hardest thing you ever played! Oh and it also comes with NG+ and a bunch of unlockable stuff, so you can blast your way through after completing the game one time!\n\nThe story is pretty clever and i'm glad nobody is spoiling it, since i'm actually excited to see it through. So far, it's surprisingly coherent, not in your face and feature a lot of imagery that intertwines with the main theme of the game. It's pretty subtle overall, where reality and nightmare come crashing down on each other and the understanding of the story is completely on your shoulders, nobody will sit you down in a cutscene and explain it all.\n\nIf you want a new survival horror game that is well paced and fun, get it. You may want to wait a bit to see if they'll release some kind of patch, but it's mighty playable as it is. Weird aspect ratio is not that obnoxious and you get used to it just as you get used to FoV in Dead Space.\n\nP.S. You can unlock aspect ratio, FPS and even tweak some visuals, just take a look at the Steam Guides.","October 14, 2014","true","52.0"," 178 of 339 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","178","339","0","15"

With that said, the game does have a few cool moments here and there. And if you were are able to push yourself through the terrible parts you might enjoy it more than I had. I was really hoping for solid horror experience. Instead I received a poor man's Resident Evil. One thing I would give this game though, is that it was genuinely spooky.

But in the end I'm a bit surprised with how much I liked it. The first chapter is terrible, starting with the typical later day Resident Evil action set piece (complete with someone that would be at home in the Matix), and followed up with an awkwardly scripted stealth sequence. Get past that though, and I think you'll  get into the game. It's clearly heavily leaning on Resident Evil 4, and that's not something I mind. It's not really scary but it does have some great atmosphere and creepy monster designs. It gets pretty action heavy, especially toward the end, so your taste for the game will probably depend on if you liked the RE4 era changes or only want the old Resident Evil flavor.\n\nIt does have some downsides, like the technical aspects that have been widely discussed. One of the weapons you get is a crossbow with like 7 different arrow types which makes switching between them kind of clunky. Lastly the story feels incomplete. I don't mean in the sense of it being dumb or making little sense (though it does have helpings of that) but it clearly feels like some of the major questions of the game are going to be answered in the upcoming DLC. While I'm all for DLC that feels substantial, this game feels like it's going to flat out require it by the end.","November 13, 2014","true","26.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

The world which this game takes place in is nothing short of awesome!! dream like and freaky is the best way to describe it. Rooms warp into others leaving the main character unsure of where he actually is. The graphics are decent with some great special effects and the sound is once again top quality. It mayb like Resident Evil and be made by the same guy but it doesnt suffer from that games crap camera angles, choosing a third person view has worked well along with well timed cut scenes. At parts this game will scare you... particularly Laura, she reminds me of the grudge and the ring `shivers`. Overall a great game, one I totally recommend to anyone stupid enough to read this.

I say people should stop whining, first of all these people should have done their research beforehand, before just giving it a bad review because your computer isn't good enough to run it. Despite 30 FPS (which is being rumored to be the new default norm for future games) or the cinamatic black bars, I have enjoyed what I have played, as well as seen of this game, in this case the negative reviews are just as bias as those that give Resident Evil 6 bad reviews because it is different than it's predecessors. I would give it a reccomendation because it is just an entertaining game to me, same with Resident Evil 6, to me this game does get that feeling of Resident Evil meets Silent Hill meets a typical Bethesda game, which doesn't mean that it is bad at all. All I am saying is this isn't a game for everyone, so if you either aren't confident in your PC's specs, only care about you maxing out the game, or if you aren't big on Survival/Psychological Horror, then this game may not be for you. But for those who enjoy at least decent gameplay, as well as a unique story, then I would recommend this game for you.","October 15, 2014","true","8.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

The story is great and sure the shooting could be improved but as far from that, Evil Within is worth your time.  Boss fight's is a bit inspired by Dark Souls, The way they are introduced and it's up to you to learn their moves and how to defeat them. Not as difficult as Dark Soul boss's ofcourse. Here they are easier to learn and defeat them.\n\nYou need to save your bullets for your worst enemies. Less resources, more puzzles and fun! yay!\n\n\nThe devs updated with adding  framerate cap to 60 fps and letterboxing options. Enabling console doesn't prevent you from getting achievements anymore. While these options should've been there from the beginning it's nice to see that these issues have been addressed.\n\n\nI didn't have a problem playing this game before these issues were addressed.

Before I go into details, it's a solid  7 out of 10. The story is relatively interesting, however the protaganist and people directly associated with him seem flat personality wise, with or without regards to their occupations. There are a few puzzles and navigation scenes that are actually fun, and replay value is good for 3-8 times depending on how much of a completionist you are. The sound design is very effective, however what little musical scoring there is doesn't seem to add much impact when it does appear. The bosses in this game have great visual design, but the execution of the encounters are poor. There are alternate ways to deal with most of the bosses, but most of them come to you through trial and error, not any observation of the environment or the enemy itself. The three styles of playing through most of the areas (Shooting, using traps, stealth) don't often actually present you with much indication as to if you can actually go through with it. For example, there are areas where stealth is plausible, but the arangement of the enemies or environment don't give you hints or lend credence to the idea that you CAN go through someplace playing a certain way. The gunplay is rather clunky, in that the crosshair tends to move a bit stiffly, and the camera while aiming is only effective in corridors, a result of the camera being too close most of the time. The game is still littered with bugs after several months, such as the match mechanic not triggering half the time, enemies detecting you through walls while sneaking, and in very tight quarters sometimes your weapons will not do any damage. If you don't want any information about the ending so you can experience it yourself skip the rest of this, not spoiling anything, just don't want the ending to be hyped or de-hyped. The ending of this game because of the lore that has built up around you, is utterly inconclusive. I don't know if someone dropped the ball behind the scenes, or if this is some production/marketing scam to aggressively hook people into buying the dlc, but needing to buy an extention to finish a story, is absurd. You could draw paralells to Mass Effect 3, but that ending had a conclusion, it wasn't presented in the way everyone wanted, but there was ultimately resolution. Evil Within did not deliver on my expectations at all. The first playthrough was fun for story purposes, but most of the enjoyment dips greatly after the first ride. I really, really wanted to like this game, and I'm sure others feel the same way, but with the production value this game seems to have, it just falls short.","January 26, 2015","false","71.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Main differences are that, in TEW, the melee is toned down quite a bit and a crouch-stealth mechanic is added. TEW has very good graphics in terms of atmosphere and lighting. Levels are long and varied with only little reuse of stuff, so it never feels repetitive. Bosses are well designed and the boss fights challenging and interesting. Story is kinda Lynchian (and so not everyone's cup of tea), but kept me interested until the end - I got to say I really, really liked this game.\n\nThe Bad: The port is optimized poorly. Only with the best GPUs you will get 60fps. With midrange GPUs you might fall well below 30fps easily even on the lowest settings, leading to a clunky feel of control. (It *is* possible though to up the framerate somewhat using certain tricks - after alot of fiddling I myself play TEW with a Geforce GT 540M with acceptable results.) Please consider this before buying.\n\n************\n\nUPDATE: I think this might be of additional interest to you. I have a rather lowend rig: I7 quadcore @2Ghz with a by now totally outdated Geforce GT 540M (yes, it's a laptop). Still I can run the game with 30fps and without stutter or hitching using the following settings:\n\n- I keep the letterbox enabled (ups framerate).\n- I lowered the resolution to 1280p.\n- I use the 30fps cap without vsync (vsync wouldn't really work in this game, but it would cause input lag on potatoes anyway!).\n- I turned off all ingame graphic enhancements like bloom, motion blur, AA etc - I just kept shadows on medium as on low they are too blocky.\n- I turned off postprocessing with the launcher command r_skipglare 1. This improved framerate quite a bit. It does not in fact turn off all effects, don't worry! Especially lighting is still great. Game gets a "warmer" overall hue, though.\n\n*************\n\nUPDATE 2: In the meantime, I switched to a much more powerful rig using a Geforce GTX 980M. Game is running smoothly on max settings and HD resolution, but there still are a few situations where 60 fps cannot be held. My verdict that the game is lacking in the optimization department still stands.\n\nRegarding the game itself, I found that it really begins to shine in nightmare mode. Here, not only are the enemies harder and more aware, the enemy placement itself is often different. Nightmare mode forces the player to carefully pick strategies and utilize the whole of the environment - this becomes very obvious in chapter 2 already. I feel that this is how the game was actually meant to be played.\n\nI'd also like to recommend using "Flawless Widescreen" with "The Evil Within". It allows you to adjust the FOV to your liking. It is also working with the DLC. Speaking of which: The first two are excellent additions, elaborating on the stealth mechanics as well as the story. I personally didn't like the third DLC which is a first person melee/boss rush mode which - in my opinion - doesn't quite fit.","January 25, 2015","true","200.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I mainly missed these as I was playing through this game personally and was too focused on the fact this game was so boring, i wanted it to end asap. I just cannot let it go and must write something about it, such as this review. Lets get down to it, if you are a fan of horror games and haven't played this, please pass on this; you already have played this game. Otherwise, get it on sale or even better, watch a longplay of it online, you'll get the same experience.\n\nPros:\nGraphics are pretty sweet (awesome asthetics and cool effects here and there)\n\nCons:\n\nCombat is very clunky (Take over-the-shoulder but make it worse)\nPlot is all over the place and very unoriginal, even illogical at times (It actually makes no sense whatsoever)\nRPG and crafting elements are kept to a bare minimal (crafting only affects one weapon, and the RPG elements involve just getting upgrades)\nGameplay is very repetitive (go from point A to Point B and shoot people, barely any puzzles in the game and the bosses all feel the same)\nExtremely Linear\nA lot of this is inspirripped from other games (Almost all of it is like: Silent Hill, Resident evil, Cry of Fear, Dark Souls, etc.)\nCheckpoint System.... enough said\n\nNeither Pro/Con:\nVoice Acting is ok (Some bad spots, some good spots)\nAtmosphere is there for a bit (A lot of graphical, scary looking monsters are in the game but they aren't scary)\n\nExtensive Review begins here, Shorter version down bottom:\n\nTheir are 3 core things (personally for me) to making a good horror game: Gameplay (Can you scare the player?), Atmosphere (Can you provide a dreaded setting for the player?), and immersion (Can you get the player to be involved and invested into the world?). If you fail in all 3, then its not a good horror game. You can fail in 1 or 2, but not all 3. Lets start with Gameplay.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay in this game boils down to a single thing. Run from Point A to Point B, shoot some dudes or run away from some dudes. Their are too few, simple puzzles throughout the game and essentially, you'll just be running and gunning throughout. You have your same generic, cloned zombies for minions with boss fights that are similar throughout the game. They are huge, and have insta-kill moves. Its hard to feel like you have an actual health system unless you are fighting zombies. The only uniqueness in the bosses is their use of the environment and how they interact with it such as using mines or destroying hiding places. Overall, you'll just be running in a straight line from point A to Point B, shooting some zombies and moving on to the next chapter. This game takes repetition to insane levels. A lot of the boss fights are reminiscient from other games like safebox man (pyramidhead), chainsaw man (other games), generic spider boss...ughhhhhh, can we have some originality please? Checkpoint system is very poorly done alongside a saving point that is only accessed through mirrors placed throughout the game. Literally, you'll have done the parts necessary to progress, you die to those instant kill moves and you are FORCED to go through all that same part again....WHO DOES THIS ANYMORE? Come on... how does that equate to a fun experience? That is only going to cause more frustration than you want to bring to a player that is trying to enjoy the game.\n\nThe Crafting/RPG system is very small and minimal. RPG boils down to simple upgrades while crafting is just making more ammo for the crossbow.... sooo creative. They literally went sooo bloody basic on everything here, its ashame to even bother including them. Would have been better to just give set numbers. Oh, lets mess with the protagonist's head and he'll suddenly realize he can carry more ammo or sprint farther... Yes because messing with the brain increases the strength of your character and makes your weapons stronger.... not like making custom parts for weapons or other ways of crafting or including RPG elements. Nope, got to do it basic and bland way of magically making everything just work through one button press and some juicy green gel... Lame and lazy.\n\nPlot:\n\nThis plot has to be one of the worst plots I have ever experienced in a game. A lot of it is just, why are you doing this or why is this happening? None of this though is even explained until the very end where you will probably have lost any interest in caring by that point. You'll be invested to start with, then be confused for the next 14 chapters until the end where you find out that the plot is completely stupid by that point. The plot twist will make you wonder how this game even exists to begin with. A lot of the characters are very bland, uninspired and not much developed or cared for throughout the game. They will be there one chapter, then disappear for the next 5 chapters, then just die or do something stupid later for plot convenience. Honestly, just forget this game even had a plot to begin with and just continue walking in that straight line until you hit the next chapter... oooh so scary -_-.\n\nAtmosphere and immersion:\n\nA good horror game can get you involved in the game and make you fear your environments, making you dread what could be out there. This game fails at this sooo poorly with its frustrating mechanics, its horrible plot and its underdeveloped characters. Its very hard to be even involved or invested into the game when you are too busy just wanting the next chapter to just show up so you can complete the game as quickly as possible. Without investment, you aren't gonna be immersed into the game and the scary/horror parts are just gonna be huge nuisance. Overall, it has some horror elements but they are the same thing as any other horror game. Oversized humanoids, strange looking creatures, mixed-creatures like the spiderlady or Dog-looking creature.\n\nEverything Else:\n\nGraphics are pretty which is where I think all the money went. Making the game look as dazzling as ever while giving little attention to the gameplay sections. Honestly, did the developers ever play through their game and think "Hmmmm... does this equate to a fun, good gameplay?" Don't think so.\n\nShorten version (didn't realize reviews had a character limit ;_;):\n\nIf you enjoy walking down long hallways while occasionally fighting an enemy or 2 with the same tactics coughcoughFFXIIIcoughcough, that throws in random horrific looking enemys, then wait for a sale and try this game then. Otherwise, its just a very weakly developed game that should have spent more time in development to polish out those weak parts. Gameplay is just so bland and weak and the story needed better writing.\n\nRating: 5/10","April 11, 2015","false","26.3"," 106 of 204 people (52%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","52","106","204","10","5"

The characters are quite cool, and you can relate to them. The enemies are varied and with limited resources will need brains over brawn. There are some memorable nasties and a few moments that could make you jump thrown in. The graphics are nice and the sound atmospheric. Definately worth a look if you are a fan of the genre, and maybe even if not. Each chapter is fairly lengthy and there are at least 14 judging by achievements so a lot of gameplay. Also you can always try the harder modes unless you are hardcore already!","February 15, 2015","true","20.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

I have to say that it's like a mixture of RE4 and Dead space and The Last of Us somewhat. The story of this game is just baffaling and not in a good way, I have never played a game that goes in so many weird directions like this one. From start to finish this games story is as confusing as everyone says it is and believe that.\n\nI love the combat in this its always tense and makes you appreciate every weapon in the game. Because they can be unforgiving with the ammo. I also lovethe graphics, art direction, and atmosphere. I had ZERO problems with my PC and I ran the game at 50-60 frames no black bars. Itsa greatlooking game in the open areas and the zombiedesign was cool. The story was theonly minor fault.\n\nThe problem I had was with the boss battles some ranged from easy to just a restart fest. There are some levels in the game that literally throw a boss at you when youleast expect it. I learned that flight is the first option before fight unless theyu enclose you and you have to kill them. Some of the encounters seem next to impossible until you actually beat it and then wonde rhow the heck you made it out.\n\nSo if anyone is intrerested or have played RE4 and like survival horror action games then I would reccommend this to anyone plus the dlc thatis supposed to come out. Is agreat game to play and and it just gets better the second playthrough in new game plus. Wait forthe sale though. its not worth $60.","January 5, 2015","true","24.4"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Sebastian Castellanos and Ruvik were best friends in middle school, and are now attending Misato West High School together. They are assigned to the same class in their first year, but are given seats on opposite sides of the room! If that wasn't enough, it is announced at the entrance ceremony that the school will be closed in three years. This doesn't bother either of them, as they still plan on having lots of fun together during their high school years.\n\nSebastian gets jealous of Ruvik making new friends though, so the two decide to deepen their bond. "Let's do something we'd never do with other girls," Ruvik says, and they share a kiss in a vacant classroom after school one day. After that one kiss leads to many kisses, the two begin to realize that the relationship they share has changed completely. But what will happen to their relationship once a disapproving older sister begins to suspect that something is going on between the two?","April 21","true","13.1"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","9","15","4","2"

And it unfolds very very slowly.\n\nI like that the game wants to be very diverse as each chapter is a bit different in theme, gameplay and atmosphere, but some of them were just bad, especially the “kill enemies coming in waves” parts. Sometimes the game is more frustrating than frightening, but the last half makes up for all its mistakes. These last chapters are absolutely tense and creepy.

First of all, most of the technical issues described in former critics have been fixed. The game is stable, textures are okay (with one exception towards the end of the game) and the infamous black bars can be opted out from in the settings.\nThe Evil Within is a challenging, athmospheric game with good gameplay, nice visuals and varied settings, including a mental hospital, a village, sewers (yes, what's a game without sewrs?), a crumbling, modern city, an old mansion, a farm, some surreal lanscapes and many more. It's like a potpourri of survival horror sceneries and I personally never got bored of wondering what would come next. Ennemies are okay. Some people deplored bad AI but what do they expect from zombies and monsters? These guys aren't supposed to be very smart, are they? You really have to manage your scarce ammunition and search every corner for stuff to help you on your way through the incessant nightmare the main protagonist is going through and, allthough the guy is a total badass with neves of steel, the feeling of weekness never fades. There are a few very challenging boss fights and a couple of annoying ennemies, allthough they didn't annoy me so much personally.\nAll in all, I suggest very much to download the demo and see for yourself. That's what I did and I was instantly hooked.\n\nDon't expect this to be a game for you if you're only satisfied with games that give you all the shooting power you want in order to mow through hordes of ennemies. This is not the game for you. On the other hand, if like me you enjoy a game like Alien: Isolation or Half life mixed with oldschool Resident Evil, you might enjoy this game as much as I did.","January 19, 2015","true","88.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If you like survival-horror shooter/adventures I think you will have much fun with this game.

The atmopshere is tense and gloomy and very well fitting for a horror game. The story is ok, and unfolds until the end of the game with one major turning point.

The weapons are nice, I liked their handling and diversity.\n\nThe graphics are superb (don't forget to enable full-screen and reduce grain).

The zombie AI is awful, the game and combat mechanics even worse. The executioner content seemed promising at first but was even more dissapointing. You keep going through a tiny (recycled) part of the manison and fight "boss"-monster after bossmonster. It keeps going for roughly 1 hour before you are through.\n\nI give the game a recommendation because the main game was a 85-90 in my opinion.

Gaffney","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141733817/","127 products in account","I have nearly no complaints.\n\nTo start, the later previews of the game showed me that it probably wouldn't be the fantastic return of classic survival horror I'd been waiting for, and I was right (I'm a classic Resident Evil veteran; some I've beaten about twenty times).  But it can be scary.  What it does better than that I find, is tension.  It is one of the most tense games I've ever played.\n\nThe aiming system is clunky enough to feel more realistic than Resident Evil 4, though it (the game overall, and the aiming system) is in many ways similar to RE4.  Ammunition is limited but not finite the way it is in classic RE.\n\nThe game is not easy.  It is a challenge and almost never in a cheap way.\n\nThe boss fights are inventive.\n\nPsychological horror has generally not felt threatening to me.  Silent Hill would add weird sounds and disturbing images and then no-thing would happen (and conversely actual danger would come without warning).  Evil Within however, has something to back up every threat it makes.\n\nI've read some weird complaints about the level design and why would certain things be here or there.  The answer is simply that it's psychological horror.  Everything's gone mad.  The game establishes new rules of reality and then follows them, only breaking or bending them when a specific effect is desired.\n\nLastly, a couple of objective flaws:  the game ran like a slideshow on my PC initially, even with the lowest settings, and my PC has no trouble with any other game on the highest settings.  Following the patch I had no trouble whatever, so there's a good chance any complaints you've read regarding that, are outdated (or my experience would indicate so).  The other flaw is that the mechanics can at times be messy, which will cause you occasional frustration, and with this I'll lump in the worst sprinting system I've seen in a game to date.  When he runs out of stamina from running he just stands there catching his breath for ages.

Should this work? Probably not. Does it work for me? Hell yes. You can never guess what tone it's going to take next and for some strange reason I found that very compelling. I'm not sure if the game was designed that way to appeal to people who want Action games and people who want something that feels like a classic "Survival Horror" game, but in the end it's a mess I would not want changed.\n\nGameplay:\nI don't even know where to begin. First they tell you about stealth and throw you into a small room where you're getting hunted. Then they tell you about stealth kills and throw you into a large rural town map with very little ammo and force you to set traps, use one time use insta-kill melee weapons, and stealth kill a large portion of roaming guard enemies to explore and get by. (If you've ever played The Last of Us you will understand these mechanics immediately. They are pretty much 1:1 copies of the gameplay but slightly jankier.) Then you get thrown into the real meat of the game design which is small semi-linear corridor style environments with light puzzle elements and a handful of ways to navigate along with just enough supplies to get by as long as you're taking advantage of the minimal stealth elements and environmental traps.\n\nThis is barring the strange gameplay shifts. There are times the game wants to be full action shooter and throws you into arena set pieces with tons of enemies who will eat your ammo like it's nothing. Then there are times where you're forced into fantastic thriller puzzle-chase sections where you're outrunning an immortal enemy and have to figure out how to beat them while being chased. There are open locations where you have to navigate your way around a relatively large zone with minimal enemies that requires a puzzle to get across. Finally there will be times when you're in tight caves/buildings/horror locale cliche that require quick thinking, hiding, and planning in order to get past the enemies without dying or using up your limited ammo.\n\nAlong with this you also collect green-juice used to upgrade skills like being able to sprint longer, carry more items, do more damage, heal more, etc.  Just another element that I found really strange and thought I wouldn't like but really enjoyed even if some of the upgrades are pretty damn useless or shouldn't be upgrades. (3 Seconds of sprinting base!? Really!?).\n\nStory:\nThe story makes no sense. Even when it makes sense it doesn't really make sense. Also there isn't a single likable character in this game. That's about all I have to say.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you want a Modern style horror shooter then this is the game you are looking for. Fantastic in it's design, gameplay, and set-pieces. If you want an old-school style "barely clinging onto life and hoping to god for a save soon" style survival horror game laden with puzzles then look elsewhere.","February 15","true","26.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It features clunky combat and heavy atmosphere.\n\nA lot of people seemed to complain that the story was too illogical and that the protagonist was cliche, but I didn't have a problem with it personally.  I felt that it all worked pretty well.\n\nWith most horror games, I usually ask the question: is this game spooky, and can it keep me engaged?  The answer here is a definitive yes.  It is firmly an action horror, as you can fight back, but there are many fights you have where you aren't able to outright kill certain creatures.  You have to find other means in the environment to keep them at bay while you are running away.\n\nThese moments are tense and terrifying especially when you lose sight of those creatures and you can still hear them.\n\nI have to give kudos to the developers for the top-notch quality for the entire game - the environments are believably dirty, run-down and gross.  The sounds and music are critical to horror games.  These are also top notch.\n\nSo while I can't totally recommend this game at it's full price, if you do see it on a discount, and you are a hardcore horror fan as I am, you should get it right away.  Although it has its flaws, it is still a solid must-play entry into the AAA horror genre.\n\nRating: 7.5/10 Brains\n","March 14, 2015","true","24.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I recall climbing a tree in our parent's front yard and a multicolored parachute in elementary gym class. I remember a wide ruled piece of paper that contained a an elaborate space battle that lived more honestly in the realm of emotion than it did in any actual form of artistic ability. For whatever it was worth, these brief inconsequential moments of time have been permanently etched into neurons eschewing anything of actual importance, like calculus or atomic theory. What if we could tap into this potential of the human brain, teasing out the lucid moments of our deepest dreams and laying them bare before us like some sort of workshop of the mind.\n\nSo you can imagine my delight when I heard about THE EVIL WITHIN by the spiritual creator of Castlevania. When Sebastian Constampalous, a stoic man of Greek heritage too proud to lean on his church for emotional support, learns that an evil mental hospital has been conducting evil experiments with evil machines that can recreate memories and dreamscapes over wi-fi signals, I felt a certain resonance, as if the developers had somehow tapped into my psyche directly via some proto-manifestation of this terrible engine. It tickled the imagination. If I could go back in time and revise the awkward sexual encounters of my youth, I wondered, refining them and iterating upon them endlessly in some Murray-esque Groundhog Day scenario, what would I become. What would we ALL become.\n\nThe answer may chill you to the bone.","May 30, 2015","true","90.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

Do not underestimate these zombies cause they are harder than the ones in resident evil... they are vicious and deadly within a few hits. This game is all about being smart and stealthy, and most of all conserving your ammunition. Every bullet in this one counts. As of this game being scary?

However, upon getting into it, I got more and more disappointed.\n\nThe Difficulty: This games doesn't really feel too difficult on it's own, it has it's moments but nothing unbeatable, but the sheer banality of it is what started to wear on me. It felt like I'd seen al this before and seen it done better.\n\nGraphics: The graphics were good, but again the enemy designs and other things didn't particularly impress me.\n\nSound: The sound quality didn't do much for me, I found myself going on auto pilot way more often than I should've. Tension was just not there.\n\nGameplay: This is what killed it for me. I don't mind the idea of having to use traps or anything of that nature, I prefer the idea of survival horror as being SURVIVAL horror, not FPS. That said, this game started to get incredibly dull and repetative when the trap mechanics were being used so dreadfully often that even taking down bosses felt more like a rince and repeat rather than actually surviving the battle. There were more dull moments than I could count, which leads me to my next point\n\nThe Story: Bland. Boring, Uneventful. I knew what the ending would be long before I finished the game.\n\nControls: They work most of the time, but there's other times you find yourself in a situation where it's extremely difficult to do one simple task like pulling a lever under fire or even turning around to pick something up. Vexing at best.\n\nOverall: I wouldn't pay full price for this at all. If you want to try it, play a demo or soemthing so you know if you can overlook these issues.

I have loved horror games since I played the first Silent Hill, back in the 90s, however, few, if any, horror games lived up to that experience. For me, this game has come the closest.\n\nWhile I wasn’t actually scared playing The Evil Within, the tension this game produces is unreal, especially on the levels with ‘invisible creatures’. I’m playing through again on the ‘Nightmare’ setting now and the tension is magnified greatly.\nThrough chapter three I wasn’t impressed with the graphics, but after that I was quite impressed. There are lots of details to look at (yes, at times, they just pop in) and they are grimy details at that- very Silent Hill-ish, if Silent Hill’s settings were doused in blood that is. Also, the shadows freaked me out a number of times… Wtf was that?... Oh jees, it was the shadow from that chair… As I said, ‘ tense’.\n\nThe sounds are great as well and they darkly fit the mood of the game.\n\nThe check-point placement seems to be a bit odd at times. Some check points are mere feet apart, while others can cause a great deal to be repeated upon death. Some frustrations aside, the check-points usually are placed after something significant has happened, e.g. making it through a section of a chapter.\n\nI recommend the game. I can’t remember the last time I felt like replaying a game so close to when I completed it, so they must have done something right.\n","October 29, 2014","true","98.4"," 30 of 57 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","30","57","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsythe/recommended/268050/","dsythe","Deathsythe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dsythe/","173 products in account","The Evil Within is perhaps one of the best third person survival horror games in years. The game feels very much like a natural extension of Mikami’s Resident Evil 4, mainly focusing on tense encounters while managing a limited set of resources. Not content to be a simple retread, The Evil Within also goes some way into subverting and challenging many of the conventions set up by Resident Evil 4.\n\nMost strikingly, The Evil Within rarely lets the player feel “safe”. Many of the moves in the game offer little to no invincible frames; the player may be hit out of a stealth kill or trying to burn a downed enemy at almost any time. Gone is the relatively safe pattern of shooting an enemy in the kneecap then running up and suplexing him into his buddies found in Resident Evil 4. Instead the player must use caution in just about every part of a combat situation. This also applies to hit animations; at least once this reviewer was caught in a stun animation from a trap explosion only to fall into a boss’ instant kill move.\n\nThe feeling of vulnerability extends to the player’s movement. Whereas Resident Evil 6 may have perfected movement mechanics in terms of player empowerment (perhaps too much so), the Evil Within keeps the player purposefully limited. Sebastian can only sprint in a limited duration, before upgrades, and exhausting his endurance meter leaves him winded and vulnerable. Similarly, there is no dodge mechanic. In addition, melee (before acquiring an unlockable item) is largely unsuitable for kills. This further forces the player to manage encounters in a more thoughtful manner than rolling around and chaining melee combos.\n\nItems tend to be scarce within in the game. Even if the player finds themselves with a surplus through stealth killing their way through a chapter, a particularly rough, or botched, encounter may find them strapped for resources. The Evil Within manages to make missed shots feel painful in a way very few recent games have. This is reinforced by the fact that Sebastian is no crack shot; even fully upgraded his aim has a sway that demands the player slow themselves a bit to ensure each bullet hits its mark.  Sebastian also tends to be fragile; making each syringe count. Medkits are also available, in limited supply (the first play through provided perhaps only five or six), but the use of one puts Sebastian in a delirious, defenseless, state.\n\nThe Evil Within also delivers atmosphere in spades. The entire game has the feel of an ever shifting nightmare. Horrific traps, a village reminiscent of Resident Evil 4, a homage to the mansion in the original Resident Evil, and bizzarely twisted cityscapes are some of the vistas awaiting the player. Given the constantly changing landscape the player is always given a different set of challenges. The positive side being that if one happened to dislike something in a chapter the chances of seeing it again are slim to none; The Evil Within is rarely in the habit of repeating itself.\n\nThe Agony Crossbow is a weapon that deserves special mention. While each weapon in the game looks, sounds, and handles superbly with satisfying gore effects the crossbow brings something special to the equation. Each weapon has a place and fits a roll, the Agony Crossbow, with its selection of bolts, gives the player a multitude of options. If unsure of a situation the crossbow is often the way to go, from setting traps, stunning enemies or simple raw firepower the weapon has an answer even if bolts are painfully limited.\n\nThe story may feel a bit disjointed and vague. That said it does feel very intentional. The model viewer, available after beating the game, in particular offers some insight into just what all the creatures happen to be. The player is never spoon-fed anything (no information dumps, bright glowing arrows, or so on). Rather, the feeling of bewilderment seems completely intended. The game mechanics also put quite a bit of faith in the player’s intelligence which is satisfying given the current trend in games. What may have seen like trial and error deaths were likely completely avoidable if one were paying attention; the clues simply weren’t painted in neon.\n\nThe game isn’t without issues. It is susceptible to crashes (the ones this reviewer ran into where exclusive to chapters three and four and seemingly random). In addition, pre-patch, the game was limited to thirty frames per second and black bars. During this play through I favored sixty frames per second with the black bars, to play as closely to Mikami’s vision as possible (I also rather liked them after a time). The Evil Within features some rough spots as it clearly did not enjoy the budget or time Mikami had with Resident Evil 4. That said, it is still an excellent survival horror game; perhaps one of the best examples of third person horror in years. Well worth the time and money.\n","December 14, 2014","true","29.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

From the mind of Shinji Mikami (so you know it's going to be crazy!)  Wiki him if you don't know who he is, has a long list of games to his name.  The title of the game should be a pretty big hint at what type of game this is.  I haven't played Silent Hill but I think it's more of a Silent Hill game than Resident Evil.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game, I'm going to break it down:\nStory: Erm, well this is sort of hard.  This is probably the weakest part for me.  I feel like you have to connect a lot of dots to figure out what's going on.  I read some impressions from other people after I finished it that helped me do that.  Neat story, but could have been done better I think.  Have more tape recordings (are found during the game) or something to give a little more back story.\n\nGameplay: I play games like this in a really percise manner.  Enemies at the start won't die by a single head shot, there can be hidden enemies, there are traps all around and your ammo is limited.  Therefore I go through pretty slow, used stealth as much as I could (stealth kills are 1 hit KO) and thought stuff out a lot as I went to be as efficient as I could be.  You have a number of weapons that you upgrade through the game, the gunplay is very good as is using stealth.  My first play through was ~15 hours w/ 33 deaths, even being percise you will die a lot!\n\nAudio/Video: Graphics are fantastic (using an i5/780).  There were some perfomrance issues when it first came out but a few patches in on the PC version have fixed a lot of issues and made performance a lot better.  The game tries to unhinge you.  They'll be lots of blood, eerie sounds and what not.  The name of the game is Evil Within, you should expect this!  The game isn't really scary, there are a few jump scares, but it's very tense.\n\nOther: First time through I unlocked some new weapons and they gave me a lot of green gel to level up skills if I want to go back in so it seems like there is good replay value (similar to RE4) if you like the game.  If you like Mikami games, horror games, or a good 3rd person shooting game (with crazy/horror/weird style)I would say it's worth a play through!","December 12, 2014","true","21.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The most important thing to note is that this game is action first and horror second. Very reminiscent of Resident Evil 4. If you're looking for something to scare you, I don't 100% recommend The Evil Within. Its scares taper off after the first couple of chapters (by that point you'll have upgraded enough to blow everything in front of you to shreds). But if you want a Resident Evil 4-esque action hybrid, you won't be disappointed.\n\nExtended Thoughts and Ranting Here -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gWLBPir798","July 5, 2015","true","44.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

First on the launch it had 30 FPS lock and Black bar problem, and with latest patch it's fixed, thank god. But , still the game lots of good points and lots of bad points.\nStarting with good points, when Shinji Mikami wants it, he gives you good taste of horror with game's ambient, unknown psyhological stuff and abominations that haunt you and make you suffer both physically and mentally. What made me wanna finish this game, is that I had to record for my channel, my curiosity for the ending and that I wanted to see both Ruvik and Joseph suffering. I had fun in boss fights, such as Luna , The Keeper etc. They were not like Re4's head-on combat, but hide'N Seek, save your bullets and run for your life , combat. And last but not least, the ambient, the areas of the game were quite interresting. You would have no idea where you'll end up in next chapter or even after some minutes. And in every corner, there is a trap that wants to say hello to you! Beware.\nBad Points? A lot.First of all, I hated and raged a lot during Chapter 11-12-13 . Why ? Cause this fricking game turns into CoD Evil Warfare. Monsters attacking you with Heavy Machine Guns, Smg's and Molotovs. I am sorry but , this not how a survival horror game supposed to be. I am sorry , but this is where ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan. I was really enjoying the dark ambient of The Evil Within, then game threw me somewhere, where I stand on a lift and all of those monster were throwing molotovs at me and shooting like 12 year old CoD Player. Thats when I was fed up with this game and Mikami's love of Zombie-using-SMGs. That's easy, cheap and disgusting and I am sorry , but not survival horror game.\nI would recommend you to buy this game, only on it's sale or you really really really like Resident Evil 4. For Horror game lovers, this game is not meant to be guys, I am sorry.\n\nBut still, 10/10 would curse to Joseph and Shinji Mikami while playing, with joy.","November 3, 2014","true","22.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

The Evil Within is a real sequel for you.\n- Enjoyable, deep and exciting gunplay.\n- Surprising Element throughout gameplay. Not a shallow gameplay.\n- Great and very detailed atmosphere.\n- Mostly Residnet Evil 4's style(Same Creator of Resident 1-4) plus Silent Hill feeling mixed up in this game.\n- The 30fps of game is becuase director of this game want player to experience the game in this way but not because they can'y make the game runs on more fps.\n- Black bar is same reason as 30fps.\n- I love Jill Valentine and Julie Kidman, Woman protagonist in this game reminds me of her :D\nThe summary : This game isn't a game that create for milking money. It has style and intension to create a great gaming experience. A lot of efforts had put into this game and the result is a game that is just as good as Resident Evil 1-4 to be honest and this game really have that replayability for me.

After a patch, you can turn 60 FPS on, disable border. Best get rid of motion blur as well. It's playable in the game that way, unless you try using more AA than the cheap console FXAA (AA wannabe more like), otherwise FPS drop down horribly.\n\nIn the actual game, the controlls feel ok - and that's what is important.\nThe game, while not terribly scary, does create a constant feel of suspense. Beeing carefull is what this game is about.\nI wouldn't even touch the casual mode, survival is not that hard anyway, so if you are wondering which to start on - don't :)\n\nGame is heavily story-based, it is not open, but rather a series of corridors/pathways with bigger areas you can explore from most angles. Despite beeing a horror game, you kill a lot of enemies here. All the pickups are capped pretty low before you upgrade them, so you can't exactly go trigger happy. Instead, you sneak kill as much as you can. While avoiding is possible, it doesn't really pay off.\nUpgrades are made thanks to the green goo you collect. Weapons, ammo capacity, health, sprint - that kind of things.\n\nGraphics are not the most spectacular, but than again - better than Resident Evil 6 for example.\n\nOverall a good game.

But I'd like to say that so far, this has been one of the most horryfying game experiences I've experienced ever. For me the start was kinda dull and lame (except the chainsaw chase), and the story seemed pretty generic and bland to begin with. But suddenly stuff starts to happen all the time, the game just gets worse and gives you less time to recover.\n\nThere are also several interesting enemies with cool (although a bit over the top gory) models. I'd like to say that Laura is the worst thing I've ever layed my eyes upon. The gameplay is also fun and interesting, although it can be repetive in some cases. The atmosphere is perfect, the music/sound effects is also very good!\n\nI'd recommend this game for you if you're able to see past this games' technical flaws (some of them can almost be fully fixed using commands) and if you like to get stressed/anxious 24/7. Some stuff in here might be cheesy as hell, but whatever, it's a lot scarier than Outlast in my opinion. And don't even get me started on how this game bends reality and messes up your brain.\n\nThough I have to say that I've never played any RE or SH game myself, so maybe this terrifies me so much because it's a new experience for me. Neither did I follow this game's development for long. I found out the day before it released that ''HEY this looks cool in a messed up way!''\n\nPlease remember that this is my opinion, and I haven't finished the game yet.\n\nGuns does not equal safe  (especially not if Laura is after you!)","October 15, 2014","true","16.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

As for mechanics I would probably give it a 4/5 out of 10 as there are some parts that kill the immersion such as if you are on a platform and go too far near the edge your character spazzes out to the point where all you hear is him jacking off. As for price I don’t think this is worth the £34 or $60 but when this goes on sale horror fans are goanna love it, nothing is new enough to warrant the game being full price.

They did it again... T.T)they are not only doing the Happy trigger part in your face but they can also try to take cover or closing and flanking your position as other Melee type of Zombie try to kill you.This part was also so Satisfying that you have to think before you pull the trigger.Also I want to mention that this game Is A Survival Horror that Revive the old classic nostalgia Survival Horror games when the Enemies are so Punishing and Death comes in every corner,Zombies melee hit is so Damaging to your Character health no matter how far is your Upgrade for your Health bar and Zombie grapples is so hurts that it looks like Classic Resident Evil games when no matter how hard you can do button mashing to release yourself from the zombie when the Zombie catches you and grab you it will always cost you a lots of HP because Button mashing in this game is unlike Modern Resident Evil that if you push the button so Hard you will released faster and kill the enemies right away,Attention Action Horror games player : You can't do this! in this game... ><;\n\nCons :as this is a new modern Survival Horror games,No wonder they try to put so Many Action parts in The game as you try to figure it out maybe this is A Pure Survival Horror games(No it isn't Sorry... T.T)also Silly partner Joseph sequence that sometimes He is really Helping you and the other time He is Bothering you lol XD\nand a So dissapointed part that well Towards the game Ending it turns into A funny Action games all over again with its Copy paste from another Action Horror games like Silly Resident Evil 6 because(Don't read if you hasn't finished the game(Turret sequence by using A floating Minigun in a Humvee XD) its The Evil Within Developer xD\n\nPro :I was so wondering what should I wrote later for This game review as this game isn't that much of a Horror like Amnesia or Alien : Isolation that contains a lots of Scary moments and Jumpscares but I found out later during my time playing this game that 2 of The boss fight who first is Laura and The Keeper they makes this game so much of a Nightmare,as The Evil Within the main core of the Game is Them.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364672278\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=364672151\nThere is not much of Jumpscares and so Scary Horror moments that you will not predict in a 5 Miles away.\nbut the Survival part,The Gameplay and The Horror when you chased by those 2 Bosses and How to Defeat them,Well you can guess that this Game has almost the same Feelings you experienced when you play Resident Evil 3 and Meet your friendly neighbourhood Nemesis... T.T\n\nConclusionMikami~ Please give us a New Sequel with More Action,Explosions,Confusing story,Silly progression towards Ending XDHorror and Jumpscares XDand Keep up the good work~ ;)","December 28, 2014","true","43.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

However I cannot recommend it . This game is brutally difficult. Don’t get me wrong I’m all for a challenge, but when I sit down to play a game I want something that’s fun and fulfilling, not an experience that leaves me ripping my hair out and wanting to quit. Being forced to run from invincible enemies through an entire level is not a fun gameplay mechanic and if it weren’t for the obnoxious number of times which I’m forced to do so, I might actually enjoy the game. In fact when I’m not fleeing from my undefeatable enemy I am enjoying myself.  Searching through the creepy and very well done level design for ammo, collectables and keys for upgrades is a very fun experience. But it all goes down the tube when u face off against an enemy which you simply cannot defeat. It leaves you feeling like all the upgrades and perks where for nothing because now you’re forced to run away regardless of how much experience you dumped into your health bar.\nI understand that the invincible enemy is supposed to be scary, u cant kill it so u have to think your way around them instead of going in bullets blazing. However the game simply dose it far too often. It becomes tedious, frustrating and boring.  Once again, I cannot recommend this game.\n","December 24, 2014","false","13.5"," 83 of 162 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","83","162","0","8"

We have played a good few hours together now and I have concluded that the game is somewhat enjoyable. Not because it's a good game, however, but because it is absolutely hilarious to witness such sh*t.\n\nThe story:\n\nAbsolutely ridiculous story with incredibly boring characters. At the beginning of the game, after visiting an asylum, you leave to find what looks like the beginning of an apocalypse. Buildings are on fire and sh*t and there is even one of those giant cracks in the earth (I have no idea what they're called, but its used in loads of those stupid action/thriller movies). The story is just so far fetched that I assume the entire story happened in his imagination (I am yet to finish the game). Nevertheless, the devastatingly bad story does have its advantage as it provides several hilarious and cringy moments for you to laugh at.\n\nThe voice acting:\n\nAll of the voice acting is atrocious and extremely bland. There is no character development at all and the character you play as sounds way too calm, considering the situation. Also, the script is extremely amusing because it is, like the story, awful.\n\nThe gameplay:\n\nYour character, despite being in the police force and, therefore, having completed demanding physical endurance tests, can run for about 2 seconds before stopping to catch a breather. Literally 2 seconds. This is not an exaggeration. However, fortunately for him, he can teleport through magic mirrors that take him to a hospital ward with an electric chair that injects green sh*t into his brain. He willingly chooses to take part in this process. After all, this injection of green filth directly into the brain can produce additional clothing pockets that can store extra ammo. Also, his stamina can be increased so that he can run for a remarkable 4 or 5 seconds without stopping.\n\nIn addition to this, the combat is appalling. Did you know that you can shoot half of an enemy's brain out with a weapon of your choice and he will continue to show signs of perfect cognitive ability. Well... I take that back. At times the enemies will run straight past you and stand around in a corner for a while. Also, the melee combat with bare fists consists of punching the enemy twice, then running away as he swings a really powerful backhander at you. Rinse and repeat that process about 3 or 4 times and you kill him.\n\nConclusion:\n\nA bad game that's only real positive aspect is the comedy that can be found in its flaws.","April 20, 2015","false","8.0"," 85 of 166 people (51%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","51","85","166","17","10"

It's tense. Yes, it's kinda badly optimized, but with a decent system you'll be fine.\n\nI'm currently at chapter 6 and so far I've had a LOT of fun. The Evil Within is not a bad game. All these people complaining about the 30fps lock and aspect ratio are stupid. You can fix both of these issues very easily.  It's a tense, gory and creepy survival horror game. It feels like Resident Evil, but IMO it's way harder than any of the 3rd person RE games. Ammo in this game is scarce, so that builds the tension when you're in the middle of a fight and you're running out of bullets. There are also some of those "run for your life" moments which I love. The story is kind of interesting so far, but since I haven't finished the game, I won't put that in the review. So far this game is a 9/10 for me.

It's not a graphical achievment by any means, but it is a beautiful game with an interesting art style that (to me) screams "Bethesda". The gameplay is half stealth/sneak and half action/shoot-em-up. You can really see inspirations from Resident Evil 4 and Silent Hill in this game. I also got a vibe of ps3's The Last of Us, minus the great acting and great hand to hand combat system. The Evil Within has a decent story but you really don't start hearing anything about where you are or what you are doing until past the half way point in the game. Once you get there though you get a good idea of what's going on, and it's a pretty cool concept.\nThe game runs smoothly but unfortunatley has no support (or any signs of upcoming support) for muilti-GPU configurations so I would recommend having a high end single GPU for ultra graphics. If not though your probably only missing out on better shadow/reflection effects.This game also features a very unusal widescreen aspect ratio which puts two big black bars on the top and bottom of the screen. This can be altered by hitting the "insert" button and typing the following:\nR_forceaspectratio 1.88\nAlso to unlock the frame rate:\nR_swapinterval 0\nUsing these console commands will make the game look much more normal and you'll be having fun in no time. Forewarning though, for me, I cannot get achievements while doing this and I know some people figured out how to get around that, I just don't really care about them.\n\nThe enviornments are awesome and creepy and well done. The combat/weapon system is good. The melee combat works but isn't great. The boss fights are super fun and the AI is pretty damn good. Finally, my best advice to give you is save your ammo.\n\n8/10 -Grim.","October 27, 2014","true","31.6"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","26","50","0","0"

The main story though is nuts and ends up working like some horror version of Inception so more than made up for it.\nIt's definately one of those 'is this reality or a dream' styled affairs. My only other gripe is that some 'bosses' were overused at points and were plain irritating.\n\nNuts and bolts wise, game ran silky smooth at full whack (1920x1080) controls never felt like they were letting me down, mouse and keyboard all the way through was no issues at all or alternative xbox controller setup is available. Music and overall sound effects were sublime at points, there are quite a few 'story' bits you wander through and the sound/music was really atmospheric. Game length was pitched about right, not too long as it would get boring or too short that you thought 'where did the game go'.\n\nIf you like the things I've mentioned, go for it - worth every penny and I'm seriously weight up a second playthrough and if a sequel appears it will be on my wishlist faster than you can see drilled nail into the frontal lobe of the brain on a live subject to drain blood from a machine and open up a weird multi locking door in a haunted mansion.

Granted, the original Japanese voice work could very well be a nuanced, or at the very least, passable affair. Not being a Japanese language speaker, this is sadly a perspective I'll never be privy to.\n\nThat said, Evil Within's [english language] voice work is almost a non-issue, as the piece's tonal strengths and atmosphere are masterfully delivered through a slavish devotion to aural and visual craftsmanship. The lighting is incredibly dynamic, shifting and warping organically. The same can be said about EW's soundscape; whether it be the nerve-rattling soundtrack or near unbearable haunts of silence, the game's phonic presence lends itself perfectly to the nightmarish journey at hand.\n\nGameplay-wise, anyone familiar with the likes of Resident Evil 4 and beyond will be right at home. Shinji Mikami and Co. once again struck a near perfect balance between keeping the game's mechanics tight and enjoyable, while never giving the player enough breathing room to ever feel comfortable or overpowered. Resource management is crucial, especially on the harder difficulties.\n\nI found the game optimization reasonable (infuriating launch-day shortfalls notwithstanding). Rigged with 2 Nvidia 680M's and an Intel i7 3940xm (3.9ghz OC'ed), the game ran fairly smooth at 30fps at Ultra settings. However, removing the letterbox, which adds an additional 30% of screen real estate to the GPU's workload, caused noticable lag spikes. I recommend anyone facing performance inconsistencies to utilize  Nvidia Inspector and its extensive array of customization options and game profiles.\n\nHighly recommend to any fan of survival horror gameplay with an action-centric slant. A small measure of RPG-based character modification also adds to the game's tension, encouraging the player to trail off the beaten path, in hopes of collecting the ever precious "Green Gel" (the game's version of upgrade currency).","February 15, 2015","true","37.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lancobus/recommended/268050/","Lancobus","James","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lancobus/","492 products in account","The Evil Within is one of the most frustrating and also most rewarding horror games to hit the PC since the dawn of time. When the game first came out, I absolutely hated it and if I reviewed it then, I'd have never recommended people buy it, let alone play it. However, multiple patches later, 60fps and removal of the black bars opened up a gaming experience which is the closest thing to Resident Evil 4 that you can get so far.\n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, the first 3 chapters are a bit lack luster, with annoyingly forced scenes where you have to flee, mixed with the TERRIBLE accuracy of the starting weapon, the pistol. This leads to a very frustrating experience, as mentioned previously. The lack of ammo (its a survival horror so this is expected) would be fine if the pistol didn't have a 5 degree cone of accuracy on it to start with, which means you never get rewarded for accuracy. This takes a lot of skill away from the player sadly, which lets the game down.\n\nHOWEVER, chapter 4 onwards is like playing a different game. The first real horror experience for me was in chapter 4 with "Laura", who is the best and worst of Japanese horror cliches merged into one creature. The game then sets you up right after that moment with an equally bad part, literally throwing you out of the hot frying pan and into the fire. This is the pace the game then continues with for the majority of its 15 chapters.\n\nPROS\n+ closest game to Resident Evil 4 in terms of approach and style\n+ Interesting story\n+ nice setting\n+ impressive visuals\n+ genuinely hard encounters\n+ INSANE level of difficulty if you're brave enough...\n\nCONS\n- Still needs a very powerful machine to run it properly\n- "Boss" creatures aren't explained and you have to repeatedly die whilst learning their mechanics\n- Storyline isn't explained at all, instead it was left for the DLC!!!\n- Pistol accuracy is an absolute disgrace and even after 5/5 maxing out, it still has a 2.5 degree cone...\n- Matches mechanic seems to fall by the wayside the further you get into the game, especially after Laura.\n- Some chapters are vastly longer than others for no apparent reason, almost like they were developed by different departments.\n\nSee my entire playthrough here on my channel if you so wish!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGiYSiI3wiNnMzIZkzm1JnK4W_dZ1cI7G","August 8, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Besides being attacked and having to kill off the undead, the are many opportunities to explore the surroundings, disarm traps, and pick up loot. The narrative is also quite disturbing and immerses you into a world of blood, torture, and death.

It is plenty scary with some of the most disturbing design I have ever seen! But almost anything you see you can eventually blow up, stealth kill, or just outright shoot and beat to death which for me makes it not as scary, but for others that will probably make it scarier, knowing that running will not always be an option and you will have to look the weird vault man in the face and kill it yourself, whether with grenades or with a pathetic pistol whip. Either way, get ready to look at some truly terrible stuff if you buy the game, it is worth the time.","July 4, 2015","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just really freaking love it. It's the kind of game that I would play it over and over again so many times without getting bored. Shinji Mikami's still in his top form. No doubt.\n\nAt first, you may find the plot is kinda ridiculous. It'll give you the "wtf" moment for some time. But as you progress more and more into the story. You'll find it really interesting and it'll make your curiosity runs high, This game doesn't tell the plot directly or obviously. But instead, they scatter it like a piece of jigsaw all over the game as a collectible stuffs like police badges, files, audiotape, newspaper, missing person posters. etc. So if you really want to fully understand the plot, you'll have to do a little bit of exploring which really is worth your time as they did a very good job on the scenery designing.\n\nFor me, personally. This game is not really that scary (part of it because i really love horror movies and games  and I've seen so many creepy ♥♥♥♥ that I have this immunity to horror stuff) Not many jumpscares. There are only a few bosses that really sent the shiver down my spine which is , of course, Laura. Typical long hair creppy looking chick. This ♥♥♥♥♥ really did got me when I first encountered her. Screaming in high-pitched voice and chased the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nI consider this game more like a psychological horror survival game. Cause the storyline really ♥♥♥♥ with your mind. Warping from places to places. Encountering a really wtf monster and stuff. And have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what the hell is going on. If you compare it as a movie. It would be a Eli Roth's movie mixed with David Fincher's movie. Eli Roth for the gore and gruesomeness and David Fincher for the psychological and disturbing elements.\n\nSo If you're a horror fan. I don't think you should miss this one. Would definitely recommend it.","January 31, 2015","true","41.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

He needs to unravel the elaborate mind-bending mystery of a small village because...uh...all part of the job.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe beginning of the game was, I suspect, heavily influenced by Resident Evil 4. The experiences are cut and paste. Things get shaken up later on, though. Minus points for originality, I'm satisfied with the gameplay. I am beginning to wonder if we're trying too hard to depict horrible parodies of human life. After a certain point, it becomes ridiculous.\n\nStory:\n\nAt first, this story made me downright angry. Early game, there are many moments that it fails to capitalize on, narratively speaking. Early on, the story fails to provide stable footing. We aren't able to orient ourselves until much later in the game. Characters make strange decisions for seemingly no reason. Many of them respond to the hideous events in strange ways. Expect liberal amounts of deus ex machina to move the plot along.\n\nThat said, the antagonist's story does get more interesting. Once you begin to understand which events are "real" and which are not, you can begin putting pieces together, and understanding the logistics of what's happening. Unfortunately, many questions will remain unanswered.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThe protagonist alternates between silence, and cursing. You'll seldom hear more from him than, "♥♥♥♥."\nOh, is that giant, nightmarish monstrosity in your way, Sebastian?\n\nDon't mind Seb. Abominations of humanity irk him.\n\nHe seems more annoyed by his enemies than genuinely threatened. This is one reason the game isn't scary; the character isn't even scared. To be fair, none of the characters are interesting early-game. Two characters are not necessary. The villain grew on me. The attempt at pseudo-psychology felt a little lazy, but eventually I was so eager to understand what was happening, I quit worrying about it. The ending, though, was not exactly mind-blowing. I got the gist of what happened.\n\nGiven the fun gameplay, I recommend it. However, horror fans who've played the Resident Evils, The Silent Hills, and Amnesia (And seen any number of horror films) will be neither surprised nor frightened by anything here. One or two enemy types are  interesting, but by and large they're nothing new. On a good note, many enemies do require some sort of strategy to deal with; they don't go down easily. Boss fights in particular are fun, though will involve just a bit of trial and error. There is definitely some fun to be had here, even with the bland story, and of course, players new to the horror genre will most suitably be made to vomit and/or have nightmares.\n\nRecommended, with caveats.","June 21, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No doubt.\n\nAt first, you may find the plot is kinda ridiculous. It'll give you the "wtf" moment for some time. But as you progress more and more into the story. You'll find it really interesting and it'll make your curiosity runs high, This game doesn't tell the plot directly or obviously. But instead, they scatter it like a piece of jigsaw all over the game as a collectible stuffs like police badges, files, audiotape, newspaper, missing person posters. etc. So if you really want to fully understand the plot, you'll have to do a little bit of exploring which really is worth your time as they did a very good job on the scenery designing.\n\nFor me, personally. This game is not really that scary (part of it because i really love horror movies and games  and I've seen so many creepy ♥♥♥♥ that I have this immunity to horror stuff) Not many jumpscares. There are only a few bosses that really sent the shiver down my spine which is , of course, Laura. Typical long hair creppy looking chick. This ♥♥♥♥♥ really did got me when I first encountered her. Screaming in high-pitched voice and chased the ♥♥♥♥ out of me.\n\nI consider this game more like a psychological horror survival game. Cause the storyline really ♥♥♥♥ with your mind. Warping from places to places. Encountering a really wtf monster and stuff. And have no ♥♥♥♥ing clue what the hell is going on. If you compare it as a movie. It would be a Eli Roth's movie mixed with David Fincher's movie. Eli Roth for the gore and gruesomeness and David Fincher for the psychological and disturbing elements.\n\nSo If you're a horror fan. I don't think you should miss this one. Would definitely recommend it.","January 31, 2015","true","41.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Takes a kind of silent hill twist part way in.  Just the right level of difficulty on survival mode with an option to run through the game again on easy mode to pick up those pesky achievements!\n\nI don't expect much of a scare from games anymore as im fairly desensitised but the bosses were creepy and at times things did make me jump.  Towards the end it becomes less scary and more concerning as you run our of ammo and start facing multiple enemies in quick succession.  It also results in the game being a lot less fun and before you know it you are just racing for the finish line!\n\n7/10 only because I feel it fell a bit short and became repetative in the second half of the game.

When the game first came out, I absolutely hated it and if I reviewed it then, I'd have never recommended people buy it, let alone play it. However, multiple patches later, 60fps and removal of the black bars opened up a gaming experience which is the closest thing to Resident Evil 4 that you can get so far.\n\nHaving said that, in my opinion, the first 3 chapters are a bit lack luster, with annoyingly forced scenes where you have to flee, mixed with the TERRIBLE accuracy of the starting weapon, the pistol. This leads to a very frustrating experience, as mentioned previously. The lack of ammo (its a survival horror so this is expected) would be fine if the pistol didn't have a 5 degree cone of accuracy on it to start with, which means you never get rewarded for accuracy. This takes a lot of skill away from the player sadly, which lets the game down.\n\nHOWEVER, chapter 4 onwards is like playing a different game. The first real horror experience for me was in chapter 4 with "Laura", who is the best and worst of Japanese horror cliches merged into one creature. The game then sets you up right after that moment with an equally bad part, literally throwing you out of the hot frying pan and into the fire. This is the pace the game then continues with for the majority of its 15 chapters.\n\nPROS\n+ closest game to Resident Evil 4 in terms of approach and style\n+ Interesting story\n+ nice setting\n+ impressive visuals\n+ genuinely hard encounters\n+ INSANE level of difficulty if you're brave enough...\n\nCONS\n- Still needs a very powerful machine to run it properly\n- "Boss" creatures aren't explained and you have to repeatedly die whilst learning their mechanics\n- Storyline isn't explained at all, instead it was left for the DLC!!!\n- Pistol accuracy is an absolute disgrace and even after 5/5 maxing out, it still has a 2.5 degree cone...\n- Matches mechanic seems to fall by the wayside the further you get into the game, especially after Laura.\n- Some chapters are vastly longer than others for no apparent reason, almost like they were developed by different departments.\n\nSee my entire playthrough here on my channel if you so wish!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGiYSiI3wiNnMzIZkzm1JnK4W_dZ1cI7G","August 8, 2015","true","18.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is awesome  i love the artwork and the ideas behind it, it is a amazingly twisted dark theme. Playing through it reminded me of Silent Hill and Resident evil. Some of the puzzles are tricky but most are pretty easy. The hardest part about the game is survival. You will have to be sneaky and conserve ammo to make your life a bit easier throughout the game. I would say the only complaint i would have was with the Kidman DLC. you dont really get to use guns too much in it, which is fine, but i hate running and hiding all the time hence why i think the standard game was awesome. The complaint was more of an opinion for me. It was still a very good DLC and added a good 4 hours of gameplay. The Executioner DLC was very fun, i love how they added a first person aspect to the game and let you play as the keeper. Performance wise this game runs great for me with everything maxed out (i have GTX 980 SC--i7 5930k 6 core @3.6) But im sure it will run great with lower specs than that, I was getting an average frame rate of 100fps.

He needs to unravel the elaborate mind-bending mystery of a small village because...uh...all part of the job.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe beginning of the game was, I suspect, heavily influenced by Resident Evil 4. The experiences are cut and paste. Things get shaken up later on, though. Minus points for originality, I'm satisfied with the gameplay. I am beginning to wonder if we're trying too hard to depict horrible parodies of human life. After a certain point, it becomes ridiculous.\n\nStory:\n\nAt first, this story made me downright angry. Early game, there are many moments that it fails to capitalize on, narratively speaking. Early on, the story fails to provide stable footing. We aren't able to orient ourselves until much later in the game. Characters make strange decisions for seemingly no reason. Many of them respond to the hideous events in strange ways. Expect liberal amounts of deus ex machina to move the plot along.\n\nThat said, the antagonist's story does get more interesting. Once you begin to understand which events are "real" and which are not, you can begin putting pieces together, and understanding the logistics of what's happening. Unfortunately, many questions will remain unanswered.\n\nCharacters:\n\nThe protagonist alternates between silence, and cursing. You'll seldom hear more from him than, "♥♥♥♥."\nOh, is that giant, nightmarish monstrosity in your way, Sebastian?\n\nDon't mind Seb. Abominations of humanity irk him.\n\nHe seems more annoyed by his enemies than genuinely threatened. This is one reason the game isn't scary; the character isn't even scared. To be fair, none of the characters are interesting early-game. Two characters are not necessary. The villain grew on me. The attempt at pseudo-psychology felt a little lazy, but eventually I was so eager to understand what was happening, I quit worrying about it. The ending, though, was not exactly mind-blowing. I got the gist of what happened.\n\nGiven the fun gameplay, I recommend it. However, horror fans who've played the Resident Evils, The Silent Hills, and Amnesia (And seen any number of horror films) will be neither surprised nor frightened by anything here. One or two enemy types are  interesting, but by and large they're nothing new. On a good note, many enemies do require some sort of strategy to deal with; they don't go down easily. Boss fights in particular are fun, though will involve just a bit of trial and error. There is definitely some fun to be had here, even with the bland story, and of course, players new to the horror genre will most suitably be made to vomit and/or have nightmares.\n\nRecommended, with caveats.","June 21, 2015","true","22.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That  is what i try and do with games that have come out lately. Don't compare this to RE4 or any other game.\n\nHonestly, I don't understand all the hate this game has gotten. Sure the combat can be a little clunky. But it is not as bad as some people are making it out to be.\nThe graphics are jaw dropping along with the overall game and level design.

The storyline is super confusing but it starts to make sense later. The confusion keeps you super into it and wanting to get to the next cutscene. Voice scting is decent, enough to get by.\n\nVerdict: 9/10.... The reason it isn't a 10/10 is because of some technical issues,bugs, and the overall sub-parness of the port.

It can also get a bit aggravating on certain bosses, where you have to dodge their moves and then frantically try and adjust your aim to fire properly without wasting too many shots.\n\nBut persistence in the face of certain design faults is rewarded by one of the most enjoyable horror experiences I've had this year and, while The Evil Within isn't the masterwork that Resident Evil was, it's nonetheless a quite good game that survival horror fans'd have in their library.","August 10, 2015","true","31.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Takes time to understand what\'s going on, where you are, where you go. But eventually I ended up loving it.\n\nThe COMBAT: You need a decent computer to play this. I had to upgrade my old ♥♥♥♥ to be able to play without any lag. I had no issue then, everything was fluid, beautiful and complex. You upgrade your brain...to upgrade your weapon. It\'s a mind ♥♥♥♥ game remember? The green goo is your friend. You can craft, upgrade some weapons, abilities, ammunitions. I really enjoyed that. Combat system itself is efficient, you can hide, stealth and you are human...you can\'t have a ridiculous amount of ammunitions with you, which makes the game more interesting tactic-wise. You wait for the right moment to shoot, etc.\n\nThe GRAPHICS: I really love them. The explosion of zombies, blood and brains can look ridiculous but I don\'t care. I freaking love it. I love the monsters, I love the creepy areas, I love the gore effects, I love the traps.\n\nI am scared quite easily if I set up the right mood, and I had a bunch of scares and heart race while playing the game.

I bought it during a holiday steam sale out of curiosity because I read all the really negative reviews from all the critics on steam. Overall it was actually pretty good and fairly entertaining. I was more so drawn to it because I was curious to know what happens next after each chapter. There was a mix of good and bad things.\n\nAs far as BUGS go, the only slight issue I encountered with this game is sometimes the textures on certain models would fail to render right away but then they would appear a few moments after. Specifically on some of the bosses I had to fight with slimy tentacles and limbs. No map textures or anything like that. As far as everything else the game was smooth as butter with the 60fps cap at the highest settings and it NEVER once crashed on me. I did not meet the requirements even. (dual core i3 @ 3.8ghz r9 270 8g of ram). The system requirements are BS.\n\nThe GAMEPLAY was alot like re4 which was one of my favorite games btw so It didn't bother me too much. They could've come up with something new though TBH like any new game should.\n\nFIGHTING the zombies was not as epic as I had imagined considering how scary they looked. The encounters were rather predictable and repetitive which consisted of: Melee back up avoid the counter attack/"flailing arms or weapons" then melee again repeat 5 or 6 times till their head magically explodes or just shoot them a couple of times as they walk up to you slowly. If they charge you take a few steps out the way.\n\nThe A.I wasn't that challenging as they would sometimes run up against picket fences and walls and the gun play itself wasn't very intense or as satisfying as RE4. You might shoot something every once in a while if you had ammo but rationing resources was kind of forced on you. The one thing I absoluted HATED about this game was the stamina feature. Anytime you run out of the few seconds of sprinting stamina you had, Instead of slowing down, he would pause for a few painfully long seconds which was a guaranteed instant death in a boss battle or chase scene. Like as if he was a winded morbidly obese person. This got on my nerves more than anything and I felt was complete BS. I get the reason for the stamina feature but you don't pause to catch your breath if you're being chased by a psycho chainsaw murderer WTF!\n\nWhat I did really like about this game was the visuals. It was eye candy and it played very well. The level design was very convincing. Each room or hallway was very detailed and the lighting and overlays created a strong ominous atmosphere which at times put me on edge. Enough to make me apprehensive of going into certain rooms. The characters and monsters were some of the most aesthetically pleasing I have ever encountered.\n\nWith that being said I would recommend this game to a friend but not for full price.","January 23, 2015","true","65.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Poof, now you're in a sewer with basically no explanation whatsoever as to how you got there. Better get used to a lack of context. It's really bothersome in that it makes it difficult to rationalize pushing forwards at times.\n-Poorly told story. It has potential and a fair amount of depth to it, but you get drips of narrative at a time until well over halfway through the game and by then the vagueness that remains isn't at all justified. It's DLC baiting, really.\n-Poorly fleshed-out characters. I still like 'em and all, but there could have been much more there. Not much to go on in the character development department, really.\n-Enemy variety, or the lack thereof. 99% zombies of the typical weapon-wielding type.\n-Poorly optimized for PC. Good luck keeping a consistent 60 FPS; my GTX 980 didn't manage it in places.\n-FRUSTRATION. There's a Dark Souls level of difficulty to specific scenarios in the game, only you can generally blame poor design and a lack of timely checkpoints for your many deaths while dealing with her rather than your own mistakes.\n-Gore isn't scary in and of itself, apparently. Even if you turn it up to 11 or 11,000 or beyond, as The Evil Within does.\n\nIn case this isn't TL;DR already:\n\nSprint time: 4.0 seconds. Early on you'll be surrounded by zombies, and this is what you've got to work with. Exceed those four seconds of slowly-recovering sprint time and your character will stop moving and gasp for air for *several* seconds, regardless of how imminent the nearest zombie's ax is to his head. Factor in the facts that melee attacks are nearly useless, you've very little ammunition (if any) and your character's aiming abilities are informed mostly by apparent alcoholism, and it's safe to say you're incredibly weak and vulnerable at the beginning of the game.\n\nYou'll gradually grow stronger, sure, but initially you're going to be looking at a lot of frustration due to protagonist Sebastian's generally not being an unrealistic badass. Unfortunately, this frustration will keep showing up later on in the game when you're facing certain poorly-designed bosses; there's no way to really kill her in a particular encounter, for example, and if anything the real offender here is the checkpoint system. You're guaranteed to die in certain scenarios at least a few times, and the checkpoint system has no apparent logic regarding when and where to kick in.\n\nAside from the frustration factor I generally enjoyed the game, but damn if it didn't nearly cripple it at points. Buyer beware, but I'd recommend it on sale, if you think you can handle an initially contextless, very difficult Resident Evil 4 with some frustrating points hampering an otherwise good (but not especially great) experience.\n\nAlso, upgrade the crossbow and invest in full upgrades to harpoon bolts. It helps.","January 22, 2015","true","41.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It gets to the point where you just face palm and stop having fun.\n\nEvil Within had a decent story going and could have taken this game anywhere.

But when you're standing in the open daylight, with a bunch of the same enemies in a cage, and a guy standing next to a lever that you can't kill....

The possibilities are insane as far as sequels go. *So on a final note, if at a later time they decide not to continue this story/game with a sequel or anything I would actually lower the rating from 9.5 down to about an 8(eight).

I STILL play it after realizing hw much replayability it actually DOES have.\n\nIt seems like this game is almost fully created by the director of Resident Evil 4, as I'm sure you've read or heard by other players, articles. You can say it's HEAVILY influenced by it, in fact; that they tried to make something better than RE4, and the end result, to me, AND a lot of other people, has come to be a very dramatic iteration of RE4, only with a majorly different storyline. A lot of the environments in the early stages of the game can easily be assumed to have been heavily influenced by RE4, as I said. But, the game quickly derails from its predessesor's setting after, like, the fifth chapter: i feel, anyway. But again, that's a good thing! Not everyone agrees, and there's NO way that this game can amount to the sheer success of RE4, deemed by MANY as one of the best video games of ALL TIME. I absolutey ADORE RE4. I've played it on every port it's ever been available on, and beat it so many times on each of them.\n\nThis game doesn't seem, though, that it was meant for the things it wanted to do. The stealth portion of the gameplay is decently accurate; adding bottles to pick up and throw sums it up to be something that's manageable and understandable. The combat is a bit sloppy, in my opinion: it seems like enemies will NEVER go down, no matter how many times you shoot them [in the head]. This goes into my next point.\nThe Evil Within is agonizingly difficult, or it can be, anyway. Even on it's lowest difficulty, the game insults players by adding how 'casual' difficulty is "for the weak and fearful". Makes me feel like I'm playing a game developed by id software, where all of their games make you feel like crap for playing on easy. Wolfenstein: The New Order's easiest difficulty is called "Can I play, Daddy?" Quake 3's is something along the lines of "Don't hurt me, please!"\nI love id so much ^-^\n\nIf you're planning to get this game for your PC, the chances are that your computer will ♥♥♥♥ itself playing it. I really wouldn't recommend this game for play on a PC. Consoles, sure thing!! This game is AMAZING! Not clearly as much replayability as RE4, but some. It's story would require a few subsequent playthroughs anyway; if you wanted to fully understand it's wonky, segregated storyline. The DLCs for the game sure do help with that, too. Those are steath based-though, and require a bit of patience, as you'll be quite surprised how different it is from the main story. The main game is action-based, whilst The Assignment and The Consequence are [almost] ALL about story and stealth. You WILL enjoy this game in it's entirety if you're patient enough for both it's calustrophobic atmosphere and it's plentiful flaws, which are nothing too major, by the way. They're just a few things that amp up the difficulty and crank up the already masochistic and blatant feel you have while playing it.\n\nI hope this helps ^-^","July 23, 2015","true","175.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It turned out to be one of the coolest games I've ever played.\n\nThe visual designs of the environments, the enemies, it's all absolutely incredible and the way you are just thrown around all these different places and situations feels like something you really only could pull off in a video game.\nThe game keeps a wonderful pace throughout it's lengthy runtime, always mixing up shooting and stealth and never letting you feel overpowered - you will always be on the edge of your seat. It's a very difficult game (and some sections can be pretty frustrating to get through, although I personally enjoy these kinds of challenges) and it thrives on tension - if you're not playing this in a darkened room with headphones, you're doing it wrong. The excellent sound design gives life to the repulsive, insane and wonderfully creative imagery.\n\nThe DLC is excellent too and a great companion to the main story - the excellent and character-driven plot (which admittedly took me a while to really get into in the main game) is made more clear, while new elements are introduced to the gameplay to keep it fresh. There's also plenty of extra challenges by way of MANY achievements and well hidden collectibles if that floats your boat.\n\nAll in all, I struggle to understand why this is only rated "Mostly Positive" on Steam. I seriously think it's amazing and extremely engaging.","March 28","true","30.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Everything about it just sounded so amazing.\n\nWhen the game finally came out I couldn't really buy it so I waited. Eventually a friend bought it for me as a gift and I had been playing it on and off since around Christmas time. I instantly fell in love with the game. At first the game did scare me, I will admit. So I would play for short periods, but after the initial shock of the jump scares and other things, I just got into the game and played through it.\n\nThere were some parts of the game that were rather annoying because the controls can sometimes be clunky when you're playing a third person game. But putting those minor bugs aside the only real issue I had was following along with the story at the end of the game.\n\nThe ending was probably the only real confusing part for me, it was fairly vague and for me I'm not huge on that. I like figuring things out, but I also like having some useful clues too.\n\nAll-in-all it is a GREAT game and a must play for anyone who has enjoyed Resident Evil and probably Silent Hill as well, or even survival horror as a whole. It is a great game and definitely worth the time to play it.

Shinji Mikami knows RE4 was his greatest achievement, a true revolutionary title and its clear when playing this, a lot is taken from RE4 with some modern mechanics to boot. I'm not gonna lie, there were a few times I felt like chucking my controller in frustration, this game isn't easy. I died 39 times over the 16 hour campaign and thats supposed to be pretty good compared to most. Ammo is truly scarce in this game, so the added stealth kill mechanic should always be your first line of attack.\n\nI would love tell you the story is good but well I'm not really sure if it is. Its certainly starts off interesting but it clearly doesn't want to explain itself, by the end it just leaves you with too many questions, which normally would be good but since I don't have proper answers, I'm left with what seem to be plot-holes which make no sense.\n\nIf you're going into this expecting a revolutionary survival horror game like RE4 was back in 2005, you're going be disappointed but if you go into it expecting something like RE4, more old school survival horror with most of the difficulty and clunkiness intact. I'm sure you'll have a great time, albeit with moments of frustration along the way.","October 18, 2014","true","26.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also, the 5.1 sound is wonderful.\n\nSure, the game is not perfectly optimized. But I feel that that technical grittiness enhances the horror and grittiness of the game as a whole, so I’m really okay with that. The aspect ratio is, just as the game, brutal. It didn’t bother me at all, I actually think it enhances the game.\n\nThere’s some cheap scares in the game which is disappointing. Mostly the gore of the first couple of chapters. It does set the mood though, it forces the atmosphere on the player from the start so in that respect it works great, and the game is very tense overall.\n\nThe game is like a wonderful mix of Resident Evil 4, Silent Hill and also with a pinch of Siren. Unfortunately it’s easy to make comparison to the Saw series of movies as well.\n\nThe story kept me interested throughout and I wanted to see it through to the end. Great B-horror story with a lot of body horror thrown in!\n\nUnfortunately the last chapter suffers from, what I see as, design flaws. I kept running low and sometimes even out of ammo. Instead of restarting the chapter I used the console command to give me infinite ammo at one point, which I’m not happy about. Hopefully they can fix this in a patch.\n\nTowards the end of the game you get in some gauntlet type situations. I rarely feel that these are necessary and/or fun, but I do understand that they are put there to act as a catharsis for the player after the otherwise tense experience.\n\nSome of the bosses border more on the annoying and tedious, I’m mostly referring to the returning boss in chapter ten. Tension is definitely lost when you die and have to redo a section a dozen times.\n\nOverall a really great game. If there wouldn’t have been another Resident Evil after #4, and ten years later a ”spiritual successor” was released, this would most definitely be it.","October 18, 2014","true","27.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also, the 5.1 sound is wonderful.\n\nSure, the game is not perfectly optimized. But I feel that that technical grittiness enhances the horror and grittiness of the game as a whole, so I’m really okay with that. The aspect ratio is, just as the game, brutal. It didn’t bother me at all, I actually think it enhances the game.\n\nThere’s some cheap scares in the game which is disappointing. Mostly the gore of the first couple of chapters. It does set the mood though, it forces the atmosphere on the player from the start so in that respect it works great, and the game is very tense overall.\n\nThe game is like a wonderful mix of Resident Evil 4, Silent Hill and also with a pinch of Siren. Unfortunately it’s easy to make comparison to the Saw series of movies as well.\n\nThe story kept me interested throughout and I wanted to see it through to the end. Great B-horror story with a lot of body horror thrown in!\n\nUnfortunately the last chapter suffers from, what I see as, design flaws. I kept running low and sometimes even out of ammo. Instead of restarting the chapter I used the console command to give me infinite ammo at one point, which I’m not happy about. Hopefully they can fix this in a patch.\n\nTowards the end of the game you get in some gauntlet type situations. I rarely feel that these are necessary and/or fun, but I do understand that they are put there to act as a catharsis for the player after the otherwise tense experience.\n\nSome of the bosses border more on the annoying and tedious, I’m mostly referring to the returning boss in chapter ten. Tension is definitely lost when you die and have to redo a section a dozen times.\n\nOverall a really great game. If there wouldn’t have been another Resident Evil after #4, and ten years later a ”spiritual successor” was released, this would most definitely be it.","October 18, 2014","true","27.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Starting out as a routine investigation things very quickly get out of hand (as they so often do) for the protagonist. Nothing particularly unique about this game with regards to story and the puzzle sections are lacluster efforts that dont really engage your brain or even serve to take you away from the over the top gore that makes up the vast majority of the game.\n\nThe pacing is just about spot on and between the stealth, action and running away like a girl sections you will never be stuck doing the same thing for too long. Being released around the same time as aliens isolation there will be innevitable comparisons so for my 2 cents i will say that overall the evil within maintains a level of tense atmosphere but cannot quite hit the sheer moments of horror that isolation manages to achieve.\n\nA worthwhile purchase and enjoyable game but nothing spectacular. 7/10\n","October 19, 2014","true","23.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Anything and everything in this game can be an instant death trap, even with all health upgrades. The game has an incredibly frustrating habit of changing the rules or adding new mechanics and then instantly killing the player for his lack of clairvoyance.\n\nUnfortunately, this is aggravated by the lengthy pre-scripted, inescapable death animations and the awful checkpoint system which ensures that you get set back as far back as half an hour before the point that killed you. Only about half the time that I died was I completely sure of what had killed me, or had any idea of what to do to escape death the second time around.\n\nAmmo is extremely limited; more times than not you'll have more enemies to fight than bullets, and the shooting controls are finnicky and unresponsive, making sure you waste ammo on near misses. Enemies also display no evidence of taking damage or how close they are to death, so you won't know how effective you're being until the enemy simply explodes.\n\nThe boss fights are the absolute worst. The bosses all have a ridiculous amount of health and all use instant death attacks, full health upgrades or no; Some of them are invincible and require special strategies to defeat, not that it's really possible to tell that they're invincible until you're out of ammo. Boss characters are shamelessly reused multiple times with absolutely no alterations to their mechanics as well. And the final boss doesn't even count; literally a gun turret and a rocket launcher fall out of the god damn sky and you're told to just go to town.\n\nThere's no story worth talking about here. You get some half-baked ideas about shared consciousness that goes nowhere, characters that hit their one-note personalities and never grow or change in any conceivable way, a plot concerning a conspiracy and the main character's dead daughter that goes nowhere, plot elements that are introduced, fleshed out, and then promptly abandoned, a main villain who's so cartoonishly evil and overpowered that it's impossible to take him seriously, and in the end, nothing gets accomplished, nobody learns anything, and absolutely no part of the story gets explained or receives any kind of closure whatsoever. To ensure it's as confusing as possible, every location is isolated from the other ones, and there's no clear goal or objective, and the game has no continuity whatsoever.\n\nI don't even mind that it wants to be an action game or a Jason film instead of something that's actually scary, but since it's marketed as a horror game, let me be absolutely clear; There is absolutely nothing in this game that is the least bit frightening. This is just any regular action shooter, just covered in giblets and grotesque imagery. Because that's all you need to do horror. Just give a big guy a chainsaw and everyone will ♥♥♥♥ their pants.\n\nAt it's best, the game actually threatens to be entertaining. Some of the gunplay sections can be satisfying when the shooting controls feel like cooperating and you actually have ammo. Enemy heads explode when killed, which never gets old. The crossbow adds an element of strategy and depth to the fights. That's when the game really shines; when you're given a large open level, lots of ammo, and a number of enemies and just told to dispatch them however you like. But then you run straight into an instant kill trap that you had no chance of seeing coming because it had never been introduced before this point and indeed will probably never show up again.\n\nI don't hate the Evil Within, but my experience with the game was largely negative because of the poorly designed mechanics and narrative. There are parts of the game that are fun, but every time you start to have fun it feels like the game punishes you for it.\n\nBasically, if you read the entire review and still feel like that's your cup of tea, go ahead.

There are so many key things that The Evil Within delivers exceptionally well:\n\nArt Design/Graphics\n\nThe graphics are stellar (with exception to a few cases of low-res textures, but the game is filled with so many great high res textures is there really room to complain?) with absolutely fantastic art direction; at or past the level you would expect from a jhorror title. Every area in the game is expertly crafted to make you say "wow" every time you turn a corner (literally) or move to another area. Every new area is made to look unique and significantly different than the other in many different aspects. This makes the game stand out among other beautiful games and helps the pacing of the game. If you love and understand the art design of Resident Evil 4, you'll know what I'm talking about. They take that and one up it hard.\n\nYUCKY YUCKY EW EW Factor\n\nI'm not one to get queasy over video-game gore, but holy does this game have its moments in that department. Usually, horror games/movies with shock value as their target fall flat for me but this game really makes me cringe at times, in a good way. Yes, the game has good buildup through certain parts and it does definitely factor in more psychological aspects of horror which are equally as shocking; blood and guts isn't the only thing about the game that will get to your head.\n\nMusic\n\nThe music of The Evil Within adds to the already high-level of atmosphere. Every score is crafted specifically to induce feelings of anxiety, dread, and relief. It is such a great feeling when you're stalking through dark, gritty, dangerous environments with textured ambient tracks layered with anxiety subtly play in the backround, when suddenly you notice Clair de Lune playing softly in the distance signifying a safe-room up ahead. The relief you feel rivals the classic RE save rooms.\n\nTense Gameplay\n\nRemember that feeling you got playing RE4 getting to the first segment in the village? Remember how insanely stress inducing that and the entire game was, and every combat section put you into really uncomfortable situations that would make you panic and not think correctly? This is exactly what happens in The Evil Within. The feeling you get in combat in this game is definitely akin to what you feel on your first playthrough of RE4. You really need to think and make quick decisions in order to survive. One wrong move and you're dead. Ammo conservation, planning, and quick thinking is extremely important.\n\nThere is stealth gameplay as well, and no: it is not forced (except for a short section in the beginning of the game). You can choose to attempt to stealth--which usually ends up being too difficult--or attempt to fight. It is nothing exceptional or advanced but I'm glad it is there as an option to be able to get a couple safe kills without alerting everything. The controls are fluid and the inventory system is fast and effective.\n\nStory and Symbolism\n\nThe game's story is rather unique if you understand it past the simpleton explanation. It requires a lot of speculation and listening to really get a good idea of what is going on, otherwise the plot will be practically non-existant to you. I really enjoy this type of story-telling and it does it rather well. It doesn't give you too much or too little; just enough for you to get the basics and not enough to leave you speculating and really thinking and investing into the lore of the game. The game ends with a very satisfying conclusion and pacing is excellent, if not almost or as good as RE4's famous pacing. The characters are great and I found myself liking, hating, and being suspicious of or drastically changing feelings about certain characters in the game, which is a wonderful thing that is rare to see these days.\n\nThe game also has very prevalent symbolism in many of the bosses as well as environments, very akin to Silent Hill. Monsters and the like do not exist for the sake of being killed, they exist to add another extra layer to the story to be speculated upon. It adds a deep personality to the game which can keep you thinking and thinking. Here's hoping there will be a sequel to the awesome game-world Mikami and co. have created.\n\nBossfights\n\nThe bossfights in the game are crafted amazingly. Each encounter is vastly unique from the other, and with exception to very few bossfights they all require attention to the boss's technique and abilities. Imagine if every boss in RE4 was made with the attentiveness and detail as the fight with Vertigo or the two fights with Mendez. Every bossfight is memorable in its own right, and all are satisfyingly difficult and downright cool.\n\n\n\nNow, despite how absolutely great this game is, there is some legitimate controversy and things to be wary of when buying this game:\n\nPerformance and Framerate\n\nDespite the ridiculous system specifications for this game, I was able to run most of the game at ~60 fps (when unlocked through the dev console) with my 3GB 660ti and old Phenom II 1055T x6 3.2ghz. The game runs rather poorly in some beginning sections of the game but otherwise it runs adequately. Never was the framerate unplayable or noticably poor. However if your PC is even a little bit out of date I really recommend upgrading if you want to play this game optimally. I believe the performance hit comes from unoptimised phsyics and a very hefty amount of--rather beautiful--particle effects.\n\nThe game was designed around the 30fps target not because it was "cinematic" but because of the performance target on next-gen consoles as well as the rarity of Japanese developers making games anywhere past 30fps. The game is playable on 60fps but is not recommended due to lack of optimisation (which they announced they are doing for future patches). Personally I did not experience any quirks or bugs with the unlocked framerate. Performance-wise, this game was no headache.\n\nAspect Ratio\n\nAnother thing many people have been complaining about is the absurdly wide aspect ratio. At first I was definitely skeptical about this, and used the dev console to change it to remove them and instead play in fullscreen. The wide aspect ratio artificially adds a lot of FOV and playing in your native aspect ratio will likely cut most of it off, making it practically unplayable. So I decided to settle with the black bars. After playing the game for a while, you get used it and start to understand why this was a design decision.\n\nFor starters, the extra FOV helps a ton. It also avoids breaking immersion as higher FOV with less-wide aspect ratio causes warping and distortion around your screen. Secondly, the wide aspect ratio is there in order to simulate a cinema-esque experience. No, I'm not talking about the 30 vs 60 fps debate, I'm talking about the difference between watching a film in different aspect ratios. In film, wider aspect ratios allow for wider shot angles and ultimately provide for more beautiful shots without warping the image with higher-fov with a thinner aspect ratio. The wide aspect ratio of this game simulates that difference very well and gives the game a very unique and enriching feel. After finishing the game I can say that there is a legitimate reason for this and I actually like the decision. It is disappointing that 1/3 of your screen isn't displaying anything, but honestly it is worth it, even without considering the alternative.\n\n\n\nSo, should you buy this game? Yes. The Evil Within is a very unique and thrilling experience that I would recommend to anyone, especially if you're a survival-horror enthusiast. If you can't get past the hardly-limiting technical aspects, then that's too bad. You're just missing out on 15 hours of purebred Japanese brilliance.\n\n9.5/10","October 16, 2014","true","16.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PKStylin/recommended/268050/","PKStylin","Starman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PKStylin/","151 products in account","So. now that the steam reviews have all but summarized all the technical issues with the game, how about I tell you about the gameplay? Assuming some of you would like to know that kind of information.\n\nI think the best way I can summarize the game play is it's similar to Resident Evil 4, but with the jankiness of the controls that were present in RE 5 and RE 6. There is a lot to like about the game, but in that same vein, there is a lot to hate too.\n\nYou can definitely tell this is a Shinji Mikami game. A lot of easter eggs and nods towards old school Resident Evil are here. There is even his common trope with rocket launchers present here too.  I want to talk about the things I liked with the game, and the things I hated. Hopefully, this will be adequate enough.\n\nThe Atmosphere is amazing. I was engrossed into the story pretty deeply, even if you can kind of piece it together after the first third of the game. There is no real secret as to who the big bad is, and who is associated with him. Really, the mystery is more along the lines of what caused the big bad to be so bad in the first place. It's very involving.\n\nand well....that's about it really. In terms of all the points, that's the only one I have no problems listing as a positive. everything else could go either way. Allow me to explain why.\n\nThe resource management in this game is ultimately less strategic and more frustration. It's fine in the early game. But once you get past chapter 7 the resource management of this game falls apart. See once you start the game, you learn to respect how little you have. The stealth aspects give balance where it's needed. Certain segments can get passed without firing a single shot. It's later on however where that no longer matters. Somewhere in the middle the shark is jumped and there is a focus on hoardes. You are flung into a situation where every enemy is already alerted to your presence. This is a problem, cause all those bullets you hamfisted and tried so dearly to covet are now all dumped into the hoarde. And don't worry; the size of the hoarde makes it real clear that all your bullets are meant for them. After you dump literally all your ammo during one of these segments, you desperately claw around and maybe find a very paltry amount of ammunition, and this is to carry you through another segment where, now you fight a miniboss.\n\nLet me summarize that for you: early game flow is scrounging ammo and stealth segments. mid game is hoardes and minibosses, so you scrounge, dump all your ammo, scrounge again, and do the same thing.  End game is a mix of the two, but primarily the hoarde and boss thing. I just don't see what they were going for here. There is challenge, then there is nonsense. It's nonsensical that you force the player to fight all these overwhelming odds when you try so hard to convince them in the early game this is about making every shot count and using stealth is pivotal. Why on Earth would you throw them into action segments? There is an aspect of balance that is not clicking here, and it isn't fun fighting 10 enemies with 5 pistol bullets, 2 shotgun shells, 2 matches, and a flash bolt. It's just not.\n\nThis would be all but alleviated if melee was viable, but melee is not viable, even when you max it out. What could take 12-20 hits unupgraded, gets down graded to 6-10 hits. That's still not adequate, cause it takes forever to deal with one enemy that way. I just don't understand why or where the identity crisis came into play. Do you want me to fight hoardes of enemies and bosses? is that the game you wanted? at the very least, well equip the player before the boss battle. They do on a couple bosses but the remainder? come on. Do you want your game to be stealth-centric and make bullets precious? lower the frequency of hoardes or bosses. I mean... you have struck gold with RE4 Shinji, why on Earth are you taking a page from a game like RE6?\n\nEnough about that though. Hey speaking of RE6, remember that gross FOV with the really terribad janky controls? The Evil Within's title is actually a reference to the controls. Cause my god man. Be prepared for some very janky badness. I don't want to spend too much time talking about it. It's easy to just say they are bad.\n\nStory was kind of covered in atmosphere, but the ending is insulting, if not expected and the only real way to end it really. The story is decent. Again, you have to go in with the mentality of wanting to learn about the villain, not why things are happening.\n\nThe game is long as hell though. my first playthrough took 16 hours (I have no idea why it only says 15 hours on record, considering I also am doing a 5 hour run.)\n\nI think I talked about this game enough. I do recommend it, surprisingly. it's not a terrible game. It's ok. It's not worth the hype. Try and wait for a sale.\n\n","October 16, 2014","true","15.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

But nonetheless the game offers a great survival experience. The first half of the game is incredibly tense and the game peaks in chapter 9 for suspense. After that it kinda becomes a rollercoaster of action scenes but still enjoyable to me. The biggest problem with the game however is the story or rather the lack of it that is. The first few chapters you're pretty much clueless which is fine and adds to the atmosphere, halfway through the story seemed to become pretty interresting but it just stopped explaining whatever was going on.\nThe game just kept adding more question without answering any of them. I kinda hope they will fix that with the DLC but that shouldn't have been needed at all.\n\nThe gameplay itself, the unique bossfights are awesome I enjoyed every second playing through the areas.\n\nThe game only uses a few weapons, which basicly comes down to a revolver, shotgun, sniper, magnum(strong revolver), which I think is a good thing yet the crossbow does not make a whole lot of sense. It has several functions like impale (duh), flash (huh?), explode(ok I guess), freeze (say what?), electrify(oh common), fire(ok that actually is useful considering you want to burn corpses, but what?!?) Anyway it adds some strategy into the fighting without the need of several types of equipment so let's just roll with it.\n\nThe upgrade system is fairly simpel and lets you chose how you wanna play the game, so thats a plus most definitly.\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed playing the game even though I was expecting a cool twisted story.\n8/10","November 15, 2014","true","39.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It swings from being a genuinely scary game to feeling like a decent-if-forgettable RE4/5 clone and back again. There are hurdles to jump over in understanding how the gameplay works before you can get into it and then the game never leverages the strengths of that system. There's a creepy element of psychological torment that pervades the game and story, but when it pokes it's  head through the story is, quite frankly, kinda stupid.\n\nThe gameplay takes the Resident Evil 4 route, but where Leon Kennedy was a badass and thoroughly capable of handling any situation Sebastian Castellanos is a wuss who's not particularly great with a weapon and whose physical attacks are hit an enemy like a weak gust of wind. You'll quickly find that open combat is a terrible option as enemies are tough and even headshots that blast away large portions of their skull only seem to moderately annoy them. It's easy to burn half your ammo on one enemy. While it's not particularly scary the early sections are like a playground where you slowly stalk enemies and carefully choose your point of attack.\n\nThen you find out the game has an upgrade system. Suddenly you're given a lot of options for improving you physical prowess and the usefullness of your weapons (of which you'll get a small arsenal of) The game begins to force you into open combat more often and it become obvious that ammo conservation isn't important because the game is regulating how much ammo is dropped by enemies and from crates. I just blasted my way through the stealth sections at the end because they're just set in boring corridors that are a pain to navigate carefully though and there's not particular penalty for going rambo through it.\n\nWhat really saves the game is the middle third of the game which slows down the pace and uses the game's atmoshpere to good effect. You'll traverse torture chambers, crypts, a deserted mansion, and caverns and that pacing, sound design, and enemies just feel right. I constantly felt on the edge of my seat waiting for something horrible to happen.\n\nThen you hit the city and the game loses momentum through to the end. It lacks both the atmosphere of the middle third and the well designed stealth sections of the first third. You're too well equipped and upgraded for the action sequences to feel like a desperate fight for your life or the stealth sections to feel imposing. The big bosses are silly rather than imposing. It's not bad, but it's not the type of horror game that The Evil Within should have been.\n\nIf you're a fan of horror games it's worth it to pick up on a sale because when it works The Evil Within works really well and when it fails it's never bad, it's just disappointing. Despite everything I still liked The Evil Within even if I wanted it to be so much more than it was.\n\nSome further thoughts if you're still reading.\n\n- The game is very linear and features little exploration. The idea was to constantly warp you around and keep your bearings off, but I don't think it worked that well although I respect the theory behind it. Interestingly one of the best and creepiest sections is set in a mansion that you have to explore.\n\n- Has a Dark Souls thing going on graphically where most of the architecture of the buildings looks great, but any thing natural looks like doo-doo. There's a part where you walk through a field of sunflowers and the texture on the ground looks like it was ripped from an N64 game.\n\n- Jennifer Carpenter (who played Debra on Dexter) gives one of the most bored and unenthusiastic voice acting performances you'll ever hear in a game. Fortunately she only gets a handful of lines.\n\n- I really like what they did with the RE style save room by making you question the safety that it provides you.\n\n- Textures are constantly loading slowly. Scenes cut to aother angle of things that don't have textures loaded. At one point a gate drops revealing a boss monster whose textures pop onto him a second later.\n\n- (SPOILER ALERT) If you want to be overly analytical about things you could certainly draw parallels between Ruvik's story and the nature of game development when surrounded by corporate culture. How he both has control of his creation taken away from him while simultaneously being trapped by it. As a game developer Shinjo Mikami is both typecast as "The Horror Guy" as well as having a lack of ownership over Resident Evil and being forced to watch it taken in directions he may never have intended. Ultimately, as this is Mikami's last game in the Director's seat (allegedly) Ruvik is ultimately looking for escape (and to try and scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of Sebastian/The Player along the way.\n\nBut that may just be me looking too deeply into things.","July 15, 2015","true","22.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Seeing only a portion of your screen does wonders for that, it's not for some stupid reason like "cinematic experience" like everyone says.\n\nStealth is a nice edition that was lacking in RE 4. Now you can save ammo by simply not fighting your enemies, which rewards tactical play. You also can't kill everything with melee like you used to in RE 4, your fists are there to make you some space and even then they're not too good at that either.\n\nThis game is also pretty hard, even just on the survival difficulty, you'll feel like it's christmas every time you find some ammo or health.\n\nIf you can't un-cap 30 frames per second you really shouldn't be playing video games on your dads computer, I'm sure you have a console for you to play on lying around somewhere.\n\nGood game, it's the RE 5 we wanted.","October 17, 2014","true","7.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

When that goes away use your down key 3 times and then Enter. This will get you into Setup. Now change graphics settings to "Windowed" and choose a smaller resolution. Now use the ESC key to exit, you'll be asked to save settings, say yes and things should now be windowed.\n\nYou should now be able to set up the resolution you really want to use.

No, they aren't your cuddly, happy-go-lucky, singing zombies. They're brain eating, violent zombies, and some of them can shoot you in the face! Maybe they're not zombies so much as they're mutants. Probably mutants.\n\nScare Factor!\n\nOverall, so far, the game is spooky. It's not scary, but it's spooky! Nothing has made me jump with fear, but some of the death animations and the graphics overall are spectacular. The camera can be a little bit wonky at times, but that's normal with any third-person title. Those shadows, though, man - those friggin' shadows.\n\nEverything Else\n\nNo, I haven't completed the game yet. My game time is accurate, but I know enough about the game to write a review. People whine about game time and reviews all the time, but get over it, you know if you like something or not. I'm recommending it, anyway. The sound design is top notch, the graphics are gorgeous, and it's a great game. It scores rather high on the awesome scale, but it's not the greatest game ever made.\n\nMajor complaints.\n\nCamera doesn't always cooperate with what's intuitive to the player, and figuring out the weapon system can be a little tricky. Not that the weapon system is difficult to learn, just kind of tricky at times. Maybe that's built in to make the game harder?\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nDeath is cheap and the way things are set up, you'll die a ton of times trying to do something, then you'll get it right and feel like an idiot that you died several times, before getting it right. I find that kind of thing hilarious. The limited ammunition aspect of it plays into the horror aspect, and the mood is right. Even still, as well crafted and beautiful as the game is, with the fantastic sound design and use of lighting and shadows, it's just not that scary.\n\nI'm giving this an 8/10, maybe I set my expectations too high, but that being said, I definitely wasn't disappointed. 2014 was a golden year for games, and this one definitely belongs in the trophy case.","May 3, 2015","true","7.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

Sure all games have their pros and cons, but coming from the father of the Resident Evil series, theres is never rubbish to be expected.\n\nCons:\n- True it still is in some ways a bad port, the recent patches have fixed a few things but people still complain about a decent FOV, well that in my opinion doesnt bother me because i never had problems with the field of view in gameplay\n- Lack of more content like done in previous Shinji's - Resident Evil 4, this game had the potential to have a mercenaries-like game mode but with the stealth factor and scarce ammo, making it a lot more challanging, so stricting the game to replaying the campaign over and over to only unlock more stuff kinda becomes tedious because there is nothing new\n- Sebastian. I don't say his acting is bad but in some cutscenes and dialogues you just feel the main character fall a bit off then what expected, from all the notes you read he seems and excelent detective although in some decisive dialogues he has no idea what happens and misses sometimes a bit more character.\n-Side characters. the main two, Kidman and Joseph, Kidman has her own misterious story to be explained hopefuly in the upcoming dlc, but at some point you just lost track of what's happening as in, you reunite, you get lost, the world has gone to hell and you reunite again and no explanation whatsoever of how he survived or what happened in between.\n\n\nPros:\n- Renewing the formula, sure Resident evil games where survival, but i finished the old ones carrying lots of ammo by avoiding fights and running or just not doing damage enough until they died. Not in here. In The Evil Within that doesnt happen. What can happen is you seeing yourself in a forced battle against the Haunted creatures carrying 5 pistol bullets, only one bolt for your x-bow and 2 shotgun rounds. This game has immersive item manegement since the Stealth factor not always lets you get all the way, sometimes it's just to trick you into trying to spare ammo, other times it's just to test you stealth/distraction skills and ending up fighting a horde minutes later.\n- Horror. I wouldn't personaly say it has horror since i consider horror something that scares me, or makes me afraid of going forward, afraid of what to expect, although that happened in one or two moments of a chapter, the game has more Gore than Horror, although it can create some intense scenes with the help of a perfectly crafted soundtrack.\n- Soundtrack. It just plays perfectly, every moment having it's own theme song, every enemy having it's background mixed excelently with the music, the creepier the better, and even the ending credits song is awsome.\n- Difficulty. Game can be difficult to new true-survival horror players, since i've seen a few broadcasts recently and wondered myself watching people dying by having no ammo to survive, people dying to environment because they don't observe the surroundings, people just dying because like i saw in reviews, wanna go "guns blazing killing zombies" and end up just getting grabbed, cornered and dying. But if you are old-school and like the resident evil 4-5-revelations gameplay with tactics behind every enemy, weakspots and exploration, then you should be fine\n-AKUMU. Well, stating Shinji Mikami's words - "we decided that people who complete the game in AKUMU mode should have every right to brag themselves about it, why? Because it's a true achievement for fans of survival horror" you wonder why? well, one hit kills, so try getting to the end without getting grabbed, shot or just stepping on a trap, otherwise, restart checkpoint and try again ;)\n\nTL;DR\n\nGame has all it needs, some optimization failure due to console port, but a great game for the fans of survival horror, and even better game for Resident evil (not 6) fans, well crafted, long enough, and with so much history that it's easy to get lost in it and don't understand the ending.\n\n9/10","December 15, 2014","true","30.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","3"

It's unfortunate that the initial set-up process prior to starting the game is causing so many people to give up on it.\n\nOnce you really get into the meat of the campaign it just keeps getting better and better. The enemy and level design in particular were OUTSTANDING! Everything is extremely well balanced in terms of combat and equipment management. You are forced to play conservatively. There are high-octane action sequences on occasion but stealth is absolutely necessary the majority of the time.\n\nWhat really impresses me in retrospect is the fact that slowly sneaking your way through level after level never became the least bit boring thanks to the insane amount variety in the level design. For an action-horror title I was blown away at how I was consistently excited to see what the next dungeon had in store for me.\n\nI loved how difficult it was, too. Challenging and at times frustrating but always fair and always, ALWAYS stressful (in a good horror kinda way).\n\nFrightening, graphic, action-packed, addictive, and tons of fun.\n\nI loved The Evil Within.","October 21, 2014","true","18.0"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

Probably the most anticipated horror game in 2014. I saw the reviews, and I'm sad. Are graphics, and fps more important in 2014 than GAMEPLAY? Look at Crysis 3. It looks very fancy, but it's a simple FPS. However The Evil Within is different. Let's start with the negatives (there won't be a lot): 30 fps lock (people are bi*ching about this the most. It runs surprisingly well on consoles, but WE "The Glorious PC Gaming Master Race" (as some call it) can unlock the fps, so this shouldn't be a problem on PC. Bigger problem is the optimizing, or to be more exact, the loss of it. This game either runs on your computer, or not. You can't gain fps, by disabling effects, HOWEVER you don't need an i7 for minimum. I have an i3-4130K, GTX 660 2GB OC and 8 GB DDR 3 RAM, and I could run it on max between 40 and 50 fps. One other thing: The A.I. is dumb.You can easily hide from it, if you go round an object. After a round, the enemy loses interest in you, and you can kill it silently. These are the negatives, and now the positives. The game is VERY atmospheric. If you sit down to play it, you will want to complete at least that chapter, which you are in. Other positive, the levels are very unique. Not just in locations, but in gameplay too. One moment you are in an old village, but in the other, you are desperately trying to reach the exit of a hallway, filled with traps. This IS a true survival horror. You have to scavenge for supplies, try to find secret areas, and you have to SURVIVE. The game has an upgrade system too. Throughout the levels, you can find green goo, which you can use to upgrade your character in a place, called Asylum. You can find map pieces, and keys too, which you can use there. So are you ready for a journey through the twisted mind of Shinji Mikami?\n\nPRO\n+ atmospehric locations\n+ interesting story\n+ challenging\n\nCONTRA\n- unoptimized\n- some minor bugs\n- not suitable for everyone\n\nVERDICT: If you like or liked Resident Evil 1 plus 4, and  you'd like a game like those, The Evil Within is YOUR game!","October 18, 2014","true","40.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

All I can say about this game is that it's exactly like Manhunt (from Rockstar) except there is no variance in how to take someone down. For those unfamiliar how Manhunt plays : the idea of this game is to sneak around opponents and achieve objectives (sometimes room to room). The sneaking portion is about all the adrenaline you get. There are enemies present however, not all of them can be killed. I feel like this game is more of a graphic/graphical novel where the player is simply moving the narrator place to place. There is a game here, but feels extremely minimal in my eyes.\n\nThe art work though is top notch.

Though some enemies you just can't take out and will dispatch you immediatly when you're in range of them so that can lead to moments of running for your life.

I cannot attest for the look of the game, I do not care about the look, so long as it is competent and I feel it is. I really wish I could play with shadows on high, because the lighting in this game is phenominal. The only thing I feel is off is the aspect ratio, which is a forced 21:9 and apparently on some resolution settings you get an odd full black box around the screen. I don't get this playing on 720p, but I have seen some experience it. But so far the atmosphere has been enough to keep the odd aspect ratio from really bothering me.\n\nAnd yes, the game runs at a locked 30 FPS (I'm just barely achieving that consistently, so no complaints there). Apparently you can unlock it to 60, where they promise to fix any issue with that. But any issues involving a fully-unlocked FPS specifically will not be tended to, unfortunately.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it works rather well. I mostly played with a controller, but I tried out the keyboard and it works just fine as far as I can tell. You can rebind keys and even assign an action to multiple keys. The controller has a few predetermined settings, you can't totally change which button does what, but the setup works just fine.\n\nEnemies seem somewhat intelligent, I had one get caught on a fence for some-odd reason, but that was the only instance where the AI seemed poor. There's some stealth elements, because getting overwhelmed or running into traps is the easiest way to get killed. It works for what it is, hide under a bed, in a closet, or just crouch-walk to your next destination, hoping not to get seen. Stealth kills are also a thing, which is great because that saves you on a lot of ammo. There are some parts in the game, however, that force you into combat. So far those sections tend to partner you up with someone, but only if the enemies are coming in large waves.\n\nThe weapons in this game seem really damn satisfying though. You can blow off chunks of the zombie-enemy-things, even with the starting pistol. There's a crossbow in the game, and, without giving too much away, it's good. Very good.\n\nAs for the story, well, it's pretty nuts. I can't say if it's really good or bad because I'm not at a point where any real explanation has popped up. But it's engaging and interesting to say the least. I can't say it's terribly frightening, though I've played enough survival horror games to build up an immunity to most scares. I am looking forward to playing more, even if it's due to my own morbid curiosity.\n\nOverall, it's a competent title. I'm enjoying it for what it is. It's clear that Shinji Mikami hasn't given up his idea for survival horror, as you can see hints of some of the Resident Evil games in there. Specifically, RE1 and 4. I'm sorry to hear that others have had issues, but I, personally, have not. If you are intruiged by a horror atmosphere and don't mind a couple of oddball, but mostly harmless game design decisions, I'd say this is a good one. If you're hesitant, I wouldn't blame you for waiting for a sale or a patch of some description. I plan on updating this when I get around to actually beating the title, so my opinion may change.

The story is kinda messy specially towards the end (Then again so were RE1-4) However its the damn gameplay that soars and elevates this game to classic material. Not since RE4 have I had such a rewarding and satisfying experience.\n\nThe game overall to put it bluntly for the people that want the gist is its a perfect blend of REmake and RE4. Towards the later parts of the game it becomes more like RE4 however thats not a bad thing and the game progresses at a steady pace. I have not played a game thats made me ♥♥♥♥ myself in terror at not only enemies but the ♥♥♥♥ing bosses. These bosses are some of the best ♥♥♥♥ing Survival Horror bosses I have ever seen....period.\n\nSo overall I say this if you liked the earlier RE games and RE4 maybe even RE5 pick this up its ♥♥♥♥ing worth it. Now to get to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t criticisms the game has been thrown at for. The aspect ratio, whats the big deal here? It was a design decision and I feel it payed off. The game to me just looks great with it and I can't picture playing it without it. The 30fps lock. REALLY? You guys are gonna ♥♥♥♥ing complain about 30fps lock on a game that is Survival Horror? This is not a arena shooter or multiplayer game where 60fps is required for an optimal experience. This is again SURVIVAL HORROR. I just find it so stupid that people are getting hung up on something that has nothing to do with the actual GAME. I'm done ranting. This game is great in my opinion and it ♥♥♥♥ing puts Capcom to shame with their recent RE releases. Shinji Mikami is an asset they will sorely miss.

Or lack there of in this case. Is the game perfect? Absolutely not! But, does that make it a bad game? Far from it! One thing this game nails is its atmosphere. The Evil Within has a very dark and gloomy tone to its environment and it really gives off the sensation that each room you walk into holds something very sinister within it. The art style of the game is also rather impressive and adds greatly to the overall tone of the game... The character models however do not share the same style. While the creatures of The Evil Within look particularly twisted and gruesome, the character models of the human characters are unfortunately rather bland. The voice acting is serviceable but not impressive. I cannot make a full opinion of the story because at the time of this review, I am 7 hours into the game but from what I have played so far, the story plays heavily on the psychological horror aspect of the game, causing players to question what's real and what isn't.\n\nMy feelings about the gameplay of The Evil Within are mostly positive but there is certainly room for improvement. The gunplay feels good and the lack of ammunition and resources is a very welcome return from what players have had to endure with other recent so called "Survival Horror" games. The Evil Within is unforgiving with the amount of items that you can find in this world of nightmares and you will find yourself having to count your ammo, sneak past enemies and use quick thinking along with using the environment itself in order to survive. The user interface and character movements however are rather clunky and can land you into some serious trouble at times... One thing inparticular I found to be odd is the weapons menu is opened by clicking the right analog stick on an Xbox 360 controller. There have been many occasions where I have shot at an enemy and accidently opened the weapons menu because I clenched the controller when I fired.\n\nOverall, The Evil Within has its share of problems that need ironing out and the lack of optimization for the PC version is inexcusable. But, The Evil Within is definitely a game that needs to be experienced by Survival Horror fans and can help bring the genre back to being something to be feared instead of staying the laughing stock it is now for big budget Horror games.","October 15, 2014","true","7.7"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

At the start yes. There was stupid things like models missing from cut scenes and other really weak things that jumped out at me, when I first started playing.\nDid I start to feel terror and anxiety? Very much yes. I cared for the work I had put in clearing an area and didn't want anything unknown to find me and end my successes. I also didn't want to be scared by something attacking me I didn't know what there until it was too late.\nYes the bars at the top and the bottom of the screen are dumb BUT they are what helps feel the fear. You can't see everything all at once and while you are looking down for traps you can easily miss the fact that you, yourself are being looked at and are about to die!\nOh and the ways you can die. They put a smile on my face. One of the times I died it was so awesome I gave a little girly glee noise.\nI am not very fare into the game now. I did take 1 hour just to get to the intro movie. And it took me that long because the game is very detailed. It does give you so much to see. The storey is unfolding in a very creepy way.\nYES there are haters out there. I would have supported them until I found the "village" and what I found there, after it was all over, made me take some time to leave the game. I needed the brake. My nerves had been shot and I really could not take any more.\nI had to write this review.\nI had to let you know THIS IS A GOOD GAME. Yes there are a few things 30FPS with no "in game" way to change it. (But you can edit the config for the game to get 60FPS, so it's no big deal but it did suck to have to fiddle around instead of diving in. The devs need to add the option for 30, 60 or 120 FPS. I mean thats just standard today is it not?\nAnd yes the black bars at the top and the bottom did upset me to start with BUT they really do add to the game. Oh my they really do.\nAnd the last thing that ticked me off was WHY THE F, DOES MY MOUSE ACT SO STUPID IN THE MENU? Anyway I have and Xbox controler for my PC and games like this really are better using one to play the game with. The mouse issue is now a thing of the past but DOES REALLY TICK ME OFF.... REALLY? REALLY? REALLY.... I mean the first thing you are introduced to when you can take control of the game and start your setup is the mouse and OH IT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY!!!\nOK, moving on. I LOVE THIS GAME\nI think you should get it and play it.\nI have left everything out of this review that would give you any idea of what is a head for you except the Village and when you get there your life is your own to do with as you will... Oh and you will do away with your life if you don't look where the danger may be coming from...\nEnjoy.\nThe Evil Within\n7/10 - this score will go up I can tell as I get more into the game, it is based on the time I have been playing and on the 3 things that have really ticked me off. As I play longer and those things become less and less important I will come back and add new scores to my review. Stay tuned. This review is a living Review and will see updates.\n\nUPDATE 1 of this review\nI am now 5 hours in and I am taking my time. Part of why it has been a day since I played the last 2.5 hours is becuase this is doing my nerves in. I can't play for a long time. I keep needing to take a rest from it and then I will wait and wait some more. It's freaky! And it's cool!\nMore to come!\n\nUpdate 2 of this review.\nSomeone in the forums wanted to know if the game was scarey. I wrote this:\n\nTo answer the question I ahv e one word ATMOSPHERE. Set the mood before you play. Play at home, at night, with the lights off, With your screen setup correctly (I MEAN WITH A SCREEN ADJUSTMENT DISK FOR BEST WHITE AND BEST DARKS get an .ISO) and set all the sound up just a little. Don't play the most easy game lvl, play the game and the hardest lvl the game lets you. Have no distractions. Turn off your phone. Wear headphones to give yourself the"?Is that noise coming from the game or outside??" And this game will make your skin crawl!\nEnjoy.","October 17, 2014","true","32.2"," 20 of 39 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","20","39","0","0"

How about Silent Hill? How about lots of gore and excellent gunplay? If you answered yes to 1 or more of those questions, I would advise you to check this game out!\n\nI have now completed the game and I can only recommend the game more, the gameplay holds the weight of the overly ambitious story. The combat feels intense and becomes increasingly scary due to your constant lack of resources, the horror isn't stacked on too thick with little to no jump scares throughout but you do always have a feeling of dread as you never know what is coming for you next (this is in part because of the games incredible music and sound design. MANY of the noises the enemies makes are bone chilling and because of very effective lighting effects).\n\nThe gunplay is very rewarding and "crunchy" as in you can feel the heads limbs and other areas being hit and often exploding (I actually shot an enemy in the face and blew its face clean off with only a hole left in the middle of its head it continued to chase me around).\n\nNow that I have completed the game I still stay true to my opening statement and would recommend this game to anyone looking for a cool new 3rd person shooter or  a very nerve racking and often terrifying survival horror experience!","October 14, 2014","true","17.8"," 31 of 61 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","31","61","0","0"

This is enough to run 99 percent of games just fine; however, I did have to dumb down the graphics setttings on this to get an adequate frame rate.  To my perspective, the graphics still look great, but I know that some people will dislike this.\n\nFRAME RATE:  A lot has been said about the game dropping frame rate, but in 2 hours of play I have not had that problem.  Of course, I did, as I said above, dumb down the graphics a little.\n\nENEMY AI:  This will irritate some people because the enemies follow you around when they have no reason to.  You finally escape one room, and the bad guy just follows you into the next one even though he didn't see you.  Now you go about escaping the same guy again.  Make it to the next room?  No worries.  He decides to follow you there, as well.\n\nCONTROLS:  The controls are very basic.  The only problem I had with them is that the CROUCH key is also the same as the HIDE key, so while sneeking around I did on a couple of occasions accidentally hide.  I strongly suggest going into the settings and changing crouch to toggle so you don't have to hold <L Control> all day.  One more thing on the controls, I have yet to throw a bottle and stun an enemy.  I always miss.  The aiming for this particular feature is a bit bizzare, so I just use the bottles to cause distractions.\n\nGAMEPLAY:  Well, there's a small intro section and then you are thrown right into it, hiding and running from a chainsaw wielding gimp.  The gameplay is very challenging.  You will die, and you will spend a lot of time hoping the gimp will turn around and go elsewhere, and then hobbling across rooms in the split second he's not looking.  Definitely a traditional third-person horror experience.\n\nOVERALL:  So far I am enjoying the game, though I've been a bit nit-picky above.  So far it seems like a buy if you like third-person horror games with a lot of stealth features.","October 14, 2014","true","4.4"," 45 of 89 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","45","89","0","0"

Although I got the feeling it stopped taking itself seriously very early, it still kind of bored me and felt dragged out at times. While the chaos is kind of creative it's still almost as if they pulled out actions and scenes out of a hat randomly and went with it.\n\nCharacter and sympathy wise I literally had none because I found it impossible to connect with any of them. I did read all the journals, listen to all tapes, and such though.The dialogue in or out of cutscenes is pretty sparse and even the main character is like "Not again?" and "This place AGAIN?*sigh*" at some parts. He read my mind.  The voice acting is kind of hit and miss. The main antagonist tries too hard in my opinion but I got used to it, however due to his apparent powers I have no idea why he didn't blow up the earth in chapter one or something. I can understand that some evil force would like to toy with you a bit but this game drags it out to no end and I was more annoyed and bored by him than scared.\n\nYou're sometimes briefly in a team with a character and they're great at shooting and killing things but  you know you'll be separated in a few minutes. I predicted exactly how at least three times and you get the feel for when a cutscene is about to happen and such. I'm not over analyzing it I just found it very very predictable.\n\nI can't remember much from the Day After Tomorrow movie but if you imagine one of those apocalyptic type of movies that's been released the last couple of years where people are driving in a city with skyscrapers falling apart as if mother nature could do anything at will, this is basically it in a nutshell after three chapters. It's more fitting like in the movie Akira made in 1988.\n\nThe atmosphere of the beginning and the detail of a few later chapters is something I wish they had more of. You also have an infinite lantern which if we didn't have it I'd say the game would be much more frightening. I'm a bit confused why they included ~2 minutes of swimming in one chapter but didn't utilize it at all after that. Once again felt slightly out of place, random or unecessary (in terms of programming?)\n\nThere's a pause and screen after each chapter which took me out of the experience more than I thought it would, especially since some chapters aren't very long. They only give you the options of saving (though sometimes I had the ability to save just before the end of a chapter) continue, or go to the title screen. If there were actual stats or something perhaps it wouldn't feel as unecessary.\n\nAnyway I really don't want to ramble on but I do recommend this still. I just wished they had more choerent chapters or level design because Chapter 3 and early chapters got a really good vibe and it's not too too linear. I did however enjoy the difficulty, it's a bit Dark Souls-y but a bit cheap at times due to one or two hit kills that could happen if you're not used to certain monsters or traps. Your arsenal of weapons isn't overly huge but the combat system is very addictive so even your basic handgun feels satisfying at the end upgraded or not. There's also unlockables such as the classic Rocket Launcher etc.\n\nAs of now I'd rate it a solid 7.5/10.\n\nI might get back to this review and score after I finish it a second time and on a higher difficulty. Which is one of my favorite things about this game, it's addicting. I really want to grab all achievements, map pieces, upgrade my character in NG+ to the max, and all that which is very rare for me or games these days I think.\n\nNow I'm off to Nightmare or perhaps even Akumu (One hit and it's over) difficulty.","October 13, 2014","true","29.6"," 171 of 341 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","171","341","0","0"

Firstly, only play this if you have the patients of a saint! It can be scary, however if you are contantly having to retry sections from a checkpoint OVER and OVER it takes the atmosphere away completely.\n\nAlso there seems to be so little ammo in the game you run around and find maybe 2 or 3 bullets at a time, not enough. Maybe they want you to play more of a stealthy game but why can't I play it how I want to?\n\nI am currently right at the end boss level and have no ammo for anything, so I spend my time running around picking up a bullet, firing, running away etc etc.\n\nI don't think I can even being myself to finish it.

It is neither an ode to Silent Hill nor a glorification of RE4, but a shambling incohernet mess of a game with many techncial issues. It has only become playable since the recent third patch for me so I have arrived late to the party. The terrible ID4 engine has been used and yet again there are texture streaming issues even on a SSD and r290 videocard with 4GB ram, and the aliasing is just terrible..it's just not a pretty looking game. I'm playing with a 360 gamepad and it feels clunky, it is far worse with a keyboard, particularly if you are a twitch shooter, so get used to loading textures every time you spin.\n\nThe save points are spreadly quite thinnly, which worked well in Alien Isolation, but here I have been continually robbed by cheap deaths (such a locked in a room with fire looking for a needle in a haystack or emptying all my ammo into an invincible enemy). I don't often rage quit but it has happened three times in this game, it can be quite unfair to the player and then to add insult to injury it sends you back 20mins progress..grrr..\n\nI found this game neither scary or particularly suspensful, it relies on far too much gore and the plot is just dumb.  Outlast is the best survival horror title I've played this year it was brilliant (made me wet my diapers), Alient Isolation was great too if a little too long. But Evil Within just doesn't know what it wants to be and succeeds at confusing and frustrating the player. The heavily criticized Silent Hill: Downpour was also a far better game than this one.","December 20, 2014","false","16.4"," 15 of 30 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","15","30","0","0"

The times players do see daylight will leave them admiring the stunning visuals and taking a short breather. The audio fits in perfectly with the gameplay. There were no letterbox and framerate issues when I completed the game.\n\nThis game punishes players who don't explore and gives players who explore just enough to get by.\nThere is a very big price to pay if you don't explore. You will miss crucial weapons and not just be given them later. Once you miss items they appear again much later and even then you can miss them.\n\nI played on survival which seemed to be normal difficulty but it was extremely challenging and unforgiving. I found myself in boss fights with almost no ammo most of the time. I died so frequently to the point where this game became frustrating and felt like a chore.\n\nThe story was interesting but I felt that a lot has been left unanswered.\n\nEven with some of the issues mentioned I did enjoy the game and it was the first time in a while where I was truly challenged.\n\nA very good game that the horror franchise needed and will satisfy players for completing","January 10, 2015","true","21.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The plot is a little tricky if you don't get the collectibles, and the melee system is a little clunky and weak, but other then that, I can't really complain.

Many bad review make me hold to buy this game maybe because bethesda screw up at day one because pc performance lock at 30 fps and the letterbox , even now its updated the 60 fps lock still an issue a bad tearing so i played at 30 fps lock and doesn't bad at all, beside that this is an amazing game. and i dont know why people are complaining about limited ammo because its feel more survival atmosphere so we have to use environment to kill the enemies, management our ammo and weapon. check every corner for traps and enemies and think how to solve our path. This game si awesome if you like a survival and stealth game not for who like full action game.

Even if it's not the Capcom logo when you run the game, it's obvious that the same mind is behind this game.\n\nThe mechanics of the game are somewhere between Resident Evil 4 and Resident Evil5, you often realize enemies are too close and ammo is rarely enough...ofcourse the limited sprint and not to fast movement keeps you tensed.\n\nThe weapon upgrade system is at least decent and motivates you to search any corner of the environment for green gel (used to upgrades weapons and skills).\n\nThe surprise element is always there ready to make you jump and the game never gets repetitive.\n\nFor me Evil Within is the piece of art I stopped hoping to see and suddenly is here.","January 22, 2015","true","22.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Those familiar with Shinji Makami's work will feel right at home. To those who don't know who he is, if you enjoyed Resident Evil 4, you will most likely enjoy Makami's latest work. The game is capped at 30, but there is an option to cap it a 60 which requires an unnecessary amount of power under the hood. Nontheless, this is one of my favorite steam games of all time, both as a Makami fan and as a gamer alike.\n\nPros:\n-Old school survival horror\n-LOTS of blood and gore\n-more blood\n-limited resource management\n-lots of small innuendos paying tribute to the Resident Evil series if you pay close attention\n-great replay value (new game+, unlocked weapons, etc)\n\nCons:\n-Unnecessary amount of power needed to run at max settings\n-Lots of loop holes in the story (DLC?)\n-Boss Recycling\n\nAll in all it's a great addition to any survival horror fan. The price of admission may seem steep, but it's well worth the price to those who understand where this game's roots are from.","December 14, 2014","true","81.5"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

It's ridiculously hard, one hit and youre dead. There aren't many checkpoints so once you die you have to redo a lot of things over and over again which is extremely frusturating since all the monsters are extremely overpowered.\n\nThroughout the first few chapters of the game you start  with absolutely nothing to defend yourself with, and you receive more pointless items in the game rather than useful things like amo or health supplies. With this, you are expected to beat "boss" monsters with extremely low resources. Bigger monsters take more than one shot to kill, so lets just say having 2 bullets just doesn't help at all (no matter where you hit them, whether it's the head/heart.)\n\nOf course, the game is also very laggy and is even more frusturating when you're trying to run away from something. With the horrible lag and game mechanics, I would say that it is almost unplayable.","December 12, 2014","false","9.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

In this game, the answer is 5. In words: Five. If you want to be able to carry more, you have to inject green jelly taken from killed zombies into your brain. If you do it for some hours, you might be able to finally carry 30 matches at a time. No, I am not crazy, the game is.\nOh, that kind of concept applies to all of your abilites and everything in this game. If such makes sense to you or you find this very interesting, then this game is for you.\n\nOtherwise, think twice before bying, even on sale:\n\nIt looks good in screenshots, but is a bit clunky to play. Rather bad console port, not that many fps.\n\nThe story seems to be "guy goes mad and gets teleported from one scene to the next", which probably is an excuse to have rather different scenes and screnarios which are not coherent graphically as well as storywise in some way. It's just a mix of mad nightmares and sometimes bad showmanship, probably by total different level designers, which is interesting at first, but wears down later.  The demo was promising, however the full package didn't hold what was promised.\n\nIn my taste, you have to run away too often. There is no coherent way to handle things, sometines it is just a guessing  game to try if any of the following works (or, in most cases, NOT): Run away? Kill this enemy? Or do I need to find something before I can progress? Press a lever? Piece my pants? Oh, and you can't save whenever you want, checkpoint style, that means you have to repeat a long sequence to try out again what to do at the end of that sequence.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChronicHedgehog/recommended/268050/","ChronicHedgehog","ChronicHedgehog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ChronicHedgehog/","85 products in account","I expected a stealth based horror game, but The Evil Within is a below average, mission based action game. The comparisons to RE4 are somewhat understandable (Mikami, horror) but misguided. The core mechanics of RE4 are far more polished, the enemies are better designed and the encounters are infintely more engaging.\n\nThe game peaks early with the stealth and tactical based gameplay of the "RE4" village of chapter 3, and it's more or less downhill from there. Aiming with a controller is terrible, even with accuracy maxed out. Whenever you go into the aiming stance the camera zooms in an absurd amount -- it's basically a shoulder shifted FPS, and it's extreamly disorienting -- the controls reorientate costing you a precious second or two. What's reallly mindboggling, once the enemies cross a certain closeness threshold, say five or six feet, the closer they are the more difficult it is to land a shot. I suspect encounters were too easy with the over the shoulder camera shown in earlier builds and this was a lazy last minute fix. Haunted AI is pretty dumb (even when multiple bullets whiz by their head they don't know what's going on for a bit), and hit reactions and player feedback are incredibly basic, culminating in lackluster encouters. You can try to play tactically but in most cases it's better to brute force your way and shoot everything.\n\nLots of design issues; invisible walls, you can't pick up The Haunted's weapons (no reason is given why), some bottles you can pick up, the rest are props. Some ledges you can get up on, other similar ones, it's a no go. Stealth is very basic, you can't shoot or open a door from stealth, and Sebastian has hardly any transistion animations leading to many a moment where his actions don't match the tone and sequence on screen.\n\nEnemy designs are generally uninspired and not creepy in any fashion. The majority of The Haunted look like Hellraiser III rejects, generic zombies or something ripped straight from 13 Ghosts. Low poly design and textures don't help either. Two boss characters fare better; The Keeper is imposing and Laura is a complete nightmare, even if they're more than just a little familiar.\n\nThe environments look decent but they're ultimately forgettable; they lack character and all feel similar.

It was developed in October 2014. The Evil Within is about a detective who is called Sebastian  which got an emergency call at a hospital when he was there than everything went bad.He remembers nothing anymore and he is living his worst nightmare. He´s switching between Illusions and between the " real" world which isnt a real world. There is much more but i dont want to spoiler.\n\nNow from the story I come to the gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay isn´t noob friendly I would say because you dont have 200 shots in your gun. There is a ammo maximum which depends on the difficulty level. There are three different difficulty levels: Casual, Normal and Expert. If the difficulty level is low you have a high chance to find some ammo and if the difficulty level is high its very hard than to find some ammo so you need to be really careful with your ammo. One another thing that i really like is that the enemys have eyes and see you really fast  so sometimes the best option is to stealth things. The Mutants arent the only problem . There are traps sometimes that can kill you instantly so you need to disable them .While you are disabling them you get parts to craft some arrows for your crossbow which are very useful in emergencys.\n\nThe reviews from the past:\nReally forget them. They released an update for the game and you can play it with 60fps. Also guys its not a Crysis 3. This game isnt made for a nice graphic. It´s not bad but we have seen better things in the past. It has a depp minded story line and that is much more important.\nA tip from me:  I play with a XBOX360 Controller because the controlling is much better and the reactions are much faster than with the keyboard and mouse. I also know that my playtime seems low but I played and finished the game on a friends console so I really know this game.\n\nAll in one a nice game which I can recommend highly.\nRating: 8,5/10","November 27, 2014","true","5.6"," 17 of 34 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","17","34","0","7"

Hope for the survival genre to get back to their roots.\n\nWell it did, in the first half....\n\n\nThe thing is, I think this game started so WELL. When I actually met the zombies and got my first gun, I was so careful with my ammo and tried to sneak-kill every zombie to save my ammo for later.\n\nThat ended up with being me and having loads of ammo I could waste. (Since I pretty much upgraded ammo stocks first.)\n\nBut as the game went on, it just became more, more and more... action...\nI had chills early in the game but that quickly disappeared when I got around 3-4 hours into the game.\n\nAnd normal difficulty was damn easy, I expected some challenge and I even overthinked some things to do in certain areas, which was something a child could figure out. But I made it more complicated than it was.\n\n\nThe story and characters was somewhat okay. I liked the main character (Because he says "♥♥♥♥" so much I just started to laugh at the end) and I hated the woman police girl, Kidman w/e.\n\nBut the part that ruined this game quite a bit for me was the ending, other may have liked it. But for me it left with a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n\nBut overall it was a fun experience as long it lasted with each new enemy I encountered and so on.\n\n\nSo I guess, I recommend it to people who likes the horror element with survival horror elements, but with action resident-evil style further on.","December 5, 2014","true","18.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

I've watched people playing it on console, where it's a solid experience.\n\nThat said? DO NOT BUY THIS GAME ON PC.\n\nThe port is so atrociously bad, it'd almost be laughable if I didn't just spend $60 on it. Stuttering and freezing on what appear to be early PS3-era graphics at best, even at highest settings. Going to lowest doesn't fix the horrible performance issues. Video options that are so minimal they aren't even worth mentioning. Aside from the obnoxious and obtrusive locked-on letterboxing that is (a 'stylistic' choice I'm sure, and not just something to cover up graphical glitches from more incompetent coding).\n\nMaybe if they patch it at some point in the future... but this is frankly an embarassment to game development at present.\nGoing from the absolutely STELLAR Alien: Isolation to this was shocking. They are almost polar opposites, technically speaking.

It tries to do everything, succeeds at nothing, and we're left wondering what we're playing. A boring, frustrating slog that I overpaid for at $20.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Functional, but it somehow managed to get worse than RE4's near-perfected formula. The camera is too close while running, and intrusive while shooting. This leads to some frustrating combat, in which hits don't register when they're too close. Perhaps the most frustrating of all, though, are the insta kills - there are many. You get used to the booby traps pretty quickly, but there are many other environmental and enemy kills that no one could have the prescience to see. One enemy in particular - the long haired woman - is a horrible annoyance, as she knocks you down and pummels you for a few seconds, your health bar slowly being drained, with nothing you can do but sit and watch. You would think that in that situation there would be a QTE - as this game has plenty. The insta kills make the game's checkpoint system necessary, as you will die a lot.\nYour play time will consist of sneaking behind enemies and knifing them in the head, running and hiding from bigger enemies, run-and-gun action, sometimes with an AI partner (there are even some fixed turret sections later on), slower-paced horror sections (differing from the stealth-heavy sections by having fewer enemies and thus more freedom to walk freely), and mild puzzles. These switch by chapter, and the latter two are the only parts that really make this game worth playing. There are also parts where you are forced to walk (rather than sprint), especially during conversations between characters. This throws a stick into the spokes of the game's pacing, reminding me that I'm playing a game that's not responding to its previously established controls, and doing nothing to heighten immersion (which, we can assume, is the reason for these moments). There's an upgrade system present, which becomes pretty redundant by the end, as you're showered with in-game currency. It's only really an issue for the first third to maybe first half of the game, where you've pretty much got your weaknesses figured out and what type of play style you're going for (killing the horror in the process - more on that later).\nThere are also a few sections where the perspective changes, and you have to run towards the camera away from an enemy. This doesn't happen enough to become accustomed to, and it's unexpected and unnecessary, as one could just run from the enemy with the standard control scheme. On at least one of these occasions, the preceding cutscene transitions back into gameplay without any indication.\n\nGRAPHICS: Looks great. Environments are well-detailed, with minimal reuse of textures and models. Noise filter is stylistic and adds an eerie, surreal quality to the game.\n\nAUDIO: Best part of the game, in my opinion. The music is nothing to write home about, but the sound effects are top notch. Unfortunately, some sound effects are reminiscent of other games (the Fatal Frame door opening creak and the Silent Hill-esque menu chimes in particular), which made me nostalgic for those games instead.\n\nENEMIES: There's some creativity here, with some genuinely eerie enemies. Mostly you will be fighting some variant of zombie, but the different bosses/recurring enemies are all unique with their own quirks. Unfortunately, there seems to be little rhyme or reason to their presence, some appearing for only one chapter with no foreshadowing or subsequent explanation. It feels as though a bunch of enemies were designed because they seemed like a horror game thing to do, rather than with any care for the themes or style of the game.\n\nENVIRONMENTS: A similar situation to the creatures, minus the creativity. Again, there's not much pattern to the locations visited, and the connections between how you visit them are even less clear. Often, you will be knocked out, pulled through a hole, or some other excuse to appear somewhere completely different than where you just were. Either the environments are claustrophobic or big, open and funhouse-like (think Downpour), and quite often full of gore. As with the enemies, it feels like many locations - a mental hospital, an old mansion, a village in the woods - are present because this is a horror game, rather than because they add anything significant to the story or aesthetic.\n\nHORROR: This is where the game falls spectacularly short. There are some hints of goodness here, unfortunately overshadowed by mediocrity and the desire to incorporate as many styles of gameplay as possible into the mix. The running and hiding from enemies can be tense (if frustrating), as can walking down a dark hallway disarming traps. But it's punctuated by so many action sequences and brainless stealth that we don't have time to appreciate it. Add the rage-inducing insta kills and frustrating combat into the mix, and we find ourselves being more annoyed (to put it lightly) than scared. The game lets the horror down in many other ways, as well. The aforementioned upgrade system nearly cripples the tension and possibility of fear, as the player can identify their weaknesses and adjust them accordingly. Other horror games use upgrade mechanics - Fatal Frame, for example - but in that case, your currency was directly related to fighting enemies, essentially having you risk your health and use your film for the sake of upgrades, a difficult choice to make. Furthermore, the difficulty curves were consistent. The Evil Within has you searching every nook and cranny for green gel, with the game getting (fortunately, in this case) easier as time goes on.\nMenu hints telling you how to play the game prevent experimentation and exploration. On-screen button prompts for quick time events serve to ruin immersion. Forced walking sections break the flow of gameplay, while intending (and failing) to immerse the player. Checkpoints that eliminate consequences for dying, encouraging a rushed, action-oriented approach. These elements all serve to degrade the fearful aspect of the game.\nAnd perhaps the biggest offender of all is the final boss fight. Without giving much away, in my personal opinion this is the worst final boss fight I've ever seen. It is indicative of the AAA video game attitude, towards horror in particular. It's big, grandiose, easy, and requires little thought to complete. If you have your audience laughing at your game - and believe me, I was laughing at the end - you have failed as a horror designer.\n\nSTORY (mild spoilers): This is an area that's a little early to comment on, in my opinion, as many of the nuances of the plot have yet to be worked out. It's not particularly straightforward, but from the main plot points that I could gather, it's nothing to write home about. To its credit, it's more than "evil bad guy", but it still doesn't innovate much (in fact, it reminds me a lot of the plot of Silent Hill 4). Its biggest problems are that it's spread out over the game's needlessly long run time (it took me 15 hours), leaving large gaps in between plot points, and that its populated by boring, lifeless characters that I had no desire (or means) to empathize with. Furthermore, there are dead ends in the plot (Sebastian's backstory goes nowhere) and seems like a setup for DLC.\n\nOverall, I found this experience incredibly lacking. I'm glad I didn't let myself get hyped for this game - it was a tedious, rage-inducing trudge through disparate gameplay elements. There was nothing overly satisfying to me about this game, no one element that I can point to as being particularly noteworthy. That is by no means a detriment in and of itself - but this game is so severely lacking to the point of showing contempt for its audience. What we're left with is a Frankenstein's monster - a design by committee horror experience that does nothing to innovate, and everything to frustrate. I cannot recomend this game to anyone.","December 15, 2014","false","15.2"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

The game jumps all over the place (literally), and the story makes pretty much no sense (even after the credits roll).\n\nThere was not a single point in the game where I felt like it was a 'horror' game, and most of the attempts at horror just come off as cheesey schlock.

It's been awhile since i've played something that's drawn me in and made me jump. The plot is a little tricky if you don't get the collectibles, and the melee system is a little clunky and weak, but other then that, I can't really complain. It reminds me of some of the original resident evil and silent hill games that I used to love and still remember fondly.

Visuals of the highest quality, gore of the highest quality, gameplay of the most mediocre quality.\n\nThis title reminds me of why I hate this genre so much.  Not to mention this titles absolutely incredibly stupid trap system ("Yeah, wow, theres this GIANT claymore tripwire here for no reason at all, whatever shall I do?") The fact that its literally on rails ("forward I must go, dodging these silly giant claymores that are everywhere breaking immersion for no reason"), and that being chased by zombies sucks when you fall prey to invisible video game walls that prevent you from jumping into that nicely rendered stream.  This feels so constrictive it makes the game redundant.  Where's the fun in being chased by zombies if theres no where to go? That fact just makes this game a glorified ipad puzzler.  "I throw bottlle, zombie move, I move, ha ha so smart"  I don't care if this game "gets better", I don't want to play through it now, I've seen enough.  Any developer stupid enough to put giant claymores everywhere for no reason in an attempt to "add a layer of depth" is not worth another second of my life's precious time.  I hope this message helps someone save some of theirs.\n\nAnyone but genre fanboys will laugh at this game's inept attempt at creativity and entertainment.  The gore is cool AF IMO. But I can watch a movie for that, and not have to be annoyed at dumbed down game mechanics.\n\nEdit;\n\nPlayed more, still the most corny, pathetic attempt at making a video game ever.  This game was made by talented graphical artists, and monkeys.  Yes, monkeys.  Not even the smart chimpanzees that they sent into space.  No, just regular, eat their own feces, monkeys.  This game is an insult to the gaming world's intelligence.  It reminds me of a terrible, terrible, NES game with next-gen graphics.  Something I would find boring and stupid when I was seven, nevermind today.","November 29, 2014","false","8.3"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

If it had ended at chapter 10 I would say it was a must play but, well, it didn't  The worst part is, some of the most interesting scenery and situations were in chapters 11-15 but without a change in enemies or gameplay it just couldn't hold my interest.  I was praying each chapter would be the last but the plot just kept rolling and as it turns out, it wasn't rolling to anything.  It just kind of stopped without answering any questions and after slogging my way through encounter after encounter of similar looking and acting enemies I just couldn't care anymore.\n\nThat being said this game has some amazing moments of mind bending city-scapes, twisted brutal imagery, and some epic boss fights.  Think of Inception mixed with Saw.  The actual gameplay has some amazing moments as well with surprise scares, fun gunplay and does a decent job of throwing in some set-piece moments that I don't want to spoil.\n\nI cannot think of a game more worthy of mixed reviews.  The first 5 hours I couldn't recommend more and some of the scenes in the final third are breathtaking as well but man oh man did it sometimes feel like wading through a neck deep swamp.\n\nRecommendation:  Yes if you can get it cheap, no otherwise.","December 20, 2014","false","18.0"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

I have a low tolerance for gore both in video games and movies so I'm elated to find out that the "disabled graphic content" is present in the game options.\n\nThe Evil Within has a Resident Evil 4 feel but it's more tense, atmospheric and difficult. I highly recommend that you try the Demo first and see if your rig can run the game smoothly. Thankfully I didn't experienced any glitches that hassled my gameplay, although I have yet to try if I can play it in a much high AA settings especially for intense chapters.\n\nEdit: added my rig's specs for reference.\n\ncpu: intel i5 4460 @ 3.2ghz\nram: kingston fury 8gig\ngpu: nvidia geforce GTX 650 Ti (1gb)\nOS: windows 7\n\nI haven't experienced any lag even if I set the AA settings to MLAA or SMAA, I just noticed that the textures are not impressive compared to those with higher GPUs and processors but for now, my present setup works well enough for me. :)\n\nThe game levels designs are really intense, engaging and frustrating; there are chapters where both the Boss, haunteds and traps are being thrown at you at the same time and these will surely deplete your ammo stock and health. Also the constant change of environment was really cool for me and it really keeps me on guard. Sebastian moves can be lethal if he's away from the horde so make sure to always upgrade his health and sprint abilities first, he's also capable of stealth kills except for the boss fights. Most of the Bosses scared the wits out of me (both in their character designs and their abilities), so I rarely played during the night and prefer to play it in the afternoon instead.\n\nThere isn't much can be said on the story - as no solid infos was really provided on what kind of organization they're up against. Despite finishing the game, I'm postponing my DLC purchase until further notice. I hope whatever un-answered questions there is on the main game these will be bought to light in the upcoming DLCs.","January 1, 2015","true","80.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Plays like an unoriginal version of Dishonored. It's not BAD but the storyline is fairly lightweight and the gameplay is far too console-style for my liking. It may be unfair to expect anything groundbreaking from a game birthed from Resident Evil's aging style of gameplay but despite some nice atmosphere in certain parts and the ability to kill deaders in a variety of ways (and some amusing ways to BE killed by them) It's worth what I paid for it in the 66% off sale but nothing more. There's a modicum of enjoyment to be had here which Is why I can't give it a thumbs down but, frankly, PC gamers have moved on.\n\n*edit* Yet another game crying out for a "thumb sideways"","January 26, 2015","true","2.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Once at the scene, they witness supernatural events that catapult them into another dimension and further into madness.\n\nTelling you anything more about the plot would ruin it.\n\nIf you love survival horror you will feel right at home. It plays like a mixtape Shinji Mikami put together for his loved ones.. except his loved ones exclusively like survival horror video games. It amalgamates elements all across the board all-the-while creating it's own atmosphere and story from scratch. The Evil Within is without a doubt a challenging, yet satisfying survival horror, however the mechanics aren't anything we haven't experienced before...With that being said it's not by any means a copy and paste, but this game's execution does overall feel familiar, especially to veterans of the genre.\n\nThe overall presentation feels like a spiritual successor to Resident Evil 4 that's amped up on steroids. It's got a consistently tense and grotesque atmosphere, but it's not pause-button frightening. A lot of narrow corridors with enemies and traps cutting off your exits left and right.\nIt does have some outdoor and larger area level designs, which are a genuine pleasure to play.\n\nThe mechanics feel adapted to more recent titles like The Last of Us - giving us a sprint, a sneak/crouch, a hide button and a weapon wheel.\n\nThe paranormal aspect feels most akin to Silent Hill's franchise in my personal opinion - with the player being right in the middle of changing landscapes and hallucinations adding to the hazards within the game, which are in the form of bear traps, falling spikes, trip mines, and more.\n\nEach enemy has the potential to come back to life unless completely decapitated. Another way to eradicate them permanently is to set their corpse on fire with a match in your inventory or a torch you picked up along the way.\n\nYou have four inventory slots you can assign weapons and items for quick draw and you can upgrade your abilities as well as your weapons from collecting green plasma in mason jars.\n\nOnce you complete the game, new game plus will unlock as well as harder difficulty options.\nHowever in the spirit of oldschool titles, it only carries over upgrades for that same difficulty level. So you'll have to go into the nightmare bare bones each new difficulty level.\n\n*Highly talked about information*\n\n*FOV: The Dev's decided to have a slight zoom in on the left side of the camera when the player aims to shoot enemies. This causes the left side of the screen to be filled up by the players body, while giving you focus on the reticle and enemy in front of you. It can be a bit distracting at times. But then again, it all comes down to preferences.\n\n*This game can run at 30 FPS and 60 FPS with v-sync locked.\n\nI love this game immensely and am currently enjoying my second playthrough.\nSetting corpses on fire and damning them back to hell hasn't been this satisfying since Gamecube's RE: Remastered. Also directed by Shinji Mikami. Coincidence? Not really. He's the Grandmaster of survival horror.\n\nPERSONAL RATING: 9.5/10\n\nAn underrated gem.\nI like to call this game The Last Evil Resident Within Silent Hill.","October 14, 2014","true","78.1"," 19 of 38 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","19","38","0","2"

I like them for a survival horror. I like feelling uncomfortable or restricted while playing them.\n- Subtle post-process effects like, noise, glows/blooms, chromatic aberration and some dithering for AO and the keylight shadows. Particle sprites for dust, smoke and fire are acceptable and well executed for a multi-platformer.\n- Facial expression looks better in person than in YouTube videos or wherever you watched gameplay. Is not hyper-realistic but it looks better than I expected (I talk more about graphics in the “cons” section)\n- Boss fights. They are good and tense.\n- Aside it’s linear I like the path the developers made for the player.\n- The OST is very good.\n- Clever UI and item mapping.\n- And of course Resident Evil, other survival horror games and movies references.\n- My favorite chapters are 6, 7 and the end of 9th :)\n- The Model Viewer ;)\n\nCons:- The ending and the last chapters are less interesting than the first 60% (wich is great).\n- Meleé and barehand fights are too simple (at least is not Silent Hill Downpour hahaha!)\n- I couldn’t enjoy much of the TLOU alike stealth system. I think is a good addition but not that well executed.\n- I hate Ruvik's design (at least during game). Maybe similar concept (skinny, cryptic etc…but not as cliché as he was with his actions).\n- It looks really good in general but they could have improved pop-up textures, tessellation and DOF on the idTech5.\n- Dynamic shadows resolution.\n- The city chapters are horrible in terms of design. I hate ghouls with weapons…I hate modernity in this kind of games. I preferred the “Nocturne” ghouls with thompsons haha! they had more style.\n- Lack of turn around button (at least I didn't find it during my first playthrough)\n- Lack of option Co-Op. Is not that bad because it helps you to feel helpless but maybe for a DLC it would be great.\n- In this era of "Souls" games it would be great to see more options for the checkpoint system.\n- Bad AI (sometimes) and lame difficulty at moments (in “Survival Mode” wich is considered “normal)\n- The “cast” is not bad but I wished more characters involved…and more clothes states / variations during the story. BTW they could have helped Jennifer Carpenter to make a better role more fittable for her personality.\n\nI was expecting something less predictable and darker. Something different from RE4,5 and 6 with more puzzle solving and twisted plot. But no matter what are the cons. It's a good game wich I want to play a few more times :)","November 29, 2014","true","21.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You play a detective who is trapped inside a nightmare world, where every door leads to a different memory, as you try to find the source of the evil to escape.\n\nThe nightmare world is a long series of traumas, seeming to come from the minds of everyone trapped in there. For example you find notes that fill in the backstory of the detective, and in conversations with other characters you get a good picture of who he is, and the tragedies he has experienced. It’s done with brevity and intelligence. The game assumes you can read between the lines, and that you’re paying attention. The story, just like everything else about the game, was a pleasant surprise to me. It uses the lessons Silent Hill 2 taught on how you do psychological horror. Not everything is explained, but there’s enough there that it makes sense. The designs aren’t random, not done for simply for shock value. They have stories. They’re memories, as the person whose mind you’re inhabiting interpreted them. Or they’re others who came the nightmare before you. Ultimately the story isn't as strong as Silent Hill 2, as it doesn't have the same sort of punch to the end. But there was enough here to elevate it way above the average game.\n\nYour character is weak, capable of carrying only a few bullets. The scarce resources put you on edge, but it’s only the perception of difficulty. The game isn’t frustrating. You always have enough health and ammo. And if you don’t there’s alternative methods to deal with enemies. Yet the illusion of danger still works. It’s brilliant in that regard, just like Resident Evil 4 was.\n\nNo location or scenario in the game overstays its welcome. Even before you get tired of a place, it changes things up. It has stealth sequences, action set pieces in sprawling arenas, quiet exploration, and parts where you run from an overwhelming enemy. All of them happening just when you need them, and in perfect dosage. It doesn’t overdo the action, as that can become mind numbing. Instead the game has an uncanny sense of just how much the audience can tolerate before the intended effect is diminished.\n\nIt never runs out of ideas. It keeps giving you new things to see, and new types of monsters to deal with. As you’re playing you make assumptions about where the game is headed based on other games. You think it’s going to settle into a groove and coast with the same stuff to the end. But it never does. It gives you just enough of one thing, and then surprises you. The sense of pacing is so good, that it makes every other singleplayer game look amateurish. All those dull middle sections in The Last of Us, or Alien Isolation could have been fixed, had those developers had the same sense for how the audience would react like Shinji Mikami does. This is how you make a long game. Every level, every area, every encounter serves a purpose for the whole. Not even short 1-3 hour games do pacing this well, and The Evil Within maintains this quality for the entire 15 hour run.\n\nThis is the greatest achievement of the game, how the tension builds and releases perfectly. The game knows when you need a story beat to remember why you should care, and just long those cutscenes should be. I never felt the need to take a break from playing the game, because those breaks were included in the game itself. The game doesn’t get enough credit for this. I almost can’t emphasize enough just what a revelatory difference the pacing made for my enjoyment of the game. Playing it felt easy. I could just keep going. The second I had an inkling of fatigue the game changed things up and sparked my interest again. Why can’t other games be like this?\n\nRecommending The Evil Within is easy. If you want to play a horror action game, this is as good as it gets. It’s not perfect. The ending could’ve been better. But the journey there was outstanding.","December 7, 2014","true","22.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","5"

Thankfully this game gives you the option of difficulty settings, because this game gets incredibly difficult in many parts. Difficulty is something I enjoy. Beating this game on Nightmare was quite literally a nightmare. The graphics are incredible, but you have to have an incredible computer to play this game anywhere over 30 FPS above 1280x720. People say the character development was iffy, but this game, like many games developed in Japan, has a lot of mystery. You might be enjoying the gameplay, but there's a lot of subliminal plot ques that you might miss on in the first playthrough. Of course now there's DLC that spells out the story so you have that.\n\nTL;DR: I strongly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a psychologically disturbing, difficult, and terrifying game with a really high end gaming computer build in year 2020.","December 10, 2015","true","54.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It felt like something new and innovative.\n+ The gameplay feels like Resident Evil 4. You can upgrade your abilities and weapons the way you like.\n+ There are 4 different difficulties.\n+ Once you played through the game you can start a New Game+ with all your upgraded weapons.\n+ The voice acting is okay. Sometimes the main character lacks emotion in his voice.\n+ You visit a lot of different areas during the game and though it looks chaotic at first it makes sense in the end, trust me.\n+ The achievements of the game are not too easy and not too hard to get.\n+ One of the chapters gave me a really uneasy feeling. You feel like you are constantly haunted and you know someone is watching you. THIS is how horror games should be like. Further there is boss that is constantly hunting you down and that boss gave me the shivers!\n\nCon:\n- Though the story is innovative the producers fail to tell it in a proper way. They added some other plots around the main story and that felt totally misplaced and some characters made no real sense to me until i looked up there motives in the internet. Further you need ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLCs to understand it completely -.-\n- In my opinion there are way too many trial and error parts. You try something, you die, you start anew.\n- There are too many enemies that kill you with one hit.\n- There are too many traps. They are everywhere!\n- Once you've completed 66% of the game the enemies learn how to use guns. This is so annoying and this happens in way too many zombie games. From that point forth the game turns into a wanna-be action game but it just doesnt work. The game failed at the last 33%.\n- Sometimes it feels like the producers added some gameplay parts just for the sake of having them. For example you sit on a stationary machine gun for 20 seconds or you drive a car for 10 seconds. That was absolutely unnecessary...\n- Do not upgrade Melee strength, this perk is totally useless. I don't know why they added this in the first place.\n\nSteam offers this game for 60 bucks. The DLCs combined have a price of 25 bucks. Is the game worth that price? Absolutely NOT. I bought it on a sale for 8€ and that was totally okay. But 60... hahaha...hell no. All in all I'd still recommend it during a sale.","December 15, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I haven't tried turning the difficulty down, but on normal it's pretty difficult.\n\nThe only negative I can give is there aren't really any difficult puzzles.  Mostly difficult combat.

The Fog and Smoke effects in The Evil Within are also amazing....  ..so amazing that it actually caused a bit of a slow down for me.\n\nOften i find myself stopping to look at something or to take a screenshot, because the way the visuals are balanced with the art-direction is quite stunning, the haunting atmosphere and the dismal settings and just that overall feeling that even the walls themselves could cause bodily harm, -hits home for me in the aesthetics department of video game design.\n\nEverything from the floor-boards to the rafters looks like a painstaking amount of time was devoted to making sure the smallest detail; including some random sticky-note on a desk appeared like it would something a player would stop to look at.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that virtually nothing is wasted visually with the environments, everything looks placed accordingly to it's proper setting and there are no bare spots of washed-out nothingness or empty corners. There always seems to be something the character can look at and it feels like the object you are looking at matters or attributes to the game-world somehow.\n\nThe creepy vibe and deliberate grainy washed effects add layer upon layer of horror awesomeness that i have yet to even begin to be able to verbalize in my daily activities.\n\nAlthough for me the issue mostly takes a back seat personally, the Graphics and Optimization options are lacking quite a bit in this title, and yes, it is a pretty resource intensive game, but with good reason, the Tessellation and Mega-textures are all system-locked, and cannot be scaled back to allow a wider variety of GPU's to render everything without slow-downs.\n\nSimply put, the prettiest aspects of the game visuals are kind of all locked in and even if one turned all the options down, the Texture quality and even most of the shader quality would not change, so this can make it a frustrating experience for mid-range gaming PC owners.\n\nIn all honesty, the Graphics optimization, or lack-there-of, is quite possibly The Evil Within's only low-point.  Which can only mean good news for Bethesda and Tango if they get on the ball and figure out a way to patch the PC version with a Optimization hot-fix.\n\n\nSound & Musical Score:\n\n\nGameplay & Control Mechanics:\n\n\nReplay Value:","October 16, 2014","true","53.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

Though it somewhat tries to be scary with how limited your ammo is and some segments of the game where it's the best idea to do some stealth to sneak past or stealth kill enemies so your playthough would be less troublesome.. I stopped playing this game for a while simply because on how frustrating on some parts of the game though eventually I managed to beat the game.\n\nOne frustrating part is where you have to keep your head down from a helter skelter with a blade that can decapitate you if you don't sneak quick enough, when you get shot or hit by enemies, decapitation comes seconds after and that burning feel where you get decapitated.\n\nThe gameplay resolves around in a third person shooter manner much like Dead Space and Kane & Lynch games. You can have multiple guns to collect; you have med kits, stimpacks, even brain juice to augument your abilities and there are enemies that can instantly kill you if you are not careful enough. Plus you have matches to light enemies on fire while they are down on ground so they wont go back up and try to kill you.\n\nIf I have a postive say about this: The enemies in the game are possibly one of the most ****** up designs for a survival horror done good; the music and sounds are okay.. There are fairly good puzzles and really hard ones to figure out as well so it's a good effort to try to make a complex proceedure.\n\nI didn't enjoy this game as much as I felt like I should: It was okay but wasted potential for what it is.. It's like trying to keep up with Resident Evil and Silent Hill by combining the two elements to try to make something original. It's missing on a few elements on what makes a survival horror scary and also it can be rather linear on top of that as well.\n\nShould you buy it?\nIt's up to you but If you are; I'd wait until the steam sales for it comes up and get it at a good price though I don't know about the DLC since I managed to beat the game without them. Though I wouldn't buy DLC for this game regardless on how cheap it is either..

Thankfully this game gives you the option of difficulty settings, because this game gets incredibly difficult in many parts. Difficulty is something I enjoy. Beating this game on Nightmare was quite literally a nightmare. The graphics are incredible, but you have to have an incredible computer to play this game anywhere over 30 FPS above 1280x720. People say the character development was iffy, but this game, like many games developed in Japan, has a lot of mystery. You might be enjoying the gameplay, but there's a lot of subliminal plot ques that you might miss on in the first playthrough. Of course now there's DLC that spells out the story so you have that.\n\nTL;DR: I strongly recommend this game to anybody who enjoys a psychologically disturbing, difficult, and terrifying game with a really high end gaming computer build in year 2020.","December 10, 2015","true","54.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It felt like something new and innovative.\n+ The gameplay feels like Resident Evil 4. You can upgrade your abilities and weapons the way you like.\n+ There are 4 different difficulties.\n+ Once you played through the game you can start a New Game+ with all your upgraded weapons.\n+ The voice acting is okay. Sometimes the main character lacks emotion in his voice.\n+ You visit a lot of different areas during the game and though it looks chaotic at first it makes sense in the end, trust me.\n+ The achievements of the game are not too easy and not too hard to get.\n+ One of the chapters gave me a really uneasy feeling. You feel like you are constantly haunted and you know someone is watching you. THIS is how horror games should be like. Further there is boss that is constantly hunting you down and that boss gave me the shivers!\n\nCon:\n- Though the story is innovative the producers fail to tell it in a proper way. They added some other plots around the main story and that felt totally misplaced and some characters made no real sense to me until i looked up there motives in the internet. Further you need ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ DLCs to understand it completely -.-\n- In my opinion there are way too many trial and error parts. You try something, you die, you start anew.\n- There are too many enemies that kill you with one hit.\n- There are too many traps. They are everywhere!\n- Once you've completed 66% of the game the enemies learn how to use guns. This is so annoying and this happens in way too many zombie games. From that point forth the game turns into a wanna-be action game but it just doesnt work. The game failed at the last 33%.\n- Sometimes it feels like the producers added some gameplay parts just for the sake of having them. For example you sit on a stationary machine gun for 20 seconds or you drive a car for 10 seconds. That was absolutely unnecessary...\n- Do not upgrade Melee strength, this perk is totally useless. I don't know why they added this in the first place.\n\nSteam offers this game for 60 bucks. The DLCs combined have a price of 25 bucks. Is the game worth that price? Absolutely NOT. I bought it on a sale for 8€ and that was totally okay. But 60... hahaha...hell no. All in all I'd still recommend it during a sale.","December 15, 2015","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Those familiar with Shinji Makami's work will feel right at home. To those who don't know who he is, if you enjoyed Resident Evil 4, you will most likely enjoy Makami's latest work. The game is capped at 30, but there is an option to cap it a 60 which requires an unnecessary amount of power under the hood. Nontheless, this is one of my favorite steam games of all time, both as a Makami fan and as a gamer alike.\n\nPros:\n-Old school survival horror\n-LOTS of blood and gore\n-more blood\n-limited resource management\n-lots of small innuendos paying tribute to the Resident Evil series if you pay close attention\n-great replay value (new game+, unlocked weapons, etc)\n\nCons:\n-Unnecessary amount of power needed to run at max settings\n-Lots of loop holes in the story (DLC?)\n-Boss Recycling\n\nAll in all it's a great addition to any survival horror fan.

The art is very well featured in the levels and definitely captures that horror genre feel. The damage modeling is without peer, perhaps some of the best in the industry right now. Top all the lovely art off with some RE4-styled combat, and you have the fun parts of Evil Within.\n\nThat being said though, all of this can not save this title mired by horrific (read: bad) writing featuring forgettable protagonists AND forgettable antagonists. The design is nightmarish (read: bad) display of no how not to do it: the set pieces and scenarios this game dumps you into are so utterly uninteresting that it is a bit of a struggle to get through this game.\n\nWorse, when it isn't uninteresting, it is extremely infuriating. For a game touting itself as "survival horror", you don't have many options regarding alternate methods to dealing with situations. There is a lot of trial and error, much of which is spent trying to figure out how the developer/designer wanted you to complete that set piece.\n\nI suggest avoiding this title.

Enda poolt lisaksin adventure ja mystery. Jaapanis tuntakse mängu Psycho Breaki nime all. Tegemist on ainult üksikmängija mänguga, mis maksab Steamis 60 eurot. Mängu arendajaks on Tango Gameworks, mis loodi 2010dal aastal vana Resident Evili seeria loojate poolt ning 2014 oktoobril tuli nende esimene mäng, milleks ongi The Evil Within. Mängu avaldajaks tuntud Bethesda Softworks. Mainin ära, et Steamis olev tagasiside on mostly postitive, täpsemalt öeldes 77% postitiivne. Kas see ka tõele vastab, seda saate kohe käesolevas ülevaates teada.\nMängus kehastad Sebasstiani, kes on kogenud dektetiiv. Teda aitavad kolleegid Kidman ja Joseph. Lugu algab sellega, et hakkate koos oma uurima massimõrva vaimuhaiglas. Kohale jõudes avastatakse, et kõik haigla töötajad koos politseijõududega on mõrvatud. Mõni hetk hiljem on Sebastian teadvuseta ja ärkab segases Krimson Citys, kus toimuvad maavärinad, maastikunihked ning liiguvad ringi erinevad kurjad olendid. Ta kohtab seal arsti Marcelot, kes otsib enda patsienti Lesliet. Kui Sebastian leiab doktoriga Leslie, siis nad kohtuvad ka Ruvikuga, kellel tundub olevat kontroll reaalsuse üle. Ta suudab teleportida ning muuta maastiku ja keskkonda. Ta lahutab dektetiivitrio ning püüab Sebastiani lõksu. Mis aga edasi juhtub, jätan ma teie endi avastada.\nKui kritiseerida mängu graafikat, siis tegelaste näoilmed ja emotsioonid oleks võinud olla paremad, või tähendab, neid peaaegu polnudk! Loodan, et ei ole suur spoiler, kui ütlen, et mängu edasi jõudmisel satute linnatänavatele.  Just siis tekkis mõte, et kas arendajad väsisid ära või mis juhtus. Linnas olid osad tekstuurid väga madalad ja koledad. Hoolimata sellest oli kõik teised kohad väga ilusad. Alguses tundub graafika kuidagi tuhm ja tume, kuid peale mõnda mängutundi harjute sellega kiiresti. Kuna tegemist on horrormänguga, siis on enesestmõistetav, et oli vaja luua õudsat atmosfääri, mis neil ka väga hästi välja tuli. Hoolimata nendest nõrkustest võib graafikaga rahule jääda ja öelda ,et see on suurepärane.\nNagu eelnevalt mainitud, on loojad tegelenud ka Resident Evili seeriaga, millest võib järeldada, et mänge võrreldes leiab sarnasusi. Olen veel lugenud üelvaateid, kus inimesed ütlevad, et tegemist on Residet Evili ja Sient Hilli seguga. Endale meenutas mäng veidike The Last of Us-i. Just selle scavange ja oskuspuu uuendamise pärast. Veel võib võrdlusesse tuua Hitman:Absolutioni, kus peab palju silent kille tegema. Ka The Evil Within-is on silent killid väga tähtsa, kuna nende jaoks ei kulu lastemoona. Keskkonnast leiab elude jaoks süstlaid ja meditsiinipakke. Muud kugutavad esemed on dokumendid, võtmed, kaarditükid, kadunud inimeste postrid, ajalehed ja roheline geel. Roheline geel annab võimaluse Sebastiaeni oskuste uuendamiseks, mida saab teha ainult spetsiaalses kohas – hullumajas. See on spetsiaalne koht uuendusteks, mängu salvestamiseks ja kappide avamiseks. Terve ümbruskond on täis ärapeidetud püüniseid, mille kahjutuks tegemine annab rauadetaile, millest omakorda saab valmistada vibupüssile nooli. Kui kogud kokku ka kõik kaarditükkid, saad suure üllatuse osaliseks. Muidugi leiab maast, kastidest ja muudest kohtadest relvi ja kuule.\nKui õudne see mäng siis reaalselt on? Ütleme nii, et tegemist ei ole mänguga, mille eesmärk on tühiseid jumpscaresi tekitada, vaid eesmärk on rohkem lugu edasi anda, kuid sellegi poolest suudab see üllatada mitmeid korda. Pinget jagub pidevalt, kas siis bossidega võitlemisel või niisama ringi rännates. Ka ühe loading screeni nõuanne on see, et vahel on jooksmine parim lahendus. Pean tunnistama, et ise olen olnud liiga uudishimulik, et mõnda kohta lihtsalt läbi joosta. Tapsin absoluutselt kõik vastased ja otsisin kõikvõimalikest kohtadest endale nodi.\nMinul kulus mängu läbitegemiseks 15 tundi. Terve selle ajajooksul nägin kokku kuni 3 buggi, mis on üsnagi üllatav, kuna steamis liigub palju negatiivset tagasisidet just buggide ja graafika glichide kohta. On jutte ka sellest, et mäng on kinni 30 fpsi peal, aga see ei vasta tõele. Saate rahus nautida just nii hea fpsiga, kui hästi teie arvuti seda mängu jooksutab. Ise kasutasin Nvidia GTX770 videokaarti maksimum sätetel ja mäng jooksis umbes 45-70 kaadrit sekundis. Tundub, et mängu on parandatud ja vastavad uuendused on välja lastud. Koos keskklassi videokaardi ja kõige uuemate draiveritega ei tohiks probleeme tulla.\nKui alustate mängu esimest korda, siis on saadavalt ainult kaks raskus taset: Casual ehk kerge ja Survival ehk keskmine või otsetõlkes normaalne. Peale mängu läbimängimist avanevad uued mängu moodid ja tasemed. Avaneb Nightmare Difficulty ehk raske ja AKUMU mode, mis tähendab seda, et oled surnud ühe löögiga. Ise mängisin terve mängu Survival tasemel. Mäng ütleb ka seda, et taset saab muuta, aga ainult madalamaks. Ehk kui paned Survivali pealt Causalile, siis pead terve edaspidise mängu kerge tasemega läbima. Ka ise kaalusin seda varianti mängu alguses, kuid õnneks ma taset ei madaldanud ja pingutasin lõpuni. Arvan, et raskustasemete süsteem on hästi läbimõeldud ja kutsub kindlasti uuesti mängima. Mängus on ka vahebossid ning lõppboss. Tapmise meetodid on enamjaolt erinevad.\nMida öelda kokkuvõtteks? The Evil Within maksab Steamis 60 eurot, mis on üsnagi krõbe hind, kui arvestada sellega, et tegemist on üksikmängija mänguga. Ise soetasin selle soodusmüügi ajal 9 euroga. Arvan, et mäng ei vääri 60 eurot, kuna sisu pole piisavalt. Sellegipoolest on tegemist ühe hea ja kvaliteetse mänguga. Arvan, et mängu on natuke isegi alahinnatud kuulsate kriitikute poolt. Kui te olete horror mängude fän, siis just see on must paly teie jaoks. Mina paneksin 8/10-st.\n","January 7","true","17.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

The pace changes from an emphasis on stealth, to emphasis on combat, to emphasis on running. It never goes to one extreme: never as helpless as Amnesia, never as actiony as Resident Evil 4.\n\nA lot of thought has been put into small details and the world-building, and while it's not Mikami's best work, it's still a Mikami game, meaning it's very good.

The gameplay style (upgrading items/skills, movement, and keys/controller) truly reminded me of the most recent Tomb Raider game and the atmosphere itself reminds me a little of Silent Hill in a very odd way. The storyline is just amazing - it is the reason I keep coming back. I somehow muster up the courage to play through the grim atmosphere and the sheer horror just to find out what is really going on.\nHowever, if you are looking for lots of jumpscares, then this is not the right game for you.

The art is very well featured in the levels and definitely captures that horror genre feel. The damage modeling is without peer, perhaps some of the best in the industry right now. Top all the lovely art off with some RE4-styled combat, and you have the fun parts of Evil Within.\n\nThat being said though, all of this can not save this title mired by horrific (read: bad) writing featuring forgettable protagonists AND forgettable antagonists. The design is nightmarish (read: bad) display of no how not to do it: the set pieces and scenarios this game dumps you into are so utterly uninteresting that it is a bit of a struggle to get through this game.\n\nWorse, when it isn't uninteresting, it is extremely infuriating. For a game touting itself as "survival horror", you don't have many options regarding alternate methods to dealing with situations. There is a lot of trial and error, much of which is spent trying to figure out how the developer/designer wanted you to complete that set piece.\n\nI suggest avoiding this title. However, if you're a fan of Resident Evil 4, you might want to keep it on your wishlist and wait for a sale - you might like it.","January 31, 2015","false","23.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I have yet to actually be scared by this game. Opening part is the closest but after getting chainsawed by that guy a dozen times you will find you are just annoyed more than scared. Its just another in a long LONG line of zombie shooters. I have heard it said that at any given time there are more people in law school than their are practicing lawyers.

Just wait a month and save 40$ when steam puts it on sale like it is now. The second thing is to avoid games made for consoles, THEN ported over to computer.

MASSIVE.\nFor those who want  TL:DR this is short list for those wanting a bit more depth read on after.\n\n* GREAT HORROR LOOKING LEVELS\n* GREAT ATMOSPHERE\n* GOOD GRAPHICS\n* BAD FRAMERATE\n* BLACK BARS ♥♥♥♥♥♥ THE SCREEN\n* BAD CONTROLS\n* BUGS UP THE WAZOO\n* BLACK SCREEN CRASHES\n\nI want to love this game its very much a resident evil 4 looking game with plenty of gore and atmosphere. Like the first encounter with a proper "psycho" in the basement of a hospital. Its not exactly a scary encounter it feels more like a 10 year olds idea of horror "IT NEEDS CHAINSAWS AND BLOOD" etc. However it does build a very dark tone to start a game and a note to the developers, running from an enemy in a straight line may not be a QTE but its damn well as bad as one, LEAVE THEM OUT!\nThe problems start however from the very beginning, the first cutscene looks so choppy and the characters seem so carboard and lifeless. Now shall i get to the frame rate issues? to make it clear i'm not usually a man who gives into all the frame rate debate but being stuck to 30 and with some points of this game it makes it seem so slow and cumbersome added with the backwards ♥♥♥ controls it just feels lethargic and slow to respond.\ntake for example there are a variety of traps in the game of which can be disarmed so far. The problem i found with these is that the character seems to have a slight give in the movement so that when you have stopped with the input he will dawdle for a bit more meaning  "oh there's a line trap lets go up to that an....." BLAM f**king dead.\nThis again leads to something else i have encountered where upon dying for whatever reason the game may randomly choose then everything is black ... no images nothing only menus, this will continue even to the main menu the only thing so far that fixes it is a full restart which just isnt on.\nFor the sake of keeping it short the worst thing so far in my opinion? the damn FOV and f**king black bars. On a 1080p screen you may see about a few inches strip in the middle. There are ways to sort this as i have with console commands but doing this may reduce the bars but put the unchangeable FOV to looking at your characters back hair for the rest of the game making even me someone who doesnt usually suffer from FOV problems too bad want to turn it off and throw a match on the game... yeah take that game usuing your own thing against you. Just why Bethesda unless this game is patched its a waste of money. An unplayable mess. SORT IT OUT!\n\n\n(Addition after more time and after thought)\nthe shooting mechanics seem so far off aiming wise for example aiming directly at the head doesnt always mean a headshot ( even if they are super satisfying) and the upgrade system just seems off and stupid for some upgrades, shoot this gel into my brain to make me able to hold more bullets ... no why not just get a coat .","October 14, 2014","false","3.2"," 56 of 113 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","56","113","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bazark/recommended/268050/","bazark","Bazark","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bazark/","485 products in account","The first few times I started this game up it crashed immediately after the intro movies. It was only after I force skipped them that I managed to actually start the game, which looking back I now regret having ever accomplished.\n\nLike many I was greeted by the black bars constraining the top and bottom of the screen and immediately sought a menu option to turn this off, because wouldn't it be mad to force such an aspect ratio on a PC game? Apparently, not to the developers of this particular game and again I took to google to fix it with command line launches and the in-game console, very soon I will regret spending so much time and effort to play this game.\n\nThe very first lines of dialogue sound like they were translated through an unfeeling computer who sadly can't comprehend the english language with anything resembling human feeling or emotion. Luckily for that computer the voice actors could apparently not add any of that missing emotion to their performances so in a weird ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way it all fits together and deserves each other. This somehow manages to worsen throughout the game as you encounter more and more characters who are forced to read off such lines as "It's not just about being unable to see, it's about feeling normal" after you retrieve his glasses from a mutant spawn of hell in dog form, oh wonderful I'm so glad I endangered my own life so you could feel normal while we kill the psychotic undead in a hellish landscape juxtaposing medieval architecture and an industrial complex. You feeling normal is REALLY all that matters in this situation.\n\nThe gameplay does nothing to shore up the stilted dialogue and poor story. Stealth is quickly introduced from the onset and then used for 2-3 chapter depending on how willing you are to engage with it and then is swiftly discarded along with any pretense of horror or helplessness you might have felt. Pretty much as soon as you recieve a crossbow through which you can fire many different bolts (some stun and shock, others freeze, one bolt is much like a sticky grenade in function) in probably the only piece of real creativity in the combat, all tension and thrills are discarded for what is mostly a bland third person shooter. The weapons other than the crossbow are by the numbers handgun, shotgun, rife etc. that you will find to function similar to any number of other third person shooters, here you are merely deploying the weapons with sloppy, loose controls and a crosshair that you would swear is just plain lieing to you at times. Things such as a dodge or real melee system is nowhere to be found here, as in order to avoid enemy attacks you must stop aiming and lumberingly reposition, and your melee attacks are as effective as throwing marshmallows at your enemies, who seem only to be momentarily stunned or confused as to why you would even bother. There are some single-use melee weapons to be found strewn about but you simply press the melee button and they are used and disposed of, offering nothing of a real melee combat system to be found.\n\nThe graphics are perfectly adequate once you jettison the black bars and unlock the framerate, the lighting in particular is fairly nice and even exceptional in certain areas, and most of the blood and gore found in the game itself is fairly well rendered as well. I didn't notice any particularily problematic frame drops while playing through the game and it seems mostly stable, even when you take the game out of it's comfort aspect ratio and frame lock. All in all it's a perfectly fine looking game on the PC and I didn't have much trouble or problems with the graphics after the initial tinkering. This, however, can hardly make up for the myriad other problems the game has and there is certainly prettier games out there, and of the horror variety as well, to test your system with.\n\nThe Evil Within is on the whole just not very good. Nothing about it really elevates itself out of it's own pool of wasted potential, poor dialogue and story and dull, by the numbers combat and gameplay. It seems like a game that might have been considered "okay" years ago but shooting has moved on from these slow, lumbering gameplay conventions, horror has moved on from men with chainsaws rushing at you and zombies stuck with bits of barbed wire being scary, stealth especially has moved on from frustrating, slow, trial and error gameplay. You can do better than this on all fronts, and for 66 Canadian dollars? You can probably get 2 or more games that do what The Evil Within does better.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n-Solid framerate and lighting\n-Well rendered guts and gore\n-Different crossbow bolts show small signs of creativity in an otherwise drab selection of weapons\n\nCons:\n-Nonsensical story and stiff, horribly translated dialogue drag the story below B-movie levels into annoying dribble\n-Stealth is frustrating and poorly explained before being almost entirely discarded\n-Combat is boring and dull when not using the crossbow, other weapons are generic mix of shooter standards\n-Horror and tension is mostly cast aside for poorly paced, boring action sequences\n-Without extra work by consumer, game is a buggy mess that could crash at any time or barely start at all\n-Holds to stale genre conventions that have since been discarded or improved upon without adding anything of it's own to the mix\n\nWTF:\n-Do you really expect me to believe a female detective will go out on a call wearing high heels? They're on screen like two times for five seconds but both times I'm now distracted by how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥ I think the character is, what if she has to like run or something? You know from those hordes of zombies coming after you, or even like, chase after a criminal, you know her job that she apparently does?\n-This was really the last place I expected to find a terrible Sephiroth stand-in\n-I made it through 7/14 or so chapters in this game, I guess if it suddenly becomes amazing in those last chapters they did a poor job of making half of their game not suck and so I'm not really sorry about not making it through the whole thing to be honest","October 20, 2014","false","5.5"," 51 of 103 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","51","103","0","0"

The reason being is that their debut title, The Evil Within, is absolutely flooded with performance issues on day 1.  If you're playing on a console, you probably don't give a ♥♥♥♥.  However, if you're a PC who digs smooth animations, frame rate that is tolerable, the ability to PLAY a game, then you want to skip The Evil Within, or at least until Bethesda and Tango does something about it.  Looking at this forum page from a Bethesda admin, that's really not going to be happening anytime soon.  Weird latency with mouse and keyboard at the very beginning at the title menu and options.  The game churns at a frame rate of under 30.  You have to at least have great parts and know your settings if you want to run it at 30.  With an aged PC at about 3-4 years, having to remove video settings still doesn't bump up to 30 (26-27 with Fraps off, 19-22 with Fraps running).  The letterbox in the game is weird because the game itself is forcing less pixels to be on screen, yet it still tanks.  You can fix this with an console command, but unlocking at 60 desyncs the voice acting.  The ability to change the letterbox doesn't remove it, the screen just enlarges to the point that less of the black bar is there.   This is severly unplayable to people who want titles that shoudl work and that shouldn't have us trying to fix the problems that the devs should be doing.  We aren't the devs, Tango is.  If they can't do their jobs, then the company is doomed.  Therefore, I feel sorry for them.  To be honest, seeing that Tango Gameworks is an Asian company, they could care less what the consumers want.\n\nOne final note: my game doesn't even SHOW Tango's logo.  The game acts like it wants to crash after Bethesda's logo.  Well Bethesda, your name is ALL over it.

As I have to take breaks of 40-60mins for the sickness to fade I have been thinking and worked this out;-\n\nAs the game was obviously designed for consoles with the PC port being a shoddy after thought they forgot ONE MAJOR thing. PC gamers sit with thier head only a couple of feet from their screen. Console gamers play on thier TV several feet away.\n\nThats it. That is why the black bars look crap on the PC version, it is because even a very large monitor is going to be on average no more then about 27" and so we are looking at only a small amount of screen due the bars. Console gamers have 45-55" viewing estate to look at.\n\nThis is also the exact reason for MOTION SICKNESS, Pc gamers are so close to the screen that the head bob seems massivly exaggerated. Console gamers are again of course so far away that it does not effect them in the same way.\n\nNow DEVs that design games only for PC are aware of these factors and so DO NOT stick black bars in cos it seems 'hipster' and 'artsy' as they realize it will ruin the immersion. They also know that head bob causes motion sickness in many players so the vast majority of them offer a slider option to reduce the effect or even switch it off.\n\nThe fact these option are not present for the PC version confirms my worst fears in that this game is just a bad console port with little or no care or thought for the entire PC gaming community.\n\nMy advice for you would be to copy and past this message on any forum you feel like and any youtube video you feel like until the DEVS listen to us and fix these things. They ar enot difficult problems to fix, but will cost them money to get a programer to code.\n\nWe will see if the DEVS put profit above all else or if they will listen to our concerns. Mr Shinji Mikami's entire reputation in the PC gaming world rests on the outcome of the 'fixes' or 'options' they add to the game.\n\nAs of now I have told everyone I know not to buy the game in its current state\n\n-edit-\n\n(for the few minutes I've been able to play it without the motion sickness it seems like a good game but I've not played enough to be able to really comment on it.

It's ok except for some really annoying bosses.  The most frequent occurring boss is this spider-lady who appears every couple of chapters, and you're actually only supposed to fight and kill her once - every other time you have to run.  And even when you DO kill her when you're supposed to, she just shows up later in the game anyway.  She also one hit kills you.\n\nAlso, there is a boss at the end of chapter 10, who has a 2nd form that is very fast and one hit kills you - takes about 45 minutes to beat him after retrying over and over, and watching youtube strategies.  If you don't have a huge stack of ammo stashed away for him, you will be screwed.  Luckily, I had stored a huge arsenal, but if I didn't have that, I don't know how I would've been able to beat him.\n\nThere are some decent boss fights in the game, but the annoying ones really sour the experience - enough so that I don't recommend the game.\n\nThe main problem with a lot of the boss fights is the same problem with Resident Evil 6 - half the time you're supposed to kill the enemies, half the time you're supposed to run.  If you guess wrong, and try to kill a boss when you're actually supposed to run - well, you've just wasted a ton of ammo.","August 22, 2015","false","43.7"," 23 of 47 people (49%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","49","23","47","0","3"

It's disturbing but definitely not scary. And it feels like a game from 10 years ago in terms of graphics and gameplay. There is no actual storyline and the characters and voice acting is terrible. I've played over 4 hours and it was the worst 4 hours ever. I almost cried of the thought that I bought this game for 50 euros.\n\nThe game is extremely buggy. Memory leaks, fps drops, bad A.I., collision problems (you can seriously walk through bosses), glitches, bugged checkpoints and so on... Not to mention the 30fps lock and almost no PC options. It's a bad PC port.\n\nSome of the design choices are absolutely re tarded. For example bombs and traps were put in the game to fight of hordes of zombies, it has nothing to do with the world or the story(if there's any). So when you spot a lot of traps and bombs you know that there is a sequence with excessive amount of zombies... It totallly kills the suspension.\n\nOh and the bombs are annoying as hell. I mean who the f places bombs near windows and doors? What the hell is the point of that. Not to mention the bombs doesn't go off when a zombie comes near it. Also wearing a torch doesn't give you the option to burn bodies but ONLY matches will set the freaking bodies on fire. And I can continue talking about those ridiculous design decisions. It's the typical japanese game that attempts to be a western game.\n\nSeriously buy only this game if it's like below 10 dollars or if you like to get kicked in the balls.","October 14, 2014","false","4.5"," 22 of 45 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","22","45","0","0"

Here's my honest and unbiased review.\n\n-Gameplay\nOverall, the Gameplay feels very smooth, there are very few flaws far and in between, and even if they were, they were too small to notice. As you no doubt already know, ammo is exceedingly scarce, and more often that not you're always making decisions whether or not to go straight head on and risk extra ammo in favor of health, or take the stealthy path and go for a sneak kill, or to avoid the fight entirely and hide or escape. The enemies are not the only threat, there are various traps around the environment that can actually be used to your advantage. Again, I find myself making decisions again, should I disarm this trap for my crossbow or should I leave it there and trick my enemies into it. The game comprises of these seemingly minor decisions that ultimately will break or make your character. On the downside, your main weapon, which is the pistol, doesn't always go smoothly. The aim is not exact and the bullet doesn't necessarily hit where you intend to. This can cause trouble in longer ranged fights in which ammo is already scarce; you cannot be affording to miss headshots or shots altogether completely. This might make things harder to deal with, as you're only allowed a maximum of 16 bullets minus upgrades. 8.5/10\n\n-Visual\nThe game's graphics and cutscenes are absolutely topnotch, just what'd you expect from a next gen game. Many details are brought to life, such as insects in the environment, and shadows casting on the walls actually tell you where your enemies are facing, which is an important gameplay mechanic when you're enemies are outside your line of sight but you need to sneak pass them or get behind them. The only issue about the graphics is mainly the main character's lack of expression. When he is attacked, he shows minor signs of change, and it doesn't reflect the pain that is inflicted upon him.\n8/10\n\n-Story\nI will not spoil anything here at all, however what I can say is, if you're expecting a story in which everything is fed to you and that you can understand it in one playthrough, you're going to be disappointed. The story is deep and complex, albeit it becomes a point where it is unnecessary and clunky in certain areas, and it feels too ambitious. The story isn't just given to you in the form of cutscenes, hidden throughout the stage are audio logs and notes, in which you might have to do more exploration in order to uncover them. This makes it slightly less obvious and it obscures certain facts. However I believe that this is a game that makes the story more complete in the form of sequels, and to take it all in in one sitting may be too much for one to bear.\n6/10\n\n-Verdict\nThe Evil Within is a very unique experience, although its game mechanics are nothing new, (Stealth, backstabbing, disarming traps and hiding in closets) The Evil Within does an excellent and fantastic job to blend all these together, and overall, I daresay there hasn't been such a proper survival horror game since Resident Evil 4. The lack of ammo, the overwhelmingly stronger enemies, the variety of enemies and locations all blend together perfectly. Nothing is left to chance and almost everything is determined by the player's choice and skill. The story isn't complete and there are questions you have that will be unanswered, yet I believe it is the sort of game that uncovers more through the sequels. All in all, I highly recommend The Evil Within to new and old fans alike. For old fans, there are many similarities with Resident Evil 4. and if you're familiar with Shinji Mikami's works there are many points in the game that will feel familiar to you and you will feel right at home. For the newer fans, the game might seem bizarre and alien to you, although it doesn't feel unnatural or out of place. Everything fits like clockwork and runs perfectly and smoothly. My final verdict for this game, is a 9/10.","October 14, 2014","true","14.6"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/recommended/268050/","eliamoroes","Elia Moroes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eliamoroes/","221 products in account","The Evil Within is a horror videogame developed by Shinji Mikami, the man behind the famous Resident Evil series. The story of the game revolves around police detective Sebastian Castellanos and his two partners as they visit a mental hospital where a murder occurred only to find themselves trapped into an allucination world of some sort controlled by a very deranged mind, with no apparent way out.\nWhile the Evil Within has been heavily advertised (especially by its director, Mikami) as a return to the survival horror formula, as it was to be expected by the creator of the Resident Evil series, the game is in fact an ACTION horror game: you are pretty much tasked to destroy the various monsters blocking your path and not elude or hide from them. Unfortunately for the player, however, Sebastian, the playable character, is indeed a typical survival horror protagonist, with his limited movements, low health and scarce resources. This great gameplay design flaw really ruins the Evil Within as a whole and is the source of many, far too many frustrating moments through the whole experience. While frustration and a general sense of hoepelessness are core elements of a horror game, they are less acceptable when they are due to bad design choices. I'll try to list the most glaring issues below:\n- The first and second chapters of the game introduces stealth mechanics to the player and stealth is indeed vital to overcome them both, regardless of the difficulty. Starting from as early as chapter three, however, stealth is tossed out completely from gameplay in favor of straight fights with the monsters. Generally speaking, stealth doesn't serve much of a purpose if enemies spawn directly onto your character and the bosses are straight combat-oriented. Also (but fittingly, in a way), no update whatsoever allows stealth to be more viable through the various chapters\n- The game is very survival horror-ish when it comes to resource managements: as to say, you will find little resources through the various areas. While you can somehow deal with few healing items or grenades, the same cannot be said for the ammo of your weapons, which you will ALWAYS find yourself in need for more and more. While this issue can be somehow mitigated by specific updates (like headshots being more prone to outright kill enemies or a weapon being able to carry more bullets), correct ammo management becomes essential. Relaying on your melee attack also doesn't work as an ammo-saving strategy, since, on top of being remarkably weak and expose yourself to a counterattack, most of the time it'll just put enemies down just for them to stand up again moments later (something that can be negated with headshots or setting them on fire with matches)\n- The checkpoints in this game are very incosistent, to say the least. In the first chapters you pretty much have to clear huge areas from enemies stealthly without any checkpoints in-between: so if you get spotted or killed it's back to square one for you (and you have to collect all goodies along the way again). Later in the game, checkpoints have a nasty habit to place themselves just before unskippable custscenes or just before a puzzle: in the latter's case if you die by an enemy attack just moments after solving the puzzle, you have to solve it again\n- True to Japanese horror videogames fashion, this game spots very cheap deaths from time to time, as to say instances where, be it because you don't know what to do right off the bat or the game decides to just ambush you, you are going to die and have to restart from the last checkpoint. This becomes increasingly frustrating as the checkpoints start to appear far away between each other\n- The game features a variety of traps that will blow up and inflict massive damage on you if you don't take steps to disarm them beforehead. The issue here is about you needing to place yourself in precise spots near the wire traps to disarm them (else, they will go boom) and the mines being extremely difficult to set off (and should you fail, the mine will explode). It's also worth mentioning that there are far too many instances where said traps are right behind a corner and undetectable till you run into them and turned to pieces (see above)\n- The bosses in this game have a rather unique design and are more akin to puzzle bosses: instead of just shooting them to death, you have to figure out how to arm them first and cheese it for all it's worth. The issue here is that said weaknesses can be rather obscure at times and, more importantly, all the bosses are downright damage sponges, capable of eating several pounds of ammo each. Given the above mentioned general scarcity of it for the whole game, it's not uncommon to find yourself in the middle of a boss fight without anything else to throw at the boss. It also doesn't help that each boss have its own one-hit kill attack that can and WILL use with gay abandon, and youc character's control scheme makes dodging and evading painfully slow and unrelayable\nAll the issues I listed above can't be somehow mitigated choosing the right difficulty level. At the beginning of the game you can choose only between Casual (which is the easy difficulty setting, althought that isn't saying much, given it had to be nerfed after launch) and Survival (the normal difficulty). After beating the game, on top of bonus overpowered weapons and a sort of New Game +, you can play on Nightmare (hard setting) and AKUMU (one hit and your character dies).\nAnother glaring issue of the Evil Within is the way the main story goes along as you go deeper in the game. Several hours in the game there is really no plot to speak of: you know for a fact the characters are trapped into an illusionary world and there is a sociopathic killer pulling the strings, but the whole things just seems to keep going by itself and nothing more. The game does add more plot elements later on, but even in the end several questions and important plot points are left in the dark and the characters' interactions minimal.\nTo its credit, the Evil Within spots some incredible and genuinely unsettling environments and enemies design most of the time, althought they seem to both lose their consistency towards the final sequences, where the game decides to reuse several assets from previous levels and everything drags on far longer than it should. The final boss is also more atmospheric and bombastic than it is challenging and/or satisfying to beat and throws the game's general gameplay out of the window.\nThe first two DLC packs, the Assignment and the Consequences, follow the story of Sebastian's partner Juli Kidman as she tries to survive the event of the game from their own personal prospective and fullfill a secret mission of a sort for her shadowy employers. The DLCs, in a way, fix nearly all the issues of the base game: for starters, Kidman isn't as skilled in combat as Sebastian, forcing her to relay EXCLUSIVELY on stealth to survive the various dangerous monsters she comes across. On top of being more stealth (and survival horror) oriented, both the Assignment and the Consequences go out of their way to clarify many plot elements from the base game and features more consistent checkpoints. The two DLCs clock around four or five hours together (they are two parts of a single story and should be played together) and are definitely suggested.\nThe Executioner DLC puts you in the shoes of a Keeper (a boss from the base game) as it battles hordes of monsters and takes on several bosses from the main campaign, armed with a variety of unlockable weapons. On top of being rather short (cloking around one hour or so), there is nothing in the DLC aside from pure cathartic factor\nThe Evil Within remains one of the most frustrating videogames I've ever played and a very poor attempt at mixing together action and stealth in a horror game, with results that do nothing but to frustrate the player every step of the way","July 20, 2015","false","23.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","13","27","0","0"

Are you going to be able to live with yourself knowing the things I'm gonna make you do?" and "I created this world, you cannot keep me here.". I expected a game that would continue to get darker as we explored the Mindscape of the antagonist. The game also advertised "Changing environments that react to players choice" < that's a lie, the game cannot be more linear even if it tried. I expected hellish creatures , high tension and actual survival... which the game provides none. The enemy A.I is so bad, you can actually outrun most of the monsters in those "Linear Chapters" or exit the room in which they are where they won't decide to follow you. In the beginning the game will seem promising, but by the end of chapter 3 the game gives you access to two of the most useful weapons in the game (the shotgun and the magical crossbow)  which are simply overpowered and take all the sense of "vulnerability" that the game had nurtured early on in this dark forest and abandoned village settings... now you know you can take on anything or simply out run it.\nThe biggest disappointment comes when you get to the "shoot em up" chapters, which is basically you fighting hordes and hordes of enemies... in broad daylight. There are like 5 chapters like this.\n\nAnd that's my problem with the game, it tries to be so many things at once... It had so much potential.\nIf you compared chapter 1-3 to the shoot-em-up chapters you'd think that they are two different games.\nAlso the "I created this world" line is a lie, basically the evil within is an adventure through someone's "memories" with some godly manipulation that teleports the character.\n\nI could go on and on, Also the ending leaves so many plotholes, that it isn't worth the trouble.\n\n---Pro\n+ Beautiful Environments\n+ Nurse Tatiana's Apathy\n+ Chapter 9 and 10\n---Cons\n+ Clunky aiming that makes you miss enemies even at point blank.\n+ Shoot em up segments, by the time you get to the ending chapters of the game... you'll unlock the | You've killed 200 enemies achievements |\n+ Many Story Plotholes\n+ Pointless Adventure with no sense of progression.\n+ Re-used enemies , over and over, and over\n+ A lot of Nonsense, example like: You can use your knife for stealth-kills , but you cannot use the knife to defend yourself even if you have 0 ammo.\n\nIn the end, if you liked Resident Evil 4 much more than Resident Evil 1 , then this game is for you. If you thought this game was going to be a psychological tense horror thriller ... no , then this game is not for you. Even Silent Hill is much more confusing than this game's story. The game loses it sense of horror and tension once you reach Chapter 5, the game becomes predictable afterwards and you can use your right to the second ammendment to shoot out everything.","November 30, 2014","false","15.2"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

I'll continue with the game but oh boy its painful its definitely 'evil' lol.","December 8, 2015","false","3.3"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","12","25","0","0"

If you had your fun with Dead Space For example you should consider buying this game when it is 25-50% off.\n\nGraphic Quality is not the top, Black borders on top and bottom of the screen and so on are of course there, but you get used to it pretty quick. Besides, if you play a game only for the fancy graphics, you should go back to your CoD or BF. Also there were trailer which do not differ from the actual graphic. Black bars were also a thing long known.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, it pretty much is like RE4 (Quick Time Events, Aiming) but optimized for pc. It does delay on some places which makes it ridiculous hard to disarm bombs for example, but works fine otherwise. You can even go around and stealth kill the enemies which makes it easier on some points for the AI let them act like they are actual zombies, but only 100 time more idiotic.\n\nThe sounds and voice acting is good, but at some points it sounds like they did the good old record and repeat.\n\nYou start with a rather small inventory when it comes to ammo etc. which can be upgraded.\n\nUpgrades must be purchased for "Brain Points?" which are scattered across the map and enemies.\nYou can upgrade the character, his weapons, his inventory and/or his bolts.\nI saw some reviews saying this is bad, but again, in RE4 it was nothing different, you found money on enemies which you used to upgrade your weapons, so i dont get what most peoples problems are with the game.\n\nTL;DR People crying about the game having no fancy graphics. It is a good time waster , but not the mega hyped game everybody expected to get.","October 14, 2014","true","19.9"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

I played it up to (what I assume) was near the ending. However I simply cannot recommend it in its current state, the bugs, the crashes, important event objects that don't load and completely break the game simply make this an unplayable mess as it is.\n\nThe game is extremely atmospheric, the story and characters are interesting and engaging and the actual gameplay is very enjoyable. The one part that completely ruined it for me though is a part of the game in chapter 11. An object that is integral to progression would not load no matter how many times I restarted the chapter/checkpoint. I COULD NOT FINISH THE GAME due to this bug which is disgusting and immensely disappointing to me. Therefore, unless you are absolutely certain you can risk it,\n\nTl:dr I do not recommend buying this game for eighty dollars. If you are going to charge full price for a game, please make certain that the consumer can ACTUALLY play the entire game.","October 19, 2014","false","7.9"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","0"

Those were fun.\n\nThe Evil Within isn't fun.  It's tedious.  Tedious and unscary -- as if in the mind of the people who made it, that was somehow going to make it frightening.  It isn't frightening.  At all.  It is gross, yes.  The graphics convey a good atmosphere... but that all becomes meaningless as the game controls and gameplay will destroy any sense of foreboding the game could offer.\n\nNow, I don't regret buying the game as I got it on sale and I was curious enough to see what it was about.  I'm glad I did, too.  But I can't recommend it to anyone except maybe to die hard horror fans who want to have a look at it and see.

Shinji is looking for that real old school - grindhouse horror feel. No one says you have to like this game, he delivered on all his promises, sure the PC reccomendations and specs are abit overboard? But thats not to say you cant run the game and have FUN its about fun not visual, all though the visuals help with immerions and atmospeheric tension. This does not mean you cant have fun with this game.\nI think there is plenty on offer here and it is completely worth its price tag  and is worthy of a Survival horror place as well as one of the better Shinji games in the past few years.\n\nIf you like survival horror at its roots e.g Resi 4, last of us esque you'll feel some what at home here\n9.5/10","October 16, 2014","true","16.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

Haven't seen you around this desolate land known as "The Evil Within Community Reviews-vile". Now, now I know what you are thinking. What is up with all these thumbs downs? Is this game so bad? Why no, friend, it isn't. In fact The Evil Within is an amazing game created by one of the most creative minds in gaming: Shinji Mikami. Then how come people are so negative on Steam? Well here are a few points of interest:\n\n1. The game does have some technical issues. It is locked at 30 FPS command console and there are these black bars around the screen that can take some time to get used to...or not. This just in: a new patch released a short while ago and fixed both of these issues. So...um...yeah. Chalk that one up as an invalid complaint.\n\n2. No really there is not other actual reason to hate on The Evil Within. Well yeah the story is standard fare for the genre but that is hardly that big of a issue for a game where everything else is amazing.\n\n3. Seriously buy this game. It has a terrific atmosphere, art design, interestingly thought out enemy encounters and awesome gunplay.\n\nHope that helps.","October 16, 2014","true","25.5"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The game gives you the means to dispatch most things in your path but gives you very little room for error and rewards clever use of environmental hazards and your own equipment which is scarse at best.

The Evil Within has an excellent story, very solid game mechanics, and a terrifying atmosphere. It is a classic Japanese/Shinji survival horror title with a focus on ammo limitation and tense situations to bring a type of anxiety that will keep you coming back.\n\nThe story gains meaning as as it progresses, and will gain additional meaning on a second playthrough. There are collectibles (keys and map pieces) to encourage a playthrough of New Game+, as well as speed run achievements and the Akumu (one hit kill) difficulty to keep yourself challenged. If you are a fan of survival horror titles such as Resident Evil or Silent Hill, take negative reviews with a grain of salt. The same negative reviewers likely complained that you couldn't see through the fog in Silent Hill.","October 16, 2014","true","75.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

No jumping, can't sprint for more than 5 metres, slow reaction time etc etc.\nThe camera angles are ridiculous as a 3rd person game. Quite often you simply can not see what you're doing or where you're going etc. Often needing to standup or show yourself to the mobs, simply so you can work out where you're going.\n3rd person view kills this game!\nAs stated you simply have no real sense of control or being there.  There is no easy way to aim on objects etc, and quite often you have to do the left and right shuffle before you can pickup or use an item.\nIts basically a stealth game as the bad guys are far stronger, better weopens, and senses than the player. Shooting them 4 or 5 times only makes them angry.\nGraphics are good, and at the 60 FPS it ran well with most graphic options turned up.  I am running and i7 with 16GB etc so it should.\nTheres virtually no saving except for some odd ball locations, hence you will find that you are constantly regoing over the same scene again and again and again and again. Becomes monotonous.\nSeems to run fairly well, with the latest updates, as things go but as stated the gameplay etc needs tweaking.\nIt unfortunately is very much like other zombie games, and even though its a little more refined, coming from a bigger game company, I am sadly disappointed in what it offers.\nCOULD have been really, good, but ended up sub par.\nAgain IF it had been a FPS, you could overlook some of the other problems.\nI'd rate this a mediocre game.

It takes ideas from RE, SH, TLOU, Dead Space and Call of Duty (!), and compiles it in a way that will make the game repetitive and boring, and "deja vu".\n- the PC port is horrible, even played 2 months after release without black borders and a few bugs fixed.

Unless you're ok with it crashing to desktop every 30 min, you need at least 8GB of system RAM (even then, don't expect to play it more than 1:30 at a time).   The 4GB minimum spec that's listed on the box and on Steam gets thrown out the window as soon as you contact BethSoft's tech support.\n\nSecond, the video card?  It says 1GB is the minimum.  However, that is apparently the minimum spec for the first little bit of the game.   The first part of the intro is a rail sequence, where you're expected to hold down a key get things to move forward.   It may as well have been a cutscene, because that illusion of control is all the control you've got until just after you get inside.   After that, if your video card has less than 2GB, just mouse looking around will be a stop motion slide show.  BethSoft tech support will tell you outright that 2GB is the real minimum video requirement but you have to contact tech support to find that out.\n\nOn the plus side, now that I've upped everything to the minimum spec (not the one posted before you buy this piece of crap), I can now very smoothly look around .   That's about all I can do though, because the game no longer registers the keyboard at all.   Awaiting response from Bethsoft, and I fully expect them to tell me about some other deviation from the advertised minimum specs.\n\nThe game is apparently quite good on PS4 and XBox One though.  Don't waste your money on the PC version at regular price.  The bugs and the inaccurate official system reqs for this game make it only worthwhile if your system has double the memory and double the video card memory that's listed..   The game's a year old now, and Bethesda has not fixed all the bugs and WILL NOT patch it further.","November 8, 2015","false","2.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"

That just looks a little different. That the way this is ...compared to Resident Evil 4. But to tell you the truth. RE4 was a way, way better game then this. If I could say that RE4 was a good game. And to top all of that off. I never want to play this game. Once every week or two I force myself to give this game another shot. I keep saying to myself, theres got to be something good about this game. But there's not. The story & characters are boring as hell. You just feel like your going through the motions. In almost all games, even the bad ones. I can say something good about them. But not this one. Stay away from this one. It's not was they say it is. The trailer makes it look like the game is worth buying. Don't be fooled. Unless you a little kid. Thats the only way you might like this. And that why most reviews for this game are positive. They should put how old you are next to your review. But before I buy any game I read both sides of the coin. Well, that's my 2 cents","December 13, 2014","false","22.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

My two peronal favorite game publishers are Bethesda and Capcom (the old Capcom) and this is why I pre-ordered.\n\nUpgradeable Character - Skyrim alone is proof that players love to build up their character into an invincible force to go kick some tail.\n\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nAmmo - The serious lack of ammo (at least the first time round) is why I have only played this game 4 hours so far. There are many better ways to make a game challenging. This is probably the worst thing to do in any game. Players like to feel like they are kicking tail, how can they feel like that without any ammo?\n\nCheats - When I first learned that there were cheats I had renewed hope for plentiful ammo but I have not been able to get it this cheat to work no matter how much ammo I have on hand. Why not use the tried and true Skyrim console in the future?!\n\nThe Ugly:\n\nAspect Ratios and Resolutions - When I first played this game I really struggled with the aspect ratio. This is something that players should not have to worry about. Most PC gamers have at least 1080p, but many are pushing beyond that now. Games should be made to take advantage of video cards as much as possible. We spend hundreds of dollars on video cards for a reason. Many of us have a 144Hz monitor so limiting games to 30 and 60 is just stupid.","December 21, 2014","false","4.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/recommended/268050/","CPTMOISTPANTIES","Cpt. Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","260 products in account","Just a brief foreword: this is not a bad game, don't let the red thumb dissuade you from getting this game if it intrigues you.  It's merely a game I don't believe is worth playing, but that doesn't make it bad, that makes it passable and a non-priority. With that out of the way:\n\nThe Evil Within is a mish-mash of environments strung together with an empty plot that goes nowhere for half the game. You start out in a hospital, escape it to see the world ending, crash and wind up in Resident Evil 4, wake up and wind up in a castle, fall and get up in a factory, etc etc etc. It's constant changes of environments strung together by a plot that rationalizes it all by saying you are in someone's mind gathering memories from various people due to an experiment.\n\nIn the beginning it's played with fairly well, as the changes in environments seem to be fairly sensical and rationally follow through. But around chapter 4 or 5 they threw it all out the window and throw you onto a large cliff with a castle in the distance and your partner who's been missing for ages in the middle of a field. It's pretty sad, since initially it made me question what was ''real'' and what wasn't, but a little before the mid-way point it's painfully obvious that it's all just mental fu*kery, so there goes the intrigue. Not helping the scenario are the characters that don't seem to care that they keep teleporting from environment to environment. First thing they say when they wake up in a completely new area? ''We gotta get outta here''. Realistic. You would THINK maybe they might ASK what the hell is going on or how they wound up where they are; whether they have memories of previous environments or not. Nope. We gotta get outta here.\n\nThe environments themselves start out promising and aid the stealth gameplay. Initially you're in a wooded area that is fairly big and truly feels like an area you can get lost in. You sneak by villagers and get an RE4 feeling for the thing, except more stealth involved and large environments to sneak around in. But that's only 20% of the game; the larger environments are eventually thrown out for enclosed buildings, which is to the detriment of the stealth element. Most of the time the enemies see you first, or they're in corridors that you can't sneak by because it's an effin corridor. Or they're in a room with nowhere to hide anyway, so you can crouch and not be seen, but they'll be blocking the way so eff it you pull out your gun and shoot since there's no way to get closer for a stealth kill.\n\nEnvironments aside, the gunplay is...ehh. By default you can hold a total of 12 handgun bullets, and 8 or so shotgun rounds. That's VERY little, and I assume it was the case to add tension to ammunition management and to shy away from an action-oriented horror game. That's fine in the beginning, since you can realistically stealth through villages and set up silent kills. But later environments are strictly gunplay (or running away) and you'll be backtracking for ammunition you couldn't pick up earlier because you were full. Thankfully you can upgrade your carrying capacity, but it still costs a decent amount to acquire them, but by the time you have such upgrades you'll be around midway done with the game. Around that point the game is 'building tension', which means fewer enemies since it's harder to scare someone with a zombie when 200 of them are constantly on-screen. What that means is fewer enemies and a lot of creaking and background laughter. You'll ocassionally get assaulted by 4 or so zombies (or midbosses), but generally you'll have more ammo midway onwards due to ''tension''.\n\nAn issue with a specific weapon is the hanfgun, and it shows a general issue with combat in this title. RE4 had the handguns retain their usefulness by letting you stagger enemies, which would segueway into a cinematic melee attack that lasted 2 seconds and did good damage. This allowed you to conserve ammo; this game's version of the melee attack are matches. If an enemy falls to the floor you can quickly run up to them and light their body aflame for an immediate kill. The problem is that the handgun takes around 4 or 5 shots to stagger enemies and have them fall to their knees. And wasting a match on an enemy that only needs 2 or so more bullets to die is a waste. Headshots with the handgun are also useless, as you need to update it SIGNIFICANTLY to get a 50%+ chance of headshot kills finishing off enemies. In other words, the handgun is useless until you upgrade it significantly. The shotgun on the other hand almost immediately makes all enemies fall to the ground, but at the same time it two shots most people up close, so why use matches? It's a flawed system to the detriment of the handgun.\n\nAll in all it's still an alright game, but it's by no means RE4 or some horror game that will make you ♥♥♥♥ yourself. It's combat has a few flaws (I didn't even mention the sh*t accuracy in weapons when shooting from mid-range), but it generally plays well with no real issues. Honestly, the narrative just isn't there for me to care about any of this. There are documents and files in a few levels giving a bit of backstory to the main character, but who cares? The guy barely talks and all he says is, ''sh*t'' and ''fu*k''. Wow tell me more about this man he had a daughter wow she died wow he must have it hard. You would think that such a thing would affect him and at least creep up in his dialogue. Nope. But we gotta get outta here. It's like the plot and characters didn't matter, just the environments.","April 4","false","40.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

The start of the game was great and interesting; a lot of questions, a lot happening, great setting to dive you into it. Then it killed its own momentum as I had to sneak past clumsy zombies in fields for an hour, then through some connected wood shacks for a half hour. Some things are ok mechanically.  But so much of the gameplay is a very late rehashing of every horror/survival/rpg that came out in the last 10 years. Oh and the camera angles are awful. I felt like I was constantly fighting to see the world around me, my character blocking my view like someone stepping in front of my screen.\n\nThe graphics are honestly all that feels new in this game. At the time of typing I have only 3 hours of play time, so maybe it redeemed itself later. Maybe there are some good twists and turns in the plot. But I don't really feel like pushing to see if it might, it just feels like a pretty version of an outdated template.","May 18","false","3.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

There are some very basic rules that exist in modern gaming, and one of the most important is alleviating repetition. In a modern AAA title, I want immersion into a story that can play out in multitude of ways. The Evil Within accomplishes its challenge by means of clunky controls and awkward camera angles, and punishes failure by forcing the player to repeat these challenges ad naseum. Checkpoints are few and far between, with save points being very spread out. This leaves you spending a lot of time performing trial and error play, with failure forcing the player to repeat arduous, unenjoyable stages that don't alter the challenge, but rather maintain it through frustrating and awkward play. Its not that its hard, its that its awkward. There is no feeling of pride or accomplishment in overcoming difficult parts, only relief that its over. I am desperately trying to get my money out of the game,  but I grow ever closer to writing it off. The worst part is that it is not necessary; simple quicksave features and/or multiple paths to victory would have made this a truly worthwhile title and would alliviate the frustration over poor controls, bad framerate and technical shortcomings. This was rushed, and boy does it feel rushed. The play is so frustrating, repetitive and drawn out that the story is even difficult to follow.\n\nIf you are in the mood for survival horror, check out resident evil 4. If you are looking for a scare, check out outlast. Both are cheaper than the Evil Within, and both are absolutely leagues better. I honestly don't see anything this game does that another game doesn't do better. It could be considered average if they would have just spent a bit longer on improving the experience. Instead, it can only be described as bad.\n\nThis will be the first time I can say that I have been let down by Bethesda, so perhaps that adds to the sting. But I can honestly say that the title of this game is exceedingly apt.\n\nDon't buy this game.","December 5, 2014","false","5.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

However those who have played RE:4 will undoubtedly notice the vast similarities between the two, and this is where The Evil Within has it's downfall. From start to finish it's very clear that this game tries to emulate the same experience that RE:4 gave us back in 2004 and at some points, comes very close to doing so. The biggest issue (personally) for this game is that it can't really stick with any sort of theme and stick with it. One moment you're in a run-down town at night that feels dark and ominus then all of a sudden you're in the middle of a city where everything is literally falling apart around you. Variation is a good thing if done appropriately, this game does it in a much too abrupt style to the point where it's difficult trying to figure out what you're even playing. Does it fit in the horror genre? Does it fit into some Action adventure genre? I honestly can't tell, the game misleads you as to what it is straight from the beginning so that might be a good way to describe this game, misleading.","December 16, 2014","false","12.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It has become more and more commonplace that companies have pushed faulty games into the marketplace, However they still run on a majority of systems in the field. This system failed to run on three systems, two of which were off the shelf Dell's. This isn't to say that they ran poorly, I could accept that.

Its like the company was writing a story but is never going to telling the audience what the story is about. In addition to that, you constantly have to sneak around. Your character is so weak at the beginning of the game, if you try to fight any of the monsters you'll die near instantly, without any tool of defense. You are given a gun, with one clip of ammunition, which is 6 bullets, and is not nearly enough to kill a monster, even with every shot being a head shot. Like wise, you'll be lucky to find anymore ammunition and you'll be left with running for dear life. Not only to mention, that you can sprint for half the distance of a Call of Duty player (yea, I'm referencing call of duty, sue me) before your character is out of breath.\n\nMoving along, the default graphics setting is locked 30fps. Excuse me, this is PC, not console. I have two GTX 780's in SLI, I better be cranking settings as high as they can go, and running well beyond 60fps. So I changed it, and the only other option is locked 60fps is V-Sync, you cannot turn V-Sync off, hooray for input lag. Also, mouse acceleration is forced, with no option to turn off. You cannot play at a resolution higher than 1920x1080p, also, letterbox is basically forced, when I tried to turn it off, my FPS tanked to 5 from 60. Like wise, the overall graphics are not very good. Better than most games, but Tomb Raider looks better than this, and Tomb Raider came out before this game.

This not something I would have expected from an "experienced" game studio, and Bathesda obviously did not play the game or even look at it, and as them being a publisher for this, I definitely would not have expected seeing all these over sites from them.\n\nIn conclusion, I would easily rate this game a 2/10, this game feels like it is still in alpha.

I am a fan of horror games, in particular the Silent Hill style that is written all over Evil Within, but let me be brief and list the shortcomings that didn't make this game work for me.\n1) The engine: the controls and precision of strikes/shooting in fights is a real shame. Given that it is a checkpoint game where you have to replay extended stretches of it if you get killed, it is extremely annoying when I get killed regularly because of the controls. In the fights, there is no sense in the way the protagonist acts. He can't use the knife that he carries in melee, only in stealth. He finds himself with his back to an enemy _all the time_ after punching or shooting. The camera angle in the fights doesn't make any sense either, with the enemies frequently ending up in your blind zone when they come close. And yep, you can stuff an enemy with bullets, then lose sight of him, and next moment he stubs you to death with one swift motion or cuts you in pieces. The whole fight dynamics were not making any sense to me. And like I said, when applied to boss fights, I had enough of playing for 5-10 minutes after a checkpoint to collect a weapon or ammo, get to the boss, do precisely what I need to do (say, shoot a bolt), see the camera losing the angle, furiously rotate the protagonist to get hold of the boss, get cut into pieces in the next second, replay 5-10 minutes after the checkpoint, rinse and repeat. Senseless.\n2) The story, with all the pretense of the Silent Hill genre, does not grip.\n3) I haven't experienced any game killing bugs, but had a few minor ones that just puzzled me. Like, I would start the game, load a checkpoint, and suddenly all game controls are empty. I can't move. Luckily, it's very easy to reset the controls to default, but the question is, what the hell has just happened? Why does it happen? Or take the intentional gameplay controls that are not intuitive and have to be googled up (such as, you press space to "examine" and can't find how to turn it off until you google up that you need to press "c"). Like, what has just happened? Why is it designed this way?\nIt's merely an ok pastime game if you got it on a major discount. I would be frustrated if I bought in presale and/or at the full price. The trailer was cinematic, that was all to it.","January 8, 2015","false","3.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","1"

Truer words were never spoken my friends.\n\nThe Evil Within is unfun, unfair, and a terrible experience all around. Also, it doesn't have an original bone in its entire body.\n\nThis is what you get when you liberally take elements from Silent Hill, Resident Evil, Clocktower, Outlast, The Last of Us, The Grudge, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, SAW, and Inception and you mix them together with very little regard for what actually made those things GOOD, into a chaotic, disconnected, amorphous ‘plot’ that makes no damn sense until the very end of the game.\n\nIf the intention was to make me want to play and watch other things, well, you succeeded. Most of the source material this game draws from is FAR better.\n\nThe bottom line is that TEW doesn’t really know what it is and this lack of coherent gameplay direction or even a coherent narrative makes the resulting game a big goopy mess. It wants to be survival horror, but it’s too action oriented for that. It wants to be a good action game, but it randomly throws you against invincible enemies that can instantly kill you with no warning that you must run from.\n\nIt wants to be scary, but it just isn’t.\n\nHeed my warnings folks.

Only because I payed some freaking money for it I wanted to see the end of it, no matter what. And - admittedly - the gory and brutal gameplay can indeed keep the fun above the bare minimum needed for an action horror title to keep me going. Unfortunately, that's about it when it comes to the positive aspects of the game. The negative outweigh the positive by far.\n\nTake the story, for example. To be honest, I didn't even understand what the game was trying to tell me. There simply is no real story, it's a strange mix of involuntary brain surgery and drug induced nightmare fantasy hotchpotch ... thingy. And it is the inconceivably thin layer of background for the strange creatures (and your two companions) and their even stranger actions that is supposed to keep you motivated for about 14 hours - I call an epic fail, Mr. Mikami.\n\nSecondly, the game mechanic for character and weapon development is total crap - you collect puddles or jars of green gel to buy weapon and character upgrades. Because that's the way the world beyond our consciousness works, we turn snot to ammo pouches...?! WTF?! What is wrong with dead enemies dropping some good old coins, for heavens sake?\n\nNext annoying "feature" are the doors (yes, I am serious, the doors). Especially the ones in the "safe harbor dream world" (a small floor in some kind of hospital with a nurse mumbling strange stuff where you trade in your snot for upgrades). You return to this world in between levels and can move around between several rooms, each having a door you need to open. Each time you enter this safe heaven and walk into one of these rooms, you have to watch the slow door opening animations again. There is a Resident-Evil-4-style quick door opening mechanic, but you can only use it on doors you have already openend once. It sounds like a stupid thing to mention but it just gets on my nerves, big time. It sucks so much that I need to include it in this review - think about that!\n\nAlmost as a side note comes the fact that about half of the cutscenes are not skippable. Which really sucks when you reach a tough area and have to watch it over and over again.\n\nOn the technical side there are also more downs than ups. The game runs on the Id Tech 5 engine, inheriting the supertexture lazy loading effect where you turn quickly and see the objects get texturized with a little delay. It's very unfortunate that this engine seem to be uncontrollable since it offers great flexibility in level design and texture detail. And this is one of the pros of The Evil Within: you won't find any repetitive texture patterns, every level and every room comes with a very distinctive design.\n\nThe one big fun savior of the game is the fighting, which I think is really good. It is fluent and brutal and exciting. The weapon and hit sounds are pretty good and the guns have a nice splattering effect on most of the enemies (always aim for the head). The enemies are mostly humanoid zombies with some kind of a extreme piercing fetish where they have huge nails stuck in their heads. The bosses are even more disfigured: you fight a king size dog having his throat turned into a shark yap as well as a grown-up version of F.E.A.R.'s Alma, crawling on all fours with an extra pair of large arms. Overall, the monster design is pretty creative and it is kind of funny to see how the different types of creatures react to your weapons.\n\nSo, why and how did I cheat? I used god mode just to get on with the crappy story and to skip some of the areas that were simply annoying, just because I wanted to see where the trash plot was going and what the rest of the levels have to offer. The fights are fun, turning the monster's intestines inside out is just cool - even cool enough to lure me into a second round in New Game Plus mode, where you get to keep all weapons and character attributes. I simply farmed that stupid green gel, upgraded everything to the maximum and played on easy difficulty, just to run around in my character's head as the superior bad-♥♥♥ cop he probably thinks he is.","October 16, 2015","false","24.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/recommended/268050/","jackxblack","JackxBlack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jackxblack/","149 products in account","TL;DR - an action horror game that fails to be both action and horror but somehow kept me playing, 5/10.\n\nIt's a shame. This game is one of those that "have potential", however it wastes it all. Let's start with what this game is supposed to be (quote from game's site) "a game embodying the meaning of pure survival horror." or even (Wikipedia) "psychological survival horror" turns out to be a poor action game with lots of gore in it.\n\nThe "psychological" part, I think, indicates that nothing makes sense (which is sadly often the case). The story is extremely dumb and unclear throughout the whole game it's actually amazing. There was no point where I finally understood what the hell is actually going on. The way it is presented, the way the characters moves from one location to another, the completely redundant and unrelated notes, journals and audio tapes create one big confusing mess. Characters that are in the game are all stright out of "Most cliche characters in Japanese medias", without even slight changes made. Their lines are written so poorly (or the localization to the western market was so poor) they made me cringe every 10 minutes. They have no depth, no backstory (main character's past is presented with journals we found at specific rooms, but it it absolutely unrelated from the game and also fits to the cliche model of this character), they do not grow, change, show emotion. Nothing.\n\nThe other part, "horror", should be replaced with just "gore". There is nothing really scary in this game, only ugly and brutal monsters. The atmosphere is lacking, the main villan looks like he'd be down from 1 hit, multiple events that could be potentially scary are so grotesque they are instead funny. All this increases as the game goes on and it changes from a reather stealthy one to a full-out action game, that's made poorly. It tried to keep it's "survival" part by giving little ammo (Btw I just hate how games call themselves survival just because there's little ammo and there's absolutely no other survival part) which only made it frustrating, when as it goes on the amount of opponents becomes riddiculus.\n\nOn the technical side it's no better. Even though some of the locations looked good as long as you didn't come too close, and some models were done very well (safe head!) there was a tone of blurry textures and low poly models. Despite that the games runs terribly. On a 980Ti, with framerate "unlocked" (which also forces vsync on!) I had 30-40 FPS with CONSTANT stuttering. It looked a bit better with a 30 FPS lock, but it still often dropped to 28, causing small stutters. For a game looking like this this is not acceptable. Additionally, turning black bars and grain postprocess by the fault to make it more "cinematic" just shows how ignorant the people behind the PC versions were, or how little money was put into the port. Another, one big technical issue is the camera, constantly jumping, twitching, stuttering, blocking on meshes, getting inside of meshes etc. Also there was a lot of other, smaller bugs, like goats bigger than men, collision-less meshes, LODs cutting off text on signs.. Really sloppy work.\n\nHowever, despite all of that I kept going, hoping it will all make sense in the end. Even though it didn't, and even despite the absurd final boss fight I didn't really feel like I've wasted that 15h. I had a lot of frustration and even more disappointment which is why I do not recommend this game, but still I also had some fun.","February 18","false","15.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I tried and after around 7 hours and 6 chapters, I just can't play it anymore.  It feels clunkier than the early resident evil games.  Combat was horrible, boss battles seemed boring, and even the save system was a little bit of a pain.  I even left it alone for a while and tried to come back to it to see if it would grasp me.  Nadda.  It's really too bad as it had some fantastic reviews.  The missions all felt somewhat the same and linear.  The story was weak and I felt lost.  I had no connection with the characters.  It just failed on so many levels.  The graphics were nice, but no matter what AA settings you take the shadows would be jagged and look awful.  I’m sad that this will be a title I will never finish a play through on as I have played through some pretty horrible games just to say I have solved them.

If you loved Resident Evil 4 You will like this game. Its a mixture of RE 4 and a little of the Last of Us. Story is average but the gameplay is fun. You have limited amount of resources however once u learn to group enemies and shot them once with a shotgun and then use ur matches properly, should allow you to easily kill 2 to 3 enemies at a time even more if u time the shot well(only using 1 shotgun shell in the process). Also mid game and later on many state you cannot stealth kill enemies which is kinda true however flash arrows are great for blinding groups of enemies allowing you to stealth kill them all. Tip/hint avoid upgrading the melee skill upgrade cause it useless. You should first upgrade you sprint and then follow by syringes and last ur health. Upgrade  ur crossbow and save ur freeze and explosive arrows for mid/bosses. Note: if ur hurt upgrading ur health upgrade will replenish ur health bar. Last tip some bosses cannot be kill when u first meet them similar to the "IT" boss fight in RE4 where you must avoid the boss and run. Then the next time you meet that boss you can damage them and kill them. Since you have limited resources and no map the game encourage u to explore the level for supplies(look for small statues and break them for extra keys which u can use for extra supplies in the save room. Last but not least, the game plays much better with a xbox 360 gamepad. mouse and keyboard is not that great.","December 2, 2014","true","41.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The story is shrouded in mystery and it will be slowly unraveled throughout your playthrough, but it won't explain anything outright. This may be frustrating, but I challenged myself to embrace not only the challenge of the game, but also the challenge of figuring out what the heck is going on; it is fun to devise your own theories.\n\nThe gameplay shines because you have many options with which to approach a situation. Oftentimes you can forgo battle altogether, but I found stealth-killing the most satisfying. One of the game's biggest strength is in its level-variety and gameplay-variety. The designers put you in a variety of gameplay-scenarios so that you don't feel like you're doing the same thing over and over again, and the same applies to the levels.\n\nAt first, I was not really into the game; it didn't make sense, and it was more weird and gross, rather than scary. After reaching a point where more freedom was given however, I started to like the game. I began learning how its mechanics worked, and dying over and over again would only encourage me to try different things and be more explorative. Soon I would come back for more regularly. There was something enthralling about how all its parts worked together, from the haunting save-mirror song Claire De Lune, its finely polished gameplay, to its mysterious and curious plot.","November 8, 2014","true","39.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Instant kill bosses, varied and hard enemy fodder and limited ammunition. These aren't the slow-poke enemies like before, so to help, the game gives you the ability to sneak, distract and assasinate (up close, with some enemies only).\n\nThe issue with the game is technical, for PC standards. First the splash video crashes the game which you can fix with launch options and the fps is limited to 30.\n\nThe PC master race does not approve of a fps cap (after all, we spent a boat load on our pcs to avoid that crap cap!).\n\nMost of these can fixed with these launch options:\n\n+com_skipIntroVideo 1 +r_swapinterval -1\n\nBut then you run into heavy optimization issues with stuttering etc... but I don't believe that should deter you from the game.

The letterbox resolution is annoying at first, but after getting use to it, it wasn't an issue, you can enable the debug console for this game within the properties of this game on steam BUT it will disable achievement triggers (even if you only change the FPS lock or Resolution). Fortunately, when you disable the debug console and load your saved game, all achievement will trigger at once (the ones that you've met the requirements for obviously), while on the topic of the debug console, you can remove the letterbox, but I recommend not to, since it pretty much just zooms in more onto the character and the Field of View is horrendous like that (plus it gives motion sickness).\n\nFor the actual gameplay, It felt like I was playing Resident Evil 4 (somewhat) and a little mix of The Last of Us (again...somewhat), stealth is introduce early in the game...but is not mandatory, since the only time I actually used it, was when they introduced it to me. Everywhere else in the game, ennemies already know you're there, or are never turned away from you (even if they are, by the time you crouch walk to them, which is extremely slow, they will just turn around). So in general, stealth was really pointless. Combat was fine, you have firearms and melee (which sucks ♥♥♥). If you ever get stuck with just your fist, good luck or GG. even when fully upgraded, punching does almost close to no damage, it will take a little while for you to punch them to the ground and burn them with a match (will talk about that later). You do come across some melee weapons, (mostly Torches or Wood axes) and they are most of the time one shot kills, but they are not that common. You can find Matches (up to 5, when not upgraded) and you can burn downed ennemies (or even ennemies that "seems" to be dead, some are though) matches are extremely helpfu last some points of the game, you can down multiple ennemies and burn them while they are helpless on the ground, if they are close together, they can all burn within one match and that way, you can conserve ammo. Ammo is debatably scarce, as in, you may find a lot of ammo, which is too much for the scenario, or not enough. (especially during the last chapters, but I do admit, I did screw up and miss a lot). There is also traps located everywhere in the game, you can either disarm them (and collect material to craft agony bolts for your agony crossbow) or use them to your own advantage and strategize to kill the ennemies. My opinion on this, is don't even bother on using them against the ennemy. Some are weirdly placed and don't help you at all, Just scavenge 'em and make them bloody bolts! Healing is pretty easy, just find syringes and stab yourself, their is also medkits, which fully heals you, but will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you invulrenable for many seconds (around 10). They are rare to find, and use them when you're out of battle. And last but not least, the upgrade system. The upgrade system is a electrical chair, that shocks your brain everytime you upgrade stuff (like health, melee, guns, bolts, and other stuff). To upgrade stuff, you need to first, find a mirror (not any kind of mirror, you will come across specific doors with a red symbol on it, and also music, and from that point on, you can travel through a mirror where you can save, upgrade, open safes that you can open with keys that you find through out the game by smashing tiny statues and etc.) then sit onto the chair, and spend your Green Gel (which is like currency kind of), I call it Brain Juice. You can't fully upgrade on the first playthrough, I'm assuming you can in New Game+.\n\nI won't go to much in the story, the story was okay, a bit confusing, since the game just throws you everywhere (fall into a pit, end up elsewhere.

Unlock the frame rate (if your PC up to it) but it still has issues. I’m not defending this as the game looks amazing in 60fps… however it’s not optimized for it.\nSecond, the requirements are higher than needed. I have a decent system (i-7 4770 OC’ed 4.5ghz, ASUS GTX 780 OC’ed, 16GB 2133 RAM (corsair Vengeance), ASUS Maximus formula board corsair 860i PSU and 3 Samsung 840 PROs in RAID5) now let’s face facts quality of components does play a part. I’m playing in 30fps at 1440 on my 50 inch TV (that’s why I’m not ganna complain about the bars, however on a smaller monitor id be a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as well.\nOk, ok… the game. Well it’s awesome… ever chapter is challenging in its own right, and they each have their own theme. The game make you feel helpless at time 9just what you want from survival horror). The menu upgrade system weapons all fit and feel good.\nThe graphics- Well it could be better definitely needs some better AA. The textures are good sometimes and bad in other, but overall not bad. The lighting is defiantly beautiful.\nThe game play is fun and adds just enough handicap to make you crap when your low on ammo and walk into a room with 3 damned waiting for you. The bosses are just simply bad ♥♥♥ and tricky.\nThe overall theme… I am truly pumped, while the game doesn’t add any ground breaking features it does pull all the elements together for a truly fun experience.\nThe story, while I haven’t beat the game (currently on chapter 10), there is a good story here you just need to read into it. Look for all the audio logs and read all documents pay attention to the cut scenes and the character you run into, I so far love the angle the game is taking. I have heard the ending is disappointing, however this maybe from people not paying attention to all the clues leading up (just an opinion as I feel the story is good thus far).\nCan’t wait to beat the game and play again aiming for the 5hr play though. I use to love and play resident evil 1 back in the day, but the series has taken a turn for the worse (5+) but now the evil within is filling the shoes. Loving it!\nThe game has thrills, chills, action, story, motivation, puzzles, mystery, bad ♥♥♥ boss battles, and is one hell of a mind trip.\nIf I scored before finishing the game it is easy 8.5 out of 10.\nPick it up, make sure you play though chapter 3 to get a good feel of diversely.\n","October 18, 2014","true","33.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The letterbox resolution is annoying at first, but after getting use to it, it wasn't an issue, you can enable the debug console for this game within the properties of this game on steam BUT it will disable achievement triggers (even if you only change the FPS lock or Resolution). Fortunately, when you disable the debug console and load your saved game, all achievement will trigger at once (the ones that you've met the requirements for obviously), while on the topic of the debug console, you can remove the letterbox, but I recommend not to, since it pretty much just zooms in more onto the character and the Field of View is horrendous like that (plus it gives motion sickness).\n\nFor the actual gameplay, It felt like I was playing Resident Evil 4 (somewhat) and a little mix of The Last of Us (again...somewhat), stealth is introduce early in the game...but is not mandatory, since the only time I actually used it, was when they introduced it to me. Everywhere else in the game, ennemies already know you're there, or are never turned away from you (even if they are, by the time you crouch walk to them, which is extremely slow, they will just turn around). So in general, stealth was really pointless. Combat was fine, you have firearms and melee (which sucks ♥♥♥). If you ever get stuck with just your fist, good luck or GG. even when fully upgraded, punching does almost close to no damage, it will take a little while for you to punch them to the ground and burn them with a match (will talk about that later). You do come across some melee weapons, (mostly Torches or Wood axes) and they are most of the time one shot kills, but they are not that common. You can find Matches (up to 5, when not upgraded) and you can burn downed ennemies (or even ennemies that "seems" to be dead, some are though) matches are extremely helpfu last some points of the game, you can down multiple ennemies and burn them while they are helpless on the ground, if they are close together, they can all burn within one match and that way, you can conserve ammo. Ammo is debatably scarce, as in, you may find a lot of ammo, which is too much for the scenario, or not enough. (especially during the last chapters, but I do admit, I did screw up and miss a lot). There is also traps located everywhere in the game, you can either disarm them (and collect material to craft agony bolts for your agony crossbow) or use them to your own advantage and strategize to kill the ennemies. My opinion on this, is don't even bother on using them against the ennemy. Some are weirdly placed and don't help you at all, Just scavenge 'em and make them bloody bolts! Healing is pretty easy, just find syringes and stab yourself, their is also medkits, which fully heals you, but will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you invulrenable for many seconds (around 10). They are rare to find, and use them when you're out of battle. And last but not least, the upgrade system. The upgrade system is a electrical chair, that shocks your brain everytime you upgrade stuff (like health, melee, guns, bolts, and other stuff). To upgrade stuff, you need to first, find a mirror (not any kind of mirror, you will come across specific doors with a red symbol on it, and also music, and from that point on, you can travel through a mirror where you can save, upgrade, open safes that you can open with keys that you find through out the game by smashing tiny statues and etc.) then sit onto the chair, and spend your Green Gel (which is like currency kind of), I call it Brain Juice. You can't fully upgrade on the first playthrough, I'm assuming you can in New Game+.\n\nI won't go to much in the story, the story was okay, a bit confusing, since the game just throws you everywhere (fall into a pit, end up elsewhere. Walk through a corridor, get grabbed by something coming out the floor, going through the floor and ended up in a weird place like the sewers, or outside somewhere.\n\nThe controls are pretty good too, for the first 10 hours I've played with a controller, then I switched to Keyboard/mouse (since I forgot to plugin my controller and was too lazy to restart the game, so I decided to give it a try) and the game was actually 5 times easier, the aiming works very well, and the movement is quite responsive, but navigating the menus is horrendous, it feels like Vsync is on and that's the main reason I didn't try the Keyboard/Mouse at first. I did encounter FPS issues, it seemed to have fixed when I switched which monitor is was being played on, When loading the game, I always need to alt-tab a couple of times, because the games seems to have crashed all the time, but with a little patient, all is fine.\n\nAnd finally, the most important thing....Is it scary?\nNo, not even close, this game did not phase me one bit, after the whole 12 hours of playing this game, there wasn't one moment where I felt scared or creeped out or even powerless.

I was honestly on edge for most of the game, which is something that I haven't really experienced in a long time. Not only are the enemies uniquely grotesque and genuinely scary (especially when they surprise you) but the dark environments truly set the mood and add an extra layer of dread and suspense. The lighting, in particular, was amazing in my opinion. Not only that, but the sound effects were also incredibly well made; making me cringe everytime I heard the ghastly noises from enemies nearby, always hoping that they had not seen or heard me moving about.\n\nThe story itself was fascinating to me. The simple fact that the game takes place in the mind of a psycopath and that you have to fight through his evil subconscious to escape made this game compelling enough for me in and of itself. The added details (such as the major characters and backstories) made everything that much better. Sadly most of the characters in the game aren't developed enough, especially when it comes to main character Sebastian. Though we do get a better sense of him through collectibles, his in-game personality doesn't reflect his backstory well enough. He's pretty boring in person, to be honest. That being said, I still ended up appreciating each of the characters and their personalities even though they weren't as fleshed out as I would have liked. They inevitably made the story more interesting and compelling.\n\nOne other component that I liked about the game's narrative is the mystery surrounding it. The game never tells you the complete story. It tells you the main details but then gives you small pieces of information via collectibles and audio logs to make sense of the particulars. This was something that I truly enjoyed since it allowed me to make connections between all the pieces of information the game made available to me in order to figure out what was going on in the background. I was already invested in the story as it is, but this facet of the game incentivized me to dive into it even more.\n\nOverall I would say that this was an awesome gaming experience. The Evil Within is definitely near the top of my list of greatest games to come out in 2014, and I'm definitely looking forward to play the DLC chapters. GET THIS GAME!!!\n","October 30, 2014","true","55.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Also, it generally does a better job of tying in scares with level design and gameplay mechanics, not to mention that 'scares' alone are highly subjective and rarely a factor in replayability (i.e. you might as well just watch a movie if all you want is to see/hear really creepy stuff).\n\nSpeaking of subjective factors, I liked the story - even its main protagonist. Yes, there are cheesy moments here and there, but overall it does a good job of ♥♥♥♥ing with your mind and keeping you guessing. And perhaps more importantly, everything is presented in a very polished and atmospheric setting, with plenty of morbid details to keep you immersed and uneasy.\n\nIt is ultimately a linear experience, but exploration is rewarded with both items and story bits. And as I've already hinted at, this game offers multiple, organic approaches to solving each encounter and is therefore highly replayable, especially in new game+ mode. I rarely felt like there were a fixed number of  options, pre-determined  by the developers. It always felt more like a creative survival effort - tense and satisfying.\n\nI don't remember the last time a horror game kept me hooked for more than 7 hours straight, and I have played quite a few of them: the amnesia games, among the sleep, silent hill, resident evil, etc.\n\nOf course, there are some issues with the game:\n-too expensive in my opinion\n-poorly optimized (especially considering the price they are charging on PC - thankfully most of the issues can be fixed)\n-low fov\n-giant black bars\n-'cinematic' camera angles can mess up your gameplay occasionally\n-a few crappy encounters with gun-wielding zombies... seriously don't ever do that again\n","November 2, 2014","true","22.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I am a proud member of the PC Master Race, running dual 7970's in x-fire; I love my high end PC gaming.  Resident Evil 4 is also my favorite game of all time.  On with the review..\n\nChapter 1:  PC Optimization?\n\nThe Dev created Evil Within with this wonky FOV and in letterbox supposedly as a design choice.  Well it was the wrong one.  The FOV makes it more difficult than it should be to play.  Regarding the 30 FPS lock, while this is terrible to do to us PC Elite's, for this type of game its no big deal.  that said, you can change this via console commands, and hopefully Bathesda will patch and fix it properly.  I had to disable X-fire on my rig to get this to run, again, sucks, but no big deal.  It's a console game for Christ's sake and runs like as dream on one of my 7970's.  So my thoughts on the PC Port are:  It runs like it would if you had it for the PS4, and that's ok.  At least we have access to the game at all on PC.\n\nChapter 2:  The game itself\n\nI think the game is great.  If you slapped Leon in the main role and replaced the enemies with the Ganado's from RE4 this could be called RE 4.5.  The game play, aside from the horrible FOV is the same as RE4, and I think that's awesome.  Im having a great time with it and cant wait to play it again.  At the end of the day that's all we can ask for with a new game, Right?  If you have any interest in the game, or the survival horror genre in general.

The game is often times a great challenge without ever being BS or artificially difficult. The levels are seperated by chapter, and are very linear with minimal backtracking. Many boss fights are meant to be escaped instead of fought. Weapons are satisfying and enemies react very noticeably to being attacked, making gunplay feel heavy and strong (provided you have ammo to burn at all.)\n\nThe first quarter of the game felt really easy but after that the game starts sending increasingly large waves of enemies per chapter, putting a heavy focus on combat and managing resources. I nearly ran out of ammo completely a few times but was always able to make using traps or disposable melee weapons. Also most guns have the capability of killing most enemies in a single critical shot if you feel lucky.\n\nAlso a few things the games did right that could have been annoying but wasn't.\n-AI partners: they are for brief sections and can easily handle themselves, and can be healed for free. They are surprisingly usefull, while in most games AI partners are a drag to bring with you.\n-Puzzles: They are all short-medium length and require just the right amount of thought. No reading books to find where a secret pressure plate is or anything like that.\n-Length: The game took me 18 hours to beat on my first playthough on survival and I apparently found only about 60% of the collectibles. The game is very replayable and offers rewards for doing side content like hard mode and collectibles.\n\nI played with an Xbox One controller at the default 30fps and the game felt great to me. The optimizations is pretty off, I have a GTX970 and wasn't able to keep a steady 60fps when I switched the cap off, although I can play Rage and Wolfenstein maxed with better performance. I have never experienced any crashes or game breaking glitches.\nI was at first saying I was glad I didn't pre-order, but buying the game I feel like I would have been happy if I did, it's a great game despite the lack of true PC care.","October 21, 2014","true","56.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

By the time I reached the final boss battle I was happy that it was basically an arcade shooter (complete with big red targets to show you where the boss' weak point is) so I didn't have to exert any more effort on this title.\n\n6/10 - I wanted to like it so much but after the first few chapters things start going downhill.","January 13, 2015","false","18.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","2"
