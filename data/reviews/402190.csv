It feels like I'm really uninstalling a crap Unity game made of 2 lazily slapped together "minigames" and getting a refund for it.\n\nOh wait no, I'm doing that in real life.","September 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 289 of 315 people (92%) found this review helpful 148 people found this review funny","92","289","315","148","2"

It's okay I guess for 0.49 but,I wouldn't recommend it,I got bored after playing the exact same games over at least 3 times.\n\nFor 4.99 this isn't worth it at full price. If you're able to get more entertainment out of this than I did,well good for you then.\nThough I seriously can not recommend this especially with it saying this is 0.01 Alpha. Shouldn't this be listed as early access as well? Well anyways,yeah it gets boring quite fast.\n\nIf you don't think my review is fair,then let me sum up the game. You play a game,you collect food,water,from the game in order to survive and to not die and if you become too bored as well,you die of boredom. You get a key for beating game,just to move on to the next room which seems to be a remake of the exact same games.\n\nIn all seriousness if you could die of boredom,this game possibly would have killed me.","April 28","false","0.5"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

Мы встроили тебе игру в игру, чтобы ты мог играть в игре.\nТеперь о механике.\nВы играете за человека, предположительно за куна. Ваша задача - играть в игры. Просто звучит, да? Как бы не так... Управление не отзывчивое, складывается чувство, что у главного героя игра идет в 20 кадрах. Сложность выше среднего. Прямой конкурент всем дарк соулсам. Чтобы не умереть надо подбирать еду и питье, до которых иногда хрен доберешься, и которые могут кончиться в любой момент.\n10/10 игра года.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSat down to play - died of thirst / hunger.\nNow mechanics.\nYou play as a man, presumably a guy. Your task - to play games. Sounds nice, right? As though not so ... Control is not responsive, formed a feeling that the protagonist of the play in 20 frames per second. The difficulty is above average. Direct competitor all Dark Souls games. In order not to die should be selected food and drink, which is sometimes difficult to get to, and that can end at any time.\n10/10 goty","September 22, 2015","true","0.8"," 53 of 644 people (8%) found this review helpful 89 people found this review funny","8","53","644","89","29"
