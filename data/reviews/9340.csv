Opposing Fronts is a standalone expansion for Company of Heroes. It adds 2 new armies (The British and the Panzer Elite) for multiplayer/AI matches, two new campaigns for both factions, unique new doctrines and tons of new units with loads of abilities.\n-Armies/Units\nThe British are a good solid defensive faction. Most of their power comes from emplacements you build.\nPros- Command Trucks are used for HQs, meaning you can place them in any of your secured territories, boosting its resource output. Heavy defensive positions like Slit Trenches, MG Positions, AT gun emplacements and Mortar emplacements can be built for a small amount of resources and population. Infantry can be upgraded with many different weapons, increasing their efficency against other infantry, light vehicles or heavy tanks. Their doctrines offer Commando Support which allows you to land a glider with 6 Commandos, a glider with a light tank that is effective against halftracks, infantry and other light tanks, and a HQ glider which allows the production of AT commandos, Mortar Commandos and HMG commandos.\nCons- They are purely defensive (unless you use the Commando Doctrine) and do not have much offensive capabilty. Their infantry walks very slowly through enemy or uncaptured territory to gain more defensive against attacks (which is annoying at the start). Their tanks (aside from the Sherman Firefly) all have small guns but heavy armor that can't do ♥♥♥♥ against many medium to heavy tanks.\n-The Panzer Elite are a very mobile faction. Most of their amor is made up of halftracks (which can be pretty powerful) but they can get some good heavy tanks and tank destroyers.\nPros- Great faction for quick and powerful attacks. Infantry halftracks let the garrisoned squad shoot out the top with any weapons they have (bazzokas, mgs or snipers). The Marder tank destroyer is extremely good with an ability to "lock-down" making it immoblie but a faster rate of fire that does more damage. Almost all of their infantry can repair stuff.\nCons- As said before, their armor are halftracks.\n-Overall Score: 8.5/10\nA good game but better as an expansion to CoH 1.","August 2, 2014","true","51.3"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","33","36","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/recommended/9340/","brendissimo","Brendissimo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brendissimo/","277 products in account","Originally posted on November 24, 2007\n\nCompany of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is an expansion pack, but it is sold as a stand alone game, much like the recent Supreme Commander expansion. It provides two new campaigns, covering the Liberation of Caen as the British, and Operation Market Garden as the Panzer Elite. the inclusion of the Panzer Elite is an interesting touch, as few games to date have German campaigns. The campaigns have solid stories, and good replay values through different difficulty levels and medals. However, the game is not really about the campaigns; It is about the new factions, the Brits and the PE. They drastically change the balance of multiplayer, and needless to say, there are still some significant balance issues to work out.\nAll in all though, the new factions are great.\n\nBritish-The British are all about defense. They have the capability to build some amazing defensive emplacements very early on, so watch out for that. Their infantry is very solid, but their armor is weak and expensive.\n\nThe Panzer Elite- The PE, contrary to their name, are not about panzers, but rather are about fast attacks with mechanized and motorized units. They have a wide variety of halftracks and armored cars, including mortar halftracks and AT halftracks. Perhaps their greatest weapon is their tank destroyer, the Marder II, which is one of the best in the game.\n\nOn an overall level, Opposing Fronts delivers, but if you are new to the franchise, try the original first.","March 1, 2014","true","0.1"," 25 of 26 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","25","26","0","2"

See Conclusion\nINTRODUCTION:Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts is a real-time strategy game developed by Relic Entertainment and published by THQ (RIP). This game serves as the first official expansion pack to the series which adds two new factions, new units, a German (Panzer Elite) and British campaigns along with new multiplayer maps.\n\nThe expansion pack 'Opposing Fronts' added 2 new campaigns for the new factions of Great Britain who's plot revolves around the British Royal Army's operation to retake and secure the city of Caen in northern France. On the other-hand, the new Axis campaign featured the Panzer Elite faction in their mission to foil an Allied Operation called 'Market Garden'.\n\nPROS:+ Improved special effects\n+ New Factions\n+ German and British Campaigns\n+ New Units are fun to play with\n+ Standalone Expansion but...(See CON #3)\n+ Allows players with the expansion to play with players without the expansions and vice versa\n\nCONS:- Balance issues\n- AI is somehow worse than the original\n- Does not include the original armies unless you have the original game\n- Campaign has some dull moments\n- Inconsistent sound / voice levels for some of the units\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION but could have used a little more polish. Opposing Fronts is a great expansion that adds a lot of replayability to the original game by adding new factions; new units; new Campaign and a ton of improvements that increases the authentic feel and immersion of the game.\n\nMUST BUY for RTS and World War 2 fans whether at full price or on sale. Although, I highly advice the 'Complete Pack' (which includes the original game and the 2 expansions) to have the full experience.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

Relic have nailed the idea of making the whole genre more actiony. They did it with Warhammer but that stuck more to a particular audience and the slight cartoonish graphics put many off. Now in company of heroes it has polished graphics and a subject to suit a wider audience. WW2 although seems quite an over used subject for gaming, has never been as explored as this in an RTS form. The reason for giving it an 8 is because the new expansion was a marketing scheme all along. If you want to survive in multiplayer you must get this game otherwise your whermacht will be screwed by British artillery that can fire at your base from the other end of the map.

What I've of played of this game is incredible. You care about your troops even though you can make new ones just like Dawn of war. There's plenty of additional defense strucutures to build like Barbed Wire, Tank Traps, Mines, Sand bags and turrets, all of these reuslt in the perfect defense if placed correctly. You can choose whether to play as Axis or Allies, in my opinion the Axis are more fun to play as but for the Allies it's cool to drop troops from Air control onto the battlefieild using battlefield perks - They are basically specific types of troop reinforcement to use such as: Plane and air control, Artillery, etc I recently came across a problem whilst playing the game, It was entirely not the games fault, I'll leave it in the bottom of my review so that it explains the comments.\n\n\n\nI am new to coh. So I downloaded the Demo a few weeks ago and being a fan of Dawn Of War and WW2 immediately loved what I saw. So I decided to purchase the full game in eager anticipation.I had purchased the New Steam Version and Southern* Fronts DLC. After installing I launched it and couldn't play half the game because It said "You require the original Company Of Heroes gme to play this." Even though I had JUST downloaded it. I went ahead and waited for the DLC to install and loaded that up. Exactly the same problem. I then got annoyed and wanted to play the damn game, so I set up a Skirmish match. the building models and soldier models were gone, only their shadows remained. I looked up a soultion for the problem and someone mentioned changing the grapchical options so I did... It caused the game to go to a black screen and immediately crash. Not happy at all.","October 27, 2014","true","0.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","7"

Also having this series on steam means it will auto patch to the proper version.   This series have been patched and balanced mutiple times and having to patch manualy is a pain.  Having this on steam is a very big bonus.\n\nThe Company of Heroes and Opposing Fronts has a long single player campain.  Also Opposing Fronts adds the British and German Panzer Elite forces.\nTales of Valor only has a very short campain.

A very standard expansion. It does everything that an expansion is supposed to do, faction, units, maps, campaign. Adding new things within the same frame as the main game. The problem however is that none of it is particularly inspired.\n\nTwo new factions are introduced, a defensive British army and a mobile German one. However neither of them really brings anything new to the formula.\n\nThe campaigns are an utterly standard experience and although the cut-scenes and storyline have been heavily improved upon the gameplay is inferior to that of the original American campaign.\n\nOpposing Fronts does what is needed, it gives the single-player fanatics a reason to take Company of Heroes back off the shelf. But it does not give them any reason to keep it down.

In 2006 i played that one only beacuse it was amazing from technical side.

OF adds the British and the Panzer Elite factions into the game. Britian is my personal favorite faction, and it favors strong, fortified defence and a generalized infantry-centric army that can deal with any threats, athough not reallty specializing in any field. Meanwhile, the Panzer Elite (Poorly named as they have only one actual tank) focuses on an extremely offensive and mobile army in which highly specailized vechicles perform a narrow role, and thus every unit serves a spefific purpose. Both factions are extremly unique, and do not feel like retooled American/Wehrmacht. OF also adds two new campaigns for the two new factions. In all, if you loved CoH, you will adore the hell out of this expansion.\n\nNOTE: Getting this expansion only, without the base or Tales of Valor, means that you will only be able to play as the British or Panzer Elite.","June 17, 2012","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good thing Company of Heroes - with its expansions - provide something fresh and interesting despite the overused theme of video gaming. Forget the zerg rushes and spams, this RTS emphasises tactical AND strategic view of the map. Territorial control, resource management, and careful use of small-sized units are the very "breathe and eat" core mechanics of the game. Learn 'em, or perish!\n\nIn addition, this is of the rare WWII -themed RTS games, which actually provide an enjoyable and somewhat aspect-neutral German campaign! Without looking too much from the "American viewpoint", the German soldiers are shown as any other men who gave their lives in the great conflict.\n\nIn general, the gameplay is brilliant, and the factions feel balanced enough to keep you playing - disregarding the questionable community debates. Don't forget the great mods, like Blitzkrieg or Eastern Front!","October 31, 2012","true","341.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
