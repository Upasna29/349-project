Tabloids","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198034823626/","440 products in account","Gem Wars is a fun competitive combat platformer with a few unique twists.\n\nAn elemental system keeps the game fresh and ups the intensity as players scramble for the weapons and elements needed to take down the player in the lead.\nWhile numerous rule sets and modifiers let players tailor each round to their personal preference.\n\nJumping is a bit floatier than in most games of this genre, changing the pace a lot.  Its easier to line up shots in mid-air, but if you miss you are wide open for counter attack.  Desperate wall jumping games of cat and mouse are a regular occurrence as you always forget the chaser is just as slow as you are, and expect the killing blow to land any second.\n\nThis isn't just a multiplayer title either, which is a refreshing change.  Sure you have both local and online multiplayer, but there is plenty of meat in the single player game too.  Fun challenges, survival modes and challenging AI are all in this game and it really helps Gem Wars shine.  It's definitely a game you can play for a few hours offline in solo and not get bored.\n\nMy main negative with the title isn't the game itself, but the fact that because its a small indie title it doesn't yet have the following for thriving online multiplayer.  This is definitely a game where you will need to contact a friend for a multiplayer match.  Playing with strangers just isn't realistically going to happen.\n\nLuckily, it comes with a cheaper price tag than most so if you really like the game.  You can always afford a second copy for a multiplayer buddy :)\n\nThe game has attracted comparisons to Duck Game and Towerfall, but its definitely its own beast.\nThe elemental weapons, unique rule sets and floatier character movement all do enough to set this game apart and make it worthy of a purchase if you are keen to explore more of what this genre has to offer.\n\nSo far there have been fast regular updates constantly improving this game, and more to come in the coming months, so it's also an evolving beast. There are definitely greater things to come as this game strives hard to match it with the giants of the genre.  It's a game that knows that to match them for sales, it has to aim to outclass them for quality where ever it can.\n\nIf you're still unsure then grab it on sale and explore it for yourself.  Its a surprising game that won't let you down.","December 29, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The weapons are easy to pummel opponents with, but the tactical items take some getting used to. There's missile launchers and beam weapons, swinging ropes, traps, rocket boots and other cool toys to play around with. People will definitely have a favorite set of items in this game. I'm fond of the launcher+shield combo. The cool thing about the items is that they have limited ammo, forcing you to pick up other stuff and keeping other players from being too powerful.\n\nIt'll take some time to get used to the game's controls. They might feel a bit overwhelming at first but after some time practicing it can be pretty awesome dodging bullets all the while ramming into other players and knocking them into pits. Even when you have your default weapon which is pretty weak, it doesn't mean you're easy prey to other players. This makes the game pretty balanced no matter what items appear.\n\nOverall Gem Wars is easy to pick up and really fun! But, it is challenging to master all the different moves and items at your disposal. The good thing is that learning the ins and outs of the game isn't required to have fun. But once you do, it opens up a whole new world of offensive and defensive strategies, which makes the game even more fun. A tournament scene can easily grow around this game.\n\nCheers to the developer, it can only get more awesome from here! Put a lot more content in and the game will be a must buy on Steam with the $4.99 price point.","July 3, 2015","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/370590/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","It is without doubt that Gem Wars: Attack of the Jiblets has an opportunity to force its into a niche dying out for high quality games on the PC – competitive couch games. Queen Birdface Productions have clearly taken inspiration from the likes of console giant Super Smash Bros. It’s a combat party platformer where the last man standing wins. It has all of the right game mechanics to be a great entry in the genre. Where the differences between titles such as Smash and Gem Wars is is in the key elemental mechanic. Players pick up elements that will transform their weapon with each element creating a different weapon. I can definitely envision a mad scramble occurring for the weapon power ups as they can and do prove to be the difference in winning and losing.\n\nThe single player mode is stronger than I was initially going to give it credit for. Initially I found that the AI in the challenge modes was overpowered but then I read the actual tutorials – a must read to understand how to play beyond the basic controls – and I was able to find them a beatable challenge. There’s a lot of depth to the single player mode  with quite a number of different challenges and a great survival mode giving the game extended gameplay.\n\nAs other critics and reviewers have mentioned due to its lack of popularity the online multiplayer is not thriving. That appears to be the biggest weakness for the game and hence why I wanted to provide the game some of the spotlight that it deserved. In the week that this goes to print it is also a part of the Indie Gala Monday bundle which will hopefully further increase the player base. The developers deserve an opportunity for their game to shine as they have been great towards their community for a long time – even before the game was submitted to Steam Greenlight.\n\nIf you’re looking for a competitive couch game on PC or an ultra challenging single player experience then please give Gem Wars some consideration.","January 8","true","8.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You can customize them in terms of how their eyes look, their mouth, color, and even clothes! Some things you also have to unlock, which makes the customization section that much more interesting.\n\nThere are many different modes, but by far my favorite is challenge mode and local survival. In challenge mode, you can do different things and meet the requirements to actually pass the challenge, and based on your performance you will get a certain amount of gems, which you can later use to unlock things. In local survival, enemies come at you in waves, and the more the waves progress the harder the enemies get and the more of them there are.\n\nThe actual mechanics in this game are beyond amazing. First off, there is a weakness and resistance system, that applies when you change your ability. Fire is weak to water, water is weak to electricity, electricity is weak to earth, and earth is weak to fire. If your opponent is the weakness of your ability, you do significantly more damage. But same rule applies to you, if you have the weaker ability. You can also choose different types of ammunition and weapon types that apply best to you. Additionally, things fall down onto the stage like rocket boosts, spike boosts, shields, traps, etc.\n\nSo in the end, do I recommend this game? Definitely. If I were to rate it out of 10, it would simply be 10/10 no doubt. If you haven't bought this game yet I suggest you go pick it up now :)","February 20","true","1.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steric400/recommended/370590/","steric400","Ryan Dorkoski","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steric400/","767 products in account","Thank you the developement team for generously supplying me with a key for review and feedback purposes. The team certainly seems active on forum, and quite willing to incorporate community input into the game.\n\n---\n\nGem Wars: Attack of the Jiblets is a multiplayer (local and online) combat platformer that has many elements in common with the familiar bunch including TowerFall and Duck Game, among others. The one new mechanic that stands out with this title is that you can mix weapons with different 'elements' (fire, water, etc.), which adds another layer of strategy to play. If your enemy is fire, you best grab that water element.\n\nIn a fairly flooded market, Gem Wars mostly suffers from not really forging its own identity. The weapon/element mixing is great, but just not really enough to carry it on its own. Everything else has been done before - and most of it is fairly 'meh'. Lets just look at the 'Pros' and 'Cons':\n\nPros:\n+Great take on keeping weapons fresh - while there are only a modest number of weapons, they can be mixed with different elements that create a whole new layer of complexity. This is well done.\n+This title is obviously a labor-of-love for the developers, and it shows.\n+Tutorial is pretty in-depth.\n\nMeh:\n=There are lots and lots of game modes, but few of them merit being there. Several are really good, but many seem to be there just to add content.\n=Another example of content fluff is all the different character builds. Fine, they are ok, but hardly different. Reminds me ALOT of BattleBlock Theatre. In fact the art is not dissimiliar, either.\n=I believe that english is not the native language for the developement team, and it shows in certain parts of the text and description in-game (I am not talking about the store page description at this point). This is no big deal, because it can easily be fixed with the right help.\n=At this point, the only way you will play online multiplayer is if you arrange it upfront with someone. There are no 'active' battles being hosted whenever I randomly checked. To be expected, but also to be noted here.\n\nCons:\n-Music is repetitive and not very good.\n-Sound effects are quite limited, and become annoying after a short while (I'm talking like 20 minutes). In particular, the sound associated with getting hit/killed. Probably just needs more variety.\n-Physics are too floaty. Needs *slightly* tighter controls. I feel this is a legitamate gripe because this is the core mechanic for a game like this. If you look at all the top, most well recieved games in this genre, you will see that the all have one thing in common - super tight and responsive controls.\n-I know they were trying to keep a child-friendly rating, but I think it seriously detracts from the game, and basically robs it of any identity. What is a gem war? What is a jiblet? Its all kind of silly. Once again, I like the weapon idea, but the characters and the actual weapon visuals feel generic.\n\nFor this price, there are a metric ton of better local (and some online) multiplayer games to play. Too many to list, in fact. Finally, I do these reviews for my Steam friends - I don't mean to come off harsh - but I honestly would not tell my friends to run out and purchase this over other titles.","December 18, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","16"

Actually I kind of ♥♥♥♥ talk them on the podcast a lot. Not the individual games themselves, but the concept of local multiplayer on a PC. It's just not my cup of tea. However, I mentioned the release of Gem Wars on the last episode of the podcast(here's the exact spot on the video version - https://youtu.be/mvZwFEoOzLk?t=23m26s) and was contacted by the developer with a key and asked me to check it out. So I obliged.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/jaYhR--_qE0\n\nI'm glad they reached out to me. This game is just oozing charm. From the upbeat soundtrack to the hand drawn sprites.  The music, in particular, plays right into a frantic back and forth co-op game, high energy and fits the gameplay. The art shows in the detail of the level design and character design. The character design in particular allows you to customize your eyes, mouth, head, tail and a few other options. Giving you the ability to separate yourself from your friends and make your character unique to you.\n\nThe gameplay control is a tried and true platforming. What separates this game is again it's charm. All the weapons you pick up feel and control differently. The shooting aspect just feels really good. You will also have access to a tactical set of items that change the playing field by dropping bear traps or placing temporary walls. I can't speak to the actual multiplayer portion, however, I have to imagine it plays just fine.\n\nMy only gripe is the way controller support is handled. Having to map my own controller seems odd and kind of out dated. I'd love to see an update that would recognize the controller when plugged in and maybe a tutorial that shows what those buttons do. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ trying to remember which button is the "Advanced" key.\n\nKeep an eye on this one though, the developer plans to roll out an Adventure Mode which will be more single player focused and a Colosseum Mode that will be an online campaign that will allow you to make friends, have rivals, and wager bits on matches. (Bits are the currency you earn from playing to purchase some of the character customizations)\n\nOverall, Gem Wars is a low cost co-op platformer with so much charm you'd think it was a picture of a cat on the internet.\n\nCheck out more reviews at EarlyAccessMedia.com, YouTube.com/EarlyAccessPodcast and Join the Early Access Podcast Group here on Steam!","July 1, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","4","10","2","0"
