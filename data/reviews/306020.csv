"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BilllCipher/recommended/306020/","BilllCipher","Bill Cipher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BilllCipher/","162 products in account","Bloons TD 5\nBloons TD 5 is Ninja Kiwi's latest installment in the Bloons TD series. It is a strategy tower defense game with a large number of towers and maps to have fun with. I will include a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nIn Bloons TD 5 you start off with a simple dart monkey, but as you play and destroy more and more bloons you unlock up to 17 towers to use. For single-player there are 57 maps  categorized into 5 levels of difficulty (beginner, intermediate, advanced, expert, and extreme) and there are 32 maps in co-op which are divided into 4 categories (beginner, intermediate, advanced, and expert). As you choose a map there are 4 options of difficulty (easy, medium, hard, and impoppable). There are multiple ways to play such as apocalypse, deflation, and the ability to reverse the track. Each of the 17 towers has 2 upgrade paths which each feature 4 upgrades however when you choose the third upgrade for one path the other path locks down. Each tower has different behaviors and special uses. There are upgrades which boost different part of your gameplay and buildings available for purchase (in-game money) which boost certain towers. There are special agents you can buy to give you an edge and daily challenges along with special missions. There is odyssey mode where you defend multiple tracks to get a reward. Towers even have abilities you can unlock to help give you an edge (one way or another). Bloons TD 5 is slightly addictive and packed full of content on Steam.\n\nGraphics/sound\nThe graphics are polished, smooth and well-done for a tower-defense game. An interesting thing in this game is how the character icon on the bottom left changes as you upgrade your towers.\n\nThe music is simply joyful and relaxing. The only problems would be the fact the eventually you will only hear bloons popping. Luckily you can mute the sound and/or music if you want to.\n\n\nFlash vs Steam version\nThere are quite a number of added things to Bloons TD 5 that are not included on the flash version. While the flash version is free it does not have a laboratory to upgrade your items and does not contain the Monkey Engineer and Bloonchipper. Steam has a whole new difficulty for players to face (impoppable) and does not have micro-transactions lurking in the corners. Everything on steam can easily be achieved by doing daily challenges and just playing the game. Odyssey mode does not even exist in the flash version. The only thing that flash has that steam does not is the ability to message another player in co-op. The lack of communication is a huge loss in teamwork and the ability to last for more rounds.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ 17 towers to choose from\n+ 57 maps in single-player and 32 maps in co-op\n+ Music is relaxing\n+ Specialty building for towers and laboratory\n+ 4 levels of difficulty\n+ Many different ways to play\n+ Monkeys vs Balloons (funny concept)\n+ Odyssey mode and daily challenges\n+ Missions for cash\n+ Daily Reward\n\nCons\n\n- No communication in co-op (this is a huge issue)\n- Many people will randomly disconnect in co-op\n- In co-op people idle and remove any sort of co-operation\n\n(The main issues in this game are lying within co-op)\n\nFinal thoughts\nI have always loved the Bloons series ever since I first discovered it on kongregate. This game is the highlight of the series and is amazing in almost every aspect. I love that there is no micro-transactions and there is a whole other level of difficulty. The only problem that shines to me is co-op with its lack of communication and how some people act (idling/ quitting out of the blue when you are about to win).\n\nTL;DR\nIf you are a fan of the flash version this will be worth your time with 2 new exclusive towers, the new laboratory, impoppable mode, no micro-transactions, and odyssey mode. I recommend first checking out the game on NinjaKiwi to get a sense of the general gameplay and decide if you want to buy this along with all its new and fun features or not.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","August 10, 2015","true","56.5"," 206 of 219 people (94%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","94","206","219","19","8"

However my spirits were rekindled when I found an email from Ninjakiwi in my inbox giving me a free activation code for this game. This goes to show that Ninjakiwi care for their customers and their customer support is outstanding as I have had to email them many times before and have been replied to very promtly. Aside for this, the game is somewhat different to BTD5 Deluxe in the fact that the store does not have as many purchaseable items and instead these have been put into the tier 4 upgrades of the tower buildings you can build in the menu of the game. There are a lot more tracks to play on which I am very pleased about and the replayability value of this game has increased with all new modes such as an impoppable mode which is one difficulty setting above hard. New content is everywhere in this game and lots of updates are being prepared or so Ive heard. Even though I got this game for free thanks to Ninjakiwis wonderful customer service I would still purchase the game as it is wonderful and will give you many hours of playtime.

There are a wide variety of maps, challenges, missions, and unlocks.  Co-Op can also be very fun.\n\nMy one complaint is the game runs if full screen mode.

If you like tower defence games I highly recommend this one. BTD5 is by far the best one out of all of them. For the steam version they took their online one from their website and their mobile version of it and made it into one.\n\nThe Specialist Buildings has four upgrades like in mobile vs three like online.\nYou also have the towers that are from the mobile version.\nYou have the Monkey Lab.\nThey are keeping up with the updates very well on this too\nYou by far get what you paid for and if you have the deluxe one you get this one for free. (thats how I got this)\nSomething I think is nice that is new is the fact you can see how much XP you have and how much it is to level up, this is the first time they have done that.\n\nThe only bad thing I have to say about this is when you play co-op, you don’t have the chat option that you have on their website. When you play easy it is not bad but for the harder maps and higher difficulties it is very useful to be able to talk.

In Bloons TD5 you use an array of towers, mainly consisting of monkeys, to destroy balloons on a range of different maps. Bloons started its life as a flash game but this particuar version is a mobile port as far as I'm aware.\n\n+Nice cartoony graphics\n+The gameplay is very simple, you just place your towers in places where they can easily shoot incoming bloons and that's it, choosing the right tower is also important but again that's easy to learn\n+Lots of towers\n+All of the towers have a total of eight possible upgrades\n+Upgrading a tower changes it's aestethic, usually quite drastically, which is nice and adds a bit of variety\n+You can double the game speed if you so wish\n+Lots of tracks\n+Addictive gameplay\n+Lots of hotkeys to make you more effecient\n+The towers are very different to each other though most of them involve monkeys\n+Suitable for all ages and it more directed to a younger audience (in my opinion)\n\n-It feels a lot like a flash game which isn't overly surprising\n-The maps are small which isn't great when it's such a fast paced game as the bloons go by very fast\n-When you're playing a level there is a thick cartoon border which not only takes away space for the map but it never changes so it's incredibly boring to look at\n-Waves have to be started manually and there's no countdown system like most TD games have, this really slows down gameplay unless you are completely focused on the game\n\nVerdict:\n7\n\nA decent TD game that everyone should play at least once and of course is a must buy for fans of the original flash games.\n\nEl K.","February 16, 2015","true","1.7"," 92 of 134 people (69%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","69","92","134","12","18"

If you were thinking this is anything like that then you are wrong. The game has inhanced graphics, better mechanics, (mortar tower isn't annoying to upgrade anymore) new towers, an assortment of new gamemodes, and no premium shop. (kinda) The new towers are fun and easier to figure out and understand (besides the helicopter) for example the bloon chipper, sucks in bloons and cuts layers off. The helicopter though, I don't get it. Maybe it's because I don't use it since I have strategies with the old ones or that it's complicated but I never see it being used. Here's a list of pros and cons though.\n\nPros\n- Easy to understand interface and nothing is ever cut off or hidden.\n- Shortcut keys in this feel super useful versus never needing them on the flash version\n- Impoppable gamemode is impoppably hard, it's a good thing!\n- New towers are fun and easy to work into any endgame strategy\n- Enhanced graphics are beautiful and work with the maps\n- Charming art style\n- Lots of replay ability\n- Premium shop doesn't let you "pay to win", it should really just be called the shop\n\nCons\n- Helicopter tower may be bugged, may be useless, idk\n- The game gets very monotonous very fast\n- Daily challenge on impoppable difficulty can be impossible, either towers cost to much and it can't reach an area or\nsomething else along those lines can happen.\n- You can't cross a Ninja Kiwi account with this one so you must restart\n- Ranking up is very slow once you hit like 25\n\nOver all it's a pretty good game with a lot of things going for it. 8/10 would recommend to everyone\n\nAlso if anyone could tell me how to use the helicopter that would be much appreciated","April 12, 2015","true","11.5"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","21","21","3","4"

Unlike the original release version of Bloons TD5 Deluxe, this new Steam version has absolutely zero lag in the later rounds. They really did improve the late game performance! I am running a four year old rig (Gateway FX with Intel i7 930, AMD HD 5850 1024MB, 9GB DD3 Memory) and I am at round 103 with zero lag.\n\nPros:\n-Runs smoothly at later rounds\n-Has a lot of maps. A LOT of maps...\n-Lots of towers with lots of upgrades. Some towers unlock via secret methods.\n-Many difficulties to challenge even the best players\n-Updated often with new maps and content\n\nCons:\n-Too easy to unlock everything. You can unlock almost everything in one short sitting.\n-There's not enough audio settings. They're only on/off, instead of sliders to adjust sound levels.\n-Some maps are nearly impossible on the hardest difficulty unless you have extra money to spend for special towers.\n\nOverall, get this game. It's a great time waster. You'll be coming back to this game when your favorite online games are down for server maintenance. It's also available on almost every device but the Steam version is by far the smoothest running version.","November 19, 2014","true","2.0"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kbopadoo/recommended/306020/","kbopadoo","KBop a doo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kbopadoo/","303 products in account","Bloons TD5 is a full release of a popular browser game, Bloons Tower Defense. I hadn't heard of it, but the positive reviews and bright screenshots caught my eye when the price dropped to 75% off in a sale. When I installed the game and started it up, I got a message from no less than three friends stating their love of Bloons. I was also accused of living under a rock since I hadn't heard of it.\n\nSo, being a simple rock dweller who has not played the browser/flash versions of BTD, I can only give my opinion as a fan of tower defense games.\n\nThe premise, like most TD games, is simple, something is attacking, and you must defend! In this case, balloons are attacking. Their motives are unknown. Probably they wish to pillage our villages and take advantage of our women. If one slips by you, you lose a life and get that much closer to failing the level.\n\nThe balloons start out simple - regular red balloons you can pop with one hit. They quickly advance to multi-layered balloons, lead balloons that can only be popped by explosions, camouflaged balloons which must be detected, ceramic balloons, or even balloon blimps that explode into a myriad of other balloons when popped.\n\nAs you can guess, your defenses must advance as well! Starting from the simple dart thrower, you will advance to bomb towers, ninja monkeys who can see invisible enemies, minigun monkeys, mortar towers, glue guns to slow the horde of incoming balloons, or ships that can pull a whole blimp out of the sky. Every tower can be upgraded as well, and there are two upgrade paths you can choose to pursue. When you take all this into consideration with the fact there are 21 individual tower types, there are a TON of options and strategies.\n\nThere are also over 40 tracks, 4 difficulties, and the option to play each track in reverse. You can also use the currency you get for beating each track to unlock permanent upgrades to attributes such as attack speed, starting money, popping power, etc. or other bonuses such as Double Cash Mode, and one that increases the range of the Monkey Village (a tower that gives an aura increasing the power of your other towers).\n\nMy one qualm with the game is, it seems to get a bit too easy once you unlock Double Cash Mode and the Monkey Village range increase. It takes the game from a respectable challenge on normal difficulty, to very easy even on the harder difficulties. But there is still plenty of replay value, and I am still challenged on Impoppable (the hardest difficulty).\n\nI also love the visual style, and it runs smoothly even when there are thousands of balloons on my screen. It will start to lag a bit if you get to the higher levels in freeplay mode. I also really appreciate some of the quality of life additions, like the option to automatically run through the levels (ie. skip the pause time in between levels) for experienced players.

The stand-alone Deluxe version has been my latest purchase of the franchise and I never regretted it.\n\nThe steam version (got it for free because I own the deluxe version) is a pretty much 100% copy of the deluxe version with less stuff BUT is programmed in flash which means that your machine doesnt lag out on higher rounds which was the case on the browser and deluxe version (round 100 took me 15 mins easy, getting to round 235 was a 2-day job) which is BIG.\n\nIf you like tower defense this is pretty much a MUST-HAVE title, try it out for free on the net if you are unsure about it. But when it comes to content and complexity (and lovingly design) Bloons is unmatched\n\n10/10","November 24, 2014","true","308.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

As Ninja Kiwi's most popular and rapidly-expanding game, Bloons TD 5 has found its way to Steam. It's not very unreasonably priced, nor is it identical to the flash version. This version of Bloons TD 5 is similar to the one released for iOS and mobile, as it includes way more maps as well as three new towers - the monkey engineer, the bloonchipper, and the submarine. The game is interactive, as you can play with friends cooperatively, and there are a vast amount of settings for each of the levels to keep the player busy. The harder, faster modes offer a more challenging take on the game, though easy/medium mode is fairly simple for anyone to play. The game is really straightforward. Basically you start off with a designated amount of money, which is used to fund towers (usually monkeys). The towers attack the balloons (or bloons) that zip through the track every round. As the amount of bloons and their variations increase, the towers must be upgraded for more concise gameplay. The more medals you win, the more levels you unlock and the more achievements you earn. You also get monkey money that can be used to purchase extras or "special agents" to be used in-game. It runs smoothly so there's no problems there. The game doesn't take up much space on a computer (unlike other games). Personally, I greatly enjoy this game. I played the original version a lot before, so I was excited to venture into this broader form of the game. Leveling up the towers while battling the huge bloons is thrilling and challenging. This is also a much better option than getting Bloons TD 5 Deluxe, as all of the content from that game is available in this one. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys tower defense games or has played any games within the Bloons franchise before.","September 15, 2015","true","18.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Much, much faster graphic rendering, without lagging like in the Deluxe PC version.  Lots of new tracks, new features, and new upgrades.  So far my only complaints are that a) when playing in fast forward version, it's a bit more straining on the eyes than the Deluxe PC version; b) one can ONLY play in full-screen mode (which is incredibly annoying to me); and c) the specialist building upgrades for Monkey Aces (the "Ace Private Hangar") do NOT activate the forward-firing gunner (allowing for targeted shooting without the Neva-Miss Targeting upgrade) on either the Level 3 or Level 4 upgrade levels.  As this is my specialty building of choice (besides the Dart Monkey explosive darts upgrade), this is frustrating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordAperion/recommended/306020/","LordAperion","♤♈☯LordAperion☯♈♤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordAperion/","44 products in account","It's about time that I talked about this game indepth.\n\nFirst of, I've been playing Monky Bloon Tower Defence games since the early stages of the internet. I've followed the series pretty close and if I could actually document the time I've invested into the game series..It would exceed 1000 easily. It's a pretty fly expansion into what has already become a successful story.\n\nPros:\n*Lots of Towers to choose from. Some do better than others, but situations or maps will rise that you'll need to use the ones you don't normally use. A Submarine tower is introduced in this game and it's awesome.\n*Spy Towers (Going back to the last point) are wonderful. Without spending any bananas (In game currency) and using the money you made on the last map, you can really put a good start on any difficulty. Different ones have different perks, but they are all immensely helpful for any difficulty or map.\n*You now have the access to making one tower more powerful. Boomerang towers can throw two at one time or Bloon Chippers can stun every bloon that goes through it. It makes the game less dull.\n*Maps are nicely made and the artwork is fluent. Putting the towers on any map isn't hard.\n*The Replayability of this game is expansive. Achievement hunting is a thing. Also you now have Special Missions, Daily Challenges, and The Oasis (Which is just a Gauntlet of three/four maps for prizes/cash).\n*When playing Solo, the game rarely lags.\n\nCons:\n*One of my main problems with this game is the Co Op and the mechanics. Obviously it wasn't well thought out and let me explain why. You have limited communication, I MEAN you may as well be talking to yourself at this point. The only way to communicate with the other is to press a button that asks for money. So what ends up happening is, you have all these banana farms and your partner is clicking the button repeatedly. Often times, I can't give him any bananas because we're playing on Impoppable (The hardest mode) and I need factories for my side of the map to help me build larger towers. Most people will quit the game mid match and all that time you spent is waisted (either playing by yourself or finding another match for this to happen again). It really needs a chat window so I can tell the other partner what I'm going to do and what works best with my playstyle. (Minimalistic and Dangerous).\n*The Lag in Co Op is awful. It doesn't happen until you get some serious business going on, but what happens is that you Pop faster than the computer can load. You often wait a full minute or two for a single round. People will disconnect due to this or just potato computers. It adds in A LOT of frustration.\n\nRate: Banana/10\nIf you like solo games that are cute, easy on the computer, and fun to play..I'd recommend this one. It takes a little time and its nice to get away from the big games that I play to come here and build towers.

This game has ALOT to do, PLENTY of content that would take you hundreds of hours to even complete most of. Yet people still go out there and spend 60 on a game youll play once. Dont listen to them, $10 is extremely good and its well priced for sure. Its totally worth the $10 if you enjoy these types of games, its not for everyone.\nNow the review\n\nAmazing game, best $10 you will ever spend. This game is so fun and enjoyable. Played this game a lot of my phone and BTD Battles on my phone but i didnt like that as much.\nPros\nlots of content\nGreat variety\nConsistent gameplay\nFun art style\nSpecial agents\nBest tower defence game ever made\n\nCons\nlittle too easy to unlock everything, there needs to be a way to unlock things by skill not time\nNot enough towers (there are 21 non special agents which is alot but i wish there was more)\nSome towers are not equal. Either they are really good for their cost or really bad, no middle\n\nHighlights\nSpecialty buildings, these allow you to using the ingame monkey money to unlock a "land plot" for a tower, monkey village and the farm do not have one but every non special agent does. These have 4 upgrades, 1st is the unlocking the plot of land (not all same price) which ALWAYS just makes the tower and its upgrades 5% less, also raises by 5% ANOTHER towers cost and upgrades, so in this case a trade off. 2nd will add a bonus, 3rd adds a bonus, and 4th is their better bonus. This is what usually gives a tower its bigger advantage, sadly most specialty buildings are not worth it, actually speaking as somone who has played BTD since BTD2 i can say that these buildings are not worth it. I would say about 5 of them are worth buying, 8 tops.\nWhat would make the specialty buildings better would be much more equal advantages compared to others along with EVERY buildings LAST upgrade adding a ANIMATION tweak ingame. As of now only the engineers sentries change shape and color due to the specialty building upgrades. No other tower that i can observe has a physical change.\n\nAnother highlight is its just amazing idea, bloons in different shapes, colors, types against dart and other material throwing monkeys. The idea may seem silly at first but you will soon (hopefully)  grow to love it","May 13, 2015","true","83.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They've got an excellent gameplay formula. The tower diversity as well as upgrades to both the player as well as towers add a lot of flavor to tactical approach, and overall replayability is excellent.\n\nThat said, there are a couple fundamental flaws to watch out for:\n-The first and perhaps most crippling is the random crashing that will occur if you're the sort of player that likes to squeese towers into tight spaces at the very border of the 'placeable areas'.\n(Note to developers: I feel this likely has something to do with the coordinates arrays and warrants some looking in to.)\n-The second is the net code. In many cases this isn't a very big problem, but on some poor connections to the other player, the client has trouble keeping up with game cash balance updates. There have been times I've had to wait as long as 5-10 minutes on the harder difficulties / longer games while the other player's balance was updated on my screen.\n\nBoth of these issues can be avoided however, so they should not necessarily sway your decision to get this game.\nAll in all, worth every penny of the $9.99 USD I paid for it.\n\n4.5 / 5 *","May 12, 2015","true","279.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordAperion/recommended/306020/","LordAperion","♤♈☯LordAperion☯♈♤","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordAperion/","44 products in account","It's about time that I talked about this game indepth.\n\nFirst of, I've been playing Monky Bloon Tower Defence games since the early stages of the internet. I've followed the series pretty close and if I could actually document the time I've invested into the game series..It would exceed 1000 easily. It's a pretty fly expansion into what has already become a successful story.\n\nPros:\n*Lots of Towers to choose from. Some do better than others, but situations or maps will rise that you'll need to use the ones you don't normally use. A Submarine tower is introduced in this game and it's awesome.\n*Spy Towers (Going back to the last point) are wonderful. Without spending any bananas (In game currency) and using the money you made on the last map, you can really put a good start on any difficulty. Different ones have different perks, but they are all immensely helpful for any difficulty or map.\n*You now have the access to making one tower more powerful. Boomerang towers can throw two at one time or Bloon Chippers can stun every bloon that goes through it. It makes the game less dull.\n*Maps are nicely made and the artwork is fluent. Putting the towers on any map isn't hard.\n*The Replayability of this game is expansive. Achievement hunting is a thing. Also you now have Special Missions, Daily Challenges, and The Oasis (Which is just a Gauntlet of three/four maps for prizes/cash).\n*When playing Solo, the game rarely lags.\n\nCons:\n*One of my main problems with this game is the Co Op and the mechanics. Obviously it wasn't well thought out and let me explain why. You have limited communication, I MEAN you may as well be talking to yourself at this point. The only way to communicate with the other is to press a button that asks for money. So what ends up happening is, you have all these banana farms and your partner is clicking the button repeatedly. Often times, I can't give him any bananas because we're playing on Impoppable (The hardest mode) and I need factories for my side of the map to help me build larger towers. Most people will quit the game mid match and all that time you spent is waisted (either playing by yourself or finding another match for this to happen again). It really needs a chat window so I can tell the other partner what I'm going to do and what works best with my playstyle. (Minimalistic and Dangerous).\n*The Lag in Co Op is awful. It doesn't happen until you get some serious business going on, but what happens is that you Pop faster than the computer can load. You often wait a full minute or two for a single round. People will disconnect due to this or just potato computers. It adds in A LOT of frustration.\n\nRate: Banana/10\nIf you like solo games that are cute, easy on the computer, and fun to play..I'd recommend this one. It takes a little time and its nice to get away from the big games that I play to come here and build towers.

Improvement from the Web Version, as it adds 4 pretty good new towers, my favorite being the Bloonchipper, as well as having ALL the towers from BTD5 Web Version. Along with this, there is now MUCH better graphics. I also somehow feel it is easier to complete any track on any difficulty.\nSpeaking of difficulty, this installment also adds a new difficulty! Impoppable! Impoppable is basically Hardest Hard Hard,\nbecause all things that change by difficulty are HARDER THAN HARD. (i.e. bloon speed, price of errything etc) EXCEPT you only have ONE life. I honestly think Impoppable is EASIER than hard, because it strikes a form of pep into your actions, making you extra careful to not lose your ONE life.\nAll in all, I would rate 19/20. Gr8 g@m3.

They've got an excellent gameplay formula. The tower diversity as well as upgrades to both the player as well as towers add a lot of flavor to tactical approach, and overall replayability is excellent.\n\nThat said, there are a couple fundamental flaws to watch out for:\n-The first and perhaps most crippling is the random crashing that will occur if you're the sort of player that likes to squeese towers into tight spaces at the very border of the 'placeable areas'.\n(Note to developers: I feel this likely has something to do with the coordinates arrays and warrants some looking in to.)\n-The second is the net code. In many cases this isn't a very big problem, but on some poor connections to the other player, the client has trouble keeping up with game cash balance updates. There have been times I've had to wait as long as 5-10 minutes on the harder difficulties / longer games while the other player's balance was updated on my screen.\n\nBoth of these issues can be avoided however, so they should not necessarily sway your decision to get this game.\nAll in all, worth every penny of the $9.99 USD I paid for it.\n\n4.5 / 5 *","May 12, 2015","true","279.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sharktrexer/recommended/306020/","Sharktrexer","Drunken Sharkcho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sharktrexer/","110 products in account","This review is separated into two parts; One for buying this game without playing the browser version and one in mind that you did play the browser version.\n\nFor the People Who Didn't Play the Browser Version\nBloons Tower Defense 5 (BTD 5) is the first BTD game to get on Steam. This means that there is no BTD 1-4 that you will find on Steam.This game is a very unique tower defense, having very unique towers (a total of 21) that each have their own ways of popping the games "protagonist" bloons. Some towers can pop some types of bloons the other can't, making you need to have a variety in your placed towers. Some towers even need a specific land type (A.K.A. water) to be placed. Each tower also costs an amount of cash, which you get from popping bloons. So if you don't spend th cash right, you can't expect yourself to win.\n\nNow, each tower doesn't just shoot at the bloons coming for you in a dedicated static path throughout the map (more on that later) each tower also have different projectiles they shoot. Some shoot an arching boomerang, while one shoots an exploding cannon, while some just shoot a piercing dart. Each tower also has a different and unique upgrade tree, leading them to shooting different, and more deadly projectiles, as well as having abilities on a cooldown. You don't just place towers and watch them shoot at the bloons, you have to also do some managing, as there is some strategy needed to really make where you place the towers, count. To also have some strategy added, there are support towers, that don't shoot bloons, but help you other towers perform better.\n\nJust like most tower defense games, there are different types of "enemies" (bloons) that come at you. Some are immune to explosions and freezing, others are undetectable and need special towers to attack them, while others just take a bunch of hits to pop. Either way it keeps the onslaught of bloons interesting and dangerous. You also have a limited amount of lives which the stronger the bloon, the more lives it will take from you when it reaches the exit. But... the waves that come at you are always the same, never changing, so you know what to expect, which could get stale for you. There is one remedy...\n\nDifferent maps! Each map is classed in how difficult the map is to try and keep the bloons from getting to the exit. Most maps have a unique theme and path that can keep you entertained, from there being 2 paths where the bloons come from, to having them do loops around an area. Some maps also have some awesome music to keep you wanting to keep playing.\n\nNow BTD 5 also has some interesting unique things you can do to help you defeat those darn bloons, and to keep your interest the game high. First of all there is XP and leveling up. Each level you earn unlocks either a new tower, a new upgrade, or even a new map. There is also a research center that you can use to generally help you, like make all your towers shoot faster, or to give you more starting cash at the start of the round. There are also temporary towers that last only last one game, and place-able objects you put on the track to pop the bloons, which can create some dumb and fun strategies you can make up!\n\nPros   A very unique Tower Defense game\nLots of special elements to keep you playing\nAn easy game to get addicted to\nYou can easily pop in and out of a game\nCo-op\nAn easy learning curve\nCons   It still is a basic tower defense game\nThe resolution is bordered on the sides\nThe resolution isn't that great to really begin with\nThe game can get stale quite fast\nIt probably isn't worth the whole 10 bucks\nI honestly think this is an amazing tower defense game to get into, and I highly recommed this game!\n\nFor the People Who Did Play the Browser Version\nNot many things have changed since the browser version. New features include 4 new towers, a new special agent tower, HD graphics, a new monkey lab which enables you to almost upgrade every tower and to upgrade general things, some new maps, and a 4th tier on the specialty class buildings. I played the browser version a lot, and I mean A LOT. I found this steam version and I wanted it right away. I don't regret it as I had 10 bucks lying around and I've been enjoying it. It'll be up to you to conclude if you want it, as really the BIG upside is that there is no micro-transactions.\n\nPros   Better Graphics\nThe game doesn't run on you browser\nThe game won't lag in the late waves (unless you have a REALLY bad computer)\nNo micro-transactions\nNew towers, maps, and other cool stuff\nCons   The new graphics may not appeal to some people\n10 bucks isn't a great price\nStill the same old BTD 5 in retrospect\nI do still recommend this to you, even if you have played the browser version, as it can bring you to play the game more, and to love it all over again.\n\nConclusion\nI honestly think, whether you have played the browser version or not, this game, even suffering some cons that could turn off a lot of people, I think it is still worth it, no matter if you are either, getting into the tower defense genre, a tower defense game fan, or a BTD die hard.","June 26, 2015","true","23.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

Any benefits that you may purchase can be deactivated, meaning that those that are more insane, such as the Double Cash Mode, can be disabled at any time to avoid the game being too easy while still being available in case you are struggling with a daily challenge or want to let your younger siblings or kids play.\n\nContent-wise, there are over total 50 levels over five difficulties; Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced, Expert and Exteme. Each level can in turn be played in four different difficulties, all available both in normal and reverse paths. This should offer a challenge for both those new to tower defense games and the more experienced players.\nThere is also a simple coop mode, which simply splits the map and money in half, and allows you to hand money to the other player. You can play both with steam friends and a random quick match. While this doesn't offer that much new, it is very fun to be able to play with friends.\nThere are ten special missions available that make you think creatively, as well as 250 random missions with varying themes and difficulties. The special missions at least, are replayable at a lower rewards, in case you want to complete them differently, maybe with some perks disabled.\nAlong with all this content, there are also weekly odysseys, which are 3-5 levels(depending on difficulty) that you must complete in a row, rewarding great treasure, and daily challenges(which is to complete a level with only four available towers) at all four difficulties so you can earn some extra cash.\nIn short, there is no shortage of content and always a reason to return.\n\nThe downsides are that the levels are fairly repetitive - all difficulties have a set order of bloons incoming in the rounds. The option menu is also somewhat lacking, the only options being cloud upload/download, mute/unmute music, mute/unmute sound effects and windowed mode, as well as a language options and the ability to change controls between click and drop and drag and drop.\n\nAll in all, I would recommend the game to anyone, and at the current price it's basically a steal!","July 27, 2015","true","271.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Usually this means it is missing the app or something, but when I've looked at all the computer's files of BTD5, They are identical. I have no idea what has caused this, but it won't let me play anything. You'd be better off playing the website version for free at the moment... However, I do remember when it DID work, it was much better. It was definitely worth the money. IS it worth it?\n\nWell, yes and no. It's a good game, but it doesn't work. I'd say no. If they fix this, then it is definitely a thumbs up, it comes with new towers, maps and even a new game mechanic.\n\nTL:DR: Recently it hasn't been working on several computers.

It is well worth it.  The only features I would add is the ablility to have BTD5 automatically sync your progress in the steam cloud rather then you having to manually go and back up your data in game. Also a way to sync my progress between my phone and my computer would be a nice addition.

I love this game.  This is the gold standard.  If you like TD, this is where you should be.\nPlayed the IOS version for abut 100+ hours, unlocking most abilities, beating most of the levels up to Unpoppable.  I'm buying this version now because the lag is too insane when playing the later difficulties.  This game might set a record for "most explosions at once" as it's not unusual to pop 100s (if not 1000s) of incoming bloons in one go, especially later with abilities, which makes my smartphone & gameboy glitch out.  It's a good game on the phone & java, but this game is too good for those platforms & fully desereves a space on your computer if you are serious about winning the later levels.  The lag spikes are pushing your hardware to its limits as "Bloons" pushes it's own pop-p-ping possibilities.  After all of this, I am willing to buy it on a 3rd device.  I *want* to win!\nThe RPG like aspects of alternate advancement paired with penalties make the classes brilliant, each specialty helping to solve levels in unique & creative ways.  The grind is fun and sensible, feeling naturally progressive with challenges.  What begins as a normal TD game turns into semi-real-time gaming with abilities needing to be qued up at the right times.   The further you go, the faster their cast time may be reduced, resulting in what essentially turns into an action / quick turn-based game of sorts.  For example, one must collect bananas as quickly as possible.  Like it?  Tap away!  Don't like it?  Level up the Bloon Shredder to do it automatically for you!  This is brilliant thinking for those of us who would like a choice in our play style.\nThe tactical placement of towers allows for lots of creative control.  There is no wrong way to build things if your monkeys are skilled.  Some levels require very unique strategies.  With radar, some units can be used for recon, allowing for submarines to destroy bloons from afar.  The Monkey Hut especially allows for grand strategy, as all buffed monkeys must be within it's range.  Having 3 huts specializing in say, ability timers, money, & power mean that 3 stations will be doing separate tasks and then have multiple monkeys (even of the same class) doing different jobs.  This is pertinent to aim, which completes the formula, allowing monkeys to target the first, last, closest, or strongest bloons, plus a few more specialty shots for other classes.  The combinations seem endless.\nThis is a TD game we're talking about here!  It sounds more like a TBRPG or war game.  Popping bloons may seem silly, but it's progressive casual play grows over time to seriously difficult insanity.\n\nThis is Bloons.  It's the most fun I've ever had playing a TD & one of my favorite games of all time.  I can go to it to relax.  I can go to it for a real challenge.  It's good ol' family gaming fun.  I can't recommend 'Bloons' enough.","July 20, 2015","true","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sometimes if you quit in windowed mode it will crash everytime you try to open it. There was a fix posted by the developer on the steam forum for this game. It is very annoying to fix this espicially for a $10 game that you can play for free on their website. Otherwise the 60fps and HD textures are very good, and the additions of the subs, baloon chippers, and copters is very nice.","January 24, 2015","false","61.7"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","8","18","0","0"

To me i find this offensive and saddening, it's like they've given up on putting it in. there are some new things to this verion however like the new towers ( engineer, helicopter and the bloon chipper) and a few new tracks. I would stick with the website version unless you what the achievements or to use the new stuff that's in this version.\n\nPros:\n-Cartoons graphics that work well with the game\n-New towers\n-New upgrades to buy with coins (Coins you get in-game)\n-No pay to win mahanics like in the website version\n\nCons:\n-Free verion on website\n-No coop chat\n-Easier\n\n-DeathKillerRock\nI rate 4.5/10","December 29, 2015","false","153.7"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","9","22","0","0"

New to this version is Co-op/Multiplayer this felt very half-backed because the Co-op has you controlling 1-side of a map and the other player the other, this felt pointless as I never felt like playing these modes though because there is no real point to it becuase the connection can be bad not saying it is always bad it just is a bad idea that could have improvements and to 'fanboys' out there I don't care if you think having one side while your partner has the other is good, because it is not. finale co-op thoughts, add both players can place buildings anywhere however the maps used for the split co-op are well planned but make me feel like that one side i'm playing is one whole map. And finnaly lets move onto "is this better then the FREE one on Ninja Kiwi" and to that I say there is no significant difference apart from a few new towers for example: Helicopter, Submarine and Bloon-Chipper (all of which come with their own tower upgrade path) so I would say you don't need to get this at all if you don't mind the small lack of towers, play on Ninja Kiwi and save your money.      4/10\n\n+New upgrades that add small bonuses\n+Fullscreen (with boarders) feels great\n\n-Very few new towers that are not worth the money\n-Unoticable/boring Co-op/Multiplayer\n-No graphic change to web version\n-Game lacks enough new features to make the cost worth it\n-the only way to obtain the premium currency (gold coins) is by completing levels and agents should not cost gold coins but instead be given to you when you complete levels","June 27, 2015","false","14.4"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","36","5","14","2","0"

If you need 1 map and there are 13 then you have a 1 out of 14 chance of getting it and thats not counting the chance that the other player doesnt need it or will Diconnect for whatever reason. when you finally get the map you want. you have to pray that the other person doesnt disconnect later in game because that is a lot of wasted time. Sometimes you get lucky, and the person just doesnt need map and will dc right away. Id recomend the free version its not better but this version isnt worth much more than the free version since you cant beat free. if you can get it for 60% off go for it.\n\nPS game is a HUGE grindfest if you want achieveys. If you just like TD games this is one of the best but the free version on ninjakiwi or kongregate is where you should be,","February 18","false","185.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

I always played the other verison, which is the free online verison that's pretty good, but you have to pay for some stuff in it sometimes. So when I saw this I was like: 'Oh sweet, Bloons TD 5! Look at the new looks and everything!' So I bought it and it seems really good so far. There are a few new towers, and LOTS of maps. Anyways to the pros and cons!\n\nPros:\nThis game is something you can play for a while\nLots of towers which is epic\nLess lag than the other version! (If you had lag, I haven't gotten any lag yet)\nYou don't need to pay for other things! (What I mean is no micro transactions)\nPop, pop, pop\nJust a really fun game overall!\n\nCons\nCo-op is somewhat buggy right now\nStuff is kind of easy to unlock\nMusic and sound need some sort of bar. Basically you can only have it on or off, which I find a bit annoying.\n-----end of pros and cons-----\nSo that was my review! I have to give this game a 10/10 really cause the cons are just VERY minor things for me.","November 27, 2014","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And after giving this "Tower-Defense" of a game a chance, I am glad I did. This is easily the most addictive little co-op strategy game worth the $10 dollars for it. It has endless replay value with a huge variety of "Monkey" tower defenses that you use to keep the variety of balloons from reaching the other side of the maps. Best of all it is a quick to jump into Co-op game, with lots of unlockables and achievements to get. The game goes from being so easy to raging hard, and that isa good thing. Its a game with monkeys! Come on! I only recommend this ultimately because of the co-op play you can have with your friend. Only flaw is that they split the map in two, so you only get one area to defend while your partner guards the other...which in my opinion dulls the true strategy experience to work off of eachother.

I like how all the in-game premiums can be purchased with in-game money, instead of using microtransactions. One problem I've been finding with this game is that it crashed a few times on me. It shouldn't affect the experience too much. I would have preferred more options, for example a volume slider instead of just on and off. More graphical options would be nice.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/recommended/306020/","Illius19616","Illius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/","88 products in account","Imagine: You're a monkey minding your own buisiness in your jungle home when suddenly you are attacked by your most deadliest predator; a herd of baloon shaped creatures called Bloons. They are deadly, terrifying, and worst of all, THEY FLOAT! So you naturally gather your monkey bretheren to defend your homelands using everything at your disposal, such as darts, catapults, bomber planes, battleships, and Terminator M0N-K3Y.\n\nThis game, while being a simple tower defense has a nice sense of charm through it's use of arts and resources. It also stands out in that unlike most tower defense games that use the same formula of "Air, Ground, Armor, Etc." units, you instead have bloons that have lives and the only real unique types are "Camo", "Lead", "Bomb/Freeze Resist", and "Regen", all of which have some way to counter them either through creative use of your buildings. Some towers spot nearby Camo bloons to attack, some give other towers the same ability. Some towers remove the camo altogether. All other types are just stronger versions and break down into their weaker counterparts in 1 hit, excluding Ceramics (Which break after a few hits), and MOAB Class, which are in essence bosses.\n\nFor those of you who played Bloons TD4 or lower, or played the flash version of this, it is a straight upgrade. Obviously, 5 is greater than 4, and they do a nice job of improving. New towers, refining old ones, adding new strategies. However, if you've played 5 and are still on the fence before actually buying it, realize you are buying everything in the flash version, plus the stuff you would otherwise have to pay extra for, PLUS about 10x the overall content. It is worth the $15.\n\nPros:\n+Great mix of towers and upgrade paths (Where in other TD games you just upgrade, these actually feel as though you are impacting the game instead of just powering up. Some upgrades include faster fire rate, all the way to making a monkey turn into a giant temple of pure Bloon Poppage).\n+Upgrades allow for immense strategy (Some are mutually exclusive, some you want to prioritize)\n+Map Variation always keeps you entertained (Each map has their own path, and pathing rules (such as 2 starts, 2 exits, splits, loops, Large bodies of water for certain towers, etc.), and you have to plan around how to take advantage of the map (1 tower one 1 map may not work as well on the next).\n+Consistency (You play one wave, you can expect that wave again, and it helps you translate from map to map, so you aren't blindsided with a cheap loss)\n+Difficulty Matches Skill (If you play for the long run, you are going to find it gets tougher, but if you are good enough at planning ahead it definitely feels as though it pays off (Making it to wave 130 vs to wave 60 feels good)\n+MONKEYS\n+RAVENOUS BALOONS!\n+Challenges (For when you get tired of just playing normally, you can play with special rules in play)\n+Strategy outside of maps (Few TD games do this: You can buff certain towers while between maps at the cost of weakened other towers, or get "Agents" who are powerful one map towers with no cost to them besides monkey cash you get from winning.\n+Freeplay (You beat the final wave. At this point you can continue on after to see how far you can last without hurting your win. In fact, you get rewarded for making it far enough.)\n+Great tutorial. Your first play through it will guide you through how to do certain things, warn you of upcoming waves, etc. And it will do this until you choose to turn it off.\n+The payoff for planning ahead (You can be doing amazing one wave, but if you didn't budget for something that can, say, kill Camo Bloons, the next wave will punish you hard).\n+Manual Towers (Some towers can/are controlled via Mouse, instead of a behaviour, meaning that you can manually choose how you want your towers to hit. Abilities also do the same thing.\n+Progression. Your towers become more powerful the more you use them in that more upgrades are availble to them, and after a certain point of playing long enough and popping enough Bloons you get the powerful tier 4 upgrades, which can range from dropping nukes to turning all units to Super Monkeys.\n\n\nCons:\n-Multiplayer isn't consistent. Sometimes it works flawlessly, sometimes it won't even connect.\n-Waves always appear the same (Wave 65 on Normal is Wave 65 on Hard.)\n-Very little change in difficulties (Hard is almost the exact same as Medium, except you need to survive more of the same waves that can be accessed through Medium's freeplay, and you start out with less cash and lives which doesn't really matter later.)\n-Challenges don't like new players. If you don't have all upgrades availble, a lot of challenges will not be within a realm of plausibility, so if you don't use a tower a lot (like me and Freeze Towers), it will slap you and say "USE IT!"","December 19, 2014","true","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't, you should go try it. It's a flash game that you can try for free, and there is a good amount of content included in the bought version. I bought the Deluxe Edition from NinjaKiwi long before it was released on Steam, and after beating it there, I've put Hours upon Hours into it, beating it again. This game is fun. Relaxing, Bloon popping (With friends) fun… With exploding Pineapples, Mini guns that fire rockets, and Spike-O-Pults, this game is worth every penny.","January 5, 2015","true","71.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am even more impressed now that not only do I have the pleasure of being able to play this game for free as a result of that, since they sent me a steam key for this game, but this version is even better. I was a rank 69 on Deluxe and I already know I'm going to get much higher than that on this game because it wasn't a simple remaster, but there were many other things that were changed as well, and I believe they were all for the better.\n\nFirst off, right from the beginning, the title screen has been completely redesigned with all the deluxe upgrades being split up into two different categories. There is a new currency you earn as a result, in addition to the monkey money (that's what I call it, anyways). There are still no microtransactions and the upgrades dont feel extremely overpowered. They are small percentile bonuses that you can increase as you get more tokens. Tokens are unlocked by playing each track and higher difficulties yield more tokens.\n\nIn addition to the redesigned upgrade system, there are new tracks, towers, and even new special agents. There just appears to be something new everywhere. It's really quite surprising. To top it all off, seeing all the remastered tracks after playing the Deluxe version so much is really a treat. They really did a fantastic job on remastering these tracks. I recommend this game completely. 10/10","January 1, 2015","true","100.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the low play times by me, I've played this game for hundreds of hours on the online version. :P\n\nFirst off, for people new to this series, you pretty much have a wide array of monkeys that you use to defend from an  invasion of balloons called "bloons". Concept is simple, but it works so well.\n\n+ Lots of towers! Towers are all unique (A few might feel a bit similar to each other though), and can be upgraded with 2 path options.\n+ Lots of maps! Tonnes! You won't get bored!\n+Co - op is great! I mean, it's not perfectly implemented but it's great fun with me and my lil' sis.\n+Steam integration\n\n- Eh to be honest there are no real downsides to this game (I'll update this as a continue to play though)\n\nOverall is worth the $10, expect to get at least a minimum of 10hrs play time even if you aren't into the game a lot.","July 27, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not the sort of game you'll play for hours at a time, it's more like something you open up to play when you have 20-30 minutes free and don't feel like getting super invested in anything. Sort of like a mobile game for the PC.\n\nEven though this is essentially a port of a mobile/flash game, it has enough polish to make it feel like it's worth playing on a computer. I actually enjoy playing it a lot more on the computer because you have a lot better control over where to put towers and a lot more access to useful information.\n\nThe only thing I don't really like is how it's kind of boring in the beginning to do all the tracks on easy. You don't have to do them on easy if you don't want to, but if you're like me and want to get all the medals, then you'll be spending a lot of time being kind of bored. Honestly, I feel that if you complete a track on a certain difficulty, you should also get the medals for all the lesser difficulties. Instead of making us do each track three times to get the Olympian achievements.\n\nThere ARE microtransactions in the game, as in the PC versions, but you don't need them at all to complete everything, so don't let them put you off.","January 31","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game deserves your time and money. Besides, you'll be hooked in the game as soon as you upgrade your first monkey.\n\nPros\n- Tons of different kinds of towers with each tower having TWO teirs of bloon popping mayhem\n- Multiple kinds of bloons that have unique abilities like lead bloons being immune to darts\n- Upgrades to make the game easier like more starting cash and lives during games\n- Having a constructed building on the menu that makes certian towers cheaper or have better abilites than before\n- Tons of new maps being uploaded nearly every few months so that if you're getting bored of current maps, don't worry\n- Daily challenges keep you from leaving the game because you don't have long before a new challenge updates\n- Agents that are special towers that have unique effects than the regular tower and cost monkey money, than the money in-game in the rounds. The agents reward you with a permanant upgrade of that agent if you use 50 of them in games\n\nCons\n\n- Saving the game to cloud doesn't work. So if you had a level 60 on your other computer, you must start all over again on the current computer\n- The CO-OP is full of hackers (that doesen't upset me because i get badges for completing the map faster)\n- Lag issues in late game like round 100+ so it stresses you out seeing bloons go at 1 FPS so if you have great patience, this game is or you, unless you have a powerful computer (recommend really fast computer)","January 27","true","50.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Namely the double cash mode.\n\nThe first couple days of playing this were great. A little bit of a grind to unlock everything but ultimately challenging and enjoyable. The moment you unlock double cash mode though the game basically plays itself. Hard levels become a breeze and on easy you seriously don't even see any bloons appearing on screen because they are all already dead from the dozen submarines or dartling guns you built by wave twenty.\n\nWith the normal cash mode the game feels well structured and balanced but with every token spent in the extra starting cash upgrade it becomes slightly easier and gives you more options to use. Then you spend $7500 on the double cash mode and all of that careful balance and design goes out the window immediately. It hardly even feels worthwhile playing it now.\n\nIt was then that I remembered that in the flash game double cash mode was a premium upgrade bought with real cash instead of ingame currency. In other words: pay to win. Between this, the token upgrades and the new overpowered towers the game rapidly becomes hugely unbalanced and completely without challenge.\n\nYes, you can turn this stuff off and play without it but the game gives you no reason not to use it. Some of the levels are almost certainly impossible on the hardest setting without these things turned on.\n\nUltimately then what you have is a game with two options:\n1. Force yourself not to use the new content you have paid for in order to make the game a challenge until you eventually just get bored or infuriated with repeating the same level over and over and quit.\nor:\n2. Turn on double cash mode, build an entire fleet of submarines almost immediately and watch the game stutter to 20fps as they all fire in unison and beat the game for you.\n\nNeither of these options seems very appealing to me anymore.

So the game never becomes unfair, because you can try many different tactics.\nThere is also the possibility to do random missions, where you are only allowed to use a specific number of towers, so the game becomes even more tactical. I really like these missions, because they brings some variety into the game.\nThe only thing bothering me is the coop mode. It is not like you are working together with someone, it is more like you are sharing a map with someone else and you build your towers how you like it. The communication is missing and that doesn't make it feel like a coop. Otherwise if you have a friend who you can communicate with then it might be a lot of fun.\n\nAnd last but not least: the little monkeys are too cute :3","August 6, 2015","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not saying it's a bad thing, it's just not entirely polished for the PC. There's a major lack of communication in the multiplayer which sucks. It makes co-op incredibly awkward, especially in tougher levels.\n\nAs a long time BTD fan, I was slightly disappointed with the PC version, as you're paying like $7 more for the same exact thing as the mobile. I still enjoy playing it, and the convenience of being able to play the mobile version on my PC is loads of fun, I've got a pretty beefy PC, so I can go a lot farther than I can in the mobile version as well.

I came home from school a year ago. My friend typed on skype: ''Man you gotta see this game'' I checked out the online version and i got addicted. My grades went from 5 to 4 or even 3. I started to eat less and played more. Leveled my ♥♥♥♥ up and was basically buffed up. Soon started to play with other persons. Then it came to steam. As i couldnt afford it at that time i got it as a gift. I was so happy. I hoped at first that i will have all my data but as for my suprise. Every single item was gone. All levels. All perks. Everything. I sighed. I turned off steam and went to bed. I tought about life. What is life? What is my mission? .......MY MISSION IS TO LEVEL UP MY NEW BLOONS TD 5 CHARACTER. I turned steam on and started playing. I soon got 2x money so it was easier to do the stuff. Soon i was buffed up and olso my friend was playing this. So we play it quite often.\n\nAfter all... this game sucks. Im sorry but it isn't like that. ITS AMAZING! ITS AWSOME! I LOVE IT SERIOUSLY! The HD graphics are quite good , i like the new towers. The  gameplay is very addicting and makes me want more and more. You need over 1000 hours to have game 100% achievements and other maps and all.\n\nAfter counting:\n\nGraphics: 7.5/10\n\nGameplay: 11/10\n\nAddicting: over 9000 / 10\n\nGreat job Ninjakiwi!

BTD5 is by far the most polished of them obviously :P  I bought this game for my Ipad as well as for my android phone.   Great time waster when you're bored to figure out different combinations of towers that work well together.\n\nAs for this version?  Well Co Op is pretty much broken.  You absolutely do not have the option of talking to the person you are playing with.  I pretty much do only do random co op, just like I did on the html version, however on there you could actually talk to the person!\n\nHopefully this is just a bug, but now I can't join a co op random game at all on the steam version now (it has worked up until about 2 days ago)  That's a minor inconvience to some, more of an inconvience to someone like me who has NO friends that play this game....  Oh well.\n\nOverall this game is worth it for sure.  If you are new to tower defense games you will have a blast, and if you are a vetran of TD games you will defnitinely enjoy this one.  They took a different take on game mechanics from the norm for sure, and it  was well worth the gamble :P","July 19, 2015","true","107.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ninja Kiwi is amazing, and the entire BTD series in incredible. That being said, this game is availible in browser-based form for free, and on various smartphone stores for 2.99. The only difference between the browser-based version and the steam-based version is a small handful of special towers, already on the smartphone versions.

You can't choose what map you wanna play in, you just get a random one. Making it so, that you start to run more often into maps you have already beaten and therefore can't get a new medal = most people quit game and re-search\n- Occasional game freeze + crash, occasional savegame corruption (maybe once every 100 games for me) Yet still annoying when you have invested time and effort to get to say 83/85 map and game dies on you, leaving you only with losses from buying agents.\n\nOverall I would recommend this game for people who enjoy casual relaxed TD. 10€ Fairly high price indeed, but in terms of how much time you can spend playing this game, it ain't that much.\nI would rate 4/5. Max rating when they decide to add some type of possibility to actually play co-op with random people.","April 6","true","50.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are much better and are HD and make me think "wow, the browser version is so ugly" every time I see it. There is no Pay to Win features and everything can be bought with in-game money. Tracks and towers from mobile are included, and because it isn't browser based, it runs much more smoothly, especially on the later levels.\n\nThere are, however, some things about this that dissapoint me. For example, this game came as a replacement for the BTD5:DE, but this one comes without the deluxe edition content, which made me sad, because it was the main reason I got the game in the first place. Another thing that I didn't like was the Co-op, as players frequently left with no reason, and it took me atleast 10 tries to get a decent game with someone who wanted to actually play. On top of this, there is no Co-op chat system (at the time this review was written)\n\nDespite this, I would reccomend this game if you can get it cheap during a sale like I did, Just gotta wait for that DE content :p","June 27, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Co-op mode is the reason you must buy this game right now. The Co-op mode divides the screen and each player can build only on his side. It's SO MUCH FUN!!! You can play with your Steam friends or you can search for random people to be matched with. Since there are a LOT of people playing this game, you can find players very quickly. It usually takes me less than 10 seconds to be paired with someone. On both private and random people Co-op mode, you can choose the map difficulty and the match difficulty too. Seriously, it's so much fun to play a Co-op tower deffense! Additionally, there are toons of stuff to do, like daily challenges and stuff. There are NO microtransactions once you buy this game on Steam. You'll spend money only once and play it forever. Towers and upgrades are locked in level 1 and they are unlocked as you progress (and you can't speed things up with real money, which is good). You'll progress in a reasonable time, don't worry. There are lots of things to learn and strategies to test, so you'll unlock things more quickly than you can use then. If you like Tower Deffense games, this game is a must have! Bloons is a classic series and this one, in my opinion, is the best Bloons game so far.","July 21, 2015","true","34.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although on mobile and on a flash version aswell, this version is frequently updated, without ANY micro-transactions for any unlockable in the game.\n\nPros:\n\n- Faster, non laggy gameplay, no matter what round you are on.\n- Many more maps and towers.\n- Extra features such as : Odyessy mode, Daily Challenges that are sorted in difficulty, and over 200 random challenges for you to conquer.\n- All content, even those that used to cost Ninja Kiwi's coins, is all purchasable through monkey money, or ingame money.\n- New difficulty level "impoppable" where, this time, you probably shall not pass. Only 1 life provided.\n- (For people on flash version -) A new monkey lab which you can spend tokens, given from completing maps, to enchance your monkeys and other helpful things small amounts at a time.\n-And just in general, better art style and graphics.\n\nCons:\n\n- Well, Ninjakiwi basically fixed ALL noticeable bugs\n\nIf you are contemplating about that $10, hopefully this helped you.","April 20, 2015","true","27.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Buying this goes straight to the developers so they can make this game more awesomer, as they themselves say.\n\nThis version has many more features, including the features from the old BTD5 Deluxe (yet to come) plus new towers, maps, offline play, premiums not costing real money, Monkey Lab, Impoppable difficulty, new special mission (No Escape) and more awesomeness.\n\n2: What is BTD5? I haven't played the flash version.\nYou haven't? You're missing out. BTD5 is a tower defense game with large replayability, dozens of maps and special missions, funny art style, monkeys, special agents and more. If you prefer one tower over the rest, you can buy a plot of land for Monkey Money to make Speciality Buildings, which boosts one tower but makes it's supposed opposite more expensive.\n\nThere are 4 difficulty modes - Easy, Medium, Hard and Impoppable - plus some extra modes such as Deflation - where you get 50k cash and that's it, Apopalypse - where there's no pause between rounds and Sandbox - where you get infinite money and lives, and you spawn the bloons.\n\nThere are 14 types of bloon currently, ranging from the basic red bloon, to the armoured lead bloon, to the tough-as-nails ceramic to the fearsome Z.O.M.G.\n\nThere are many towers with different specialities and 2 paths of upgrades with 4 upgrades each. Once you have the third upgrade on one path, you can't have it on the other. Alongside these towers, there are road items which you can use when strapped of cash or a bloon has slipped through your defense.\n\n3: It's expensive... :(\nAs I said, this version is worth the £7 ($10) price tag. Plus, if you had BTD5 Deluxe before this came out, you get this free. Could it be any better?\n\nMy final verdict: 94.5/100. When they add the BTD5 Deluxe missions and maps, it'll be 100.\nAmazing tower defense game.\n\nBONUS: Check out the Ninja Kiwi archive forums if you're a fan. You'll find (actually decent) fanfiction, forum games, suggestion areas and update news, and more.\n(http://archive.ninjakiwi.com/Forum)","September 15, 2015","true","97.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Bloons TD 5 introduces different kinds of upgrades outside of the main game to permanently improve the towers' capabilities and upgrades that can change the gameplay itself.\n\nIf you like Tower Defense games, give this one a go because it might look child-like, it has different difficulties for every type of player.

This version is overall superior to the online version on the Ninja Kiwi website because it has more towers, maps, special agents, and a variety of neat stuff.  The game might get a bit boring from time to time, and it may seem easy at first, but this game can be very challenging at times.","December 11, 2015","true","77.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's get right into it\n1. Premuim upgrades. All buyable upgrades now have to be earned through honest gameplay\n2. Better Co-Op with Steam\n3. Offline play, or being able to play without access to internet.\n4. Support to Ninja Kiwi. Bloons Tower Defense is an incredibly addicting game which you will easily put an entire afternoon into without skipping a beat, that being said it's nice to support the creators with a measily 10 USD\n\nREVIEW\nBloons Tower Defense Knocks it out of the park with some of the best tower defense gameplay available in the market. Besides a standard play that consists of 30+ levels all with unique artwork and level design there's also 4 difficulties, and 4 game modes. On top of that there's special missions, Daily Challenges, Co-Op, And tons more! I would recommend this game to both casual and hardcore gamers alike.","August 25, 2015","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At that point there is still a lot to do in the game. In fact, way too much to do in the game. There are so many levels and power ups and achievements and whatnot that either you'll buckle down and decide to put the extra 50 - 100 hours playing all the levels, getting all the medals and everything else or you'll force yourself to write a review and delete the game.\n\nProbably one of biggest pushes in the second direction was realizing that the strategies for each regular level don't need to vary so much for success. Special missions and daily challenges force you to get more creative but don't add a whole lot to making the game fun again. It's like continuing to play Mario 64 after you get the special triple jump - there's nothing really left to do except mess around, and there are just too many other games or things to do at this point to make a 30 hour game a 100 hour game.\n\nStill, those were 30 good TD hours.

I got it on sale for $2.49\n-my game lags more than on the flash version. it also gets messed up when the game tells me i unlock a level or a challenge\n-some modes you have to unlock by paying monkey cash,where in the flash version you unlock them just by leveling up\n-audio, more than often, stutters. and when it does, you better get some noice-canceling headphones\n\n\n","July 30, 2015","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the low play times by me, I've played this game for hundreds of hours on the online version. :P\n\nFirst off, for people new to this series, you pretty much have a wide array of monkeys that you use to defend from an  invasion of balloons called "bloons". Concept is simple, but it works so well.\n\n+ Lots of towers! Towers are all unique (A few might feel a bit similar to each other though), and can be upgraded with 2 path options.\n+ Lots of maps! Tonnes! You won't get bored!\n+Co - op is great! I mean, it's not perfectly implemented but it's great fun with me and my lil' sis.\n+Steam integration\n\n- Eh to be honest there are no real downsides to this game (I'll update this as a continue to play though)\n\nOverall is worth the $10, expect to get at least a minimum of 10hrs play time even if you aren't into the game a lot.","July 27, 2015","true","18.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

So the game never becomes unfair, because you can try many different tactics.\nThere is also the possibility to do random missions, where you are only allowed to use a specific number of towers, so the game becomes even more tactical. I really like these missions, because they brings some variety into the game.\nThe only thing bothering me is the coop mode. It is not like you are working together with someone, it is more like you are sharing a map with someone else and you build your towers how you like it. The communication is missing and that doesn't make it feel like a coop. Otherwise if you have a friend who you can communicate with then it might be a lot of fun.\n\nAnd last but not least: the little monkeys are too cute :3","August 6, 2015","true","37.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is exceptionally frustrating considering how much time is wasted cumulatively just trying to get through the menus that are clearly designed for mobile platforms. These menus could be easily improved and would reduce the amount of time not playing significantly. The following questions help clarify these menu and GUI issues:\n\nWhy do I need to turn pages to see all the towers available?\nWhy do I need to go to settings to turn on auto-play when there is room all over the screen? To include the bars on the left and right making a 4:3 aspect ratio.\nWhy do I need to scroll through all the targeting priorities when you could easily click the one you want (like in the flash version)?\nWhy can't I select the maps or upgrades from an easy list rather than swiping optimized method (I know there is a sorting method but this is insufficient)?\nWhy is it that when I click on a tower next to another one, my selection alternates between the two when I am clearly clicking on only one of them?\n\nDon't get me wrong, I will keep playing the game but the menus are absolutely frustrating. Play the free flash version, the extra towers and maps are not worth the cost (at least at full price), and definitely not worth the cost of time navigating. It is dissapointing, if the menus were actually made for PC this game could be an easy recommendation and very enjoyable.","August 15, 2015","false","187.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

ABSOLUTELY YES. i rate this game 10/10 for it's originality and gameplay.You won't even notice how fast time flies by while playing this.THAT'S HOW FUN THIS IS.(Btw NinjaKiwi if you can reply to me please do so, i will frame it on my wall)","August 25, 2015","true","32.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let's get right into it\n1. Premuim upgrades. All buyable upgrades now have to be earned through honest gameplay\n2. Better Co-Op with Steam\n3. Offline play, or being able to play without access to internet.\n4. Support to Ninja Kiwi. Bloons Tower Defense is an incredibly addicting game which you will easily put an entire afternoon into without skipping a beat, that being said it's nice to support the creators with a measily 10 USD\n\nREVIEW\nBloons Tower Defense Knocks it out of the park with some of the best tower defense gameplay available in the market. Besides a standard play that consists of 30+ levels all with unique artwork and level design there's also 4 difficulties, and 4 game modes. On top of that there's special missions, Daily Challenges, Co-Op, And tons more! I would recommend this game to both casual and hardcore gamers alike.","August 25, 2015","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmilyPawpaw/recommended/306020/","EmilyPawpaw","Emily","http://steamcommunity.com/id/EmilyPawpaw/","339 products in account","So, long-ish ago I had the flash game in my browser bookmarks.\nOver time I totally forgot about it, but then I saw it discounted for ~2,49€ and thought "Yes!"\nI was interested to see what would be different compared to the original,\nand I gotta say I'm very satisfied with my purchase.\nIt's got improved graphics, more maps and way less lag in the very late rounds than the flash game\n(which is to be expected)\nSo, for those who know the flash game, that's a recommendation.\n\nNow on to the ones who didn't play the flash game:\nIt's a very good Tower Defense game with unique aesthetics, towers and enemies.\nOccasionally the path the Bloons are gonna take is not entirely clear,\nYes they're marked on each map but when the lines overlap it's unclear which way they're going first,\nthough that's also not a big problem. The Entrance is always marked, so you know what's coming.\nEach tower itself has 2 upgradable attributes but after the second upgrade to both you need to pick a path,\nwhich leads to an entirely different unit. The Basic Dart Monkey, for example.\nFirst you can upgrade the range and the attack power.\nThe branches lead to a spiky-ball-catapult and a tripleshot, respectively, each with their own advantages,\nand besides that part of strategy, each map also offers many options for tower placement, and you'll\nwanna think it through. Though Easy mode is pretty much impossible to screw up.\n\nSo, there's only one real criticism I have and that's probably due to my own stupidity.\nThe messages you receive when starting a game are repeated each game.\nThere might be a way to disable those but I didn't really look for it yet,\nbut one thing that usually annoys me slightly is a repeating tutorial text x3\nAgain, I think I'm just too thick to find the button that disables it.\n\nOverall, I love it, it's just very unique and well made.

J.","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198128389132/","18 products in account","IF you have played BTD5 or other bloon related games on the web then you may or may have not liked the whole browser setting. I did not. So alternitive was just playing my many bloon games on mobile devices intill the steam version of this game came to be. At first I though "why first give the game out free, then make people pay for the downgrade (you do get content early on mobile) then make a copy of the game and sell it on steam?" and while it sounds bannanas this works. I highly recomend this as an additional account for your bloon hunting needs. The format is simply the best out of all three ways to play in my opinion. Money well spent.\n\n(edit) With one very last note on hand I must say that for being the only game in the BTD universe that you pay more than $5.00 up front (other than deluxe) you kinda desiver more. While the game is great and as before I highly recommed it this price is very and I am going to say it. Expensive! I luckily got this game on sale for no more than $3.00 instead of $10.00 but that was just my luck. This game has better graphics, nice interface and setting, no longer hard to upgrade and control unique driven and targeting towers, and most of all you no longer pay to win. With the new system you pay in-game currency to get things like health bannanas, big becons, and tokins. My only complaint about that is double cash in the steam version should be taken away as that is just cheating. Otherwise yeah this is a great game.\n\nI really hope and this is just on my wish list of BTD related things for all to read. I wish that for owners of the BTD Dulex (me) should get a code that they can easily enter in the BTD5 steam and retrive the new and exlusive moving tracks such as the island and bannana factory, not be forced into popping 250,000 bloons before getting the new tower (the sub) to make up for the fact that the engineer and bloon chipper are already released to everyone else. I paid $25 for that version of BTD5 and honistly this is bold BUT I waisted my money on that version. For $10 (or less :)) get this game and be happy that you just got the best copy of BTD you might ever get if they continue updating this version as regularly or more of the time. Just really wish I could have those moving tracks for the money I spent...\n\n(edit2) I am sorry for making this so long but I love to read and edit again so on a very last note I would like to say you should get the new tower (sub) early and beable to upgrade your steam BTD with a code you would retreive from your BTD dulex because you can still buy dulex and last time I checked it's now $15, who is going to buy that when you can buy this? If you want the tracks you will. So I suggest that you guys advertise dulex edition on the BTD steam page for $5 or less dolars as a addon to this version (the steam version). Give owners a code and have the new tracks. PS. I think people who got dulex should get a $1000 exstra in-game cash for being a dulex owner but thats just me!\n\nI rate this game 8/10 for it's simplitcity but fun. It easily gets boaring so while you must get this game it's really a time killer that requires lots of focus.","July 26, 2015","true","93.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What was that website again?\n\nI suck at reviews.\n\nBuy this game if you loved playing it on Ninja Kiwi but to be honest $10 is really steep but It's nice to support this and also it's pretty refreshing to start all over. Although it sucks since you don't have all the towers and upgrades unlocked but it sure is fun to play through and unlock them all over again.\n\n10/10 would buy again on sale.","August 2, 2015","true","78.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The browser version no longer works on my computer, so I've had this on my wishlist for a while. It's a fun game and has a few more towers than the browser version. I do think that you should wait for a sale, because a few more towers isn't really worth $10, but it's definitely worth it for under $5. You can also get BTD5 (this version) on iPad and iPhone.","July 21, 2015","true","32.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A couple years later I found out the Ninjakiwi made Bloons TD5 and I freaked out, however I was a bit disapointed that it had mircotransactions so I didn't play that game as much. However once I saw that Bloons TD 5 was on steam and on sale I had to buy it. And so far I'm loving the game.","July 21, 2015","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
