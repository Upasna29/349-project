The map was snow canyon and after several rounds I was finally able to cycle into the sniper position. 18v18 game. I find a nice place to go prone in the foiliage by a log and survey the battle to the best of my ability. I'm way too far away and its hard to get a clear shot, I'm feeling more and more useless as time goes on because I cannot see anybody. Before long, I check the team status and discover I am the only guy left alive on my side whereas almost the entire enemy team is alive.\n\nRight about then, I'm getting general chat messages thrown at me like grenades:\n"KILL YOURSELF"\n"STUPID SNIPER"\n"THIS WILL TAKE FOREVER"\n"HE IS ON TOP OF THE CANYON, KILL HIM"\n\nI do my best to ignore them, my heart starts pumping. Then I see an enemy.\n\nJust like they tought me in the in-game sniper training, I found a target across the canyon running parallel to me. I fired and he went down.\n\n"NICE SHOT!"\n"HAHAHA"\n"♥♥♥♥! HE GOT ME!"\n\nThen I see another. Bang, dead. My heart is pounding with excitment. I reel around to the bottom of the canyon where it looks like someone is shooting at me. I have the superior advantage. Bang, dead.\n\nBang, dead.\n\nBang, dead.\n\nThe chat is going absolutely crazy.\n\nI don't know how I did it, but I managed to take out the entire team single handedly in one of the more realistic sniper sims.\n\nLog onto another server and promptly get owned, and conistently get owned from that point on. I don't care, this epic moment keeps me warm.\n\nAwesome game even though its a propogandic as all hell 15/10","April 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 490 of 602 people (81%) found this review helpful 274 people found this review funny","81","490","602","274","16"

I'm a Vietnam vet, a 2-tour NCO, a wounded -combat- vet, BTDTGTTS, dear reader. I wasn't one of the REMF's. I'm also a man that's spent a lot of hours playing other shooter-type games on the PC, occasionally on consoles. I prefer the PC. I don't enjoy the easiest, or the hardest, setting, prefer the medium-tough degree in single-player. I seriously wanted to enjoy this game, but....\nI do not enjoy online play. I've tried it a lot, in numerous other shooter games. While AI can at times be -odd-, in their style, you can at least learn mostly what to expect. I can't say that about online play, I just do not like playing with, or against, other human players. I'd probably have a lot of fun with this game, IF it had a single-player mode. Sure, maybe it's because I'm -old-, I am, but it's a GAME, folks. It's supposed to be fun. I don't want a crowd of children, whose reflexes are twice as fast as mine and have time to do virtually nothing but play games, repeatedly kickin' my ♥♥♥. Sorry, it's simply not my idea of a good time.\nIf they ever release this game with a single-player mode, with a good story and thoughtfully crafted missions, I'd likely be one of the first to buy it, but as long as I have to compete against children, it's not fun.

A real team based First Person Shooter which rewards players for helping each other. For example, the faster you medic teammates, the less damage they will take to a limb when they've been shot in that area.\n+ Realistic firing mechanics. When an enemy is shooting at you, aiming becomes much more difficult and guns are not always 100% accurate.\n+ Most maps are small, which would traditionally be viewed negatively. However, this complements America's Army 3 because it allows players to become experienced with the environments, memorise key spots and provide accurate communication to teammates without confusion.\n+ Decent graphics, could be better though.\n+ A First Person Shooter which actually concentrates on skill, quick reflexes, constantly assessing your decisions and leaning around corners instead of blindly charging in like Call of Duty. The game is tactical but fun, deploying smoke grenades and flashbangs at the right time is useful, but they're balanced and not overpowered.\n+ Steep learning curve. This is a game for true First Person Shooter players. It isn't for the impatient or those who want to "respawn". Once you die for the round, you're out. So the game is about survival and teamwork, not personal glory and "leet solo skills". That said, it would be a mistake to compare this title to ARMA or Operation Flashpoint games. There will still be times when you are the last man standing and need to hunt down the enemy against the odds - good fun.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- With the release of America's Army: Proving Grounds, the sequel to America's Army 3, this game lost a large proportion of its community. In fact, the entire Australian group has left, and there remains only a few servers of dedicated American veterans with a love for the game. So, if you're from the United States and interested in this game, give it a go.\n- Limited weapon selection. The developers did this to reflect real-life military loadouts, but you aren't even given a pistol or knife as a secondary weapon. There are two main guns in the game, the M249 SAW and the M16/M4A1, with optional optic sights. Not a great amount of variety there.\n\nOverall Score: 8.5/10\n\nAmerica's Army 3 is an underrated gem. Having played it over the course of a few years in excess of 1,000 hours, I can honestly say this game has huge replayability. Definitely download it.","February 18, 2014","true","083.0"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/recommended/13140/","pepperbelly","PepperBelly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepperbelly/","285 products in account","Alright, let's talk about America's Army 3.\n\nIf you haven't already guessed, it's the third installment. Coming from America's Army 2, it's a slight let down. That said, the game does have far better mechanics then it's predecessor (AA2), and even it's successor (Proving Grounds). It has all the mandatory and fundamental features/mechanics you expect from a tactical shooter. The game has a very authentic feel when playing it tactically. However, all that falls apart because of the poor server performance, terrible netcode, and inconsistent hit detection; sometimes you'll slay everyone left and right, and other times your weapon appears to be firing blanks.\n\nBecause of that, the game ends up benefitting from a more aggressive, run & gun style of play. So you'll see players firing in fully automatic, spraying down targets, strafing back and forth, spamming grenades, and so on. If you're the kind of guy (like me), that takes things slower, covering every angle and watching every corner, you should come out on top. But when it comes to shot placement, it's very inconsistent. You'll be the one to take accurate, semi-automatic fire at an enemy, and he'll spray back at you, and more often than not, he'll win the firefight, strictly based on the poor hit detection. Even though you line up those shots perfectly center mass, they'll feel like they do nothing at all, and even if you do win that engagement, chances are you were wounded in the process.\n\nIn short, this is an incredible game hampered down by those issues. If it was well polished, bug free, and had excellent online server performance, this game would be amazing. I want to love this game. I really do. It is an addicting game, with interesting gamemodes, and realistic weapon handling and maneuvering.\n\nThe reason why I'm recommending this game, is because it's FREE. It costs you nothing, and it's a decent experience. But you'll no doubt see the potential the game has, and wish it was better in all those areas I covered. Even with all its faults, I prefer it considerably over that of Proving Grounds, which in my opinion is an abhorrent game and a disgrace to the America's Army series.\n\nIf you want to see what AA2 was all about, look up "25Assist." It's a community made effort to bring America's Army 2.5 back to life, and has been running since around 2010. If the same love and care that was applied to 25Assist was applied here for AA3, it would no doubt be one of the best tactical shooters out there.\n\nIn the end, it's fun, and you may enjoy it, but you'll just keep thinking about how much better it could be.","January 27","true","16.0"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","0"

It's aging a bit now, and the game's community/development has been replaced by that CoD wannabe pretending to be an America's Army game. BUT this is still a great game.

The AI on it, some of the training, and especially the special forces training section can help anyone improve their FPS game--regardless of what game you regularly play.

You go to the army to undergo a boring training and die a quick and painful death. When you see this as just a game that happens to be produced by the US Army it does not really work as well. While clearly the focus is realism, the game is hardly playable. The maps have far too large walking distances. Graphics looked great, but FPS dropped a lot on mid-range hardware of that time. Objectives were not really clear so it boils down to deathmatch. Actually people amassed on the servers playing the smallest and simplistic map available (some kind of bridge) and it became a slow paced sniper challenge with a very long time to respawn.

After meps you wil than get shipped off to basic training (where the game takes place) The game is literally a blast and its pretty accruate on the test that happens during basic. Found it really cool that you have to pay attention to your teacher in order to get the correct answers on your test. This is what i called a realistic simulation of basic. Online mode is pretty well done and many people still play the game!","February 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","55","23","42","3","1"

It is a team based FPS, like a cross between Battlefield 2 and Counter-Strike. You play either as the US Army or as the Opposing Force who are generic baddies. The teams battle for various objectives on a variety of maps with an array of real and fictional weapons - the fictional weapons are used only by the Opposing Force.\nThe heart of the game are the team-based multiplayer battles. There is no free-for-all deathmatch; everything you do is geared toward the idea of working as a squad of US Army soldiers.\nThere are plenty of problems, such as glitchy animations and weapons bugs. Also the graphics could look better, therefore that it uses the Unreal Engine 3.\nAmerica's Army 3 can be really good if you have a good connection to the server and if you can find other motivated and cooperative players. But it can take hours until you are able to find that combination.\n\nSounds 7/10\nGraphics 6/10\nGameplay 8/10\nAtmosphere 6/10\n\nIf you liked my review, please feel free to follow me and/or my curator group:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Ov3RT4K3R/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/orcollective#curation","June 2, 2013","true","0.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

It is almost a perfect simulation of how an American military skirmish actually works. If you want realistic war first person combat this game is for you. If you however are more in to Modern Warfare, stay away from this game. You don’t get to call in air strike. This is simply the more realistic version of counter strike source. Don’t be fooled by this game’s graphics, it’s a total computer resource hog. Lags like a ♥♥♥♥♥ on my low end pc, runs fine on main. So if you have a subpar pc don’t expect it to run very well. There is virtually no content in this game, there is a class system and a leveling system, everything else is below average.

Individuals with prior accounts can no longer continue using their screen name. Therefore, new accounts must be created even for veteran users. Medical training is now compulsory allowing all players to give basic IFAK treatment. While America's Army had training availability based entirely on previously completed training, America's Army 3 has only basic training available initially and online play is required to unlock more training. In addition, a single map can support multiple mission types, while in America's Army a single map only had one. A new feature in America's Army 3 is the ability to melee enemy combatants in battle using the rifle butt, allowing for a more realistic close combat situation should both sides find themselves out of ammo. America's Army 3 also eliminated the ability for the characters to jump, done to eliminate the practice of bunny hopping-type evasive maneuvers. However players can still climb onto or hurdle over low obstacles. AA3 also streamlined the organization of the fireteams the players were grouped into; the Designated Marksman is now a member of one of the fireteams instead of being a separate two-man shooter/spotter element as would be more fitting of a sniper team as opposed to a Designated Marksman.","June 1, 2013","true","408.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.\n2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).\n\nPrepare the cookie dough layer:\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).\n4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.","May 25, 2015","true","4.0"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","50","8","16","9","0"

Only 2 or 3 servers are populated at any given time (from what I experienced), and an extremely steep learning curve (not that it's a bad thing, I like it).\n\nIf you were to play this game in 2010 or so, it would be great.

Well, it can't, but only because ArmA has got mods, and a large number of active community members helping to make the game better every day.\n\nHowever, for a free game, it is (or WAS) good.\n\nNot recommended, however, as the game is dead as an AIDsbolapox-ridden, decaying carcass.","October 23, 2014","false","12.7"," 25 of 51 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","25","51","0","1"

The purpose of this game is to be a recruiting tool for the US military.  It looks like they took a 90s shooter, strapped on some clunky graphics, gave it a confusing heads up display, and never bothered to work out any bugs with the launcher they have.  I was excited to play at first.  It seemed like a game that could potentially describe a military experience.\n\nWhat I experienced was a "Boot Camp" where I had to read what was being done to my character.  Then when I tried to actually do the missions, it wouldn't let me.  I restarted, and I was able to join the boot camp mission before I crashed.  So I decided to skip boot camp and go onto the missions.  I would spawn, and die a few seconds later.  Sometimes I would die and it wouldn't say why.  I was part of a team completing an objective.  But to what this objective was?  No idea.  And when I asked for help, some dude with a name such as "Die♥♥♥♥♥xFreedomx" would tell me to go back to boot camp.\n\n"Sorry, I tried boot camp, but it either wouldn't let me do it, or would crash out of it."\n\nBut what else can I expect from a recruitment tool?  I can assure you that this game would in no way attract me to the US military, unless I thought "Die♥♥♥♥♥xFreedomx" was a good screename to have.","December 28, 2013","false","0.1"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

If you're a fan of COD (I happen to like COD, Battlefield, and CS), you'll find that the gameplay style here is significantly different.  Yes, there are some players that like to run and gun, but for the most part, this is a game that requires you to move slower and have more patience.  Having a mic for this game is a must, if you want to get the most out of it.\n\nIn AA3, there are no respawns.  You have an objective, which, depending on the game mode, could involve securing points, grabbing a suitcase and bringing it to a point, or escorting a VIP to an extraction point.\n\nAA3 also feels very different than Proving Grounds.  Much more teamwork in this game, far fewer players running around solo and dying in 15 seconds.\n\nPros:\n- It's free.\n- It's team-oriented.  Regular players use VOIP to call out enemy locations, so a team with mics will annilihate a team without them.\n- There is a pretty cool medic system.  Getting shot affects your movement differently if it's in your arm vs in your leg.  You can treat injured teammates, but have to apply the correct treatment.  (Sadly, there are only 4 possible treatments, so ultimately you just have to memorize those 4).\n- If you're not good at twitch shooters and like something more tactical, this is for you.\n\nCons:\n- There are bugs.  You must learn to live with them.\n- There is lag at times, but it's tolerable.  Don't like it?  Try another server.\n- There are essentially only 3 weapons (M4, M16, M249), but you can vary them a bit with different scopes/ammos/loadouts.  They also function differently if you pick them up off a dead enemy.\n- The community is small.  I'd guess there are only a few hundred active players.  Servers tend to fill up between 9pm and 1am EST.\n\nGive it a try... it takes a little time to learn and get good at.  It's free, so why not?","April 7, 2015","true","827.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Clunky, boring, awkward, and ugly. nothing about this game is smooth or intuitive. The UI is horrid, the graphics in-game are barely a step up from games released 8-10 years ago. (BF2 modern combat looked almost as good but was 100 times more fun to play.)\n\nThe AI is absolutely laughable, unable to hit the broadside of a barn from 5 yards away. Of course your Ai buddies are great shots, go go super USA...\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have nothing against the USA or their armed forces, but this game is a wreck. I cannot belive it still is updated and played honestly, but then again, there are thousands of Roblox players still I guess... No accounting for people playing God-awful games.\n\nThe worst part is I think it had potential! Some of the elements are cool, the medic system, while clunky and awkward, is a cool concept. I like the different ways you can interact with your soldiers and such. The whole idea of you being just another soldier in the field is fun, but the execution of this title is incredibly poor.\n\nFix the graphics, redo all the UI elements, make the gameplay much smoother and more intuitive, etc etc... I tried this game years ago and it was unplayable. I decided to give it another try just for fun after discovering that it was still around, sadly, it is nearly as unplayable now as it was the first time.","April 10","false","0.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

It´s one of those rare games where you can actually feel the weight of your character, the recoil of the gun, the inertia of the bullet and other physics-related impression.\nThis creates a lot of immersion, but will make it rather challenging for new players, that haven´t played a (semi-)sim (or "Simcade") recently. However, you will get a very detailed tutorial, which you can play whenever you like (I hate it when a game forces you to play a tutorial, and then you can´t revisit it for the remainder of the game). Very well executed.\n\nThis, together with the above average learning of the control scheme, reminded me a lot of ARMA. The graphics and sounds are both very well made for the time, and they still hold up to todays standards.\n\nNow to the CoD-like aspect. The maps are predominantly medium-sized, maybe think of Array from Black Ops 1. This means you still get to fight at a distance, which is essential for the realistic feel, while you still encounter lots of enemies to be constantly challenged.\nJust as in CoD and BF, you unlock most of the more interesting guns through gameplay, which might be too grindy for casual players, but will keep anyone with a good amount of time on their hands occupied for quite some time.\n\nI like the different game-modes. While they are nothing too innovative, you still have very distinct gameplay differences between the different modes, instead of just "shooting as usual, but stopping to cap a flag occasionally". Every mode actually feels different enough to stay interesting over longer periods of time.\n\nThis game can be played either competitively (everything you play, from the tutorial to the hardcore challenges is timed and objectively scored, so you can literally compete in anything you like with your friends) or rather casually (games are quick to jump in and out of). that´s a plus in my book.\n\nOverall: 8/10, definitely recommended. And a must-have for everyone who enjoys the more convoluted gameplay if ARMA.","June 10, 2015","true","2.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now I know this game is pretty old and i know that there is another one out already i played the other one ( Americas Army Proving Grounds ) which i think is just an ok game ( 6/10 ) they kind of made it less realistic and made it more like a call of duty I guess which is ok but not how americas army was. I liked this game alot so if you want a realistic game thats an fps and  has lots of tactics this is for you, But there is one thing theres not many servers any more probably becuase this game is old and most of the people probably switched to the other one or just shut it down becuase of theres not that many people on any more.","June 14, 2014","true","300.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It  made itself cool in a unique way because it takes a realistic aprouch and puts you in the shoes of a U.S Army soilder and takes you through trainning. I like it because it teaches people very important skills like First Aid, Gun Safety, and other skills that can be used i a life or death situation. Now I was in Boy Scouts so some of the skills I learned I learned again in this game, but that does not mean I didn't enjoy it.\n\nSo in conclusion i HIGHLY recomend people who are looking for a ARMY simulator and urge them to play this one and NOT A point and shoot, no scoping, killing for fun COD game.","November 23, 2014","true","10.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The new proving grounds is like a whole new game and the graphics are way different. Ugly in my opinion. Americas Army 3 on the other hand has a small dedicated following of people. Small is Small too there are typiclly 15 - 20 servers running but only 60 people tops. The community sticks to the well known servers such as 312 or UWS and has a broad spectrum of people from across the globe. At any given moment you have Russians, Americans, French, and Australians, all having a good time killing each other. There is a learning curve if you are new. Best advice is to take the single player training because its integral to the game. A microphone is also recommended in order to communicate with your team more effectivly. This game is about communication and teamwork as much as it is running and shooting.","January 28, 2015","true","174.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's more difficult to charge in head-on to the enemy as your body armor can only take 1-2 shots before being broken and leaving yourself unprotected. The use of cover is one of the many things that will save you when playing this game, and it slows down the pace of the game itself as you have to move from cover to cover, suppress the enemy, deploy smoke, etc.... For a newcomer to America's Army 3, I would recommend going over the training courses before stepping into a pvp match because the controls are a bit complicated. The one thing that I hope would be fixed on here is the introduction of new weapons and a better class system because there are far too many times that every match I go in, people tend to choose the Squad Designated Marksman role and the only ones left are the rifleman, grenadier, and automatic rifleman.","June 22, 2014","true","32.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's more difficult to charge in head-on to the enemy as your body armor can only take 1-2 shots before being broken and leaving yourself unprotected. The use of cover is one of the many things that will save you when playing this game, and it slows down the pace of the game itself as you have to move from cover to cover, suppress the enemy, deploy smoke, etc.... For a newcomer to America's Army 3, I would recommend going over the training courses before stepping into a pvp match because the controls are a bit complicated. The one thing that I hope would be fixed on here is the introduction of new weapons and a better class system because there are far too many times that every match I go in, people tend to choose the Squad Designated Marksman role and the only ones left are the rifleman, grenadier, and automatic rifleman.","June 22, 2014","true","32.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Now I know this game is pretty old and i know that there is another one out already i played the other one ( Americas Army Proving Grounds ) which i think is just an ok game ( 6/10 ) they kind of made it less realistic and made it more like a call of duty I guess which is ok but not how americas army was. I liked this game alot so if you want a realistic game thats an fps and  has lots of tactics this is for you, But there is one thing theres not many servers any more probably becuase this game is old and most of the people probably switched to the other one or just shut it down becuase of theres not that many people on any more.","June 14, 2014","true","300.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I beleive there is a better version of this game from the same company but don't quote me on that. If you want a more realistic free to play FPS then I guess this is the game for you.

The new proving grounds is like a whole new game and the graphics are way different. Ugly in my opinion. Americas Army 3 on the other hand has a small dedicated following of people. Small is Small too there are typiclly 15 - 20 servers running but only 60 people tops. The community sticks to the well known servers such as 312 or UWS and has a broad spectrum of people from across the globe. At any given moment you have Russians, Americans, French, and Australians, all having a good time killing each other. There is a learning curve if you are new. Best advice is to take the single player training because its integral to the game. A microphone is also recommended in order to communicate with your team more effectivly. This game is about communication and teamwork as much as it is running and shooting.","January 28, 2015","true","174.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It may be slightly dated to todays standard, but its still a great ride. Not only was the game free, but it held a unique and outstanding weapon system. The game also kept you immersed and pumped for what ever layed over the hill, or around the next corner. My adrenalin has only gone so far in S.T.A.L.K.E.R and a competitve match on CS:GO, but keep in mind, this game is free.

"it has lots of teamwork"... YEAH RIGHT! I was in two matches where there was a player(s) doing a lot of lone wolfing (one time I was lone wolfing) so... it has the same tactics as many other FPS games, but the Tom Clancy games outrank them all with tactics\n2. "really realistic"... again YEAH RIGHT! IT IS A PC GAME YOU PEOPLE!!!!!! PC GAMES CAN NEVER BE REALLY CLOSE TO REAL LIFE!!!!!!! it has worse graphics than Halo 2 which was made in 2004.  and the final example to back this up: I don't think that running around shooting each other at the same time is realistic.\n3. launching the game... it is SO STINKIN' CONFUSING!!!!!  only games with uplay can compete with how confusing it is and those would still lose.\n4. the trailer is exaggerated... the only things that count in the game that is mentioned in the trailer is presicision and strategy (doesn't take much of it though).\n5. the tutorials... BARELY ANYONE PLAYS THEM!!! the makers actually expect everyone to play them and get an "army" experience. what a stupid way to feel an army experience! if you want one go, watch a movie of it, read a book about it, or just go join the army!\nthe one thing I can recommend about this game is the health regen system.  in order to heal your teamate has to come up to you and patch you up.","July 15, 2014","false","4.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","8"

When I started training and got my M16A4 I realized that shooting for me wasn't going to be easy, mostly because i'm used to Xbox One games like Battlefield 4. But anyways, after I completed Basic Rifleman Training I got used to shooting with a mouse and moving with a keyboard , and soon after completing a few more training missions I started playing online servers. Now, if you want to play online don't go to multi-player>internet>servers. Because you most likely won't see any, instead, exit the game and come back into it; then you'll be able to see dozens of different servers that can have you join them. But now, i'm going to talk about gameplay, you can do all sorts of things like lean left/right and you can empty weapon jams from guns, also to equip a grenade you have to hold G and choose your grenade (I personally like the heavy loadout because it includes two frag grenades and smoke grenades). Now the graphics are bad depending on what game your comparing it to, in this case i'm comparing it to Battlefield 4 since its my all-time favorite FPS. Cars don't explode and you can't drive vehicles, also, the aiming is sometimes difficult and takes some getting used to; and the buildings sometimes look straight but you can't blame the designers most games are like that. I would highly recommend this game because it has excellent gameplay at times and the training is fun. But if you have an Xbox One I would recommend Battlefield 4 or Battlefield Hardline. If you do send me a message my gamertag is: TheGr4te 48. Thanks for reading the review and hope to see you on AA3! We can always use an extra soldier!\n\n\nEDIT: oh and i've realized that some servers are really fun to be in for instance me and my team were pinned down and i went sprinting off to a different area to try and distract the enemy (which is the ultimate sacrifice oh yeah)! and dolphin-dove behind a concrete wall. I then spotted 3 enemy soldiers that were the cause of our team getting nowhere and being pinned for about 10 minutes of the match! Next thing you know i've killed 3 enemy soldiers and my team was congratulating me on my courage and bravery on the battlefield. it's completely true and if you don't believe me come onto a server and do that your bound to do it some time or another; unless, of course, your a coward.... That's my edit just wanted to give you guys an actions report!

That alone should make you run from it. This was a game strictly developed to highlight military life and to give more reason for children to want to join up. Is the military a bad thing? Depends what country you live in. Either way this is not a game for many to play, it's extremely basic and does show some more realistic properities to than most games similar to it. If anything go play Call of Duty or Combat Arms. It's just about the same thing, and at least there you won't be forced to watch propaganda videos that want to indoctrinate you and force feed you crap.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zectbumo/recommended/13140/","zectbumo","Zectbumo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zectbumo/","197 products in account","I tried out AA3, developed by the US Army,  last night to get some ideas for map/mod making in Arma 3 and found that it has some interesting game mechanics that I want to use in Arma 3 if possible.\n\nGame Mechanic #1: One neat thing about AA3 that I might have trouble doing in Arma 3 is that your side always looks like the "good guys" (U.S. Army). So you are always fighting the bad guys no matter what side you pick. How is this possible? Well it's a virtual world, why not take advantage of the fact that you can look different from someone elses eyes.\nNever again will you stop and think, hmm, I see a terrorist but I forget if am I a terrorist or not, should I be shooting right now? Also, your guys have glow sticks on their backs so you can make out a friendly easier in smoke or in the dark. Smart.\n\nGame Mechanic #2: Injuries. You can get injured on your arms, legs, chest, and pelvis. Each injury affects you differently (like Arma). But, you can heal specific parts on your teammates so there is a great sense of teamwork here. There was a time where I fixed a guy's two broken arms and two broken legs and he asks me "uh, you fixed me right? so why can't I get up?" I say, "well, you broke all your limbs and I splinted all your limbs so I guess splints can only take you so far. it makes sense" while his alive but crippled self continues to stare into the ground.\n\nGame Mechanic #3: Neutralizing the enemy. You don't have to kill your enemy, you just need to neutralize him. When you wound an enemy he will drop and stay there alive until either his teammate revives him or you go up to zip tie him. This is cool because it's a race for both teams to get to the wounded. Why not shoot him from a distance and finish the job you ask? This brings me to game mechanic #4.\n\nGame Mechanic #4: Points. If you shoot an enemy while he is down you will lose a good chunk of your hard earned points. Points gives you higher ranks and higher ranking gives you better weapons. You earn points by helping your teammates, capturing the point, neutralizing enemies and sometimes even just for running out there in the crossfire (courage +10 points). You lose points for being dishonorable, and hurting teammates.\n\nIt took me only an hour of bumping around the horrible UI and controls and forms, before I felt like a veteran. I'm sure there is more details to learn but the learning curve hump is short. The graphics are a bit on the weak side (Arma 2ish). The audio a bit exaggerated. The clipping is messed up for smoke and models through doors. All in all I actually had fun with the game. All thanks to our U.S. Army.","January 7, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
