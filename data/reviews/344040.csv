"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Poopdogg/recommended/344040/","Poopdogg","Pomplemoussechan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Poopdogg/","152 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nVoxelized: A game which is seemingly (read heavily) inspired by famous "block builder" Minecraft. The game is currently in it's Early Access stage, and unfortuately shows that the "Early" in early access, means "The beginning."  At the time of writing this review, there seems to be nothing noteworthy about the game.  Here's a little bit of info on gameplay.\n\nThere are two levels right now, however only one of them seems to be accessible: The first level is a typical mountain-esque level. There are blocks all around, and seem to be in a hill/mountain shape. By left-clicking you can remove a block. By right clicking, you can add a block. The game, however, does not tell you that you have to pause the game (With the escape button, also not stated in the game) and select on the left side of your screen a number from 0 to 23 (I've read others have been able to get 25, I myself, cannot.) With the number selected, you will create a different block with your right click. The 24 (or 25?) blocks are mostly unique in color, and a few of them are even unique in design; There's a door frame block, and an invisble glass-looking block. You can explore, create, and delete to your hearts content. However at the moment that's all there is to do.\n\nThe second level, however, has not been able to load for me. From the picture it shows at the level select screen, it seems to be just a plain open field, which might be better for those of you that would like a flat landscape to create your dream block-thingy on.\n\nFor the feature available in the game, they work great. I've had no issues deleting, or creating blocks. The jumping physics seem to work well too. All in all, this might just be a game you should wait until is finished to purchase and play. At the moment, I don't find it worth even what it costs, or even at the coupon price you might have.","July 25, 2015","false","5.3"," 63 of 71 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","63","71","6","0"

I recommend reading the first one, as it gives a clear understanding of the journey that has been this... game (?)Voxelized Alpha  0.4.0 - 0.7.0 Review\nOverviewFor the people not interested in a rant, here is a short version - this is not a game. This is the failed attempt of a hobby project that somehow made it on steam. It is a scam, a rip-off, and the rest of the review will show just how bad it can be and how the developer tries so deviously to make it seem like an eligible "Early Access Title". This isn't early access. This isn't even enough to pitch an idea. This is just a cancer.\n\nThe Pros:There are none :) - I already did the jokes on this in the last review, so read the review linked above if interested. In all seriousness, I cannot think of any one good thing about this game.\nThe Cons:First, a little brief history. The developer realized that the "old" Voxelized was beyond repair, so when he picked up development again, chose to re-write the game. Yep, that happened, as you can read here. So, later he posted this announcement in which he claimed that most of the negative reviews are for an earlier version (one that was scrapped), so I'll give you this, my old review no longer applies. So I will do what a devoted game reviewer who cares about games does, so I wrote this one. That does not, however, change the fact that you did absolutely NOTING to improve the old game, and in some regards even made it worse. Here we go!\n\nShameless Minecraft Clone - I'm not talking about the fact that it's a cube-based world in which you place or remove blocks. Many other games do that and feel unique in their own way. What I'm referring to here is the Main Menu and Options Menu, which are... Minecraft's menu! Same design, same button placement, same funny floating yellow text near the logo. Have you no originality or respect for your craft?\n\nHorrid Graphics Options - Leaving textures aside, this game does not even have a proper engine backing it up. It runs in a window, the only way to run it full screen is by guessing the hotkey F4 (or read his updates on the community page) and then you will discover its... just the same tiny window but upscaled! Everything is still being rendered at some 400x600-ish resolution. Even the text is pixelated close to being unintelligible. No means of adjusting resolution either. Heck, the old version had it! What gives?\n\nThe Map... - Oh god. What can I say about the map?! Well, it's no longer a procedural generated map. It's now just a random map... with preset size... that is between 64 and 512 blocks squared. Yup. It literally takes 10 seconds to go through the whole map. And to make it even better, there are invisible walls on the edge, no way of generating other chunks, NOTHING. Block diversity is down as well.\n\nNo more inventory! - I seriously recommend reading on the inventory system in the earlier version, because at least you had something to read about. Here, the inventory is completely gone. You can pick up blocks, but you can only put down the grass one. That is it...\n\nThe store page description is still bogus. - Take you time to glance at what it says then compare it to this and all the other reviews. It's a knee slapper!\nConclusion / Open LetterAs I've mentioned before. I am not here to insult you, but what you are doing is wrong, it's a scam, and there is no other way to put it. I have nothing against trying to make a game. I support you and your dreams, whatever those may be, but the way you are doing it is wrong. Charging 1.99€ for a few bytes of code unworthy to be even called a prototype is disgraceful. This has no place on steam. Make it free, make a forum and continue development there, with feedback from the community, but pull it off of Steam. You are giving false descriptions under the guise of "it's still Early Access, have patience!" and charging money to unsuspecting gamers. It's borderline illegal! And, no, we won't wait. It's been almost a year. You've made a lousy game, scrapped it, started anew and made it even worse.\n\nAgain, I want to stress that I fully support indie game developers. It's something I aspire to be as well some day. But I cannot stand to see this happening. I hope you understand.\n\nSincerely, Jadarma.\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

Even though it's free, it isn't worth your time.\n\nReview:  Voxelized  is a first-person sandbox game where the current objective is... nothing. Upon starting the game, the starting menu is almost exactly the same as Minecraft's, even including the quirky slogan. After you have finished creating a new world, you are spawned in a random location. The enviroment is pretty much flat with a few hills here and there, and the occasional tree in the distance. The graphical style of the game is acceptable, however it has a striking resemblance to the OCD texture pack for Minecraft.The only feature of this game that is playable is that you can build structures, but only with what you can find in the enviroment around you. There is no menu from where you can select materials to build with, you have to right-click on a block so that it is copied to your inventory bar. However building is an incredibly slow process compared to Minecraft.\n\nAudio is very, very annoying as at first it's this long, continous beep that is then accompanied by a drum and what sounds like a fly. This is the only song in the entire game and continues on a constant loop. After 10 minutes of exploration the game suddenly crashed, leaving me with a white screen and the music still playing in the background. I had to manually turn off my PC as even Ctrl + Alt + Delete didn't work.\n\nBefore the game was free, you would get card drops for playing the game. But as the game is now free, you will either have to buy them from the market or craft a booster pack. The badges, emoticons and backgrounds are nothing special, there are far better ones out there.\n\nOverall, this game had a great concept, but unfortunately was unable to pull it off. There is no reedeming features for this game currently, and from the lack of updates, I doubt there will be.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","April 30","false","3.5"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","37","41","9","1"

After an announcement that beta would be released, 3 months has passed. Develepor seems to be gone. So i Beg you, do not support this game anymore)\n\nFirst off all: As it is a build and explore game, you don't have to expect shooting and survival.\nSecondly, it is still early acces.\n\nSo i played, explored and build. But at this point the world is empty. They're some trees and grass. No living things. It feels so dead. Even with the changing between night and day, the storms, it doesn't improve.\nBuilding is at this moment very limited. With around 9 block (including doors and windows). Yes you can build, and it works fine. But it doesn't help my imagination. A house is just a building, empty as can be. It just isn't complete.\n\nI know there is a lot of potential. But it is too early yet. Wait after the next few upgrades. NPC's will be coming your way. more blocks. interactions.\nAnd if it really focusses on building a world, and getting occupants in what you build, it will be different then other block-games.\n\nSo my advice: at this moment not recommended, so don't buy it unless you want to participate in making it a great game. And adding suggestions about it.\nOtherwise wait and give it some time to develop. It is not a bad game, just lacking content. What do you expect in early-acces.

Some are pretty good, some are pretty bad. Some are shooter based, some RPG based and others are survival based. Voxelized, on the other hand, casts all these things aside and focuses solely on the building part, which obviously was one of the main reasons why Minecraft became so popular.\n\nAside from walking around there are two things you can do in Voxelized (at the moment): remove blocks (leftmouse) and add blocks (rightmouse). In the time I was playing I was not able to add blocks, so I tried to check the controls in the option menu to see if I was doing something wrong. Apparently, you can not change the controls in the menu, in fact it even says "Still Under Construction". In my opinion, Early Access or not, something like a game menu should work.\n\nRight now, Voxelized has rain and snow, which is nice but the game only comes with just a different blocks/textures, so you will probably get bored with it quickly.\n\nBeing in Early Access, Voxelized might still improve and the developer seems to listen to the players but even if the developer adds all these things like; animals, weapons and multiplayer support, you just get another Minecraft.\n","June 16, 2015","false","7.7"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","31","38","7","0"

I have no idea if there's a team behind this game or it's just one person.  But I'm going to compare this game to Viscera Cleanup Detail, a game that I purchased in Early Access and was pleased with throughout the entire process.\n\nThis game, Voxelized, is apparently in Beta 0.9.6.  It is, despite what the developer may want you to believe, a Minecraft clone for Steam.  And, from what I've seen of Minecraft, this is a very-dumbed-down version.  VCD had more content available when it was in Alpha 0.5 than this game does with Beta 0.9.6\n\nI don't own the actual Minecraft game.  My interest in owning Minecraft peaks and vallies on a regular basis.  I babysit a tyke who plays it, and I watch her, and I enjoy watching her create and build things.  Of course, I'm also taking child development classes, so watching a child think and create is rewarding in and of itself.\n\nI have a feeling she'd hate Voxelized.\n\nVoxelized is a fascinating concept in and of itself, but there is much work to be done before I'd consider playing this any longer than the ten-minutes-shy-of-an-hour I already have.

I will try and do a full review should this game ever leave Early Access.[www.the-backlog.net]\n\nMinecraft was a runaway hit, and since then many have tried to copy it. Voxelized is no different. After a rocky start, including 5+ months of no updates (despite a promise of "Beta in 2-3 weeks"), the game has finally started to see some updates. I played some of the game back when it was in "alpha", and I decided to come return to it with it in "beta".  What I found was a revamped game... but it's still not much better.\n\nVoxelized's screen is extremely small, and it doesn't play well at all with the Steam Overlay. The screens you're shown are pretty much Minecraft (including one of the default splashes saying Not Minecraft). The world creation is an extremely stripped down version of Minecraft, and you can crash the game if you make it too large. When you enter the world, you're plopped into the very corner. You can enable flying mode to get above the sky box, or dig down to see the moon/sun as it goes below the world.\n\nWhile in the alpha version, the most fun I could find was just going for an infinite loop with falling. The beta version provided even more fun - you can use dynamite to flat out break the game. Should you place it too close to the bottom, things start getting buggy. Place it (and explode it) on the very bottom layer? Things really start to break. (I have a video of this in my full article).\n\nVoxelized is looking very promising at being a bad Minecraft. My suggestion is to just play one of those many other Minecraft clones out there (or just Minecraft itself) and just pass on Voxelized.","November 23, 2015","false","3.1"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","75","30","40","6","1"

And the raindrop simulation is gone, thanks to bedrock; If you played it in the earlier versions then you would know what I mean by that.\n\n10/10, great downgrade simulator.\n\nEDIT! 0.9.4. review!\nOkay, so it seems that the game has been updated, so I gave it another shot.\nAnd what do ya know, it has gotten even worse.\nEvery time I tried to start a world, the game crashes at a specific point in loading. Unlike the previous version that was pretty much the first version of minecraft with trees, the game doesn't even finish loading now! I didn't think it could get worse from the last version, but I was proven wrong.\n\nGreat job, Lord Kres, you are down there with E.T. for the atari. Atleast E.T.'s dev actually tried.","November 12, 2015","false","0.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","3"

It is this gamer's opinion that him labeling Voxelized as Early Access is nothing more than a loop whole to scam more players. There is very little proof that Lord Kres ever plans (or had ever planned) to finish this bad minecraft rippoff. Buying this game further supports a confirmed scammer. Please think twice.\n\n\n-Origanal Post-\nAs you can tell just from the preview video, this is a basic Minecraft clone. It is cheaper of course, as clones should be, but it fails to even come close to being a proper clone. Now this might easily be from the fact that it is in early access. However, at the current stage the game is in, anyone who is thinking about buying this game when Voxelized is not substantially discounted will end up regretting their decision.\n\nHere's a more detailed breakdown:\n\nPros-\nCheaper Minecraft\nBetter initial graphics than vinilla Minecraft\nPotential to become better. (Possibly even be involved in making it better)\nTrading Cards\n\nCons-\nMost texture packs for Minecraft offer better graphic improvements than Voxelized\nLimited content that includes:\nNo inventory at the time of my review\nNo fluid dynamics\nNo explorable caves\nNo Monsters\nOnly three type of diggable materials that I could find (Not including vegetation)","July 28, 2015","false","3.0"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

It is, frankly, amazing that they are accepting money for it at this stage of development. Luckily I didn't have to pay money for what looks to be a tech demo as I got my key from a Greenlight promotion run by the dev, but you should not by any means pay money for this until some actual game arrives.\n\nThe first thing I do when I start a game is try to go to the options menu. This game doesn't even have one (it has a button, but it's grayed out, along with several other features). Once you get into the game things only go downhill. In a block building game, the first thing you're going to want to do is mess around and build some blocks, right? The inventory is apparently still a work in progress too because it's just a list of buttons on the left side of the screen that can only be accessed while the game is paused; not to mention they're all default Unity buttons, something I haven't seen Air Control. Air Control! After figuring out how to get a block in my hand (figuratively, because of course there's no block nor hand) my first mission was to build a tower and see how high I could get. This simple task proved impossible. In games like Minecraft you can jump while facing down, place a block, land, and repeat to gain height quickly. In this game, trying this tactic is a fool's errand. The game will randomly decide to bounce you into the stratosphere, usually straight up but not always, and after falling from a fairly significant height (and many other smaller ones along the way) I decided I didn't want to go through the struggle of trying to get back up and gave up, shut down the game, and came to write this review.\n\nThere are other technical details I could pick on like the awful music (at least they do provide separate volume sliders for everything, which is a positive) or that it's uglier than Minecraft, but really what it comes down to is that there's precious little game there right now, and what is there doesn't work very well. You've got a handful of block types with an inventory that is as slow and tedious as the molasses-like movement system, and...well, that's it really. The state of development is similar to Minecraft's indev, or even earlier.

The video isn't the best but it is.. kinda all there is to the game right now.\n\nWhen you log in, read the green words below the language option screen or you'll have to go back and relaunch the game the read the commands. (see update below}The option bar isn't working right now, I feel this will eventually allow for key-binds and volume prior to launching a map. As of right now you need to launch a map to get the volume controls. I hope the controls for this game get moved to the options soon, even if you cannot rebind them yet so you can look at them without relaunching the game if you miss them on launch. Same with the volume, I'd love to be able to change volume both in and out of the maps.\n\nYou jump like a spaceman on the moon, it's quite funny but a bit annoying when you just need to jump a tiny bit and have to wait to float back to Earth. There are only two maps, which is fine for a new launch EA game. I have not been able to reacess my saved game once I leave, when I relaunch the map it spawns an all new map for me to start over again.\n\nYou get everything you need without doing a thing, just pick 1-9 (and place them in order on the ground so you know which item is to which key) and hit RMB to place them. There isn't a hotbar yet, so you have no way of knowing your items without doing this prior to building.\n\nThere isn't much right now, but as this updates I'll be updating this review. Right now, yes it's fun.. but not for that long. At least for me, but if it keeps going and adds content like; water, animals and mobs to survive against it'll be nice and fun.\n\nThe price tag of under $4 is nice and when they add a bit more to the game I feel it'll be worth the cost but as of now I can't say it's worth it.\n\nIf you like building and just going around doing that without any limits, then yes you'll love this game but for me I need just a bit more. I'm still messing around with this game and if something comes along to make me feel different I'll edit this review.\n\nThank you.\n\n--------\nThere was a day 1 patch for save game, aside from the volume levels not staying where I'd set them the save game works now. Jumping is more resonable.\n\nIf they keep this up it'll be a good game.\n\nIf you can handle an EA (Early Acess) game, and feel like this will keep going in promised direction I say buy it but if you're wanting a game with depth right away... wait to buy, still isn't worth it.\n\n---------\nAs promised I'm updating with patches.\n\nYou can now see the commands when you pause your game in game now, tis nice :D","March 19, 2015","false","0.9"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","0"

The music is madness inducing, non of the basic mechanics you would expect in a game like this are present, just procedural generation of a very limited amount of blocks that you can flat out delete with a mouse click, I didnt figure out how to create blocks out of thin air , nor that I felt like I wanted to either. Nothing to do nothing to see here. This is junkware that clutters your library, and is a testament to the lack of quality control going around on steam, whom, are happy to allow fake games to be sold so they can have their ridiculous trading card economy.

It takes all of 3 literal seconds to walk across it either lengthwise or widthwise.\n-There is no way to check your inventory to see what blocks you've picked up or how many you have.\n-Even if you could it doesn't matter, because you can't place the blocks you pick up. For all intents and purposes, they wink out of existence the second you pick them up.\n-Even if the blocks didn't wink out of existence, there is no reason to pick up any blocks (aside from terraforming), because the blocks you place and the blocks you pick up are entirely different. You don't have to pick up a thing in order to start building.\n-There is no way to expand the small square of land to build on. Digging down a few blocks you hit upon an unminable layer. There are invisible walls around the sides of the map, so you can't make a block bridge to go out. As far as I tested there is no limitations on upward construction.\n\nAs it stands I cannot in recommend the game in the current state that it is in. Even disregarding the fiasco of every other game and greenlight that has come from this dev, and focusing solely on the game as it is right now at this point in time. Once a bit more work goes into it I would be willing to recommend this game (something I never thought I would say, but inspite of [or perhaps because of?] everything that has happened in connection to this dev in the past, I gotta say I'm starting to get the impression he really is trying. I believe in forgiveness, even if I don't forget the reason why forgiveness was needed in the first place.).\n*********************************************************************************************************************\nREVISIONS:\n~ESC now pauses the game and brings up a menu.\n~There is now an option when you start the game to create a new game world, in varying sizes (I have not tested this feature extensively, but at the lowest world size it loads fairly quickly)\n~Start menu and pause menu now feel a bit more polished (not fully explored yet, as time permits I will explore more)","November 11, 2015","false","2.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

(under the ground)\n\nIf you make a high tower, then go down to the bottom, break the 2 block at the bottom, then go under the tower and placing a block inside yourself, then you will get transported all the way to the top of the tower.\n\nIf you want ideas to things you can make for next update, i would probably add better terrain, like hills, seas, bushes and stuff like that. Tools, food and health could also be great. You can still find other things to add from the old review.\n\nWOULD I RECOMMEND IT?: Well, its much better than before, but as it is right now, i don't really think it is a game you can play for hours. There is 13 placeable blocks, and there isn't anything survival over it.\n\nI think this game will become much better, and i will keep updating this review as newer updates come. Just be patient, and wait. :D\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW:\n\nLooking up and down is way too slow.\nMake choosing blocks easier.\nMake survival mode.\nPlease do so you don't break blocks instantly.\nAllow cheats like infinite blocks, fly mode, instant block breaking, if survival gets here.\nA few more achievements could be great.\nMake jumping feel more realistic.\nRandom terrain generation.\nMake max fps something you can change.\nMultiplayer.\nmake the game moddable.\nTools, food, weapons, plants, animals & enemies should be added.\nfences, traps things to protect your building.\nChests, bags, crates, or something to store items in.\nGet better sounds for breaking and placing blocks.\nDungeons, or places to explore could be awesome.\nFarming.\nMake health, and stamina.\nElectricity.

There are only numbers, accesible from the menu, which allow you to choose them (as I figured out later) and then place.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nOne of the worst Minecraft clones with afwul, eye-hurting graphics and broken mechanics.

It's basically just Minecraft's creative mode without any of the unique blocks or infinite worlds. You're just wandering one of four pre-made maps and placing and removing blocks. Also, if you're playing in windowed mode, your mouse will constantly exit the window.\n\nThe most fun I had playing this was digging into the core of the earth and falling from the sky. It was mildly amusing.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThe game got an update and the developer is warning people that old reviews may not be accurate, so I decided to update my review as well. The gameplay is unchanged, but they added a few new blocks. All but one of them behave the same, but one block they added was TNT. Although Minecraft already has this, it is cool to see in this game as well. They also fixed the problem with the mouse curser leaving the screen. Oddly, they removed three out of four of the maps and eliminated the ability to drill down into the core of the earth.\n\nOverall, the game is improving.

I reccommend just getting GTGD S1 instead (you don't even have to code the game if you don't want to learn, you can just build the example source code project into a runnable game) and making a better game in this genre (actually has some FPS elements in the tutorial game you build) the way YOU want, instead of some nebulous "community" suggestions that may or may not come later in this game.\n\nUpdate:\nAs expected, it turns out the "dev" was in fact a scammer trying to make quick money by releasing essentially fake games on Steam.","April 24, 2015","false","0.8"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","27","47","2","0"

There is nothing to do.  You can walk around amongst five different coloured voxels that make Minecraft look beautiful.  You can break them, and... that's it.  There's some ability to kind of place blocks, but there's no inventory or anything, and it seems when you right click, random thnigs just start appearing.\n\nI understand this is Early Access, but the problem I have with it is that it says "The game in it´s current state is fully playable and the features still in development do not affect to the gameplay."  There is no gameplay, that is a lie.\n\nAlso, this developer has released another title that claims to have eight chapters worth of content, yet no one can beat the first chapter.  People have combed through the code and say there are not even additional chapters programmed.  It would appear this person is a scammer, and somehow I doubt this project will ever leave Early Access.\n\nPlease see the below Imgur album if you are interested in the evidence that his other game is an unbeatable scam.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/a/yceJt\n\nIn summary, this game is so terrible that it took 0.1 hours for me to decide that I want my $0.09 back badly enough that I will go through the Steam refund process for it and lose money on not collecting $0.18 worth of cards, just to deprive this awful developer of less than a dime.","July 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Nevertheless i like the game alot and i'd be interested in seeing how it develops in the Months to come. If there's another thing i've got to criticize about the game is the lack of features, Basic things like changing Settings and a fully functional Main Menu are things i'd expect from a game as early in development as this one is. Also; The lack of things to build with; Since the game heavily encourages creative minds only having 8 things to build with is severely distrusting especially when i dumped $4 of my hard earned work money into it.\nWhile i don't necessarily like to give negative reviews since the Developer wants Honest ones i gave him mine as Honest as i can make it.\n\nI'm sorry, But i just don't think its complete enough for me to recommend it at all.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketsurgery/recommended/344040/","rocketsurgery","rocketsurgeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketsurgery/","3787 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis rather pathetic tech demo/test program passing greenlight and being for sale in the actual Steam store clearly exemplifies just how broken Steam is at the moment.\n\nThe price, without discounts, of this... thing is €3.99 in the EU1 store, but there is nothing here. Sure, you can move around in the world and you can remove and add some blocks, but that is pretty much it. We can go all metaphysical and ask "what is a game?", but I'm afraid that just about any way you ask that question, the answer is "something that isn't Voxelized".\n\nNow, the developer seems to be saying that he wants the community around his... creation to shape it, and let him know in what direction to take it, but that is disingenuous, at best. To me, that is him basically saying that he's completely devoid of any ideas or ambitions of his own, and he wants the "community" to design his game for him, and that would be... you know... pretty bad. I wish I could come up with some other explanation, but seeing as how he's provided no framework and presented no design or plan of his own for what Voxelized is supposed to become, it becomes clear that this really is something considerably less than just a very early alpha of a game.\n\nIt truly is no more than a simple test program, that, through the massive faults of the Steam Greenlight process and Steam vetting of what is offered up for sale in the store, has been elevated to a for-sale product. And no amount of labeling as "Early Access" can change the fact that this... thing, has no business whatsoever being for sale to unsuspecting customers.\n\nHell, if he wanted feedback, then perhaps a Greenlight page would have been a good place to get it, but instead, this developer has broken new ground - instead of letting your paying customers just be your QA, he's asking them to also be the design team. I strongly suspect that the only reason he's not making them also be the development team, is that he lacks the programming chops to build the scaffolding needed around his... product to allow it to be modded.","April 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/recommended/344040/","tejan","Tejan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tejan/","450 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI thought that this might be a slightly bad Minecraft clone that, for 9 cents, I could get some fun out of. Little did I know that this is probably one of the worst games I've ever seen on Steam.\nNow, I've bought plenty of what I like to call "indie bargain bin" games on Steam, which are games that cost a few cents and you can sell their trading cards for a profit, and not once have I ever thought to myself that I actually would have been better off just buying a cosmetic for Dota, until now.\n\nThe game is just plain broken. Not even early access needs content broken, just downright broke. My first impression of the game came from intro screen that looked like your generic Unity interface you learn from any tutorial and had to choose one of 4 modes, there's no difference besides one being flat. The weirdly slow walk speed when I started, I thought it was weird, but kept on going. Then I broke a few blocks and attempted to place some to find out I couldn't. I found out you could place blocks but to change colors you need to press esc and click on these buttons that are allows present that are numbered 1-24, you can only click them while in the esc pause menu though. Each button corresponds to a block color, but they're labeled as numbers so you need to try them all to get the color you want.\nI don't think I can accurately describe how bad the game is, but basically imagine the first ever build of Minecraft, but make the game about 20 times more janky.\n\n\nTL;DR: A terrible Minecraft clone that hoped to get you to buy it because Minecraft isn't on Steam. With the advent of Steam refunds I hope developers of scams like this have to stop developing games like this.","July 30, 2015","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I'll be blunt: This game is a really crappy minecraft clone with terrible...well everything. Music is mediocre, animation is non-existent, gameplay is horrific (really crappy inventory screen and it's confusing as hell to figure out how to select a building block), etc. In addition to that, those that may pick up this game for the one tempting, seemingly simple achievement should also stay away. That achievement is broken beyond hell (in the sense that it's nonexistent) and there isn't even any code for an achievement in the source files. Only reason that this piece of crap has so much gametime on my profile is because I alt-tabbed for trading cards. Hopefully brain-dead fools that actually want the badge can help me get my money back.\n\ntl;dr: instead of paying 9 cents for a game that is literally there to leave a blemish on your steam library, shell out the $26 to buy minecraft instead. You'll get a hell of a lot more for what you spent.\n\nIf I hear that this game gets any better during the early access period, then maybe I'll change my review.

Currently it is really bare, even by Early Access standards imo. There are tons of other open world voxel building games out there, and I can't even see the potential for this one right now\nThe interface is poorly designed at the moment, with you having to press escape to pause the game and select a block each time you want to place a different block. What you select are numbers that correspond to a block, with no preview of the actual block, making the process more tedious. Like I said, there are a ton of other voxel block building games out there that have done this much better, most of them have a system where you drag blocks to assign to your number keys. The fact that this simple tried and trusted method for selecting and placing blocks that has been done over hundreds of times is absent from the game really shows how early in development this is.\nThe blocks for now are mostly just different colours of a simple cube. They are all pretty useless at the moment\nThere is currently no physics implemented, other than the player falling due to gravity, and no multiplayer\nIt is also worth mentioning that the developers have also made Journey Of The Light, another game with poor user review scores\nThere needs to be much more before I can recommend buying the game for any reason other than profiting from the trading cards when it's on 90% off sale. Currently, it looks like a lazy cash grab.\nRather get Unturned or Trove, which are free.","July 31, 2015","false","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Imagine Minecraft Classic (the version where you had a set inventory of placeable blocks) and no ability to fly, and you basically have Voxelized. No animals, changing environments, mobs, or really anything are included in this game. For something that came out in March, this isn't even early-access worthy, more like a Jr. High Schooler's computer project.\n\nIf there's any saving grace to this game, it's the fact that it does actually run. There is a selection of blocks to pick from, they can be placed, and what's there, though there's very little, does seem to function.\n\nI suspect a toddler or anyone under the age of 3 might be able to get some enjoyment out of this, if only for its rated "N" for "Nothing" nature and the fact that there are some pretty colors. If you are over the age of 3, I'd suggest a pass.","October 20, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My original review can still be found at the bottom. Here are some things I saw after the update:\n\nImprovements:\nThe textures look much better.\nBlocks can be selected by scrolling the mouse will.\nSelected block is shown in the lower left of the screen.\nThere are a few more block types.\nFly mode was added.\n\nThings that could still be improved:\nFlowers have collisions enabled so you can't walk through them.\nStill no enemies to give the player a reason to do the things they are doing.\nThe player can only jump about 1 block high which makes it difficult to jump up a level.\n\nAll in all, this version of Voxelized is an improvement. However, I still can't recommend buying it.\n\n\n[Original Review] - Pre November 2015\n\nThis should not be called an Alpha release. Even calling it a concept test at this stage is premature. The game is in such an early state, there is NOTHING to do. You can walk, jump and "POP" blocks (I say pop because of the sound it makes when you break anything) and that's it. The controls say you can place blocks by right clicking but nothing happens.\n\nThere is a grand total of 5 block types: all gray, all brown, half brown half green, all green and a white block with black lines on it representing what I suppose is a birch wood. When blocks are broken, they just disappear.\n\nThe truth is, I am really having a hard time calling this a game.\n\n[Edit] - I figured out how to place blocks. The numbers 0 - 25 are in a column on the left of the screen. If you click one (other than the number 0) you will be able to place a block of the selected number. While a terrible design, I still think I should revise my review. There are actually 25 different blocks, not 5, that the player can build with. Does this in any way redeem the game? NO!","July 31, 2015","false","12.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just wanted to build a photorealistic depiction of the male genitalia, but I was soon disappointed. I'm Rick Lancer, and this is my Voxelized story:\n\nIt was the 27th of August, in the year 2015. At around 22:50, I received a gift in my Steam inventory: a new game! Excitement filled my loins as I quickly installed the game, my palms sweaty and my knees heavy. My excitement was short-lived, however, as I discovered that this game was utter garbage.\n\nI attempted to rid my tympanic membranes of this horrific soundtrack contained within the game, but alas, the volume sliders do not work. I was stuck with the sound of a $5 piano and a sine wave playing in the lower frequencies resonating within my cranium. The sound waves travelled into a USB cable, into my DAC. They zoomed into a pair of RCA cables into my amp, and then, now stronger than ever, travelled through the cable connecting my headphones to the afformentioned amplifier. It was from there that they pierced my brain, making me feel thoughts I had never felt before.\n\nI had to press on. I had a goal in my mind. I had to create a flawless set of testes and the proudest, most erect ♥♥♥♥♥ to ever grace anybody's ocular orbs. I opened my inventory...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n...this game has no inventory. You can build with blocks of dirt, and nothing else.

That's it.\nOn the launcher you can customize your resolution, change graphics, and bind keys. Keep in mind that there is only one option: Ultra High. At the main menu you have 6 buttons: Play, Multiplayer, Options, Credits, Quit and Languages. Multiplayer and Play are both inaccessable at the moment, though. You would think that at the least you would be able to access an options menu where you would be able to change something like resolution or audio settings, but the game doesn't even have that. One it does have, though, is a slider for music on the main menu. That doesn't work. But it plays music anyway.\nWhen you click "Play," it changes to a screen with 4 world options: A normal world, a flat world, a hardcore world, and a "bonus world". The last two don't work, so I went with the normal world. Now that I was in the actual game, I clicked Escape, hoping I would be able to access some sort of settings or inventory. What I got was a list of controls, some audio sliders and a "climb up blocks" slider. You heard me right, a slider to toggle between two options. If there's any praise I have for this game, it's about the audio sliders for different things like music, building sounds, and birds chirping, which can't be said for lots of modern triple A games.\nWhat I didn't notice however, was an inventory. The game has none. From my understanding, you can only place the last block that you left clicked on, and you have an infinite number of that block. Weird.\nObviously since this game literally has no content, I started to dig down. But once I got to some red tiles underground, I fell through the bottom of the world and found myself falling from the sky onto the surface of the world again. Trippy.\nThis uninspired, incomplete game has absolutely no future or potential at all. It's not fun, and never will be. It's not even worth buying for a profit off the trading cards, you have better things to do with your time than play this.","July 28, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

A Minecraft-style game, basically build and explore. At the moment though, it's very... Lacking. I only have minimum playtime as mouse sensitivity made it nearly unplayable.\n\nPro's:The performance is great.\nThe day and night cycles as well as the weather effects could be brilliant when cleaned up.\nA choice of a few languages before you get in to the actual game.\nA few maps to choose from and explore.\nCon's:Mouse sensitivity is horrendous, makes the game hardly playable.\nLack of building block choices. You're stuck with 9 blocks which leads to a very bland house.\nSome textures need to be polished up.\nMusic and sounds are a bit out of place.\nVery basic map terrain. Hills or flatland.\nNo 'Option' menu as of yet.\n'Creative' mode only.\nOverall lack of content.\nLike I said before, the game is promising. With more content promised the game could turn out extremely awesome but in it's current state I could not recommend buying it unless to support the developer, as it's quite possibly unplayable past an hour, if you can get over the sensitivity issues.

I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because\nthis game gave me cancer anyway.","February 9","false","0.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

There is little to actually do as most of the gameplay appears to not have been added yet. The textures of the blocks are (hopefully) provisionary with super simplistic characteristics lacking any substantial depth to them. The music of the game appears to be on a loop with the most memorable tone being "doot doot, doot doot doot". Windowed mode does not lock your mouse cursor to the window and can cause issues while breaking blocks or building.\n\nI personally believe that this game is another Minecraft clone however for 9 cents I was honestly surprised that it ran relatively decently and had a day/night cycle. Voxelized needs alot of work to actually be sustainably enjoyable in my opinion and features such as multiplayer need to be incorporated as well, which would help in going down that route by a large margin.\n\nOverall I would recommend grabbing a copy of this game for super cheap and keeping an eye on it. Given enough time Voxelized may become something "completely different".","July 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","1"

(you can use ninja techniques but a fork or large spoon also works )\nWhen the pancake is cooked in both sides, remove it from the pan and now you can put everything you want on it or eat it simple.\n\nNote: you can add other ingredients to mixture like bacon, fruits, cereals...

There is sound, nothing more to say about that. The gameplay consists of basically nothing but building, and making "your own adventure".\n\nI do not recommend this game to anyone.
