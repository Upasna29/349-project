(Thanks for the gift, ValkyrieMoon!)\nTruth to be told, I wanted to talk about the game's story first, but an important thing for future buyers:  THIS IS NOT AN RPG. Each and every items strictly has it's usage, the story is straightforward, there is no choicemaking. This game is a point and click - pretty good at it, but I wanted to make this clear - no fighting in the game, or quests, or whatsoever.\n\nI think the developer(s?) liked Firefly, at least I felt some resemblances to the series both in some minor elements, and the overall atmosphere of the game  - it has a serious, normal story, but quote often something funny or unexpected pops up - " my longest serving companion" is a plant, there's the lampiest lamp of the room, something silly. Like the captain gets bored during flights and start being a little crazy.\nThe story felt like a random episode of a sci-fi show - short, somewhat cliché, but likeable, while I wasn't hyped about what will happen next, I played through the game without getting bored at all, that's a good sign. I perticularly loved the robots in the third chapter - they mixed up the themes of Asimov's robotics with some feeling, existential of robots and humans - it was really intresting, that was the best written part of the game in my opinion.\nAbout language and music... others mentioned typos, I don't recall any. Others mentioned good music, while usually I felt that the game's music was really underwhelming, usually I haven't even noticed it.  Or maybe the sounds effects were louder than the music and I turned down the volume... I think that this doesn't matter that much. The game is a good way to pass an hour if you want nothing more than a dose of sci-fi episode of a series you like - I'll keep an eye on the next episodes, hope they'll fare well.","December 31, 2015","true","6.4"," 70 of 74 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","70","74","3","4"

Exactly what it said on the tin. A narrative game built on an RPG engine with no combat, no branching, and simple puzzles.\n\nI'm still recommending it. Accepting that it's short and linear, the writing was uncommonly decent. I've played a lot of big-budget games with incomprehensible stories and inane dialogue. Even though this was a very straightforward science fiction story, it was well done in comparison.","December 21, 2015","true","0.9"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","37","40","5","0"

This time, she has three persons: a retired colonel, a clever scientist and a crazy Russian priest that is reciting passages from the Bible. However, nearing the end of the journey, someone took the commands of the ship... How will Gail regain the control and save her passengers? And why people at Innes Station where she's docking because of an emergency are behaving weirdly too?\n\nThis little adventure game was made with RPG Maker, true, so, the style and the HUD is known. But the story is well-written: you go from twist to twist, you're playing two characters actually (Gail then someone else in act III) and you have some good humor in it (Gail is maybe a good girl but she's not really confident in herself).\n\nThe gameplay is easy: you search for items, you discuss with people and nope, you don't have any hidden object scenes - because usually that kind of beginning for the sentence is often found in my review about HOG. Anyway, you can combine items in your inventory when needed. Keep in mind that sometimes, you need to go to the inventory and examine more closely items in order to advance in the game - I was kinda stuck twice because I didn't think about this action.\n\nThe soundtrack is also a good one. I loved the fact that you can activate the intercom to play music and to enable finally something to listen instead of the void.\n\nSeriously, for the price, you have a little good moment to enjoy. True, it's short - you can complete the game in 1 hour. However, I'm looking forward to the other episodes (I've the second one in my library and at the time of the writing, the third one is in my wishlist).

Mark this one down as one of the good RPG Maker titles on Steam. The story was cool. Sort of reminiscent of a 1950's sci-fi mystery. It's pretty standard point and click, combine items or sequences to solve puzzles fare. Nothing too challenging at all, but that's actually good as it doesn't step on the game by making the puzzles too complicated. This is meant to be a more casual and enjoyable introduction to the series from what I can tell and it succeeds.\n\nAs far as all video games go, I'd probably rate this as a 6 out of 10, but when taking account it being an RPG Maker title, I give it a boost to about 7.5 out of 10. Plus, it is (at the time of this writing) 49 cents on Steam, and there is a good chance that you already have this in your library, but if not, I would recommend giving it your attention.","February 8","true","5.3"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","1"

Its 2 developers that bring 2 games out now in last month and i can only hope the other game is nearly of this quality. So what the most will critic will be the length, i stuck 1 time badly in mid game where to use the keys because their are no hints and i search at the wrong places but some could do it under 1 hour or even very less, but for that it has more intensity then other stupid hack n slay, level rpgs or others. So decide your price you want to pay and support this great developer team or buy another game. Think very well about it and dont blame the developer with a bad review only because you buy the wrong game.

Every character is a one-note stereotype, the environments are stark, dull and tiny, and the pacing is so non-existant you'll probably be half asleep when there's literally a space shoot-out with a bishop  (less interesting than it sounds!)\nHonestly the main issue with the game is that the author's so engrossed in telling... whatever story this is, that he kinda forgot any worldbuilding details or any reason to care about any of the characters. This kinda makes the whole experience quite underwhelming - having the opening scene start with the main character cry out 'HELLO I AM GAIL PILGRIM ARE YOU MY PASSENGER' to 6 people or so is not interesting or engrossing.\nThe setting art is nice though, even if everything else is cribbed from stock tilesets and VX's portrait generator.","December 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 21 of 32 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","21","32","2","3"

You can tell they tried to make the game engaging, and not a boring fetch quest repetitive game.\nThere is complete mouse support, which is great because there are also alot of things to interact with.\nThe inventory could really use some work, such as making item merging more highlighted during crafting, (I had to click guess my way through item customization first time, but it was easy after the initial guess work.)\nThere is a journal, which I found useful as a reference point, (noticed some lag switching between journal tabs.)\n\nThe music is immersive, with a nice Mass Effect type feeling, although slightly more retro sounding.\nThe writing is quite solid and humorous at times too, however there were a few spelling errors and points that made me think, "Now why would a character say/do that?"\nI forsee the writing being just as good and better throughout the next episodes, and their future work.\nThe writing quality ties in with characters and character interaction; the characters are pretty cliched, but not in a bad way. You can have several conversations for minor character developement.\nThere are a few amusing one liners and situations the characters get themselves into.\nI enjoyed the pacing of the story. A few times I found myself interested enough to be guessing what happens next, who is who, what looks suspicious and so on, which means I was engaged, contrary to my first assumptions about an RPG Maker style episodic game, which usually makes many people iffy to want to invest in.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my experience playing this first episode and was grinning as the game transitioned to the credits.\nIf I were to describe this, I would compare it to watching an episode of Firefly; the episode has its introduction, then problems arise, then the characters aim is to fix those problems or mysteries and it all interestingly unfolds infront of your eyes. By the end of the acts, and the episode, things are wrapped up, leaving you wondering what mysteries and problems will happen next episode.\n\nThanks for a decently designed, written and enjoyable game.\n- Nerf","December 23, 2015","true","5.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

I don't want that to get lost when I don't recommend the game.\n\nThe premise was interesting and on sale for $0.50, how could I not check it out? Based on how things start, I was ready for a good little horror game. It'd be like Alien; stuck on a ship with an unknown threat. The developer is great at setting up atmosphere. The music was perfect and the characters set a good tone. Thumbs up on having me turn down the lights. Unfortunately, there was no real payoff and it ended very anticlimactically. The gameplay is very simple as you just do one task after the other. It's just a matter of finding the right thing to interact with. The characters are not that interesting. One is crazy, one is nice, and the other one is "Jerk Spock". Two of them do have a little philosophical argument that was interesting, but it never goes anywhere, unfortunately.\n\nThe second act is very similar in that you can tell something strange is going on and you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. Again, the ultimate "reveal" isn't very interesting. The third act actually has two interesting characters, but again it's their interaction with each other that is the best part, so you really have nothing to do with that and are just an observer.\n\nUltimately, there isn't enough here to be worth your time or money, but the developer does show some talent that can be built on for future projects.","December 29, 2015","false","4.3"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","11","19","2","1"

Kind of reminded me of the old Sierra quests from the 1990s, except it took me just a little over an hour to beat. The graphics are nothing special, there's hardly any music or sound effects, but the story is nice and funny, just enough for this game to be worth it, considering its price.\n\nThe only aspect of the game that really got me annoyed was the user interface. It took me way too much time to figure out where and how many times I needed to click to use or combine items. Also, whenever there's a dialog box open, it seems like the mouse cursor doesn't need to actually be inside the box to choose an option. Too many times I ended up clicking somewhere outside the dialog box (for whatever reason), just to accidently choose something to do or say.\n\nTL;DR - A nice low-budget point & click adventure.

Its 8-bit look can be extremely annoying, and the lack of obvious "action" parts (and thus, the need to roam the cursor all over the place to seek the action spots) is a bit of PITA. The difficulty of combining parts to create a combo part to solve a particular puzzle is somewhat PITA as well. Basically, it's not clear how you can interact with certain parts.\n\nWhile it breaks no ground, and this is nowhere near a commercial quality release, with a bit more polish (16-bit sprites, better overall resolution, better character portrait that matches trading cards instead of the 8-bit sprite-look, better interface)  this can be a proper shareware style title with a free or deeply discounted first episode and paid multiple episodes or subscription.\n\nThe story is decent, and while not a long game, for one episode is is sufficiently long. The puzzles are obvious enough so must of my gripes are fighting the interface.\n\nAll in all, if you are yearning for some old-style point-and-click adventure, this may scratch the itch.","January 15","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Space Pilgrim is a space-themed point-and-click adventure made in RPG Maker that will last you less than two hours. The game is linear and offers no challenge at all (it is impossible to die/fail), so don't expect any replay value. The visual and audio design, albeit not horrid, is exceptionally average and uses a lot of existing assets (which, fairly enough, are properly mentioned in the credits).\n\nSo what is left to enjoy? The story and the writing quality. Once again, nothing offensively atrocious there; it is just... painfully average. The story has as little depth as you'd expect from such a short adventure. The dialogue has its moments, with a few chuckles coming from the clash between the scientist's cynical demeanor and Captain Pilgrim's simple-minded antics... but that's pretty much it. Nothing really memorable stands out. Surely there was room for more character development and slightly deeper exchanges, even within the context of a two-hour adventure.\n\nI will most certainly concede that Space Pilgrim is fair for its price; but I wouldn't go so far as to recommend playing it, unless you're an absolute sucker for short sci-fi stories and you feel that actual books have too many complicated words.","March 12","false","2.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","3"

While it isn't anything groundbreaking either in story, writing or character design, it isn't bad at any of those either.\n\n1. Writing is decent to good, with some endearing humour and enough detail to line out the characters. Hopefully subsequent episodes will build on that and build good, well-defined and multi-dimensional characters on this foundation.\n\n2. The story is good, some tiny twists and turns... I like that the background music forshadows the events to unfold. Subtle, but good.\n\n3. Characters have a good foundation, but no depth so far. That is to be expected from such a very short game.\n\n4. The sound design is a tad bit lacking in quantity, but what is there fits the game very well.\n\n5. Mechanically the game is very well done, for the most part. This, fortunately, isn't one of those pixel-hunting adventures - all interactables are pretty easy to find and interact with. The mouse controls seem to be a bit weird, don't really know why, but they feel slightly choppy and imprecise. Also, the game starts in windowed mode for whatever reason. Due to the nature of the game, this are just tiny annoyances, but would be nice to see them disappear in future episodes/complete release.\n\n6. The "puzzle" part of the game is shallow, but enjoyable. Most things are really easy to figure out, so far nothing to really strech your braincells. Simple but effective... it might be boring for veterans of this genre, but for relative newcommers like me, it was good enough.\n\nAll in all, a good game, well-worth the price. I sure hope the follow-up episodes will be this good, or better as well.","January 3","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I consume a lot of sci-fi, and this one pleasantly surprised me. Often indie games like this depend heavily (and fail epicly) on the writing, but this has eminently plausible dialog and a positive feel to it. I enjoyed the dialog so much it was a shame that there was no option to engage in dialog trees. Perhaps this is an RPG Maker limitation? I've only played one other RPG Maker game (To The Moon), so i was prepared to face pointless fetch quests, but Space Pilgrim manages to spice it up a bit by making the fetch quests meaningful and adding some simple inventory puzzles. For the price, this is one of the neatest sci-fi adventures i've played recently.","March 12","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Then it finished. The music was forgettable, and sound effects drowned it out. Pretty standard RPG Maker textures, runs in a small window that looks silly on a 1920x1200 monitor, and a tendency for interactive menus to dump you to the desktop without warning when backing out of them. It has zero replay value. Yet I don't regret the hour and three quarters I spent with it, or the less than 5 bucks I spent on the series (on sale).\n\nMore a linear meta-experience than a game.

I've only played the first episode so bear with me. You play as the all so clutsy yet lovely pilot, of the starship Quicksilver, Gail Pilgrim. Your objective? Get your passengers to there destination; that's it....okay well obviously that's not all of it, but I don't wanna spoil anything. I want you to go and actually play it.(Also Gail and Sabina...shipped)\n\nPuzzles aren't at all too difficult, characters are witty and charming (I love Val and Drex; totes shipped). The art style is very reminscent of old rpgs like those found on Sega or SNES. Well worth the price i paid, in fact i might just get the whole saga; I really wanna know what happens next.\n\nOnly downside, for me at least, is the fact the game only opens in a small box. I'd personally enjoy it in fullscreen, but hey thats just me.","May 1","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are interesting and have a bit of backstory to them, which is always a nice element.\nThe lengh of the game is on the shorter side of between 1.5hrs and 2hrs and it continues in Episode 2. I'm normally not a fan of Episodic games but this one I can get behind. I hope the rest of the story is like this one!","May 13","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also for those who would like to contemplate something that suggests the potential RPG Maker has, without quite fulfilling that potential. Don't buy this if you are looking for a role playing game.\n\nI didn't find this very immersive.  Instead I found not a lot happened, in a fairly predictable and cliched but pleasant manner. Then it finished. The music was forgettable, and sound effects drowned it out. Pretty standard RPG Maker textures, runs in a small window that looks silly on a 1920x1200 monitor, and a tendency for interactive menus to dump you to the desktop without warning when backing out of them. It has zero replay value. Yet I don't regret the hour and three quarters I spent with it, or the less than 5 bucks I spent on the series (on sale).\n\nMore a linear meta-experience than a game. Maybe 6.5/10?","April 20","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have to say, I was very surprised by how much I enjoyed the game!  It is a simple, straight-forward, and short story, but it has a lot of heart.  It's something like a 16 bit Firefly.  This won't be providing you with any great challenges, but it is a fun diversion for a couple of hours (perhaps a bit less), and I'm looking forward to the remaining episodes.  In fact, I'll be starting Episode II as soon as I post this review!","May 29","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
