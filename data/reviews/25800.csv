I could go on but id much rather you just scrolled up and bought the game so you can experience it for yourself. What are you waiting for?

There are many different ways to advance your country's score along the leaderboards, with the economy, diplomacy, and tactical wars being chief among them. The learning curve is pretty steep in the beginning, but you'll be able to manage the economy and diplomacy fairly quickly. I haven't even mastered the combat yet, as it takes a very RNG approach to it. Even with huge numbers and a decent general, it is still possible to lose to less-equipped forces.\n\n8/10.

Starting in 1399, The Swahili Sunnis rapidly expanded along western Africa, by 1430 they had taken Ethopia, Mutapa, and Adan along with smaller provinces.  They bid their time, eyeing to make the Hajj to Kabba in Mecca, but under a different set of circumstances.  They struck in the early 1500s, after a series of insults and casus belli was declared.  The Swahili Empire soon spread to the far reaches of Morrocco and Algiers to standing at Byzantines Walls and along the Caspian Sea.  Rather than foolhardedly attacking Europe and risking another crusade, The Swahili's played a defensive war along the European front, instead focusing on the east.  Soon the Swahili's, after many years of consolidating the Muslim world, the conquest of India and South East Asia in the 1600s, turned their eyes to Europe.  They broke through Southern Russia in an attempt to avoid upsetting the Catholics hoping they wouldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about the Orthodox heathens, Alas! Most of Europe declared war upon the Swahilis,  After a series of mishaps and severe losses on the battlefield. The Swahili was swept back to present day Turkey by about 1660s.  India at this point also had several intense rebellions, and along with a huge blow to prestige the Swahili Empire crumbled and peasent rebellions littered the middle east.  By the time the Swahili Empire had subdued and put to rest the rebellions.  It stood at about 1850s Ad.  By this time France Had been on the warpath in Europe.  England, Italy and Spain lay as their vassals, and Austria, Poland, Russia were breathing their last breath.  By the time the Swahili Empire had started to move their troops to Granada and Turkey France moved like a tank powered by a jet engine.  First Granada, then Morrocco and Turkey.  France then cut a swath south torward Yemen cutting the Swahili Empire in two.  The Indians rebelled and soon were occupied by France.  By 1950 the Swahili Empire was  no more, and France lay as Supreme empire occupying most of the three continents.\n\nTl;Dr\nNever Invade Russia in winter...or ever.\n♥♥♥♥ France....just ♥♥♥♥ it.\n10/10","February 25, 2015","true","9.9"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","73","11","15","19","0"

Europa 3, like its predecessors and its cousins Hearts of Iron and Victoria (Crusader Kings as well, but that isn't as hard to learn), is an extremely complex game that is notoriously difficult to learn, not helped by crappy tutorials. I had an edge having been playing this series since its first installment, but it still took some time to get used to everything. So right from the start expect a significant time investment on learning how to play the game, and learning to do well at it. War, Diplomacy, Trade, Exploration, and more. It's all here.\n\nBut it is worth it. Oh yes is it worth it. EU3 is a -gigantic- game with near-endless replayability and a player-driven storytelling ability (creating a story from your own experience of playing the game) in the same league as the Civilization and Sims games. You can play as any country in the world, though the game is a bit euro-centric considering the time period it covers (1399-1821) is the period in history when Europe came to dominate most of the rest of the world. Those who know their history also know that there is a MASSIVE amount of stuff contained in this time period: The fall of Byzantium and the rise of the Ottoman Turks, Columbus' voyage to America and the mass colonizing that followed, The Protestant Reformation and the horde of religious wars that came with it, Independence movements in the "settler colonies" of the Americas, and finally the French Revolution that leads to a gigantic war at the end of the game.\n\nHowever, little to nothing is set in stone. Byzantium might not fall. The Spanish may not be the ones to build a massive American colonial empire. The Protestant Reformation might just be a tiny local event, and the French Revolution might not even happen in France or at all. In other words, there is considerable variation, and much of that can be the result of the player's actions. Events can follow history or lead to an entirely different result. I've seen just about everything happen while playing this game from the Aztecs never being conquered, the Ottomans being extinguished early on (or built into the kind of monster empire you can see in my screenshots), Spain never being united as a single country, and so much more. And if you are a masochist of the highest order, you can try to take over the world as the Ryukyu Kingdom (Okinawa).\n\nHow will things go? It is up to you to see. :)","December 26, 2013","true","535.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are several ways to run your country from military badass to money grubbing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.  The way the game is setup there are actually several ways to win wars other than just beating the other guys armies.  For example, navies can be powerful because you can blocade a country and bankrupt them, easily winning a war without firing a single shot which is really interesting.

Think 'RISK' with a little bit of politics, and that's what you're going to get from Europa Universalis III. Those going in expecting amazing graphics and detailed animated battles will be disappointed, as it's simply not _that_ game.\n\nFights are math/dice roll based, which take into account unit type, general, terrain, etc so there is depth in the battles. However, visually they are represented by single unit graphic, numbers, and literally dice rolls. I don't mind this, as it suits the desk top game nature that I've come to admire from the Paradox Clausewitz Engine.\nOnce you overcome this the games become incredibly indepth, with various scenerios based on history appearing throughout the game. You can either follow them as we know them, or change the course of history.\n\nTo give you an idea of the scale the game can potentially last over the course of 400 years (if you have all the expansions) from 1399-1821. So you can start at the end of the 'Hundred Year War' and finish around the time of 'Napoleon' with all the history in between.\nThe latest DLC 'Divine Wind' adds the Far East to EUIII (Japan & China). I haven't had a chance to fully test out this area of the game yet, but it sounds detailed and exciting.\n\nIf you enjoy Empire Building (and a slight Dynasty building element), and don't mind a lack of detailed animations to keep your attention span, then this game might be for you.\n\nThere's a good thread on GAF, which has plenty of helpful people to help you understand what's going on - http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=466864","December 31, 2012","true","14.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I heard good things about the mainline series, however, so I waited for a sale on the Complete vesion before purchasing it.  Frankly, I didn't need to wait.  This game is exactly how I like my games.  Polished (which I imagine it wasn't before the various expansions), complex but not terribly challenging unless you make it so.\nMy one complaint is how this game treats the 'superiority' of the west as fact, rather than a set of very, very lucky coincidences.    For examle, in Japan, when the portugese arrived with arqubusses and some other interesting techniques, the warring daimyos were not late in adapting western techniques to their warfare, soon producing weapons of (debatably) superior quality to the portugese, while feilding armies considerably larger than anything Europe would produce for at least another century.  Why hadn't they already developed those weapons?  Because the sea protected them.  That simple.  Yet, if, in game, trade starts early, shouldn't Japan recieve some boost to tech, and not remail a century behind?   What about the  First Nations of the Americas?  Certainly the horse cultures of the plains couldn't exist before first sustained contact and horse importation, but they developed fast enough after that.  yet, they don't even appear!  Not even on the historical timelines.\nNow, my opinon is that this is a very good game that makes some poor historical assumptions.  Still leaves it a very good game, even if that limits it somewhat.  Trade is king, until late game, colonization is overpowered for western factions, and there are definitely ways to game the engine (royal marriages, anyone?).  It is, essensially, a sandbox, and you can choose your own goals, which means creating a great empire isn't required.\nAll in all?  9/10","June 23, 2014","true","405.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The time span is good (1399 to 1821) giving a lot of time for experimentation and fun as well as Change. Each faction has a number of ways to change it, depending on your tastes, this is done through a number of policy sliders as well as national and religious policies, these could be anything from adding a liqour tax to the union of an entire country (there are many of these such as forming Britain, Germany, Italy and Russia), which can make the game incredibly fun, over all I would give this a 9 out of 10, the only problem being the learning curve and subpar Tutorial","April 9, 2013","true","731.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether you want to pick up the kingdom of Castille to recreate the Spanish Empire, pick Napoleonic France and conquer Moscow or conquer the world as Ryuku, the game allows you to. On top of this, you have a diplomatic AI that works far better than their counterparts in most other large strategy games. The game consists of so many well thought out mechanics and gameplay aspects that you could play hundreds of hours, still having many challenges left and countries to conquer. But the scale comes at a cost: One too many abstractions to make the game completely immersive coupled with a not quite competent AI and bugs that at unlucky times can be gamebreaking keeps me from giving the game a perfect 10.

Graphics aren't that good, but for me that doesn't matter at all. The game has a steep learning curve, which might stop some people from playing, but once you master it all, than you really start enjoying the game. A downside might be that the military aspect isn't as deep as other fields of the game are, or compared to other paradox games like HOI, and newer March of the Eagles, but it's still good enough to be enjoyable and fun. Also another bad thing, is the multiplayer avaiability, its hard to get a game, and you might need to use some 3rd party software such as Hamachi in order to get the game working. Multiplayer itself however, is one of the best things you can do, up to 32 players, with same abilities as in singleplayer, the games can be amazing, whether you team up with your friend to dominate the world, or be worst enemies and fight eachother or somebody else.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mangudai/recommended/25800/","Mangudai","Mangudai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mangudai/","85 products in account","In a genre of grand strategy RTS games, Paradox games are usually the best, and this one is no exception, an ability to control any nation in the world, in depth country managing mechanics, a timeframe starting in 1399 in High Medieval timeframe, trough Rennaisance, to Reformation and Counter Reformation with 30 years war, to Spanish Succesion wars, than to 17th and 18th century European Imperialism, to the Napoleonic wars ending in 1821. Graphics aren't that good, but for me that doesn't matter at all. The game has a steep learning curve, which might stop some people from playing, but once you master it all, than you really start enjoying the game. A downside might be that the military aspect isn't as deep as other fields of the game are, or compared to other paradox games like HOI, and newer March of the Eagles, but it's still good enough to be enjoyable and fun. Also another bad thing, is the multiplayer avaiability, its hard to get a game, and you might need to use some 3rd party software such as Hamachi in order to get the game working. Multiplayer itself however, is one of the best things you can do, up to 32 players, with same abilities as in singleplayer, the games can be amazing, whether you team up with your friend to dominate the world, or be worst enemies and fight eachother or somebody else. All in all, this game is great.","April 13, 2013","true","241.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The time span is good (1399 to 1821) giving a lot of time for experimentation and fun as well as Change. Each faction has a number of ways to change it, depending on your tastes, this is done through a number of policy sliders as well as national and religious policies, these could be anything from adding a liqour tax to the union of an entire country (there are many of these such as forming Britain, Germany, Italy and Russia), which can make the game incredibly fun, over all I would give this a 9 out of 10, the only problem being the learning curve and subpar Tutorial","April 9, 2013","true","731.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Go play Pac Man or Streetfighter or some other button masher, because this game will just hurt your wittle feelings.\nIt's old.  The graphics are mediocre at best and god help whatever tonedeaf goober composed the soundtrack.  None of which takes one iota of shine off the proverbial apple that is this game.  Simply put it is a masterpiece of strategic gaming.  To date this is Paradox's definitive opus.  It somehow manages to maintain beguiling simplicity side-by-side with byzantine depth.\nWhen you first start playing around with it you will probably fumble around like a weetodd on a trampoline(no offence to all you 'todds out there), but you'll STILL be able to make satisfying headway.  And once you have a firm grasp of the mechanics you'll be orchestrating Machiavellian plots that will bring massive swathes of the world under your evil (let's just face it you warmongering bastage) grasp.\nIf you can master the mechanics of this baby you're well on your way to being a fully qualified field marshall of strategic gaming.  I highly recommend this game to anyone just getting into Paradox's line of strategy games.  It's a far more refined product than it's successor game EU 4 is at this point.\n10 out of 10 and you can take that to the bank.","December 21, 2013","true","761.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The music is great but to be honest I normally play with the music off but it was still lovely to listen to when I first heard it, the game runs perfectly on my desktop and I also tested it on my old rubbish laptop which has been in a cupboard since 2008 and it runs perfect on that too so if you have an old desktop/laptop this game is fine.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DovahkiinCroatia/recommended/25800/","DovahkiinCroatia","Dovahkiin=Croatia=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DovahkiinCroatia/","73 products in account","The monolithic historical simulator from Paradox gets a makeover with lessons learned from Victoria, Crusader Kings and Hearts of Iron. The most noticeable improvement from EU2 is the 3D graphics and polished interface. The graphics don’t do as much for the look of the game as much as it simplifies the look of the map. Gone is that “boardgame” feel of EU2 as land, cities and armies have more of an organic feel to them rather then just being markers.\n\nA great new improvement is national ideas. By specializing your country in certain aspects of warfare, trade, exploration and colonization or religion, you can get your goals accomplished easier. What is interesting is you will see some nations choose some very ahistorical ideas. In other words, imagine Poland recruiting conquistadors to colonize Central America. (Would they even be called “conquistadors?”)\n\nThe AI in EU3 is considerably harder and smarter. If you post an army at a neighbor’s border, don’t be surprised if he does the same. Beyond warfare, allies will betray you, rivals will rush to colonize the best provinces, and nations will band together to stop your expansion.\n\nOverall, EU3 just plays differently than its predecessor. Random events aren’t as “random” as before and every choice you make effects the decisions you will make in the future. This makes the game play along more natural storylines.\n\nThe retail version comes with a beautiful 145 page manual that describes pretty much all you need to know to play a game. The tutorials will help you navigate the interface but the majority of learning comes from playing the game itself.","March 27, 2013","true","89.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you love map painting, then this game is for you - all the politics in Europa Universalis III is about one ultimate goal: Annihilate everyone until you are the only one left or you get bored and start all over, preferably as a different country. Some countries are better represented, other are just there to exist and perish, but overall there are enough interesting states to provide a huge amount of gameplay, especially with all the add-ons. Unfortunately, for me this game is a rather bland experience. I would vote "average" if it was possible on Steam, however, it is not. This is the worst series that comes from Paradox studio, because it doesn't provide any internal politics like Crusader Kings, nor any interesting economics and population control like Victoria. The wars are not as detailed and do not require much thinking either, this isn't anything like Hearts of Iron, where the player is challenged and has to adapt to the changing war and apply appropriate tactics. Europa Universalis III is just about attacking smaller country and overrunning it quickly with army, taking it over and repeating the same thing all the time. It has other elements of gameplay, but nothing of importance. Unlike other Paradox games EU III doesn't focus on any particular aspect of running a country, hence it is quite void of content and feels bland.\n\nI would recommend playing Victoria II, Crusader Kings 2 or Hearts of Iron III over Europa Universalis III, depending on what exactly are you looking in such a game, because EU III has nothing special about it.\n","March 24","false","6.8"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","7","15","2","0"

There are crashing issues as well.\n\nAlso, this game is not great. Lots of clicking to get simple things done or to get information that should be readily apparent.\n\nRecruiting units is a pain: Click province, click unit button, click unit. Click next province, click unit button, click unit. Click next province, click unit button, click unit... on and on ad nauseum.\n\nYou have to click on individual armies and open up a dialogue to see how large they are. There is no indication for this on the campaign map. Good luck keeping everything straight.\n\nOh, and good luck selecting a fleet, instead of the port it's next to; or not pulling your hair out trying to get just the ships you want out of a group of fleets (group select, and then individually close each individual fleet you don't want... instead of being able to simply select the one you do want).\n\nOh, and nations are not labelled on the political mapmode... what's with that? They're color coded, but if you want to see who that is, you have to click on one of their provinces and hope you didn't actually select one of their neighbors who's a slightly different shade of yellow. Again, good luck keeping anything straight.\n\nTrade and diplomacy are similarly inscrutable. They have mapmodes, but centers of trade are not labelled, and there's no visual indication of how trade flows from one place to another; unless you open individial trade center menus and learn to read them. Not for the faint of heart or the casual player.\n\nBasically... skip this one. The only reason I played it at all is that EUIV has trouble running on my machine and I can't afford an upgrade just yet. But even if this were the newest outing... there are a lot of gaps where any game dev who was giving it serious thought might easily have tripped over a better solution than what they have implemented.","October 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"A grand scale strategy game" and all that. In the end, though, the whole deal turns into numbers going by and the player hoping for something to happen. Status Quo is maintained as far as possible. I'll rather read a history book.\n\nIt would have helped to design this the same way the Total War games have been designed: turn based strategy, real time battles - or even the same way Civilization has been designed (I'll have to give EU III this: the game mechanics aren't as corny as in Civ... but EU still manages to be less interesting). In EU III you can drop a merchant, a spy, or an army somewhere and wait. That's all the action you will get. The game might be good otherwise but really, the player doesn't have a whole lot to do in it. Sometimes something happens but it's way too minor to keep me interested for long. If you're a natural born bookkeeper you will love this game.\n\nIt has to be mentioned that I read books and play chess, too. It's not gore that I'm missing: I don't like shoot-them-ups for several reasons. Also, I'm not a kid any more, so my attention span is pretty long.

All it does is ♥♥♥♥ you off with it's narrow view approach to the game. They don't explain how jack works, they just say here is the here and there is the there. Oh, you wanted to actually know what the here does? HHAHAHAHA ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!! FIGURE IT  OUT YO ♥♥♥♥ING SELF YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥ HAHAHAH YOU THOUGHT A TUTORIAL WAS ACTUALLY SUSPOSED TO TEACH? AHAHAHAHHA LULZZZLZLZ  TROLLLLEEDDDDDD ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!!!!!\n\nOh, what's that? want to learn how combat in the game works? HAHAHAHHA ♥♥♥♥ YOU!!!! We will tell you to move units to x province and when they get there..... NOTHING, ♥♥♥♥ING NOTHING1!!!! AREN'T WE JUST THE ♥♥♥♥ING FUNNIEST DUDES TO EVER DESIGN A GAME? ♥♥♥♥ bug testing, we are much too busy pulling DLC out of our own arses just to keep you checking the store every month just to make sure your edition is still the 'complete' edition. LULZZZZ TROLLED YA ♥♥♥♥♥ HAHAHAHA.\n\nGetting back to the UI though. Looks like it was designed in 1999 for 800x600 displays. I mean there is NO UI scaling when playing at 1080p so get used to squinting at your monitor or invest in one of those mountable magnifying glasses they sell for reading books. Or you could just give up and play at a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low resolution like Paradox wants you to do. Oh and the defualt refresh rate is 25Hz because..... reasons.\n\nThe UI is just damn outdated for a game that came out in 2007, I mean come on.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nBuying the DLC does not fix the any of the aforementioned problems, I have the complete edition and the game still glitches when playing the tutorials. I was told to move my man at arms to a neighboring county in one tutorial. I've done so repeatedly and it never registers with the game. I also have to disable one of my monitors (I have a duel setup) just to launch the game, at it's default settings the game runs at 30 fps which for some reason for me makes the screen flicker much like a CRT monitor, I had to bump it up to 60fps for smooth play.\n\nThat's not all, the font at 1920x1080 is all but unreadable. I pretty much have to press my nose to the screen just to decipher the terribly small font they used. I've tried lowering the resolution only to have my monitor go out of range forcing me to hard boot my PC thereby loosing a topic I was writing about in my browser.\n\nAll of the first tutorials require restarts after successfully completing one or the game will crash upon attempting the second. Load times are a joke for such a small install game and the time it take initially to precache everything is close to 5 minutes, and this is with me rocking a SSD.\n\nOf the little over 60 minutes I've invested in this game at least half of it has been waiting screens and the other half chasing down glitches in the game play. 0/10 Unplayable mess.\n\nP.S. before you inevitably down vote me for expressing my dissatisfied experience as a paying customer please let me know exactly how my analysis is incorrect and what I'm doing wrong.

I gotta say though, the game looked promising. Once I opened it, the interface for a game was very clumsy. It was hard to select a unit, and hard to do other basic things that should be easy to learn. I found nothing interesting or intriguing about the game, so after watching a few tutorials, and playing for 2 hours, I gave up. Maybe I am missing something, but this game is lacking in many areas such as UI, gameplay, and controls. Maybe I was spoiled by the simplicty of Civ:5, but I would not reccomend this game to beginners of this genre.","June 14, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

I think that it is a good piece of work, and it is quite complex, which is not by any means a bad characteristic. I think that the game does a good show on the historic part, and I'm quite the nerd into history, to be honest, and from what I saw, it's very precise. The AI is good, but can be sometimes predictable, and cannot do any moves that'd "shock" me.  I wish I could rate the multiplayer, but since I did not test it out, I cannot, however, the multiplayer DOES seem to be very fun and promising (Up to 32 players, if I recall.), I'll update this review if I play it. The graphics aren't that perfect, but I think that considering the year of this game (2008-2009), it is not really that much of a "sin" in gaming. One of the biggest problems (Well, it's more-less a personal addiction problem that I have with myself) I have is the habit of Paradox making a lot of content-heavy DLCs for this game, that really make me want, no, NEED to buy the DLC. For instance the DLC "Heir to The Throne" adds a whole lot of features, that don't make the game AS much fun, as forming Personal Unions, inheriting country, being able to unite the Holy Roman Empire into a single country, etc. However, if you plan on getting this game, I recommend you having a lot of money in your wallet, as I recommend buying ATLEAST Europa Universlais III AND Heir to The Throne.\nThat being said, my final rating is:\n\n8.0","September 11, 2013","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But. And I mean But. This game man!\n\nSince buying it I have not been able to kick the addiction. I'm a big RTS guy I’ve played all the Total Wars, AoE blah blah blah. But not much comes close to the world sculpting that can be had in EU III.\n\nSo let’s get the Negatives out the way...\n\nI have mentioned already that the graphics aren’t the best in the world, but who can blame it; it’s from 2007! I had barely finished collage for Christ sake. Also when compared to its smoothed out big brother EU4 well I can seem rather flat, but this is not where the magic is.\nSecondly, the learning curve. Wow, now I’ve played RTS’s but Paradox was all like here is the deep end; to some one whose body was so unprepared for this kind adult swim. Don’t get me wrong it is hard, yes; and the tutorial might as well not exist, but if you have patience (at some points of a god!) then you will be rewarded with a game that you constantly want to re-work and shape to your tyrannical desires.\n\nRight, now that’s over positives.\n\nDepth of game play. An all encompassing statement I know, but I cannot overstate this enough. If you want to get as close as you can to that real empire builder, the management of All the expenses then here is the game for you. As I said before the learning curve is steep what with having to fight wars, deal with intricate economic politics, diplomatic management that encompasses the entire globe, region culture, religion, crusades, jihads.\nThe list is endless; and so are the out comes no two games are ever the same. One moment your Muscovy and destroying your Russian and Lithuanian nemesis! Then Denmark loses its Personal Union with Sweden, and all of a sudden you have a western power house mercilessly pounding a nail into your snowy Finish skull.\n\nThis game is so big, so enthralling and ever changing; that it is very difficult to get board of it. Get some friends and jump on multiplayer and you will see just how much bigger this game gets. Get this game!","March 31, 2015","true","497.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are no set goals, you can decide freely about what you consider to be a succesfull campaign. The game does suggest you choose from a subset of nations that were worked out in detail, but the game feels so well made that it isn't impossible to play as another nation.\n\nThe AI of a strategy game is always extremely important. This game doesn't handicap the player or boost the AIs economy to be challenging, which is always a good sign. It does suffer from predictability in the diplomatic department, and sometimes decisions that don't make strategic sense can only be explained through game statistics (example: "Ah, I see, they hate me and they can't see my armies so they attack me even though it's not in their best interests." or "Their war weariness is quite high so even though I entered the war on their side they still accept a disadvantageous peace almost immediately."), but on the whole it is very satisfying to ally with or fight against.\n\nWhere this game shines most is in the multiplayer department. This truly is the new Risk as far as I'm concerned, but better, much better. Convince your playgroup to play this for a few hours each week and you won't be disappointed.\n\nSome might be bothered by the fact that there is no real goal and thus no real winner, but I actually adore that aspect, it is a matter of taste. Some might be bothered by the lack of tactics (battles are fought mostly by statistics and dice rolls), but the strategic depth is such that I firmly believe that was a wise decision from the developers. And some will be bothered by the lack of flashy graphics. The look is purely functional, and the interface with all the menus and buttons already felt archaïc the moment this game was released. Anyway, for those people there is the Total War series (which I love as well), but those are the only real advantages that franchise has over this one.\n\n9/10","January 13, 2014","true","101.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've spend several hours at a time just watching the in game time pass and the other countries gain and lose ground.

Civilization V has just civilizations, and not nearly as many (but each one is unique), with no acurate map included with the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fregle/recommended/25800/","fregle","Fregle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fregle/","79 products in account","Anybody who likes grand strategy games should enjoy Europa Universalis 3.\n\nIt offers a convincing historical setting where you can play as one of the great nations of that time (or as one of the minnows), and try to alter history as you see fit. There are no set goals, you can decide freely about what you consider to be a succesfull campaign. The game does suggest you choose from a subset of nations that were worked out in detail, but the game feels so well made that it isn't impossible to play as another nation.\n\nThe AI of a strategy game is always extremely important. This game doesn't handicap the player or boost the AIs economy to be challenging, which is always a good sign. It does suffer from predictability in the diplomatic department, and sometimes decisions that don't make strategic sense can only be explained through game statistics (example: "Ah, I see, they hate me and they can't see my armies so they attack me even though it's not in their best interests." or "Their war weariness is quite high so even though I entered the war on their side they still accept a disadvantageous peace almost immediately."), but on the whole it is very satisfying to ally with or fight against.\n\nWhere this game shines most is in the multiplayer department. This truly is the new Risk as far as I'm concerned, but better, much better. Convince your playgroup to play this for a few hours each week and you won't be disappointed.\n\nSome might be bothered by the fact that there is no real goal and thus no real winner, but I actually adore that aspect, it is a matter of taste. Some might be bothered by the lack of tactics (battles are fought mostly by statistics and dice rolls), but the strategic depth is such that I firmly believe that was a wise decision from the developers. And some will be bothered by the lack of flashy graphics. The look is purely functional, and the interface with all the menus and buttons already felt archaïc the moment this game was released. Anyway, for those people there is the Total War series (which I love as well), but those are the only real advantages that franchise has over this one.\n\n9/10","January 13, 2014","true","101.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I absolutely ADORE this game. I honestly can't get enough of it. Though it has a massive learning curve after you get the basics of economy, stability, and diplomacy you'll find that this is one of the best of it's kind.\nSet in a time period between 1399 and 1821 you begin the game as one of the nations that once (or still does) own any ammount of land throughout the world. From there you manage relations, economy, military, technology, and many other things as you attempt to create a large and glorious nation for your people. Build alliances with your neighbors or lay seige to their lands but beware the Golden Horde of Eastern Europe, or the mighty power of Ming for they have a vast empire and are not to be trifled with. So, mighty King what have you to say for your nation? Are you the mighty who strike with an iron fist, or those who would like to buy out the world? Can you lead your people to greatness, or will you lead them to an early grave?\n\nGameplay wise the game is fairly simple. Through many menus you'll be able to manage your money, how much you invest in your military and technology, and what policies your nation will take. As for the battles in the game it's all based on the terrain your armies fight in, if you've given your army a general and what general is more effective, and army composition. (Note: You do NOT control what happens in the battle. You just tell your army to attack the other and the game generates an outcome.)\nOverall this is a really great game, and I'd recommend it to anyone particularly those into grand strategies such as this. I'd recommend playing as England (Just take Scotland and Ireland then use your Navy for defence),or France (HUGE military power in this game. Only reason these fellows don't command the world is due to the large nation of Spain to the southwest, England being a island with a large navy, and the Holy Roman Empires sheer numbers.) 9/10.","April 19, 2013","true","538.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've spend several hours at a time just watching the in game time pass and the other countries gain and lose ground.

Don´t be put off by reviews warning you about how difficult everything is! Truly mastering the game will take a long time, but it's easy enough to get the hang of things within a few hours. After that, you'll be leading a country through the centuries, using policy sliders and national ideas to guide it into a certain direction. It´s worth it. And whether your country becomes a champion of free trade, a despotic heathen smashing republic or still something else is up to you.\n\nEU3 doesn't have Civ's relentless focus on linear advancement, however. Not every change is necessarily always a good one. Your great and enlightened ideas help your country progress, but they may also ignite revolts and other misery, setting you back years and inviting hungry neighbors in.\n\nIf that appeals to you, try EU3 Chronicles (which has all the expansions). I should add that EU4 is out now, but EU3 is still very worth considering, as it looks good, still offers deep and diverse gameplay and runs well on older systems.","September 6, 2011","true","240.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that it is a good piece of work, and it is quite complex, which is not by any means a bad characteristic. I think that the game does a good show on the historic part, and I'm quite the nerd into history, to be honest, and from what I saw, it's very precise. The AI is good, but can be sometimes predictable, and cannot do any moves that'd "shock" me.  I wish I could rate the multiplayer, but since I did not test it out, I cannot, however, the multiplayer DOES seem to be very fun and promising (Up to 32 players, if I recall.), I'll update this review if I play it. The graphics aren't that perfect, but I think that considering the year of this game (2008-2009), it is not really that much of a "sin" in gaming. One of the biggest problems (Well, it's more-less a personal addiction problem that I have with myself) I have is the habit of Paradox making a lot of content-heavy DLCs for this game, that really make me want, no, NEED to buy the DLC. For instance the DLC "Heir to The Throne" adds a whole lot of features, that don't make the game AS much fun, as forming Personal Unions, inheriting country, being able to unite the Holy Roman Empire into a single country, etc. However, if you plan on getting this game, I recommend you having a lot of money in your wallet, as I recommend buying ATLEAST Europa Universlais III AND Heir to The Throne.\nThat being said, my final rating is:\n\n8.0","September 11, 2013","true","77.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fregle/recommended/25800/","fregle","Fregle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fregle/","79 products in account","Anybody who likes grand strategy games should enjoy Europa Universalis 3.\n\nIt offers a convincing historical setting where you can play as one of the great nations of that time (or as one of the minnows), and try to alter history as you see fit. There are no set goals, you can decide freely about what you consider to be a succesfull campaign. The game does suggest you choose from a subset of nations that were worked out in detail, but the game feels so well made that it isn't impossible to play as another nation.\n\nThe AI of a strategy game is always extremely important. This game doesn't handicap the player or boost the AIs economy to be challenging, which is always a good sign. It does suffer from predictability in the diplomatic department, and sometimes decisions that don't make strategic sense can only be explained through game statistics (example: "Ah, I see, they hate me and they can't see my armies so they attack me even though it's not in their best interests." or "Their war weariness is quite high so even though I entered the war on their side they still accept a disadvantageous peace almost immediately."), but on the whole it is very satisfying to ally with or fight against.\n\nWhere this game shines most is in the multiplayer department. This truly is the new Risk as far as I'm concerned, but better, much better. Convince your playgroup to play this for a few hours each week and you won't be disappointed.\n\nSome might be bothered by the fact that there is no real goal and thus no real winner, but I actually adore that aspect, it is a matter of taste. Some might be bothered by the lack of tactics (battles are fought mostly by statistics and dice rolls), but the strategic depth is such that I firmly believe that was a wise decision from the developers. And some will be bothered by the lack of flashy graphics. The look is purely functional, and the interface with all the menus and buttons already felt archaïc the moment this game was released. Anyway, for those people there is the Total War series (which I love as well), but those are the only real advantages that franchise has over this one.\n\n9/10","January 13, 2014","true","101.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

EUIV focuses too much on making money by releasing ridiculously small DLC and upsetting game balances.\n\nYou're in charge of a country, whether this is a historical country or a custom one, and you have to set yourself a goal. World domination will take you weeks, months, or even years to complete depending on how well you dig in and plan your battles ahead of time. Try going for something a little bit less ambitious; like wiping a neighbouring nation off the face of the planet, or being the first to circumnavigate the globe.\n\nBalancing everything in your nation from political to economic to simply trying to figure out why that one pesky province keeps rioting against your (fair) rule is a full-time task, and while you may be forgiven for setting the clock speed to very fast to see that one project to completion, your neighbours may use that precise moment to invade your nation.\n\nWhile EUIV adds some extra bits and bobs, EUIII is challenging enough in its own right to keep you busy for a long time.","September 29, 2015","true","108.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blitz2357/recommended/25800/","blitz2357","Blitz2357","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blitz2357/","24 products in account","Product received for free\n\nI consider this game to be a classic and a gem. If you are a person who loves to play really, really, REALLY involved strategy games, then you seriously need to consider getting this game. To be honest, "Divine Wind", which is the final expansion to the game Europa Universalis III, is the only version I know because when I got this game it had all of the expansions with it. However, I am sure that this review can still apply to the base game and other expansions.\n\nThe best way I can describe this game is that it is an open-ended grand strategy game, in which you set out to achieve whatever you want - there are no victory conditions and no end game objectives. The fact that you can play as ANY kingdom, principality, republic, etc. within the game's timeframe makes it even more amazing.\n\nThe amount of depth that goes into this game is unparalleled by any other game I've ever played. There is so much fine detail involved that I learn something new about how the game works almost every time I play. And that's saying something considering how long I've played. Every aspect of the game from economy, military, politics, religion, exploration, and so on, is very detailed and it all ties together rather nicely.\n\nWhat makes this game great too is that it leads to epic unwritten stories that take unexpected twists and turns throughout the game. You will be amazed at how a once-proud and mighty country that is a serious rival and threat to you in the early game can end up being completely dismantled by either you or the other computer controlled nations. And when one menace falls, there always seems to be another even bigger and more threatening one that takes its place. And sometimes, this mid/late game menace started out as a puny nation that got very lucky and quietly took advantage of opportunities...only to end up being crushed by another country, such as yours. And no two campaigns are ever the same.\n\nOver the course of the game, you will get hit by dozens of random events that occur. These events can range from beneficial like giving you claims on wealthy neighboring lands, to disastrous like a major rebellion in your country. Many of these events give you multiple options, which can lead to difficult decisions that have to be made.\n\nAnd beware of neighboring rivals who will declare war on you and effectively kick you while you're down - something the AI LOVES to do to you. You will also notice that computer controlled nations like to form deep alliances, where even declaring war on a tiny nation could possibly lead to a war with half of Europe teammed up against you.\n\nBut all of these things are what make Europa Universalis III challenging and entertaining. Trying to figure out how to defeat great alliances, trying to manage your country's economy as you build a global empire, etc., all leads to a supreme sense of achievement at the end of a campaign. Whenever I finish a full campaign, I like to sit back and admire what I achieved, and consider what I could have done differently.\n\nNow, this game is VERY demanding in terms of time and commitment. You need to set aside plenty of time to play this game in order to fully enjoy and appreciate playing it. You also need to have a lot of patience as this is a rather slow-paced game (for good reason though). And if you've never taken on a grand strategy game before (like me, before I played this game), then you will probably find that this game has a major learning curve. But I encourage you to persevere because it is well worth it.\n\nOverall, words cannot describe how incredible Europa Universalis III is; it has to be experienced. If you have the time, patience, and most importantly, ambition, then you should seriously consider playing this game.\nI rate this game at 10/10","May 13","true","401.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No, not really, but it can be quite fun to conquer the world as some minor regional country.\n\nAlso, there are some mechanical differences, which really aren\'t important unless you\'re playing the game in Multiplayer.\n\nI will say, it\'s extremely hard to ever make a non-Western country defensible against a Western one. Even the Ottomons will regularly get taken apart by the 1700s due to the way military techonlogy progresses in this one.\n\nThe sequel is better, but it\'s expensive. If you can\'t afford EU4+DLC, just get this . It will be a fun diversion till you can upgrade.","June 1","true","285.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
