Why?  Because while you'd think your choices would matter like in other similar games, they really don't.  Most choices you face lead to the same exact results and I don't mean it as in the long run.  Let's say you have the choice between killing or not killing someone.  First run through you'll go with one choice and next one pick the opposite choices figuring the story would be entirely different but no.  If you choose to spare the person the game will let you but most of the time when you choose to kill the person, you'll either fail or be interrupted, effectively making the game painfully linear.\n\nYou can't choose your own adventure, it's already been chosen for you.","November 8, 2015","false","5.5"," 118 of 130 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","118","130","0","2"

Or perhaps the more tech/gadget-focused, stone-cold killer villain? If so, then Diabolical is definitely the interactive novel for you! Choose your minions, pick your lair, decide on what kind of weapons you want to use, and don't forget to spend some downtime with your goons at your underwater lake (bingo has always been a favourite).\n\nDiabolical is a beautiful homage to the stereotypical comic book or TV cartoon villain, and now you can take on this role for yourself. You're a young and upcoming new villain, trying to steal or murder you way through the world and climb up in the ranks so you can end up with the big baddies. However, one of the big baddies turns out to be Really Freaking Evil, the biggest villain organisation ever is on your trail, and the good guys won't leave you alone either. Who will you ally with? And will you save the world, destroy it or do something ridiculously over-the-top with it?\n\nThe Good+ Hilarity! Ham acting! Buying lava for your secret volcano lair!\n+ Also includes a few more serious moments amongst all the light fun\n+ There's plenty of interesting villains (and heroes) around who (1) gossip about you, (2) are in your way, (3) want to kill you or (4) want you to join them\n+ The possibility to have a threesome in space\n\nThe Bad- At 130,000 words, it's relatively short, and you can finish it in ± 1.5 hours\n- The choices aren't very imaginative, and sometimes don't really have impact on the story\n- There is little depth to the characters, including your own\n- Limited romance options\n- No save points and no skip options\n\nIf you're looking for an interactive novel that doesn't take itself seriously in which you can become the villain, then you will probably like this game. Just mind the short length of it, and the fact that some of the choices aren't as impactful as I'm used to in Choose Your Own Adventure games. You also don't get to customise your character to a great degree.\n\nIn the end though, I had a lot of fun playing as a theatrical gadget-focused villain who had a threesome in space but eventually saved the world -- and I will definitely replay this game again!","February 7","true","1.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You can be a "Technomancer", but other characters are explicitly possessed of superpowers, and the technology is basically magic, anyway.\n\nAll-in-all, it's pretty goofy, and wears its comic book inspiration on its sleeve, to the extent that it even tells you to read about name-dropped heroes and villains in back-issues of their own fictional comics, and I mean that in only the best way.  Taking the "pragmatic" choices are the sane ones, but I can't help but laugh and keep picking the "theatrical" choices that involve burning the money you stole, volcano lairs, and other feats of ludicrous supervillainy done more just because it would be hilarious than for any real purpose.  Even as someone who generally doesn't like playing "Dark Side" paths in any "moral choice" game, this game crosses the line twice and by a large enough margin to make it all hilarious.\n\n... Just don't expect to take any of it serously. In the opening, a security guard gets the drop on you with a gun, and you can somehow chloriform her before she can fire a shot at you... from several feet away, when she was behind you, and already had her gun out and ready to fire... So yeah, Rule of Cool and Sorting Algorithm of Evil is in full effect, and practical skills are useless against the Awesome But Impractical.\n\nIt's dirt cheap, and it's worth a good laugh, even if it is a little short, even for an Interactive Fiction game.  My only complaint is that it could have been longer.","November 10, 2015","true","7.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Seems to be able to go from serious to silly without much clash. Also, the writing is just immersive to the extreme. It's so illustrative that I forget I'm actually reading. It's really good value for money. I always say that if you enjoy a dollar per hour [USD] of gameplay than you should safely recommend the game.\n\nI never really felt "in danger" except in character. That's totally new to me. I find that a positive thing for a game with such depth. I was more afraid of being a fool in game rather than having to "die" and restart. Not sure if you can die, but I am positive you can lose and end up without improving or what have you statwise.\n\nIt's a unique game, get it!

Not being a fan of Zork-like games I didn't take a liking to all-reading, no-action gameplay. But I now find myself wanting to play again and again, traveling down all the branching story paths I didn't take the previous time around. The writing in this game is phenomenal, with the humor being the strong suit. Many games don't make me laugh, and never with their dialogue, but I now have to make an exception for this game. All of the jokes are original and made me laugh a little more than I should have, which is kinda sad when you think about it. Alongside the humor, the descriptive detail used really scuplted the world I had pictured in my mind, further drawing me into the story. It wasn't hard to picture myself as the up and coming villain that this story creates by allowing me to choose how I felt on the matter at hand. Didn't like a janitor I found? Shot him. But when confronted with yelling at a waiter, I couldn't bring myself to do it and instead complimented him on his crude pancakes.

At this point you probably are a bit confused, so let me dissect the issue; In a "Choose your own adventure" game you are the main character, your choices make your personal out comes and paint a picture with the brush of your psyche: the game is a sandy beach and you the castle building child, each castle is different, yet all are clearly castle inspired by medieval architecture. In "interactive light novels" however, this is not the case; these games are more of showing you a(n) (almost) linear story, yet allowing you to be a part of the story, getting you attached to characters based on your actions, not to mention letting you feel the impact of the story first hand instead of the second hand method of traditional novella. Yet these two are not completely isolated from each other, rather they represent a spectrum of possibilities for games to exist in. Examples of games that heavily focus on only one side are: "Long Live The Queen" and "Monster Loves You!" for "Choose your own adventure" and "Zombie High" by Delight games llc for "interactive light novels".\n\nThis game, while wearing the mask of  "Choose your own adventure", upon close inspection is somewhere around the middle, casting a wide net in a manner of speaking. A visible blow, in my opinion, to the overall sense and game play as this identity crisis chips away at a solid and enjoyable core.\n\nDespite my criticisms (including the fact that I still don't know if the game has RNG or runs on a flat number based skill check), I love it. Villainy is most often used as a gimmick, yet here you can glimpse at it being done well, and that alone was hook, line, and sinker for me. After all, villains are almost never main characters/well represented beyond one cliché or another (as playable characters, of course).","November 18, 2015","true","12.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

However you should know that there is no music or art in here - I mean literally nothing at all. Its pretty much just writing, so if that doesn't sound like a good time to you, don't buy it. The good news is that the writing in Diabolical is good, even when you take into account that it is really the only thing it has.

Your actions doesn't really affect the story and it really pisses me off how you apparently are just a pathethic villain the entire story rather than being capable of becoming a true nightmare. I always wanted to give a go at "being the villain" for once, but you just can't achieve that in this game.\nOne of the things that really managed to enrage me was the fact that you could go on an almost-genocide run but then  you encounter a group of kids inside one of the vaults when you are robbing a bank, and the game lectures you on why you wouldn't kill them, despite the fact that you may have almost wiped off the population of an entire city, or set dozens of people on fire with a flamethrower, because, you know, ethical dilemas.  What the f...?! Really?!\nPros:\n-The humour, it's very witty and entertaining.\nCons:\n-You don't really choose who you are, or how does your story unravel.\n-Prepare to be humiliated on every possible scenario.\n-Don't expect your "killing choices" to be effective. If you wanted to play as a psychopath for fun, tough cookies.","February 17","false","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Along the way you face challenges from superheroes, law enforcement, other villains, and off-brand versions of a variety of famous characters.\n\nWhile the basic storyline always passes through the same outline, you have a lot of flexibility in how you go about your evildoing and it has a strong effect on how others react to you. I went through the entire story twice in a row, playing once as a Doctor Octopus type science villain and then as the Cesar Romero version of the Joker. Each time, the reactions of major characters and even my own best options in combat changed to match my villainous style.\n\nThe only negative I can think of is that the romances seemed to be really easy to get -- to the point that I'd probably have to deliberately set out to antagonize those characters to fail at it. Other play styles might lead to a different experience, though.","May 28","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
