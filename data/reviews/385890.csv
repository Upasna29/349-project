No joke or exaggeration.\n\nNow before I explain why please let me say I played this game for two straight hours and read the forums and the wikia information about all the heroes as I'm a competitive player. I even purchased the $5 (on sale now for $4) DLC artifact pack. What a surprise, it didn't work. Nothing was added to my account not after relogging, restarting the game and doing the same things again AFTER playing another game.\n\nI played 6 matches, now there is no real "progression" for your character outside of finding random items from killing monster camps during the actual match. Which doubles also as being the main objective, yes there is PvP but participating in this severely slows your ability to score "gold" for your team AKA points and hinders your ability to win.\n\nAs far as the item system goes its completely randomized, but its ♥♥♥♥ing terrible after 6 matches I finally found ONE item that was not your typical "blue" magic property item it was an ARTIFACT yellow colored and was a weapon with over 3 times the power of my current blue weapon. The catch was that the artifact found has a 24 hour timer, which after it expires will disappear. Forever. That's right when you finally get loot it goes away on its own magically. Of course UNLESS you spent $5 to buy "black pearls" the games premium currency and "transmute" the artifact to remove the 24 hour cooldown timer on your "found" loot.\n\nSo in essence, this is literally the worst ♥♥♥♥ing cash-grab pay to win game I've ever experienced in over 20 years of gaming. Its quite sad becasue the idea of a PvEvP MOBA really sounds unique and appealing. I would've loved to see this game work, sadly its being run by some trashy foreign greedy company with no real insight or clue how to run a successful free to play game.\n\n/end rant review or whatever you wanna call this","September 24, 2015","false","13.0"," 100 of 135 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","100","135","2","0"

Recall stripped straight from League. This game has new ideas, but the way it was implimented unfortunately sloppy. I recommend trying this game if you have a few free hours.\n\nI read the positive reviews for this. One guy's pro input was "It has a cute frog" So I guess ringing shiny silver keys in his face is just as effective.\n\nOne positive was right about one of the many things, stating "the announcer is annoying"\nThis is very true, the voice is so annoying that you will inherently cringe to the point of losing respect to who ever they hired to become the announcer for this game.\n\nFrom when I played first, the objective went something like this: Capture towers that give gold per second, and they deal higher damage than your abilities per hit on enemies that pass by, defeating the purpose of wondering around the map for extra objectives. All you have to do is get items and capture at least 1 tower. And as long as you play the strongest heroes, you will win every time.\nHowever, if you have even 1 bad teammate, you will lose unless the enemy is even worse.\n\nThis is technically worst Moba I've played so far, but there can still be little hope for it. As it is early release, the potential can still be raised from the developers reading constructive feedback, even though the unedited version of this review was needlessly harsh until Arbash (one of the developers) convinced me to give this game another whirl","September 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 111 of 158 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","111","158","8","4"

But at the start you gonna get crushed or you can get lucky and win because you get some good players in your team and you follow their pings.\n\nAbout matchmaking though.. It's really. really  poor right now, even worse than in most mobas, since you can get matched up with anybody, even though I seem to get very bad players most of the time, and I played something like 40 matches already, only in the ones I won I got someone decent, and I won 10.. 25% win ratio in 3v3v3v3, you think not THAT bad. But it feels bad to lose that many, while in most of these games I couldn't do anything about those loses.\nBut you can't blame the matchmaking since the game is in beta + it's player base is really small too. But I hope it won't discourage you to test this game and play for some time. It is a bit pay2win but with 15h I can say that my character isn't too badly equipped, but I also spammed this one character. The general level for character is seperate for each, so you need to start from the scrap if you want to try/main other character, which is pretty bad decision in my opinion.\n\nWell, generally it's a good moba for what it is, the improvements would be nice, but I still rate it 7/10 for the beta, and I can't wait for updates and launch of it.

The game stands out as unique in the MOBA genre by having 4 teams rather than 2, and it works quite well.  The game is designed around this 4 team system rather than having it thrown on just to make the game different, which means that the win conditions, map, and pacing of the game aren't as similar to standard MOBAs as you might expect.  Rather than winning by destroying a structure as in most MOBAs, your team needs to be the first to collect 30,000 gold.  Games are quite fast, lasting 15-20 minutes on average, and are fast paced all the way through.\n\nIn this game's case, it makes more sense to talk about the problems that the game has before talking about what it does right, as of some of the features available lessen the impact of many of the problems.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay to win\n\nA lot of the "p2w" features such as legendaries are earnable in-game, so think of those as pay to progress faster.  Better potion packs are purchasable with the premium currency, though you can get them in other ways and they are quite cheap.  The skins, however, provide a direct stat boost and are only purchasable with real money.  This is by far the worst part of the game; think of the game in its current state as a free trial where you have to pay $10 for a skin to get the full experience.  You cannot use the premium currency for these, you have to buy them through steam.  Hopefully a system is put in place to earn skins, even if it takes 100+ games.\n\n2. Poor tutorial\n\nThe tutorial is far shorter than it should be, and fails to cover all of the game's basics.  The game does have a wiki that has more information on how to play, but that should be in the tutorial to begin with.  Some pieces of information are even missing on the wiki, meaning that they cannot be found by searching online at the moment.  This is hopefully going to be changed seeing as the game is in early access, though.\n\n3. No matchmaking system\n\nThere is no MMR.  Everyone gets matched together, regardless of skill level.  This is a forgivable flaw, since it allows for great queue times despite the small playerbase, but if the game ever gets a large playerbase then it will become a more glaring problem.\n\n4. Lack of custom game support\n\nCurrently, you can only play games through matchmaking, and teams are limited to 3 players.  If you have a large group of friends playing the game, the only hope is to queue up in separate groups and hope to be put in the same game - the game would certainly benefit from having custom games for large groups of friends/stream viewers.\n\n\nPROS\n1. Extremely well executed 4 team gameplay\n\nNo other MOBA does this, at least not well.  Golden rush's 4 team system leads to a much faster pace than standard MOBAs.  Teams will often make temporary alliances against the first place team, and fights at the objectives can have as many as 12 players involved in an all-out brawl.  Split-second decision making is heavily rewarded, as catching another team out of position can secure you their tower or an ace if done properly.  The game is simply fun to play, which is what really matters.\n\n2. Premium currency can be earned in-game\n\nBeing in the top 100 at the end of a month gives you some premium currency, though the rewards are heavily skewed towards the top few getting a lifetime's supply and the rest getting relatively little.  You can get it in modest quantities from the daily reward (I've been given 300, $3 worth, in just under 2 weeks of daily spins).  You'll earn quite a bit of premium currency from essences. (purchasable for the standard currency of gold, essences can give you legendary gear, ~50-200 premium currency, temporary or permanent buffs, and potion sets)  Last but certainly not least, you can earn it just by winning games.  A win nets you 15, second place gives 10, and third gives 5.  You'll need just under 1500 for a full set of legendary gear, which is easily attainable without paying.\n\n3. Gear sets lend variation to the endgame\n\nThink of your equipment in this game as runes/masteries in league of legends.  They provide some flat stat increases in addition to special buffs such as -ressurection time or -damage taken from towers.  Legendary sets provide an ability on top of that, such as cc removal or cooldown reset.  Each class has 3 legendary abilities to choose from, and they will have a significant degree of impact on the game, much like summoner spells in league.  Since the gear is all attainable without paying, players will eventually be on an even playing field in that department.  Paying simply allows you to get this gear faster.\n\n4. Well designed bots\n\nTeammates disconnect at the start of a game?  No problem, the bots that they get replaced with have you covered.  This game has some solid AI, and the bots can even be controlled with pings to an extent.  While it would be nice to be able to micro the bot abilities as dota lets you do with disconnected players, the bots are sufficient as is.  I've won a couple games where both of my teammates disconnected at the start simply because the bots can be commanded to go to objectives where necessary and have decent enough AI in a fight to survive, provided you give them a few commands.\n\n5. Short matches\n\nThe matches, lasting only 15-20 minutes, are a welcome break from the hour+ timesink that many other MOBAs can be.\n\n\nAll in all, golden rush is actually a lot of fun.  I'd strongly recommend playing with a group of friends, as co-ordination is quite important.  Try it out in spite of the mixed reviews - you'll be plesantly surprised at how well-made the game is.","October 5, 2015","true","40.9"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","21","33","0","0"

As a matter of fact that is one of the best games ever!! I enjoy everything about it. You can choose from 6 heroes and enter one of the 2 arenas. The rules of the gameplay are very simple, however it does not make the game itself trivial. To the contrary - the game is incredibly complex because of its many variables (being mostly the players themselves). One always needs to look out, cause the situation in the arena is very dynamic and changes every minute. I love that you can loot artifacts in the game, although the green ones need to be unlocked afterwards. THis is not an issue for me. I either do so, or keep the yellow ones on.\nHowever I think that the chat needs further improvement. Not only does it look as if drawn by a child, it is somehow difficult to use.

If i move my mouse towards my monitorcorner of my main monitor (at the right side), i get to my second monitor (left side) with the mouse, which means that i cannot play properly.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juicytarball/recommended/385890/","Juicytarball","Tradeless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Juicytarball/","86 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nGolden Rush has a fair number of 'new' mechanics for a moba game. such as full rpg equipment drops in-game ranging from normal-set items. Obviously the 4 player mode is also a different change of pace from mainstream mobas, but lacks the same smooth charm as Deep Silver's Dead Island Epidemic.\n\nThe game is still quite unpolished. The skills of the current playable champions are subpar and unbalanced. Certain AoE ultimates that cast at the drop of a hat- .5, while other level 1 skills take upwards of ,75-1 to cast. Random creep camps spawn with elite mobs that aoe 2/3 of your life on death, makes farming a bit rediculous at times. Then there is the golden frog- a nice little addition- if only the pathing of it was fair. Some games the frog simlpy dances around one side of the map giving teams on that side a grossly  unfair gold advantage.\nTaking towers are also a pain, as every time an enemy sets foot into the cap circle, the capture is reset until the enemy leaves. It also either appears that the number of players do not affect capture speed or give such a negligible buff that teamates are better off defending the circle while 1 teamate captures. This makes capturing towers immensely difficult and annoying. Then there are the checkpoint portals, which would have been a neat addition, had it not been placed directly on top of creep camps, making them inaccesible most of the time. They are also randomly spawned, but certain locations also need rebalancing and give certain sides heavy advantage.\n\nThe UI needs work, a lot of work. There is guide or list of commands. You're left to figure everything out yourself, search the forums, or ask other players. Too bad 60% of the players don't speak english and the lobby chat doesn't appear to be working, but at least they do have an option to open the forums through the game.\n\nOverall it's a game that is attempting new things, but there are many kinks that still need to be worked out. If you're looking for something new or were a fan of DI: Epidemic, it might be worth your time to check out this game.\nI would recommend friends to try it themselves as it is a small download, but I wouldn't play it again until they start rebalancing the heroes and the checkpoint portals.","September 24, 2015","true","10.0"," 31 of 54 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","31","54","0","0"

I appreciate all the new things they're trying to do for MOBAs here (No lines of marching creeps, 4 teams, RPG level-ups, Diablo-style inventory management, etc), but the core gameplay still feels exactly the same as every other f2p MOBA. And the genre is stuffed to the brim already. New ideas are fantastic, but you have to have a good package to put those ideas in, and I'm not sure 'Golden Rush' is that package.\n\nAlso, the game is regrettably buggy, ugly, and has- at first impression, anyway --  a reprehensibly bad cash shop, including $400 of Steam DLC on day one. When a game like Infinite Crisis from a major studio with a HUGE IP (it's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Batman) fails and shuts down less than a year after it's launch, you have to understand that your customer base is scared about getting invested in any new game, let alone one launching with $400 of DLC on day one of early access.\n\nThe announcer is a pretty annoying tone and very repetitive. However, it's early access, so let's hope they smooth out some of the issues. It does play just fine, and I do like the music and the graphical *style*, even though the graphics themselves are kind of low quality. At least there's no entry fee, and it *is* fun, regardless of all the negatives I've listed. I could see a LOT of people having a lot of fun with this.","September 23, 2015","true","1.2"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","34","60","2","1"

Imagine League of Legends Dominion mode mixed with Diablo 3.  Items are PERMANENT and the matchmaking does not seem to take that into account.  Meaning, if you're starting out in this game, you have close to zero chance of winning since half the other players start with more health and damage than you'll have at max level.\nTo make matters worse, there are also four consumables that you basically must have to have any chance at victory and the best consumables are for a paid currency.  You do get a small amount of this currency after the game, but unless you placed first (highly unlikely until you've shelled out 500$ or played for 1000 hours) you won't get enough to refresh your consumables. This makes the game go in a horrible spiral of "Lost a match. Either I lose the next one too or drop 5$ for a chance to win. Lost again." and so on.\nThis game is clearly a money grabbing scheme shrouded with the concept of "well you 'can' just play the game forever and get everything." but that's not realistic when it's nigh impossible to actually contribute to a win without dropping a lot of money.","November 2, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Every game has it's downfalls but despite player feedback the developer has chosen to let players exploit this game that has potential in the interest of greed. Don't let people fool you this game is pay 2 win especially if you group with friends/people who buy black gems it's not even a slight advantage the difference is notiacable and you'll most likely find yourself losing every match unless your lucky enough to get the dragons chest or kill the frog or end up with 2 other people who are pay2win players, my advice is to not waste your time on this game it's not worth it if you sink alot of hours in the game you can at best get close to those who pay2win but obviously their going to be gaining black gems and gold more quicker so you will never catch up to them unless their hosptilized for a month.

While it is true that all the items in the game are earnable without paying, the chances of getting the legendary drops are very low.  This wouldn't be a problem, except that matchmaking will match you up against players with much more time played or money spent.  Oh and did I mention you can't use your hero's strongest ability unless you have a full legendary set of items?  The concept is great, but this game is about money not fun.  The tutorial leaves you with the controls to move around, but no information on gaining experience throughout a match, or the pros and cons of doing certain camps vs capping towers.  You just wander around and see what happens, because you don't have enough information to even formulate a strategy.  Expect to get dumpstered for your first 100 matches, unless you pay to win, and you can only use 3 of the heroes unless you want to spend $10 per hero.

There are too many things that skew the balance of the game. Not only that, this game is pay-to-win. You have 2 12-player maps, Dragons' Lair and Garden of Heroes, where you are divided into teams of 3 to complete a winning objective.\n\nIn Dragons' Lair, you have to collect 12 gold chests. I couldn't play this one as there weren't enough players.\nIn Garden of Heroes, you have to be the first to 30,000 gold. You capture Gold Towers, kill heroes and creeps and find gold chests to get the 30,000 gold.\n\nForbes Consult Ltd/Elyland (This is the developer) didn't really make a quality game. It was more of a Diablo grinder in the hope that you would get addicted and spend cash to improve your hero. I rate Elyland very lowly as a game developer.\n\nPROS\n1. Good First Effort\nIt looked good until I played it.\n\n2. Graphics\nNice hero models.\n\nCONS\n1. Pay To Win\nI captured screenshots of the exchange rate and it was totally ridiculous.\n\n2. Item Shop Level\nTo get higher level items, you have to upgrade your shop level. You'll start off at Shop Level 2 and it can keep on going higher. You have to get more Prestige to upgrade your shop. This skews the advantage to players who have a higher shop and better items.\n\n3. Abilities\nOnly 3 spells to press QWE. The ultimate is hidden and has to be unlocked by finding artifact items and transmuting them. This is extremely horrible.\n\n4. Inventory System\nSimilar to Diablo's slot system where you have a torso, weapons, head, neck and feet slots. I liked it at first since I thought it wasn't going to affect gameplay and was purely cosmetic. However, that wasn't the case.\n\nYour items give you stats, similar to Diablo, and since they can be bought with cash, you can buy an advantage. Thus, proof of pay-to-win.\n\nNEUTRAL\n1. Heroes\nOnly 6 heroes at the moment. First 3 are free, others are DLC. Okay to view, but they are very generic and bland. The mage looked interesting though.\n\nBarbarian\nRanger\nMage\nWitch (DLC)\nPaladin (DLC)\nAssasin (DLC)\n\nSUGGESTION\n1. Stop Using Pay-To-Win\nSell skins instead, stop using the pay-to-win model and focus on making the game fun.","October 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The main currency is BG which you get up to a maximum of 20 per game won. Each game has 4 teams and take around 20 minutes to play so IF you manage to win you get that BG which by the way isn't a useful amount at all. Everything you need to buy costs a hell of a lot of BG. A shop refresh costs 50BG!\n\nHeroes cost 12 dollars each.\n\nThe amount of money and time investment to be useful in this game is unbelieveably disproportionate. Saying that this game has potential but with its current currency model I would definitely not advise you to get in to it.\n\nMy suggestions for devs are to simply drop the pay to win model. Make BG something that you earn only through winning games but keep things like sings as a pay to use. Hell even keep the 'premium' monthly subscription but seriously everything costs far too much right now.","October 5, 2015","false","3.8"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

Then i try to back out to start a real match and all i can go is quot the game.

Even though a gave it a bad rating. Why? read on, there's actually a hidden (black) gem in this game; it's just not for free.\nLets get one thing straight, this game introduces a new kind of game mode which is actually quite refreshing. 4 teams? Genius.\nThe RPG element where you equip your character in between games is fun - you can either buy items in the shop when not in-game or you can find it during a game. Potions are also limited, which makes for strategic use.\n\nHowever, there are a few minor problems with this game. And when i say minor, i actually mean this is pay2win or being massochistic till you actually make it.\n\nLet me break it down.\n\nHeroes\nThere are 3 free heroes, the other 3 you can buy. The free heroes are far from bad, but the paid ones seem slightly better. Not a very big problem, because you can earn points to unlock said heroes. You earn points by winning or placing 2nd in a game.\n\nItems\nHere is the reall kicker, there are different item sets; normal, special and legendary (or something like that). You can either buy them in the shop or find them during your games. The ones you'll really be looking for are the green ones, the legendary items. If you buy those in the shop, black gems instead of gold. (Black Gems are the equivalent of real-life money.) But even if you find something green, you have to transmute it, at the cost of your black gems, to keep it.\nGreen items are significantly better than other items. Not only give they better bonusses, but when you own a complete set, it'll unlock another skill.\n\nThe problem\nAs stated before, if you have what it takes, you can unlock everything for free. And if you have the time and patience, i'm sure you can do it. But. But, if you want to stand a chance to unlock everything, you'll need to end up being 1st or 2nd very very often.\nIf the games where balanced, this would actually be a fun challenge. But they're not - unless you and your team have legendary gear, you stand no chance of winning, because there's always another team that does.\nAnd there it is, pay2win at its finest; deluding you into trying to do it all for free, only to frustrate you enough to give up and give in.","December 6, 2015","false","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are really nice and I like them. At the moment there are only six DIFFERENT champions, and THREE of them need to be bought with real money, leaving you with three champs that are underpowered compared to the paid ones. The announcer voice is a little weird and bugs out sometimes but is understandable, and the music track itself is really nice. From what I've seen it is a pay to win game at the moment... which is understandable, but still. It is definately not a bad game or a "crap" game as calling anyone's game bad, or crap is really hurtful to the people that have spent days or months working on it and probably trying their best. It's not one of the best games I've played, and I personally don't preffer it to other games at the moment, but I'd say to everyone to give it a try before coming to any conclusions.","January 7","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My friends and I were pretty good, so we won some games. But here came that trio. They had skin, they had stuff, they were prepared. Impossible to win. Really. On a map, we stacked chests, we were winning, then, they stole all our chests. Enough frustration to never play that game.","November 20, 2015","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
