THAT'S ♥♥♥♥ING RIGHT. IT INSTALLS A 3RD-PARTY KEYLOGGER FOR ANTI-CHEAT MEASURES. It's also nearly impossible to remove, unless you extremely specifically remove something from System32, then from Regedit, but i'm not even going to try.\nSecond: The company that made bought the rights to this game filled it up with weapons that you have to buy for... with real. world. money. Here's the best part: the weapons have better stats, but disappear from your inventory after a while. You know what that means? A Paytowin FPS.\nEven if they didn't have other stats, they're just retextures of other items, for example, you could have a normal smoke grenade, or get a colored one for an additional fee.\nPersonally, i only installed this to get the black rose in TF2, but found myself playing it more than expected. I uninstalled it several months ago, and just now found out about the keylogger.\nDON'T INSTALL THIS GAME. NOT EVEN FOR THE BLACK ROSE.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekipc/recommended/102700/","nekipc","Neki | Pup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nekipc/","139 products in account","PLEASE READ BELOW:\n\nThis isn't even a recommendation, but a warning. This game has been ruined by Aeria Games Entertainment and since the June update on 2013, the best and most of the fun guns are basically timed. You may wonder, what you mean timed? Well, before this June update, all guns can be bought permamently, either for in-game money or real money. But since the update, basically all the good guns are timed. Who would spend $15 USD for ONE gun that you can play with for 30 days? Yep, $15 USD for 30 DAYS. Not only that, the euros you earn in-game is freaking hard to earn and it won't be enough to cover the costs of buying attachments and even buying the gun again.\n\nWith how stupid Aeria Games Entertainment has become and basically ignored our pleas and said "Screw you, we know better than you silly gamers because we got the power" and thus, if you play the game today, you will see a lot more hackers than before and a lot of model bugs that ruins the gameplay easily. I feel sad that this game had to take this path, and it was going well too...\n\nUPDATE (June 7, 2015): After playing this game again after hearing about the permament guns returning, so far, the game is finally good with the permament euro guns now. Earning the in-game Euros are still kinda tedious but doing the events that Aeria has on their monthly events calander can help you earn the Euros (Such as playing x-map for 2 hours to earn 30k Euros for example). The game is still poorly optimized with FPS fluctuating between 90 FPS and max FPS (200) even when staring at the skies in India. Not only that, the networking of this game is still horrid, that even when shooting your enemy in the face, the shots will not register at all and you'll die instead. Game is still infested with players over 130 ping and that makes killing them more than a challenge already almost as their shots can kill you even behind cover when you peek out (due to the model delay on their screen where even if you just take a quick peek and you're already behind cover on your view, their view shows you completely exposed and you'll get killed from them). Permament guns are a great start and I thank the new PM for pushing this intiative. This game still has a lot of work to do (And at the same time, I would love a HD texture pack in this game. It looks awful at max settings).","August 29, 2013","true","424.0"," 358 of 397 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","358","397","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jazonvorhees/recommended/102700/","jazonvorhees","Heise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jazonvorhees/","217 products in account","First off, don't get fooled by my played hours, I've been playing it way before it was avaiable on steam but I didn't touch it since around 1.5 years. I would estimate that my played hours are somewhere around 3k, I've also participated in 2 tournaments. I would still love this game and recommend it to everyone and their grandma if Aeria wouldn't have messed up AVA like they did.\n\nAVA was a great game back when ijji published it, it had great potential. The maps are great, nothing to complain about here. You could buy Weapons, Grenades and Armor for ingame money. You would get money relatively slow, but once you hit 50-60k € you could buy a decent, permanent weapon and that's pretty much all you needed. You also need money to repair that weapon and buy parts for your weapon that need to get replaced regularly. Getting 50-60k could take up to 1-2 months, depending on how much you played. You could still spend real money on weapons in order to get them immediately. It still was not pay to win at all. The graphics were actually decent for a F2P game. You would encounter hackers from time to time, depending on whether there were any free hacks out there or not.\n\nEver since Aeria games took over things changed. Their biggest failure was the removal of permanent weapons, which ultimately made the game pay to win. You could only buy weapons for 30 days, then they expired. The price of a decent weapon was still around 50-60k, and I guess you already see that this is a huge problem. If you don't play 3-4 hours per day you won't be able to get 50-60k per month, that means you have to play with the standard weapons which are not entirely useless, but you would never beat someone who is on the same skill level as you with a standard weapon while he uses his expensive rifle. This also meant that old players will always have an advantage over new players, because they still have their permanent weapons.\n\nThe thing is, you may think that the publisher should have no influence on the content of the game, since they are only publishing, but not making it. Redduck is actually making the game, and they do so for several other regions such as Japan/China/Korea. All of those regions still have permanent weapons. In fact, Aeria denied to have anything to do with the change from permanent to timed weapons, but we actually contacted someone from Redduck who told us that they were against that change, but Aeria insisted.\n\nThe next point are hackers. Aeria implemented a new anti cheat engine that doesn't do its job at all. There were times where you would run into a hacker every 2-3 games. I can't tell you how it is in its current state tho, since I haven't played since quite some time.\n\nBy the way, Aeria introduced the "Tiered Spender" where you would get additional rewards depending on how much money you spend on their game. That's a nice concept, but the thing is that many of those additional rewards are permanent weapons, which is another aspect that makes it pay to win. Just to give you an idea on what you have to spend for a permanent weapon: In one of those tiered spenders you would get a permanent weapon starting at 7999 AP(a little more than 60€) and ending at 29999 AP(around 210€).\n\nThis is coming from someone who sometimes played this game all day long, played 2 tournaments and even made a few videos, my best montage got around 2k views, my overall best AVA video has around 10k views. If you have LOTS of money and can live with the fact that this game is pay to win then by all means, get it. I've been putting a decent amount of money into this game myself, and I would never do it again. Money still doesn't buy you skill, but it surely gives you an huge advantage. The next thing to consider are the hackers, everytime there are free hacks on a certain site AVA will be unplayable, and you might even get banned despite being a legitimate player (At one point hackers were able to use your name, which earned you lots of reports). And then I wish you good luck with Aerias automated support answers when you try to appeal a ban.\n\nIn the end it's up to you, but I can not recommend it in its current state.\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\nI still play a round or two every few months, and I was positively surprised when I played yesterday. Permanent guns are back, but they are really expensive and it surely will take you quite some time until you have enough money for a good gun. I think they need to either make the weapons cheaper, or give you the option to try them out for free before you buy them permanently. It now feels a lot like  back in the days when I still used to play this game all day long, but it still has a few pay to win elements. You are still not going to be able to beat a good player if you are average and spend a lot of money, but it's harder for beginners to get into the game, because it will take lots of time until you found the right gun, can afford it, and got enough money to buy armor as well. So it's not pay to win in the sense that bad players will defeat good players because they spent money, but good players who already have an advantage over new/bad players will have an even bigger advantage, so expect to have a hard time in the beginning if you plan on playing AVA.\n\nIf you are starting out I recommend you check out some guides because there are some things you should know that are not immediately obvious. Here is an (old) thread that's actually meant for players who want to play AVA competitively, but still is relevant and could give you some useful tips: http://www.aeriagames.com/forums/en/viewtopic.php?t=1885997\n\nHackers are still around, but it's not as bad as it used to be. It is understandable that they can't prevent hacking, because they can only react to hacks after they have been released for the most part. They surely are doing things to stop hackers before they actually get to do any damage, we have XIGNCODE after all. It's similar to bugs and glitches, if you programming a game or program you are going to try to avoid bugs, but you can't eliminate every single bug before they actually occured. The best you can do is try to prevent them to your best ability, so there will be as few bugs as possible.\n\nSo, I still don't recommend this game, altho it got a lot better. AVA is on a good path right now and maybe I will one day be able to recommend it again. I even think I'm going to play it more regularly from now on. Maybe I will give AVA a positive review one day, but today is not that day.","February 3, 2015","false","498.6"," 218 of 233 people (94%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","94","218","233","8","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllergenUK/recommended/102700/","AllergenUK","AllergeN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AllergenUK/","36 products in account","First of all, I have been playing this game for 5 years and I have witnessed the decline of this game.\n\nTo start of with the positives:\n\n+ Good graphics.\n+ Wide selection of weapons.\n+ Wide selection of maps and game modes.\n+ You used to be able to play this game for hours on end and not get bored.\n\n\nNow for the negatives:\n\n- The most cancerous community you can ever imagine. Full of 12 year olds who spam constantly and cry about pretty much everything, they single-handedly destroy this game without the following negatives being taken into account.\n\n- No functioning mute button which is really needed with this community.\n\n- Cheaters, they tend to come in waves when public cheats are released. Think cheaters in games such as CSGO are a problem? There is probably a 75% chance that you will face at least one cheater in the Matchmaking channel each game you queue up for - unfortunately that figure is not greatly exaggerated and that is only considering the kids running around with blatant wall hacks and 1 hit kill cheats.\n\n- Terrible publisher, they honestly do not give a fk about what the community wants unless it affects their income in a positive way. Sure, I understand it is a business, but not investing in a functioning anti-cheat, and instead focusing on the new tier-spender (a pay-to-win model) to satisfying those credit card whales is not the way to maintain a game.\n\n- Non-functioning anti-cheat, it's clearly not doing its job properly, and it gives random errors to legit players such as myself causing my game to crash for no reason.\n\n- Free-to-play, you'd think this would be a positive, but any kid that gets banned cheating can easily make a new account and farm it to a level in a few hours which allows them back into matchmaking.\n\n- Lag, this game has two servers to serve 6 continents; the EU server is supposed to support Europe, Africa and Asia whereas the NA server is supposed to support North America, South America and Oceania. It is not uncommon to face teams with 200+ pings on their closest server, and this game does not have an effective IP-restriction for those countries for which the license does not cover.\n\n- Hit registration, if you play CSGO you've probably heard the common quote 'Volvo pls fix 64 tick servers', and guess what, AVA is a significant downgrade on those servers, I believe somewhere in the region of 16 tick servers. This coupled with extreme laggers (the average ping in EU is probably around 70 and over 150 in NA) leads to countless frustrating encounters where you hit people first on your screen but end up dying behind a wall to a 300 ping BR.\n\n- RNG elements, in a competitive FPS, you would expect RNG (random number generation) to be kept to a minimum, but this game has shooting mechanics which revolve around RNG. First is bloom (how much the bullets spread while spraying) which is fine to have as RNG, but the other is damage - I have been in countless situations where I have head shot someone with a Para (one of the highest damage rifles which is usually a 1 hit head shot) but then die because he didn't die but sprayed 2 AK47 bullets (a lower damage rifle) into my stomach. In short, head shots are not rewarded sufficiently in this game.\n\n- Updates, in short, there is a lack of new content in new updates, it revolves around the pay-to-play whales where they are given new weapons to pay for (and at an obscene amount too).\n\n\nDo not waste your time with this game, the community is pure cancer, they are the most stupid people you will ever come across in your life. One last thing you should know is that even if this game has 5000 active players (which is a very high estimate), the most recent public cheat had something like 3500+ downloads if I recall correctly.","January 5","false","006.3"," 166 of 190 people (87%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","87","166","190","20","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hydrius/recommended/102700/","Hydrius","hi drius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hydrius/","16 products in account","Playing this game for about five years going on six and seeing the different changes that have affected this game makes me ashamed of how long I've played this game, I have developed many perspectives for this game. Playing when IJJI had the game was when A.V.A was at its prime, back when the guns actually took skill to use, and how the competitive scene was just being born. But ever since Aeria Games has taken over the game, they have reduced the game to its limit. Milking every dollar they could make, removal of permanent guns and the implementation of timed weapons. Poor server maintenance, etc. First off this game is a fast paced, intense action first person shooter. Second the guns in this game are well made considering most of the guns are based off real guns. (excluding Mega Capsules, Blue tickets, Red Tickets, Etc.) Third, the maps are OKAY, not well made, it's basic maps, some maps are so outdated that they don't even bother fixing the glitches/bugs in most of the maps. (but the maps that are played the most are updated a lot.) Fourth, this games graphics are fairly outdated for the North American version (UAVA), but seeing what the future updates will bring forth has made me more interested in this game. Such as HD textures. Currently in TAVA (Taiwan AVA) they have HD Textures which are considered a huge thing. Fifth, is the competitive scene, back in 2009-2012 the competitive scene was at its best. ieSF was a huge contribution to the competitive scene, they made the players strive towards perfection at this game. But sadly ieSF has stopped including A.V.A in their games list, because of lack of players in the competitive scene. Many of you might know Skadoodle of team iBuyPower from CS:GO, he has played this game professionally and has competed in ieSF, considering this is the first game that he ever played competitively and has achieved the most in. It is sad how the players quit because of the lack of competition because poor anti-cheat, poor game design, etc. All the things I have listed here are mostly cons of why I don't recommend this game. And now I will list the Pros of this game, there are a few dedicated players willing to do whatever it takes to make this game better and improve the amount of players, to have a permanent gun in this game, you had to be playing before they removed the permanent option. If you live near the servers, (Example: Canada) you will have at least 1 ping or 2 depending if you have good internet or not, this game is a really good game to help your aim. It's easy to warm up for games like CS:GO, it will make your aim better, you could have fun playing this game if you play with friends. That pretty much it. Aside from the fact that the people installing this game just for the "Black Rose" knife in TF2 and then uninstalling this game right after. It installs a keylogger into your system, but it does nothing. I promise you it doesn't do anything to your PC. But uninstalling it without playing it is stupid in my opinion. At least play the game, who knows? Maybe you will end up liking the game and maybe pay money to actually get permanent weapons. Overall my final verdict for this game is 6.5/10, it used to be 9/10 but ever since the heavy impacts it took, I don't recommend this game. Pay 2 Win, used to be balanced. Don't download unless you have played since 2011 and have perm guns.

The ad I saw on TV mentioned that I didn't need a great PC to run it and it had amazing graphics (close to Modern Warfare 2 graphics.). I've played it, loved it, made a lot of friends. The game was great.\n\nHowever, there was a small problem. The publishers never gave a ♥♥♥♥. The original publisher, ijji, tried to control the hacking situation (and failed), but they still kept the game Free2Play and not Pay2Win.\n\nFast forward a few years, Aeria Games is the new publisher. If you know Aeria Games, you know how ♥♥♥♥ed you are if you play their games. Aeria is now trying to milk as much money as they can from the players (which they call Customers and not Players). They removed the Key Features of the game: the graphics were downgraged (so the game kinda looks like ♥♥♥♥ now), they removed some ingame currencies (and replaced them with real money currencies), they downgraded the servers, they somehow made the game lag on every computer (even if you've got 4 GTX 1080 TI's, you won't run it without constant FPS drops) and they let the Hacking situation explode (note that the influx of cheaters was when they removed the key features of the game, it was the player's way to protest).\n\nThis was a great game, I've invested around 2000 hours on multiple accounts, and it's sad to see how the game was brutally murdered by a company that doesn't care about it.\nThis game will soon join the graveyard of games that Aeria Games bought, exploited and closed.","May 18","false","90.9"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","51","52","5","6"

Introduced more and more overpowered weapons to the game which you could only obtain with Aeria Points, also P2W\n\n- There were petitions against timed weapons and overpowered sh^t, petinions which reached over 50% of the playerbase back then but they simply ignored it.\n\n- Aeria lost A LOT of players, A LOT... seriously. There were around 2-5K steam players (correct me if Im wrong, I dont remember exactly) back in, what was it? 2012 or something. When Aeria decided to destroy this game their playerbase dropped to about 500 steam players, and now Im not counting those who played through the aeria client, but Im sure the pattern was the same.\n\n- So here we are, 2015.

Upon starting up, the framerate was great, and the tutorial was good, which made me have high hopes. I have to play an online match to get my Black Rose. After playing the match I want to kill myself. I am instantly met with like 30 bots on my team I was like (not a good sign), and one actual player. The enemies 30 bots and two players come up to assault us, and it is the biggest ♥♥♥♥♥torm I have ever experienced. To sum it up, its like a Clash of Clans attack, where the enemy, instead of having defenses, has the same amount of troops you do. And everything dies in one hit. Sound fun yet?

This game may be pay to win in some cases, but the new update has changed that perspective, making everybody in the game have the most overpowered guns for free with little-no effort.

Many experienced players who will crush noobs,\n-There are no more beginner rooms, can be offputting for beginners,\n-Cpu heavy,\n-Half of the players use AP weapons, which seems unfair,\n-Many glitches when playing coop,\n-Aeria will close down your account if you are inactive for too long ( a year I think )\n\n\nOther :\n-For some reason some of the local files may appear as viruses through your antivirus,\n-The game takes ages to load even though I have a decent enough rig\n\nOverall, AVA is a good FPS, I find that the gameplay is great but i also think that Aeria could make much better by not making it a pay to win ...\n\n7/10","August 23, 2015","true","277.9"," 51 of 70 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","51","70","4","2"

Anyway games like PlanetSide 2 are even worse for being strict on weapons, it is so P2W. AVA is not P2W, and even if you want to pay it's not expensive.\n\nFor people  who haven't played AVA and are thinking about it, I highly recommend it. AVA is extremely lightweight for such a seemingly heavy game, so it is good for most non-gaming computers too, I used to play it all the time on a rubbish computer. I'ts programming is good and very enjoyable to play, it's one of the only first-person shooter games where I get 200+FPS. I love AVA it's a pure classic, I highly recommend it. Convoy Runaway is my favourite mode on it, and there are so many different maps and modes there is something for everyone to enjoy...\n\nBottom line AVA is a great game, it should be respected and given better consideration big time. I enjoy this game more than PlanetSide 2, PlanetSide 2 is too focused on one game mode of map domination, when u just want really fun arcade kill em up modes AVA is for you. I especially like it A LOT more than TF2, personally I really dislike TF2.\n\nRate this review up so that everyone can actually see a fair and original review instead of the hundreds of TF2 players who all write EXACTLY the same thing! e.g. 1 install 2. get knife for tf2, 3 uninstall... lololol","April 1, 2015","true","26.4"," 195 of 320 people (61%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","61","195","320","33","12"

I understand it's a pay-to-win but the game is fun and it's free. The pay-to-win isn't that noticable when a lot of the pay to win players can't play as well as the free users, you can't pay for skill to aim down a gun. You earn a lot of things free for just playing the game and honestly there hasn't been a game so far where I've gotten mad about people's 'OP guns". The matches have been pretty even, even with people having paid for guns on the other team. Don't let the reviews fool you, it's a fun game to get into and you don't have to spend money to be good at it. The free guns are fine and they give you tons of things for just playing, for a limited time, but still giving you it. Most of my inventory right now is all things preminum without spending anything or tickets because the game just gave it to me for playing it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperCraig64/recommended/102700/","SuperCraig64","SuperCraig64 *Vacation*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SuperCraig64/","58 products in account","Warning: this review has been re-uploaded intentionally to not only update new info, but to remove previous ratings due to the review's harsh judgement. I will be reviewing this on my own opinions, although some other opinions are quite the same as mine. Also, I have only played this game for at least a several hours, and has been a long time since then. As a result, the review may not be accurate. Regardless, you've been warned.\n\nA.V.A - Alliance of Valiant Arms is a First-Person Shooter where you choose from one of many classes and..well..kill people. Sound familiar? If many answered Call of Duty, Team Fortress 2, or even Counter Strike, you'd likely be here because it looked cool and all. "Not all is what it seems."\n\nOkay, before we dip ourselves into the bad parts of this pool, let's go over the good things I have to say of the game.\n\n+ Despite me not liking the artwork this game displays on the store or even the logo, the graphics in this game are pretty good, if not decent. And I must say a lot of effort was put into making the game look nice.\n\n+ The game functions well, and I haven't suffered a single crash.\n\n+ Hackers about? Not likely. Despite all what people said about "this game is infested with lifeless hackers!", I am still having a legitimate experience without suffering any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t such as aimbots, godmode, or any cheats actually. So either they all were ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at some snipers doing some 360 no-scopes, or just wanted to start some rumors on this already down-hill of a game. So in short, not many hackers. That's a plus.\n\nNow, let's list some of the major issues this game has.\n\n- This game is very Pay-to-Play influenced. Instead of selling skins and all, there are actual weapons being sold as micro-transactions which aren't micro at all. Do you expect me to pay 50$ for a single pack of weapons from a Free-to-Play game? No, I wouldn't. It's worse as it encourages people to put money into the game, most recently with the "Welcome Pack 2016" update.\n\n- The next problem is one people always complain about. People from Team Fortress 2 flock to this game in order to obtain a Spy knife reskin known as "The Black Rose", a good looking one at that, and was pretty cool before Tough Break came along. To obtain this knife, you simply had to get an achievement in-game. Simple, right? Well, this is where the second flaw comes into play. For some reason..and I mean for some reason, the developers thought it was a good idea to prevent you from obtaining any achievements until you beat the entire tutorial. You know what that means? You have to sit through an hour or two learning of the game's way of school. And no, not just the basic gameplay. I literally mean everything. Only then are you qualified to obtain achievements and obtain "The Black Rose". At least, in my experience. When I completed my first round, nothing. However as soon as a beat the tutorial completely, bang! Three achievements, only one was the tutorial while the other three was from that previous match. As of me last playing in early 2015, there has yet to be a fix for it other than playing the tutorial like intended.\n\n- The holy grail to it all is the game's installment. It's files are quite..cruel to other files. In the game's installment, an "anti-cheat" program is installed that instantly deletes any and all files that the program finds either interfering with the game, and/or because it can. Most cases it was because it could. Why? My Team Fortress 2 graphics looked like they came straight from a missing textured mess from Garry's Mod, and I had to re-install the entire game to fix it. Again, this was in my experience. Just uninstall A.V.A once you get what you want from it.\n\nNow with all the major issues out of the way, let's tackle the lesser problem I have with the game.\n\n* The game when launched by steam, launches it's own launcher. It's a small gripe I have. There isn't any real settings to change in said launcher last time I launched it besides maybe screen sizes or fullscreen toggle.\n\n\nOverall, I don't really like this game. While this is a bad game, it isn't that bad as people say. The gameplay is decent and the graphics look decent. Just everything is decently good, until the encouragement of "Pay-to-Play" and bad design choices on terms of coding that made this game fall to the mixed status it is in now.","May 4","false","2.1"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Next, you're in the Public Channel without level limits; the territory of people who dedicate serious time and real money. Later on, trying to earn game money is almost pointless, so you'll have to put in real money if you want to buy stuff and stay competitive. It'd be better if there were more level specific Channels like 1-15; 1-20; etc. Be prepared to get insta-killed... a lot.\nYou will run into hackers. If you press ESC during a game, it shows three things: disconnect; cancel; REPORT HACKER. That shows how much of an issue it is.\nAuto Balance is terrible. It balances the amount of players, but not individual scores.\nUnrelated, but there was one time where some fool had an AK that kills you with only one shot... in the leg.

Anyway games like PlanetSide 2 are even worse for being strict on weapons, it is so P2W. AVA is not P2W, and even if you want to pay it's not expensive.\n\nFor people who haven't played AVA and are thinking about it, I highly recommend it. AVA is extremely lightweight for such a seemingly heavy game, so it is good for most non-gaming computers too, I used to play it all the time on a rubbish computer. I'ts programming is good and very enjoyable to play, it's one of the only first-person shooter games where I get 200+FPS. I love AVA it's a pure classic, I highly recommend it. Convoy Runaway is my favourite mode on it, and there are so many different maps and modes there is something for everyone to enjoy...\n\nBottom line AVA is a great game, it should be respected and given better consideration big time. I enjoy this game more than PlanetSide 2, PlanetSide 2 is too focused on one game mode of map domination, when u just want really fun arcade kill em up modes AVA is for you. I especially like it A LOT more than TF2, personally I really dislike TF2.\n\nRate this review up so that everyone can actually see a fair and original review instead of the hundreds of TF2 players who all write EXACTLY the same thing! e.g. 1 install 2. get knife for tf2, 3 uninstall... lololol","June 26, 2015","true","0.7"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","21","34","3","0"

By spending an average amount, you get so much stuff, it will easily over-power anyone who has payed nothing. The sniper rifles are extremely cheap. When using a sniper rifle, once a shot is fired, you can switch to another weapon and then switch back by quickly hitting the q button twice, its like an OP DMR that can one shot anyone under any circumstances. It takes too much time to rank up, and you cannot purchase anything until Rank 8. This will have you stuck with default items for ages.  And the ONE thing that made me quit this game is none other than the god forsaken time trails!!! They suck, they are impractical, and just ruins your day when all of your weapons suddenly dissapear. Otherwise, the game is decent in every other perspective. The graphics are nice, controls are smooth, maps and gamemodes are acceptable and even unique in some cases, like Escape (Though Zombie modes suck). Without those, the only thing it has running for it is that its not Combat Arms.","October 7, 2014","false","34.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Weapons are still unbalanced, just like some of the free guns are. Lag is much more noticable with full ~1 second delays. Still fun to play casually though I wouldn't reccomend getting competitive since that requires good servers(lol) and lots of $$.\n\nEdit: So in a recent patch permanent guns have made a return (though they never should've left in the first place). This means new players will have access to the game's top tier guns for free immediately which is a pretty good thing. The game could still use some major weapon balancing and should provide easier means of obtaining armor. Servers aren't the best but its not too big of an issue.\n\nThe game was real fun when it was first founded, there were permanent weapons that could be bought with ingame currency. Gameplay was pretty balanced and didn't have all the pay2win stuff it did now after being hosted by a new company (aeria). I wouldn't recommend playing this anymore as it really requires you to pay in order to keep up with others. Even if you could afford spending money on this game, I still think it would be a waste and that money could be better spent on other games worth your time.","November 27, 2014","true","639.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Theres a reason why other newer F2P FPS games died out, like Soldier Front 2, and Fear online, the gun play is just bad in both. In my opinion AvA has one of the most solid shooting mechanics in any F2P FPS game to date. Some may argue this is not the case, but with the rampant hackers, awful community, why stick around in AvA? AvA has come a long way since beta, it even changed publishers (for the worse, rest in peace Ijji), but is still a fun game to play once in a while. The hit detection is solid, and the lag compensation is well coded. One of my favorite gamemodes is escort, which is one of the most innovative and fun gamemodes\n\n7/10","April 3","true","104.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

And skill is an important factor. So basically no. Unless you see some uber cashers who got rare weapons.\n\n-Are there many hackers out there?\nI see not many hackers. Even tho everyone in the lobby is spamming "prefire haxx" "thro the smoke! Haaaaacjjerrrr" Don't believe them.. Just some butthurt flamers.\n\n-Is it better than CS:GO?\nJust try it. Get into it and see for yourself. Thats a matter of opinion.\n\n-Do I get a virus by downloading the game?\nNope. The andicheat software may cause false alarm for Norton or some other stupid antiviruses. But c-mon. Which gamer uses Norton.\n\nFor more questions, ask in the comments.\n\n*UPDATE\nRecently, there are alot of hackers in AVA MatchMaking. Makes it unplayable.

It is easily not worth the Black Rose and this game is literally more difficult to look at then to play. This is the worst example of a shooter I have seen in a long time; It is Pay2Win, begs you to buy its overpriced ingame credits to buy weapon reskins and extremely overpowered buffs and weapons and steals from other bad games like Call of Duty. The major design flaw in this game is the concept itself, and Valve should feel ashamed to link a Team Fortress 2 promotion to this pile of raw waste. I can see the appeal this game would have to some people with a far below average IQ, but it doesn't hold up to people that want to actually have fun with their games. The added fact that this game uses a far inferior cheat protection system that allows hackers in every server and servers that openly boast "HACKERS PLAY HERE" just makes it even worse. Waste of time, 0/10. Don't bother playing.","July 15, 2013","false","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spazman3000/recommended/102700/","spazman3000","Spaz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spazman3000/","57 products in account","One of the Worst games I have ever played, the gameplay is repetative and offers nothing diffrent from your normal fps. Scernarios especially are repetative has you usally just move through area to area shooting AI enemys which are so stupid they just charge your postition and get mowed down over and over till you find your objective or get to the end of the area. Sure occasinaly you get a guy armed with an rpg who just stands still and fires it over and over at you but that's it AI wise. To say this game has coop is insulting, it was so repetative that I didn't even want to play more than 1 macth of the coop, If i want good coop I would go play Payday 2 sure it costs money to buy it but at least it works with no problems and is fun. Did I mention I had to reboot the game TWICE after booting it up once just to get into 1 macth...1 ♥♥♥♥ING macth. So that's what 3 times I had to boot the game up just to get into 1 macth. Not to mention the so called charecter customization is bare bones has hell only allowing you to choose a face for your guy, which you won't even ♥♥♥♥ing see ever, since the game is played in First Person. Hell even when looking at other peolpes charecters you cna barely see they face anyway, not to mention most of them look the same, most of the faces look the SAME. I played this game for less than 20 minutes and I already don't wish to ever play this game again. Please do yourself a favor and dont even download this piece of ♥♥♥♥ attempt at making a game. The coop is repetative has hell, you will often find yourself doing the same thing over and over in very similiar looking areas making you wonder if you went in a circle or if your going backwards because you cant tell it all looks the same. The Competative multiplayer sucks ♥♥♥, and the game lags like hell and no the lag was not me I turned my settings down to low just to see if it was me, and I still lagged like ♥♥♥♥. With all that and barebones "Charecter Customizeation" this game even if its free to play is not worth downloading, and if you spent any money on this game I feel sorry for you it really wasn't worth it. Anyway if I were to give this game a rating it would be a 1/10 but after some really ♥♥♥♥ing hard thought I am gonna give it a 2/10 for at least looking like its trying to be a good game. It looks like its actually trying it really does, but it just is so bad and so repatative that I don't see myself or many over peolpe playing this game for more than a few minutes.\nSummary\nGood:Free to play\nBad: Repetative Coop Missons, Lag out the ♥♥♥, Charecter Customizing is barebones, Competive Multiplaye itself offers nothing new and gets repetative, Is horrandusly boring and Repetative compared to other coop games, Game itself seems to not offer anything new.","November 30, 2013","false","0.9"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","2"

That means that you're paying real-life money for in-game items that quickly expire.\nNow, a few years back when the game was still with it's original company, Ijji, I think, there was very few microtransactions and those that did exist didn't give paying players upper hands against those that didn't.\nAside from all that, the game is genuienly fun to play, and can take a good amount of skill to compete with noobs that spent $20 for the most overpowered gun in the game, only for it to last 30 days.\nLastly, the game installs a (I've heard of it referred to as a rootkit?) hacking-prevention program that stays on your stystem even after deleting the game, called GameGuard. You have to rummage through your system 32 or 64 files to delete it, and that's crossing the line.\nI remember a time where I enjoyed this game, enjoyed ranking, playing, and saving up in game currency for a shiny new assault rifle.\nYou get a TF2 knife.

I don't think much has changed. I haven't seen the hackers people are complaining about. The hitreg is the same as it ever was. The shop.. I can see why people would be miffed, but at the same time, I like the idea of it. You're not just stuck with a bad weapon (else reselling it for only a fraction of the original price) anymore after paying full price for permanent. At the same time you're not stuck with a -good- weapon because permanent exists only for select guns, so there's that. But the game keeps throwing good timed guns at me for free and supply crates are pretty easy to get, so that part is pretty cool.\n\nI like the idea behind the tickets in the capsule shop, but it only streamlines the process of getting premium guns.. it doesn't make it easier. 3/4 years on I still want a VSS Katana, and I'm no closer. This part bothers me.\n\nBut yeah. If you can look past these things, you do have a good game. A game that I will continue to play.

In fact, before I downloaded the game via steam, I had logged over 1000 hours playing via the game launcher. But that was four years ago. In the past two years, it has been completely demolished into one of the most horrible cash-hounding games in history by a takeover from a terrible game host named Aeria Games. All this company does is try to profit in any way possible, whether it be from making originially permanent guns timed, shoving horrendous AP offers in your face, or trying to create a shop system where it is impossible to play the game without buying AP. In a recent update, every single gun in the shop is timed if you wish to play with in-game currency, meaning that you will farm for hours upon hours on end and save every single euro just to see your gun quickly expire until you spend 20$ of real cash for each new gun. The bottom line is, this game was made into an intrinsic pay to play game by an extremely greedy developer.

Now, these weapons are almost twice as expensive in some cases as they were before Aeria Games took over, but at least you don't have to spend any real money. I would recommend playing this game for the gunplay and the community, learning the recoil patterns and unique feel of each distinct gun can be a lot of fun. It is definitely not a spray and pray game like Call of Duty, and the ranks, progression, and supply points (for in-game currency) add a level of progression that provides an incentive to keep you playing that Counter-Strike does not have. However, I would still not spend any real money on this game, as every cash offer is a major rip-off.","December 23, 2013","true","166.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Every gun in the shop is now permanent and the hacker problem is mostly solved. The servers are still pretty bad, but the community did improve. The game itself is different from other games, so I would give it a try.\n\n\nPrevious Review:\nAVA has become a pay to win game and I do not recommend it to new starters. I mean there are good permanent guns out there, but half the weapon shop is full of timed weapons. If you're willing to spend hundreds of dollars into this game than go for it, but in my opinion it's not worth your time and money. I would rather play other fps games like CS:GO. If you're not willing to spend money on any games then be my guest, play AVA. If you're willing to pay at least 20 dollars into this game, just buy CS:GO. The community is horrible and hating, the games infested with hackers (hacking rates increases when Aeria does something wrong), and the servers are trash. Why start and pay money in this game if you can just buy another game and not waste your time. I hope this review helped you see another perspective in this game.

Launched in 2007 in Korea, and published in NA/EU in 2009, A.V.A has remained a graphical beast that trumps all F2P comeptitors! Utilizing the Unreal Engine 2.5, A.V.A delivers a unique style of game play, along with brisk graphical detail.\n\nCasual and competitive players will find a home in this action packed first person shooter! From Battle Gear: Beginz, to crazed zombies, and other fun game modes, you and your friends will enjoy every moment played! Tons of unique weapon skins, and dozens of gear to customize your characters appearance, and personality!\n\nFor those competitive minded players, A.V.A offers its own built-in matchmaking and ranking system, called the Clan Championships. Solo Que, and Team Que, all with rated play based on RP! Get your team of 5, or brigade your own path to the top of the rankings! Rewards, and plenty of opportunities await the strongest of competitors!\n\nThird-party support is also strong with the likes of fabled host, ESL, and A.V.A-unique CGO! Check both these wonderful leagues out for the best of the best competition! If that's still enough there's also the international IeSF and AIC events once a year, where teams from both NA, and EU are flown out for free to compete in international tournaments in Korea, Japan, and China!\n\nDozens of features are included in the game, ranging from first person spectate, practice rooms, spectator mode, and tons of other options to provide you with the best gaming experience possible!\n\nThere are a range of negatives, that detract from the game itself however! All guns are timed for 30 days at outrageous prices ($20 for 30-Days each month). The value in spending money in A.V.A is non-existent. There's a large disparity between the good guns, and the bad guns. Do not spend money in A.V.A in its current state! Spend it elsewhere!\n\nF2P FPS: 8/10\nFPS: 7/10","November 25, 2013","true","136.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Let me tell you about this game.\n1. It's older than you ( 8 years old ) so don't complain about graphics, they are still fantastic\n2.

It's not sh*t, you are.\nI have played this game since WAY before it was on steam, I noticed it was on steam, it's a ton less popular than it used to be, but you can get almost any gun in the game if you have some still, plus you get the IRL money guns by ranking up.\nWanna complain about P2W? No, don't, this used to be a TON worse... plus you can be a GOD in the game without paying ANYTHING.

Big mistake! This game made me almost cry out of frustration and disgust. It is horrible and i want nothing to do with it ever again.  I am glad that i won the first game i ever played on it so that i never have to play it again.\nwhen  you open it you are welcomed by a windowed launcher that stops responding every 10 seconds. It´s almost like the computer wants nothing to do with it. My antivirus protection popped up and told me it looked suspicious and asked me if i was ok with it running on the computer or if it should terminate it.\nI can tell you that the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ too! I laughed my way throught this experience whilst almost crying because its so horrible. How can you actually make something this broken and ♥♥♥♥♥♥!? The only reason anyone would want to play it is because you might get a weapon for another game, unless you kill yourself before winning a game that is.\n\nWarning!

Fun enough to keep me going for 100+ hours, admittedly.\nYet there's better games to spend your time on, especially if you're playing solo - A.V.A was only fun to me because I played it with 2-3 friends most of the time.","November 25, 2014","false","109.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This one is actuly updated and 100% freeer. (edit) Its slipped a lot since then, its overdone the p2w thing, and the overall game quality has slipped. no longer reccomending, not worth the download anymore. Though if you download for the tf2 knife its worth trying to see if you like it for a short period but dont waste long on it and also i suspect they have powered down the servers as the game is generally more laggy and slower, also when aeria took over instead of fixing a glitch they just closed the map as it was a co-op level and the glitch allowed people to get an item as a f2p player that they intended only p2p players to be able to get, thats the ethos aeria has money. The game overall now feels (the europe+usa version at least) that it is only still running to squeeze the remaining money out of the remaining core players.\n\nALSO SOME ADVICE: If you have ever installed this game then uninstalled and have no intent of playing again or playing another game that uses game guard, the games anti-cheat engine, which is ironically a minor security threat dosent uninstall, if a hacker tried to get into your pc they could make it a threat so i would advise googling how to propery uninstall gameguard. While you have the game installed this is not a problem because it will update, but once the game is uninstalled it will not update if new security risks emerge so could become a problem.\n\nEdit, ava has recently been acuired by a new company that bought areia, will see if anything changes and update this review if any significant changes come to my attention.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheInspektor/recommended/102700/","TheInspektor","The Inspektør","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheInspektor/","6 products in account","I've played this game since its IJJI days (the original publisher), and I still continue to play now, even thought IJJI has been bought by Aeria Games.\n\nAnyway, this game used to get a lot of flak for being "P2W" and for being dead because Aeria Games removed all the permanent weapons. That's about half-true now.\n\nWith the latest patch, Aeria Games has FINALLY brought back permanent weapons to the Euro Shop, meaning that by playing the game, you can earn Euros (which is the in-game currency) which you can use to purchase weapons off the Euro Shop. Once you buy one, it's yours. Forever. No renting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Once you purchase a gun, you are able to purchase mods for it (make it more accurate, a higher rate of fire, etc.) for Euros as well, which degrade with use along with the gun. You can, however, repair your guns with Euros and re-purchase mods if they break/wear down.\n\nEuros are fairly easy to get as a new player. Every day you log into the game, you can complete daily missions for a game mode of your choice, which reward you upon completion. (Also, there are events hosted every once in a while, such as "Play *some map* for *some amount of time* and receive *some Euros*.")\n\nNow to the ugly side of the game.\n\nHackers are a bit common, since this game uses the XIGNCODE3 anti-cheat, which is horrible IMO. (There is an in-game report button you can use, and there is also a "report form" on the official A.V.A. website you can submit to Aeria when you want to report someone)\n\nThis game is nowhere near as P2W as it used to be, given that Aeria is mainly releasing re-skins of existing weapons.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend you give this game a try.\n\nI still enjoy it, and I hope you do as well.\n\n\nP.S. There is a Welcome Package you can purchase for A.V.A. from the official game website for 9 AP, which is equivalent to 9 cents. This package gives you 4 permanent guns (a good sniper, a good SMG, a decent assault rifle, and DUAL PISTOLS), 3 timed guns, EXP and Euro increase, armor, and timed characters (which have a different look and give you a bit more EXP when used).\n\nAgain, the Welcome Package is 9 CENTS. (You can only receive it if you are spending AP with Aeria Games for the FIRST time. There is a way to get AP for free, and that's by watching videos, doing surveys, etc. I myself recommend watching the videos and tabbing out, as it's the easiest way to get free AP.)","September 8, 2011","true","362.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Valance of Arms is a nice typical FPS game but only takes up a little memory which is very nice. All the classes are fun and to some new comers out there, (sniper is op 1 shot 1 kill ^.- ) but ill try to review the classes a little  bit. For starter weapons, i find them awesome considerind the starter smg comes with red dot scope as long with a forgrip/light. The rifleman class starter is an fn2000 with a nice scope too. as for the sniper. like i said looks cool and op. overall a very fun game and it lets you know what games are beginner or not which is very helpful and i hope this review is too! anyways have fun playing and GET THE DA$% GAME!!!!

I am glad that i won the first game i ever played on it so that i never have to play it again.\nwhen  you open it you are welcomed by a windowed launcher that stops responding every 10 seconds. It´s almost like the computer wants nothing to do with it. My antivirus protection popped up and told me it looked suspicious and asked me if i was ok with it running on the computer or if it should terminate it.\nI can tell you that the gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ too! I laughed my way throught this experience whilst almost crying because its so horrible. How can you actually make something this broken and ♥♥♥♥♥♥!? The only reason anyone would want to play it is because you might get a weapon for another game, unless you kill yourself before winning a game that is.\n\nWarning!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jankanpo/recommended/102700/","jankanpo","Fox! ϡpeace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jankanpo/","597 products in account","This game is surprisingly good for a free FPS game!\n\nI originally downloaded it a few months ago to get the black rose spy knife thing from getting the first achievement, but the game was broken for me, so I couldn't play it until they finally fixed the installer.  I played this all morning and had a blast!  The combat feels more like a watered-down Call of Duty game, but it's not like you paid anything to play it!  I didn't really notice any lag, even though I had 220+ ms ping since I was playing at 4 AM my time, which meant I was automatically connected to European servers.  Sniping was really fun, and I'd say it ranks up to stomping 1.6 pubbers, since people panic when there's an actual sniper that can aim!\n\nThere's basically 3 classes - Point, Rifle, and Sniper.  The point character gets the heavier weaponry, and is meant to be the squad leader-type (heading the front).  Rifle guy is the 'CS' archetype since he has the M4A1 and AK47 weapons.  The Sniper is basically a Scout-user with AWP-sounds.  It takes 2-3 hits to kill anyone (depending on if they bought armor), although a headshot is a one-hit kill.  There's a cash shop thing inside the game, but I don't think anyone spends actual money on a game like this, so there really isn't a downside if you only spend in-game credits over actual cash.  You can buy new grenades (like flashbangs!) in the shop, but everything has a durability price so that you keep playing forever.  None of the items for me expired in the several hours I spent testing this game out.\n\nThere are about 7 game types, I think, ranging from Deathmatch style to L4D-types.  Obviously there's also CT vs Terrorists bomb defusal game-type as well as a horde mode game-type.  The robot horde mode was the first thing I played, and it actually impressed me when you actually got to the boss LOL.  I thought it was easy as heck, until my party of 4 reached the boss, and it was a gigantic mech straight out of something like Vanquish.\n\nThe regular DM maps are pretty bland, but it's still fun to play in!  It's a free game, so I can't really complain because it was actually really fun to play even though I had no idea what I was doing.  It's a pretty easy game, but if you and your friends have nothing better to do and want to play an FPS game, you might as well give this thing a shot since it's free.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is a fun Call of Duty/Counter-Strike/Left4Dead clone, but free2play and has a non-intrusive cash shop to actual gameplay.  Play it if you're bored and feel like dicking around in another FPS game~","January 20, 2013","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Aeria even stooped as far as to change one of the features that made this game good: permanent weapons. This feature set the game above most if not all other F2P FPS games out there, and Aeria took this away because of greed.\n\nOverall, I'd rate this game 9/11, would Jihad again.\n\nEDIT:\n\nThey brought back permanent weapons.

Shame on you....\n\nAt the moment I do not reccommend this game mainly because you will lose so much money from it. It may say Free to Play, but it's one of the biggest Pay 2 Win scams out there. Before 2013, this game was amazing. Now, it's a pile of microtransaction s**t."\n\nEDIT: The changes and implementations Aeria Games has made in the time I made this review have improved the game immensely. I do recommend it now because so many pay to win aspects have been removed entirely. Permanent weapons are back, and almost any gun you can think of can be purchased without spending money. Even though they encourage you to spend money, it is not necessary. Even if one does spend money, it does not necessarily further one's "pay2win" bonuses.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/charlescj56/recommended/102700/","charlescj56","Mr. Nice Guy O'RLY?","http://steamcommunity.com/id/charlescj56/","262 products in account","This is by far the best free-to-play games I've ever played. I played this back in 2010-11 was around the first time I played it, I didn't understand the game all that well and everything like that so I stopped playing it for a long long time. I watched my friend play this game and I thought I'd give it a shot and it's not actually one of those average pay to win games. Hell lol I've played 19 hours in the past two weeks and the second weeks just getting started lol. I'm actually probably gonna go play some after I finish writing this but anyway. The only problem I have with this game is when you spend money on it, which I've spent maybe $15 when you purchase something you may or may not get it. Which if you don't you are supposed to contact them which I did Sunday and today is now Tuesday and I have not gotten a response yet. That's with most average games you won't hear a response until probably two weeks? I'll try to update this and let you all know when I get a response and how the service was. In my opinion I would say that you would not have to spend money on this game what so ever, it's a fantastic game itself. What I mean by this is you can earn AP which is what you can spend and earn the credits it's called AP (Aeria Points) but anyway you can earn that by doing surveys... I know it sounds hard but you can actually do them quiet easy if you know what you're doing. You can earn about 60-100 AP for each survey for free?? I've done it... It works yes. Now back to you don't necessarily have to spend money on this game because when you play the game modes it doesn't matter which one but you earn euro which you can spend to buy weapons, equipment, ect. PLUS in some of the game modes not all of them they give you a free loot box reward I would call it. You can open it right after the match and it can give you grenades, pistols, armor, ect. I actually got lucky off one of those and got a sick glock which is better than all the pistols I had anyway there's also the Aeria Ignite application that you can get and every 12 hours you can open a loot box too that gives you random items. I got dual berettas permanent which was awesome... I just got them so I haven't tried them yet. When you level up you can get free items too like permanent weapons or get a 14 day armor something. That's what I do like about this game though how they give you weapons that last a few days sure that sucks right but that gives you a chance to try the weapon out and get the feel of it in case if you do want to buy it. I'm an older player and they didn't used to have this but now they have like red and blue tickets? These tickets get you permanent guns and stuff too for free. Free you say? how? well back to those free rewards when playing matches or the Aeria Ignite application those cases drop red and blue tickets as well. More blue than red tickets but there's not that much of difference they both offer different permanent guns to buy. I've been playing this game for almost two weeks and I almost got enough red and blue tickets to buy a permanent gun each. Enough talk about the you do not have to pay to win feature let's talk about the gameplay. It's fantastic there's plenty of game modes to choose from. Say you want to play with bots or you want to play against zombies (infected) with your friends or say you want to be the zombie and come after your friend! There's to many different game modes to play in this game to name them. To be honest they're still adding new game modes! Like this tank game mode I haven't tried yet I've been focusing too much on getting my level up lol. It takes a while to level up but you get these boosters out of those loot boxes or if you do those surveys (offers) you can buy a booster for 9 AP which is cheap asf. It's only a one time purchase though lol but you can still get the boosters from the loot boxes. I purchased the xp booster for 9 AP and it started out with what 200% boost. Then I when into a boosting ex game mode then it went up to 340%. Then LOL I unboxed in one of those loot boxes a 400% xp boost... When I applied that and went back to that game mode I went up to 645%. I have no idea where the extra 5% came from but I am not complaining! Anyway this is my game fo life! I hope you all enjoy it as much as I am! PS. I'll see y'all on the battle field I'm going to play right now byes XD","April 5","true","199.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Shame on you....\n\nAt the moment I do not reccommend this game mainly because you will lose so much money from it. It may say Free to Play, but it's one of the biggest Pay 2 Win scams out there. Before 2013, this game was amazing. Now, it's a pile of microtransaction s**t."\n\nEDIT: The changes and implementations Aeria Games has made in the time I made this review have improved the game immensely. I do recommend it now because so many pay to win aspects have been removed entirely. Permanent weapons are back, and almost any gun you can think of can be purchased without spending money. Even though they encourage you to spend money, it is not necessary. Even if one does spend money, it does not necessarily further one's "pay2win" bonuses. Thanks Aeria Games.","September 27, 2014","true","179.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Unless you want to get that tf2 knife, don't even bother looking at this game. It's chances of even working on your computer in the FIRST place are minimal at best. Looking for a fix for it, all i saw was to "install the official version" from their website. But since I wanted tf2 items, i had to screw around with far too many settings in order for it to work. three reinstalls, two steam validity checks, and one new user account later, i managed to get it to start up, but after all of 5 minutes, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ "xigncode" anti-cheat software tells me i'm running a "suspicious program" and disconnects me. Asking for more info causes it to have a damn fit and die, and attempting to view its log file is harder translating the rosetta stone to ♥♥♥♥ing klingon. after multiple short attempts to play, i managed to get on a server just seconds before the game ended, so i could get my knife and leave. i'm writing this review before purging my hard drive with holy water. the game is utter ♥♥♥♥ even if it works at all. and if you don't believe me, look at it's splash screen: http://i.imgur.com/kTwLLN6.png","January 24, 2015","false","2.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

People say this game is only for the knife, but the knife for TF2 isn't event that good, cmon. Although the AeriaGames version is one of the worst versions, you should try Alliance of Valiant Arms on Garena (or Japan/Taiwan/Korea if you live in one of the countries). And of course, I do hate the things that cost money (kind of pay to win) and the fact that the average player would kick the noobs (obviously). This game is fun when there are lots of lobbies in gamemodes such as PVP, QuickMatch and CO-OP, but from my perspective, it's  starting to get boring as there aren't as much as QuickMatch and co-op games as before.\n\nThe TF2 knife is bad.","May 13","true","192.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I've been told that it has been updated, but I doubt it has really improved by a lot. The game has relatively good graphics but displeasing gameplay. Killing people is extremely easy which makes killing unimpressive and unsatisfying. Players in this game tend to be very horrible at first-person shooters, making winning for your team almost effortless. The upgrades on your weapons make your player even more over-powered, as you receive extremely beneficial upgrades on your weapons whereas other players still have default un-upgraded weapons. This makes playing even more easier. The gamemodes almost mimic Counter-Strike and I would daresay this game is merely just a low-funded copy of Counter-Strike. I would not recommend this game unless you're seriously bored and craving to dominate other players... the fun in this game can only last so long.","December 2, 2013","false","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","4"

It is a solely-multiplayer war-themed shooter, with extremely noticable similarities to Counter-Strike. There are a few different gameplay modes to choose from, such as a free-for-all shooting match, team-based deathmatch, and a save-the-hostages mode. It parts ways with Counter-Strike with the in-game store, where you acquire gold and experience, and use it to buy new weapons and items, similar to what you might find in a game like Call of Duty.\nThe game does fall short in communication, making it rather difficult to communicate with your teammates and help each other out. In addition, aside from the buyable weapons, there is little customizability. There are only three classes to choose from when playing, though each class has a large variety of weapons to choose from. The maps are also fairly similar, and don't cater to all classes. All-in-all though, it's like a free version of Counter-Strike, and worth a try.","July 3, 2011","true","4.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iViscosity/recommended/102700/","iViscosity","iG | iViscosity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iViscosity/","22 products in account","This game is great; I've described the feeling you have after playing it below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behavior, feelings and sense of well-being.[1][2] People with depressed mood can feel sad, anxious, empty, hopeless, helpless, worthless, guilty, irritable, ashamed or restless. They may lose interest in activities that were once pleasurable, experience loss of appetite or overeating, have problems concentrating, remembering details or making decisions, and may contemplate, attempt or commit suicide. Insomnia, excessive sleeping, fatigue, aches, pains, digestive problems or reduced energy may also be present.[3] Depressed mood is a feature of some psychiatric syndromes such as major depressive disorder,[2] but it may also be a normal reaction to life events such as grief, a symptom of some bodily ailments or a side effect of some drugs and medical treatments.\n\nCausesLife events\nAdversity in childhood, such as grief, neglect, mental abuse, and unequal parental treatment of siblings can contribute to depression in adulthood.[4][5] Childhood physical or sexual abuse in particular significantly increases the likelihood of experiencing depression over the life course.[6]\n\nLife events and changes that may precipitate depressed mood include childbirth, menopause, financial difficulties, job problems, a medical diagnosis (cancer, HIV, etc.), bullying, loss of a loved one, natural disasters, social isolation, relationship troubles, jealousy, separation, and catastrophic injury.[7][8] Adolescents may be especially prone to experiencing depressed mood following social rejection.[9]\n\nMedical treatments\nCertain medications are known to cause depressed mood in a significant number of patients. These include interferon therapy for hepatitis C,[10] medications for high blood pressure and sleep inducing pills. [11]\n\nNon-psychiatric illnesses\nMain article: Depression (differential diagnoses)\nDepressed mood can be the result of a number of infectious diseases, nutritional deficiencies, neurological conditions [12] and physiological problems, including hypoandrogenism (in men), Addison's disease, Lyme disease, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, stroke,[13] diabetes,[14] and cancer.[15]\n\nPsychiatric syndromesMain article: Depressive mood disorders\nA number of psychiatric syndromes feature depressed mood as a main symptom. The mood disorders are a group of disorders considered to be primary disturbances of mood. These include major depressive disorder (MDD; commonly called major depression or clinical depression) where a person has at least two weeks of depressed mood or a loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities; and dysthymia, a state of chronic depressed mood, the symptoms of which do not meet the severity of a major depressive episode. Another mood disorder, bipolar disorder, features one or more episodes of abnormally elevated mood, cognition and energy levels, but may also involve one or more episodes of depression.[16] When the course of depressive episodes follows a seasonal pattern, the disorder (major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, etc.) may be described as a seasonal affective disorder.\n\nOutside the mood disorders: borderline personality disorder often features an extremely intense depressive mood; adjustment disorder with depressed mood is a mood disturbance appearing as a psychological response to an identifiable event or stressor, in which the resulting emotional or behavioral symptoms are significant but do not meet the criteria for a major depressive episode;[17]:355 and posttraumatic stress disorder, an anxiety disorder that sometimes follows trauma, is commonly accompanied by depressed mood.[18] Depression is sometimes associated with substance use disorder. Both legal and illegal drugs can cause substance use disorder.[19]\n\nAssessmentQuestionnaires and checklists such as the Beck Depression Inventory or the Children's Depression Inventory can be used by a mental health provider to detect and assess the severity of depression.[20]\n\nTreatmentDepressed mood may not require any professional treatment, and may be a normal reaction to certain life events, a symptom of some medical conditions, or a side effect of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment.[21] Different sub-divisions of depression have different treatment approaches.[22] In the United States, it has been estimated that two thirds of people with depression do not actively try to receive treatment.[23]\n\nThe UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that antidepressants should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of mild depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.[24]\n\nSex differencesThere are a number of symptoms that are used to help diagnose depression. Looking at all instances of depression that can be confirmed (i.e. psychological help is obtained or a suicide occurs from depression-related circumstances), a one-author report[25] states that women have a higher rate of major depression than men, but looking at individual symptoms, the gender divide intensifies in some areas, disappears in some, and reverses in others. While women have a greater proportion of somatic symptoms, such as appetite, sleep disturbances and fatigue accompanied by pain and anxiety, than men, the gender difference is much smaller in other aspects of depression. Female respondents report twice the prevalence of somatic symptoms as male (2.8% vs. 1.4%) versus depression not associated with somatic symptoms (2.3% vs. 1.7%). Depression with somatic symptoms is highly likely to also have an anxiety disorder (31.4% vs. 22.9%), to have pain (60% vs. 48%), and to have chronic depression (49.2% vs. 36.8%). Men with depression with somatic symptoms were more likely than those without to have pain (48.9% vs. 28.6%) but were not more likely to have an anxiety disorder (39.3% vs. 31.9%) or chronic dysphoria (37.8% vs. 33.3%). Instances of suicide in men is much greater than in women. In a report by Lund University in Sweden and Stanford University, it was shown that men commit suicide at a rate almost three times that of women in Sweden, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Center for Injury Prevention and Control report that the rate in the US is almost four times as many males as females.[26] However, women have higher rates of suicide ideation and attempts.[citation needed] The difference is attributed to men choosing more effective methods resulting in the higher rate of success.[27][28]\n\nA problem in analyzing the results of mental health research and mental health statistics is the prevalence of reporting bias. Currently, the only way to collect data is to survey people and look at hospitalization rates. There are potential problems with people mis-reporting their feelings, the frequency of depressive and anxious thoughts, and other information that subjects might want to suppress\n\n\nDefinitely play this game. gr8 m8 eye r8 8/8","November 26, 2015","true","1.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZaboCS/recommended/102700/","ZaboCS","Zabo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZaboCS/","157 products in account","My god..this game. This game is by far the worst game ever I have ever played in my entire life and what will be the rest of it. I gave a positive review to Bad Rats, a game about terrorist rats that massacre and desecrate cats among other animals. But.. this f-ucking game, this game is the worst thing I have ever lied my eyes on. I after downloading it for an excessive amount of time as it is way too large for a game that has no content I started it up just to see I had to spend another 45 minutes in the game launcher installing patch and updates. I started a character, FPS dropped almost instantaneoulsly. I saw before my eyes,the worst game ever, terrible graphics, disgusting rendering, the worst optimization of any game, even of all games by Unity combined. It was like looking at a dead baby fetus get cut open and sucked through a sick persons mouth. It was the most disgusting and revolting thing I've ever laid my eyes on.\n\nI changed the graphic settings and options to lowest. Now,keep in mind, I can run Arma III on high perfectly fine around 30 frames-per-second, but this game even on the main menu on several graphical settings, I can only run it 10-15 laggy fps at times, the mouse stutters and it feels like my brain is being put through a blender. I can feel the heat of the game, the complete aftermath of the warmth of the aspect of radiation surrounding the game after getting completely and brutally ♥♥♥♥♥. I started the tutorial only to see my frames per second drop to 1-3 at a time. I felt like I was getting several blows of a metal bat to the head. I felt light-headed, queazy and nauseous. I felt the pain and my stomach drop like someone had a knife at my throat, ready to end my life, if that was the real situation,at this point,I would've wanted to die.\n\nThe game was popping up with blaring alerts and irritating notifications while the volume was excessively loud even though I had it at a regular level. I saw someone running but when I tried to press WASD, the game was stuttering and trying to keep up with the horrific graphical settings. I could barely set a foot forward when the unexpected happened. One of the worst games and terribly looking and shouldn't require any processing power completely crashed after a 2-4 minutes freeze. It was just looking at someone get murdered,it was pathetic and sad. I started it back up,after waiting almost 15 minutes trying to get back to the tutorial,I finally set foot out,it was popping up with random messages that were laggily appearing and disappearing, sounds were going on and off while horribly acted and scripted voices were yelling at me like a few immature autistic kids acting out a play on a playground. It wasn't worth it. All of this was not worth the torment I was being required to suffer through to even play the tutorial for more than five minutes. I was barely just moving around aftering getting yelled pointless instructions at me when the unexpected happened again. It f-ucking crashed again.\n\nI wasn't sure if I could start it up again,it felt like my head had just been cleared. It was as if I was experiencing the worst headache that anyone was to suffer to date and it was instantaneously cleared with no side effects. The game was closed, I didn't think I could handle anymore, I hovered my cursor over the uninstall button craving the pleasure of clicking it and ridding this blight from my PC,my life and as I hoped, my memory. I looked back,thought maybe..just maybe I could suffer through such crucial torture, one more time. I started the game up,feeling droggy. It was as if I was all of a sudden drugged,it felt like I was beaten,thrown into a vehicle,droven miles out to nowhere and thrown out in a field. I felt empty,alone, this game made me feel worse than I can even describe with words,no matter what I see in an enemy, no matter how much I hate someone even with the largest amount of malice,never in my life would I wish someone to have to suffer through the pain that is playing this disgusting excuse of a game. Looking through which seemed to be at this point blurred vision, I saw the horribly designed and just plain gross menu screen. I felt the horror of my past, every memory that seemed to be low points in my life,the horrific memories,I saw myself so desperate at this moment,even craving these moments in exchange at any moment for the release of this pain.\n\nAll I wanted now was the sweet release of death, to die rather than see another moment of this game as I clicked on a button to join a match after struggling for several moments trying to sluggily getting through a plethora of banners and ads. I managed to get through it like a maze meant for masochism and pure struggling and frustration. I had finally joined a match,I was okay,I got through it. I made it, I finally made it through the amount of torture I could finally experience. I finally met my complete and full capacity for pain and torture and I was done. I thought I was done through all of this,my frames per second were at zero but I was fine now,I was alright, I could give up now. I had such a high thrist for death, never in a million years I would've thought I could desire this so greatly but at this moment, I was.. and now, it was the only thing in my life that I truly wanted. Then the most depressing and relieving thing coinciding together happened. The game crashed.\n\nI was rid of the pain. I was rid of the sorrow that this game was. I felt like crying but it felt like my memories had been partially exasperated, that the truly evil things in life were gone, the rest of my life would seem to be easier, to be a cake walk, because I had barely made it through this journey that is Alliance of Valiant Arms and I survived after being completely physically exhausted. I was emotionally exhausted. And finally, I was to the fullest extent, mentally exhausted. I had never had such a desire for everything to just fade away, the desire for it all to be quenched. Though,I was relieved and possibly a future patient of post-traumautic stress disorder now after experiening this long and bitter journey. I was done. I felt sorrowuful but I slowly installed the game watching it's memory and mark it left on my computer disappear..forever.So I only have one thing to say to this gam- no, this excuse for a bit of space in this world, this direct spawn of Satan. The most miserable thing that has ever crossed the plane of life and this Earth.

And yes I agree but I still love A.V.A . I have played this game since ijji was it's owner,too bad I have lost my old account but started a new one and I really have some nice stuff ^,^ .\nOk ok lemme start the real review, DO NOT listen to TF2 players opinion, I am a Team Fortress 2 player and I love this game , despite the hackers , I really do love this game no matter what !!! So stop the trash talk if you suck at A.V.A , then you suck at TF2 too .\nMost of new A.V.A. players rage when they see you have to pay to get good weapons , trust me you don't need , I have farmed around 189 blue tickets in game and i have waited a good event , like over ride event and spent them , and now i have some permanent stuff from boxes bought with 25 blue tickets ;D so you need to be patient , I pwn people with normal stuff , if your good you don't need weaps, SKILL > any item you consider OP ,.\nBelieve it or not it is balanced , you will need only 1 thing to survive the game , equipment , the one you can buy in the shop , even if is so expensive is worth buying for 1 month , and farming is easy playing on event or 3box with other guys to earn in game money ;D\nA.V.A. is a beautiful game you will really enjoy playing and is worth in my opinion,","May 21, 2015","true","227.3"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","7","13","4","0"

Also, when I shot several weapons, they didn't make noise. 10/10 would play this Early Access game never again.\n\nUpdate: Valve needs to remove this game A.S.A.P. as it installs nGameGuard, a third-party anti-cheat software that is a keylogger and can be used against you. In case if you don't know, a keylogger records every single key stroke you make, and a hacker can decipher that and steal your account and password on any website ever!

With this game you have to buy different weapons with in-game money, and if you don't have enough in-game money, you buy in-game money with real money. (Micro-transactions.) and with many of these F2P games, they don't update when you aren't playing. When you decide to play, it shows up with a loading screen, saying, "Installing Updates 1 of 100" This is the same with PlanetSide 2, APB Reloaded, War Thunder, Tribes: Ascend, etc. I still recommend this game, if you are patient on the loading screen.","June 18, 2014","true","29.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

North America, Europe, Korea, etc, AVA is no different) was originally published by the now-defunct ijji. ijji sold the publishing rights of AVA to Aeria Games. Unfortunately, Aeria Games goes against many of the values I saw ijji had. ijji was decent at being involved with the community, listening to their feedback, and not trying to just grab everybody's cash. Aeria Games is exactly the opposite, they have ZERO community involvement, and are always scheming for a way to get their hands on your money. Before, you used to be able to buy weapons permanently. Now many weapons are "rented." Instead of paying $15 for a permanent gun, you now pay $15 for 30 days use of that gun. Not to mention that AVA used to not be so concerned about usage duration, they had (keyword: had) a system where equipment would degrade as you used it rather than just expiring after a set amount of time.","January 6, 2014","false","67.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The menus are so confusing and cluttered, it's really hard to find anything. Only thing I could do was click "Quick Join". I jumped into a game of Team Deathmatch on some Christmas map, which was one the worst maps I've ever played in an FPS, however I'm not sure if it was official or modded, if it was official, this game's maps suck hard. First thing I noticed was that I couldn't change my settings in-game, which meant I was stuck on an extremely high sensitivity all game. Second thing I noticed is that this game is UGLY. Seriously ugly. The ADS is one the worst things I've ever seen, it literally takes up the whole screen and is very hard to use and looks bad. The paid guns are extremely overpowered and from what I've heard that real money shop is a rip off. After a game that lasted far too long, I checked if I had the Black Rose and uninstalled.\n\nThis is the worst F2P shooter I've ever played, the gameplay is just boring, unbalanced and just not fun at all, the game has bad graphics and some of the worst menus I've ever seen outside of JRPGs.\n\n0/10, don't play it unless you want the Black Rose.","January 8, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I hope you like it :)\nIn this review i will disucss the good and bad things of the game AVA published by aeria.\nLet's start off with the reasons why you should try this game.\nFirst, the graphics look amazing if you have gaming pc. I have a 500euro laptop and graphics still looks decent to me. The navigation in the menu is simple the way i like it.\nSecond, the game is free to play you don't have to pay any money to play this game.\nAVA also really fun modes from co-op to escap. Very enjoyable!!\n\nThe bad things.\nAeria... Aeria is comparable to EA, they don't care about the gamers and only care about the money.\nBugs and hackers, self explanatory.\nTwelve year olds.

I hope you like it :)\nIn this review i will disucss the good and bad things of the game AVA published by aeria.\nLet's start off with the reasons why you should try this game.\nFirst, the graphics look amazing if you have gaming pc. I have a 500euro laptop and graphics still looks decent to me. The navigation in the menu is simple the way i like it.\nSecond, the game is free to play you don't have to pay any money to play this game.\nAVA also really fun modes from co-op to escap. Very enjoyable!!\n\nThe bad things.\nAeria... Aeria is comparable to EA, they don't care about the gamers and only care about the money.\nBugs and hackers, self explanatory.\nTwelve year olds. If you play this game prepare yourself for a really bad community and a horrible chat.\nNot competitive\n\nIf you are looking for a free to play shooter and you don't care about seeing a hacker one or two or bugs and a bad community. Then this is a game for you.
