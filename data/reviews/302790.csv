And of course some of these items are hidden in hard-to-spot rooms and behind interesting bosses, creating a great sense of progression as you unlock more of them and open up your options in combat.\n\nThe difficulty is certainly there, specially if you are not playing on easy. Bosses will pack a punch, but they telegraph their moves with their smooth animations, which is where you see the Dark Souls inspiration.\n\nAnd to top it off, it has pretty graphics and cute characters. Even if it's kinda short (I could finish it in 1 hour on easy) it contains a new game+ mode, and the hard mode will most likely put up a nice challenge. I'm sure I'll come back to this game multiple times yet.\n\nOh, and I definitely recommend that you also check out Momodora 2, which is more of a "metroidvania", and is free.","June 30, 2014","true","7.5"," 67 of 87 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","67","87","0","12"

The game mechanics and the character movement through stages are like butter. Like, room temperature butter. And what I mean by this is that when you jump to another platform you don't slide off of it by .5348958349054 mm and die, like in some certain platformers I have played before.\n\nPaired with an amazing soundtrack and cute graphics, after beating the game it really left me wanting more, and by this I was really wanting more on the premise of the plot and story. The downside to this game lies in its brevity, however as a balance to this its small price tag is definitely worth it.\n\nOverall what really makes Momodora III a great game to play is its simplicity, however it is not simple. It has the perfect combination of challenge, variety of items, and skills. On top of that I just love super kawaii pixelated graphics and good music. So if you like all of these, this is definitely your game.","April 4, 2015","true","8.3"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","30","31","4","5"

I don't like that it goes back to a linear style like Momodora I but at least in this case you can backtrack if you missed things.\n\nI hear a lot of people saying that this game is either too easy or too hard, and I really think these people aren't understanding a major element of the game: the items. There's a large handful of items that you can equip three at a time that affect your attacks and your characters' abilities. With these you can make your character outright broken, or a one hit wonder. The game can be played as you like it, and if Momo is too hard for you, you can play as Dora instead, who has one extra heart, seems to do a bit more damage and starts with the Dream Ring instead of having to find it. I've also heard people say this game is short (as Momodora games always are) but it took me about nine hours to finish doing everything and getting all the achievements, which I'd call reasonable for a game like this. Just running through once though? Yeah it won't take long.\n\nThe bosses were all somewhat basic as usual, some even reusing patterns from Momodora II, but I still thought they were pretty fun. The areas are all vibrant, unique and visually sharp, the graphics are as smooth as always and the sound design as well, however I'd say I enjoyed Momo II's soundtrack a bit more.\n\nOn the downside though this game has way too many instant kills, pits and spikes sure, but also bombs. Explosions are a one hit kill and this gets frustrating later on when a lot of enemies have bombs. The slightest misstep in some areas can send you into a pit or explosion immediately, sometimes right after a room transition. It doesn't really add to the difficulty either, as checkpoints are usually nearby anyway.\n\nI also didn't care for the secrets. I really did enjoy finding the secret boss and how it was done in general but I found it all by accident absentmindedly and I wouldn't have if I hadn't just gotten lucky. There's also an achievement for saving a character before she dies that I frankly had to look up because I couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do (one item having a massively misleading description didn't help either).\n\nAll in all I really enjoyed this game, it's a lot better than the previous games and shouldn't be judged by them alone.\n\nbuy momodora 3","November 5, 2014","true","9.4"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","3"

It seemed so simple and sweet, and it had that little charm to it that I cannot explain properly. It was only about two bucks, so I figured why not?\n\nAs it happens, this little game that I thought would be average now lies upon the list of one of the best platformers I've played in a long while. It's an interesting turn of event, and it is a living proof that one should never ever base their first impression on the price or the simplicity.\n\nNow, what exactly make Momodora III so special and attracting to me? Well, for one, the visuals. They are simple as they come, not too much details but just enough to give a mesmerizing experience. The landscapes are refined and very expressive, all while keeping a certain basic aspect as well. The designs of the characters are unique, and while they don't have much personality, their clothing and facial expressions definitely give them life.\n\nThe other important aspect is the soundtrack. I have very high standards when it comes to music, and the fact that this game's music has struck me so hard only goes to prove its importance. It's beautiful. Not many words are required to express the soundtrack of this game.  It's simple and quiet, and blend into the game flawlessly. You won't remember it for being a changing pillar of music, but rather for how mesmerizing and perfect it is for the experience.\n\nThis game has three difficulties. Casual, which gives you all the ressources from the get go, Easy, which gives you a moderated amount of ressources, and Hard, which makes you start with absolutely nothing and less health.\n\nPersonally, I went with Hard on the first run because I enjoy a challenge and you could say that I am almost masochistic. It gave me the exact challenge that I was looking for; a hard but fair adventure. Do not underestimate this mode, since it is rather overwhelming, especially in the first two areas. At the beginning, most dangers will kill you in about two hits, sometimes even one. The lack of items and health marks for a rough beginning, but once you advance a bit, manage to grab a few items and charms, things become a lot easier. Items to reduce damage or increase your attack power... The game gives you everything that you need to survive.\n\nThe game is admittedly very short. The overall adventure took me about two hours on the initial run, and most of the time spent was either me dying or trying to find some hidden goods. You can finish the game in under twenty minutes if you know what you're doing.\n\nThere are six areas in total (seven if you count a certain secret area that you can unlock, though it's more of a special Boss than an actual area). It's pretty straight-forward as a whole, and there isn't much exploring to do, which is a bit of a let-down. You really just go forward, defeat some enemies, reach the Boss and move on to the next area. It's a classic formula that I'm used to, so it doesn't bother me, but the fact still remains that it might come off as somewhat souless for others.\n\nMomodora III is a little gem that goes under the radar for many, and I can't help but feel that people should give it a try. It has its charms, and I'm certain that you'll enjoy it if you can overlook a few details there and there.","June 17, 2015","true","7.2"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","26","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/recommended/302790/","CueZero","CueZero","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CueZero/","1640 products in account","Momodora III is the charming new installment in rdein's fast and fun series of action-platformers centered around the two priestesses of the game's namesake and takes a slight departure from the metroidvania styled Momodora II for a more straight-forward and accessible action adventure. While some may be disheartened with the change I was more than happy with the almost arcade-like progression making it an incredibly addictive and easy to pick up game that still retains all of the depth and flair of it's predecessors.\n\nThere are still plenty of secrets strewn about the various levels for you to explore for and you'll have more than enough game-changing equipment to find for your journey, the platforming is precise thanks to simple controls, and the combat is lightning quick with a choice of split-second slashes or charged bullets for more strategic situations. The game can be very challenging, especially with the harder choice of sisters, since the enemy placements are very well thought-out and require some fast-thinking to deal with unharmed and the bosses will require lots of fast reflexes and coordination with their almost Megaman-like patterns.\n\nFans of future-classic indie favorites such as Cave Story, or Noitu Love will be instantly attracted to the visuals as there is a lot to adore here from the cute and offbeat cast of characters to the lovingly crafted backgrounds all with a touch of that nostalgic old school flair. The soundtrack carries the same retro appeal with it's soothing melodies that change and intensify with each new area, all-in-all creating a package that any fan of old school indie platformers should not be able to resist.\n\nThe game is a short but sweet experience with lots of amazing creature designs and lore to learn.  Replayability here is extremely high and with it's secrets to find, multiple characters of varying difficulty, and diverse approaches to each boss the game clocks in at around an hour per play which in my opinion is just right as each level and setting changes often enough to stay engaging and not overstay it's welcome making Momodora III an easily recommendable experience at it's affordable $4.99 pricetag.","July 3, 2014","true","5.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

But for all that, I find myself wondering if my time and money were well spent - its short length (less than 2 hours on my first playthrough, on Hard) isn't a negative by default, but Momodora's gameplay is soulless.\n\nThere's plenty of classic platformers around Momodora's length, but these encourage careful progress, skillful play and an understanding of stage layout and enemy behavior. In short, they're worth revisiting, and become more satisfying when one understands its intricacies. One quickly realizes that Momodora doesn't ask for anything so strenuous. Here, players can just make a mad dash for the next healing point (3 screens away, guaranteed), save, and do it again until the end. Stages and enemy placement and behavior are as simplistic as they come, and bosses attack slowly (usually with one heavily telegraphed attack). There is no difficulty curve - if you can get through the first five minutes, you'll make it to the end.\n\nSo Momodora will take less than two hours of your time, and less than five dollars out of your pocket. You'll see some pretty pixel graphics and have a soothing soundtrack (in ogg format) stashed in the game files, but the game you play will probably be forgotten by the time you head to the toilet. Is it worth it? The obvious wasted potential poisons the experience of the game itself - this could have been quite good, but when the credits came around I wondered if the developer was more interested in making the assets than the game. I recommend against it - I have enough games in my library that I certainly could have spent the time on better games. I imagine most people can say the same.\n","January 2","false","6.6"," 25 of 31 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","25","31","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenGamer37/recommended/302790/","GreenGamer37","GreenGamer37","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreenGamer37/","130 products in account","The key for this game was indirectly given to me by the developer for review purposes but it will not change the tone of my review\n\nMomodora III is a 2D action platformer inspired by Cave Story and developed by rdein. As the name says this is the third Momodora game but the only one to be released on Steam while the previous two installments can be downloaded and played for free. In this game you play as Momo or Dora, two priestesses sent to investigate events surrounding the village of KoHo.\n\nThis is one of those games that can’t be judged by cost. Most people might think of this game as an average indie platformer but they are in for a surprise. Momodora III is one of the best platformers I have played in recent years along with Cave Story.\n\nOne of biggest attractions of Momodora III is the simple pixelated graphics. The environments of each stage are polished to the brim and each stage has its own atmosphere conveyed to you by its appearance. The character sprites look top notch for a 2D game and each enemy is graphically different from the other. Though there isn’t much dialogue in the game, the designs of the characters give them some life, especially their different clothing.\n\nAnother important aspect of platforming games is the soundtrack, which Momodora III excels at. There aren’t words to describe the music other than it is simply beautiful. Each stage has its own music to go with it and all of them are just jaw dropping to listen to. The music just gets you immersed into the game.  Soundtrack isn’t something that I pay much attention to but this game does it so well that I just had to include it in the review.\n\nThe gameplay is quite basic. You have to traverse through areas as your specific character, jumping and moving on platforms to make it to the end of the stage while avoiding obstacles. Each stage has its own specific set of enemies which differentiates each stage. The enemies are unique is attacking patterns as well as appearance. In order to counter these enemies you have 2 types of attacks, normal and ranged.\n\nYou also have item slots which you can customize depending on the stage or your play style. Items can be bought or found on different stages. Like most platformers, after you reach the end of a stage you face a boss. The bosses have their own attack pattern and by memorizing these patterns they can easily be beaten. The bosses are really memorable because of their uniqueness.\n\nThis game also has three difficulty settings Casual, Easy and Hard (easiest to hardest) so you can choose the one that you most prefer. On the easier difficulties you start with more hearts and items, on Hard it is vice-versa.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that it is really short and can be beaten in 30 minutes! With its cute graphics, fun gameplay and only costing $4 Momodora III is a must buy for lovers of the genre and casual gamers as well.","December 15, 2015","true","4.1"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","0"

The music, written by Elektrobear, is quite pretty and evocative, and can be bought on bandcamp here: https://elektrobear.bandcamp.com/album/momodora-iii-original-soundtrack\n\nFYI the only difference in the current version between the two characters is that one extra shopkeeper shows up in first level for Dora.\n\nAlso, I think Momodora I and II are freely available, but playing them is not required to enjoy this game.\n\n(Disclosure: This game was gifted to me from a bundle, by a friend.)","December 24, 2015","true","5.4"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Momodora III won't take you more than 90 minutes tops to beat but it's a game with no fat or padding out and has decent replay value.  The most unique aspect of the gameplay is that you can find/buy various items that act as accessories and can have multiple ones active at the same time.  Even though the game is short, you can new game plus and carry over your accessories so use can whatever you unlocked the first time through right off the bat.\n\nGraphics, sound, and controls are solid.  Save points are frequent enough that death isn't a huge setback.  There are three difficulties, with the easiest basically rendering you invincible.  Bosses look good and have some decent ideas but are mostly beaten by getting right up into them and whacking away rather than any particular strategy.  You can play as either Momo or Dora, with Dora being the easier of the two.\n\nIn short, a fun little pixel game that reminiscent of Cave Story in multiple ways with a decent bit of replayability.

The game isn't filled with exploration as in Momodora 2, but it isn't as arcadey as the original game either.\n\nThis game comes in two difficulties, Momo (hard) and Dora (Easy), each staring their own individual girl. The controls are simple, and leaves the player a lot of room to decide how to defeat a boss or get through a level. You can buy equipable items at one of the few shopkeeper locations, but even these won't make a big difference when it comes to facing a boss. Overall, the game gives you quite a bit of a challenge.\n\nThe music is pretty good too, really fitting. Hellkite Drake brings a wonderful addition to the music, complementing Elektrobear from the previous installments. That said, Momodora 2's album was great also. You should check it out.\n\nFor $5, you're getting a really nice game with a good amount of difficulty. The length of the game might not be enough to justify the purchase. My recommendation would be to play the first two games, since they are free on the dev's website. That way you get a taste of what to expect and have a good introduction to the series.","July 1, 2014","true","5.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

Much of is has ont he table can be easily overlooked due to its simplicity. It's short and you really don't get to know any characters who are present in the game. And thanks to the save system in play, any obstacle that looks to block your progress can be easily and quickly overcome with trial and error.\n\nI only ask for more utilization in the tools provided. The presentation is great and its really unfortunate that things come to a close as soon as they do.\n\nI'd recommend to the developer that they draw inspiration from the Castlevania games on the Nintendo DS for how to effectively give proper attention to various differing areas while making sure each are does not overstay their welcome. I feel this game would benefit from that particular design.","January 9, 2015","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I was expecting this to end before it will even begin. What I've got in reality changed my view on simplicity, and made me fan of these series already feeling like a kid in front of NES once again.\n\nLets start with things which welcomed me in first place. Momodora 3 gives a warm heartful feeling instantly when you see it in motion, amount of details put into pixel art is great here. These are very simple details like: bowing when you interact with shrines, or dirt appearing when you fall from greater distances stunning you for a second. Game is complex with amount of items, secrets, locations and all these are changing the play-style. Although everything ends up quick I cannot say bad word about it. I was trying to get angry on hardest difficulty when I was diyng like garbage. But I couldn't, just the opposite. My sympathy for Momodora grew bigger, it is fair game towards players if something fails, you are to blame not controls or anything else. Soundtrack is phenomenal and it will play for me many times from now on.\n\nI would love to get better grasp on plot of this and lore, soo I could justify appearence of characters and bosses.

I have nothing but compliments on those aspects. They put me right into the right mood and into the world they built.\n\nThe gameplay is where things get a little fuzzy. Platforming is good. All the right elements are there, the character size, the camera system, speed, platforms size and distance. Everything comes together nicely and jumping around is fun and challenging.\n\nThe level design (or room design?) has its highs and lows. Sometimes you enter a room and a couple of steps ahead there's a spike pit. Seeing how fast the character move this is a very easy death right there. You just entered the room and is still pressing the dpad, you fall over simply because you didn't have time to process the room layout.\n\nMinor nitpick: The first screen of the game tells you to press A to start (as in the xbox button). I am using one so that's nice. But after that is all arrow keys this, shift button that.\n\nCombat is the main problem I have. Even some ingredients that made platforming great are getting in the way of a good combat system. The character speed and size on screen, combined with the range of melee attack, forces you to get uncomfortably close to the enemies at the same time making that very hard. A wrong touch at the dpad and you are taking contact damage or too far to do any damage. Add to that a ridiculous amount of screen shake, projectiles flying around, ghost companion, and the confusion is all set. I find myself squinting at the screen the whole time to find my character and it's just not enjoyable.\n\nHonestly I'm finding it hard to get over the combat aspect of the game. I keep closing the game and then opening again, because everything else is so engaging. I only played for 40 minutes, and I don't know if I'll keep playing.\n\nSo, reiterating: I'm not such a great fan of the game at the moment.  But it is very affordable! and others might be ok with the issues I am having. So, if you like what you see at the trailer I suggest giving it a shot.","October 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This game's difficulty is taken from the classic platformer Microman. You can equip items to your character just like in Skyrim. There's blocks that fall down, just like Tetris.\n\nIn fact, I would find it hard to not compare things in this game to other games.

It still has a lot of soul and extremely cute pixel art, and there are some cool secrets to find. It could use a little more content, though. If this game spent a tad bit longer in development it would've been a gem but as it stands its pretty much comparable to Momodora 2, just with a lot more polish.\n\nThe combat is fun with the different items that augment your character, the music is great and not as chiptune-y as you'd expect, and the boss fights are interesting (although somewhat derived from other games, I'm lookin' at you Prismriv-I mean Arabella Sisters). This game is extremely fun to speedrun, and it is fairly replayable because you are bound to miss many of the secrets and hidden items. There are also two characters. I played with the hard character because the easy one was a little bit too powerful in comparison. I didn't wanna cheese the bosses at all.\n\nAlso, to the devs: the Arabella Sisters fight has problems when you take out the white one first. You can be completely barred by projectiles due to their random patterns when they come out, and then you get hit by the purple beam attack because you can't jump over the huge wall of purple bullets. That's pretty cruel.\n\nOnce I noticed this, I just killed the purple one first because the white one is seriously a pushover in her second phase, and so is the purple one in her first phase. This is kinda imbalanced. And yes, I know that you can redirect the bullets by jumping. That sometimes isn't enough. Unless I'm missing something (I never tried to attack the bullets to cancel them, so maybe I'm just stupid for not doing that), I see it as a problem.\n\nOther than that, I give it a momo/10\n\nAlso, HellkiteDrake made some music for this game.\n\nThat's kinda why I got it.\n\nI miss you Hellkite\n\nPls, pls com back ;_;","January 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So, it sort of makes it easier. In this game, you gotta find out a lot of things by yourself. Such as finding some hidden items, finding some hidden areas, and knowing what works best and what item combinations fit your play style.\nThe game is short, to the point where someone beat it in less than 7 minutes. With that being said, its not surprise the stages are short. If you know what you're doing, you can easily beat the game in a short period of time. If it's your first time and you're a scrub (like me) it might take you a while.  You don't have to rush though. It's nice to take the time to explore, try to find items, kill enemies or just enjoy the soundtrack. (which is great, you can buy it on the composer's bandcamp.)\nSince the stages aren't too long, the bosses must be difficult and take a while to beat, right?\nUhm, not exactly.\nThe bosses were quite easy for me on my first time playing, some not even hitting me. It just depends on your skill level, or if you know what the bosses do. Some people say they're hard, I say they're quite easy. The story isnt really explained all too well in the beginning, since the game is short there aren't many ways the game directly tells you what the story is, aside from the good ending of course. Some bosses have a very simple pattern, some have attacks that are easy to avoid. Some are harder than others. Heck, even some of the earlier bosses are more difficult than the later ones.\nThe achievements and speedrun records will keep you busy. Try to get both endings, try to speed run. Heck, it even changes stuff up a bit and you can do a pacifist run. Aside from the exploring you can, trying to 100% it, or just trying out new item combinations that you didn't before, this game will keep you busy. You can waste so much time just trying to beat your own records, or even attempting to beat the speed run record.\nI'll try not to spoil too much, so lets get ahead and finish this already somewhat long review.\nMomodora III is a fun, short, simple, cute, time-consuming, and amazing game. I would recommend it, even at like five dollars. Sadly, there's not much content if you just want to beat the game. I would definetly recommend getting Momodora III and at least beating it if you enjoy platformers, or if you want to get introduced to platformers.\nIts difficult to give this game a rating, since I love it so much. However, it's definetly one of my favorite games.","June 18, 2015","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you are into the kind of retro like graphic, then this game is perfect for you. And the background colouring changes shadow to create the illusion of distance truly makes the game graphical beautiful.\n\nGameplay:\nBefore I played the game I read a review of someone having trouble in the game, so I decided to play it on Hard. I spend some time learning the attacks one melee and one ranged, simple yet a great move to avoid over doing the attack part. There is a great mix between using melee or ranged attack instead of just one being completly broken. Enemies are unique and interesting, learning patterns will be required in some rooms in order to move on. Now boss fights! They have certain abilities that really classifies the boss makes it unique and on hard you have to learn the attack patterns which is a huge plus! Instead of just being able to cheese the fights. Movement is smooth and easy going you won't find any problems there.\nAll in all gameplay is really great and well thought of!\n\nSounds:\nThe sounds are great and you won't get tired of them, even if you have to spam attacks. The sounds are retro too and makes for a fun/enjoyable game. Sounds will also hint attacks a lot of the times so you can predict things that way.\n\nDifficulty & Length:\nI spend 1.5 hour completing the game on hard, could be done on less if you are used to the bosses. Overall a game worth that time and more if you are interested in hunting achievements, I will be doing that atleast. It's not super hard, but not super easy at the same time, planning will be required!\n\nThe game is worth buying, and I hope to see Momodora IV :D\n","January 15, 2015","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

No problems with keyboard or a 360 controller. The bosses are a nice touch, too. I'm glad the dev has been adding more with each entry.\n\nThough short, I think there's enough replay value with doing speedruns or challenge runs (specifically, not using certain items that trivialize the bosses).

Despite its simplicity and brevity, Momodora III positively throngs with variety; the painterly vistas, fine chiptune soundtrack, and whimsical enemy roster are constantly shifting, and there are even a couple side-missions wedged in there -- one of which is a hidden boss, no less!  The story of this and the other games interlock, but the narrative is still fairytale-vague; there's enough detail for atmosphere and series branding, with the rest left up to your imagination.  That's fine with me, though.  I've always loved the "rustically cosmic" viewpoint of fairytale and myth, and if it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you!\n\nThe physics were okay in the previous games, but one thing I really love about Momodora III is that Dora and Momo have a real sense of weight to go with their speed this time around.  They don't hop in unswerving Castlevanian trajectories or anything, but there's a fine heft to their little pixel bodies.  You feel like you are actually steering kawaii lumps of tireless, monster-bashing meat, not flicking around passionless digital ghosts that would feel perfectly satisfied in either state of inertia.  This game has nailed it where too many indie platformers falter!\n\nMomodora III is the very model of a low-cost neoretro platformer.  Though it can be completed in under 25 minutes if you rush, you shouldn't let that concern you, as the game's potential brevity completely belies the amount of fun that can be had from it.\n\nMOMODORA FOREVER!","April 10","true","4.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's a lot of careful and meaningful design put into combat and movement, with rdein taking a lot of lessons from how combat and movement worked in Momodora 2. The art direction is great, the soundtrack is incredibly pleasant and never "in-your-face," and there are lots of little secrets to discover as well as a big one. If you're into achievement collecting, it's very realistic to get all 8, which I kind of find nice sinec most games either have you grind out kills or time spent playing (this is terrible for MP games).\n\nIt took me 3.9 hours to play the game to 100% completion, according to Steam, so that might be a turn off even at the $4 pricetag. Overall it's a great journey and if Momo3 is your first, grab 1 and 2 (like many have said before me) before you consider buying 4 just to get the full experience. I'd honestly love a "boss rush" mode for Momo3, but the game can be completed so quickly I don't think it matters.\n\nIt's also a great toaster game if you're on a netbook or something and want something to play.","May 15","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The pixel art is gorgeous and clean, with excellent use of color. The soundtrack is fantastic, but it unfortunately doesn't appear to be available for download anywhere. Difficulty and level design are, for the most part, very well considered. There's enough optional collectables that power up your character in different ways that you can tailor the difficulty to whatever degree you prefer. The game can be Dante Must Die-hard or Kirby-easy; it's all up to you. Level design is very Clasicvania-esque in that it expects you to take things somewhat slowly and to carefully consider your approach to navigating obstacles and fighting the common enemies. Boss fights are fun and well designed, but have a little too much health for how simple their attack patterns are. Though, as mentioned above, there's an item you can abuse to make boss fights ridiculously easy. Replay value is going to stem entirely from how much you enjoyed the game. It offers a New Game+ where you keep your items, but as far as I could tell nothing really changes between the playthroughs (though feel free to tell me I'm wrong). But that's okay. It's short and fun enough that I can definitely see myself busting out Momodora III on a rainy day. It doesn't offer any real incentives for a replay, but neither did any of the classic titles it's clearly inspired by.\n\nIf you're a fan of classic Mega Man, Castlevania, or Cave Story then consider picking this up.

Others compare this to games such as Dark Souls and Cave Story and I can see why they would say that. This game is very difficult and the graphics are reminiscent of Cave Story, however it is missing some of the basic elements of DS and CS.\nIt's true that the game is hard, frustratingly so. Where as in Dark Souls when the player messes up it is entirely the player's fault, this game has you dying from otherwise easy situations.\n1. The lack of any sort of invincibility frames after you get hit means that you can go from full health to dead because you got stuck inside an enemy.\n2. Your main attack's range is shorter than the sprite shows so this leads to you having to get really closer to enemies than you need to.\n3. The physics are slippery in that it's hard to position yourself outside of the enemy's range but still inside yours without getting hit.\n4. Lastly, you can not rebind the keys unless you use a gamepad. 'A' and 'S' are not the keys I want to use for jumping and shooting, it's too crowded.\nOverall, I can not recommend this game but if you are in the mood to get mad then by all means get Momadora III for your masochistic pleasures.","July 16, 2014","false","0.6"," 9 of 28 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","9","28","0","0"

I bought this game instantly when I knew it was out. I played Momodora II (freeware) and loved it very much so. Momodora II was a very fun and cute Metroidvania that was short and had some fun bosses. It wasn't an amazing thing like Bunny Must Die is, but it was worth my time. So anyways, Momodora III.\n\nI bought it. The first thing I noticed that the start level was a straight shoot with nothing interesting about it. Then the rest of the game was the same thing. No more exploring. This means that it just ends up being simple level design with basic enemies in them. In terms of movement, there is no double jump in this game. There is also no real mobility skills. This means as a platform it is massively lacking. As the levels are much more linear as well, there is nothing to really explore. The backgrounds look nice enough, but it is just basic level design.\n\nThis brings it up to the combat. Easy mode character is stupid easy, with the ability to tank enemies without a care. Hard mode character does need to be more careful. However, for both of them, due to the very simplist nature of how you attack in this game with the lack of fun movement, it is boring. The boss fights tend to have all of three moves each. Basic enemies will have one to two. I know the Momodora II had the same issue, but it felt longer than this and the map itself did bring some exploration.\n\nThis review is a bit over the place, but the core thing is this. Play Momodora II. Nothing added was of value, and the things that did change got worse.

From my experience there was barely any story and the replay value (to me at least) is non-existant. The art and settings are amazing, and I wish that they were expanded on.\n\nLong Version I played through this game once, and here are my thoughts on it:\n\nGameplay     This game has two difficulties, very easy and very hard. When I played I chose the easiest difficulty at the beggining but half way through I switched over to the hardest difficulty just because I wanted to see what the game had to offer. Well, the game wasn't wrong, it was very difficult.\nI wanted to like this game so much, I really did. I love the art style and I love the setting. However I just felt that the game was too fast for me and too unforgiving. The first time you fight the bosses there's no way to know what their attacks are going to do! The only way I could beat any boss in the game was to try the boss over and over again until I know their  3 attack pattern  and then just dodge them over and over again until you can just spam the attack button while they charge up their next attack.\n\nStory     The usable items are plentiful and fairly creative, there's also a number of secrets to find, but even then this game doesn't have that much replay value for me to play it again. From what I played there's not much story except for one or two npcs and a bit of talk from the bosses before you fight them.  I haven't played the previous two games so I don't know if this game is a continuation or not.\n\nVisuals     The art is amazing, I haven't seem art this good in any game since... ever! Animation quality overall is spectacular, almost everything is moving all the time which creates a feeling that everything is alive. The fact that the resolution is so low doesn't make the art any worse, in my opinion it makes it better. It leaves a lot to imagination and allows you to almost "create" the characters yourself.

Momodora III has two playable characters, Momo and Dora, which both have their own difficulty level. Momo is HARD mode, and Dora is EASY mode.\n\nThis game is filled with merchants, and although fairly linear it does have multiple endings, and the music and graphics are great! However it is a pretty short game (I clocked in at about an hour and a half on my first run through), but after beating the game you can essentially start with a "New Game+", where the levels are slightly more challenging and you get to keep your items from your last run.\n\nThe only attacks you get are your sword and a letter that you throw. Your attacks are upgradable though through merchants scattered through out the levels. There is also a 'summon stone' for sale, that once equipped will summon a Ghost Girl that will aid you in your quest; while she can act rather "Tails" like at times, wandering off cliffs frequently, she is very useful for fighting bosses and the Mario style ghosts which stop and go invisible when you're looking their way.\n\nThe main challenge of the game is learning the basic patterns of the enemies, and avoid falling objects while jumping over spikes. Your standard retro platformer fare.\n\nAnd As far as the story goes, there isn't much to it, and for the most part it is mostly inferred through sparse brief dialogues with NPCs, and a couple events. The story could be easily summed up in a couple sentences, honestly.\n\nI only have 2 complaints with this game. The first one is that it starts in Windowed mode (at least on my machine.) Adventurously I remedied this for myself by seeing what the F keys did - you can switch to fullscreen mode by pressing F4; however it would have been nice if the game had a menu option that either told you this or switched to Window modes for you.\n\nMy other complaint is that once you're playing the game, you can not go back to the main start menu without exiting the game first. It's not too big of a deal, but it would be useful. Also it's a little quirky how you exit the game while playing: you must first hit escape, followed by F1.\n\nOverall, this is worthy, and highly polished successor to the first two Momodora games (which are free from the developer's website!) So if you enjoy games like Cavestory or Legacy of the Wizard, you should buy this game! It's real good stuff.","July 1, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(1h blind clear for vets, around 2.5-3h for 100% achivs)\n- Bosses are too predictable. (1/2 repeating attack patterns, or repeating attacks in same pattern)\n\nUnless you're a platformers addict like me, I'd suggest to wait for a sale, considering the extremely low content.\nHowever, I've greatly enjoyed this game, and would also like to recommend its predecessors as well to enjoy more of this bliss.

It's very short (I finished the hard mode in an hour and the easy mode in 17 minutes) but it's a lot of fun and it's only 5 bucks.\n\nGameplay is really simple. Run up to enemies and hit them until they die, or just try to avoid them. The key is learning your attack range. You also get a charge attack, which can be used from a distance. You can pick up items that make you stronger too.\n\nThe best part in my opinion is the art, which is very bright and vibrant pixel art.

The pixel art and music are terrific and there is an interesting story motivating your actions. Not incredibly deep, but that's okay. This whole game feels balanced for light play and is the type of game you will likely come back to from time to time and finish in one sitting. I was very impressed with how balanced it is. While it's tough, save points are availible so you don't have to backtrack forever. Also, there is a great shop and equipment system that allows you to juggle a handful of items giving you power ups. It's simple to grasp and each item feels valuable. I found myself learning how to quickly change items on the fly, giving me the best advantage in a given situation. Sometimes I needed more money, sometimes more power, sometimes more defense and sometimes better ranged attacks. I recommend this game if, like me, you enjoy retro games and retro-styled games done well.","March 7, 2015","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are tight and responsive and if you die it is your fault. There is no time limit so you can take your time and slowly defeat enemies and learn the layout.\nThe story is that Death has turned evil and Momo or Dora, being shrine maidens, must purify her. Momo or Dora must battle her minions through various stages with huge boss fights to defeat Death. The cool thing is whenever you die you will see Death laughing at Momo or Dora.\nMomo and Dora both have an extremely short reach with their melee weapon, but it goes into an arc. They also have a ranged attack and Momo and Dora both control the same from what I saw. The enemies are not difficult but serve as cannon fodder for money. You need money to buy items from vendors or you can find them after a boss fight or in a secret treasure chest.\nThe game does not support two players, the boss fights are simple when you learn their patterns and the game is linear, too linear. Once you know the layout you can zoom through the game in under 30 minutes.  I also wish that Momo and Dora had different colored weapons and a different ranged shot. All these can be overlooked and still be enjoyed.\nTo sum it all up, I whole heartedly recommend this game to people who are looking for a new experience or just want to test out their platforming skills. It is worth your money and you are guaranteed to like or love it. I will be looking forward to the other games in the series.

Hard mode is  20 steps up the difficulty ladder, making the game quite a challenge and testing your skills, your knowledge about the few enemies, the worlds and the various items you find or buy during your journey.\n\nYou can start the game as either Momo or Dora, 2 Priestesses on their way to stop evil and save their village. There sadly is not really all that much story in this game, same goes for lore. Every character in the game looks adorable and interesting and it's kind of a shame we don't get to know much about them.\n\nI really enjoyed the level design, at no point did the game feel cheap and it harmonized perfectly with the combat and those really good controls. Besides the visuals thats what i really liked the most about the game, these controls were that damn good. There are also some secrets in the game, which are nice but nothing mandatory or special.\n\nI found it sad that the game was as short as it was, it took me 1 hour finishing it, my other playthroughs took about <20 minutes or so.

A short and sweet enemy-busting platformer set across multiple stages on your shrine-maiden quest to rid your land of annoying demons, chock full of so much adorable. Geez.\n\nEverything controls fluidly and tightly, except for landings. On more than one occasion I would fall off a single-block ledge because there is a very slight ice-slidy stop, but it's nothing frustrating, Unlike the explosions. I hope whoever designed the bombthrowers and bomb-fish be put in time out for making them a one-hit kill. The bosses are rather simple, but still very snazzy, particularly the badass Bell Keeper.\n\nThe graphics and sound are, as you can imagine, designed to be cutesy and endearing, and indeed they are quite the squee material, but there is a sort of brutal, almost tragic honesty to bits of this game. The death screen is particularly egregious: a shriek, a flash of red, and a cut to black. Yikes. Several other aspects of the world, spoilers notwithstanding, had an impact that speaks a volume of the game's bittersweet style with barely any words.\n\nAs for length, I will say frankly that this game is very short. The mere three hours I have were all it took to complete every achievement(yes I was playing on easy, shut up). I was kind of begging for a "normal mode", as there was either easy, hard, or casual. Maybe some of the difficulties might be Japanified.\n\nThis is a great game, its style is something I would like to see more of(even in the game itself, incidentally). Quite worth the price, especially on sale. Perhaps the previous two titles could enter Steam in the future.","December 18, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They all offer neat little perks like reduced damage, healing when you kill enemies, and one changes your attack animation into something longer reaching and cooler looking.\n\nGot a "New Game +" option at the end, and it warned me:  "Things will be a bit different this time". Hopefully a bit more challenging but not too much, I enjoyed the casual and fun gameplay alot. Highly recommend this game for anyone who was born in the 8-bit era like me.

On my Logitech controller jump is X and shoot is B. That makes jumping and shooting or jumping away while I'm charging a shot annoying and difficult. It should be A and B, not X and B. that is the main reason I will likely not be taking on the HARD difficulty challenge.

If you're not into retro-platformers, particularly of the cutesy variety, you're gonna hate this.\n\nThere's still one area that bothers me... a long row of spikes that you look like you should be able to get over... somehow... hm.\n\nThere are some serious issues - there are some bombs which insta-kill you if you land just outside them, but not if you land in their center (???!WTFAAAA???) and the difficulty levels are sadly lacking a "normal" setting - only casual, easy and hard. And hard is more like stupid-hard, extreme-style.\nI guess it supports speedruns, which is important for some people, but they have no souls.\nAnd the game-teaching can be a little obtuse at times - I got about halfway through before I realised you could equip items, or rather, how you did that.\n\nOverall, 6/10, 1 point more if you enjoy this specific genre.","July 22, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art style is unbearably adorable and manages to show incredible attention to detail in each of the levels. The music is beautiful and always sets the scene perfectly. I played through a few times, looking for all of the little secrets, and it was a pleasure every time. It runs fairly smoothly 99% of the time on my made in 2010 low end model computer, too.\n\nIt has a few negative points, however. There is some attempt at a story, but it's a little half-baked because the dialogue is often inane. This is compounded by the fact that the game is very short once you know what to expect and becomes incredibly easy when you are able to acquire a game-breaking item midway that makes the bosses a breeze. Mostly I just wish it was longer, though.","July 9, 2015","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My gamepad was detected automatically, though I still preferred keyboard. The game is quite short, you should be able to easily complete the whole thing (with achievements) in under the time needed to drop cards. The boss fights range from decent to amazing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Waluario/recommended/302790/","Waluario","Waluario","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Waluario/","483 products in account","Momodora III is the third game in the Momodora series, the rest of which are available to download for free with Momodora III being the first of the games on steam. Momodora reminds me a lot of Cave Story, and in a good way. Like Cave Story it uses pixel graphics to paint a beautiful and varied enviroment, has a great soundtrack, tight controls and people refer to it as a metroidvania for some bizarre reason. I never understood that line of reasoning: Metroid is a metroidvania, Castlevania: Symphony of The Night is a metroidvania, Bunny must die is a metroidvania, Cave Story is an Action Platformer with some light exploration elements and so is Momodora III. Having said that, like Cave Story it is a good Action Platformer with some light exploration elements, it's also fairly challening. Oh yes, by the end of the game I was certainly no stranger to the purple-haired lady on the Game Over screen. Fortunately the game offers three difficulty options: Casual, Easy and Hard. This coupled with shops, pickups and plenty of hidden treasure means that the player has all of the means possible to make the game as easy or hard for themselves as they want.\n\nAt first, the story in Momodora III seems mostly non-existant. You spawn in front a small shrine and you go on to steal a key to open a door to move on, there isn't even so much as a quick exposition for the player. There's a quick description of the backstory in the manual along the lines of: "Demons from hell are attacking your village, go do something about it." but it really doesn't give much. However, there's definitely a greater narrative in the works and there are a lot of things going on that the player is never shown unless they go through the effort to look for it. Maybe there's more in the previous games that would help the player understand what's going on, I honestly don't know.\n\nThe game has two playable characters: Momo and Dora. As far as I can tell there really isn't any difference between the two of them gameplay-wise. Okay so, playing as Dora gets you a shop where there normally wouldn't be one for Momo but the item sold can be gotten for free in the very next level, so why even bother?\n\nOverall though, I don't have anything real bad to say about Momodora. Well... okay except for one thing: It's short. I mean Really short. The game can be completed in about 30 minutes and that's counting side quests. My first playthrough clocked in at a little over half an hour I believe (not counting time between deaths). Although, depending on your point of view this could be a good thing, The game is great for speedrunning and even if it's only 30 minutes it is definitely 30 quality minutes with nice graphics and a beautiful soundtrack.\n\nIf this sounds up your alley I can definitely recommend Momodora III.","February 6","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not long, but it's not meant to be long, it's meant to be perfected between multiple playthroughs. If you liked Cavestory and want a bit (a couple of hours) more, this is the game you're looking for.

Just by looking at the sprites you can tell that, though I will say that this game has some pretty cute sound effects. This game is extremely casual with a generous easy mode and a fair casual mode (I'm too lame for hard mode). It took me about an hour and a half to beat a casual run and then around 40ish minuted to do two speedruns (I thought you could get the speedrun achievement on NG+, but you can't). So if you're expecting a long journey, don't. This game is meant to be a short experience.\n\nThe gameplay isn't too complex, you jump, attack, and pick up a few items to mix up your journey. There's not a lot more than that. People have said it's Metoridvania, but it's not. There really any branching paths and only a few secrets. It's more of an action platformer than anything else.\n\nThe story is... not really there. Well, there is a story; "You're village is being attacked by monsters, lets try and fix that". You'll only learn that if you talk to an NPC. There's no explanatory cutscene or anything. There might be more backstory, world building, etc... in the previous game, but that's beyond me.","February 9","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's short, but some variable story events, challenge achievements and a New Game Plus mode add replayability.\n\nAn equipment system lets you customize your abilities and allows for some fun combinations.\nThere's a weird design choice that takes getting used to, but works out somehow: Your own attacks are drawn on top of everything else, so reckless rapid-fire attacking is prevented by the need to keep your screen clear.\n\nEnemies aren't hard to dodge, but getting hit is really punishing. In hard mode, you die in 2 hits. You have to play carefully and strategically. The level means you have to stay on your toes and can't cheese everything, even when you've unlocked some powerful item combos - with the exception of the 5x damage item, which serves as an easy mode for boss fights and can be avoided to preserve the challenge.\n\nMomodora 3 brings nothing spectacularly new, but it delivers a memorable good time for very cheap.

The first digital only game I've ever bought as well. Why?

"I will defeat you!"\n\nAnd to my (pleasant) surprise, one of the major problems I had with the first two games was finally fixed... I had controller support! This series has always desperately needed that, because &$%@ keyboards, yo!\n\nTo my (unpleasant) surprise, this game feels like a gigantic downgrade from the previous ones. The gameplay is fairly uninteresting, and while trying to play it safe and compromising between the linearity of the first game and the open Metroidvania style of the second, it just comes off as kinda bland. It's still okay, and more than worth the small asking price (on sale, that is), but a little disappointing for fans. Also, as many have already stated, it probably should have come bundled with the first two games, since they're already free.\n\nI recommend this in hopes that the next game in the series shakes it up a bit more (and it definitely looks like it will).

The third game was the first to be sold commercially, and very much deserves it.\n\nGraphically, it continues the progression from Momodora to Momodora 2, with more detailed backgrounds and larger enemies. The gameplay, too, follows on the previous title's advancements. This time you can choose between Momo and Dora, the protagonists of the first two entries, with Dora’s quest serving as the game’s hard mode. With either one, you collect items that allow you to use different powers against an array of monsters and bosses.\n\nThe level structure is something of a compromise between that of the first and second Momodora games. You have discrete levels, but can teleport back and forth between them at any save point. At the end of each, a boss awaits. Not only are these powerful enemies more frequent than in prior entries, they have much more interesting patterns and better hit detection. They're more fair, and much more fun.\n\nWhile it lasts, this is a top-tier game, but it's extremely short. Though no platforming master, I was able to beat the easier scenario in under three hours. Still, that was under three hours of excellent action-platforming and some enjoyable light exploration, offered at a very reasonable price.","June 3","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay is tight, though what I really love is the colorful pixel art and the music. Oh God, the music! If they had the soundtrack for sale, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Also, the pixel art style reminds me of Cave Story+, which is good. All in all, it's worth the time and money.","June 6","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
