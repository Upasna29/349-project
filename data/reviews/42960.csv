Ireland...This shall be my empire, this shall be where I forge my glorious ideals of a world wide state, dominated by guiness and whiskey. I began expanding, I was making a lot of money, so much infact that I had begun taking over the world's market, despite the fact I was only a small nation. I needed raw materials, Ireland as an island, was not quite enough. My military slowly grew, soldier after soldier poured out of the gates of the Dublin Military Academy. I tried begging France to join me on my righteous crusade. I built boats as to carry my army, now I shall leave the greatest cities of Asia but smouldering piles of rock and ash. I landed in Johore, a small country in the Malay area. The many armies, 1st of Cork, 3rd of Derry, all fought hard in the jungle and despite disease and famine pulled through, it was now mine, it was now Ireland's.\n\nI begun developing this hell-hole into a place where an Irishman could hop off the steamboat and expect a pint waiting for him by the beach. Sadly, the Ottoman Empire decided we were getting too big for ourselves, too cocky. They landed in Galloway, forcing up to Dublin through the few troops that were left behind after the conquest of General O'Doherty in Asia. I quickly negotiated peace, they demanded we disarm, we had little option. I began to rebuild the country, look to other places for inspiration. Maybe Africa? What about Western America? As I gazed off into the sea from my cosy office in Dublin I got news of Portugal declaring war? What for? I haven't got the slightest idea. And then again, Britain had now declared war on me! What was I to do? My navy was still half way around the world attempting to frantically sail back to the homeland, disbanding the colony in Johore dismantling that pub that had become so popular with the plantation owners.\n\nThe British army quickly crossed from Wales and Belgium, my closest ally at the time, refused to aid me in my most finest hour. I quickly negotiated peace with Britain once again, however Portugal was more stubborn. By calling my peasants to arms I managed to fend off the assault from Lisbon and just as the troops were recovering, awaiting supplies and reinforcements from Asia, the Netherlands declared war. I once again quickly negotiated with Portugal to face my new oponent, the sky was looking dark for Ireland and her dreams of imperialism. The Dutch landed in Derry, I couldn't fend them off, all other nations had put me under mandatory disarmament - I couldn't call any more units to arms, it was a disaster! The Netherlands thankfully backed off, supposedly seeing some dim light in my attempts of peace. Now under four consecutive disarmament orders and being passed pillar-to-post by nations like a puppet state, Ireland sits thoughtfully on the side of Britain - its empire decimated, its people sat in sadness and its cities burning from the cannons of Europe. Not much to do now but bide our time in hopes of another oppurtunity...one day...\n\nSuch is the life of a potato farmer with big dreams.","July 6, 2015","true","53.2"," 614 of 648 people (95%) found this review helpful 551 people found this review funny","95","614","648","551","32"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwishihadacoolcustomurl/recommended/42960/","iwishihadacoolcustomurl","Steelrain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwishihadacoolcustomurl/","180 products in account","A deep and sophisticated grand strategy/gommunism simulator from Paradox Interactive, Victoria II poses several fascinating questions, such as:\n\n"Why is Britain such a lazy doucһebag?"\n\n"How can I have 6 million rebels every year when I have a population of 5 million?"\n\n"Why does Fascist Tibet have a better economy than me?"\n\n"How is Fascist Tibet even possible?"\n\n"Why is everyone leaving my country?\n\n"Britain, help, Tibet is invading me!"\n\n"How is that a game over??"\n\nIn addition to creating endless possibilities for such believable worlds, Victoria II features a robust and realistic world economy that's too complex for any mere mortal to comprehend. Constantly bail out bankrupt factories and watch your country spiral into debt, just like real life!\n\nThe political aspect of the game is also breathtakingly realistic. Watch as your pops do the exact opposite of what you want them to, always be upset with your decisions, and rebel at the worst possible time. A basic guide to politics is that just like in the real world, communism is always the answer. With it, the only one you have to blame for your fuϲkups is yourself, not incompetent AI.\n\nDiplomacy is an important part of the game, especially alliances. If a country is even slightly favorable towards a great power, you can expect them to always intervene against you, ruling out any conflict with that country. Your own allies will constantly call on you for aid, but won't have any problems with leaving you on your own when you need help. There's also the great infamy system, which supposedly prevents blobbing but really just creates artificial difficulty.\n\nThe game might seem way too complex at first, but after an hour or 50 you'll see that it's just as complex as you thought it was, but at least you sort of understand it now. If you stick with it long enough to git gud, the game will be a lot of fun.\n\nOverall: 10/10, it's decent\n\nP.S. Expect to have fun with massive yearly Jacobin rebellions in the latter half of the game unless if you're the USA or Gutter Germany. Although, if you're Gutter Germany, you should probably just kill yourself.\n\nP.P.S. I forgot to mention the many amazing mods there are for this game, including the infamous Pop Demand Mod, which adds great features such as three different kinds of shoe factories, the amazing-and-totally-not-broken Victoria Ultimate which tries to apply 19th century politics and economics to 400 years of history, and vickymod, letting you experience all the epic reddit memes you can fit in your fedora.","December 1, 2013","true","520.6"," 575 of 616 people (93%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","93","575","616","10","28"

The economic system in particular requires about seven PhDs and consultation with the Elder Gods to understand, and sometimes it feels like you don't really have any control over the politics of your country beyond slight nudges. Some would argue that's the entire point, but I digress.\n\nWhere Victoria II will grab you, and hold you, is the sheer diplomacy system. Whereas in EU4 one country will simply superblob, Vicky has a very nice system of balance. Countries rarely blob, and even when they do, they're only one catastrophic war away from being knocked down to size. And just like other Paradox games, Victoria II is incredibly easy to mod. Don't like your flag? Change it! Want to rename a political party? Change it! Feel like modifying a few provinces to balance out the economy? All that's needed is a few corrections in a text file.\n\nPROS:\n\n- Combat feels the most balanced of any Paradox game. Even Art of War.\n- Politics system will always have you coming back for more\n- Incredible attention to detail. Every country has its own republican, monarchist, fascist, and communist flag.\n- Great power mechanic makes it actually feel like you're actually playing as one state among many, instead of just one human vs the same computer wearing different hats\n\nCONS:\n\n- Economy system is an absolute mess.\n- Since Heart of Darkness, sieges take far, far too long.\n\nFINAL VERDICT:\n\nFirst off, I do NOT recommend this to anyone but gamers who have a grand strategy game or two under their belt. Anyone else is just going to take one look at the industrial and demographics screen and uninstall the game. But for those who learn its mechanics, Victoria II will pay back in dividends.","November 25, 2014","true","759.2"," 355 of 366 people (97%) found this review helpful 129 people found this review funny","97","355","366","129","9"

However, I realize that the UK really hates me for a variety of reasons this is bad news because my military is basically a joke. I simply don’t have the manpower to field a force capable of turning back a hypothetical invasion by the UK.\nHey, China has like TONS of manpower, right? Plus they aren’t Westernized and they are currently suffering some pretty intense civil unrest.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarolinaVictoria/recommended/42960/","KarolinaVictoria","Karolina Victoria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KarolinaVictoria/","200 products in account","This is my absolute favorite game of all time and my longest played game ever with 712 hours on steam + 100+ hours on other computers. And I'm here today to tell you why you should invest your money into buying this beautiful pile of ♥♥♥♥, even at full price.\n\nNote: This review is played with all the expansions "Heart Of Darkness" and "A House Divided", these expansions are absolutely  NECESSARY to get the fully enjoyable Victoria II experience (But don't get the rest of the DLC, waste of money)\n\nFor starters, this game is not for the casual player, far off. This game is a part of the very small and obscure genre of Grand Strategy video games which is made by the Swedish Developers of Paradox, but the genre is slowly growing. Grand Strategy games are very much focused on portraying a grander scale of the already existing genre of strategy (for example 4x Civilization), But with this grander scale also comes hard to learn controls, mechanics and A LOT of trial & error if you don't like watching spoonfeeding guides. And adding insult to injury, this is also the most complicated Grand Startegy game of them all, compared to games like Crusader Kings & Europa Universalis. But if you are willing to play a game for several hours just how to learn to play it, watch tutorial videos and get repeatedly ravaged by the AI, proceed reading this review.\n\nA simple rundown of the game: Victoria II is a game about country/empire managing where you play any country  during the time period from 1836 to 1936. You control the economics, build industry, watch your population grow and wage war with the goal of being a dominant power in the world.\n\nLet's start with the content. Put simply: It's endless. You want a game which takes up to 30+ hours just to finish one campaign, and then restart a new one with another of the 200+ playable countries within the game? (Even more if you add mods like HPM, GSG & NNM) There's no goal in the game except surviving from 1836 to 1936, other then that, you set up your own goals . Want to conquer the entirety of Africa as Egypt? Do that. Want slavery to survive and prosper in North America? Do that. Want to turn uncivilized ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s into empires and great powers? Do that. Want to be the dominant world police as Canada? Dude, do that.  It's all up to you.\n\nWhat I also like with the game is that every country in it's own right is unique and feels different, some less and some more. Great powers contain a lot of flavor and will offer a lot of historical facts, trivia, decisions and events that will both hinder and help you. Some nations lack in these areas, but is easily fixable by mods out there.\n\nThe most important mechanic in this game, which is ultimately the extremely unique population system. Every nation (and uncolonized land) have it's dedicated population at the start of the game, and it will day for day to the end of the game grow. This is the most addicting mechanic of the game, trying to make your nation prosper in the best way possible. POP's has they are called, pretty much defines everything in the game. They pay the taxes you need, produce the goods your selling and buying, work in the industry you build and the most important one, they are the soldiers in your army. If every soldier die in one of your divisions, that division dies off with them. There are no imaginary soldiers that appears from nowhere and refills your army here like in CKII & EUIV, Every pop in the game counts, and every death is a casualty for your nation.\n\nThe graphics in the game is very simple and really is just a giant map of the world. But considering what kind of game it is, it does the work and even in my opinion, very charming. While the game always start you out in terrain mode, I suggest you always play in Political Mode, which colors every nation in it's unique color.  The game offers many ways to see the game with different kind of modes in the map veiwer. From looking where population density is highest in your country to where you can currently colonize in the world. Mods exist to further improve the graphics with better huds, bloom and textures.\n\nThe soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal, with amazing orchestral victorian music which sets up the mood and atmosphere to wage war against your enemies. Even if you are not going to buy the game, you should do yourself a favor and listen to the soundtrack of this game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XMtVu-ZtwEk\n\nAnd for those who enjoy modding and playing with mods, this is the game for you! I can safely say that this is one of the most easily moddable games out there. Even I during my free time have created custom countries and events for the game. So if you want to spice up the experience, make your own country and scenario! But if you are to lazy to do that, do not worry. Victoria II's mod community is huge and surprisingly keeps this old obscure game alive even to this day.\n\nWant more nations for your game? (150+, more events and more decisions): http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?683896-HoD-New-Nations-Mod\nWant to play in modern times? http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?689900-Modern-Age-Mod-for-Heart-of-Darkness\nWant the Zombie Apocalypse to hit the world 1836 and then try to rebuild the world? http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/showthread.php?537039-AlterVicky-Apocalypse-1836\n\nThe modding possibilities are endless, which in my opinion is the games strongest point after the revolutionary POP mechanic. Make your own or play the amazing mods that people make even to this day\n\nAnd that wraps up my review. Put simply, I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ love this game and if you like what you are reading, you should consider buying the Victoria Collection right now, or wait until the game hits a sale.\n\n10/10 would play again","August 7, 2014","true","154.6"," 176 of 179 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","176","179","5","6"

We frenchmen were pulling out new inventions out of our butts and became a monopolized country with factories everywhere and railways that went to places even they didn't know. We colonized every possible colonial region we were deemed able to. We added all of Italy into our sphere along with the Suisse, Braziliens, Sokotians, Zulus and Madagascans. During the time, we were gaining thousands of pounds of ducats and eventually became millionaires(as far as ducats go in the game). Along with a standing army of roughly two hundred and forty three thousand and were the second highest as far as score and were even first in prestige.\n\nThen, 20 years after starting, the North German Confederation declared war upon us with the damned red coats. the french marched to the east and slaughtered thousands of Germans. And to the west we marched and slaughtered the british and sat there baguette and wine in hand over the dead corpses of our foes. We got greedy, we desired more than just fancy foods and victory. We desired land, we desired power and thought of our goal to liberate India. Greedily we added a wargoal to liberate India and all it's people and to reclaim our French territory in Canada(Québec). Little did we know, our downfall was immenent. As the wargoals were entered into the war, our infamy hit a solid 26 and then everything went down hill.\n\nOur army was mighty and fierce and feared throughout the land and word spread of our gains in the Franco-Prussian war,  however those who feared us would also be the ones to take up arms against us. All of a sudden, the Russians declare containment saying we, the innocent French, must disarm and pay out our asses so they could enjoy their socialist lifestyles. And then the Spaniards desired to weaken our army and steal our women, so them to declared upon us in hopes of weakening us. It does not end yet, the Dutch, the Dutch desired our women also and so they declared containment too. And so, the typical US mentality kicked in, and them too declared war. Not for our women, or wine, or money, or territory, but just to declared war for the fun of it. Even though less than 75 years ago we freed their ignorant asses from the Brits.\n\nWith the downfall of France imminent, the French sought aid from their friends in Austria and their spheres, but little did they know, they were stuck up asses who sought France's imminent death. And so with baguette and wine in hand, the French army was slaughtered.\n\nThough, we survived all the wars and still had 2.5 million ducats in our banks. We sat atop a hill in Paris and watched as the world suffered at the hands of the Brits, because everyone turned their backs from the rightful world ruler, France.\n\nVictoria 2 is love, Victoria 2 is life.","November 27, 2015","true","40.4"," 158 of 174 people (91%) found this review helpful 130 people found this review funny","91","158","174","130","0"

It is fun and addictive and is a very historically accurate game (if you find games like Risk and Civ V long, I don't recommend it). Unlike other Paradox games, however, this one focuses a lot on internal improvements instead of war (thanks to the extra-restrictive infamy system). All land not available for colonization in the EU series is colonizable here. This makes for an even better game if you convert from CKII to EUIV to V2 as you get a near full historical timeline for one country. It is always interesting to see how the scramble for Africa plays out in each game (especially if you're involved in it). This game also characterizes the time period very accurately. It is full of many interlocking alliances/spheres with smaller countries along with great power intervention. The crisis system also demonstrates how many near-wars occured during this time over foreign affairs, but were solved through dipolmacy. You have the great powers oppressing the rest of the world taking over land from Asian and African nations for resources and strategic positions, as well. Also, the industrialization process makes up for the lack of war. However, this game does have some flaws. The infamy system restricts expansion greatly which is not exactly accurate to history. Perhaps if infamy was only gained when waging war against great powers or secondary powers. It really shouldn't cost 22 infamy to annex Haiti, Cuba, or other lesser civs. Also, there shouldn't be infamy for LIBERATING a county, something usually regarded as a moral action. Things like the Spanish-American war can't occur due to large infamy gains. Also, the in game tutorials are awful and teach you very little. It will take a long time to learn. Another thing is that, don't be fooled, unlike most other Paradox games, there are only two start dates. There is no full range of date choice. While this seems really stupid at first, it does make sense as if you could just start the game at any date, you will miss the whole industrialization process which is one of the main features of the game.

It's looks beautiful and simple though some things should have been put into the top bar to make it quickly accessible but with DLCs such as A House Divided it will fix it. The game starts at 1836. You get a wide range of countries you can play as. It took me a while to choose which country I should go as and after a while I picked Prussia. Diplomacy is quite important in the game because if you don't have any allies and you start a war, multiple Great Powers might take the chance and annex you. You have a couple of categories in your top bar such as Budget, Diplomacy, Research, Population, Military, Production etc. You're gonna have a lot of fun improving your country's production, doing some research and seeing your country go up on the list of top countries and even one day, becoming a Great Power. Being in war is enjoyable, not like in some games, it can take a lot of years for countries such as Germany vs. France (it took me up to 15 years once) but it still makes you wanna write down the big battles of 100k soldiers dying for your country and your dictatorship. Winning wars, annexing countries, taking their regions, humiliatin etc. is so satisfying that you'll feel great! When I humiliated France and took most of their regions in 50-60 years, it felt amazing. When the game ends, 1935., you might feel sad if you didn't complete your goals but ofcourse Hearts of Iron III is there for you.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nMultiplayer felt dissapointing when you couldn't connect to any server and play with your friends. After some time I found out that you must use Hamachi or Tunngle to play with your friends which was rather dumb. I tried the multiplayer with my friends and I enjoyed a lot. Having you and your friends plan for massive Great Wars against your enemies is awesome.\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nVictoria II will take you to an amazing journey that will last dozens of hours and even hundreds of hours. You will enjoy the amount of countries and possibilities, you won't be able to Quit the game. Having no servers for multiplayer was dissapointing but programs as Hamachi and Tunngle will fix it. After playing for some time, you WILL want the DLCs and they won't dissapoint you, they're not like CoD or BF DLCs, they will give you a wide range of NEW possiblities and scenarios.\n\nGOOD:\n+ User Interface\n+ Possibilities\n+ Addictive\n+ Long Campaign\n+ DLCs\n+ Fun Multiplayer\n\nBAD:\n- Having to use Third-Party software to make MP playable\n\nOVERALL:\n9/10","November 25, 2013","true","132.5"," 106 of 112 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","106","112","0","1"

That's not the point of the game, though.  Warfare in Victoria II, like in real life, is a means to an end, not the point itself or why you should buy the game.\n\nWhat makes it truly shine are the politics and economics which give Victoria II the best stuff to play around with during peacetime out of any other Paradox game, something sorely lacking in pretty much all the others, as well as machanics that provide a narrative to your campaign that makes it feel like you're actually playing a nation in the world, and not simply part of a multiplayer game with AI opponents.\n\nIt makes diplomacy a lot more interesting and plausible than usual by modeling a system for instigating geopolitical crises, so gigantic wars between major powers erupt for actual reasons instead of endless gamey world conquest (except against uncivilized nations, which you can pretty much do with as you please, but that's historical for the time).  Even the tiniest nations are playable because you can use the crisis system to get major powers to back your claims to conquered cores.  Playing Greece and want your northern cores back from the Ottoman Empire?  You can never defeat them alone, but if you can get the United Kingdom or Russia on your side, it's entirely possible to fulfill your wildest revanchist dreams.\n\nIt has a deep (but not impenetrable), economic system that makes makes that aspect of the game very interesting and engaging, as opposed to just placing a merchent guy on the map and collecting fees.  This era saw the rise of industrialism and tycoon capitalism, and they've done that justice.\n\nThe politics system is very good as well.  Poor, middle, and elite classes all have their own wants, needs, political desires, etc. that break down to an impressively small scale.  The white yankee catholic factory workers will want one thing, while the black protestant southern miners will want something else.  If you don't handle politics smartly, you can have a revolution on your hands, which could even end with your government ideology completely changing.  It's entirely possible for the United States to become a fascist state, a Marxist-Leninist republic, or even return to monarchy.\n\nIt's simply the deepest, best, most fun game Paradox has ever released in this man's opinion.\n\n10/10, would stamp out wickedness again.","November 27, 2014","true","163.6"," 82 of 85 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","82","85","5","0"

I remember in my first play through of the vanilla game in the middle of a massive world war between just myself (Germany) and the UK I noticed the People's Republic of the United States with an independent Manhattan Commune. In my next game with the A House Divided and Heart of Darkness DLC I played as Germany again but this time Russia released Poland as a sovereign nation become a democracy and lost world power status. At the same time French rebels would make it a democracy, then they would revolt to make it a communist government and then revolt again for the democracy all the while losing its industry and military and falling to 16th most powerful nation. As I dissected the Austrian Empire to be only the Danubian Federation (A smaller nation missing most of its eastern  territories) to be the 20th ranked country. Then after taking the resource rich Manchuria and Mongolia from the Chinese I was involved in a great war caused by the crisis system (allows smaller nations to get great powers to back their claims on other countries). Spain and the Ottoman Empire, who had colonized almost all of Africa save South Africa backed me up against the French, UK, the Danubian Federation and Italy during which I took most of India from the British and made them give the rest of it to their Indian Satellite nation Hyderabad.\n\nYou can completely change history in a warped manner, Have the Ottoman's regain their former glory, help Spain reconquer their former colonies, form Scandanavia and take Finland back from Russia, westernize as Panjab and take India from the British.  Maybe you want to westernize as China and have your legions of soldiers annex Russia, Japan invade Germany. Building the Panama canal as Japan and doing all the things listed above are possible in Victoria 2 as if you can figure the complexity of the economy and population that pushes the game to more interesting heights each time you play.","October 29, 2014","true","36.1"," 73 of 75 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","73","75","5","0"

Same as other Paradox games, it's real-time but you'd be mad to play it without frequently pausing unless you already know what you're doing. Every Paradox game can be said to specialize in one aspect or another of grand strategy. Victoria II does politcs and technology best, but other aspects are generally well-done too.\n\nThe period is a time of great powers flexing their muscle across the globe, vying for influence, territory and resources, and not usually through war but through diplomatic influence, alliances and colonization. Great powers ingame have special mechanics that allow them to add lesser counties to their Sphere of influence, giving them first dibs on resources and safety from invasion. That's not to say other countries are not worth playing, but the couple dozen of countries that have potential to be GPs have more flavor to them and really have disproportionate power thanks to a variety of bonuses that GPs enjoy. Much of the dynamic of the game comes not from painting the map (which is harder to do than other Paradox games if you stick to the recommended level of Infamy) but rather from trying to overtake other countries in Prestige, Industrial Power and Military Power for that coveted GP status.\n\nThis is where the technology system helps even the odds for some countries, and it is good. Every technology has juicy bonuses as well as possible inventions (which have  a chance of occurring each month), which means that every tech brings big progress, giving you lots of freedom to focus on whatever playstyle you want, and making sure there is a great sense of progress all throughout the game. In fact, that sense of progress is done extremely well as different eras go by. You'll see armies and navies becoming faster, population increasing rapidly, industrialization progressing at an exponential rate, and battles becoming ever more bloody and longer, with an emphasis on defense. The scramble for Africa takes place in the 1870s and there's a couple of points where you will need to reorganize and rethink your army composition to account for the new nature of warfare, including new unit types.\n\nThe combat in Victoria II is comparable to Europa Universalis - armies face each other with a vanguard and rearguard each, with a variety of bonuses and maluses affecting how much they hurt each other every day. The armies here tend to be large and the combat attrition-based. You're expected to swap armies to and from the meat grinder to ensure that your army's Organization lasts longer than the enemy's. Early on you'll have to worry about supply limits but with technology this becomes less of an issue, as battles in rough terrain accomodate fewer soldiers at a time anyway. This is definitely a game where you want to pause every day or two on large wars. Civilized countries can conscript part of their poor population, making for even larger armies. But later in the game these are pretty much just cannon-fodder unless you have some professional support waiting for them to help them overcome enemy defenses when attacking.\n\nThe military AI of the enemy is actually somewhat competent. It'll at least know to avoid dubious battles, even when it outnumbers you but you have other advantages. It'll also use appropriate generals for what each army is doing (the generals have their own randomized bonuses). Still, the player's intellect is a force multiplier and you should be able to win any evenly-matched war. Specifically, the AI neglects to really rotate its reserves like a player would, and pull them back to be reinforced at the start of the month.\n\nYour country's ruling party affects a variety of things, most notably the level of involvement you have in the economy. Monarchies can appoint whichever party they want, except unwashed radicals of course. Many factors will affect which parties your population supports, including events, the standard of living, and Militancy and Consciousness levels. Consciousness reflects how much your population will press for reforms, either political or social. This has the double-bladed effect of boosting your research over time, but leading to rebellions if you fail to pass popular reforms. Which just might happen if your Upper House is not as keen on reforms as the general populace. Still, some countries like Russia can pretty much remain a monarchy throughout the game if you make sure your people are content. Every GP and Secondary Power has a slightly different experience, which is strongly influenced by how you manage the country. Absolute monarchies are much more smooth-sailing overall, but usually come with low literacy. China, Japan and the USA stand out from the rest, each with its own challenges and potential.\n\nThere are many tradegoods, but trading and most of the economy usually work on autopilot, especially later in the game when in most types of government, capitalists are allowed a free hand in building up industries. Usually in not a very clever way as they will often just derp out and build a bunch of telephone factories that are just destined to close soon after. But it's the same for the AI countries, so hey. And if you want to micro everything yourself, you can go with State Capitalism or Central Planning policies, found at your local Reactionary, Socialist, Communist or Fascist party, and do everything yourself. At the expense of some efficiency, however. And lots of time, as you will have hundreds of factories by the late game. Still, the freedom is there and a whole different playstyle is available for those who want it.\n\nThe diplomacy is fairly standard for a grand-strategy game, there's nothing too outstanding here. You make alliances, with a Prestige hit if you refuse to join a defensive war. If relations are bad enough between two countries, you can fabricate a Casus Belli, but be prepared to take a likely Infamy hit. This is actually the main way of getting aggressive wars started. There are random events that will give you a Casus Belli for no Infamy, but these are pure chance. Take too much Infamy, and everyone gets to fight you for free. The interesting bit is Crises - when a region gets 'hot' enough due to the presence of a Liberation Movement or other cause, the Great Powers will take sides and, if no compromise is met, will go to war. These are major and will change the face of the map in a different way every time. Here, I just wish the same hotspots wouldn't get hot so often, like in one of my games, Greece kept sparking a crisis every year for a while, with few exceptions as it just got hot faster than anyplace else. Still, it's a great system for keeping things fresh and interesting for GPs especially.\n\nSo compared to other Paradox games, I would say it's more deterministic in that, short of some really gamey behavior, you're unlikely to paint the map the color of Peru or some other minor country. The focus is on GPs and SPs, expansionist warfare is rather limited except against uncivilized countries. You can only choose from two start dates - 1836 or 1861. The type of freedom and variety here is different from other Paradox games, it comes from the amount of control you have over politics and the economy, as well as how you meddle in world affairs. Instead of grabbing land from your civilized neighbors, you're supposed to humilate them, beat them down, leave them open to rebellion, take their allies away and in some cases fracture them into smaller nations.The game's timeframe is relatively short - though it still takes dozens of hours for a normal playthrough - but every game is guaranteed to be different thanks to the crisis system, rebels and other factors.","December 7, 2014","true","375.3"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","57","62","3","3"

The population will react to your decisions based on their political awareness, social class, as well as their willingness to accept or revolt against their government.\nThis is a wonderfully deep game, and its sandbox nature is much more open than Hearts of Iron III was and so it's much more enjoyable at the beginning.\nSaying that it stands head-and-shoulders above all of the scant competition for grand-strategy kingship almost goes without saying.","January 30, 2014","true","068.0"," 39 of 39 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","39","39","2","18"

Victoria 2 is a very deep game, and regardless of your previous strategy experience, you will understand nothing diving headfirst into this game. You may THINK you understand what you are looking at, but you really don't. Like Dark Souls, your very first games, you will fail again and again and again. However, you will eventually, after a few hours, get the hang of things. And it is definetely worth the effort!\n\nVictoria 2 is by far my all time favourite game. Period. It is a grand strategy game set in the dawn of the Victorian era. France has been defeated just twenty years prior, the Ottoman Empire is dying, German nationalism is on the rise, and the British Empire is the greatest power in the world. In this game, you can click on any of the 150+ countries on the map and hop right in. Unfortunately, there are some nations which are simply not meant to be played, namely the Indian and German minor states.\n\nWhen you jump in, you will first notice an absolute flood of information, and all the tabs lead to spreadsheets (which are very intuitively designed). You will doubtlessly be overwhelmed, but that's okay. Everyone is. The reason for all this info is because you have control over every aspect of your nation. From Politics, to diplomacy, to military, to economy, it is all there. This probably seems scary to a new player, but this is what keeps me coming back to this game rather than EU4. There is a lot to do other than paint the map.\n\nNot being able to paint the map or not being able to do a world conquest is the beauty of this game though. It really forces your hand into diplomacy with other nations. Not only that, however, but this game goes much deeper than Europa universalis, for example. Every person is simulated (with populations rounded down to 1/4th of actual figures) and the game has a functioning global economy, with prices rising and falling, and economies of scale which can be affected by wars, rebellions, industry, you name it! You can also expand the influence of your nation, bringing smaller nations into your sphere, and using them as puppets to fight your wars, or to exploit their resources for your benefit. The possibilities in this game are truly endless.\n\nUnlike Crusader Kings or Europa Universalis, this game does not like to let you blob out. With the memory of Napoleon fresh in the minds of everybody, if you do too much aggressive action, you get these points called 'infamy' which slowly decays bi-monthly. If your infamy goes above a certain level (25.00) then every nation tends to attack you. To fend off these coalitions, you have to be immensely powerful, and this seems to be where new players are driven away. You cannot rely on blobbing out in this game, unless you can count on beating the combined forces of Europe alone. My word of advice: ALWAYS stay below the infamy.\n\nThe negatives in this game are few and far between. There used to be still a handful of bugs, however these were patched just a few months ago. The only real issue I have is lack of steam multiplayer, which forces you to rely on programs such as 'Hamachi' just to play in a multiplayer session with friends. Another tiny negative is that the soundtrack does not have anything in store for the intense great wars of the late game, but this is very easily overlooked.\n\nA short list of pros and cons:\n\nPros\n-Amazing gameplay, endless replayability which can keep you entertained for hundreds to thousands of hours!\n-Extremely deep 'simulation' (I hate using that word) of every nation\n-Very well optimized. Runs perfectly on my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop, and even better on my main rig\n-Massive great wars. What's not to like?\n-Beautifully composed soundtrack\n-Detailed global markets and industry\n-Play as any nation in 1836 or 1861\n\nCons\n-No steam multiplayer\n\nIf you are into strategy, and are willing to put 3-10 hours of 'trial and error' time into this game, then definetely pick it up (with all the expansions!). After learning the ropes, you will likely fall in love with this game as I have.","May 4","true","515.9"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","42","44","0","9"

Victoria does have a lot of great mods like stated before but the game really depends on them after a certain point.\n\n\nOverall i highly reccomend this game for anyone interested looking for a easy to master but still fun to play strategy game that you'll have no problem logging hundred maybe even thousands of hours into.\n","July 10, 2015","true","385.1"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","97","29","30","7","2"

I casual strolled the the mall one casual cold morning in mid January. I picked up a few things that were on sale from the leftovers of christmas when I overheared 2 people in the local gamestop talking very fervently of something. "Pardox Interactive" was one word also "HOI". Then it came to me like a chill in the wind a "reckoning" if you will the words "Victoria 2". Even more intrigued as the victorian era was a favorite of mine (after all who dosn't appreciate getting there hands cut off for not meeting your rubber quota) I paid for my items and went home. Google the best bud of capitalist and farmer alike came onto the screen as I finished cooking dinner. Victoria 2 my fingers could not type the 2 words fast enough Victoria, Victoria VICTORIA....there it was all the different wikis and strategies from recent playthroughs I...well I had to take a peak not knowing that this leap of fate would rock my world to its core. Steam had not been on my computer for some time I immediatly booted it and bought Victoria 2. I...well I can't tell you the exact details of "the dream" I dubbed it to my psychaitrist but it was  amazing as if a diving being had been inside the script of Victoria 2. As I dreamed for hours, days, MONTHS EVEN YEARS I began to find my everday routine revolving around turning Greece into a socialist empire. One day maybe a year (im not sure the time frame as I was certainly in limbo) from when I first opend this beauty I found a knock on the door. This knock was different than the others a more forceful, demanding knock.I opened it to find a sherrifs deputy on my front. As I was almost blinded by the sunlight, dazed almost to H**l and back, legs throbing ( but what I understand I did very little moving save to eat sleep and bathroom) I barely remember what the officer said save for "evict" and " 3 weeks". I closed the door as he left and gathered my self to go to the kitchen for a spot of whiskey (helps reinvigorate the senses). Then as I left the flask on the table went to the tele and found 148 messages un heared. I wont bore you with every one but I found that 2 of my close family had died, my reltionship with the opposite sex went bust and my landlord was very angry. Then I well I passed out as I had drank a little to much whiskey. The next thing I knew I was in a hospital bed on an IV and ventilator in critical condition (the officer had forgotten to give me the paper work and had found the door unlocked thank heavens :) ). With my story now being at its end let me leave you with a warning. This "game" is no mere toy but a weapon used by the gods to entrap mortals in an endless time warp. So if you want to have cases of water beside you, dozens of pizza boxes around you and writing a story due to a shrinks orders then BUY THIS GAME....and if not..... then please stay away as your life will never EVER be the same.          P.S. I was declared mentally incapaccitated by 10/10....","December 2, 2014","true","71.5"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","93","28","30","26","0"

You may know me for being the patron saint of this game.\n\nWith a good base game and some really wonderful expansion packs, Victoria 2 is such a neat game, with a variety of things to do, ways to challenge yourself,  as well as semi-consistent updates to help keep the game fresh. There's a huge variety of mods which do a huge variety of things, and the base game itself is pretty much as complicated as you make it out to be- Newer players can test the waters in the safer areas of the world, while more advanced players can play as a greater power competing for influence, micromanage the markets of its land, and play politics to ensure the right party gets (and stays) in power, all in their attempt to achieve the status of #1 in the world, to either oust the damned British or let old Queen Victoria keep her spot on the throne of nations.\n\nYour quest to become the empire on which the sun never sets will not go without adversity- the AI presents a fair challenge to any player and often makes cunning moves to protect its own power and hegemony in the status quo, while weaker powers opportunistically enroach on greater nations through diplomacy or sword to attempt to make themselves a name and put themselves on the map. Finally, internal strife hampers many prospective nations of Europe, as German and Italian states squabble amongst themselves to try and become the best. The world needs a great leader, and that person could very well be you.\n\nIf I had to give any downsides, it'd be the fact that the Infamy system is still a little imbalanced (the 2 province Luang Prabang kingdom being annexed by you is just as costly as finishing off the respected kingdom of Egypt, perhaps even moreso), the fact that there are a lot of prospective time period countries not represented (Which has been dealt with), and the fact that the tutorial is sort of outdated and not very helpful (WHICH I MANNED UP AND DEALT WITH MYSELF).\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Victoria 2 complete edition, or at the very least, as much as you can get out of it. It's a great introduction to grand strategy and one that's kept me interested for a very long time.","November 20, 2010","true","641.1"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","2"

It knocked CK2 right off of that pedestal and took its spot. The population mechanic, the political structure. Infamy is a much better system than EU4s Aggressive Expansion. Plus it's in one of the most significant eras in recent history (1835-1935, with HoI3 picking the timeline back up in 1936 so that they could have one whole game for the WWII era.)\n\nAll of those mechanics make it really hard to understand at first, though. The economy doesn't help either. It's daily, not monthly like in most Paradox games, so you go bankrupt much faster if you've got a loss, even a small one like -5. The population mechanic mixes with the economy mechanics very well; You can't raise taxes too high or your population won't be able to afford their needs. If you raise taxes on the rich, they won't invest in any industry and you'll have a bunch of unemployed citizens unless you reorganize your government to make the economy state-centralized and more socialist.\n\nThe political structure is also a very interesting mechanic. As long as you have a monarchy of some form, you can choose what the ruling party is. If the citizens do not agree with that ruling party, however, they will slowly become more militant and more likely to revolt against you. If you switch to a system where people have the power to vote, then they will be much less militant but you may find yourself with policies you don't necessarily support.\n\nThe country ranking system is also a very good idea, and very representative of this time period. The top 8 countries in the world will become Great Powers, and can influence all of the other countries to potentially bring them into their Sphere of Influence, making them allies as well as protecting the smaller countries from harm. The next 8 become Secondary Powers, who are allowed to colonize and can, at any point in time, over take the Great Powers to become one of the top 8 and gain everything that comes with that.\n\nWhile the interface is occasionally clunky, that's to be expected with older Paradox games. Despite this, you can find pretty much everything you need fairly easily.\n\nIt's a fantastic game. Very addicting. Don't buy it if you value control over your own life because it will very quickly consume all of your free time.","September 27, 2015","true","137.0"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","4"

Albeit playing anything but European powers is a very disappointing and ultimately boring experience, playing as one of those powers will provide hours and hours of entertainment. Victoria II is a game that is quite unique and doesn't play like other games I have played before, which is also true for many other Paradox's games. Victoria focuses on politics of running a country and on the population of the country. It stands somewhere between games like Crusader Kings, where the internal politics is most important and player plays a role of a single character, and Europa Universalis, where only external politics matters and the player basically plays as a whole country. In Victoria 2 player has to manage government and satisfy the population's demands or suppress it, but conquest also plays a very important role and the game forces the player to take part in many wars. In addition, the economic side of the country is also under the control of the player (or not, depending on the political system). Hence Victoria II is quite incomparable strategy game and I recommend at least giving it a try. I had a lot of fun in the game and so should you, especially if you like strategy games.\n\nOh, and the music in the game is gorgeous!\n","March 24","true","30.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

Personally I love both games in short I loved Victoria 1 as it allowed me to function militarily or economically in huge detail, whereas most games only allowed me to do one of these in the detail I wanted. As in my review for Victoria 1 I would like to point out once again how this game is not for the casual gamer due to the deep and complex systems that you must learn to manage through error to be victorious in militarily, economic or political means.\n\nThe biggest advantage over Victoria 1 is the diplomacy this is more in depth and allows you to gain power by been wise and commanding of the world, instead of a rudimentary system where only alliances and basic trades are implemented. Most features of this game are easy to grasp at basic levels but to use them to their capacity a few games will have to be played to learn from the mistakes that you will undoubtedly do and suffer from. For most players the combat system in Victoria 2 is less complex than 1 I personally have not noticed much difference, however considering this game is about retaining power and control when it is slipping away from you been simpler is arguably the military commanders doing this. However for those who are to aggressive and don't exploit the other excellent features in the economic and diplomatic fields be warned of infamy.\n\nIn my Victoria 1 review I talked about the outdated graphics, whilst I still stand about how they are unique and you will get used to them the graphics on Victoria 2 are much better and I do prefer them by no means is this an ugly game. Whilst impressive graphics are not included they do their job and are not key for a strategy game. Another improvement over Victoria 1 is the population control instead of just assigning roles you can also influence what gets built and who wins the elections in a far more complex system which fits the game.\n\nThe fact you can play as any nation at the starting points allows replayability, but can you maintain your nations status or will you destroy the old powers? Build a new economic or military superpower which will have the old orders living in fear and the nations previously aligned to them at your will instead?\n\nMilitarist, economist or diplomat?

The breadth and extant of this game are incomparable. However, that said, there are several words of advice I have:\n1. To fully enjoy this game, you must have the Pops Of Darkness modifier. This modifier takes a good game and makes it much better.\n2. The US political system is not very accurate. There should be a seperate system for the US, in the sense of that no political system available accurately represents the United States. Democracy in this game is based upon the British system of non-set elections, multiple parties, etc. The United States has always had set elections and a two-party system. It is hard to play as the United States in the political sense as a result.\n3. The game should have been extended in time frame. An earlier start, such as 1776, would be more accurate, or even earlier, possibly as early as British unification. By the time the game commences, the United Kingdom is extremely dominant in the global sphere; countries such as Spain and Sweden are shadows of themselves, the best colonial lands are already taken (in the Americas and southern Africa), and if you are playing as Germany, Italy, or Japan, it is quite difficult to get even a small fraction of British power and influence. An earlier start would leave much colonial land open (particulary in North and South America, as well as Australasia), and some smaller powers (such as the Netherlands or Sweden), would have a fair shot at becoming dominant internationally.\n4. Immigration seems to need some adjustments, particulary when it comes to Chinese and Japanese migrations. Although China and Japan were not civilized, massive Chinese immigration to the United States began in the 1850's. Even with these countries becoming civilized, there is essentially no migration from non White nations to the Americas. Furthermore, decisions should be written in, to represent the Chinese exclusion acts.\n5. Some political correctness needs to be written out of the game. In other words, there should be decisions that allow for forcible population transfers. The Jews were often expelled from European countries, and like the Trail of Tears decision in the United States, many other minority groups have been forcibly moved throughout history. This is not a "politically correct" historical fact, but it is a fact.\n6. On the same note, there should be decisions that allow for freed slaves to be expelled. Historically, Liberia and Sierra Leone were founded for ex-slaves, and Pres. Lincoln of the United States debated in sending freedmen to Belize or Africa.\nOverall, this is a great game. These developers spent massive hours in research, and it shows. That said, even the best games can use some tweaks, and a project of this scale is no exception.","March 12","true","057.7"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","14","18","3","6"

I stumbled across Victoria 2 and as it was on a sale bought it thinking it looked interesting. Best decision ever. Although at first I had no idea what I was doing, after playing all the tutorials and picking a moderately sized country (Belgium- good industry and small so a good starting point, can get frustrating later on in the game because of its tiny military). I spent about 60-70 hours on this first play through and loved every second. The economics are so detailed, and political system is pretty complex and the whole game is very realistic. I then played a second campaign as Prussia, uniting the whole of Germany within 10 years and am now at 1928 as the top country in the world by several thousand points having won 5 Great Wars. My only issue with the game would be that the combat is still a bit of a mystery to me- I mostly just create huge stacks and hope. Otherwise this is an absolutely brilliant game which is well worth buying, especially if you see it on sale","October 4, 2015","true","130.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","9","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/olligarchy/recommended/42960/","olligarchy","Olligarchy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/olligarchy/","353 products in account","Victoria 2 is another RTS with a pause game from the fine folks at Paradox Interactive and set during the height of European colonial and Imperial power. Typically when you hear 'RTS' the first thing that pops into your mind are games like Command&Conquer and other simple 'point, click ,conquer' games where your simple goal is to win the war by any means or casualties necessary. Nothing wrong with that, but if that is the kind of strategy you enjoy you should stay far, far away from the far more realistic perspective that Victoria II offers.\n\nTypically Paradox games are never the same (though their somewhat simplistic map and interface might lead some to think they are just the same game in different period), with Crusader Kings series focusing on dynastic ambition, Europa Univeralis on amassing a massive Empire and Hearts of Iron on winning the World Wars. Victoria 2 falls into that golden sweet spot between Europa Universalis and Hearts of Iron where the history is already written. Some things are quite likely to happen no matter what you do: such as the Germanies being united by either Prussia, Austria or Bavaria. Liberalism will also gain strength around the world and the USA will emerge as a Great Power without peer.\n\nOther things though? Not quite so certain. You can easily cripple even the largest powerhouse such as the United Kingdom with an illtimed or ill-fought war that leads to hundreds of thousands of your precious Pops dying out; in essence crippling your industry and dooming you to a waiting game where you hope to recussitate your lagging economy.\n\nThankfully the game has a deep, and I mean DEEP economy system which you can spend hours or even days simply trying to manipulate to become an economic powerhouse without peer. Some games are actually simply put games where you try to maximize your economic potential and gain a toehold in the global market and they can be just as fun and rewarding... or even more so than a traditional warfare approach.\n\nI could go onto rant about the depth, beauty and awesomness of Victoria II, but I figure I should sum this up somehow:\n+Incredibly deep and complex.\n+Lots of replay value.\n-Unpolished gem.\n-Graphics can be a turn off for some.","January 31, 2015","true","117.6"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

There are some issues with the AI, most of which have been patched in the downloadable content if you're willing to pay for them.

( that makes playing as Great Britain impossible, shame but once I learn how to Britain here I come! )\n\nYou also can conquer ( sorry my English is not my strongest point ) more territory, with each country having around 14 or more provinces and the whole world being right there for the taking you will find yourself drawn into the game and struggling to get out!\n\nAnother thing is you do not find any settlements to take over, you just move a army into the province and wait, this is different from the total war series yet again.\n\nI believe I should also mention that there is no end turn... Every country gets to make their choice of what happens at the same time you do, so if you are expecting a total war end button thing then do not, I was and it took me a while to realize that there is something in the top left corner with a pause button on it, once you click that you can use the + and - signs to change the speed of what happens, and because everything happens together it makes it much harder to plan something, because when you move to attack one army they could move to attack yours!\n\nI hope you buy the game and enjoy it as much as what I did.\n\nYours Sincerly\nGaius Julius Ceasar\n","April 12, 2014","true","567.0"," 26 of 42 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","26","42","2","0"

EUIII was my first try and it does not trip my trigger.  I usually play in north america.  CSA succeeds in splitting off.  When I first got the game, Great Britain would eventually take territory from USA, but updates seem to have changed that behavior.  The aspects of Vicky that I like are:\n\n1.  rebel uprisings.  They can make you hustle.  But you can beat them by watching the level of unrest and if necessary mobilizing troops.\n2. national focus.  What you choose will affect how the game plays out.  Choose to promote immigration and populaton will grow.  Choose a political focus, and you may have fewer rebellions.\n3. north america-  this is my home and the states are familiar to me, as is the history.  So I like playing in north america.\n4. anti-imperialism - the game is set up for imperialists, since the era was imperialistic.  But you don't have to play it that way.  The ai is imperialistic, so every one of your neighbors will try to eat your lunch, but you can play them  off against each other via alliances.  And of course you need good border defenses.\n5.  modding- Big mods are hard but mini-mods are easy.  Just (using the mod folder) change the lua file.  For example, I don't like all the time spent on research, so I changed all research (for all countries) to one day in the lua file. I also cranked up the militancy for captured territories (ha!)  And I changed the end date of the game.\n6.  policy choices-if you don't pick the reforms with eye on public opinion, you will get into trouble.\n7. budget- this can be tricky but if you are sensible you can avoid bankruptcy.\n8. economy- this is more for watching than messing with.  Lots of computing seems to go into the choices made by shadowy capitalists.  But also you need to cancel subsidies now and then or your budget will suffer.\n\nI recommend the game.","January 24, 2014","true","711.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

They annoy me so much I've decided to write this entire rant about them. My experiences with these kind of games are rather limited, I've played HoI 2 like 70 years ago quite a lot and HoI 3 only for about 10 minutes cause I ♥♥♥♥ing hate sliders. Otherwise I've played some of the older Total War games and Civ games (including Civ 5) but I can't really compare this game to Crusader Kings 2 oder EU 4 or something. I'm just some guy on the internet so I have honestly no idea how to systematically review things so I'll just name things as they come to mind.\n\nSo first, what exactly is this game trying to be? It's trying to be rather historically accurate but at the same time... it's not. When compared to the mass of events you have in HoI, the game feels really empty. That is understandable as HoI covers a much shorter time range and allows for a more historical simulation. But did really so little happen during those 100 years that most events you have are just random events during elections and such? I wish there were more events that influence my relations with neighbouring countries and such. But instead, everyone is just sitting there and I'm only increasing or decreasing my relations over the diplomacy screen. Lame. At the same time, it's like the game is discouraging 'unhistorical' conquest. Why do I get a massive hit for administrative effenciency (or whatever it's called) for a state just because it's not a 'core' area of my country? You'd think after 50 years of something, people would get used to being citizens of my country, but nope. You don't even have any way of influencing core areas.\n\nAs usual, the tutorials suck. They show you every screen of the game once and that's about it. What is it with these kind of games and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorials? This game was released in 2010, do they still expect players to read through the manual (100 damn pages)? Tell me the most important stuff during the tutorial or have useful tooltips during the game, damn it. It's not like in League of Legends or similar games where most knowledge is meta stuff that you learn as you play, so it's not like it would be entirely impossible to have a decent tutorial. What research should I focus on? What should my army composition look like? What do all the stats a general has mean? Well, good luck finding out.\n\nThe AI sucks. They are incredibly hesistant when it comes to alliances but they will allow basically everyone and their mom military access to their country. Yeah right. It's almost as if borders don't particularly matter. They are also incredibly incompetent when it comes to managing an uncivilized country (or unciv as the community calls them). So don't expect anything from AI controlled uncivs in this game. You'd expect them to wage wars against each other and try to become a relevant country in their area. But instead they just sit there, eventually going bankrupt. Would a decent AI for unvics be too much to ask for? The fact that those countries never manage to do anything really takes away from the game.\n\nAlso the AI is just so incredibly stupid when it comes to leading wars. Unlike in HoI, you can't just declare war on a country. You always need a casus belli (CB) to declare war on someone and if you don't have one, you gotta make one. But making one risks you getting caught which results in you getting infamy (which gets reduces each month) and a lot of infamy is bad (like unrest in HoI). You'd think the AI uses their infamy wisely to press their advantage, but nope. They often just sit there with 0 infamy. But at the same time, when they do have a CB, they will often go to war even when it's complete suicide. You'd think the AI would be competent enough to calculate whether they can win a war or not, but nope. So Germany goes to war against France and gets their ♥♥♥ handed to them for no real reason. Over and over.\n\nNaval units suck. The game only simulates a global market rather than local markets or supply lines so you can't block a country from trading or anything. Hey Paradox, ever heard the term 'Pax Britannica'? Why can't ships support your land units or anything? During that time, a superpower without a strong fleet would have been unthinkable. But according to this game, all you need is a strong land army to beat your neighbours over and over. Also, is a global market really realistic? I mean sure, the superpowers probably had plenty of international trade going on, but did all the backwards Asian countries or small European countries really trade on a global scale? I can't believe that. You'd think a game about a time where a strong fleet was basically the most important thing in the world would concentrate on forcing the player to play along, but nope.\nThe economy is so hard to follow. Why are the production and trade screen seperate? You know, seeing how much stuff I produce and how much is traded (supply/demand) is sometimes important to know so why not just have it on one screen? Doesn't make any sense. It's also hard to understand why your factories aren't selling all their stuff. What's the problem with not selling everything anyway? You'd think they can just store some of their productions and sell it later when demand is higher. But nope. Apparently furniture unsold gets thrown away or something. And why can't the game tell me in a coherent way how much demand for a certain good exists in my own damn country, so I'd know if it's worth producing something myself or not. And sort the goods in some alphabetical order or something. Sometimes you're just searching your ♥♥♥ off looking for something.\n\nLand battle simulation sucks. You know, in HoI, a lot goes into decent planning of an invasion. Not crossing rivers for an attack. Not attacking with too many units from one area (cause generals have a limited number of units they can command, everything beyond is ineffective). Not attacking during winter. Not going for a naval invasion when there are units defending an area. Not trying to do a huge attack in some mountain area. You know, all that kind of stuff that you have to consider in real life. But in Victoria 2, forget all that and just throw your armies together into one big battle! All you need are some good dice rolls and you win. The dice rolls ♥♥♥♥ me off so much. I mean, imagine in Starcraft, a zergling wouldn't hit for 5 damage with every attack. Instead the game rolled a dice for damage between 1 and 10. That's what it's like in this game. I always thought Napoleon or other figures had such outstanding military success because of their superior military strategies or whatever, but according to this game, he probably just had good dice rolls.\n\nThe recruitment system sucks. I like the idea that I can't form units with soldiers of different nationality, but why can't certain religions mix? I guess the game just didn't have a way to deal with that so that kinda sucks. And what's with all the soldiers I have in my empire that aren't enough to form a unit? What do they do all day? Nothing? And what happens when I disband a unit that doesn't have a POP large enough to support them? I can't re-recruit them, so where do all the soldiers go? Do they just disappear? I don't get it.\n\nOh well, I could rant on and on about things I don't like in this game, but nobody is ever going to read it all anyway. So screw that. I guess it's only really fun in multiplayer.","July 28, 2014","false","444.8"," 112 of 206 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","112","206","9","0"

The game by itself is very fun and very playable however before the HOD dlc was added you could just declare war on anyone whenever you wished * yes you took a infamy hit but it still felt to easy to just go to war * With that being said the HOD dlc adds a feature where you have to wait a certain amount of time 90-365 days to justify going to war with a country. With the crisis system added with the DLC it really makes you think about who you want to get caught up in an alliance with because when one of your great powers allies or you get caught up in a conflict every great power is dragged into it no one is safe. * You can chose not to take part in the conflict but you will end up taking a massive hit * all in all I'd give it a 8/10\n\nPro's - very fun\n- Great way to change how history plays out\n- You get cant get enough\n\nCon's\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥ rebellion\n- Little but of a learning curve * not to bad *","November 2, 2014","true","160.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

What about the endless waiting and worrying over external threats that comes from the futility of contemplating one's existance as a less developed country?\n\nIn all seriousness, Victoria II is a great game, and stands as one of the most solid Paradox developed games. If you are just getting into the Grand Strategy genre after playing Crusader Kings II or Europa Universalis IV, then some features may be intimidating at first. There is micromanaging present in both of those games, but probably not to the extent that you are likely to experience when playing Vicky. Like all Paradox games there is a pretty steep learning curve, but this should not discourage you as there are loads of helpful tutorials online.\n\nYou will almost surely start the game try to learn the game as a fairly small nation and end up getting crushed by some event that will seem quite obvious down the line. Try Brazil if you are just starting out. They are a fairly easy nation for learning the base mechanics (using some gamey tactics to take easy uncivilized nations in Africa), but offer a nice challenge in the late game as one usually ends up competing for regional supremacy with the USA.\n\nIf you're still not convinced, here are some cool things that I have seen during some of my playthroughs:\n\nJapan won a war against the Ottomon Empire, and ended up controlling the Hejaz including the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.\n\nUSA POPs revolted and left the USA controlling only the western portion of the country. The Confederates controlled the South, while the Free States of America controlled the north and had replaced the USA as the continental Great Power.\n\nPoland was released in a Great War and promptly proceeded to take up boundaries almost exactly proportional to the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.\n\nPROS:\n\n1. Maps are nice to look at.\n\n2. The unstoppable historical events (think the Mongol invasions of CK2, to a lesser extent) add a structure to the madness that is a Grand Strategy game.\n\n3. It is fun to take historically insignificant entities and create a narrative that establishes them as being a dominant power.\n\nCONS:\n\n1. State control of the means of production ends up feeling like a spreadsheet simulator.\n\n2. Game slows down considerably in later years and is especially slow on a lot of laptops.\n\n3. You will probably 100x more games than you actually finish","December 17, 2015","true","218.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

The Hapsburg Monarchy still rules the Austrian Empire and Germany is still divided into many small states. The Tsars rule over the Russian Empire that still seeks its greatest extents and America is not even 100 years old.  France emerges from the Napoleonic wars in defeat but a new spring is just around the corner. The Ottoman Empire is the "sick man of Europe" but with the right leadership can embrace the new age with renewed vitality.\n\nAnd even more nations await emergence: Japan, China, and of course the oncoming rush for Africa will change the face of the world.\n\nAny nation is playable in Victoria II. Even more can be released or formed. Almost every game is different.\n\nWar isn't the focus here. Though it is an intriguing aspect.\n\nWhat will draw you in: is the diplomacy.\n\n\nNow that may sound boring but pay in mind the dynamics here. Although the great powers rule and may keep you in-check, playing as one (or better-yet, using them to your advantage to gain power) will keep you thrilled.\n\nThe Great powers of the time compete to influence other, smaller nations. Intricate webs of alliances and spheres can easily turn a localized conflict into a world war.\n\nCrises over disputed territories can cause Great Powers to go at-odds, lobbying other powers to join their side in the tension-packed period where the world can drift into destructive war.\n\nLater in the game, these can mean "great wars" were defeat can mean total decimation.\n\nIn fact, each country is only one war-gone-bad from collapse.\n\nCompete to establish puppet states who will obey your every whim.\nSphere nations to earn off their industry and almost garantee their support.\nColonize the unsettled worlds of Africa, the Pacific, and North America.\nKeep other nations from doing the same.\n\nAlso there are different civilization levels. Primitive, Uncivilized, partially civilized, and civilized. Depending on what stage your in impacts your ability to function as a state as your technology will be way behind, you won't be able to build industries, ect. until you "westernize" and join the world as a modern-style nation-state.\n\nThis alone can be fun as you struggle to survive in the old ways or fight against your own people who resist your attempts to change their very culture.\n\nWarfare itself is more fleshed-out than initially realized. Your armies' ability to do recconassaince, perform sieges, and fight in battle is dependent upon their specilized unit makeup and perhaps too-often ignored: their generals.\n\nAn army of 80,000 draftees can be thrawted by a smaller, diverse professional army and an excellently-chosen general who can earn fame by winning battles which will in-turn provide greater bonuses.\n\nNaval power is a MUST to establish yourself as a colonial power. Blockades can WRECK your trade. And just as with armies: diversity and excellent Admirals can win you the day.\n\n\nTrade itself can be largely ignored and should be automated unless you feel otherwise inclined.\n\nPolitics within your own country can grab your attention.\n\nThe availible government types are:\n\nDemocracy\nHM's Government\nPrussian Constitutionalism\nAbsolute Monarchy\nProletarian Dictatorship\nFascist Dictatorship\nBorgeouseis Dictatorship\nPresidential Dictatorship.\n\nTo better understand this, the political party in power decides your trade policy, your tax policy, your military spending, how you treat minorities, ability to intervene/control factories and industry, and your upper house (legislative body) will decide what reforms you can impliment.\n\nDemocracies are governments where the party in power is elected and they guide policy until the next election.\n\nHM's Government are the same but you have the ability to change the government in power (though reforms will require the appropriate members in said upper house).\n\nPrussian Constitutionalism is this wierd grey-area between Absolute Monarchies and Democracies though usually have elections.\n\nAbsolute Monarchies have no elections (which by the way are totally annoying and only nudge public opinion especially in large countries) and can choose the ruling party.\n\nThen come the dictatorships which are usually single-party.\n\nTHE BEST PART IS YOU GET DIFFERENT FLAGS DEPENDING ON YOUR GOVERNMENT\n\nSOMETIMES DIFFERENT NAMES.\n\nAn example is Mexico who, if they have a monarch, will change to the Empire of Mexico.\n\nThe United Kingdom will change to Great Britain if a democracy or the People's Commonwealth if a proletarian dictatorship,\n\nThese will also cause flag changes.\n\nRebels will lobby for reform changes or even radical government change. Sometimes you might want them to win. There's nothing wrong with letting the generals plot a dictator's downfall.\n\nNow finally mods which really can give a lot of replayability to this game.\n\nMods are relatively easy to get though are not taken from the steam workshop but from websites like Moddb.\n\nThese mods have infinite potential offering different timelines, scenerios, new nations, new flags, new alternate timelines.\n\n\nSome even add events to the more minor nations to make them more dynamic to play.\n\nOH\nONE MORE THING\n\nMultiplayer IS possible, don't worry. And trust me, it's awesome with friends.\n\nYou can coordinate to carve up continents for your empires.\nYou can plot against each-other. A great game is Austria and Prussia competing for dominance.\n\nHere's how we do it:\nDownload Hamachi which will allow you to create a network your friends can connect to.\nThey will use the Hamachi-provided IP address the host of the network has to connect to your game.\n\nIt's advised to put the game to save often. We do half-years.\n\nMake sure you verify the integrity of your game cache every time you play together. And close out of the game entirely if someone crashes and do so again just to be sure.\n\nYou MUST have the same version to operate.\n\nIf you want to load saves, the host (and only the host) needs to disable their firewalls.\n\nanother thing: the Host should host the hamachi network AND the multiplayer game.\nWe haven't tried mods yet.\n\nTo conclude this review, make sure you invest into this game (and hope someday for another Paradox game that picks up where this one leaves off--1939 or somewhere around that era). It may seem overwhelming at first, but attack and google around if you're lost. Usually you can find a forum post where they have your question or you can start your own.\n\nFind friends to join the game with you.\n\nTake pictures. f12.\n\n","April 13, 2015","true","487.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Then I decided to go with a smaller but not highly vulnerable underdog nation to ease my learning curve, and went with Japan. After numerous decades and a dozen or so hours of playtime, not only had I civilized and modernized all of Japan and brought forth a new era of industrial supremacy, but I skyrocketed the nation to the rank of a Great Power.\n\nBy the 1880's, after multiple successful wars with Russia, Korea, China, and several other countries, Japan nearly tripled in size and had become the 5th greatest nation in the world, right behind Russia. At first I was overcome by the sheer joy of success, as Japan was ranked third in industrial power and was one of the most prestigious nations in the world. Then as my economy began to slow down, my income was turning negative for the first time in over a decade as factories closed and unemployment jumped. I began to raise taxes, cut my military and navy, and then I began to raise doubts about my countries future. Unfortunately, my doubts were realized.\n\nAs the century turned and the 1900's began, my economy neared depression-level and the national debt was adding up, growing political divisions were threatening the countries stability, and new factions were rising up demanding things like workers rights and calling for a liberal government. The tension came to a boiling point in Pyongyang, where nearly twenty thousand Korean rebels rose up in arms against Japanese rule and were completely annihilated before they could even take two steps forward. At what seemed like the worst time, I was plunged into a war between Germany and Russia, as Germany was the #1 world super power and was my closest ally. Actually, Germany was one of very few countries willing to ally with me as my infamy was a little too high from the Japanese conquests in Korea, China, and Russia. More great powers suddenly joined the war, and it became known as the Great War. My forces were diminished from the get-go, and my allies were too busy fighting their own battles. Before long I was utterly decimated by an invasion force of Russian and French forces and rage quit.\n\nI still haven't turned the tide, but nonetheless I rate this game 10/10.","November 6, 2015","true","19.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","6","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/overwatchsector/recommended/42960/","overwatchsector","Uberwatch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/overwatchsector/","167 products in account","Paradox Interactive must be the masters of Strategy games. This is one of their finest. Victoria II is set in the Victorian Era in the 19th and early 20th century. From 1836 to 1936, you have 100 years to lead a nation to triumph. There are no official goals in the game. You make the goals. But the de-facto prospect is making a country into an economic or military superpower. Some nations like Great Britain are already big at the start, but playing a small nation like Greece can give you the opportunity to give it a time it never saw. That's right. You're not playing history. You're re-writing it. Every little thing you do in the game can have big, unintentional outcomes. Doing something in North America might somehow cause a war in Europe. You never know.\n\nThis is just how fun Victoria II is for history buffs. You can play unlikely countries and turn them into a colonial superpowers. I played Ireland and gave it African colonies. I claimed the island of Hawaii for Mexico, preventing the USA from annexing it in actual history. I played the Confederate States of America and fought hard for it's independence and giving it colonies around the world. There is just so much you can do. So many opportunities.\n\nBut while that sounds like a lot of fun, you're going to have to work hard to achieve your goals. This game has a huge learning curve. In fact, I was almost turned off by the game when playing it for the first time because of how complex it was. But learning is the fun part. I didn't spend a lot of time with the tutorial. I just played around and learned as played. Right now, I know how this game works. But I'm still learning. As I said before, you have to work hard. There's a lot of things to do when managing a country. Here are those things.\n\n- You have to manage taxes and government spending. Some countries might have to rely on heavy taxing on the poor, middle and rich if the government lacks a lot of money in their bank. You might also have to cut down on military and infastructure spending to rake in cash. If you are in serious decline of money, you can borrow funds from the bank. But you will have to repay those debts. Some nations have the population and profits to not worry about funding. But other small nations will.\n-Economy management. You might have to open factories to gain profits. Depending on your country's economic policy. You can open factories or let the AI capitalists do them for you. These factories needs craftsmen and whatever resources the factories need. And let's talk about that next.\n-Resources. This is the fun part. Let's face it. Some nations don't have everything they need. A small country like Texas (which lacks a big population and resources) might have to go to war and conquer weaker nations to prosper. Colonies help boost the resources and pops you need.\n-War. It's not the primary focus of the game, but it's a whole lot of fun. War is not the goal. War helps your goals. As mentioned before, you might need to start a war to conquer a nation/colony for more resources. Or you might go to war to establish a puppet-state which acts like a permanent alliance. Whatever suits your agenda, War can help you.\n-Diplomacy. Okay, it's not really the intriguing part but politics and international relations is what makes things more interesting in Vic 2. If you want to survive, you might need to make a few friends when making more enemies.\n- Technological advancement. You got a century to run a country and while years go by, new technologies will be available for you to develop. This is how a country will improve and become stronger. Military, Naval, Commerce, Culture and Industry are the 5 tech trees you can develop on the way. Culture, industry and Commerce might be important for nations that are just sitting around, but warmongers might like Military and Naval much more better. All 5 of the trees are important however, so don't try and pick the military ones only.\n-Politics. Oh man, sometimes the hardest part of running the nation is how to deal with your citizens. If you're a democracy, people are gonna have vote for their favorite political party. And each political party that could be in power, will affect your nation. Hell, if you're population manages to vote the Communist Party in, you might accidently have caused your country to be a dictatorship. If you're not managing your country well, rebellions can happen and if you can't fight off the rebellions with your military, you might be running a new government soon. You can also make political and social reforms like voting policies or whether or not the minimum wage should be lower.\n-Colonization. This is the best part of Victoria II. There are several uncolonized parts of the world. Not that they lack populations but that there are no established nations there. Australia & New Zealand are mostly uncolonized with the exception of a few provinces. But most likely, Britain will do inevitably colonize them. North America will be the only continent to be fully colonized quickly. There are unclaimed land that the United States, Mexico or Britain will grab before the 1850's. But the glory of colonization occurs in Africa. Most of the continent is unclaimed. There's only a few nations and small colonial settlements that exist.\n-Modernization. Europe, in this time period has the technology that is top of the line. So most of the world is somewhat behind compared to Europe. So if you're playing a country in Africa or Asia, you will want to spend some time modernizing. Japan is the pretty much the only country in the game that modernizes so quickly. But not only that, you get to turn Japan into a colonial superpower faster than any other country that hasn't westernized.\n\nWhile I did not mention everything, there is just so much you can do. Key historical events like the American Civil War can occur when the time is ready. You can also install mods that improve the gameplay experience. The New Nations Mod adds countries that the developers should have added before.\n\nI definitely recommend Victoria II for anyone who is into strategy games and history in general.\n\n10/10\n","December 23, 2014","true","404.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MostPowerful/recommended/42960/","MostPowerful","Siontix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MostPowerful/","192 products in account","Oh God, I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this game yet.\n\nAs I write this, I have 437.3 hrs on record--making this the most played game in my library.\n-----\nVictoria II is a game that starts in 1836 and ends in 1936. So 100 years of gameplay. This is one of Paradox's faster paced games, as years can go by very quickly depending on the speed and how you manage that time. In my case, I only play as challenging nations like: Texas, Hawaii, Bali, Nejd, Ionian Islands, Mecklenburg, and Cuba. I find joy in trying to turn a small nation into a successful empire. This usually takes many years to do, however.\n\n- Population: The main difference I can list right off the bat, compared to other Paradox titles, is that this game focuses on your population. Your population is comprised of: Farmers, labourers, craftsmen, soldiers, officers, clerks, slaves, and other professions. Naturally, if you want armies, you need soldiers. If you want to become rich, you must employ more workers into your factories, and more labourers into the fields. It's very important to keep your population content with your government, or they may revolt. Many may find revolts tedious and annoying, but I for one believe that revolts are one of the most crucial parts to the game. And I will explain why momentarily.\n\n- Politics: While a game like Hearts of Iron III has politics, there isn't much depth to it. You really have little control over what political party rises in Hearts of Iron III. In Victoria 2, your population plays a major role in what political party is elected (assuming that they are allowed to vote!) This game contains 7 different political factions: Liberals, conservatives, anarcho-liberals, reactionaries, socialists, communists, and fascists. Of the 7, I always go socialist--as I am very familiar with this system. Along with the political parties, you can combine this with different types of governments. There are monarchies, democracies, dictatorships (and proletarian dictatorships for the communists.) The best part about government changes, is that the flag of a nation will change as well. For example; if Germany turned into a proletarian dictatorship, they would receive the flag of the DDR. While if they turned into a fascist dictatorship, they acquire the flag of the Third Reich (Kind of...) I love the political aspect of this game, and it is likely the one reason I constantly play this game.\n\n- Revolts: As I said, these are usually annoying to you in two ways. 1. They may be attacking your country. 2. They may be attacking a puppet/ally, and thus will tear your ties with that nation if overthrown. Now, on the other hand, rebels are truly what makes the game interesting. The Russians are defeated BADLY in a war, and communist rebels rise. They overthrow the Russian Empire and form the Soviet Union. If you ask me, that's pretty damn interesting! After 80 years of seeing the same old Russian Empire, it's nice seeing them throw out the red color and put on the classic hammer and sickle. How about Scottish rebels? Is it not interesting to see Scotland gain independence from the United Kingdom through violent means? There's both pros and cons to rebels. I personally have NO PROBLEM with rebels, ever. I just choose the socialist party loyalty national focus on my nation, let my nation turn more red, and I seem to be in good hands. Otherwise, if the rebels want to fight, I will go Rocky IV on them. So in other words... I love rebels.\n\n- The scramble for Africa: This is such a fun part of the game, but I feel that it mainly improved with the addition of the Heart of Darkness DLC. Throughout your game, you will notice that Africa is a mere wasteland of uncolonized land. There is generally nothing interesting that surrounds Africa until the 1870s, when the doors are unlocked and all great and secondary powers are given the green light to begin colonization. It's nothing short of a big race. Everyone wants to get their hands on the most land, and if you plan things out accordingly (like perhaps annexing Liberia before 1870) you can form a massive African empire. What you choose to do with your newly acquired African land is up to you. Use it for its resources, or release it all into one giant satellite nation. Overall, this is always an exciting event of any campaign.\n\n- Technological advancements: In 1870, everyone but the primitive nations essentially start off with the option to build infantry or cavalry, and that's about it. As for navy, you can build anything as simple as a clipper transport or frigate. As time goes on, however, and you research more, you will acquire much more advanced types of infantry and warships. I am personally a big fan of the tanks that are available in the early 20th century. More than tanks, however, I love the battleships. Nothing is more satisfying than having a battleship and spotting an enemy fleet of mere commerce raiders. It's simply too funny of a battle. Unfortunately, technology is not my favorite aspect of this game. I much prefer Hearts of Iron's system and I really wish they had implemented something similar in this game. While Victoria II has a wide variety of technology branches, I simply wish the decisions I make for research was as dynamic as it was in Hearts of Iron. I'm crossing my fingers that next time around, Victoria III (Not announced YET) will give you the option to completely focus on a specific part of the game. Considering I'm pro-navy, I would love if I could continue to improve the strengths of my battleships.\n\nIn conclusion, I love this game so much. Whenever I look at all of the other grand strategy games on Steam, I contemplate, and I cry. I leap into bed and soak my pillow with tears, understanding that there will never be another day where such a worthy game will hit the stores. ...but I'm just kidding. I love Europa Universalis IV a lot too.\n\nThis game is currently 75% off until September 8. A fair piece of warning, though. This review was written through the eyes of someone with both A House Divided and Heart of Darkness. While the vanilla game is $5, I highly recommend just grabbing the other two DLC to ensure that you feel you made a satisfying purchase.\n\n","September 5, 2014","true","665.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You lead a country through the era of colonialism (This is when we enslaved everyone that wasn't white. And the Irish.) and lead your nation to become the greatest power in the world. Of course you could play as one of the many nations of uncivilised brown people but who gives a toss about the filthy mudskins, not the good old British Empire, thats who! This game makes me feel warm in my special parts, after having to listen to all this social justice drivel it was fun to be rewarded for having white privilige. And by being rewarded I mean murdering and enslaving all non-whites because there is no better way to civilise the unwashed masses than with naval bombardment and Expeditionary Forces, of course you aren't supposed to kill other white pople though because that upsets everyone so make sure you load up a boat with some Guardsmen and send them to Africa so they can do their part for the White Man's Burden.","April 17, 2013","true","78.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Victoria II allows the player to play as any country founded before 1836 and continue to play as them until 1936 where the game ends.  There is the aspect of micromanaging  where the player has to control their economy, army, navy, research, etc. There is a steep learning curve but once you get how to play, the game is real simple. The pace of the game is moderate (singleplayer games take about 4 hours on normal, Multiplayer takes a couple of days).  The two DLC for the game makes gameplay much better but if your trying to play with other then they need the DLC as well.  The only problem with this game is starting multiplayer games. The only way for me and my friends to play together is to have Hamachi up and me port-forwarded. Other then that, the game is great for anyone who likes grand strategy.","December 25, 2014","true","316.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

HOWEVER saying that it (just as with all paradox games I have played) is a stunningly well made and authentic title and has improved hugely from the first Victoria game. It can be complex as it is highly political but you soon learn to just build a ton of factories and help the capitalists and aristocrats if you want to succeed.\n\nA political grand strategy game not a military one.

You play literally as any country from 1836, from the United States of Central America to the Free City of Kraków, and guide it through the Industrial era and the Victorian era.\n\nForge your destiny as you guide your nation through 100 years of industrialization, war, and colonization, vie for Great Power status and sign Alliances that at a split second, could be aimed at you, survive anarcho-liberal uprisings and anti-western partisans as you try to westernize as Japan. Along with nations that already exist, there are some that are relasable or formable; defeat the Russian Empire as Sweden and form Scandinavia, release Scotland from the United Kingdom and form your own Empire.  Play as Prussia and Form The North German Confederation, and then Germany, play as Two Sicilies and form Italy, play as France and become a giant blob, the choice is yours, for 100 years you are free to achieve your goals, and watch the world change, not even the AI choose the same path each time.\n\nWill the Communist Rebels in France take Paris and install their own government? Will the Anarcho-Liberal anarchists take power in Russia? Will America spread burgers throughout the world? Will the Soviet Union fall to Democratic Germany, will Fascist France continue its rivalry with Communist Britain? Will Australia become a Communist Global power and vie with Democratic New Zealand? Or will the Democratic Rebels in the West stutter the Aussies' Chances? Will the Irish Rebels beat back the British units and declare independence? Will Liberia colonize all of Africa before the scramble even starts? Will Texas annex Mexico? Will the California Republic invade Hawaii? Will the CSA end the Civil war with a Stalemate? Will the CSA come begging to the USA again for Union? Will Poland into space? Will Bolivia into Coastline? Will Switzerland sit on its bum and watch the world go by? Will China industrialize and defeat the Western industry? Will Russia keep Alaska? Will Jews elect a facist party in Israel? I'm not certain, but all of this is possible in Victoria 2.\n\nPro's:\n+Balanced combat, as well as a nice amount of units (not too many, not too little) and provide nice costumization of forces\n+Great powers and secondary powers make the game feel more real\n+ Neat political system (upperhouse, elections and reforms)\n+ Factory system\n+ Attention to detail: Each country has its own flags for Monarchy, Republic, Fascist and Communist. And most countries have flavour events.\n+ You can change history\n\nCon´s:\n- Steep learning curve\n\nOverall rating: 14/15 (Must own for history nerds and strategy gamers)","June 27, 2015","true","271.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After I did this fix the game runs fine now YAY!  Now I can get busy on the game and post a review about the game itself once i've played it enough.\n\nOk now after I have reviewed the full tutorial and played my first game I am going to post a real review.\n\nI decided to go over the whole tutorial before playing, I figured it wouldn't all stick one time through (it is a lot) but I would get a general clue as to everything in the game. The game does have a steep learning curve, but after my first try I say it's worth it. It's a very involving game trying to really run everything in a country.  Politics, Industry, Income, Population, army and Technolgy.\n\nI did try to move a little too fast in acquiring new territory and got myself in hot water and ended up losing. But, I had so much fun trying to keep my people happy and budget balanced along with trying to build up infrastructure that I can't wait to try again. I will be going over a few things in the tutorial first. I haven't played with the DLC content as yet. But, I highly recommend this game if you love in depth strategy and don't mind actually having to do tutorials and maybe watch some videos too.","August 27, 2014","true","15.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","6"

If you buy it, play with the Pop demand mod, which makes it really better and adds hundreds of events for pretty much every country (including Brazil :D). Also, like pretty much every paradox game, you kinda have to buy it with all the expansions, the last one (heart of darkness) is very good and the crisis system is pretty AWESOME. This game is the perfect game if you want to reenact the wars of the last half of the 19th century to the first world war. (after that, obviously go with Hearts of Iron 3). The map in here is also way better than, for example, Hoi3. I cant stand to watch South America in HoI3, its like a kid had made it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaptorX2000/recommended/42960/","RaptorX2000","Raptor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaptorX2000/","55 products in account","Victoria II is a grand strategy game from Paradox Interactive, the same company that created Europa Universalis, Crusader Kings, and Hearts of Iron. The game is easy to learn to play, but challenging to master. It features very complex inner-workings that can take a very long time to fully understand, but players willing to tackle the challnges this game brings will be entertained for hundreds of hours.\n\nIn a nutshell, Victoria II gives the player command of any country on earth in the century from 1836 to 1936. It is a game based on history, but it is not an historical simulation. Expect weird things to occur, like a communist revolution in Texas, a globe-spanning Greek Empire, or a fascist Brunei launching devastating wars of conquest in every continent.\n\nThe player's role in the game is to ensure their country's success or dominance. Like other Paradox games, you cannot "win" or "lose". There are no standardized goals, like "Conquer 50 provinces" or "Destroy Such-And-Such". Rather, you  do whatever you want to see your country and its population thrive (or collapse into total anarchy and civil war, if that's your thing). You can use any number of tools to see your country grow, from cajoling other states into joining your "sphere of influence", to forcing them in at the tip of your sword; from encouraging immigration to your lands, to conquering more populated lands; from building titanic industrial machines, to dispersing protesting strikers dragging down your titanic industrial machine. Warfare forms the core of the game, with economic and political concerns filling in the peacetime. You'll often find yourself invading other territories to secure access to an important resource your factories need, otherwise those factories will go out of business and uppity, hungry workers will insist on throwing your Absolutely-Monarchical ♥♥♥ out on the street to watch in the cold while they establish a Dictatorship of the Proletariat.\n\nThe game is intricate and difficult to master, but the online community will help you overcome most of the impediments. There is also still something of a modding community, impressive after 4 years. The existing mods are quite fun to play, greatly enhancing aspects of the game or setting it in different eras. All in all, 9/10.","December 11, 2014","true","227.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though Civ and Total War pretend they've made improvements in diplomacy, they still really only come down to killing everyone else.\nYou will not jump into this game and eradicate the lesser countries.  What you can do... is subjugate them under your nation, push your influence, and try and form the nations of Italy, Germany, etc... out of the smaller city states.  Or if your citizens live in a state owned by another nation (such as Greece and the Aegis Islands being owned by the Ottomans), you can through some sneakery diplomacy take them with no bloodshed, or even get the major world powers to do the dirty work for you if you need some early weak undeveloped nations to colonize but lack the resources to mobilize yourself.\nThere's a definite learning curve, but luckily there's Youtube to show you what the heck you're doing.\n\nNow that I've given it a second chance and know better what to expect from it, I definitely see what everyone meant about this being the 'big boy game' that you move to when you grow up from Civ (not that I dislike Civ at all).","December 29, 2014","true","151.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I look at how many hours I've poured into this game and I scare myself every single time, because it's mindboggling. I love this games mechanics and overall point: shaping history as you would like it. There is something about the United Kingdom invading the United States and taking New England from them that just makes me laugh at how different things would and could be. The only complaints I have with this game, and the accompanying DLCs, is that the game is not taken far enough in some aspects, and too far in others. Also, the tutorial is rather dull. When it comes to political, social, and diplomatic mechanics, the game has not been taken far enough. Adding several mechanics, like they have in several MODs I have seen and heard about, as well as what Creative Assembly did in EUIV, would improve the game greatly. The Trade tab interface, is rather pointless, and if anything shouldn't be there. If it is retained, it should be further mainstreamed in how it operates, but the amount of goods, should be further expanded. All in all, I am impressed with this game, very, very impressed. I give it a strong 9.25/10, and with the enhancements I mentioned, it would be an immediate 10/10.","December 2, 2013","true","745.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The depth of the game is extraordinary; you can choose to follow a nation's path through history or change it to your liking. The diplomacy, economics, and warfare in the game feel very realistic, especially as the game progresses into the modern era. The learning curve is steep but the process is quite entertaining. A House Divided and Heart of Darkness offer so many improvements to the game, such as the international crisis system and the ability to begin the campaign at the outbreak of the American Civil War.

(This review is abit long hue hue)\n\nThe game starts off at the peak of the industrial revolution. The world is pushed into this great leap that no one has ever seen before. Smoke rises from the newly built factories. Railroad tracks can be seen in almost every part of the globe, connecting city after city. Warfare has now changed into a more deadlier way. The old wooden ships are now replaced by steam-propelled warships protected by iron or steel plates. It is the early 19th century, and thus a new age is born.\n\nVictoria II is a game for those who love grand strategy games and (most importantly) history. This game will blow your mind because of the depth of gameplay that the dev's put into this game.\n\nDiplomacy, History, Politics, Warfare, Technology, and even Economy can be seen in this game. Every player has his/her own style of play. You can play as Great Britain and just colonize every part of the world that is not colonized yet. You can be Prussia and unite all the german people into one banner. You can be Denmark and try to make Scandinavia for yourself. You can be any nation you want in this game's time period.\n\nThis is one of those games that makes you think hard on what to do next. Maybe rise the taxes? Make war to all your neighbors? Take on the Great Powers of the World and try to make them step down from their outstanding greatness? Forge an empire which will humiliate the United Kingdom? Make the richest nation of the world? Isolate yourself from wars or be neutral, like Switzerland? Maintain a monarchy that controls the whole country? It is up to you on how you play your country in Victoria II.\n\nIm giving this game a 9/10. Game is amazing but there are times that the AI is just a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nGrab this game now or in a steam sale. I suggest you get the complete version of the game because its complete and has the awesome uniforms that germany used before and during the years of World War One (which I personally love).","April 19","true","32.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

That's what VicII is like -  an incredibly original, balanced and fun game that's just so, so deeply flawed.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it's my favourite paradox game (or possibly my favourite game altogether) - there are no other games with this level of depth that just work so well. When everything goes right in VicII - you've made it to the 20th century, you're a great power and you're having an arms race preparing for a great war - it feels completely perfect.\n\nI can't think of another game where the actual *gameplay* changes naturally over time. When machine guns, trench warfare and indirect fire artillery have been developed by about 1890, there's no popup saying "Wars are fought statically now!". It just happens to be that to win a war after that point, you have to stop massing your troops into large armies and start lining them along your borders. You're not *forced* to do this, it's just that the bonuses to defence are so high that you have no choice.\n\nSimilarly, the economy and politics goes from being a trivial backwater of your country to completely dominating everything you do. By the end of the game factories are absolutely *crucial* and you'll be bending over backwards to get everything working the way you want. Politics goes from completely conservative dominated to a nightmare - by the end of the game, fascist, jacobin and communist revolutions are bulk standard. And if you have a communist revolution, for example, the way you play the game has to adapt dramatically (micro-managing your economy can be a damn nightmare). In the 100 years Vic II covers, you inevitably go from being in control of your economy and your population to being terrified of them - effective strategy becomes absolutely essential to achieving your goals.\n\nSo in terms of general strategic depth, this game is absolutely unrivaled. The flaws however, are myriad. Vic II was made before Paradox miraculously got good at programming games with CKII; despite being released in 2009 the graphics feel they came from about 10 years earlier. The game is *slow*. If your economy hasn't kicked off and you're not fighting a war, this is a waiting game. The first 30 years of a non-western country are even worse - the westernizing process is basically just several hours of sitting around doing absolutely nothing. The game *does* pick up towards its last half - but the first half can be really, damningly boring.\n\nThere are also some major gameplay flaws that really, really break the immersion, e.g the definition of a 'great power' as the top 8 scoring countries. While this is fine in itself, 'score' takes into account prestige as much as it does military strength. It's pretty normal to see Russia lose its great power status due to a lack of prestige and be overtaken by Belgium, Bavaria or Switzerland. And then, come 1890 the first 'Great War' starts with Germany, France, Italy, and the USA on one side and Belgium and Switzerland on the other - which is an *entirely* game ruining experience. A great war is *supposed* to be a cataclysmic war that goes on for years and years and reshapes the world in the process - when it ends after a month when Germany simply walks its troops into Belgium, it feels really, really dumb.\n\nI have some other pet peeves - for example, the way the USA is hard-coded to get way more immigrants than everybody else - even other large colonial nations like Mexico or Brazil. This means that the Americas are incredibly predictable, every game. Not once have I seen something happen other than the USA becoming a top great power with the entire continent in its sphere. It's just really really dull. There's no way to play as Mexico or Brazil and try to rival the USA for dominance of the area. With that one move Paradox cut off half the world from ever being interesting.\n\nSo yeah. It's a brilliant game that will drive you up the walls out of frustration. It's definitely worth playing, but holy ♥♥♥♥ I hope Vic III is better than this.","December 15, 2014","true","380.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

Vicky 2 is my favorite because of the staggering amount of nation control available to play around with.  Other reviews do a better job of detailing it, but I have found the system addictively complex but never overly-complicated.  The ability to automate trade is helping me get my feet wet without overwhelming me, and I can't wait to start messing around in there either.

This period was also a brutal peroid of mechanical warfare with massive established nations fighting global wars.\n\nAlthough the other Paradox games like EU4 and CK2 are all unique in themselves I do find them a little bit repetitive because the gameplay a matter of witnessing new events and fighting wars, there is often not that much to do when not in conflict otherwise. CK2 has the advantage of a great intrigue system and EU4 has lovely graphics and GUI, but this Victoria 2 game has depth! It keeps you thinking on your feet all the way through to the late game and so far I have not had any time when I havent had a lot to do.\n\nSo for me Victoria 2 is the Paradox game I love the most, I think its the only game where I cant see any gameplay flaws at all, I love the era, and I love the depth of the game which is unrivalled in any strategy game I have played to date.\n\nWatch Quill18's Japan Vic2 game on Youtube and I dare you not be be intrigued.","February 26, 2014","true","50.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike Hearts of Iron (Warefare-based) and Europa Universalis (colonisation and exploration-based), Victoria II's focus is on domestic politics and industry.  I  like this game a lot. I like how the power structure of Great Power,teh 8 most powerful coountries in the world, Secondary Power, the the 9-16 most powerful countries, Civilized, and Uncivilized Powers, raned on if  they are westernized or not, is set up. Great powers in the game do what you'd expect a top notch colonial power, like the UK or France, to do. They can push around everyone below them. They can do whatever they want at almost any time. The secondary powers, like Mexico or Sardinia-Piedmont, can colonize and compete with the great powers at times, but cant push people around like a great power. A civilized nation, like Bolivia or Parma, are at the bottom of the civilized world. These are the countries that great powers  mostly try to fight for influence over. They may be the weakest, but some can still have a powerfull industrial and military arm compared to their regional rivals. The Uncivilized, like Oman or Siam, nations are the very bottom of the totem pole of the world's geo-political landscape. They have little power and can be pushed around quite easily (except China). Most are very weak compred to everyone else militarily and industrially. Thes countries are also at the mercy of colonization. They are also fought after by great powers.\n\nAnother thing i like is how the game makes you use different elements of your population. Each strata (farmers, craftsman, solders, etc) have a different use which are self-explanitory. a couple uses include, craftsman and clerks: they work in your factories, Beurocrats: help administration efficientcy.\n\nThe military system n the game is a bit basic, but like I said in the beginning, it's not primarily a wargame. National ideas are another thing i like because they give certain bonuses to the regions you put one in. THis game also has a decent trech tree. Different nations are better at researchng different parts of the tech tree (Prussia gets a bonus with the army and industry trees and a disadvantage with navy and culture trees).\n\nEach game has its own pros and cons. This game, in my opinion, has pros that outway the cons.","July 7, 2014","true","240.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieatyourhead/recommended/42960/","ieatyourhead","Ieatyourhead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ieatyourhead/","82 products in account","In Victoria 2, you play as a nation for 100 years, starting in 1836.\n\nThe game primarily revolves around the "pops" (a simulation of your population), who can have various jobs, purchase goods, and migrate around the world. As you play the game, you'll be industrializing your country by researching techs, building factories, and conquering other (usually less advanced) areas of the world in order to procure goods for your factories. You also have to deal with the various political ideologies which will cause your subjects to demand various government reforms, or even to openly revolt in order to attempt to enforce whatever ideology they follow (democratic reforms, communism, etc.).\n\nPros:\n-fun to see an alternate history play out\n-pop system is well done and adds a human character to the game\n-interesting events, but not so many big random ones as in other games, so overall there is less luck at play\n-mod support. there are some excellent mods available which flesh out the game even more.\n\nCons:\n-some parts of the economy simulator are kind of strange. it works ok, but feels a little unrealistic at times.\n-combat involves dice rolls, which imo is not the greatest thing. That being said they don't have an overwhelming effect so it isn't too luck based\n-doesn't have very good UI, which can be confusing.\n-AI can be somewhat stupid in certain situations.\n\nOverall I would recomend this game to anyone who likes longer and slower strategy games. Some important things to note for anyone interested in playing this are:\n\n1. Like all paradox games, there is no real set objective, and you are expected to set your own goals. There is a ranking system which makes it more possible to feel like you "won" by getting to the #1 spot, but it's not like say Civilization with victory conditions. If you prefer a more focused objective, this may not be the game for you.\n\n2. Be sure to purchase all the expansions. Unlike some later releases like Crusader Kings, where each new DLC is accompanied by a free patch, many of the expansions for this contain fixes to balance and such. You can still have fun without them of course, but the game may be a little strange.\n\n3. The interface is a bit complicated and can feel a bit overwhelming initially. Combined with the fact that there is no "winning", you may begin to feel like you are just sitting there doing nothing when you first play. My advice is to quickly go through the menus to get an idea of your options, and after that, don't worry about it too much and just start playing. You will likely make some stupid mistakes but overall you should be fine as long as you are playing a decently powerful country. Also, try to set smaller objectives as you go along rather than setting some huge goal at the start - this will keep things less stressful for your first game.","June 29, 2014","true","210.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of all the Paradox grand strategy games, Victoria II makes me feel most like a real, historical leader, with more methods of expansion that just military conquest, as other titles such as EU III and EU IV can feel like. The expansions are also great, with Heart of Darkness' Great War mechanic really making wars between Great Powers feel meaty and fulfilling. The game can sometimes be a little ridiculous, (such as Russia demanding Scotland as part of a peace deal with the United Kingdom, and African colonial empires often looking like random, intertwined shapes than chosive colonial territories) but the expansions again fix most of these issues with nations taking huge infamy hits for taking regions they have no claim on, and also requiring a valid reason for delaring war in the first place.\n\nOn the whole, this game feels very rewarding. Your decisons feel as though they have real concequences, and no two playthroughs are the same. The learning curve is not too steep (compared to say Hearts of Iron III), meaning a few trial games will allow you to know most of the games mechanics. In conclusion, an excellent game, still being supported by the developers, that I always come back to, despite numerous other Paradox strategy games being released since its initial relsease.","February 20, 2014","true","140.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it can and does exist as a war game, the game also painstakingly details the political life of a country, and ties it to scientific discovery, economic growth and turmoil, and ethnic strife. The game begins in 1836--when the world is rural, religious, and disconnected. It ends in 1936, when democracy, communism and fascism are using radio and film to fight for the hearts and minds of millions of people.\n\nNation-states like Germany and Italy (as well as some that never existed like Scandanavia) can be formed as much by shrewd political maneuvering as by military might. Some countries like Russia, Brazil and China are very difficult to play simply because of their own internal problems, and a new player might spend much of the game fighting reactionaries and revolutionaries that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economic and scientific growth. Other countries like France, Japan and the USA feel almost too easy, and you wonder why the USA didn't do even better than it did in real life. It also allows you to ponder vastly different (yet ostensibly possible) histories like:\n\n-A democratic Russia\n-China as a great power by 1920 with the world's largest economy\n-A communist United States\n-Austria forming Greater Germany\n-Panjab uniting India in the late 1800s under Sikhism\n-The Ottomans surviving as a federated multicutural state\n\n...et cetera. I even revamped Liberia's infrastructure and education early on and went on to conquer half of Africa by 1910.\n\nThe biggest problem with Victoria 2 is that with so many variables that interact with one another, the game still isn't completely fine tuned. This small amount of error becomes noticeable when you have 90% of your population joining in an Anarcho-Liberal (i.e. Libertarian) uprising. The mods available on Paradox's forums fix a lot of these issues as well as revamping and adding gameplay. If you like simulators like SimCity, strategy games like Civilization, or any developments between 1836 and 1936, buy this game.","February 27, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While it can and does exist as a war game, the game also painstakingly details the political life of a country, and ties it to scientific discovery, economic growth and turmoil, and ethnic strife. The game begins in 1836--when the world is rural, religious, and disconnected. It ends in 1936, when democracy, communism and fascism are using radio and film to fight for the hearts and minds of millions of people.\n\nNation-states like Germany and Italy (as well as some that never existed like Scandanavia) can be formed as much by shrewd political maneuvering as by military might. Some countries like Russia, Brazil and China are very difficult to play simply because of their own internal problems, and a new player might spend much of the game fighting reactionaries and revolutionaries that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ economic and scientific growth. Other countries like France, Japan and the USA feel almost too easy, and you wonder why the USA didn't do even better than it did in real life. It also allows you to ponder vastly different (yet ostensibly possible) histories like:\n\n-A democratic Russia\n-China as a great power by 1920 with the world's largest economy\n-A communist United States\n-Austria forming Greater Germany\n-Panjab uniting India in the late 1800s under Sikhism\n-The Ottomans surviving as a federated multicutural state\n\n...et cetera. I even revamped Liberia's infrastructure and education early on and went on to conquer half of Africa by 1910.\n\nThe biggest problem with Victoria 2 is that with so many variables that interact with one another, the game still isn't completely fine tuned. This small amount of error becomes noticeable when you have 90% of your population joining in an Anarcho-Liberal (i.e. Libertarian) uprising. The mods available on Paradox's forums fix a lot of these issues as well as revamping and adding gameplay. If you like simulators like SimCity, strategy games like Civilization, or any developments between 1836 and 1936, buy this game.","February 27, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of all the Paradox grand strategy games, Victoria II makes me feel most like a real, historical leader, with more methods of expansion that just military conquest, as other titles such as EU III and EU IV can feel like. The expansions are also great, with Heart of Darkness' Great War mechanic really making wars between Great Powers feel meaty and fulfilling. The game can sometimes be a little ridiculous, (such as Russia demanding Scotland as part of a peace deal with the United Kingdom, and African colonial empires often looking like random, intertwined shapes than chosive colonial territories) but the expansions again fix most of these issues with nations taking huge infamy hits for taking regions they have no claim on, and also requiring a valid reason for delaring war in the first place.\n\nOn the whole, this game feels very rewarding. Your decisons feel as though they have real concequences, and no two playthroughs are the same. The learning curve is not too steep (compared to say Hearts of Iron III), meaning a few trial games will allow you to know most of the games mechanics. In conclusion, an excellent game, still being supported by the developers, that I always come back to, despite numerous other Paradox strategy games being released since its initial relsease.","February 20, 2014","true","140.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the last game Paradox made before they changed their development process for CK2 so it suffers a but from the 'Old Paradox' ways of having the sequential expansions that act as patches. With Heart of Darkness, it's very good, though its one expansion away from really becoming as excellent as EU3 was and CK2 is and EU4 will be. It's based in a fascinating period of history and it's my favorite setting for a Paradox game because you can get the sense of the world shifting massively throughout the time period. From post-Napleonic squabbles over random crap, to the heyday of colonizing Africa and building railroads across the West, to the chaos and horror of the Great War and fascist/communist takeovers, Victoria covers it all. I really wish that we get a Victoria 3 of the same quality as CK2 and EU4 and that it comes with a EU4-V3 converter.","December 1, 2013","true","29.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unfortunately, I originally purchased this on the Gamestop PC App (because bargain-hunting) and Gamestop didn't offer Steam keys for it until a while after my purchase. In any case, here's the review.\n\nVictoria II is one of my favorite Paradox strategy games. It holds the distinction of being the oldest game which I continue to play, even if that is tied to its current lack of a sequel. Why, other than that, is this the game that I still play? It's hard to say, but I think that it captures its time period very well. When you build an empire in Europa Universalis, there are time periods when you have a strong sense of historical belonging, but that can't last throughout the whole game. The same can be said for Crusader Kings, which now has a ridiculously expanded timeline thanks to DLC. Victoria, on the other hand, is the Victorian Era encapsulated. Whether you dominate your foes on the mainland or "discover" vast swaths of land in Africa and the Pacific, you feel like a Victorian leader. It's a tremendous time period to experience, and an even more tremendous time to be a European Power, or an up-and-coming uncivilized nation like Japan (which will pretty much become a Great Power whether you help it or not). I reccomend it to all strategy game fans: it's probably my favorite Paradox game... subjectively speaking.","February 16, 2015","true","113.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The're missing few things to improve and make this game more interesting. But you will see them when you play it by yourself.\n\nIt is even better when you have all DLCS. Without DLCS the game keeps being boring beacuse you can't try new things.\n\nThis game is really worth any peny. Belive me if you are fan of CK2 and EU4 then you need to get this game. The gameplay is little bit different but you'll will get used to it.\n\nThe game only misses updates and bug fixes. But when you count it all, this game is truly amazing!

The vanilla game is poor, very buggy and crashes often. With the dlcs and latest updates it is stable and an absolutely incredible game. For a lot of players this is too complicated, which I don't understand. Maybe for Civ players and below. With mods it goes from being an incredible game to being the best grand strategy game I have ever played. There is so much replayabilty, obviously because of the huge amount of nations and less obviously because of the huge amount of choices you have in the game. 10/10, recommend it to anyone who likes GSG games.","August 23, 2015","true","9.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It covers every aspect of the era. Some of those aspects including Industrialization, New Imperialism. Nationalism and the beginning of modern day revolutionist ideas and tactics. When I play Victoria II I feel a bond with the nation I'm playing. I almost develop a temporary sense of nationalism, wanting to further my nation to sitting in the #1 great power spot that it deserves to be in. If a grand strategy game can be so in depth that it makes me feel like I'm actually in the leader's position then the devolopers made this game right. This game perfectly represents the time period and also has educational value. When I played my first run as Prussia using the Historical Project Mod (I would highly recommend this mod. It completely revamps the game to more accurately represent the time period and it also improves many of the statistics and balances the game better.) I often found myself looking into the nation's history and many key decisions the leaders made to form the German Empire. Currently as I'm writing this review I have 536 hours in Victoria II and I only plan to see that number go higher as I continue to play this amazing game.","January 30","true","601.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For instance, it has a fairly steep learning curve. More importantly, however, is that there are too many restrictions on the player. For example, your hand is often tied by the policies of the ruling political party in your country. If a laissez faire party is running things then you’ll have to pray that your country’s capitalists think a tank factory would be profitable because you won’t be able to order one yourself. If the ruling party is pacifists then you won’t be able to pile on extra demands in your peace treaties. Also, there are too many restrictions to prevent warmongering which I disapprove of. Let us act like Napoleon or Hitler and watch the world come together to destroy us.\n\nThat being said I really like it because it handles internal politics very well and you can play as any country that existed between 1836 and 1936 (even Texas). So consider this a recommendation if you like grand strategy games.\n","August 31, 2014","true","341.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sirlion/recommended/42960/","Sirlion","Sirlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sirlion/","91 products in account","Victoria II is, by all standards of modern gaming, a classic. It combines the ease of use and adaptability of past Paradox games with a dynamic, mildly fast paced action on the strategic map. Tons of decisions and political choices to make, an enthrilling political system, cool classic scenarios for the time period 1836-1936 with a very fluid flow of events. I would reccomend this title to newcomers and veterans alike, as it is one rare gem of a game these days, one that keeps you interested, engaged and involved in the action both from an industrial / economical standpoint and a more political / military one. The one rule for newcomers: DONT PANIC. It will be an experience that, in time, will most certainly grant anybody a fun time in one of History's most interesting boiling points. Play one of the major factions in the world or strive for freedom as one of the smaler ones, while reforming, adapting to the shift into the modern era, or try to destroy the seemingly untouchable spread of nationalism to remain on your Imperial seat.\nWhat more do you need?","January 7","true","53.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I hadn't even downloaded the extra content for the game itself.\nStep 1 - Start up the game without the two major DLCs. There should be a download.\nStep 2 - Add one of the DLCs. Let it download.\nStep 3 - Remove that DLC, add the other, let it download.\nStep 4 - Add back both DLCs.

This game has many realistic situations and options the allow for countless hours of gameplay. Ofter times, I think to myself "Where did my entire day go" while playing. Granted that overall the game is amazing, it does have some flaws. Rebels are a serious issue that Paradox desperately needs to fix in Victoria III (if we ever get it). I'll go over some general pros and cons of this game:\n\nPROS\n-Great gameplay\n-Pick any country and guide them through history (or alternate history)\n-Great powers have a ton of decisions\n-Easy to mod\n-TONS of great/fun mods to play\n-Mods patch issues with the vanilla game\n-Every country offers a different expirience\n\nCONS\n-Rebels arouse too often and in way to large numbers (I've had over 3/4 of my population become rebels)\n-Populations are unrealistic (China is the only country exceeding 1 million population)\n-The warscore is broken (Warscore measures how well you are doing in a war and the higher it is, the better deals you can get during a peaceoffer. However, sometimes you will be over the required warscore and the country will not surrender even if you have 100% of their provinces under your control.)\n-Countries with a low starting literacy rate fall far behind in technology\n-The UK never leaves the #1 spot on the country ranking\n-Rebels don't make sense (for example, after you formed Germany you will get "Prussian Nationalists" which want to liberate Prussia from Germany. Historically, it was Prussia and the Prussian people who wanted to form Germany in the first place.)\n\n***THERE ARE MODS THAT FIX A LOT OF THE CONS/ISSUES***\n\n","April 13, 2014","true","196.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can't say that I have played much of it yet, but I have played a lot of Hearts of Iron III as Germany, France, UK, Soviets, and the US. What I learned from HOI3 is not only is the US the player to be, but starting in 1936 is NOT early enough. That realization has led me to V2. In 1836 the US has not yet reached the goal of Manifest Destiny. The West is still wild, much of it held by Mexico. The Civil War has not been fought, and the goal that I have as the US player is to avoid it altogether. The Grand Campaign extends right through the First World War. Instead of practicing isolationist policies, I want to see the US become "world cop" as soon as possible. Taking that position in HOI3 worked for me, and I want to see that approach work in this game. For me the biggest mistake of World War II occured in 1936 when the US and the Allies let the fascists overthrow Republican Spain. Defending Spain would have made the Allied position MUCH stronger in 1940. Similarly, avoiding the Civil War would have made the US much stronger in the next century.","April 5, 2014","true","10.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Gameplay is superb and it is very polished, Victoria 2 allows you to rule great and powerful empires like France, Great britain, and the US to the tiny nations of Belgium, Orangje, and Portgual. The military part of Victoria 2 is very well done with you commanding huge armies to attack a certain enemy and then annex,humiliate, or acquire lost (or gain) territory.  The politics and ecomomy part of the game is funny and interesting, as in a Communist America, Democratic Russia, and Empire of Brazil. However the AI is tough and kinda dumb, but will fight you. Overall Victoria 2 is a game you need to buy FOR $20 us dollars or 12 pounds.\n\nEdit- I recommend you get the Expansion packs A House Divided and A Heart of Darkness, both of which add even more gameplay than the base game. Also if you are going to play Multiplayer, I get and use Hamachi as the Victoria 2 Paradox servers are non- existant.","January 2, 2014","true","588.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Anyone interested interested in history, grand strategy, or even politics will enjoy the time spent playing this game. Victoria II requires a bit of work to master, the tutorials help but it really comes down to trial and error. The game doesn't attempt to hold your hand when it comes to core gameplay. Balancing a countries budget means making decisions that have wide reaching consequences and effects. Keeping a countries income positive while producing more goods than your rivals and still maintaining both an army and a navy to defend your interests is quite a challenge. All in all this is a great strategy game, if you enjoy other paradox titles you surely get some enjoyment out of it.","May 23","true","124.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

A big part of the game is guiding your nation through its industrial revolution and transitioning from an economy that relies on skilled craftsmen to one that can sustain huge factories. The game does a good job of creating a dynamic interaction between the economy, politics, and society. Don't expect too much of an overt narrative though - as in Europa Universalis, the story of your nation will be created through numbers, charts, and events. How you frame the story relies mostly on your own imagination - kind of like making your own head canon. Notable challenges include recreating Japan's rise to power through the Meiji Restoration, weathering the American Civil War, and building the British Empire. There's plenty of room to break history too! Fans of the Crusader Kings or Europa Univeralis series will know that Paradox is really good at creating systems that allow you to have fun rewriting history. You can create a communist United Kingdom, fight for Indian or Southeast Asian independence and industrial power, or build an empire to resist the Western colonization of Africa. Some histories are harder to rewrite than others - but this is a game that rewards practice and experience, and with enough of those almost anything is possible.\n\nVictoria II comes with a "brick wall" style learning curve - if you've played Europa Universalis before and can remember what it was like to first learn how to be good at that game, expect to experience that again. I'm still not very good at this game with only 14 hours registered, but it's fun (despite the frustration) to learn a new system. If you don't like feeling frustrated, I suggest looking up tutorials online because this game's systems are very complex for a newcomer. On the other hand, if you like learning new things and don't mind feeling like a total idiot, or if you don't mind having to scrap whole games' worth of progress to start over, then just dive in and experiment. Trust me, the game will let you know when you've lost. The huge variety of settings and the specific challenges that different nations face ensure that you'll never be lacking inspiration for a new game.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to create a Romanian superpower to unite the Balkan states.","December 28, 2014","true","14.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is very dense and complex, it is not just a get resources & build an army game. You don´t need to farm or pick stone and gold like most strategy games, but you have to deal with politics instead, economy and a fair amount of diplomacy, even so, it's easy to play when you are already familiar with strategy games.\n\nThe bad: You got to press a button to create every single unit of the army, making it a pain when you need a big army, and that's mostly certain if you want to dominate the scene.\n\n* Some historical facts should be more accurate.\n\n","June 20, 2014","true","73.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Bohemia-Moravia has cried out for independence and I, Great Britain, have answered their call. To my surprise, France and Russia joined Austria-Hungary in keeping Bohemia-Moravia oppressed. This will be a great war.\n\nBy the year 1910, my nation had built the first tank, aeroplane, and vehicle factories. Out production was the third best in the world, but our manpower....Our manpower was unmatched. As the nation grew, I did everything I could to make my population love their home. I wanted immigrants and did anything I could to attract them. My government became liberal, and even though my military spending is lower due to the "anti-military" liberal policy, my population is the highest by 65 million.\n\nThe sheer number and quality of Great Britains soldiers have allowed me to take northern France and defend India from Russia. However, France has gas, and I have no defense against gas. I have lost double the men that France. While I am winning the war, I may not be if my researchers can't formulate a defense soon.\n\nThis is Victoria 2. Probably one of, if not the most amazing game I've ever played.","January 4, 2014","true","64.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Before buying the steam version I had a physical copy which I got for free from a deal. It had both Victoria II + A House Divided and Victoria I + Revolutions. What made me buy the steam version was that I could not enhance the retail edition with Heart of Darkness which is a must for a full Vicky experience. I just wasn't sure if the copy of HoD I could buy was compatible with it. Go figure, I bought the steam version alongside two DLCs. No regrets.\n\nBefore you actually think of buying this or any other Paradox developed game you must take one thing into consideration.\nParadox grand strategies are known for their rather steep-learning curve  I'm looking at you, Hearts of Iron III...	 and rather confusing interface . While the tutorial might sort of give you a little pat to the right way it's possible that you may want to look up a guide on YouTube, as the former doesn't cover some important topics such as  Colonizing	 which plays a vital role in becoming a great power later on. After you know what the hell you're doing you will really enjoy this game. It's fun to lead your country becoming a contender in the ever so harsher competition for world dominance.

Evntually I satrt a new game go with U.K and play as Canada. I got anihilated by the U.S and U.K is doing nothing so I am not doing that again, unless I were to make a mod doing something about that... Well after that I tried Japan, after the first try with them I had Korea and parts of Arabia, then stopped playing Japan for whatever reason. Then I tried Siam, I got beaten by the Chinese for expanding right next to them.\n\nThen I try South America because Risk logic. Argentina, Chile, and Brazil are so good in my opinion. Now playing as these countries I ought to pay attention to Infamy since the one time I was Brazil and went too far then everyone declares war on me, never played Brazil again. So Argentina ends up being my favourite country and is the first thing I mod and I made infamy nothing to worry about by giving me cores, and then I formed a new nation just because mods, flags never work in my mods for some amount of reasons. Well I end up being a nation that has the lands of Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and poor ol' Bolivia. I remember the one time I made a game allied with everyone in South America except for Bolivia and made a non-reasonable crusade against them, five years later I just annex them then betray just about everyone in the south of South America.\n\nNow I have tried Mexico a few times and none of the times have I succesfully taken Texas, one time I have complete control over Texas but then U.S interferes nearly last second, I really want to make mods that will make the U.S not so full of military power. Also the only reason why I would ever suport C.S.A.\n\nWell this is my experience on the game but to make this an actual review, the game isn't all world domination like I originally thought, no instead you wait for Cassus-Belli I think it's called and then you decide if you want to declare war without gaining infamy, or go ahead and get infamy it's really up to you. Being a Great Power gives you a great advantage when it comes to diplomacy, sometimes it can be fun to get a lot of money coming in and just looking through the wars supporting whichever side by giving war subsidies. Sometimes it's hard to industrialize most likely because you're political party won't pay for building factories, well if your a HM government you can change to some party that will let you or somehow get a revolt and change governments that way. It can be fun colonising but the French are just too quick with colonising in my opinion. Playing as a low country can be fun as a challenge yet it is frustrating, especially when some country annihilates your only hopes of winning wars. Encouragement is useful yet I feel as if it is something barely thought of.\n\nWell that's pretty much all, my advice would be if you're going against an uncivilized nation or country, whatever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibreakthingz/recommended/42960/","ibreakthingz","Carlos V","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibreakthingz/","7 products in account","Victoria II is a grand strategy game which spans one hundred years of history, from 1836 to 1936. The game allows a player to start as any nation which existed in 1836 (or 1861, if the DLC "A House Divided" has been downloaded and installed, and yes, that includes the CSA). The player can explore any avenue that they wish to pursue for achieving the lofty goal of "Great Power" status. One can dominate the Industrial Revolution(s) by becoming a factory-filled powerhouse; conquer every nation around them through decades of war; colonize Africa, Asia, and the Pacific islands; or skillfully manipulate their scientific progress and culture to become one of the most advanced nations on the planet.\n\nNone of this, however, is in any way easy. Victoria II's excellence comes at the cost of enormous complexity. It can be daunting for a new player to memorize the various intricacies of economics, politics, diplomacy, and the like. Furthermore, the game is built to accurately simulate the chosen time period, and that means that rival nations will attempt to check the player at every turn. Your population's happiness and your national budget are also large concerns. Money is difficult to come by without hard work (or cheesing the system), and if the general populace finds itself outraged by your decisions one too many times, they'll take up arms and demonstrate to you why our modern world has so few monarchies anymore. Whatever goal you set your sights on, you will have to fight for it. It make take a long time to gain enough experience to excel at this game.\n\nThat doesn't mean that Victoria II isn't a fun game. On the contrary. It's an incredibly fun game. The thrills of just barely beating a rival to that last colonial province, starting as a small country and forming a larger nation like Italy or Germany, or just messing around with history in general are what give Victoria II its charm. No game is ever exactly the same, so each campaign is a new adventure. Who knows what might happen? Maybe Sweden will become a global communist superpower. Maybe Mexico will start the Second World War by invading Greek Nigeria. Maybe Afghanistan will become world-renowned for its brilliant artists and rich cultural developments, while France lives in infamy as the nation that destroyed the USA. Whatever path you choose to lead your nation down, you can rest assured in two things: One, it will be a long and hard battle, as it was for any nation during those times to ascend to greatness. Two, it will most certainly be worth it.\n\nA final caveat: The base game by itself is somewhat...flawed. Purchasing the DLCs "A House Divided" (which adds Civil War content, revamps the economic and political systems, adds casus belli fabrication, and more) and "Heart of Darkness" (which vastly improves the colonization system, adds international crises which can be resolved through negotiation or combat, and other things) will lead to a much, much more rewarding experience.","April 22","true","99.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Historical events and options are plentiful. A shorter timespan than most PI games, only 100 years, from 1836 to 1936, as opposed to the four centuries that Crusader Kings and Europa Universalis have. Starting just at the rise of Pax Britannica, just after the falls of the French and Spanish Empires, there's so much to do in this game. Form the German Empire. Try and stay an Absolute Monarchy through the rise of Liberalism, Socialism, Communism and Fascism. Act out America's Manifest Destiny and partake in the Civil War. Play the Chinese Empire and try and modernise and resist foreign influences. Play the Ottoman Empire and prevent your backslide into historical obscurity. There's so much to do, and you've got to make your own goals. In usual Paradox style there's a ton of super-complex systems that you need to know, but if you get a handle on it, there's so much depth and replayabilitiy to be done.","June 5, 2014","true","157.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And, furthermore, considering HOD is essential for at least slightly realistic battles and therefore more fair wars, HOD is a paid patch.\n\nThere is a big problem with feedback. One of your provinces is being sieged? Good luck finding out which one it is in your massive global empire. Oh, and that unit finished that siege eight months ago. Oh, suddenly we're losing money. Oops, forgot to upgrade that colonization effort to a protectorate and now somebody else has taken it.\n\nEven with HOD, the colonization mechanics are still rubbish at best. There is no real historical accuracy at all. Now, I know it's a game where you're supposed to create your own history, and that's fine, but why the ♥♥♥♥ is Russia colonizing Ethiopia?\n\nThe diplomacy system is S H I T E. It's simply awful. The diplomacy points system makes little to no sense for the era and the 'Very Unlikely/Unlikely/Maybe/Likely/Very Likely' system is terrible.\n\nBut the worst aspect of this game are your allies. They are pointless.\n\nPlaying as Portugal (which in EUIV is a fun, challenging nation to play and has an interesting history in the Victorian era), I sent an alliance offer to Britain. hey accepted with 'Likely'. The Netherlands almost immediately declares war on me and Britain ♥♥♥♥s off like a little ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nNot only would this NEVER HAPPEN in real life considering Britain and Portugal have been allies since the late 1300s, but also because they are both enemies of the Dutch in this time period.\n\nAnd guess what? Suddenly France, Spain, every man and his dog are at war with me. Not fair. I lost all my colonies in Africa and lost Douros to the bloody Spanish.\n\nThat sucks. The AI really hates you in this game. No joke. I think it genuinley hates the player.\n\nSomething I will praise is the economy system and the factory/industry mechanic, which are both unique and well done. War itself, if balanced, is actually pretty fun and managing the politcal system is rewarding and captivating.\n\nBut, this game is outdated and mostly broken. I would say you should wait until those Swedish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at Paradox release Victoria III, or buy EUIV if it's on sale.\n\nDespite it's flaws, Victoria II can be fun if played with both of the major DLCs and a lot of patience. Oh, and maybe some cheats because sometimes the game is so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I feel like I need to send it to a mental hospital.","March 9, 2015","false","67.5"," 28 of 59 people (47%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","47","28","59","4","1"

Why? Because there was a ctd straight after the installation finished, therefore making the game unplayable. A solution can be easily found, so you might wonder why this  would suffice to give a thumb down for an otherwise very good game.\nThe answer:\nThis ctd has been known for at least four years now and has still not been fixed by paradox. I should not have to fix some unavoidable ctd straight after purchasing a game and this has in fact been the only game (with 80 in the library) where I ever experienced something like this.

Vicky 2 is great when it comes to the economic build up and the complexities of Great Power diplomacy, but it falls (extremely) when military and basic AI comes into the fray.  Military is very messy and unorganized, something that I was surprised to see in a Pdox game.  I have heard players say it is micromanagement, but it isn't.  It comes down to very bad game design right down to the UI.  It is no wonder why the series hasn't had any rumors of a sequel since this was poorly executed.

Sure, there is tutorial, but it is still not enough for me.

Competing with other great powers for the rich coast of Africa is a fun contest of will and strength.\n-Taking a nation from "civilized" to "Great Power" is amazing-I took Japan and made it into a great power, easily overpowering Spain and the USA in the conquest of China.\n\nNegatives of the game in my eyes:\n-Horrible amount of popup events-I understand that you get random events, sometimes negative and sometimes positive, but when you get the same dang event popping up fifty-seven times in twenty minutes, it makes for a lousy impression. I've heard that its due to some of the DLCs, but that's still no excuse for this to occur so often.\n-Great powers gang up- You can be helping the smallest of nations with some small war, and suddenly you'll find yourself facing the UK and bloody every other great power on Earth for no other reason than the fact that you're at war. Others may find this realistic, I find it annoying, especially if I'm the one being attacked by the smaller nation.\n-Literacy rate makes or breaks you-I realize that I do not yet quite understand the full concept of literacy in Victoria 2, but I hate that you can have a full education budget and dedicate all of your resources to try and build up the literate people, but it will still take you decades (and often longer) to go up a few percentage points.\n-Unstable game-Pretty self explanitory. This game crashes every so often, though it the biggest complaint with this is that mods cause it to crash like a boss.\n\nAfter all is said and done, do I regret buying this game? No, I certainly do not. However, I do think that you should ask yourself if you like grand strategy games and if you are willing to look past the flaws. It can be a really fun experiance, but you'll have to not get annoyed at the crashes or the endless popup events.","July 14, 2015","false","68.9"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryryrecords/recommended/42960/","ryryrecords","ryryrecords","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryryrecords/","198 products in account","Do you feel like watching 4 hours of tutorials and reading guides for another 2?  If so, this game is for you!\n\nI normally wouldn't complain about investing the time to play a game... if the game actually paid off.  I found myself bored quickly bored.  There are several other games that have much better mechanics and keep game play interesting.  This is not Sid Meiers Civilization -- and in my opinion that would be the game to recommend.\n\nWhen I compare this to other strategy games, I see how the developers tried really hard, tried to add an original spin on things, and failed, failed, failed.  I suppose it's an honest effort compared to franchises that have bigger budgets to work with.  I really think this game could have been great if it were more intuitive, quicker paced with better action/events, and threw in some cut scenes and an expanded diplomatic section.\n\nThe basic plot is to play as any country in the Victorian era.  The game really centers around the big powers of the day -- Britain, Russia, Germany, and a few others including America.  The game seems built to cater to players who will automatically pick a big power.  If, however, you pick a smaller or less influential country -- game play is like eating dry toast.\n\nThere is a research system for "national focus" which lets you open up new technology and discoveries.  The options are well-thought out and historically appropriate.  The major flaw is the slow speed to finish one item of research.  I don't see how anyone can unlock and achieve all the national focus items even at the drawn-out slow pace of the game.  If we are being realistic, 2015 would not be 2015 as we know and live in it if it were based on the research portion.  So... fail.  Perhaps, there is another way, but with the hours of other things you have to learn, a dull tutorial, and lack of intuitivity, this just isn't happening.\n\nThe political decision tree is very interesting with well thought out social and political reforms.  One's in-game choices will alter the political leanings of your population.  The problem I have with the political system is that many of the options are unavailable with many countries.  I suppose this is somewhat.... somewhat... realistic, however, it often leaves the player frustrated when trying to progress.\n\nProduction is much the same as production in many other strategy games.  You import, export, and stockile resources.  You build factories if you are under a government system that can, or wealthy capitalists build them for you.  If you need a certain resource, you either buy it at market price or you go take over a country that has that resource.  Though, aggressive players might have advanced tactics for taking over the world, the game doesn't make hostile takeovers simple nor easy.  Also, it feels that if you produce goods and have spent your in-game time researching industrialization you are painting a bullseye on your back.  With the slow pace of research, you simply cannot have a strong military and a strong industry unless you are a super power.  This was how I lost Switzerland.... poor cuckoo clock makers.\n\nThe military aspect of the game, by default, somewhat follows what happened in history.  Depending on what country you are playing you'll either be severely handicapped or very powerful.  The military options are decent and much more straight-forward than other game mechanics.  When I say straight forward, I do not mean easy.  Some countries seem fated to certain takeover despite a well thought out strategy.\n\nThe diplomatic options were appealing to me.  The options included do expand the diplomatic choices a player can make.  This would be great if it weren't based on a points spent system that crawls far too slowly.\n\nThere are some unique aspects to the mechanics of the game such as population militancy and choices that advance or curtial liberlism.  I am sure if I had more time to let my eyes glaze over waiting for something to happen, they might be appreciable features.\n\nAll-in-all, if you are a big enough fan of this type of game, spend te extra to get Civilization or Europa or, my personal favourite Democracy 3.","October 18, 2015","false","10.9"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

I've read wikia pages and the 15 scene tutorial.  I understand the concept but that's about it.  Took me probably 30 hours to figure out how the combat system works, very detailed but without an easy to use interface or even a help file that explains the differences in rows and support %'s there's no way to know what's going on.  Only reason I understand it is that wikia cleared it up.  Great concept of a game, I think the game mechanics are probably great if I could ever figure them out.

This is not for everyone. The combat is basically a combination of luck and stats and is very frustrating so don't come into this game expecting anything like StarCraft.\n\nAs an avid lover of history though this is basically my wet dream come true. Victoria II focuses on the Post Napoleon Era of the world. This game allows you to play as basically everything country that existed between the early 19th century and the 1920s. I have never seen a game that allowed me to play as Belgium or Colombia or Hawaii. The point is to take your country from an early industrial state to being an imperial empire.\n\nYou have to build your nation, your economy, your foreign relations, and your military. Either hope to be one of the eight main superpowers or pray to at least maintain your independence. What it most interesting is that there doesn't seem to be a way to actually "lose". When my government was overthrown I thought I lost, but the game kept going. Except we were communists and new social policies were in place and my ecomony was wrecked from the civil war. Which is interesting mechanic. The objective is to be the top great power and you are competing with over a 100 other nations that may come and go. Mods add even more.\n\nVictoria II works for me because I like the management aspect and it focuses on my favorite era of history and allows me to play anywhere in the world. I have to plan my economy and expansion and go to war carefully since it can cost you prestige, cost you a portion of your workforce if they get slaughtered, and drain your economy (like a real nation).\n\nIt's not a perfect game, but I have fun and maybe you will too.","October 5, 2014","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only downside like most Paradox Interactive games is the learning curve.  You'll spend several and I mean serveral hours learning how to do everything, what every chart means (where every chart is), what all the stats mean etc.. but once you do, you'll be hooked.\n\nYou'll take control of any nation that existed in the world in the year of 1836 (or 1861 with some DLC) and shape their future until the start of the 2nd World War..... You'll do this with war, diplomacy and industrial power...\n\nStop Germany from ever getting formed... as the US why stop with just colonizing the west during the manifest destiny.. why not take all of mexico?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcus_salvius_otho/recommended/42960/","marcus_salvius_otho","Imperator Otho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/marcus_salvius_otho/","40 products in account","I think this is a good game and I recommend it. That being said, it has some extremely annoying features.\n\nFirst off, I hate late game combat. Good combat, in my opinion is when there are two great powers with more or less equal armies that attack each other. That combat I love, early and mid game combat is really fun and challenging. But once chemical warfare has been invented and level five forts are built, forget it. Do you want to take over a single region of a tiny country that has one brigade? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad. You know why? Because they built max level forts in every single one of there regions and also mobilized there forces so they have twenty billion brigades now. Oh, and not to mention they are allied with every single nation in the entire game. But thats just little countries. Not being able to take over other small civilized nations is fine, I can live with it, but combat is just not fun fighting anything at all. I mean, god damn its so pointlessly slow and painfully frustrating. For example, I was fighting against Italy as Germany. As Germany, I had conqured Austria, Bohemia and Morovia, as well as totally dismantled the Austrian Empire by freeing Hungary and Slovenia. So Austria was gone, and it was about 1930 in game. Italy had a much weaker army that I did, and they were fighting to defend Switzerland. They had tiny populations in comparison to mine. I sent my entire army, of over 300 brigades, against my enemies who had a few armies of about 14. I sent some boats around to blockade Italy, and in doing so, it was revealed that that was the extent of there armies. Alright, this will be over quick. Right? I send a eighty four brigades against the puny Swiss army of 14, while I waited in the border regions for Italy to make there move. It literally takes months of ingame fighting to actually beat the army, and in doing so I lost thousands of men, while the Swiss army came out relativly unscathed. Yes, yes indeed, the Swiss army takes almost no casulaties against a gigantic army of death. Oh, and did I mention they just spammed infantry while my entire army was composed of guards, artillery, tanks, and planes? I also had all military techs researched. In the meantime, Italy mobalized there forces and are now pulling huge stacks of 60 brigades out of there ♥♥♥♥. So, thats fine, I have armies of 14 brigades all along the border with level 5-6 forts. They send their armies to attack mine, and the only way I can possibly beat them is if I grossly outnumber them, and they are attacking me on fortified regions. Oh right, they were also spamming infantry. And all of my armies were composed of the most advanced possible units. Every single god damn battle takes so damn long, and EVERY SINGLE TIME I can't kill any of the enemy! Its so futile, everytime I manage to kill any brigade, two more take its place! So even with the largest and most advanced army in the entire world, I can't beat two ♥♥♥♥ tier nations spamming infantry. Meanwhile in Switzerland I keep beating them (because I outnumber them three two one) and I just can't.. kill them. I just can't. I literally CAN'T KILL ANY OF THEM. They just run off to there other region and regenerate there army in ten seconds and go back to one of the captured regions. It is immensly frustrating. And it doesn't help that every square inch of Switzerland and Northern Italy is covered with maxed out level forts. Not that I could go on the offensive at all. I couldn't beat there god damn infantry stacks on my own fort covered land, let alone theirs. It just feels like you never make any real progress, you know? Like your just stuck. So ♥♥♥♥ the combat in this game.\n\nThe other really annoying thing about this game is the diplomacy. The diplomacy system makes sense, but its still pretty obnoxious. If you are in dire need of allies, and are preparing for war (say, when I was playing as the North German Fed. and was preparing war against Austria) their are no allies to be found. No one wants to ally with you. Ever. Except the stupid Ottomans, who are totally useless. But when you are all bloated with income and military strength, having the most powerful army in the world and have taken over Austria, every nation is falling over themselves to get allied with me. Oh, NOW you want an alliance Russia, now that I am Germany? Yeah, well I didn't get here thanks to you.\n\nMy other qualm with this game is the popups. The popups in this game are notorious, and for good reason. Usually, they aren't too bad during peacetime. Just a little annoying. But god damn they ♥♥♥♥ me off when I am micromanaging armies in a heated war. Every single time with the popups. You want to send an army into New Mexico? Well, you see, you can't because, this old guy bought a tractor up in Bualsville. So you know, pretty sweet right? Okay. Just wanted you to know. ♥♥♥♥. No, I don't care that old man Johnson bought a tractor, no I don't care that there's liberal agitation in Inverness, and NO I don't care that the upperhouse was rearranged and the reactionaries lost .17 percent of seats. Even still, I can handle the popups. The only time when I really, just can't stand them is during the elections. I'm sorry, are there too many popups? Here have some more. And this one literally obscures the entire middle part of the map!\n\nMy finaly issue is rebellions. They happen all the time, repetedly and without end. Even when it says militancy is going down, ITS LIEING. It goes up no matter what! They might as well have just taken out the militancy meter and just had scripted rebellions every five minutes or so. It might just be because I never reform to allow voting (♥♥♥♥ing popups), but god its annoying. It makes the game almost unplayable. Luckily, its a very easy thing to fix with mods, so you can just do it yourself. But in vanilla, sheesh, they never end.\n\nAll this is outweighed by the good in the game. The best part about this game is.. well, being successful. Watching as your economy explodes, as a never ending stream of factories are built all over your nation and your population booms to meet the growing demand. Or seeing your entire border bristle with forts and the most advanced brigades. Or basking in the never ending flow of money. Or see as your nation grows bigger and stronger as it takes over more and more regions. As it evolves from humble begannings as a uncivilized nation to a superpower that dominates the world. Having a colonial empire that streches from Kenya to Arabia. Which.. well, thats not really that big. I usually don't go for colonies in this game. But man, you COULD have colonies that stretch from Cape Town to Singapore (like the real life British Empire). So like any game, it terrible when you are losing and is great when you win. All in all, I spend over fifty hours in this game, so I recommend it fully.","July 1, 2014","true","264.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

There were only a few things that I found annoying (which are corrected in newer Paradox games).\n\nI played this game as the US and spent a large portion of my time at speed 5. One of the greatest changes between Victoria II and EU4 or CK2 is the ability to hide messages. I don't care that a certain county now has a nitroglycerin or the Copperheads are planning something, there's no reason that a dictator/president would be given that sort of information. Definitely need to know when someone's declared war on me, but otherwise, I find a lot of the popups to be annoying.\n\nThe amount of rebellions was also extremely annoying. I know I'm playing the US and the CSA is formed, but I spent most of the Civil War fighting the Jacobite (and several other) rebels into submission. Although the Civil War began in ~1858 I didn't finally put the nail in the coffin until 1872.\n\nThe election part of the game was interesting as it allows the player to manipulate who is going to win the election with no downside fo them.\n\nI am certainly still a noob at this game and will probably put in another 20 or so hours to at least learn the game.\n\ntl;dr: I enjoyed this game and will carry on playing.

The sheer scale and scope of it will blow your mind if you haven't played a Paradox game before (actually it still will even if you have). But once you start to understand its systems and the time period, your mind will really be expanded. The politics system and the economics alone are more detailed, realistic and complex than anything outside of a high-level supercomputer simulation (and certainly more so then any other game I know of).\n\nIt is daunting to learn the complexity of this game, but fortunately you don't really need to master all the systems in order to be able to play fairly well (you can get-by without understanding everything). And the more you play the more you'll master it and, like I said, by the time you've done that you will literally be a smarter person. The game's mechanics are complex enough that you cannot really predict the outcome of things in the long run (like which countries will come to dominate), because it's all based on complex systems interactive with other complex systems to create the ultimate complexity. Which does a good job of simulating human history,\n\nThe vanilla game is good, but it gets much better with mods. Of which there are lots. There's tweak mods, overhaul mods, alternate history mods, etc. But the one I would recommend for both improved gameplay and improved realism is POP Demand Mod (it's probably the closest you'll get to actually directing history).\n\nThis is a game where you take a nation from the 19th century, very much into the 20th. You can industrialise as an advanced European colonial power, or start as a primitive country (like say China or Japan) and if you play right, you can race ahead and catch up and even overtake the Europeans. By the end of a game you're likely to be in a very interesting world, with Monarchies, Democracies, Fascist and Communist states fighting it out in world wars. You will never have the same end-game world in more than one playthrough, so you're creating alternate history as you go.\n\nIf you're into hardcore strategy and/or history, then you've got to experience this game.","February 22, 2015","true","53.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
