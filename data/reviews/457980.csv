Puzzles are difficult. The artwork is amazing, the scenery very well done. Great bang for the buck. Good story as well. Very good for an Indie game.","June 5","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a very frustrating platformer with a zombie theme. There is some good puzzle potential but at 80 minutes of play I uninstalled and wish I hadnt paid for this.\n\nIf you like frustration and doing the same thing over and over again then this is the game for you. Still a neat take on zombie games and for that I applaud it. Now off to uninstall and play something else.","June 5","false","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game got its standard platforming puzzles and even zombies too :) and i love zombies. I know a lot of people are tired of those.\nWhile sometimes the controls can be a bit unresponsive, atleast to me (blame the controls right?) Its still a very nice game.\nWorth picking this one up if you are into platformers.\n\nSome Gameplay of the first level\nhttps://youtu.be/B1SlMu2ph4I","June 3","true","1.0"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
