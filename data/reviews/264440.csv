The art style is unlike anything I have seen before and reminds me of the awesome Disney movies I watched when I was young.\n\nThis game is ALPHA..which makes a "review" quite difficult. With the market changing and more alphas/betas going up for sale, I feel that it is fair to write my opinion on whether or not this is a good purchase.\n\nWhile the game does not have much content currently, you can see the framework for something amazing being designed. Devs are actively working on the game and recently released an update.\n\nIf you want to support the indie scene and enjoy playing Alpha games during development, this is a must buy. I did an interview with the developer which is really informative to the work they do on this game","July 2, 2014","true","2.6"," 22 of 31 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","22","31","0","4"

It's not near a full game yet, but it has promise and it seems like the developers are actively working on the game","January 29, 2015","true","0.1"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful","39","7","18","0","1"

I'm still playing with version EX8 with the same old errors and bugs. while other games "still" automatically "blocking" me from playing it if there's a new update.\n\nafter re-read this update EX9 information :\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/games/264440/announcements/detail/175961814419682112\n\n"..Thank you again, Patriots, and see you in October for EX10! .."\n\nit's already november now. where's that EX10? or does it mean "October 2015"?\n\nUPDATE DEC, 28 2014\n\nfinally, this game name changed into blue in my library. it means, it required an update. ok fine, i'll update this. the code name change into EX10 AND, change it's title into\n\nPLAY WAREHOUSE PROTOTYPE\n\nsince the gamedev admitting that this game still a prototype. well, all my previous comments should be remove. but, for historical reason. i'll keep it here.\n\nfor a prototype game,i don't need to give any further comment about the game. well, a prototype should be full of bugs & errors. and i wanna play a game, not to test a game. i've pay for this. but they sell a prototype?!\n\ni'm uninstalling this game. if i'm not forget, maybe i'll see this page again some time in late 2015 to check their progress.","August 20, 2014","false","0.5"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","13","39","0","0"

First, I agreed, but after playing tutorial, it says "Victory!", then I waited and happened nothing. Then I quited from the game and entered again (this time I chose low settings). The I complete tutorial again, but the same error. I can't understand what is happened.\n- Poor graphics","July 27, 2014","false","0.7"," 13 of 47 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","13","47","0","0"

It hasn't updated in over a year.  That sucks, it had potential, but I can't recommend this to anyone.  This isn't worth $0.10 cents so how could I in good faith tell someone to spend $10.00?","April 17","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
