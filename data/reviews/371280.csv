I only ran into a few minor problems with the game itself. The biggest and most glaring issue is a problem with collision. It seems as though when you are supposed to drop to another level, you can get stuck and have no choice but to reset. Besides this, there isn't much holding this back besides the price tag for what you are getting. Maybe wait for a sale.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=457996067","June 9, 2015","true","0.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","1"

The game is based on rolling or tumbling shapes (ball, cube, brick, cylinder, ...) through a labyrinth. Where it gets tricky is when you need to color each square of ground, or have restrictions tumbling (low ceiling), or you have time restrictions (labyrinth being bombed, conveyor belt). Some of these levels are very good.\n\nThe problems is the time-limited levels that you need to redo at each failure, and because the author likes long introductions (the game starts with a voice mail from space), that means spending a lot of time on these attempts getting past the easy stuff to fail yet again at something that is only revealed when it is too late (maybe a wrong turn in the labyrinth or a problem coming up on the conveyor that is obscured by other parts of the level). On the other hand, the game never lets you get into a new mechanic you've learned by providing a few more levels like it; instead, it prefers to throw a different mechanic at you quickly. Add to that a general lack of polish (changing the resolution always sets it immediately, no way to set SFX and cheap BGM volume separately, mixed quality of art style, getting stuck tumbling down the stairs because the game is using a general physics engine for what is essentially constrained movement), and my feelings about this game are mixed.\n\nIf the timed puzzles were optional, and if there were more levels, or if the game was cheaper, I'd recommend it, because I really liked some of the challenges. But as it is, I expect many buyers are going to be disappointed.","February 6","false","0.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It has come to a stage at which it became unplayable.\n\nThe idea of the game is great, but, at least the way it is now, did not captivated me that much.","April 10","true","3.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
