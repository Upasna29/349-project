You can move between the two dimensions most of the time as long as there is nothing in the other dimension that is blocking your way.\n\nThis isn't a problem in itself, but the way the game is designed is very frustrating...\n\nIt's hard to explain, but say you are trying to get across a spike pit with moving platforms that dissapear, what if at the very end the last platform is missing causing you certain failure? Well this game wants you to quickly move between dimension or the other map where there is a platform in mid-jump right before certain death.\n\nIt's almost like taking a leap of faith with every obstacle, because there's no real way of knowing what is on the other dimension since sometimes if you switch dimensions you will just die, because there will be a obstacle you were unaware of like a spike trap below. So...basically, just to get through the level you will have to do a lot of intensional dying just to memorize where everything is in both dimensions, while simutaneously trying not to die and collect stuff for bonus rewards...\n\nIf there was another mechanic like seeing both maps at the same time without having to switch, it would have made the game a lot better in my opinion. Leaps of faith are not my strongpoint, and certainly not a welcoming feature in such a difficult platformer.\n\n\n(Another example which stumped me on the first level for a few minutes was when there was a cliff that was too high to jump on top of, so I switched dimensions and the cliff got even taller with the character that jumps a bit higher, so both dimensions were seemingly unpassible. The trick is in mid jump with the character that can jump higher you are supposed to switch dimensions to the shorter cliff....  this is the type of stuff that is filled throughout the game which makes it more of a puzzle solver)\n\n- Not to mention the bonus stages which are so increibly difficult that I'd only reccomend it to the most hardcore of platforming champions.\n\n(Edit: One additional side note that I do not like, is some of the background music is comprised of loops of bug sounds like flys / bees buzzing in your ear...very irritating if you have a headset)","August 17, 2014","false","1.4"," 104 of 128 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","104","128","2","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidcruelty/recommended/315920/","liquidcruelty","Clarence the Lovely Giraffe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidcruelty/","1190 products in account",""Stonerid is a challenging 2D platformer."\nThat is putting it lightly.  This game is tough as NAILS.  There's a tutorial level explaining your abilities and the game mechanics, but the first proper level will cause you to do a mental double-take.  Even in the first few levels (the only ones I've played so far), a level of precision is expected of you that isn't seen much in modern platform games.\nThe physics and handling are rather barebones, without the rich velocity control of games like Super Meat Boy, which essentially makes it less forgiving!  Thankfully one has seemingly infinite lives, starting from the beginning of the level or the last checkpoint stone you touched.  You will need them.\nThe dimension-shifting aspect can be a shot in the dark sometimes, as the game will not let you teleport into a wall but it WILL let you appear touching an enemy or just over spikes.  In a more typical modern game, this would either not be possible or there would be some sort of visual indicator of where you'll appear on the other side, but that's not to say this is an oversight by the developers, I think you're honestly just expected to keep track of your relative position or pay the consequences.\nI don't personally care much for the graphic and sound aesthetics, but your mileage may vary.\n\nAnyway tl;dr:  this would probably be a good pick for you platformer prodigies out there!   It isn't sadistically difficult to the degree of I Want To Be The Guy or Kaizo Mario, and it doesn't have the "♥♥♥♥ you" traps of those or Syobon Action (Cat Mario), but at the same time it is a little too hardcore to be considered a "normal" game, whatever that means to you.","August 15, 2014","true","1.2"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","32","45","0","0"

In one world, our intrepid rocky protagonist is a somewhat benign-looking statue with enough heft to destroy enemies by jumping on them with the full brunt of his weight. In the alternate, the statue takes on a more demonic look and is lighter, enabling longer jumps but negating the capacity for combat. World-switching is done on the fly, often needing to be done mid-jump to avoid obstacles or reach platforms that only exist in one of the two realities.While the idea behind the world-switching is interesting, Stonerid has the unfortunate malady of controls that are best described as ‘muddy’. Movement feels slow and the controls are not especially responsive.The real trouble I had with Stonerid probably boils down to a perfect storm of sorts. With the controls so muddled and movement made slow and swampy, the precision needed for proper jumps and world-switching hangs mostly out of reach. The gameplay became very frustrating, which is almost too bad since the concept is sound and the art is beautiful.For the cost, the art alone may be worth checking out, but I’d certainly not recommend this title to any but the staunchest of platforming fans who are looking to support more independent developers.","September 24, 2014","true","6.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","0"

This means you will have to learn the levels properly in order to complete them. This sounds fine in theory, but it’s hard to keep yourself going at times when you feel what you just did was in no way predictable.\n\nOther than this, the gameplay is fantastic and very enjoyable thus far. It’s certainly not for the light-hearted, as I am no platformer veteran, but no causal either and I died many times on even the first level on easy... I dare not think what hard-mode is like.\n\nThe art style is gorgeous and really brings the game alive, and no doubt fans of games such as Super Meat Boy and Giana Sisters will thoroughly enjoy. It’s well priced and offers a great amount of fun and replayability, just be wary of the slight clunkiness of the different dimension mechanic.","August 16, 2014","true","2.4"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","1"

The developers should know better than to make the player blindly jump from dimension to dimension. With games that have done the dual dimension mechanic correctly, like Guacamelee, there is absolutely no reason to ever try this game.\n\nBeyond that, the jump mechanic is very awkward and the animations are very bland. Even if it's on sale for half a buck, save yourself the hassle and stay away.

The game tells a story of an OLD tree, whose main task is to solve the mystery of the toxic waste, now appearing unexpectedly on Atronast Mountain. This isn't the best story line ever, but it does send a positive message. The story bassically tells the story of real life as of now: a planet constantly being polluted.

It's one of those games where you can switch into another world on the spot to add depth to the game.

Whenever you are changing dimensions you are able to reach other area's and surfaces. The "Dimension tree" as i call it. is faster, jump higher and is able to climb so ladders. The normal tree is slow and can't jump very high but is stronger to defeat enemies.. But you have to change dimensions from time to time. Not only for completing a level but also finding some collectables or other resources. Collecting all the resources will reward you in score points.\n\nYou are able to skip Cutscenes.\nMusic is calm.\nGraphics and scenery are fine.\nThere is Easy/Medium and hard mode.\nThere is a tutorial (Not required to do, but recommended).\nPressing the Start/Escape button, will show you the controls.\nThere are secret area's\n\nOther things.\nGame is pretty difficult and im not talking about the difficulty alone.\nAfter dying too much, you can't be arsed anymore about those collectables.
