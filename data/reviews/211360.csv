"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosebuster/recommended/211360/","rosebuster","Rosey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rosebuster/","1284 products in account","This game is brilliant. It has one main strength that makes it a true gem, but it might be often overlooked: this game has two faces really.\n\nAt first glance it seems like a very casual but pleasant puzzle platformer. The levels are fun, they require a little bit of figuring out but nothing too complicated. You can pretty much play through the main 100 levels of this game like that without even realising there's more to it. This makes the game appeal to those gamers who just enjoy to chill out.\n\nBut there's a lot more this game is hiding... As you'll find out if you try earning fancier flowers, which requires completing levels within a strict time limit. You'll soon realise that for many levels those basic obvious methods of solving them that you used so far don't really work if you want to be fast enough. You suddenly learn the game has a number of undocumented features... little tricks you can do that may even look like exploits, allowing you to skip parts of the levels... But no! You're actually supposed to do all that! Those tricks aren't easy to pull off and getting good enough times is really challenging. Suddenly the casual chill-out game becomes a test of skill comparable to Super Meat Boy. And if you manage to get through all that too and you think you're done... Nope! Super-hard bonus levels are unlocked. If you manage to 100% this game, you're really really good.\n\nThis all makes Offspring Fling a great little game for both casual gamers and the most hardcore players. I'm very positively surprised, because initially when I started playing it, it seemed very generic and not standing out in any way. I saw very simplistic graphics and simple puzzles like in million other flash games published on various websites. I was wrong. I was completely wrong. Please take my word for it and don't get the wrong impression like I did. This game is a true masterpiece.","February 13, 2014","true","91.2"," 64 of 73 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","64","73","0","5"

Lots of minor optimizations and hidden tricks that mean you can do a lot more than you initially thought, and do it much faster. It opens up every level to be re-analyzed again, this time looking for optimal strategies.\n\nI recommend this game regardless of which kind of game you prefer.","October 13, 2014","true","4.0"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","32","34","0","0"

You play as a mother Pikachu thing that needs to get her babies out the door and then get out herself. To do this, you can pick them up, throw them to the left or right, jump, hit switches and so on. You can even put them down on switches or on door blocks so when you hit the switch, the door holds open. When thrown, the babies go across the screen until they hit something then they fall. That lets them be used to hit triggers from far away. When carrying a baby, you can't jump as high, nor can you fit through small gaps as you normally can when not carrying them. If one baby doesn't make it, then you merely restart the level with the quick restart button.\n\nEven if the music and art style weren't top notch, this would be a great puzzle game. Most every level is only a single screen and you will blow through 40+ levels before you reach a real challenge. Not every level is meant to be a challenge though. Some are very simple to show new techniques and others are just fun in general. Each completed level unlocks others, but you can go in order and just keep playing the next level. It adds to the flow of the game. The levels are quick, simple, engaging and rewarding; all with a dose of adorability. Each level has a par time and keeps track of your best time. In fact the game shows you your ghost when you replay levels that you have completed.\n\nEventually, throwable rocks, adorable enemies, breakable blocks, crayon colored deadly traps and angled trampolines that change thrown baby directions get added to the mix. Throwing your babies into the adorable enemies is a way to stun them. Its a good way to keep amping up the challenge and diversity between level to level. Remember baby, mama loves you, no matter how much she throws you against the wall or into the face of a giant lizard.\n\nThis game goes by quick, and to pad it out, there is a level editor, along with the ability to download countless other levels made by other users. There's a lot of engaging fun here, but it all goes by so quick and virtually effortless that it feels like there's no reason to come back. 5 minutes of play can complete 10 levels.","October 15, 2013","true","2.4"," 32 of 43 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","32","43","0","0"

Playing this game casually results into a peaceful experience with a puzzle platformer with short levels and easy-to-get mechanics, including the basic as jumping, grabbing, throwing...\n\nBut playing this game in a serious way uncovers the true potential it has to offer. Offspring Fling is actually a game crafted for people who loves to speedrun, and challenge you not only to beat the levels, but also to do that in a certain time mark. Most of them are extremely tight and accurate, and involves doing very hidden skills that could even look like game flaws for some people, while they're actually crucial techiques in order to beat most levels in time. Even the most basic techniques require a huge amount of timing if you want to do all the tricks this game has; it's even comparable to executing long combos in fighting games, no joking.\n\nIf anyone of you check my game stats, you'll see that there's a lapse of TWO YEARS between some achievements. This proves how much time I've been denying this game 'cause it basically felt too strong to me back then. But after 2 years playing A LOT of platformers, I eventually felt ready for Offspring Fling, and even like that it's been a true challenge for me.\n\nAll in all, this game can be played by anybody no matter what's your purpose in games (either casual or hardcore gaming), and will successfully give you what you want. Nevertheless after taking the challenge I truly recommend playing this game for the time trial stuff since you'll be surprised about how deep and complex this title is.\n\nFinal Mark: My Blistered Thumb UP.","September 9, 2015","true","10.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

It hurts.\n\nAs a puzzle game, this is just sweet. But you'll try to beat the clock and then it becomes the opposite of sweet. Stop it, you'll hurt yourself.\n\nThe game is lovely. Graphics are pixelly and retro-ish, instead of jaw-droppingly shiny and sparkly, but don't judge this one by it's screenshots. The artwork and music/sfx are both fitting and kid-friendly in my opinion. Puzzles start easy enough and don't seem too hard to figure out. Then of course you try to do them in the shortest time possible which ups the difficulty considerably. Puzzles require some cranial commitment and dexterous digits but so far i wouldn't say either the puzzles or the platforming is too difficult.\n\nRecommended to fans of puzzle/platform games.

It's just the right level of difficult: It may take a few tries to beat a level, but I'm not ripping my hair out with frustration. I'm also willing to replay levels immediately after completing them in order to get a better score because I feel capable of achieving the goal times; they aren't unrealistic amounts.\n\nThe art style is simple and cute. It reminds me of pokemon and others bits of my childhood. When I'm not trying to cut down on my time, I like messing with the environment, mostly destroying dandelions. I feel like there should be an achievement for destroying x amount of dandelions. The first time I died, I laughed at the explosion animation; it was perfect. I also enjoy the sound effects.\n\nOverall, this a a perfect not-too-hard, not-too-easy game. I can keep track of time with the "shadow" of my previous play.

The secret is that this 100 is only ~30% completion -- unlocking levels 101-110 requires fast speed-runs of the first 100, and to unlock 111-120 you have to do them faster still.\n\nI'll play a hard platformer like Meat Boy and love it even as I curse it, but I have zero interest in grinding away to shave off time-attack seconds. It's boring and tedious, and it's a shame, because the later levels look a lot more fun than the early ones.\n\nCute art, though.","December 26, 2013","false","1.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

It's a speed run platformer clearly inspired buy Yoshi's Island and the SNES era. Beautiful graphics and a charming soundtrack. This game is mostly intended for hardcore speed run fans, as some of the par time requirements are outrageous and require flawless precision, which feels impossible when the buttons to pick up children and throw them are mapped to seperate keys that can't be combined. If pickup/throw was on the same key, my timing would be much better. You will restart levels frequently for par times - the devs knew this by making a key instantly restart the level. My problem is I feel like I'm constantly restarting (for par times) due to missed landings, imperfect jumps, and the damn config issue. I'm not sure if the problem is me, the game, or my controller. Otherwise, the game is rock solid, has a level editor, and still good as a platformer, but it isn't for me.","May 10, 2013","true","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A level can be done repeatedly to ensure you get a better score.\n\nPersonal opinion: I do enjoy platformers, and I have many games in this genre beaten - but for some reason the whole set of the game doesn't appeal me at all.

The real challenge here is getting the character to do what you want consistently.\n\nTypically, one might be expected to adapt to the controls over time, but since the player is tasked with performing actions within a very narrow window, every second you're left fighting them, is time lost in your attempt to achieve the goal. The result is a very frustrating experience.\n\nThe inclusion of a level editor is a welcome surprise since this leads to an unlimited amount of extra content (stages) you could potentially create for yourself, or share with others online.\n\nGraphics options are sparse, ranging from two preset windowed options to two preset fullscreen options. They serve their purpose but it's nothing fancy.\n\nBottomline: Unless you're proficient with just the keyboard itself, or prepared to configure a controller through third party software such as joytokey, I'd say pass on this for now (although there is potential for things to be fixed in the future).\n\nedit: Join the beta branch for a build of this game with better controls that actually make the game enjoyable (although proper menu navigation is still lacking, you're at least able to control character movement with the dpad).","August 18, 2014","false","7.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

A childlike sensibility embodies every aspect of the game, from the beautiful crayon aesthetic to the heartfelt premise of a mother that has somehow misplaced here extremely numerous children. The music also does a good job at setting it apart, mixing classic 8-Bit sounds with classical instruments to great effect.\n\nIt's a shame then that the gameplay doesn't reach the same level, and in fact I found it rather dull and inconsistently challenging. This is mainly because of the jumping mechanics, which feel very much inspired by Nintendo's Kirby games (your character's appearance shares a striking similarity to him as well). They are simply too floaty and impressive for a game built so heavily around timing, and made some of the otherwise basic levels frustrating to complete. The spotty controller support didn't help, as anyone that has tried to play a platformer using a keyboard should understand.\n\nIf you can get past the controls you'll find a lightweight, mostly enjoyable puzzle platformer that never quite reaches its full potential, and is best appreciated in bite sized sessions to combat its somewhat repetitive design. If you are looking for a more well rounded experience however, you will probably be better served elsewhere.","July 19, 2013","true","6.2"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","5"

No option to change resolution or set the game in full screen (I may be wrong). The game had stable performance at least, no crashes or bugs or glitches.\nGame play is simple, fling those offspring into doors, each level is pretty short and you don't have to play many of them to reach the ending, especially if you perform well. At most there are around 5 of those little guys (don't remember how big the largest level is) you have to throw around avoiding hazards. The graphics are cute, but are too derivative of something like Bubble Bobble and Kirby. The music is forgettable but appropriate for the game’s style.\nThe game just doesn't stand out, as competent as it is crafted. The best part is completing a stage under time, it’s like eating a burger, satisfactory, just enough to keep you going to the next stage. The core mechanics don't necessarily change, nor do you acquire powers that change dramatically the flow of the game, so it's you having to better your skills as you progress, a style of play I like.\nThe game would’ve been stronger if the levels somewhat longer, more distinct, and more dangerous, forcing the player’s attention more. Concentrating on beating times makes sense with the current design of the game fortunately, but I feel it may have limited the potential the game had.\nI find myself lukewarm towards the game, played it, completed it, forgot about it and that's the biggest sin a game can commit in my opinion.\n(Any mistakes in my text may be attributed to the fact that English is not my first language, sorry if it makes this review hard to read)","August 19, 2014","false","1.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's the simple premise!\n\nThe controls are very responsive and the jump button especially in regard to how hard you press that jump button.\nThe goal is simple:  Bring your offspring into the exit along with yourself. This sounds simple at first, but several entities are required to take into mind, and here's a few of them.\nMother Fling (That's what I'll call her now) gets a bigger "hitbox" the more offspring she carries(You can't pass through narrow spaces), she becomes slower and finally also jumps lower.\nFinally, you can 'fling' your offspring. This means tossing them straight ahead of you. This is what you'll be doing a lot, for most of the time you cannot simply carry your cute children to home sweet home.\n\nTime to mention the story as I get on to obstacles: Various creatures are out to harm your beloved small offspring. One in particular seemed to just scatter them all over the place, a big mean one.\nWhile it may not kill you, if a single off-spring is eaten alive or dies by the terrain such as drowning, you lose and must restart the level.\nI should mention that I like the animation on Mother Fling if her offspring dies, she holds her face like she's about to cry from seeing her children dying.\nMother Fling must also survive, remember that. Even if all of your offspring have been thrown into safety, if you die at that point, you're back to square one.\n\nThe music in the game is nice! It's good to hear game soundtracks that doesn't make you want to mute the game instantly.\nThe sound effects? Neato.\n\n\nIn conclusion; a cute puzzle game that's worth paying the cheap price.\nIf there's a sale on this game, it's basically a steal.","March 19, 2014","true","1.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This will sometimes mean throwing them to the exit or switched placed in the to be sucessful.\n\nI played through the Main 100 levels and did not wnat to bother with any of the gold or Dev times, and over all it says I have racked up, 56 minutes of level time and 2h 2 minutes of game time. The 56 is my fastest level times combined, and the 2h 2m ir my combine playing time (including dying). So it is short, but you can go for beating the levels in the fastest time and unlocking a further 20 levels.\n\nI can recommend it, but if you are unsure, there is a 15 level demo on the OffspringFling website.","April 4, 2014","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you complete the level faster than the time the developer set, you earn a juicy and illustrious Rainbow flower. However, almost ALL of the rainbow flowers are very difficult to earn. Patience, some key tricks you can perform which you will need to learn and master, and downright skill are needed to rack up all 110 Rainbow flowers.\n\nIf you are a fan of puzzle-platforming and have some keen quick reflexes, this is the perfect game!\n\nThe graphics and music are suitably charming, and service the game perfectly!","November 26, 2013","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes a lot of tries, but once I get that great time and that golden flower I feel extremely satisfied and proud. If you're a casual gamer but like a bit of a challenge, you should take a look at Offspring Fling.\n\nThe music was the first thing that took me, its beautifully simple and immersive. The only problem I had with it was the fact that it loops the same song and it can get repetitive. The plot of the game was introduced with pictures rather than words, which fits the game's style well. The controls are what make this timed platformer up, at first they feel unnatural and forced, but if you focus on where your character is at all times you start to adapt to them. The game's nature is simple yet competitive, you try to score a better time than a replay of yourself, that's it. The graphics are a unique simplistic 2D that also fits this game's theme perfectly, however it would help to make this platformer's graphics sharper from a gameplay perspective. The gameplay is fun for a while, but being that the game sticks with the same concepts for long periods of time make it tedious replaying the same thing over and over striving for the best score.\n\nOffspring fling does very well at what it's shooting for, however if the devs would have introduced more game mechanics at a quicker rate, the game would be much better. The controls could be smoothed, and some new music would be well deserved. My overall score of this game is a 6.5/10, slightly above average.","October 12, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also has pretty relaxing and nice music tracks, but would greatly benefit from a bit more variety  in conjunction with fewer repeated uses. The controls are decent, but it can start to hurt if you play for long amounts of time due to the layout on keyboard and some gamepads have issues, so smaller chunks of gameplay are recommended.\n\nThis game will be fricking intense (nearly frame perfect accuracy, rethinking of conventional mechanics, and lots of split second failures) if you want to see the unlockable levels and earn higher ranks.  If you're looking for a difficult platformer  mixed with some puzzling, look no further.  On the other hand, the gap between the time-based ranks is sizable and may not be worth the required mastery and time, but the regular difficulty is still  enjoyable.\n\nPeople who will truly love Offspring Fling: speedrunners and difficult game enthusiasts.

It also has pretty relaxing and nice music tracks, but would greatly benefit from a bit more variety  in conjunction with fewer repeated uses. The controls are decent, but it can start to hurt if you play for long amounts of time due to the layout on keyboard and some gamepads have issues, so smaller chunks of gameplay are recommended.\n\nThis game will be fricking intense (nearly frame perfect accuracy, rethinking of conventional mechanics, and lots of split second failures) if you want to see the unlockable levels and earn higher ranks.  If you're looking for a difficult platformer  mixed with some puzzling, look no further.  On the other hand, the gap between the time-based ranks is sizable and may not be worth the required mastery and time, but the regular difficulty is still  enjoyable.\n\nPeople who will truly love Offspring Fling: speedrunners and difficult game enthusiasts.   People who will probably like it quite a bit: puzzle fans, average players,  and fans of games done with retro sensibilities.

It also has pretty relaxing and nice music tracks, but would greatly benefit from a bit more variety  in conjunction with fewer repeated uses. The controls are decent, but it can start to hurt if you play for long amounts of time due to the layout on keyboard and some gamepads have issues, so smaller chunks of gameplay are recommended.\n\nThis game will be fricking intense (nearly frame perfect accuracy, rethinking of conventional mechanics, and lots of split second failures) if you want to see the unlockable levels and earn higher ranks.  If you're looking for a difficult platformer  mixed with some puzzling, look no further.  On the other hand, the gap between the time-based ranks is sizable and may not be worth the required mastery and time, but the regular difficulty is still  enjoyable.\n\nPeople who will truly love Offspring Fling: speedrunners and difficult game enthusiasts.   People who will probably like it quite a bit: puzzle fans, average players,  and fans of games done with retro sensibilities.

If you complete the level faster than the time the developer set, you earn a juicy and illustrious Rainbow flower. However, almost ALL of the rainbow flowers are very difficult to earn. Patience, some key tricks you can perform which you will need to learn and master, and downright skill are needed to rack up all 110 Rainbow flowers.\n\nIf you are a fan of puzzle-platforming and have some keen quick reflexes, this is the perfect game!\n\nThe graphics and music are suitably charming, and service the game perfectly!","November 26, 2013","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was atrocious. Worse then Skyrim at maximum settings, for example. Here, I could let go of a movement key, and still go left for 2 seconds. I could jump, and the game would ignore it. I've only had 1 other game run this terribly, and the original Binding of Isaac, which was also coded in Flash, ran better for me. Further, some of the problems this game has had have been brought to the forums, and the dev has simply left them with "I've never seen it happen before."\n\nWhen it comes to some of the awkward jumps you need to make, or very time-sensitive moments, this hurts the gameplay greatly. A game like this needs to control well. And honestly, I hadn't even noticed any of the problems until I got further on --- because the problems were small enough not to notice when the game was easy. But it came to expect too much of you with broken controls. The game also has a very tiny community, and most of the time to be spent in the game is attempting to compete with the developer's best time, which utilizes tricks never taught to the player to cut time off of runs.\n\nBut if you're looking for the positive side?

It hides its insane difficulty until the end when you unlock the extra levels. I am not even going to try to beat those because they are Super Meat Boy levels of pixel-perfect precision and timing.","December 31, 2015","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

We seem to get a lot of those lately.\n\nI haven't played a whole lot of this (80 mins) because there really... isn't much there.  Its cute, I suppose.  The puzzle are sometimes a little tricky but it's nothing really snagging like a Portal and its aesthetic is not enough to keep me like a Critter Crunch or a Clikr.  There's no alternate play modes, so you kind of just get what you see.\n\nCan't really reccomend much, so don't get it unless a standard puzzle platformer with a better-than-generic aesthetic is what you want.","January 27, 2013","false","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TjM/recommended/211360/","TjM","╭Soli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TjM/","185 products in account","This is a solid platformer.There's nothing much to say more than that, really. Offspring Fling is about clearing relatively small levels, with numerous puzzles within each one, as fast as you can -- while using your "young" as objects to be carried to the exist, and to fling them across the level to operate levers and trigger-weights. The speed and movement is solid, the controls are responsive for the most part, and the game isn't as linear in solving the levels as one might think. It suprisingly has a bit of depth to it.\n\nNow, the depth of the game first shows itself with the dev's 'ghost', the recording of how the dev beat the level so quickly, in basically that... It cheats. It uses exploits in the game, to clear the game faster, like jumping constantly within a corridor with a short ceiling, to cut the animation short which boost's one speed a bit. And that's not the only exploit there is, although I haven't found any more than 2.\nThe game becomes more interesting that way, it builds a form of 'special techniques' that allows you to play in a specialized manner. And unlike, say, Dustforce, it's pretty easy to learn how to use them.\n\nI like this game, it's concise and simple, yet with enough depth to make you play the entire game more than once.","May 26","true","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
