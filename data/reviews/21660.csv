At this point it might be better to purchase Super Street Fighter IV as it offers a bigger rooster. Also, Ultra Street Fighter IV is scheduled to be released this year around the summertime.\n\nThere are not many old-school fighter games on PC these days. You have the remade Mortal Kombat, too, so there isn't really anything else out there for us PC gamers. Just make sure you have a controller as with the keyboard it is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ to play the game.\n\nInterestingly, the story takes place right after Street Fighter II ended. Chronologically, the game can be put between the 2nd and 3rd episode. Bison's Shadaloo organisation still exists and organises another tournament to gather the best fighters in the world - this time, however, instead of Bison you have Seth as the final boss. Seth combines the best moves of all the players out there - he has a lot of counter special attacks, very agile and overall a pain on harder difficulty settings.\n\nGradually, you can learn to fight with each SF character and can continue to play online. You need a lot of time and effort to master these fighters. You can unlock many more as you progress through the game.\n\nOverall, this is a really good game. When I was young my parents bought me Street Fighter II for the Super NES so for me this game was instantly captivating.","March 23, 2014","true","41.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Although it's only the vanilla version and you'll be better off with the Arcade one or just waiting for the Ultra Street Fighter 4 that's coming out next year, it's still a gem of fighting games.

Instead of offering an upgrade path, Capcom keeps people buying the same game with the new revisions. I picked up Super on PS3 awhile back and literally found it to be not much more than a glorified DLC package. Lesson learned. Never buy another Street Fighter till after Capcom has released version Super Ultra Mega etc etc and is definitely not going to release another.","July 16, 2015","false","10.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

While a bit more glitchy than its console counterpart, the formula that makes the combat so dynamic and exciting is still present in full form. While it takes a while to learn the ropes, progress in this game is particularily rewarding due to the 'in your face' nature of the combat. There's nothing like pulling off an ultra at the right time and obliterating half your opponents life bar. Best fighting game on the block.","August 5, 2011","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
