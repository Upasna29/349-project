"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nathria/recommended/381990/","nathria","Nathria","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nathria/","153 products in account","Let me start this from scratch.\n\nI've played Dragonica on gpotato back in time several years ago. I loved how unique the game was, and after the servers closed I didn't instantly forget about it, because it's one of the best MMO's I've ever played. I knew about its resurrection under the name of Dragon Saga, but it didn't really get me to play, until two days ago my cousin told me it's on steam. I instantly went on and installed it, because of previously stated reasons, and easy accessibility through steam. I thought it would be cool to play again. Boy, how wrong was I.\n\nLet me make one thing clear; the game is still fantastic, and I still consider it one of the best MMO's ever. However, the current team that's working on it, is worse than having sex with a nuclear bomb. Its having literally every kind of issue an online game can have. It's VERY poorly optimized, localization is terrible (random japanese speaking NPC's, weirdly translated texts, unclear quest objects, and so on, the list is huge), servers are unstable (I still wasn't able to find out where they are located), you are lucky if you're even able to login. But even if you log in, you just cringe over the fact that it's buggy as hell, parts of maps randomly disappear, you lose your hp for no reason (please don't explain this again, I know why it's happening), and all that kind of stuff, that makes it a very unpleasant experience.\n\nIn conclusion, the game itself is pretty cool, and normally I'd recommend it to everyone, but in its current state it's literally unplayable. The team behind it should really do something about this mess, because now they only make themself look like some random group of people who know nothing about games in particular.\n\nEDIT (please read this before you start complaining): Due to the high amount of views on my review, and to some of the nicer people clarifying some things to me, I've decided to edit my review. I'm NOT going to change it to recommended, because I still wouldn't recommend it to any player who wants a new MMO. But, I would totally recommend it to people, who've played Dragonica/Dragon Saga before, since it's KINDA the same thing, so you're most likely going to like it. My previously stated points still hold though, but as I've said in one of the comments here (which I advise you to read, or at least some of the decent ones) I have high hopes for this game to become succesful on steam, because it's insanely fun and I really hope the devs can make it a great experience to anyone. And most importantly, I hope that one day, I can recommend this game.","January 6","false","53.1"," 175 of 232 people (75%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","75","175","232","36","39"

This was the mmo that I played for the longest time; it's incredibly fun (although frustrating sometimes), but the community always kept me playing. I feel like I've made some life long friends in this game.\nThe game went through a lot of changes; this server is the least pay-to-win-like, so far I didn't spend a cent on the game and levelled/geared up perfectly fine, which is a huge plus compared to the old EU server.\nThe combat system is fun too; the dungeons and grinding can become repetitive and boring though, especially after around lvl 40-50, when the only way to level up fast is to grind tactic mode.\nThere are events in the game regulalry, so there is usually always something to do besides the usual gold farming when you're already higher level.\n\nTo sum up the game:\nPros:\n+ fun combat system\n+ relatively fast levelling\n+ not cash-shop heavy/pay2win\n+ regular ingame events\n+ awesome community\n+ mods/staff are active on forums\n\nCons:\n- grinding/questing can become repetitive\n- many bugs\n- translation errors/typos\n- duping is still a thing\n- occasional lags or crash-to-desktop (although I didn't have this for a long time now)\n- can't log in to an already existing account through the Steam version (this is probably because of the achievements)\n\nOverall, it is worth to try. It's not the best mmorpg out there, but there is definitely something about the game that makes people play it for such a long time.\n\nEdit: grammar","December 23, 2015","true","3.5"," 41 of 52 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","41","52","2","0"

There are also various available PvP modes, so it's kinda diversified.\nThe same fact applies to the PvE contents in this game, there are many dungeons and with some practice and equipment it's even able to clear them alone but there's always the possibility to create a party for more fun or faster runs, also the search system for partys is neatly arranged so you can always find a party easily. Additionally, the mission maps are always good alternative to farm if you're rather a "grinder".\nAt the same time there are plenty quests you can complete beside leveling or farming and in general there are so many things you can do in this game even if you don't expect it at the first sight.\n\nAt this point I also want to emphasize the work, which has been done by WarpPortal. They rescued a great game and in the recent past there were so many great changes made to improve the gameplay, help the community or simply fix bugs. The support is also a good address if you need some help, since I only had good experiences with it.\nIt's very impressive how much work has been done in the past year and with how much enthusiasm the team is working on this game. The amount of players also increased continuously while I play here and that's the result of the great work of WarpPortal and the fact that this is simply a great game.\n\nFinally, I gotta say, that the community on this server is great compared to many other games I played, also the forums are good for information, help requests, guides and many other things.\n\nMaybe we see each other ingame and sorry for my bad english, I am not a native speaker!\n- Xydor / Guild: RevenGER (<- new active german players always appreciated in our guild, you can find us in the T-Board ^-^)","December 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","31","36","7","0"

Where do I begin? This game brings back so much nostalgia that it means more to me than my education. I played this game back when it was called "Dragonica" and the basic feel is still there. Same simple, yet difficult to master gameplay, Same classes, with even more to add to the mix, and same community. The players in this game are awesome.\n\nGameplay: 9.5/10\n\nYou'll encounter a few glitches here and there, but the gameplay throughout is fun, consistent, and active. Early in the game you get a feel for fighting in the arcade-style scenarios, and you'll be using that knowledge you gain to expand your skills as you level. There's a ton of variety in the classes and skills that allows seasoned players to seamlessly switch between punishing monsters with powerful ground combos, and tossing the mobs like ragdolls to deal even more damage in the air! While some of the bosses can get a bit repetitive, you'll love wailing on them and watching your reward explode out of them!\nI've never been a fan of party play, personally, but you'll want to team up with other players to tackle the bigger dungeons. If you don't like the group aspect of gaming, never fear, as a skilled player can handle most of the content on their own, if they have the funds to build a perfect character.\n\nStory: 7.5/10 - SPOILERS in this section!\n\nThere are TONS of quests in Dragon Saga. Tons of little storylines for many npcs, as well as the main story. You're a decendant of one of the five legendary hero on an adventure to join the Dragon Fellowship and seal away the Dark Dragon Elga, who was released by the Black Witch Paris, a legendary hero who has gone rogue. Your adventure brings you through Paris' path of destruction on her way to the Tower of Drakos, Elga's prison. You battle her, and defeat her (if her damage reflect skill doesn't one hit you first!) with her final breath (is she dead? hmmm.) she is able to release the Dark dragon, who roosts at the top of your final destination. The Black Claw Nest. Seal him away before he can lay waste to the entire world. Not to mention there's loot in it for you.\nBesides the main story, there are a lot of little sidequests to do. I personally don't find them all that interesting, but there is tons of funny dialogue.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\n\nThe colorful, rich graphics make wailing on foes and other players a ton of fun! Some of the skill animations are hilarious, and make me smile every time I see them. One class actually summons an early boss in his underwear to freeze your opponents, while another spawns a huge wrestler spinning towards your foes! My personal favorite character designs are those of the Shaman class. Their summons/familiars are very well designed, and look intimidating. That huge Dark Knight strikes fear into the hearts of pvp players!\nThe world is beautiful, which each area of the continent of winds, and the continent of chaos having their own unique look. You travel from a nice meadow, that slowly transitions to a volcanic area in the early-mid game, which gives you a feeling of "growing up" in your fist playthrough, as you watch as your charater makes their way from such a welcoming place, to a treacherous area. While there are a lot of reskinned enemies in later areas, it's forgivable, as many games do it. The visuals are great.\n\nSupport: 10/10\n\nThe Support team for Dragon Saga is wonderful. They're always willing to help in any way they can. Their polite, knowledgeable staff show that they care for the players. I've had issues taken care of  very quickly, and with the sheer number of tickets I've sent about different things ranging from bugs, to unruly players to suggestions are always handled with professionalism. Trust me, you may not see them, but the staff are lurking in-game, and they're watching out for rulebeakers.\n\nCommunity: 7/10\n\nThis really can't be helped by the developers, but the community is a little small, and naturally, small interpersonal issues between players can escalate rather quickly. This  is apparent with the pvpers of the game, with players occasionally shaming each other in the trade chat channel, using foul language, and personal insults. On the other hand, a friend in Dragon Saga is a great friend. Begging  for items and gold is surprisingly uncommon, which is wonderful. I've met some awesome people here, and I've opened a facebook group for the community, where I've met some interesting people.\n\nF2P vs P2W: 8.5/10\n\nI've never been afraid to invest in a game that I enjoy. As an experienced gamer, I have to say that I'm impressed with Dragon Saga's cash shop. The items are reasonably priced, and dare I say, you can build a nice character without spending a cent. Be prepared to farm your butt off if you want to keep your wallet full, but the option is certainly there. The general agreement on the forum is that Dragon Saga is "pay to go faster" as opposed to "pay to win." Most of the premium items can be obtained without spending money. Insurance scrolls to prevent your items from breaking during the upgrade process can be bought for gold in the market, or exchanged for Silver coins which are an uncommon drop from monsters. There is no shortage of events in which you can earn premium items, as well!\n\nOverall: 8.5/10, yes, I'm biased.\n\nThis game holds a very special place in my heart. It kept me sane throughout university, and continues to provide me with tons of entertainment and friends to hang out with. I highly recommend checking it out, despite it's many bugs and flaws. I have nearly 3000 hours of LOGGED IN time on my main character, and another 1000 or so spread throughout my alts, none of which I regret. except that one time where I overpayed for something in the market! :P\nDragon Saga is my favorite F2P MMO, and certainly worth checking out for it's unique gameplay and community.","December 26, 2015","true","0.2"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","0"

The only downsides I can see to this game is that it can be laggy sometimes and even glitchy from now and then. You can even glitch into walls on some places. But in my opinion that just makes this game more fun and enjoyable cause there is like always something to do in it. So grab a friend or two and just relax and enjoy this masterpiece of a game that Warpportal has created. The community is also really good, yes there can be trolls here and there and overall toxic people, but so far I've mostly seen the really good side of the community. People that create Facebook groups and unite the players with a guild or such. This takes the game to a whole new level of fun and it's a level I'd happly enjoy until my last day on earth.

There are no bugs that can't be dealt with.\nThe support is helpful and friendly even though it is a bit slow at the moment which I guess can be explained with the higher amount of players after starting with the game here at steam.\nThe number of players online is growing everyday and after all the closings of Dragonica in 2014 it's great to see that this game is still there for all the ones who already loved playing this game on the servers in their location until they closed.\nAlso the WarpPortal developers try to do their best to make this game less P2W than it ever was for the other servers (EU, SEA, IAH, etc.) and I think they're doing a great job. Also there are many bug and exploit fixes lately and I just hope that they keep up their good work on this. You can reach everything without spending a single cent, okay it's a long way, but it's doable. Also spending even a small about in real cash ensures that this game will stay alive. But for all who don't want or can't spend a bit it is still a great game.\nStarting the game over steam has still some problems, but one should also keep in mind that it's still "fresh". I think the devs from Warpportal will manage to make this run smooth soon.\n\nAll in all the game has more facets than you can see on the first sight. So give it a try!","January 11","true","0.1"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

You basically use the Arrow Keys to move around and the ZX keys to do basic attacks and C to jump. Spells are assigned to ASDF and QWER. 1234 are empty but you can assign them items. You can consider this game to be similar to 2.5D Maplestory, where the Up and Down keys allows you to move in and out of the foreground and background. It's not an A+ game but it's playable.\n\nPROS\n1. Jumping\nThey have a fast way of moving in the game called a Dash Jump ->, ->, C. I like this a lot.\n\n2. Simple Actions\nLevel up your damage and spam XXXXXXXXXXXXX. That's how I killed the first boss, Vega, on Hard mode.\n\nCONS\n1. Tutorial\nIt doesn't cover quests properly and how to get complete certain quests. Assigning new spells to hotkeys are not mentioned and you have to figure them out yourself.\n\n2. Uninteresting Storyline\nOk. So, the world was created by someone and Humans were given the Earth, while the Dragons were given the Sky. Dragons got greedy and attacked the Humans. Humans retaliated with the power of the 5 Elements and won. 1000 years later, evil dragon awakens, starts a war, loses and gets imprisoned. Current storyline, evil dragon breaks free and is wreaking havoc. You are 1 of the 5 heroes tasked to slay the dragon.\n\nThat is not very interesting.\n\n3. Simple Classes\nWarrior, Mage, Archer and Thief. Standard archetypes. You can find this standard mockup anywhere.\n\n4. Too Much Information on 1 Screen\nAfter the tutorial, I began in the city. Too many spammers and ♥♥♥♥. I had to guess where to pickup my first quest from the minimap.","January 13","true","0.1"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","13","20","2","19"

The game runs smoothly on about any computer out there. The game starts by default on windowed 1024 x 768, but you have the option to change it to 1920 x 1080 in Option Settings. The amount of side quests and storyline quests is insane, it makes the game really fun to play with friends, well even solo is fun as long as you find a good guild to hang out with. The game play is all based on keyboard so if you like using a controller to play, you will have no trouble doing so.\n\nBugs (URGENT FIX NEEDED):\n-When using fullscreen, cutscenes seem to not be displayed on screen. The cutscenes from the game can only be viewed on windowed mode.\n-After using alt-tab multiple times while using fullscreen, when trying to get back into the game, the game won't appear and there will be a black/white rectangle on the top left part of the screen, showing only the desktop on the rest of the screen (Hard to explain).\n\nSmall bugs on Steam release:\n-When verifying steam login, it gets stuck on it for over 5 minutes sometimes, and it gets pretty annoying.\n-When selecting a resolution and fullscreen mode right off the bat after starting the game for first time, it crashed for me (Steam only).\n\nSuggestions:\n+Make the game start on fullscreen and the native resolution of the monitor being used.\n+(Not sure if this is a thing or not) Allow people to trade costumes and stuff through Steam Trading.\n+(Not sure if this is a thing or not) Allow people to use Steam Wallet for in-game cash items (Perhaps change currency in-game?).\n+The addition of Fullscreen Windowed mode would be amazing, that way people can alt-tab out of the game quickly.\n\nExperience:\n=Played this game since it was released in 2009 by IAHGames on the SEA server and also played this exact same server in the past before I quit.\n\nRating:\n+9/10 Fun times guaranteed.","December 23, 2015","true","164.7"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

It's a lot like MapleStory, but if it were in the stile of a 2.5D beat-em-up.  While I like the concept of this game, I honestly don't see myself coming back to it that often.  The whole time I was playing I was thinking. "I'd rather be playing MapleStory than this".  Don't get me wrong, this was a well-made game, but it also has a lot of flaws.  For instance, you could only have so many quests active at once, where in Maple you could have as many as you wanted and do them as you see fit.  The combat system seem to amass to nothing more than mash the attack button until you win, and your level doesn't seem to really mean much.  I also can't figure out how to distribute skill points.\n\nSee, Maple did this better.  I'd only recommend this one if you're a dedicated Role-Player and you like this sort of thing.","March 6","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I have played this game on the EU servers, IAH servers, Sea Servers and the good old THQ ice ones.\nAll of this sums up to about 6 years of gaming and about 40 different chars.\n\nThis might be just one more chibi style mmorpg some are saying. Let me tell you out of all the ones out there it is THE chibi style mmorpg.\n\nThis game comes with a really fun and fast combat system, amazing graphics and even the skill animations are just breath taking. We do have 3 sorts of pets, mounts, battle pets and just normal follow around ones (Yes even Dragons as pets - I know many like those).\n\nThe game comes with crafting system that is actually useful - the items you can craft do come without any real cash spending and believe it are not - are wanted, useful and do have a purpose.\n\nDragonSaga has a cute little housing system  called MyHome. You can put in furniture that does give you buffs to help you on your way. So you see, this is not only for the looks, but comes with a real purpose.\n\nThe game comes with field maps, mission maps and real dungeons. There is always something to do, whatever you prefer to do the day you are playing. The mission map rewards and the dungeon ones are actually pretty good and helpful. Every single mission map and even the dungeons can be entered without spending a cent of real cash.\n\nThis said, DragonSaga is the most free to play game I ever came across ouf of all the other so called "free to play" - but actually "pay to win" games. You are able to reach endgame and completely gear up a character without spending one cent of real money. Sure, you have to farm to reach this - but it is worth it.\n\nThe game currently is in a taking over process, which means Warpportal is getting the development rights for the game. So all new content and stuff will be directly developed by Warpportal.\nThis said, I want to sum up the updates and fixes we got the past few months (source are the server maint threads public visible in the game forum):\n\n- Removal of the annoying "Congratulations Bar"\n- new 50+ and 60+ HP and MP potions\n- Galaxa fixes (Hades Dungeon, Cancer Dungeon, Hydra Dungeon, Scorpio Dungeon and Ophiochus)\n- Several quest adjustments\n- Many quest text and ingame text fixes\n- Repair hammers freely available for ingame currency\n- 2 completely reworked events, including missionmaps and questchains\n- 1 completely new event mission map\n- Completely new PVE way for completing the 3rd class promiton - including storyline\n- Recolored and new assembled IM costumes\n- Recolored and new assembled event costumes - fully ingame achieveable\n- Recolored car mounts and event car mounts\n- Recolored event mount\n- Added costumes based on user contribution from a mix and match contest (including advanced, special and artifact ones)\n- fix for locking the whole party in F5 mission map after the boss dies, which prevented people from getting the loot\n- fix for locking the whole party if someone sees a quest cutscene\n- fix for locking the whole party in Drakos and Van Cliff Dungeon after the death of each mini boss\n- fixed a bug  a mission map boss had that enabled him to constantly spawn a shield around him\n- they added the possibility of same gender couples AND marriage\n- they added the possibility to re-create the POS set wings and weapon\n- slight PVP adjustments (more to follow according to the forums)\n- added new hair colors and faces for the humans and the dragokins\n- fixed the problem of the dungeon boss ryvious which made it possible that the monsters were still attacking you while the boss was already dead\n- added resting ep up to char level 85\n- added an all bonus exp free channel - channel 4\n- small security fixes\n- added new shop and new quest NPC's\n- fixed the battlesquare starting time bug - and even more times got added\n- added 1 slot inventory expansions for the Item Mall (Cash Shop)\n- Final Decision fix ( it works like before, no only one time hit anymore)\n- Spear jab and crosscut cooldowns have been seperated again\n- Stumble bum has been balanced based on community wish\n- added a "happy jobchange quest" for everyone promoting the first jobchange. This comes with tons of free stuff including a completely free inventory row for each inventory type\n\n\nI recommend this game to everyone out there to at least to try it out. I personally give this game a 9/10.\nBecause it still needs some adjustmenst and fixes. But I know these are coming.\n\nI can assure you in each server maint that comes up is at least one fix/adjustment included - and if it are only text fixes. I strongly believe with the taking over process finished the bug fixes and overall game updates will even get better as they are already now.\n\n9/10 for me and I hope to see you in the game!","December 27, 2015","true","1.0"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

It's sort of like a 3D Maplestory but even worse with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bugs and glitches.\nFirst of all, if you're an achievement ♥♥♥♥♥ and you're sizing up this game, lickin your cheeto stained dry lips, KNOW THIS:\nThis game has horrible sync with Steam and there's a LARGE chance you will not get certain achievements after completion.\nExample: There's an achievement for completing 10 "hero quests" I have done so. I have unlocked the INGAME achievement medal for doing so. But the STEAM achievement is stuck at 3/10.\nThe only theory I have to get around this is to continue completing quests and making new characters doing them all over again hoping the quests count/stack.\n\nNow let's say you don't care about achievements and just want to play the game. It's an okay game but it's buggy as hell and I don't see it being fixed any time soon. This company looks like it only cares about your cash.\nAnd the community isn't exactly great either. No one talks to eachother they only steal eachothers' mobs, bots selling gold everywhere. pretty much your average community of a dying game. depressing.\n\nIf you want to try it, go ahead.

First off, the game starts in Windowed mode, w/ no quick way to turn it to full screen. Then, after stumbling my way to the character screen (still in window mode, mind you), there were character slots plainly visible, but if I clicked them (as my intent in doing so was to make a character), nothing happened. There was no interface. Zero. None. Quick search helped me find out that there is a UI, but it is really thin down at the bottom of the screen (and b/c it is in Windowed mode, that UI is off the screen). It was difficult pulling up the settings tab as my Windows taskbar kept popping up. FINALLY got it into Fullscreen and selected make a character. Not a lot of character customization to talk about. But I pushed passed that and begined playing. Opening movie didn't play. Just a black screen and voice acting. Had to skip that :-/ Then once I was in the game, an NPC passed me and started talking to me while they were WAAY off screen. So when they were done talking, I pressed ESC to pull up settings and adjust the resolution settings - BUT I realized my mouse was disabled! That's a problem, but I haven't even moved my character one step, so I grudgingly pushed passed that and realized that the controls were clunky. Jump wasn't even spacebar? :-/\n\nDecided this game started off with a lot of bad, that it probably wasn't going to get any better.

I loved this game at first, but it quickly spiraled into disgust and hate.\n\nBefore trying this, I kept seeing mostly negative recommendations, without any explanation why. I really wish they'd mentioned exactly what was wrong with this. I've decided to actually add something to this.\n\nAnd just so you know, I actually spent a good chunk of time on this--I have no idea why it didn't register. It also hasn't even listed any of the achievements I earned, and my character's over level 20.\n\nFor this I'm not going to look at the usual problems all mmo's have; this isn't exactly like every other mmo.\n\nPros:\n>Combat system - It's an arcade-style mmorpg, so it's going to play as an arcade game at times. I actually really like this type of system because it doesn't rely on just chance to hit like the usual mmo.\n>Customizable controls - You can map the controls out to whatever layout suits you best. This is pretty handy if you don't like/aren't used to using just the arrow keys to move\n>Gamepad support - It's pretty awesome to be able to play this with a controller! I always look for that when I see games like this.\n\nMeh:\n>Window resolution - There aren't many options for how big you want the screen to be, and it can be a bother if you're playing on like, a laptop, but as long as you don't mess with the window too much, you won't have any problems.\n\nAnd now, for the bad stuff.\n\nCons:\n>NPC conversations - The dialogue for every character is so broken you can barely understand them. There are so many grammar and punctuation mistakes it's like kindergarteners were typing every bit of text. I don't need the phrasing to be perfect, I just need to understand the details of the quest, and this was impossible most of the time. I even constantly got lost since there were never any directions to the quest area.\n>Adventure progression - I've been in the general area of the starting town literally since I started playing. It feels like the story takes forever to progress, just because some quests take you multiple times through the same dungeon. I'm not even at the second major town yet--it's taking that long. Add to that the weird, broken dialogue, and it'll make you feel like you're trapped in another, foreign world.\n>Combat - I love the concept, but it needs more work. As soon as you hit a map with potential enemies, you're forcibly facing left or right, depending on which general direction has more of either. I didn't really mind it at first, but it got gradually harder and harder to line up attacks. There were a lot of times where I'd miss the target and leave myself wide open; it's sometimes impossible to not get hit immediately afterward. This even happened with bosses several times and almost got me killed.\n>Enemy animation - This is as bad as the NPC dialogue, if not much worse. The enemy animation--usually for bosses--for attacking sometimes just halts, and this can catch you off guard. It's especially bad when you're facing a boss. This is the major reason I was having such a horrible time with the main dungeons. Pretty often when I knocked them over, I couldn't tell when they recovered from it, or that they even did, and they were suddenly immediately up and attacking without any indication that they were getting up.\n>Dungeon rewards - I feel this is THE MOST broken part of the game. Whenever you complete a dungeon run, the rewards you obtain are determined by slot reels. However, when there's more than two, for some reason, you can only stop one reel, and the other two just continue spinning. I'd be okay with it, but the few times I managed to get more than two slots going, the loot the last two stopped on was ALWAYS THE SAME. Not to mention that the amount of rewards per grade isn't even balanced--I actually got more loot at around C or B than A or S, and the highest rank only gets you ONE GOD DAMN SLOT. Seriously, why has this NEVER been fixed??? It's so demoralizing to put so much work into perfectly maiming your enemies and hardly get anything out of it, or thinking you've scored more than one chance at loot and you can't keep it from ending up as the same thing you can't even use. On the subject of the grading system, it's practically impossible to get even a DECENT score without spamming attack skills, and like I said above, it's starting to get harder and harder to tell when an enemy is in contact range. Not to mention getting hit also reduces your score--I wouldn't have a problem with that if the random halting enemy animations didn't catch you by surprise.\n\nIt's a great concept, but this game is broken in more ways than one, and it just seems like there were more bugs than the team could even be bothered to fix. Everything about the dungeons, from the faulty animations to the buggy reward system, is unfair and unjustly frustrating; every bit of text--even the hints--was mostly lost in translation; and almost all the time you're going to get lost, because it's never clear what direction you have to go in.\n\nIn its current state, it's not even fit to be on Steam. To be honest, I doubt even Flowey would recommend this game.\n\nHopefully this will make more sense than all the blank, red No's on here. Hell, their reviews probably melted with their very brains trying to think of one way to save this buggy mess.","January 24","false","0.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

If you enjoy very active hack and slash gameplay in a mmorpg setting, this game will provide you countless hours of just that.\n\nThe art style is very colourful and even childlike at places, but there are also vast dark sections like gloomy caves and fiery volcanic areas. The abilities are simple, yet combine to be very satisfying for both casual and more hardcore players. There are many classes, each with their own unique skill sets that give them all a different feel and look.\n\nThe community is very nice for the most part, the staff are active on social media and on the forums. So there's always someone to help. Support team responds quick enough and is polite, though sometimes the best help comes from the players themselves on the forum. The developers listen, take suggestions and engage in conversation with the players. We players have a lot of control over the direction the game goes in, and that's one very important thing.\n\nThe game has problems due to incompitent developers of the past. Pvp, while being very fun, is not supported by good game modes, ranked pvp or any sort of matchmaking. The group pvp modes have lots of problems. The economy is still recovering and shifting because of the vast history of abuse that has now ended. The translations are quite bad and the game doesn't explain it's self very well.\n\nBut those problems are slowly being fix and the future is, for the first time in a long long time, looking bright for this game.  Overall I recommend everyone to give this game a shot!\n\nJoin us now and you'll get to see the hype surrounding our newest expansion that has been announced to come late this summer!\n","May 13","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loads very quickly and few general bugs.\nVery friendly players from my experience. (Though, a lot of people will tend to steal your kills)\nMarriage and couple perks. (I dunno, I thought it was cute.)\nAnimation and designs are pretty cute looking.\n\n\nCons:\nSteam has a hard time syncing achievments with its system.\nMost main boss missions must be cleared 5+ times. This isn't because of a bug, that's just how quests work.\nCombat is a 3-D side scroller, meaning aiming and positioning can be hard depending on which class you pick.\nVery basic classes, until you reach lvl 20 on a human character to unlock the 'Dragonkin' race.\nDragonkin only has 2 classes to pick from (Shaman and Twins)\nCharacter customization is BEYOND basic. You can choose between maybe 7 hair styles and like 5 facial expressions (unable to change eye colour)\nCan be VERY buggy at times during combat, tends to lag on occasions.\nBroken English, which has even made some quests misleading. (IE 'Dropped from Ember Wolves' when it's actually dropped from Brown Wolves)\nLong walks from area to area if you don't want to use your money to fast travel.\nCan get very tedious if you follow side quests (Which I enjoy personally)\nLore in my opinion is very boring. I watched the starting movie, skip all dialouge, and skim quests (just so I know what to do).\n\nWhile there are more cons than there are pros, I will recommend this game to others as it can be pretty fun. And maybe soon I'll finally figure out if I actually like it or not myself.","January 17","true","38.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy very active hack and slash gameplay in a mmorpg setting, this game will provide you countless hours of just that.\n\nThe art style is very colourful and even childlike at places, but there are also vast dark sections like gloomy caves and fiery volcanic areas. The abilities are simple, yet combine to be very satisfying for both casual and more hardcore players. There are many classes, each with their own unique skill sets that give them all a different feel and look.\n\nThe community is very nice for the most part, the staff are active on social media and on the forums. So there's always someone to help. Support team responds quick enough and is polite, though sometimes the best help comes from the players themselves on the forum. The developers listen, take suggestions and engage in conversation with the players. We players have a lot of control over the direction the game goes in, and that's one very important thing.\n\nThe game has problems due to incompitent developers of the past. Pvp, while being very fun, is not supported by good game modes, ranked pvp or any sort of matchmaking. The group pvp modes have lots of problems. The economy is still recovering and shifting because of the vast history of abuse that has now ended. The translations are quite bad and the game doesn't explain it's self very well.\n\nBut those problems are slowly being fix and the future is, for the first time in a long long time, looking bright for this game.  Overall I recommend everyone to give this game a shot!\n\nJoin us now and you'll get to see the hype surrounding our newest expansion that has been announced to come late this summer!\n","May 13","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
