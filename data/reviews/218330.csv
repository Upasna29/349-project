Not great, not bad. Here's the main problem.\n\nThe game is dead, abandoned by the people who made it. The developers took the money and ran after people bought the 100$ legendary pack, only to rebrand it as "Trans-Galactic Tournament", a PS4 exclusive free-to-play MOBA. I feel ashamed to have supported these scumbags.

No ingame leveling curve means everyone is more or less at the same power level, differentiated of course by their choice of weapons, workouts, and badges, which are all chosen before the match begins.\n\nAlthough there's no ingame leveling, there is a persistent account level that allows you to equip more things as it increases. However, a skilled level 1 player can easily defeat a bad level 40, so the differences between them aren't as game-changing as the numbers might imply.\n\nIt has less depth compared to others in its genre, but then again, it stands a little far out of the field to be considered a DOTA-like anyway, despite what marketing may tell you.\n\nYes, I recommend.\n\nEDIT:\nNovember 6, 2015\n\nApparently, this game is dead. Like, dead dead. I haven't logged on to check.\nMy rating is unchanged. It was a good game. That it is gone is not a black mark against it, otherwise we would have to put a black mark against every game we no longer play now.\n\nBon voyage, SC.","November 4, 2013","true","41.1"," 61 of 77 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","61","77","5","2"

The pace of the game is much closer to that of a team FPS game, just from a top-down view with MOBA-style champions.  There is no in-game farming, money or levels, so there is no runaway snowball effect.  There are multiple game modes, including versions of capture-the-flag and capture-and-hold.  Games usually last between 5 and 15 minutes, depending on the mode.\n\nI've been playing since March, and I'm still enjoying it and still learning new tricks.  The game is still in development, and the dev team is very involved in the community.  They pay a lot of attention to player feedback, and have weekly live-streams where they discuss what they're working on and what they have planned.\n\nCheck it out!","December 13, 2013","true","212.2"," 31 of 42 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","31","42","2","0"

It has many features whoch makes it unique. You can't compare to LOL or DOTA because it's just different.\nYou play a Hero with 3 active and 2 passive skills. You use something called training to buff your Champ the way you want to play him. Similar like LOL especialy with Skins and so on.\nNow the realy unique parts.\nThere are many Modes (which weren't used like that in MOBAs) like:\n-conquering plateformes\n-captureing the flag (called plunderball because it's about a ball)\n-Destroyer. Wher you fight over items which you can feed to an giant Robot which is on the way to fight the one the opponent uses. The Kristals heals and power up your Robot (max lvl 30 healing still useable). And you can fight the Robot. It's just like a moving Torret.\n-Torret. You fight in two lanes with Towers and in the mid is a plateform where you can collect a bomb which explode after 30 sec. this is fun because you can make many Dmg on Hero goups, minions or Torrets but have to pay attantion that you don't kill youself or teammates.\nNext point the unique Levels:\n-You have plateforms and you can jump. which means you can Fight on different hights and jump form place to place or use teammates or something you summon to jump on high plateforms.\n- You have  holes in the ground which can cause you to push an other Hero inside them with a push effect and kill him instantly quite funny.\n- You have powerups on the map like restoring Energy (mana), Health or gain Speed.\n\nI'm realy sad that I can't connect to servers anymore. But it seems that you can't get free to play games like this to work especially if you make it to easy to gain outfits or new weapons.\nI'd wish there'd be a LAN modi where i could create a server on my own to play it with friends on Partys.","October 2, 2014","true","196.2"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","16","21","2","0"

Definitely a hidden diamond in a tub of worthless rocks. A beautifully designed, well thought out layout and gameplay, and unique game types exclusively only seen within SmashMuck Champions (SMC). A gem it is, and hidden from the internet it will die. Definitely encourage giving the game a shot as it definitely has solid potential. I do just wish the developers abstained from releasing it to steam for free play. Without a proper spotlight on the game since SMC had left Alpha developement stage, steam has assured that they wish the game does suffer, or survive on not only promoting for itself, but, in addition, hand-in-hand requiring SMC to promote for steam just to get the recognition it so strongly deserves.\n\nIn my honest opinion, this game has made me question the structural integrity of valve. Without even the slightest of indulgences to such a strong standing game, it's clear to me that Origin will win the push-and-pull of PC Game Hub Software power struggle... that is, of course, if steam is unable to spotlight even the most promising of games within its warehouse.

The interface, the tutorials, all of it are just confusing. I left the game in a tutorial to see where to go and when I came back I COULDN'T FIND THE TUTORIAL, TO HAVE IT REAPPER THREE GAMES LATER!!!!! I may be stupid, but the currency in this game is too. the gold is like real money, and you cant earn it from what I've done. the other stuff takes WAY to long to earn, just so you pay for the skin, and hero you want, EVEN THOUGH BUYING HERO'S IS POINTLESS!!!!! I paid for a hero, Brutus, after playing him in three matches, thinking he was somehow limited. NOPE! that's just BRUTUS!! it is somewhat fun if the teams are balanced and people know how to use these classes, but the classes ARE NOT BALANCED it seems, either that, or the 4 matches I played were full of people who didn't know what to do. I liked this game for its originality, but, ultimatley it seems just so plain, that it sort of pains me. there is team deathmatch, death match, control points, and capture the flag. thats it.\n\nI would've recommended this game, if it wasn't so plain.\nplease developers, help this game, and the community.","May 17, 2014","false","2.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

I suggest you buy a package though if you want to get serious wiff this game.  oh Aww yi, pick Ninjette omg, Op ftw.  I am Ninjette and I kick butt.\n\nRecommend this game for anyone that has a busy life and just comes home to relax and wants to play a relaxing game of adventure and fighting.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MilesOCrien/recommended/218330/","MilesOCrien","Miles O'Crien","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MilesOCrien/","114 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReally nice fast paced action MOBA, and fairly easy to get into if you're new to those types of games. It has several game modes, those being Plunder Ball(CTF), Siege(Typical MOBA style), Gauntlet(Horde mode), and by far my favorite game mode so far, Destroyer. Destroyer is a a bit of a resource gathering mode where you collect crystals to power up your destroyer(giant stone golem) to get it all powered up to crush the enemy team.\n\nI find it to be rather fair on the free to play model with everything in game being able to be earned with either in game currency you get after matches, or crafting with parts you get from the daily challenges. The only items you can't get besides with premium currency are taunts that your character preforms during the pre game introduction, and out on the field, and even the month long events can give you a chance to get enough premium currency to buy those.\n\nThe only downsides so far to the game is just not enough people play it, so you can have a bit of a wait just to get into a match from 5-10mins, to going almost an hour when the game has a low amount of players online. Oh, and current lack of in game supported voice chat since you won't have enough time to coordinate with your team through typing unless you're waiting for respawn.","December 23, 2013","true","81.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The controls are really weird and don't seem responsive at all, and the interface is tedious to navigate.

Sadly it got crippled by a lot of bad moves left and right, and now this game is for all accounts 'dead'. From a Early Access launch that had it's servers crash when the player load went over 300 or so for week among weeks on end, towards chat breaking every other hour, to people joining games filled only with bots when it should have had other players outright, this game did very little to leave a good taste in people's mouths.\n\nSad too as it honestly had one of the better unlock systems around, you gaining the noraml 'cash' to unlock champs, gear, and 'runes', but also on top of this a crafting system that would let you get things by combing stuff you would get for daily playing. From champs, to skins, to pretty much everything avalable, it gave the player a roulette on top of the normal system that just made it more fair, sure you didn't know WHAT champ you would get with crafting, but at least you where garenteed one, and if you got one you already had, you could recraft it again!\n\nIt was also controlled via WASD, meaning movement was quite precise and exact, a far better cry from your normal 'MOBA'. Add onto it the different game modes of "king of the hill" and "Capture the flag", would ensure that you could always mix it up in case one mode was starting to get too stale. The only other note is the gear, in that it was always a trade off. The starting gear was always a nice balance between suviablity, and a little extra damage, with all of the extra weapons for each champ more specalized into a different playing style or strength, but only for that one thing,  meaning that weapons never felt like an end all, be all for any one charater, but more just a way to enchance your own playing style with them just a bit.\n\nOverall thought, the servers towards this day still are a mess, most people gave up on it ages ago, and at the end it's just a mess of promises and dreams never realised thanks to that.","May 23, 2014","false","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's very streamlined, which seasoned MOBA players might not be too keen on but I personally found made it much easier to get into than games like League of Legends and DOTA 2. I'd say if you're looking for a MOBA to start out with, this is a very, very solid choice. Not to mention it's an absolute blast to play with friends. If you need any more evidence that the game is fun to play, I've been recording my sessions playing it with a friend of mine.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uqu_InA_U14&list=UUPhVxopWpXWy-qHMXRVPLEQ","July 19, 2014","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are unreal, especially on my horrible PC. Honestly everyone should pick this up and try it. It's borderline MOBA but honestly it's more of a top down PVP arena that makes you go crazy. This game is amazing if you have a couple friends that are willing to download it (it's a small file, might as well) and just ♥♥♥♥ around on it. With so many unique things that seperate it from (really) every game there is, it's an easy pick up, especially for the wonderful price of free.","January 26, 2014","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
