I was still playing the first one up to the release of this game and continued playing it during this one.  But VH2 not only left off where the last story ended, but improved on tons of things to make this game even more enjoyable than the first.  So with this in mind, I wrote a review for people new to the series as well as one for people who have played the first game and are considering getting this one.\n\nNewcomers to the Van Helsing trilogy-\nEven if you haven't played the first one, it would still be enjoyable to start with VH2.  The reason for this is much like any other game, such as Borderlands 2.  Playing the first one AFTER the second one will give you more depth in the story as well as make you appreciate all the changes that were done in the second game.  Even though I would recommend playing the first one first, I don't see any spoilers at all in VH2 to the storyline of VH1.  There are even items/gear that is reverse compatible ;) which you will probably think is pretty keen of the developers.  Yes, it plays like Diablo 3, but that is by all means not a bad thing.  But that comparison is very similar to saying Battlefield plays like CoD or MoH.  And what about the "Gears of War" and "God of War" comparisons in other games.  Yah, it's kinda like that :/  All in all, if you get VH2, you will be getting a great funny and very enjoyable RPG which you can co op up to 4 players as well as PvP.  When you play it, you'll know it's going to be a great game from the photobomb on the title screen[www.twitch.tv] hahaha.\n\nOnes who've played the first Van Helsing-\nIt may look like the same game but many things have been polished to fit customer satisfaction.  For instance there are still 6 pages of storage, but now most of the gear takes 2 blocks instead of 3, and the storage space has been significantly expanded.  So now there is over double the storage space of the first game.  Along with the max level reaching 60 instead of 30, there are doubled the skills to mess around with!  So you have the option of lvl10ing the skills and tricks you have ported over OR taking them off and starting a whole new tree of new abilities.  Or you can even mix it.  Oh yeah, as I stated, you can export over your powered up character from the first game :)  The Chimera is not as powerful as it looks but is still a great addition as well as a little storyline within the sp story.  Also the 'sets' and 'epics' have 'ink infested' versions which are level 60s.  So even though you may have a complete set with the level ranges at 33 38 and 45, you can still farm for the all level 60 versions of that same set :))))  OMG, and wait until you get your first 'godlike' item!!!  Besides that they just expanded on everything that made the first game so fun to play like: glory, perks, weapons & gear, laughs, easter eggs, tower defense, etc.  The story, I would like to compare to The Matrix Reloaded.  Not the best story, but essential in the trilogy and to any fan of the first game.  It was also fun to play through with more boss fights and loot drops.  So basically, I would definitely recommend this game if you've played through the first one even just once.\n\nThe DLCs-\nI've written separate reviews on each DLC.\n\n\nRating: 9/10","October 29, 2014","true","163.4"," 175 of 202 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","175","202","0","4"

The original game had its problems, but had enough atmosphere and quirky humor and story for me to enjoy it.  Where VH excelled, VH2 does not.\n\nPros:\n1) Game's atmosphere is beautiful.  I particularly like the outside areas.  Unfortunately, very little of your gameplay experience takes place outside.\n\nCons:\n1) They attempted to fix the lackluster skill tree from the original game.  The original lacked choices and most of the skills were useless.  They did a complete 180 and the skill tree still sucks.  Now, it is oversaturated with no coherent structure.  Certain skills unlock other skills but have no function in relation to those skills.  For example, Want to build around ice damage?  Pick one skill on the right, arbitrarily attached to some fire and lightning.  Then, try to pick a skill on the left, arbitrarily attached to other random skills.  Makes no sense.\n\n2) Balance.  Game balance is awful.  I played the original game on the hardest difficulty [I play most ARPGs on the hardest difficulty].  VH2 seems to have mobs that are weak [on any difficulty] and mobs that do an incredible amount of dmg on any difficulty other than "casual".  Even if I built my character around heavy defensive passives/tricks ranged/casting things [which tend to do more dmg in general] hit BRUTALLY hard.  There's also the occasional 1 shot from a challenging to see ability when swamped in a pack of mobs.\nEdit: I've now played through the game with a second character.  My first was a thaumaturge that really struggled with balance.  My second was the original hunter character, but built around spell-casting.  I played my second time on hard/heroic difficulties - stacked the mana shield defensive ability and some other defensives, and could face-roll pretty much anything so long as I had mana.  Again, certain skills are way more powerful than others, effectively making the oversaturated skill tree still feel problematic.\nEdit Two: Played more on the thaumaturge on heroic.  Balance is really what is holding the game back.  Built my character around abilities that could do damage while moving and crit chance/crit dmg [crit chance around 32-35%, crit dmg maxed @ 450%], and high HP, made heroic pretty easy.  The problem, though, is sometimes you just get 1 shot from off-screen, even with high damage reduction.  Difficulty basically scales like this: Mobs have higher health making it take longer to kill them.  High dmg abilities do insane dmg and can result in 1 shots.  The longer a mob lives, the greater chance of a 1 shot.  Not sure how they can really fix this, but it makes build diversity fairly limited.  At a certain point you just have to be able to do damage while moving and you have to spec heavily into defense.\n\n3) Storyline/Quests.  This is really my main qualm with the game.  The storyline of this game is really disappointing.  Maybe the storyline isn't disappointing [as it makes sense in the context of VH1], but the way it is executed is disappointing.  The questing sucks.  Very little variation, mostly based around tower defense.  The vast majority of your missions are "secure X, Y, Z points by battling through streams of enemies.  This was my least favorite type of mission in VH and it seems to be what the entirety of VH2 is built around.  If I wanted to play Tower Defense, I'd play Tower Defense.  The final boss fight, spoiler alert, is not even a fight.  You literally kill streams of enemies until his force field's HP hits 1.  He then blows up and the game ends on a pathetic attempt at a cliff hanger.  I understand the attempt at a military strategy/real-time invasion, but it simply fails to be enjoyable.\n\n4) End Game:  It's about what you expect.  You get "random" dungeons [just reskinned areas of the main story] and tasks to complete within them.  Some of them also have interesting things that makes them substantially more difficult [Your companion won't help, can't regen life/mana, etc].  I did a few of them on heroic difficulty.  They were a challenge.  The quirky interactions don't take place between Katarina/Helsing so it's basically just the mindless challenge of slaughtering enemies with certain affixes that make the already poorly balanced gameplay more difficult.  I'm glad they added this feature.  Unfortunately, it does not do much for me because I've already done a lot of this in Path of Exile AND Path of Exile's system is better.  All in all, I think it will be fun for people who haven't already beaten the model to death in other games, but wasn't real fun for me.\n\n5) Multiplayer:  Much like during the launch of the first game [in which it wasn't even functional], multiplayer is quite buggy.  In fact, I've only successfully joined 1 game [I've tried to join many], and the host disconnected shortly thereafter, rendering my efforts obsolete.  I've also tried hosting multiple times.  I will get a message that "x is trying to join your game", but they are never successful in doing so.  Not sure if it is a bug, a lack of stable connection, or what, but multiplayer seems quite hit or miss.\n\nVerdict:\n\nIf you did not play the first game, don't buy this.  The first is a much more complete experience.\nIf you loved the first and are desperate to see where the story goes, buy this.\nIf you loved the first for what it was, and aren't too attached to the story, don't buy this.\nThe game simply lacks what made the first game worth playing - the quirky nature, originality, and great atmosphere - while not really fixing any of the detracting factors of the first game [lack of real diversity via skill tree].","May 24, 2014","false","24.5"," 544 of 721 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","544","721","2","43"

The roundup of news continues with an unprecedented Runecrafting system, simple to master but unexpected depth, and a new management mode of our allies within the resistance. Add to this the return of particular Tower Defense mode and get back in your hands one of the best quality/price ratios currently available for any fan of action-RPG.

It played exactly like the first game, which for me was a very good thing.  I played the first game on heroic to offer some challege, as anything less and it seemed I would just steamroll the enemies.  I imported my Hunter character (I finished the first game with the Hunter and the Thaumaturge, but I could never get the hang of the  Arcane Mechanic) and the game started up on the heroic difficulty.  It was much more difficult this time around.  I don't know if I was under-geared, as I could never complete the post storyline challenge quests from the first game, or if they just upped the difficulty in general.  The loot drops were appropriate and generous.\n\nOverall, I am really looking forward to this release.  I am really excited that all your equipment, gold, and character skills carry over.\n\nYou will learn to loathe the throngs of flying robots that shoot electricity.

The game starts out a bit slow but after you get a couple of hours in, its non-stop action and excitement. A must-have for any action role-playing fans. There are numerous skills and perks to customize your character, a multitude of magic items and artifacts, rare monster trophies, many extensive sidequests,  runecrafting,  and more that is sure to keep you entertained for many hours. Controllers are fully supported and there are several multiplayer options as well. While Van Helsing II is mostly hack and slash combined with RPG elements, it also has a well developed tower defense game weaved into the story along with numerous sidequests that add to the fun.\n\nThis game has many great features that would easily fool you into believing it was developed with a massive gaming budget. The storyline is great, the soundtrack is perfect for the mood, the voice acting is superb, the graphics are rich with detail, and the gothic art is simply astonishing. It does so many things right and that is rare, even from many of the bigger studios.\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II plays out much like its predecessor and picks the story up right at the end of the original (although it can be enjoyed without having played the first one). In fact, there is an option that allows you to import your favorite characters from the first game. However, it has several key improvements, most notably, the game offers several character classes from the beginning and even more skills/perks to suit different play styles instead of adding them as DLC like in the original game. The tower defense portion of the game has been improved and enriches the story.  The User Interface has been re-designed and is much better. The graphics have been improved as well and really give you that gothic feel. And don't forget about the DLC's included in the Complete Package. The Pigasus DLC introduces a new lair NPC pet that you can send out into the Ink to search for rare magic artifacts and weapons. The Ink Hunt DLC is an extension of the game that adds 4 new maps along with quests and nmissions to extend the overall game and can only be played after the base game is finished.\n\nThe Good:\n=======+  Nice graphics/artwork\n+  Quality soundtrack\n+  Well-written storyline and good voice acting\n+  Numerous character cusomization options\n+  Several Multiplayer options\n+  High replay value\n+  Steam Trading Cards & Achievements\n+  Full controller support\n+  Quality DLC\n+  Well designed user interface\n+  Smooth graphics\n+  Active developer support with updates\n+  Many customization options for game, sound, video, hotkeys\n\nThe Bad:\n======-  Long Intro video\n-  Initial learning curve is high (it gets easier)\n-  Slow  loading at startup\n-  A few bugs still remain (not game breaking)\n-  Changing between controller/mouse requires re-launch\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n===========This game is nothing like it was when it was first released on Steam. Originally, there were many who had issues with bugs and crashes but the developers have actively worked to fix them and still remain involved in the community. Since then, this game has vastly improved and new features are still being added. The game is very entertaining and offers a lot of quality content for the price. I strongly recommend this game to all action role-playing fans. It has quickly become one of the best available and I look forward to a Van Helsing III.\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","February 28, 2015","true","68.3"," 55 of 70 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","55","70","0","4"

Even though I'm sure I didn't get the BEST deal out there I'd say it's money well spent.\n\nI never played the first game.  So, I started on this one with a new toon and leveled him up to 30 by the time I beat the game on Hard Mode.  Then,  went to veteran mode afterwards on fearless and had a blast. The loot was much better on the higher settings and for those who like crafting -- you can spend a good amount of time sifting through loot to enchant and enhance your gear to get the most defense/offense out of them.  If you don't like crafting then I'd stay away from that part.\n\nReplay value is fairly good.  The story itself isn't spectacular, but if you're going for achievements it's always nice to get a few new options when you do the second run through.  If you don't want replay value.  It took me roughly 28 hours to beat it first time through on hard mode.  So, again worth the ten bucks I spent.  Voice acting for main toons is good, and side characters is a bit shady from time to time, but overall good with music that is also good.  Nothing was annoying to my ears.\n\nTower defense is tricky.  Harder the mode you put it on the less likely you are to succeed.

This is for multiple reasons, the first being that this is a continuation of the highly enjoyable first game, so you’re more likely to have an understanding and appreciation of the storyline. You are also given the option to carry over your character from the first game, including all skills and items, a feature which I was very pleased to see.\n\nJust as the first, this game is a solid ARPG which puts Diablo 3 to shame. The art style and steampunk atmosphere is very well done and pleasant to explore. Gameplay graphics are great, although the cutscenes seem to stand out as being of lesser quality.\n\nLike the first game you are joined by your ghostly companion, Katarina. You have the option to allow her to aid you in battle, or to put her in ghost form where she neither deals nor receives damage, instead providing you with a damage reduction bonus.\n\nThere are a wide variety of skills to choose from for both you and Katarina. It’s easy to spread yourself a little thin when it comes to the somewhat large skill tree, but if you play it smart you can easily tailor it to suit your preferred playstyle.\n\nThere are tower-defense minigames, which I happen to enjoy but if you’re not a fan you can easily skip them with no penalty. You are also given control over captains, who you can send to take care of issues which are apparently beneath you. This is a new feature, adding a bit more strategy to the game as you must decide which of the captains in your command is best suited for the task at hand.\n\nYou'll be surprised at just how many great references are hidden throughout the game. I will refrain from mentioning any so as not to spoil them for anyone. If you are like me and try to fully explore each map you will be greatly rewarded with references, loot, and fun.\n\nMy biggest issue with this game is the ending, which I found to be a bit underwhelming and extremely predictable. This is by no means a big enough deal to ruin the game, but it is worth mentioning.","June 26, 2014","true","19.3"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","0"

Those issues have since been fixed, and developer Neocore Games has learned a lot in the process, it seems. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II does what a sequel is known for and improves on the core idea of Van Helsing while adding enough content to justify a sequel.\nThe story of Van Helsing II picks up right after the end of the first game. In case players completely forgot the plot or never played it, the opening cinematic does a superb job of catching everyone up. Essentially -- the city of Borgovia needs defending, and Van Helsing just so happens to be pretty great at exactly that. Simple enough.\nIn addition, a mysterious character simply named "Prisoner Seven" is involved, helping out Van Helsing throughout his adventure. However, Seven's intentions are the definition of vague, leaving the player and Van Helsing to always question his motives. The plot isn't too far off the beaten path and gets pretty predictable, but it's decently written and very well voiced in order to keep the player's attention throughout. The first game's humor comes back in full force, however this time its done with much more tact.\nPlayers now have the ability to make Van Helsing one of three classes available, instead of being forced into a single role like in the original game. In addition to the classic Hunter, players can opt to make Van Helsing a Thaumaturge or an Arcane Mechanic. Each class plays very differently from the next, and there are loads of customization options within each class themselves, almost ensuring that two players will not play alike. Players may also import their characters from the first game if they wish.\nKatarina, the "ghost with a snappy wit" returns in the sequel and can also be customized a ton. She feels much more fully fleshed out than in the first game and she even filled the classic "tank" role pretty well during my playthrough. Her AI can be extremely customized, which allows her to not feel like dead weight the entire time. Plus, she can hold on to excess items, go back to town and sell them, and even go buy potions.\nThe tower defense mini-game makes its return, which is a mode that I wasn't too fond of in the original due to lack of direction. I am happy to say, however, that Van Helsing II gives this mode the care and dedication it deserves, making it leagues better. The towers are more interesting, the maps feel better designed, and the package as a whole comes together nicely.\nVan Helsing  is also in charge of resistance commanders now, and can send one of his commanders out to do his bidding for him. Managing these commanders is a mini-game in itself, as each one has certain tactics they are better at and sending the wrong one can mean a mission failure.\nThe visual design of enemies in Van Helsing II is great, offering up some truly bizarre foes to take down throughout the campaign. Their behaviors are varied enough so that every enemy doesn't simply run straight towards the player, though many do. The visual style is alright, though things are overly shiny and can be a bit muddy as well.\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II is a much better showing than the original. It's what a sequel should be; it improves on nearly everything while adding brand new ideas to the pile. Best of all, the core gameplay mechanics are still a blast to use and really spice up a genre that if often left untouched. It certainly has its shortcomings, but fans of games like the Diablo series, Torchlight, Titan Quest, or Path of Exile will love it.\n","July 25, 2015","true","30.0"," 41 of 53 people (77%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","77","41","53","4","0"

Game's story lasts for about 15 hours at normal pace, but there are possibilities to continue playing if one wishes to: the story can be replayed at higher difficulty and there are scenarios that are certain non-randomized levels with varying challenges for end-game.\n\nMy advice is to play the first game first (because it is pretty good too), then import the character into the second game (just a button click away) and continue the story with 30 new levels of skills. Van Helsing II is otherwise a very nice game, good-looking steam-punk theme, good voice acting and an entertaining story, plus a lot of parody and great humour with references to various pop culture. Game play offers three classes and there are several builds to explore. Tons of items, including legendary and set items.\n\nGame runs smoothy, with an occassional crash (had about 3-4 crashes during 20 hours), but game saves frequently so one seldom looses progress. No other issues encountered here. Combat is fun and satisfying, and it is very entertaining to explore the world. This is actually the first game of this style where I bothered to pay attention to the story and other lore-related details.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/272470/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","Van Helsing has his work cut out for him. For all the monsters he's slain, the looming spectres of Diablo, Torchlight, and Path of Exile cast an imposing shadow over the rugged hero. To set itself apart, this modern dungeon crawler has to find a way to truly sink its claws into the player beyond the usual loot'n'grind. The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II, the second part of a planned trilogy by Neocore Games, succeeds remarkably in carving out its own identity, but at the potentially steep price of polish and balance.\n\nThe visuals and soundwork of Van Helsing II are competent, with a few bright spots. The graphics are technically solid, with varied color palettes that provide atmosphere as Van Helsing explores underground caverns, snowy forests, and laboratories full of disgusting experiments. The voice acting is serviceable and the musical score is suitably sweeping and epic, with a few catchy songs, but nothing new for the genre.\n\nA common criticism of dungeon crawlers is that they start off slowly, and Van Helsing II does everything in its power to defy that stereotype. Players of the first Van Helsing will be pleased to find that they can import their character into the sequel, with all of their skills and equipment intact. Newcomers are able to create a character of one of the three classes -- the iconic Hunter, the mage-like Thaumaturge, and the tech-oriented Arcane Mechanic -- that begins at level 30, giving them a set of gear and plenty of skillpoints to spend. Those who find the game's in-depth, granular skill system a little too daunting can start at level 1 without any major handicaps, giving them more time to learn the deep mechanics of the game.\n\nThese mechanics are much of what set Van Helsing II apart, but also where this ambitious title first stumbles. The game is unapologetically complex; each class has four primary stats and access to dozens of abilities, all of which can be upgraded up to ten times. There are plenty of ways to construct a character, but unfortunately, not all of them are viable. Many skills pale in comparison to others within the same tree, and it's easy to find yourself with a build that simply doesn't work. Luckily, a respecialization option is both cheap and accessible, making it easy enough to experiment until a satisfactory skillset is found.\n\nThere is a lot of content in Van Helsing II, and most of it is implemented well. The usual prerequisites for the genre are in place: a lengthy storyline with plenty of side quests, co-operative multiplayer modes for both the campaign and individual scenarios, and a 'Battle Royal' PvP offering for those wishing to test their mettle against other players. What sets Van Helsing II apart, however, is its dedication to making its single-player experience memorable to the player. Throughout the fifteen to twenty hour campaign, Van Helsing spends plenty of time fighting his way through hordes of enemies, but he also fortifies and defends his Secret Lair (yes, that's what it's called in the game).\n\nThe Lair -- the heart of the Resistance movement of which Van Helsing is a critical agent-- is unlocked early in the game, and houses merchants, alchemists, and enchanters capable of modifying and upgrading Van Helsing's equipment. It also grants access to a couple of additional minigames that add much-needed variety to the usual action-adventure fare, including tower defense-style sequences in which Van Helsing must prevent the antagonist's forces from discovering the Resistance's hideout, and a menu-driven command center where the player can build a small army and send them on missions that grant equipment and monetary rewards. Though fairly basic in design, both of these distractions are plenty of fun, and I often found myself teleporting back to base to play with them between campaign missions.\n\nThe combat itself doesn't introduce any shocking twists, but it stands proudly with the best in the genre. With eight of his abilities available on the skill bar at any given time, Van Helsing is never lacking for tools with which to fight, and a generous cooldown on potions and plenty of ways to restore health and mana keep things moving at a tight pace. Enemy variety is impressive, with three or four new kinds of foes introduced in each zone, and multiple difficulty levels allow players to suit the challenge to their preferences. The biggest problem that I found was that pure melee characters never really come into their own. Every class has ranged options (and, in fact, the Hunter is the only one that can melee at all), but for all the depth of the skill trees, there's no real way to avoid the punishment that comes from being surrounded by the game's dangerous enemies. It's certainly possible to succeed with a melee-oriented build, it just never reaches the destructive potential of the other choices.\n\nIt's a good thing, too, because the plot of the campaign doesn't stand too well on its own. The storyline is basic, but decent enough: after slaying the evil Professor Fulmigati in the first game, Van Helsing finds that the exiled General Harker has returned to take his place. Setting out on a mission to overthrow the new government, the monster hunter is joined once again by the ghost Katarina, who has to be one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever encountered in a videogame. A constant presence at Van Helsing's side, she's an endless font of overwrought sarcasm and grating negativity; in the first two hours of the game alone, she voices her distrust of a new character seven times. I counted. As if to make things worse, she and Van Helsing trade uninspired quips with depressing regularity; the tone of the story, which can get fairly dark at times, is completely offset by the constant, heavy-handed references to games, books, and movies the pair make. Occasionally, a gem of a line can inspire a smile, but for the most part, it's a distracting and desperate attempt at humor.\n\nFurther putting a dent in things are the technical issues. The game isn't particularly buggy, at least not in the conventional sense, but it found some creative ways to hamper my enjoyment. Load times are far too long for a game of this size, and even inexplicably happen just from alt-tabbing. The camera is solid enough during gameplay, but in cutscenes, it has a habit of taking nauseating jaunts for seemingly no reason. Oftentimes, a scene with two characters simply standing on either side of a table discussing tactics is lent a surreal air as the perspective randomly changes.\n\nDespite these problems, it's hard not to recommend Van Helsing II. Most of the issues it has feel like the inevitable consequences of making an ambitious game on a small budget, and I have to applaud Neocore Games for packing so much content into their latest endeavor.","February 23","true","97.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","15","17","2","0"

I was still playing the first one up to the release of this game and continued playing it during this one. But VH2 not only left off where the last story ended, but improved on tons of things to make this game even more enjoyable than the first. So with this in mind, I wrote a review for people new to the series as well as one for people who have played the first game and are considering getting this one.\n\nNewcomers to the Van Helsing trilogy-\nEven if you haven't played the first one, it would still be enjoyable to start with VH2. The reason for this is much like any other game, such as Borderlands 2. Playing the first one AFTER the second one will give you more depth in the story as well as make you appreciate all the changes that were done in the second game. Even though I would recommend playing the first one first, I don't see any spoilers at all in VH2 to the storyline of VH1. There are even items/gear that is reverse compatible ;) which you will probably think is pretty keen of the developers. Yes, it plays like Diablo 3, but that is by all means not a bad thing. But that comparison is very similar to saying Battlefield plays like CoD or MoH. And what about the "Gears of War" and "God of War" comparisons in other games. Yah, it's kinda like that :/ All in all, if you get VH2, you will be getting a great funny and very enjoyable RPG which you can co op up to 4 players as well as PvP. When you play it, you'll know it's going to be a great game from the photobomb on the title screen hahaha.\n\nOnes who've played the first Van Helsing-\nIt may look like the same game but many things have been polished to fit customer satisfaction. For instance there are still 6 pages of storage, but now most of the gear takes 2 blocks instead of 3, and the storage space has been significantly expanded. So now there is over double the storage space of the first game. Along with the max level reaching 60 instead of 30, there are doubled the skills to mess around with! So you have the option of lvl10ing the skills and tricks you have ported over OR taking them off and starting a whole new tree of new abilities. Or you can even mix it. Oh yeah, as I stated, you can export over your powered up character from the first game :) The Chimera is not as powerful as it looks but is still a great addition as well as a little storyline within the sp story. Also the 'sets' and 'epics' have 'ink infested' versions which are level 60s. So even though you may have a complete set with the level ranges at 33 38 and 45, you can still farm for the all level 60 versions of that same set :)))) OMG, and wait until you get your first 'godlike' item!!! Besides that they just expanded on everything that made the first game so fun to play like: glory, perks, weapons & gear, laughs, easter eggs, tower defense, etc. The story, I would like to compare to The Matrix Reloaded. Not the best story, but essential in the trilogy and to any fan of the first game. It was also fun to play through with more boss fights and loot drops. So basically, I would definitely recommend this game if you've played through the first one even just once.\n\nThe DLCs-\nI've written separate reviews on each DLC.\n\n\nRating: 9/10","April 10","true","2.3"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","12","13","5","0"

Single player works fine up to a point, and multiplayer suffers from a variety of issues that makes it unplayable (unless you like restarting the game everytime it crashes).  Playing multiplayer along side with nephews in Story Mode yielded broken quests that carried over to the Single Player mode - we were unable to continue playing because one of the quests was glitched, "Power of Perum - Part 3 - Kill the Adpets" (can't kill something that's not there!!) even switching back to Single Player mode brought us back to the same glitched quest.  We tried restarting the game several times and selecting the Respawn Monsters under Options > Gameplay, but same thing.  Multiplayer crashes whenever you try to teleport to your friend's location or if they're still in a loading screen.\n\nWe played the first one without any major issues affecting gameplay, but the sequel seemed to be a rush-job - looks nice, but it's broken.  Ideally, we wanted to try the PvP areas once we hit 60 but if the quests are broken they can't level up unless they grind all day (but where's the fun in that).  Additionally, the pre-order armor set was somewhat of a joke since you'll level up pretty quickly past 30 to make it obsolete.\n\nI played a new character up to 60 without issue in Single Player.  My opinion, the Multiplayer Mode is broken and will break any quests even going back to Single Player Mode.   There are a vast number of in-game perks that have been added, but not very intuitive.  Some items, like "The Ring of Guidance" - will instruct you to perform certain tasks, but the instructions are unclear and it fails to do anything.  Crafting is either broken or they made the instructions a secret - I've yet to figure out how to craft something, but ended up just selling all my crafting items for gold (much more productive).   Enchanting is much easier, but costly.  Trying to get a particular enchant from random can cost you millions of gold in a few minutes... would've been nice to see if the enchant was available prior to blowing millions on something that'll never come.  And lastly, the Chimera... annoying to hear him chase/hack on the NPC cat in the Lair.  Even after sending him off on a hunt he can still be heard chasing/hacking on the NPC cat in the Lair... ended up turning off Battle Sounds completely to get rid of the annoyance.\n\nOverall, the story is great, Single Player Mode works, but Multiplayer Mode is broken and will break your Single Player Mode game.  Sadly, we'll be passing on this for several months and may return to it once it's "finished".  Until then, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a Multiplayer Game as I initially hoped to play with my nephews.  If you're looking to just play solo, then it'll be worth it.","May 31, 2014","false","161.2"," 26 of 39 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","26","39","0","3"

Finished it singleplayer with a completely new character (i.e. I didn't start in veteran mode) in like 16 hours I believe, but I did not find all the secrets. Started veteran and I'm still having fun with slightly harder enemies and - of course - better SHINIES. Hopefully I won't miss things this time.\n\nThe story was fine, although a few things were predictable, but I didn't mind. OST is great, Katarina is awesome again - although I'd wish for a few new lines instead of those we already know from VH1 (mainly talking about her reactions to "send to town"). Also perhaps different voice packs for different class (you have three to choose from). But still, I can't complain much about the visuals nor sound (some monsters sound stupid when they get hit repeatedly, but whatever). VH2 also has several new features compared to VH1, mainly Chimera (I'm not gonna spoil it, but it's a fun thing) and generals (or whatever they were called, those guys you send out to do missions). And the tower defense minigame is back (this time we have 6 different levels).\n\nThe only thing I fear about is multiplayer, since I've heard that there are still MP bugs, similar to those VH1 had. However, as I haven't played MP yet, I'm only mentioning things I've read on the forums - nothing I've experienced myself. I did have some trouble with VH1 multiplayer, though...\n\nDid I mention the OST and Katarina are great? No? Well, OST and Katarina are great.\n\ntl;dr: Buy it if you like aRPGs.\n\nEDIT: So, I now had a chance to play multiplayer. In fact, went through the whole first playthrough with a friend and on the veteran one now. Yes, this game still has some glitches, but not even half as bad as VH1. No more incredible, random lags during any dialogue. I (as a non-host) did crash a few times, maybe thrice during that one playthrough. There are other glitches such as "invulnerability bubbles" staying on champions despite them being vulnerable (you can see their HP go down, though, so that's a clear indication they're not immortal ;-)), had some (mostly allied) characters keep running into a wall, etc. But the gameplay is smooth and frankly - I'd say that considering my friend's laggy connection (he lags on TeamSpeak!) this game somehow manages to workaround those lags well. Well, that's if you get used to the fact that each of your hit is slightly delayed, but that's not a problem after you play for a bit. I don't even pay attention to that anymore.\n\nSo, yes, this is still "thumbs up" and still "definitely recommended".","January 11, 2015","true","67.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

You MUST specialize in a few specific skills to be effective. I used the same 3-4 skills through the whole game.\n-Better (more consistent) difficulty curve than the first game. Not without it's spikes though.\n- More forgiving than the first game.\n-Aside from a small complaint or two (See below) I never ran into any bugs or glitches.\n-A lot of skills. This merits multiple playthroughs.\n\nCons:\n-I started with keyboard and mouse. The problem with this is with this setup, you have to click on specific enemies to shoot them. If you don’t click on an enemy, your character just walks to that place instead. So i ended up walking into fight when I intended to fight from a distance.

It will be fun, they said. No one ever mentioned something about a doomsday device!”\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing 2 contains all the best elements of the first game, and introduces novelties in form of bigger and more varied skill trees for all three classes and additional mini games, that contribute to the games atmosphere.\n\nIn comparison with its predecessor the general level of difficulty has been increased, resulting in a more challenging world of Borgovia, that is filled with original monsters, magic and weird technology. At the same time the skills of your ghostly companion have also been rebalanced, allowing her to support you in your preferred playstyle in a more effective way.\n\nBut the greatest strength of Van Helsing lies in its love for detail. Allusions to certain films, comics and the original book by Bram Stoker are proof of that. Furthermore, the protagonist and his delightful ghostly companion will keep you entertained with their wry sense of humor and many snappy dialogues.\n\nNevertheless, there are a few shortcomings. One of them is the stiff combat system, as already encountered in the first instalment, which would have needed more attention to establish a more fluent hack & slash feeling. Another point is the storyline. While building on the events of the predecessor, the presentation of the story feels rather loveless, making it relatively easy to predict certain story related events.\n\nTrivia:\n\nPlease do not open the cell of the familiar looking psychopath with cannibalistic tendencies, who prefers Chianti to certain cuisine.

However, it does suffer from various loading issues which may annoy some, but is easily solved with an SSD.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleathedjinn/recommended/272470/","fleathedjinn","Baby-Legs O'Houlihan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleathedjinn/","383 products in account","The return of Van Helsing was heralded with much excitement and anticipation to the return of hunting beasties and baddies throughout the Romanian-inspired expanse of Borgovia, but it was met with disappointment and hands thrown up in confused defeat.\n\nLike the first installment, The Incredibly Long Title of Van Helsing II (herein referred to as Helsing II) places the player in control of the gruff speaking monster hunter Van Helsing, son of the more famous Helsing that you're thinking of. Haunting his side is the impolite and begrudgingly helpful ghost Katarina, who takes on a variety of roles depending on your pre-made script for her. Taking place immediately after the events of the first game, Van Helsing finds no rest as he is instantly thrust into a new conflict that has arisen from the wreckage he left upon solving the last one.\n\nThere's something lost in the adventure by continuing the story so soon after the first game, and keeping you locked into the land of Borgovia. The first installment generated a lot of adventure and captured imagination of the player as they continuously unlocked more secrets about the odd monster hub of Borgovia. The player would move across the country side, rescuing small villages and delving into secret ruins and all-around truly capturing the feel of being a Van Helsing. This game, however, locks you back into Borgovia, with very little left to explore. Van Helsing is now well versed in the country's conflicts and legends, leaving only a few snippets of secrets to discover on his path. Also gone are the days of basic monster hunting, and instead he is charged with leading a resistance against a mechanical and undead army, none of which really feels like something that fits in with Van Helsing (they were featured in the first game, but not to this degree).\n\nThe variety of monsters you face feels limited, though it could only be deceptively so. It's hard to tell as any monster design is usually lost in the pulled back camera, environments blending in with the colors of the monsters, and the sheer mass of baddies that will swarm you. I feel bad for whomever designed the creatures, putting time and effort into creating each and every unique monster, only to have 90% of their design lost in the crowds. There are unique enemies, much like in Diablo, but unlike Diablo they are few and far between, with no real randomness to their set up. For the most part you'll just dredge through wave after wave of swarming enemies, only able to pick out your allies in the crowd by the color of their health bar.\n\nMusically the game falls flat. The title score perfectly matches the backdrop of the time period (fictional though it may be), but you'll be hearing that and not much else for the entire game. Your attacks have adequete sounds to follow their barrage, but the enemies will pretty much just roar and snarl, if anything. Voice acting is average to below average in some cases. The actors read their lines, do the inflections as best they can, but there's no passion or thought behind the efforts.\n\nJust like the first game, the gameplay is heavily inspired by Diablo, where you move by clicking on an area or just holding down the mouse button and aiming your hunter, and attacking is also controlled by the mouse buttons and the 1-6 keys, so you wont really be mixing movement and attacks at the same time, though it's highly recommended you learn to not stay in one place for too long unless you're really good at slowing enemies down.\n\nTo help you in your quest you have skills, auras, and tricks. Skills are acquired through the skill tree, the points for which are gained with every level. At first they're cheap, needing only one point to upgrade, but soon they raise the price to two points per upgrade and then three. This is done so you don't get more powerful abilities as quickly as the lower level ones, but as a result progression through your tree feels very slow, especially as you debate whether or not you should upgrade an existing skill, either through a passive effect or one of three bonus effects that you can toggle in the field. To its credit, this game does well with an individual skill, tossing aside the notion that it's all just upgrade the skill in a lateral fashion, and instead allowing you to further customize how you want your skill to operate, but much like the costs of skills this also serves to slow down progression through the tree. You can argue if this is good or bad, objectively, but to the player it feels dull. Auras are passive upgrades and tricks are mana-less abilities usually reserved for when situations get tough. Both auras and tricks are upgraded with skill points as well, though, further slowing down tree progression and either resulting in you having a few of each, or a lot of skills and virtually none of the other two.\n\nComing over from the DLC of the first game, Helsing II allows you to choose between three classes instead of one: hunter, engineer, and mage (the exact names I don't remember or care to look up). Hunters can use guns or swords and swap between either on the fly (though you'll most likely only stick with one as they don't share a skill tree but they have to share points - further progression slowing). Engineers attack more slowly and deliberately as well as summon turrets and mechanized spiders to help out. Mages do what mages do best: magic. All three can dabble in different elements (fire, ice, poison, and lightning), so they all feel very similiar in their effects even though their executions can be different.\n\nThe game would had been better served with just the original class, much how the vanilla version of the first game came. This allowed for a very varied class, offering lots of avenues to explore for your hunter. Now, all three feel slightly more limited compared to the original design of the previous game.\n\nGear comes much like in diablo, in different rarities with a lot of different stats to consider. You can enchant gear, there are set bonuses, the usual fare you come to expect from an action RPG. The large variety of stats that can be on a piece of gear allows for gear progression to be less linear than most games, which can be overwhelming but it does make for a richer experience.\n\nTower defense is back, but you can completely skip over it if you want; while fun, it's understandable if you do skip it after the first or second try, as it can get tedious. Along with tower defense you have unique npcs you can send out on missions along with soliders you pay to train and equip, and a beastie that can also go out on missions and collect loot and gold for you. It's a concept that has been done before, but honestly it's not one I'm a fan of. You are given these quests that sound interesting, and then are told that you are not allowed to go - you have to send an npc on the mission and you don't see how they progress, just if they succeeded or not. It's incredibly hollow and I saw no point in its inclusion at all.\n\nOverall, the game plays much like the first game, but what content was there has been watered down by the inclusion of new, often shallow, content and all of it is spread too thin on a surprsingly short game. There is three chapters to the game, each relatively short and the story of the game just...ends. You can see it coming rather easily, but you're still interested in what will come of the predictable development, but they don't give you the satisfaction. The cliff hanger of this caliber is almost insulting, flaunting the idea of a sequel or future DLC so blatantly you get the feeling that they just didn't feel like giving you a real story when they could chop it up and serve it to you over a longer period of time, hoping you are willing to pay up each time you get another chunk.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun action RPG, you'd be better suited with the first Van Helsing, or better yet Torchlight I/II.\n\n","July 6, 2014","false","11.8"," 42 of 71 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","42","71","0","1"

The areas with nature are drastically reduced and everything is more in steam-punk style. There are also some changes in "tower defense minigame" and extras like rune-crafting and army building.

Diablo I, Diablo 2, Path of Exile.\nThese are the heavy-hitting ARPGs I stack everything up to.\n\nDiablo I had atmosphere and a pacing you cannot find in any other game. The slow deliberation as you traveled through the dungeon has not been duplicate to this day.\n\nDiablo II had a flexible skill tree that entices players to construct a build for each and every skill. I'm not sure why, but those skills had real character.\n\nPath of Exile. My newest love has been especially revolutionary in their currency and item modding systems. The challenge of POE drew my attention. Graphically, the game is terribly bland.\n\nThe Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing II\n\nAtmostphere: This game has a great atmosphere. Turning dark and gloomy areas into interesting scene pieces without the boredom like in POE or the ADHD tones of Torchlight II. There's a story that guides you along without being overbearing.\n\nSound: The voice acting is nice. The banter between Helsing and Katarina is frequent and entertaining. There is some bad voice acting for other NPCs. The spell and combat sounds could use work.\n\nSystems: While the game is not revolutionary in its currency system, it has a good amount of gold sinks. Shopping, to respecing, enchanting, item modding, gambling: these are just some of the ways to spend your gold.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay is pretty standard fair for ARPGs. However there is a slight targeting issue and some environmental boundaries that you might get hung up on. The maps are not procedurally generated, but they are handcrafted nicely.\n\nCustomization: There is quite a bit of customization across the character classes. They advertise over 200 spells. They all seem quite varied and to add another layer of depth, they all can be modded further by the use of the rage system. By activating one or more of the rage buttons, it modifies the ability to perform differently. Similar to the rune system from Diablo III, albeit not as grand, almost all abilities have 3 mods. They usually come in the form of an extra projectile, more damage, % life gain on kill, first second of channeling stuns all targets, etc.\n\nDifficulty: I heard this game on max difficult was impossible. 4 hours into my second Hunter (lvl 9), I am encountering mobs that are similar to merciless difficulty mobs in Path of Exile. It is not until around this level have I fought my first REAL rare mob. These ice witches that I am fighting, all have a slow aura........ which stacks. In a two stack of these witches, my melee hunter was moving at around 20% movement speed.\n\nThe problem with having extremely difficult monsters in these type of games, is that it forces players to kite. I still find the courage to fight in melee range. But when I'm playing hardcore against 4 Path of Exile charging Brutus', I still end up running at the end of the day.\n\nThere's something for every theorycrafter. Whether you're trying to create game breaking builds or make a subpar gimmick skill work, the game is extremely fun.","May 24, 2014","true","146.4"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

But the gameplay itself is solid, the class and talent system is complex enough to validate multiple playthroughs, and offers randomized scenarios after finishing the story, which is about 8-10 hours long.","September 1, 2014","true","10.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Its more of "The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing Episode 2", rather than a second seperate game. The story line picks up right were the first game ends and you should ideally import your character from the first game. There is a whole second tier of abilities added onto the first set thats in the first game, and if you don't import a level 30 character, you won't be able to get those abilities (unless you play with one of  the level-30s they already have available. There are a few more things they've added in from the first game, such as squad commanders located in the lair that you can send out on missions, kind of like the missions you send you assassins out on in AC: Brotherhood. They also improved the lair-defense mini-game so its  a lot more fun....and if you don't want to play the defense game, you can send your resistance squads to do it for you. One final thing that makes this game so awesome is all the funny little pop culture references...one of the early missions is "Saving Private Bryan", who is totally useless except for the fact that the commanders like the cakes he makes...and when you go into a cave, Katerina says "We can't stop here, this is bat country". Also, there's Don Quixote's lance, some plans from Da Vinci that give you a permanent stat boost, and you find Gandalf's body with a sword and staff on it...Van Helsing and Katerina make fun of him for trying to be a wizard and a fighter.

Not in "old school" kind of way, just outdated. It's like playing some mediocre game from the mid-2000s, whose name you won't even remember afterwards. You'll feel it in the UI, graphics, sound effects and voice acting, gameplay mechanics, everything.\n\nWhile the setting seems intriguing, the story is at best generic. I didn't play the first part, and i couldn't quite understand what's going on and why should i care. Who is this Katarina chick and why is she helping Van Helsing? Why is general Harker a "bad guy" if all he wants is to clean the streets from monsters and bandits? What's up with this Resistance? Who are they resisting, exactly? Why the scientists are suddenly villains? Why half of the people here have slavic names and the other half don't? Where are all the vampires and why is one of them Van Helsing's ally? I really had no time and/or desire to figure all of this out. Seriously, even Torchlight had a better story, at least it was simple and self-explanatory.\n\nTo make things worse, the game has its share of bugs, too. And the co-op mode, which is the only one i'd ever want to play in this case, is currently a laggy mess.\n\nOverall, the game's not horrible, and it probably has its moments in the later stages, but to me it's just not worth it. I'd rather pick any alternative action-RPG (i.e. Diablo 3, PoE, Grim Dawn, Torchlight 2...) than this one.\n\nP.S.

Yes, yes it is, but it's definitely not "great". I still recommend it. Here's why:\n\nPros:\n\n- Engaging story and characters (for an action RPG) with enough humour and charme to keep you entertained\n- Interesting setting (It's a mixture of the industrial revolution with magic and monster hunters), with interesting enemy design etc.\n- Gameplay is good enough\n- Diverse skill tree\n- Lots of items\n- 3 distinct classes (I think the other classes were in VH 1 as DLC). The traditional hunter, a flamethrower type guy with advanced weapons and a mage\n- 4 difficulty settings\n- Ability to import chars from VH 1 or create an "expert char" at lvl 30\n- "Endless mode" apparently\n- Low price point\n- Base of operations\n\nCons:\n- The campaign is pretty short. I've beaten it on "Casual", because I'm not that interested in spending 20+ hours on this, in about 9 hours with every map fully explored. The story picks right off after Fulmigatis death from VH 1. This time you are up against General Harker, who takes over where the other villain died...well, eh. It's definitely necessary to view the VH series as a 3 episode game, because that's what it is. You're pretty lost without having played VH 1.\n- The story has 2 major problems:  1. The main villain, General Harker, is seen only at the very end of the game and has not even 1 line of text in the entire game. What kind of villain. Wow...boring as hell. 2. It's obvious from the very beginning that Prisoner 7 is going to betray you and become the next villain...very predictable. Also, there is generally a lot less "lore" in the game than in VH 1..\n- The setting is still cool, but there is little new to it. I think a snowy peak and a spider level are the only new settings being used. The rest is typical wilderness and city...disappointed.\n- The gameplay isn't bad, but it's also not entertaining for long, unlike say Diablo 3, where you have several active abilities and augmentations that can be switched around for lots of combinations. Here you basically get a limited amount of skill points to use 6 active skills (of which I only used the heal for the hunter, because honestly, weapon skills seemed more important) and also, theoretically, 8 weapon skills (4 melee and 4 ranged). I say theoretically, because you can only unlock so many skills that seem useful in 1 playthrough, because you also have to level them up 10 times to get the ultimate augmentation for it and to improve its damage. Since I barely made it to level 28 in my first playthrough, I didn't have a lot of diverse skills, because, frankly, there are just so many of them and so many seem redundant. You can't just pick up a new skill and try it out, because it might be completely useless without the augmentations or without levelling it up, which makes the system rather pointless in my opinion. Again, Diablo 3 for example does a much better job of just giving you skills to play around with, without forcing you to invest loads of skill points that you can only get back through a respec which costs a lot of money.)\n- The crafting system: It's frankly very boring and apparently you cannot use the rune system until level 30, because items below that level can't be disenchanted for materials you need for runecrafting...that is seriously ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- There are lots of items. Unfortunately, maybe 5% of the items that dropped were actually useful to me, which makes the experience rather dull...for example, if your campaign is only 8-9 hours long and your players have to use the same weapon for 3 hours then you failed in making the loot system interesting...also dropping loot that a player can't even use, because he is level 10 and you drop a level 38 sword is supremely dickish...I still have that sword in my stash.\n- The game is imho not unique or interesting enough to play through again...so that is also a problem. There is no longevity.\n- Even on the lowest difficulty setting you can get killed very easily, repeatedly, which is also kind of frustrating, for example when you are facing 3 mighty enemies and can barely pierce their shields, but get instagibbed by their non avoidable ranged attack, that is bad game design. I don't mind a challenge, but the hordes Van Helsing throws at you are ridiculous at times.\n- The "base" gets annoying pretty quickly, because you get radioed frequently to return to base and complete some mission or whatever. Thankfully you do not have to do that...at all I think, dunno, you can also let your soldiers do the missions, but it interrupts the game flow pretty annoyingly and constantly.\n- Money does not seem to be an issue in this game and I have no idea what to even spend it on...save for resurrects.\n- The sound clipping is STILL present and is extremely annoying. Try a char who doesn't shoot with guns...*sigh*\n\nAll in all Van Helsing 2 does not improve in any way upon Van Helsing 1. The only new addition I can think of is the base and that's really a minor feature. The story is less engaging, the novelty has worn off. There are still funny moments, but they are less interesting in general. It feels rushed out and as I said like episode 2 of the same game, which it apparently is, since now we have Van Helsing 3, which I will be testing now, and which probably doesn't have any changes in it either. It's a bit sad, because I think you could really expand upon the game's crazy setting, but eh...maybe 3 is better.\n\nWhy do I still recommend it? Because it's a solid enough ARPG for almost no cost...it's cheaper than most games are even when heavily discounted. And for that it's good enough and entertaining for a short amount of time, especially if you want to continue your save from VH 1 (which I didn't have anymore, because not Steam and uninstalled, blah).","May 25, 2015","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/272470/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","Quick Summary – This is a direct continuation of the first game The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing (VH1), beginning immediately after the final boss battle of that game.  The gameplay is identical, and in fact you can import your VH1 character to play through the VH2 campaign. The same three character classes appear: Hunter, Thaumaturge, and Arcane Mechanic (the second 2 were DLC characters in VH1) and the character skills are basically the same up until around level 30. In VH2 there are more “end game” things to keep you playing after you’ve beaten the main story. If you enjoyed part 1 you should like part 2.\n\nYou play the title character Van Helsing, a monster hunter attempting to clear the cursed land of Borgova with your trusty (and sassy) ghost sidekick Lady Katarina. In the first game, you defeated an evil mad scientist and his clockwork monster army, but now a new hardass general has arrived to take up the evil reins. Once again, you and Katarina must work with the Borgova Resistance to destroy an army of abominations as well as face the various wild creatures of this tainted country.\n\nThe Van Helsing games are steampunk third person isometric hack / slash RPGs like the Diablo or Torchlight series, so if you’ve played one of those you should have a good idea what you’re in for (swords, sorcery, loot). Gameplay-wise your pal Katarina is like a mercenary in Diablo 2 or a pet in Torchlight. She has her own equipment/stats/skill trees though, so you’ll need to spend some time making sure her build is up to par. As you’d expect, there is an extensive randomized “loot” system where you can find magical/rare/epic equipment to outfit your hero (a lot of equipment is class specific but you can twink items between characters using a shared stash). If you search online you can hear rumors of “godlike” gear, though it’s so rare that 99% of players will probably never even see one.\n\nIn the first Van Helsing, the game was mostly over after you beat the last boss. The level cap was 30, and there wasn’t much to do after you finish except run “scenarios” which were hard bonus maps with upgraded loot. Bear in mind that in both Van Helsing games the main campaign maps are not randomized. Once you’ve played through the game you’ll know exactly where everything is. In VH2, there is a “veteran mode” which is a higher level playthrough of the same campaign (like True Vault Hunter in Borderlands, or Nightmare mode in Diablo) where the enemies are stronger and the loot is noticeably better. Additionally, the level cap is 60 and there are a bunch of new skills that weren’t in the first game. Oddly enough, you can adjust the game difficulty in veteran mode without penalty (higher level but easy mode!).\n\nPros:\n+Nice graphics for an indie game. The story is decent (though it feels kind of short) and there are a huge number of pop culture references and pokes at other games. This is a logical continuation of the fun Van Helsing 1 game, leading directly to the third game and forming a cohesive storyline.\n+There is a co-op multiplayer option though I wasn’t able to find anyone to play with immediately. Campaigns are always more fun when you go through them with a partner.\n+If you liked the tower defense mission in the first game, there are a lot more in Van Helsing 2 though they’re basically optional quests. So if you hate Tower Defense just delegate the missions to your underlings.\n\nCons:\n-My research shows a lot of complaints about the cooperative campaign “breaking” and stranding people’s characters unable to advance. I’ve experienced it once myself despite reports that the bug has been fixed. Multiplayer search is also pretty dead, you need to set up games with your friends and not rely on built in matchmaking. Alas a bunch of the Steam achievements are for multiplayer PVP \n-There is not all that much info online about this game. It’s hard to find comprehensive help on achievements / skill builds, probably due to the game’s indie nature. The game’s developer has basically moved on to Van Helsing 3 and won’t be doing much more for this game. You can play through the entire game and not understand a number of the “important” aspects. For example I didn’t even know what runecrafting / essences / trophies were or how they worked without researching online. They’re not even mentioned in the game’s tutorials.\n-One thing to note if you’re importing a character from Van Helsing 1. Your Katarina will be significantly weaker than if you play through VH2 on normal and then switch to Veteran mode. This may be a bug, but it’s really annoying if you’re trying to build an “ultimate character.”\n\nOverall I enjoyed this game, and if you liked Diablo, Torchlight, or Path of Exile you probably will too. Don’t expect it to be “better” than the first game though, it’s more like a second episode in the campaign. Going through single player takes about 12 hours to finish on normal mode, but if you don’t play through veteran mode (up to level 60), you’ll be missing out on literally half the skills/equipment.\n","November 6, 2015","true","43.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With Van Helsing's fresh and numerous, unique additions though, I believe this to be a requisite title for any ARPG fan.\n\n\nIt's not that I disagree with all of your assessments, but pretty much all ARPG's have problems with items #1-3 throughout in some form or another.\n\nI usually play a melee character, and other games usually treat melee badly (vanilla Diablo 3 comes to mind, at least compared to my experience with Barbarian vs Witch Doctor).  I was pleased to have a pleasant experience in Van Helsing 2 using a melee character.  I can't speak to mage balance because I balanced my DPS with plenty of defense/resist as a melee theme (no mana shield though).  I would sometimes get gibbed pretty quick, but I would usually see that there was dangerous stuff I didn't move out of (kinda my bad).  Plus, this game has a perk that lets you get a "free life" every 3 minutes where you turn into a ghost on the spot so that little mess-ups aren't such a big deal.  There's a trick that lets you vanish from all aggro as well.\n\nTo touch on difficulty:  I played the game on Hard, but you can change it on the fly (which is nice) and you can get these unique trophies that modify the difficulty of the game in very specific tradeoff style ways (if you so choose).  My favorite was a trophy that gave +100 magic find, but mobs have 20% more HP.\n\nVan Helsing's storyline #3 is waaay better than almost all other ARPG in my opinion.  The quests, dialogue/voice acting, and story progression are probably only matched by Diablo 3 in quality.  Torchlight, Path of Exile, and other ARPGs barely have a useful story aside from framing mob slaughter.  It's not as good as every other game I've played, but it's top notch for ARPGs.  I see this as a highly subjective evaluation though, so I'm not as adamant about this as the other items.\n\nEndgame for #4 I can't speak to, because I usually just play through games once usually.  I haven't tried multiplayer #5, but I can see that would be a frustrating experience.\n\nIn my experience with the hunter on hard for one play-through (no multiplayer), I would definitely recommend it.  I see that you had problems with the mage and maybe the gibbing gave a bad taste in your mouth playing at heroic difficulty.  When comparing it to other ARPGs, it's hard for me to see how a fan of the genre wouldn't enjoy experiencing Van Helsing and thus recommend others to "give it a go."   I really thought the unique elements of this game were refreshing and want to see a third one.\n\n\nList of other awesome stuff I love about this game is below.  I'll add more later whenever they come to mind as I'm playing the "Ink Hunt" DLC and replay the game using an Arcane mechanic.\n\nWASD movement option:  I don't use WASD all the time to move and attack, but it helps tremendously when kiting and in place of a "move here" hotkey.  By the way, they need to add a "move here" key, I was looking for it when I saw I could configure WASD (they currently have it defaulted as the up, down, left, and right keys.  You can also do another advanced move where you can use your mouse for things on menus (character/inventory, etc) while at the same time moving around precisely (where normally if you want to move, you HAVE to have clicked with your mouse on something).  Although I wish there was an option to make make the base keys move diagonally.  W should move the character up and to the right, the S key should make the character down and to the left, etc.  This is because most paths in top down isometric ARPGs like this usually have main paths pointing diagonally.  This default diagonal movement keeps the player from more often having to hold down more than one WASD key.\n\nThe many cute easter-egg moments (this is just ONE example):  In the "Ink Hunt" DLC I just saw two goblins in a Titanic-esque pose fall off the front of a boat in the air, embracing each other throughout their death fall.  Sadly, I was so stunned I didn't take a screenshot   :(\n\nVery easy to compare gear quickly:  When comparing gear, by using a special option in the menu, you can see two different gear comparisons.  One comparison of base stat changes, and one comparison with all enchantments together.  This way, you don't always think, "Wow I rarely get a decent upgrade!"  When, in fact, you've been comparing the gear using the enchantment and infused essences together in most games.\n\nInteresting Boss Fights:  The bosses usually have some kind of special addition that I haven't seen.  Like in the Ink Hunt DLC, this boss shoots a fire beam out in an arc as one move, slams down from above with another move, and draws you in with a third move.  This is just one example, but at least the bosses aren't, "They just take longer to kill" (although they do take longer to kill).  Luckily there is also an aura that dramatically increases your proficiency (by 25%) when taking on elite mobs.\n\nRewarded for paying attention to positioning: For instance, there are some mobs that have wind up attacks in front of them that can easily be avoided using direction WASD.  Other mobs will have a front facing shield (some of the mobs literally have a tower shield with a peeking window) that you must get behind to score more damage.  Other mobs will visually look heavily armored in the front, and you must move behind them and they turn slowly.  And I know what you're thinking, "That'd be annoying to tell if the mob just has a buncha armor up front, that's a subtle tell..."  and you're right!  That's why they also add the front-damaging-reducing quality to the mobs description bar as well so that there's no confusion.  I like how the game rewards me for paying attention to positioning and taking full advantage of WASD + point-n-click synergy.","June 26, 2014","true","35.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I didn't. It feels like one of those kid movie sequels where the first movie was unique and the second movie is a sad reiteration. Though the cobat in this game can be fun at times & the characters have an interesting dystopic steam punk flair, the user interface is fatally broken.\n\nBasic locamotion is a struggle at times with many of the landscape features like short bushes hampering what should be a relatively smooth process. Mere movement shouldn't engender such frustration in my books.\n\nNone of the user-interface mechanics are self-evident or even remotely simple to figure out. There seems to be a flawed breakdown in the translation to "full controller support." One prime example would be the "hall of remembrance" mechanics (which for those of you who might not know is a 'castle defence' type of mini game with a challenging series of defence battles) Well, the masterminds behind this game have allocated the same key to "start all over again at the beginning" that you use as your main attack. So you'll  be clicking frantically fighting off wave after wave of mobs & then when you finally finish your reward (if you accidentally hit attack again even once) is to have to start all over again. This could have been easily remedied with a confirmation window asking if you did indeed want to start all over & lose all of your hardwon progress (confirmations are not a new concept in the game world... usually a standard thing to keep gamers from wanting to tear their hair out and uninstall your game). Granted you can set your own key-bindings for attack skills but let's be honest, X is standard for attack and there are only so many buttons on a controller. Not that you'd need that many with this sequel, to be honest. I was very surprised at how downgraded the skill tree was from the first game. Some things are the same (though you might not want them to be) ... almost all of the NPCs say the exact same thing as they did in one. (Like the enchantress) who says "you seem tired" (funny that's exactly what i'm thinking about the NPC dialogue, tired.\n\nA confirmation window would also fix the problems with the vendors. It is very easy to accidentally sell some great piece of gear with no buyback option as well. Or accidentally waste your money buying gear you never meant to purchase. And don't even get me started on the mess they've made of the inventory system which was just great in the first game. (I would have to cuss). ;)\n\nFurthermore, this sequel seems to be plagued with many of the same basic running flaws as the first game. I was so excited to get an especially great enchant, only to have the game crash & not save it. My rig is exceptionally good (custom built for gaming) so i know the crashing is not because of my set up.\n\nIt's more than a bit of a heartbreak that a game with such potential (and such lootastically instant gratification via pillaging) is so .... well, broken. It makes me wish i worked in the industry so i could fix it up. It could have been legendary.","September 25, 2014","false","22.0"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","14","29","0","0"

Meaning that the game was shipped with the same problems as the first one: Boring storyline, shortness of quests and game lenght, not enough customization options for your equipment. Worst part is that the game got released so soon after the first that it is pretty much the same game, but with a few more quests, a new villain, more levels and skills to go with it.\n\nKeep in mind that these are not big problems at all. Gameplay itself is pretty fun, difficulty is amazing and I fell in love with the freedom you have to play on the hardest settings since the very first moment, unlike most ARPGs that will make you play through the game up to four times before having a real challenge. I've managed to finish the game on Heroic without breaking much sweat with a solid build, made by myself. That's a lot. Usually, a game won't let you experiment on builds and still allow you to progress. Either you follow the mainstream builds or you're done for. So, if you really like ARPGs and want to go even further than that, you'll have a pretty nice challenge with Veteran. ♥♥♥♥'s unforgiving.\n\nHaving the option to use your character from the first game is also great. Played both games with the same character on Heroic and had a blast from start to finish. Some forty hours of gameplay overall. Graphics are good enough, experienced some crashes if I aggro too many enemies and atack them all at the same time with AoE, but that may be my hardware, and not the game.\n\nThe reason I'll tell you not to buy and play this game is simply that it came out too soon, it looks exactly the same as the first one. It's a obvious rushed sequel to enjoy the money made from the success of the first game. By the looks of the ending of the second game, there's a third coming out. I just hope it's not the same thing all over again. If you want to play a fun, new game, play the first Van Helsing. This one is just a copy paste.\n\nQuick update (06/04/15): Yep, turns out there was a third game coming out and it is still exactly the same copy paste. My point remains: Get the first one and you'll have seen enough of all three games.\n\nGameplay - 7/10\nSoundtrack - 6/10\nGraphics - 6/10\nContent - 5/10\nChallenge Level - 8/10\nReplayability - 3/10","January 5, 2015","false","20.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","1"

I also don't care about multiplayer elements, so that's not a detraction either.\n\nThe story seems like a pretty good idea hastily thrown together.  Many plot elements have zero explanation, they simply "are".  There are loads of pop-culture references which border on fourth-wall breaking, and spice things up a little.  At many points there are FMV cutscenes between you and Katarina where you must make decisions on some things, such as doing something a certain way, removing armor from an altar, searching a body, etc.  These decisions never have a bearing on larger things, but it adds some appreciated variety.  The dialogue has hit or miss voice acting, but the game is definitely interesting enough.\n\nI made four different characters and constantly ran into the same problem over and over again.  Everything chugs along peachy-keen until you get your face put in the dirt and you're f***** right in the a**.  This is not a particular boss fight (as far as I had gotten anyway), it's always some innocuous-seeming group of mobs - too many mobs - that do it.\n\nThe problem with this formula is that this is a completely linear ARPG.  There is no grinding for gear, or experience, or stats.  Reskilling is easy enough if you haven't spent too much money, but after awhile you get this creeping suspicion that the difficulty spikes are complete bull****, meant to breathe life into what is otherwise a tactically uninteresting game.\n\nOther people complain about the tower-defense elements, or the commander aspect where you send subordinates on missions.  While these things don't bother me, I do ask - why?  The game has only one ending, and these things have no bearing, but these are far more involved than sidequests, so why are they there?\n\nThe skill trees are massive.  There are far too many abilities, and far too few points.  The progressive-skill design is complete nonsense.  Abilities not even remotely related to one another will be required to learn other abilities you may want.  It wouldn't be so bad to waste skill points like this, but like I said - no grinding.\n\nMy biggest gripe however is the GUI.  The game has controller support which in my opinion dumbs down the interface by sheer necessity, and in my opinion cripples the game.  You essentially have 6 hotkeys, and both mouse buttons.  The function keys can swap certain abilities on the mouse buttons, but even though skills might be able to be bound, depending on what type of skill it is it MAY NOT BE USABLE ON THAT PARTICULAR BUTTON.  This means that certain skills can only be left or right mouse-bound, even though the game says otherwise.  Any particular class has literally dozens of skills, but using any more than 8 is punishing because of the occasional need to kite.  It all feels much clunkier than it should have been.\n\nSo, essentially, the game would need massive retro-fitting to be a good LINEAR ARPG.  It simply breaks too many rules of good design with its self-imposed limitations to be enjoyable for very long, especially with the reality of games like Torchlight and Divinity: Original Sin.  Perseverance should be required for games like this as a matter of intelligence or discipline, not simply fighting the game's awkward systems.","October 1, 2015","false","18.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

After struggling for a few minutes, updating my GPU drivers, and rebooting the machine I tried again with the same results.\n\nChecking through the forums found that people have been complaining about this since launch last year. Turns out, the solution is to unplug any game controllers before launching the game.\n\nWhy these developers think it’s okay to force gamers to alter their hardware because they’re too lazy to put an if block into their code is beyond me.\n\nLazy programmers get no points from me, and certainly won't be getting any more of my money.\n\n0/10.\nDon't waste your time.\n","June 26, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The story is bland and uninteresting, involving a villain that we never see with motives that are never explained. It was nice to be able to play as the DLC characters free of charge, and the compelling stat growth from the first is maintained admirably, as are the creative enemy types. Unfortunately, the game feels like an add-on to the first in terms of quality and content. Graphics are exactly the same, and the scenery is almost entirely boring dead-tech metal, lacking the colorful forested areas from the original.\n\nThe game also spends too much time on pointless, distracting minigames. One of these, a simple tower-defense, is fun, but I paid for an ARPG, not a tower-defense game. Another involves sending minions out on specific missions depending on their individual strengths and weaknesses. I hope the developers didn't spend to much time on this aspect, because it is utterly, 100% pointless.\n\nLastly: I was unable to beat the game. This is a huge taboo for me as a critic. The difficulty spikes ten-fold during the Drill battle, as the game throws endlessly spawning OP enemies at you as you run around flipping the same switches over and over. It's tedious and unfair, and my requests for help on the forums were met with disdain of the "get gud" variety.\n\nAt least the menu music is pretty.","September 17, 2015","false","25.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","2"

A few weeks ago my son and I got bored with playing Reaper of Souls on Xbox One, and we were in the market for another ARPG of similar quality. We tried Crimson Alliance on the 360 and got bored with it fairly quickly.\n\nAnd then, WOOOSH: we discovered the first installment of The Incredible Adventures of "Maester Van Helsing"! We were so excited that I took a day off to rebuild an older PC into a dedicated machine for my living room. Years ago I brushed off Steam as a failed experiment; but Van Helsing made me come back to it, and build my own Big Picture Steam Machine! Sure, the game's UI could use a bigger text size for those of us who like playing on sixty inch monitors from twenty feet away, but that's the only fault I found with the game (perhaps in Neocore's native Hungary big screen TVs have not been invented yet). Overall, the first Van Helsing game was a delight, and we put some fifty hours into it!\n\nNaturally, we wanted to continue the adventure and bought Van Helsing Two. Not just game number two, but two licenses as well since we were dying to try multiplayer.\n\nNow I wish I could put this nicely, but what en effing dissapointment!\n\nVan Helsing Two is a Piece of Crap.\n\nAfter being released roughly one year ago, it suffers from tens, if not hundreds of bugs. It is slow. Multiplayer sucks (it fails to update one player's screen correctly, randomly disconnects, etc). The added complexity of the Command Center minigame adds unnecessary confussion and bugs (you have invisible characters that will speak to you although they are away on a mission). The game crashes when you add essences to yout equipment.\n\nI could go on and on and on, and while I found the concepts, graphics and overall atmosphere of Borgovia enticing I cannot really recommend the game to anyone. The execution was obviously left to twenty year old incompetent programmers. And to be clear: when I say the game is slow, I mean that compared to playing the first game on the exact same 3.4 GHz AMD dual core machine that plays Van Helsing One without breaking a sweat.\n\nJudging by the rate at which Neocore launches new DLC and new games (Van Helsing Three is about to be released this year, and in between they made Deathtrap, a spinoff from the  Van Helsing series capitalizing on the Ink) they are more interested in taking our dollars than fixing the bugs in their existing games.\n\nOverall the game feels like a rough, unfinished BETA. Save your time and money and play something else -- even the early access version of Victor Vran is a better investment.","April 5, 2015","false","48.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It's basically more of the same with solid gameplay, but a little less comedy and wit this time around. There are a number of optional tower defense side quests to break up the pace of the game a bit. I recommend playing this on a higher difficulty, I found the game to be very easy even on Heroic. At max level you have the option to either run Scenarios or Neverending Story like VH1. The scenario setup is different the the first game and rewards the player with stacking bonuses for complete a series of 6 scenarios. They also added in a few new twists like the Chimaera and improved skill trees and functionalities for Katrina.

There are massive pixelized blobs where\ncharacters stand, right from the very first scene. Rolling back to DX10 fixed this.\n\nEvery time I start the game I get pop ups from Microsoft and Steam recognizing it as\nthe first time I'm launching the game. Not a biggie. I just question why this happens.\n\nMobs of monsters that pull you toward them, surround you and kill you when you can't\ndo anything about it is not fun. As is elite type mobs who will one shot you the moment\nthey see you. This for me is a big design flaw. No matter what armor/weapons/skills you have,\nI have found these situation completely unavoidable...and too frequent.\nThis is my main peeve for VH2. Balance is so erratic. To be fighting hordes succesfully only\nto be one shotted by a creature that barely enters the screen is just not right.\n\nDespite my downside problems with the game it has such promise.\n\nThe addition of a Chimera pet was nice to see. You can send it on private missions and\nit will bring back items for you. You can even call on this pet to help you in your own\nbattles, although it doesn't really seem to do anything but stay to the rear and tends\nnot to help me. Perhaps further down the line it will start helping more.\n\nThe defense mini games where you send commanders out into the field isn't what I\nexpected in this game. They're quite fun but did take a while for me to get into.\nThey build up some decent XP which is always nice.\n\nKatarina's wisecracks have been given a shot in the arm. She's much more vocal this time around.\nHer comments are always a treat to hear. The numerous pop culture references are, IMO, one of\nthe highlights of the game.  The "Private Bryan" quest I'll be remembering for quite some\ntime...genius.\n\nJust like the first game it's beautiful to look at. Creatures and mechanical beasts are very well\ndrawn and animated. Frame rate for me suffers a bit when the screen is overloaded but It's\nstill playable. I found I depend a lot on Katarina when this happens.\n\nDo I like it enough to recommend it? Yes. The story is a good one (but VH1's was a tad better).\nThe flaws tend to frustrate me but I'm trying to overlook them. This is a fine game but, for me,\n1 was a much better game.\n\nWith all its flaws I do enjoy playing. I'm not sure if it's to finish the game or to find out\nwhat Katarina is going to say next!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","16.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Endgame grind isn't steep, especially for certain builds, but at least that's what you can do now and by yourself, not after hundreds of hours and with prayers to RNGesus.\nScenarios for now are pretty limited, not that much room for replayability as some other RPGs provide. But there could be updates, there is still Tower Defense mode, there are missions for your captains - things NeoCore can polish and introduce later.\nThey have already done magnificent job with part two, which looks like a really sophisticated version of the original, and just after a year. I have my hopes that they will keep evolving their new franchise.\nIt's not a brilliant game, but it's much better than D3 at the point of release, and it's not much behind TL2 in terms of gameplay. But it's much cheaper and more unique than either of them, so if you want something fancy from an ARPG - go for it.","July 27, 2014","true","71.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Van Helsing offers a huge skilltree, lots of item collecting, customization and crafting fun. The gameplay is more relaxed and linear than other rpgs, you dont have 100 simultaneous quests but maybe 3-4, and you dont have 5 chars to take care of but only your main char and Katherina a helpful ghost with its own skills.\nThe campaign itself is a bit short (maybe 30 hours) but the replay values is very high, since you only reach ~lvl30 after the first playthrough and about half of the skilltree only comes after lvl30.  I really liked that you have a lair (your "home") where you return after the battles to upgrade your stuff, manage your restistance group by sending out troops, a bit like in dragon age. The tower defense minigame is so amazing, you will definitely want to buy Deathtrap, the full game that they made out of it.\nThere are a few bugs and balancing issues, but no dealbreakers.\nMultiplayer is unfortunately deserted, at least when I tried (1 year after release) there seems to be no one playing :(","March 17, 2015","true","23.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If so, buy it!\n\nMore seriously - It's part 2 of the trilogy, continuing the story from the first game.\nAs an ARPG, brilliant, 3 classes, and loads of ways to build your character.\nMusical score is outstanding, graphics are up to date (Better than path of exile by leaps, can't compare to D3 as haven't played), story i'll reserve judgement on until the trilogy is complete. Your sidekick AI Katarina is outstanding (as a character) and the back-and-forth between the characters is enjoyable to listen to.\n\nIts what a sequel should be - continuing the story of the first one while improving upon it. The combat has been streamlined (as in control is easier, more fluid and natural whereas it is a bit stiff in Van helsing 1 when managing multiple spells and rage points).\n\nThe downside is bugs - they are there and some people have issues with crashing; however this hasn't been a serious problem for both me and my partner after spending well over 100 hours cooping the game (gradually reaching the 100 hour mark per game). Also the devs are very active in the forums and pretty snappy at responding to peoples issues most of the time.\n\nGame is longer than the first one and considerably more in depth lair now, "end game" arguably needs work, however its an ARPG endgame generally consists of replaying and gear grinding, gear grinding is facillitated through nightmare scenarios and neverending story.\n\nIf you like ARPGs and haven't played either, give the first a go but bearing in mind the second is considerably improved. If you enjoyed the first and are holding off for some reason - stop that and get it.","June 24, 2014","true","94.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After playing through chapter one and part of chapter 2 I have to say I am very impressed.\n\nIf you are looking for something different from Diablo 3, Torchlight 2, etc this game has it all.  So far the great features:\n\nTons and tons of Tricks, Auoras, and skills to master\nTailor your character points to your play style\nAll three classes come with the 2nd game (No need to purchase DLC)\nLady Katarina's skill tree is very impressive and offer lots of freedom on how you want your companion to fight beside you\nTower Defense missions are awesome ( Plays like Sanctum 2, Adds extra gameplay to mix things up a little)\nThe loot so far is great although I haven't got to runecrafting yet but can't wait\nI think you max level at 60 where as 1st game max was only 30\n\nI know some might be having startup issues and it's aggrevating but developer will get issues resolved.  1st game had bugs and it improved drastically and when I played it now I never had a glitch so this shows the developer stands beyond their games and not abandon them.\n\nIf you are wanting a different kind of hack'n'slash top down RPG this game is well worth the $14.99.  With all the lore and content the game has to offer this game to me is worth more than what they are asking.  I will review more features as I get deeper in the game.

Starting a new character is actually a little more intuitive for people who want to start with a more pre-defined class since you can get a bit more specific right off the bat. You can transfer your old characters provided they're level 30 I think, which is great even though it's practically a necessity.They added in runes for your weapons and armor, at least I don't remember it being in the first game, and I havn't messed with it yet but the interface and process seems easy to do. There are no clunky systems, every part of the UI is simple and easy to use, plenty of loot to grab, high replayability, EXCELLENT voice acting yet again, combat and skills are satisfying and fun to play with, great soundtrack, etc. Also, SUPER FUN if not revolutionary tower defense mini game missions, and great little easter eggs galore. This studio knows their audience very well and loves to put in tons of winks and nods (sometimes full blown call outs, they're that blatant) to stuff we love including lord of the rings and even batman, among other things. Tons of awesomeness in this game, I promise you. Also, this game is a STEAL at 15$, you can't go wrong with this if you're looking for a great arpg.\n\nNow, my only real complaint is actually a kind of compliment: I liked this game so much that it's length left me disappointed, but I'm guessing that the production strategy neocore is going with is to sell each chunk of the series at such a low price so that they can actually stay afloat to make the whole series. I'm guessing they're not a huge studio so this is probably just what they have to do. Something else minor (at least to me), is that there's occasional screen tearing and the odd bugs here and there but nothing game breaking, so I didn't mind it much.\n\nAll in all, I give it a 4.75/5, I loved the hell out of it. Can't wait for the 3rd game.","May 25, 2014","true","13.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/recommended/272470/","lothy","Lothy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lothy/","1455 products in account","* Disclaimer: Review originally written for WalaWala Games[walawalagames.com]. Steam said it was too long, so read the full review at WWG[walawalagames.com]\n\nThe story picks up where Van Helsing I left off -- The little town of Borgovia needs help, and monster hunter extraodinaire Van Helsing is there to aid it. Helping the resistance do what they must to get the city back and fend off the monsters; should you not have played the first installment at all, or if it’s been long since you touched it, the introduction video does a good job of recapping the important bits and summing up what’s been going on.\n\nIf there’s one thing to say for Neocore games it’s that they do pretty neat cinematic cutscenes, very nice and artistic, that give you a distinct feel of watching a movie - unfortunately, even the cutscenes can sometimes be a little bit too long when they’re put in between the action. The voice actors chosen are excellent at their roles; and the chosen depths, tones and infliction the cast uses throughout the game suit the characters very well; helping immerse you in the world. Along with the lovely visual and voices, the game has one of the best soundtracks I’ve heard in an ARPG, fitting the mood and slightly dark atmosphere of the game, atmosphere that is slightly uplifted by the many humorous lines and various pop culture references that are to be found throughout Van Helsing II, as it was in the original.\n\nThe graphics improve a little on Van Helsing I, but in my opinion they still seem to lack some optimization. Despite my computer being the recommended setup for the game, and despite being in low settings, I had the exact same problem with the game I did during my playthrough of Van Helsing I ... LAG. From the get go the game is just a little bit slow, and after about an hour or more of playing the game would become really slow and laggy, sometimes even freezing up for a few seconds if I continue playing. And this was in the single player campaign. It was also noticeable during loading screens - loading the game takes just a little too long sometimes, particularly during the initial loading screen.\n\nDespite that, and jumping into the actual gaming aspect, Van Helsing II can be a delight to play. Right off the bat you’re given the option to either import a character from Van Helsing I or play with a new one which you can start from level 1 or from level 30 with a pre-designed one, which is great for trying out the different classes and builds; the difficulty of the levels also accommodates depending on which starting point you choose, so you’ll still get the full experience without finding it “too easy” just because you chose to start at level 30 instead.\n\nI chose to start anew so I could get a fresh look at the game, plus, it’d been a long while since I’d last played the originial, so a refresher course wouldn’t hurt. When starting your get you get to choose between three classes: Hunter, Thaumaturge or Arcane Mechanic. The classes are all quite different from each other, and each one has a very ample skill tree (and choice of auras) to pick and choose from, so everyone is likely to find a mix of powers and skills that suit their playing style perfectly. Personally, my favorite character is still the Hunter, though the other two can be fun to play too. My only regret in the system would be that I’d like for a bit more customization options outside the skill tree (maybe more visual variety), yet in the end it doesn’t make much of a difference.\n\nOnce you make your character you’ll also have access to the options menu (why you don’t have access to this before that is beyond me), which gives you plenty of chances to remap keys and change audio and video options. Some of these require you to relaunch the game to go into effect, which is a bit annoying as it takes long to load.\n\nKatarina is once more with you during the game. I like the companionship and the role she plays in the overall story and gaming aspects. She can carry stuff, you can send her out shopping, and you can pick how she will behave during fights (ranged, melee, aid only, etc), all of which is pretty neat. They also have great chemistry between them, making you feel less lonely during the map runs.\n\nThe monsters are all well designed, with a fair variety to them and interesting looks and powers. The game has various difficulty modes ranging from casual to hardcore, and you can switch them at any time, yet I noticed that it seems a bit unbalanced regardless of what difficulty mode you’ve chosen: either the enemies are far too easy or far too hard, all in the same map and mode.\n\nThe story is fairly linear and simple, but it's also intriguing; the characters are interesting, and the questing follows the same vein of its predecessor. The tower defense mode also returns, improved, and you can now send captains to do some of those quests for you, which is a nice change in pace (as I’m not particularly fond of defending things, I’m more into destroying them). The downside of this is every so often they interrupt your questing with information, “demanding” you get back to take care of a situation or another (you don’t really need to drop everything to do as they ask, and I believe you can turn this off, but the interruption is annoying nonetheless).\n\nThe first time you’re thrown into the fry -meaning the tutorial and the very first city-defending section- I found it all a tad confusing and frustrating. During the tutorial there were some pop ups that went by just a little too fast for me to read - it was only a couple, yet it was bothersome enough as I couldn’t really remember what all did and was. During the city section I had problems finding my way until I got used to the map indicators again, and then I had a bit of troubles finding some of the more out-of-the-way stairs and elevators, and choosing which answer would be correct for what I wanted to do; however, once you get past that area, the gameplay goes pretty smoothly, and if there was one thing I did appreciate it was that, while there were many things to learn, at least the main interface didn’t look cluttered.\n\nThe game offers witty dialogue and, when questing, allows you yo choose from two or three answers. I like being able to choose when talking to characters (though most of the time is just the two typical ‘yes’ or ‘no’ disguised in a colorful fashion), however it suffered from the same all the ‘choose your answer’ games suffer from: none were clear. An answer did not quite mean what I thought it would mean which made me miss a quest (for instance, on Saving Bryan had two answers that were very similar but different in tone, and I thought the second option would also give me a chance to end the conversation and go look for him, but it didn’t and it sent me elsewhere with that mission failed). I was rather annoyed to have some missions failed or postponed (or even denied completely from trying them later) simply because the option I chose still included some form of “give me more time” or “I can’t right now” but it ended up cancelling the quest instead and the quest indicator disappeared. I had the same with a quest where I could either destroy a totem or find a relic, and when I refused destroying it initially but then changed my mind, I couldn’t go back and destroy it, so I was forced on the second quest path.\n\nAfter the first chapter you get to have a “pet”; a chimera you can either send to fetch stuff for you, or summon into battle. This is quite handy, and the chimera is quite adorable (in the way giant, angry beasts are adorable, I guess). It even chases around little animals while in the lair.\n\nThe areas you get to visit are [...]","July 8, 2015","true","8.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

TLDR: buy it now.\n\nVan Helsing II stars right where the first game ended, allowing you to continue your campaign with your existing character, or start a new one either at level 1 or 30. Unlike, say, the transition between Diablo 1 and 2, there are no changes in fundamentals; VH2's tactic is to be a bigger, better version of the first game, and at that it's wildly successful.\n\nThe gorgeous visuals of the first game are enhanced by excellent weather and atmospheric effects, plus some truly impressive spell effects that had me constantly wanting to mash the screenshot key.\nThe excellent soundtrack returns, plus around the same amount of new music again, joined by surprisingly good voice acting and an array of viscerally satisfying sound effects layered on top of an ambience that combine to give the game a wonderful sense of atmosphere.\n(By the way, it does support multi-channel configurations, though I'm not sure if audio effects are fully positional with respect to the extra channels.)\n\nIn terms of gameplay mechanics, VH2 takes the first game and extends it; all of the features from VH1 return as-is, and are expanded by enough new skills and abilities to give the game a great deal of customisability. There are three character classes, but by the time you've customised your character with the skills you want, two players with the same class could - probably will - have radically different play styles. I think they did a pretty good job of avoiding the Diablo 3 problem where some skills are effectively mandatory, and others are basically worthless, and I think overall it has a greater degree of viable character customisation, but of course there are some skills that seem weaker or stronger than others. You can fully respec every character choice if you wish, though it comes at a price. If you want to try out a wide variety of options with the same character, prepare to save up a *lot* of gold. If you choose to start with a level 30 character, there are a few pre-made options to pick from that give some variety in character builds (or you can make up your own of course). Being a game about one specific character, you obviously don't get to play anyone else, so there's not going to be any option for a female hero - the game would need to be entirely rescripted. Of course this is so obvious that I almost didn't even bring it up, but I know that kind of thing disappoints some players so I thought I'd mention it.\n\nI found the gameplay to be highly engaging throughout, even when I was getting my posterior handed to me (I'm just saying, that's a whole lot of ornithopters to fight while there are pools of poison all over the floor and homing incendiary bombs being launched at my face). I can't imagine anyone who liked the first game being disappointed here. I'd say that the main campaign is probably about half as long again, with some added variety in environments and fight mechanics (I can call down an artillery strike? Hmm, that has significant friendly-fire potential). Don't expect any *major* novelty there - we're still basically visiting wilderness, city, and areas in the ink - but it's not just rehashes of exactly the same zones, and some of the additions are... honestly pretty breathtaking. I love being able to look down at the city far below me. One of the things that sets the VH games apart from other ARPGs like D3 or Torchlight is that there are a lot of areas where you can see, for example, another level in the dungeon, and rather than being essentially just a complicated backdrop that tantalises but remains forever out of reach, here it's frequently another part of the level that you can get to.\n\nI've played a lot of ARPGs since the first Diablo, and honestly I'd be pretty comfortable in saying that this is the best since Diablo 2 was released in 2000. I'd have no hesitation recommending it even at three times the price.\n\nOriginal, first impressions review follows:\n\nFirst, if you didn't like the first one, look elsewhere. This is basically more of the same. You can import your old character, and the game starts seemingly immediately after the ending of the first one. In fact, it's so much like an extended version of the original game that I'm a little surprised it wasn't released as an expansion. The gameplay is essentially an incremental step from VH1, with some added features and extended character progression.\n\nThat said, I'm not upset about this. I enjoyed VH1 a great deal, and this - so far at least - seems just like a further iteration, which is exactly what I was expecting. The gameplay updates may be fairly minor in the overall scheme, but they're good nonetheless (and I've only played a couple of hours - there could be more in store). Given that it costs less than an expansion pack for most big-budget games, anyone disappointed by the similarity in gameplay might do well to think of it as a standalone expansion, if that helps.\n\nI find the game has a great visual appeal - I love the art style and the atmosphere, and the music is great (it can all be found as oggs in the install directory, and it has all the music from VH1 plus about the same amount again).\n\nOverall I'd say this is one of the better entries in the genre for quite some time.","May 23, 2014","true","23.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

This is really my main qualm with the game. The storyline of this game is really disappointing. Maybe the storyline isn't disappointing [as it makes sense in the context of VH1], but the way it is executed is disappointing. The questing sucks. Very little variation, mostly based around tower defense. The vast majority of your missions are "secure X, Y, Z points by battling through streams of enemies.\n\n\nIf you did not play the first game, don't buy this.

I say single player because there is almost nobody playing this game online, which is too bad. It's more thought out than Diablo 3, and feels a bit higher budget than Path of Exile. If you're looking for a great ARPG experience to play solo, pick up TIAOVH 2.\n\nThere are tower defense modes, a story (campaign) mode, and some amazing easter eggs thrown in for good measure. Item drops are generous and on point with your character (after my first play through I was wearing 40% "Unique" quality items) and the classes all do different things.\n\nThat being said, the class balance could use a little work, the mage feels great at wiping away lots of trash mobs and definitely has advantages against bosses, but the engineer is amazingly powerful, especially post-veteran.\n\n8/10, would recommend and would play again!\n\n------\nI cannot recommend a product that refuses to work. After following the (multiple) threads to fix the problems, the game persists in failing to load. If you want to play a game, look elsewhere. I've written Steam about it and commented on the community page for the game.\n\nI'll update this review if the problems are fixed. Such a let down.","August 30, 2014","true","38.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

That's not just a travesty, it's fraud and a breach of trust. When will game software companies quit rushing development and production for quick sales. It makes me wonder if they even hired a QA team at all. I don't pay money for a game just for it to crash on me every time I open it. This is not entirely Neocore's fault but the Steam client and team as well for not making sure the build was stable enough for release and sale. If you're wanting to play this game, avoid any frustration and wait about six months to a year. After they have patched it thoroughly and made it completely stable to the point it's actually playable.","May 23, 2014","false","30.2"," 15 of 34 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","15","34","0","4"

I had to turn almost all the graphics enhancements off to reduce the lag, as that's what killed me 9 times out of 10.  Gameplay consists mainly of spamming the same powers over and over ad nauseum and using a health or mana potion intermittently.  I ignored the tower defense section almost entirely and delegated the tasks to NPCs.  The story was not all that interesting again, and the voice acting for the assisting characters got on my nerves.  The ending to the game is underwhelming, and they expect you to play through the campaign again in order to unlock scenarios.

Only global conditions (buffs/debuffs) to players and enemies and area objectives change (that's not enough).\n\nDifficulty in this game means large enemy numbers with high health. There is only two types of enemies (they only look different) melee or ranged and they often spawn smaller minions non stop, that's it! As a result the game will always put you to sleep from being too easy, or if you raise the difficulty, from monotonous neverending battles.\n\nThe game is filled with countless pop culture references some are funny and seamlessly incorporated, but vast majority is just too obvious and bland, to the point of being simple word to word quotes - very boring.\n\nIt looks decent, and should appeal to all who like Victorian steampunk, but again that's not nearly enough.\n\nPS:\nIf you are still interested, buy it during deeply discounted sale, and do not buy any DLC for it, they are of the worst kind (the kind that does not add or improve anything, and provides more of the same at even lower quality than the game itself).","December 18, 2014","false","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Loved gameplay of storyline even though it felt more like a connection to the third game, Katarina is funny as always and it was for the most part amusing.\n\nBiggest hiccup was hitting end game content (i.e. Scenarios) where I was DRAMATICALLY underequipped, and really the only decent way of getting gear was from the pigasus. So I had to slide my bloody, grumpy, body through scenarios flailing my failing limbs around until I could afford one piece of pigasus gear (~10 mil standard), after which it got much better. That said, scenarios are fun but bless their hearts they just kill me sometimes.\n\nPROS:\n- Funy(ny) storyline, well written and obviously well planned. No awkward tacked on sequel bait.\n- Included DLC classes from first game with more skills, all of which are fun.\n- Decently improved multiplayer from first game, still glitches during storyline and crashed game multiple times during scenario runs in endgame, but much improved from where they started in first Van Helsing.\n- Much better gear drops than in first game, makes farming much more exciting\n- Better endgame than first, though that's not really saying much since the first games endgame didn't drop much\n\nCONS:\n- Endgame has some very cheap feeling shots at the player (will cover seperately, not terribly detrimental to the game at large) .\n- Slightly buggy multiplayer using LAN connection (can't speak for full wifi)\n\nENDGAME:\nAnd here we come to the crux of most of my issues. Endgame is vastly improved and generally a very good experience but with that said some of the things they throw at you just feel like they were player tested on devs and didn't see much actual exposure to a realistic player base.\nYou start out with a difficulty curve that in reality is more of a mountain (could maybe be solved by having the final boss drop a piece of pigasus gear?), and though you climb the mountain and can get a huge amount of satisfaction from doing so the mechanics of the scenario system sometimes feel engineered to take the wind out of your sails.\n\nThe whole scenario system suffers from a distinct feeling of a lack of agency, you get no choice what maps, what penalties, and what objectives you'll have to complete when running one of the 6 objective scenarios and almost more painful is the lack of ability to even choose what order you run them in. You literally get thrown into one and get penalized for rerolling it if the difficulty's too high, if the penalties are too harsh or unprepared for at current gear level, or if you fail on of the objectives. You even get penalized if you reroll the scenario before FINALIZING it (something that I can't tell if was intended, or if it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bug).\n\nThat all added together the scenarios are generally enjoyable, and actually very fun, but all of the joy you can expect to get out of them MUST be measured against your ability to not get upset when bashing your head against a wall of unforgiving and blatantly punishing mechanics. For example, there are "clue finding" objectives in the scenarios which ask the player to kill groups of elites around the map in a time limit. The implementation of this objective in particular ends up making it feel almost impossible to beat, and generally kills my enthusiam for continuing if paired with a horrible map and a bad penalty. Take home message to devs, hard is fun, challenging is funner, but punishing (i.e. player gets penalized with no agency and no ability to mitigate damage) is just asking for patience, not enjoyment.\n\nTL;DR -\nGreat game, worth a purchase (will immediatly buy next game) and recomended to be played after first. Endgame suffers from several flaws (feels like devs made it planning for everyone to have maxed out gear, nothing less) and it is deeply recomended by myself to start on casual (normal is not normal, normal is hard). All in all, worth the money though I'd say wait for a sale if you're unsure. Fans of the first will love it though, and if you are it's worth a full purchase.","December 22, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Honestly one of the biggest perks for me is the flexability of the game; you can change the difficulty at any time, and you can die without being hit with super big consequences, which takes the pressure off having to do really well. The later difficulties are challenging without being over the top, and strategy plays a big part on whether you win in fights or not; there's more to it than just having a high level or good armor.\n\nOther things I liked about the game; fast paced and interesting storyline, lots of features, a good array of weapons/equipment, interesting skill trees. I found the gameplay to be fun and interesting.\n\nstrong perk: you can change your skills and stats repeatedly!!!\n\nbiggest negative I found is the multiplayer has been hard to find other players for.","December 17, 2014","true","61.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It takes me 2 minutes from the moment I click on the desktop icon to start playing the actual game. Two minutes!\n2) I can play most new games at the maximum settings, but for some reason, Van Helsing II lags even on the lowest settings.\n3) The maps are not randomized.\n4) The name of the game is silly and way too long.\n5) Too many cutscenes and talking. This was supposed to be an ARPG where you just run around and kill kill kill and click click click, not an RPG like Baldur's Gate. Less talking, more action and more loot. Oh, speaking about loot:\n6) Not enough loot. I destroy every barrel, kill every monster and I only get a few drops.\n7) Rage mechanic doesn't tell you when it's activated. A sound effect or a graphic representation would be nice. It would be even nicer if the Rage worked like in Torchlight 2, where when you reach maximum rage, you are super powerful for 10 seconds or so, instead of these "combos".\n8) Too many mobs. Seriously, when 15 fast moving guys just surround you, there isn't much you can do, especially if you are a ranged class.\n9) The game graphic seems outdated, like I'm playing a game from 2005.\n10) UI is pretty bad. In every decent ARPG it is ESSENTIAL to have a good view of your health and mana bars (or orbs). In Van Helsing, they are barely visible.\n\nAll in all, a poor attempt at an ARPG game. If you want the real thing, I suggest: Diablo 2, Torchlight 2 or Titan Quest.","January 10, 2015","false","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was completely new to the franchise but picked up the game relatively quickly. At the time of wrting this reveiw I have completed the game with one of the three characters and I have just started a new story with a second character on veteran. The veteran option allows you to play the story mode from a level 30 character which was a really nice addition which provided a very different style of gameplay and more features, so it was as if you are getting two games for the price of one. However I was initally confused why I was only level 30 after completing the campaign on casual mode.\n\nGamplay functions as a normal RPG should. however I do stuggle with some aspects such as very small action bars (1-6) and the left mouse being responsible for movement and the primary attack which would send me running into a hoarde of enemies instead of attacking them. Bosses are challenging and hoardes of enemies can take you down even on the easy settings.  The tower defence, chimera and resistence side quests/activities/tasks are a nice aspect of the game which allow you to earn more money and experience whilst keeping you entertained. Sometimes the game crashes which is inconveinient but it hasn't drastically affected my gameplay.\n\nThe amount of choice is with regard to skills and items is mind boggling. It is as if each item is compeltely unique and offers a different range of stats which is great however it can become time consuming to make a decision as to what you want to equip. There are excellent features in the options that allow you to automatically equip the best items though. The skill tree/ tricks/ auras are fairly large for both you and your ghostly companion and as such I spent a lot of time make decisions about how to spend my skill/ability points.\n\nOverall it is pleasure to play and will probably keep me entertained for 2 or 3x the time I have already played.

Would recommend if it is on sale.\n\nONE MAJOR THING. The most important thing I saw from this game was that it could use a little more polishing. More than a handful of gramatical errors like loose instead of lose. It really took me out of the game and some of the texts didn't match up from the soundtrack. One quest, Gate of Perun was broken for me. Maybe one more week should have been spent polishing up this game, or release a patch to fix all these errors. Its just silly that this would occur to detract from an otherwise awesome game.\n\nAlso, you can't go back and redo some quests which is really moronic. But none the less, great game.

Both have a light-hearted and engaging gothic story.\n\nI bought all DLC for both without second thought because of my enjoyment of them.\n\nHowever issues arrose after the update wherein permanent ADVERTISEMENTS for an upcoming title were added to Van Helsing 2 and my Gamepad was no longer able to select skill upgrades for any skills more than halfway down the page.  Also sometimes when using a gamepad the highlighted cursor would dissapear when upgrading or interacting with Katarina.\n\nI posted about this issue on the technical support forum for the game on steam and received a response but nothing definitive or helpful.  It has been many months since this update and I have attempted to replace my gamepad and it's drivers several times since them in order to see if it could somehow be on my end.  In all situations the problem remains identical and only for this game.\n\nGamepad support is my primary reason for buying any game and I invested fully in this company because I believed that they would bring excellent gamepad support to this title.  Instead they started with passable gamepad support and stripped it with a patch that added permanent advertisements.\n\nI love this company and their games and have done everything in my power to find a solution that did not put this issue in their hands.  Now I have no choice but to recommend that no one buy this game if they wish to use a gamepad.","January 30, 2015","false","66.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They put out a new game, but didn't do anything with the classes really except extend them. The tower defense aspect is still in the game, and they made it more fun in some aspects because traps actually do something this time, but more boring as well since the mass mobs just coming at you without any hope for gear dropping, and getting almost no XP from them, makes it boring.\n\nYou now have extra mini game's or something, i dont even know how to describe them, in the game to play around with. You have some beast that you can have go on missions, and he comes back with gear. Simple and to the point, w/e, free gear i guess. Secondly you have three captains that go off on missions and you level them up. I  dont get the point of these guys, they dont give you anything, i cant tell that they make any difference in my gameplay, but they're there, and you can send them on missions. But they do this whole "you're a general, command your troops" thing in this game, all throughout, but it feels like the decisions you make dont really matter, which is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ feeling.\n\nFinally, they added a runecrafter guy to the mix, sadly i was unable to ever use him or the engineer to combine gear since a bug wouldn't allow it to work, which brings me to my final complaint.\n\nBUGS, holy crap is this game buggy. Parts of the game weren't even playable do to this. I ended up beating the game, and generally with AARPG's i play the hell out of them, over and over. Van helsing 2 does not give me that want, i dont want to play it, at all. I have hundred's of hours in Diablo 3 (♥♥♥♥♥♥ game as well), Torchlight 1 and 2 (both fun to play with friends), hundreds in Path of Exile, and thousands of hours in Diablo 2 (best AARPG to date, ten years later).\n\nTL:DR - Van Helsing 2 is more or less DLC for Van helsing 1, with more bugs, and some busy work to keep you occupied.","July 11, 2014","false","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You find an item and you compare it to whatever it is you are wearing. Displayed stats will show whether or not it's an upgrade. Simple stuff.\n\nCombat is fluid and easy but the game has issues with balancing certain combat situations.

Unlinke the rather boring, blend D3 npcs and mainchars, there's a real chemestry going on here.\nIf you don't get attached to this strange couple during Van Helsing 1, part 2 will do the job.\nThe same goes for every aspect of the series. The catchy soundtrack and melancholic flair make this a very special ride.\nThe whole gameworld is full of detail. you can see the effort this smal dev put into the series and it pays of.\nPart 1 was a complete game: lots of things to collect, loot, grind, many diffrent ways to build the couple for combat -> part 2 builds on this and feels even more refined. New gamemechanics, which build upon the solid groundwork, new build-options and new lvl-hights to achieve.\nI've rarely played 2 a parts of a gameseries that blend this good. They didn't change anything drastic, didn't chop up the story, they pretty much just refined what was already a very good game.\nIf you like hack'n slay/arpg-games this is for you, if you like to explore an interesting setting and protagonists this is for you.\nI can fully recommend both parts of the franchise and seeing how things are now, probably part 3 also.\n","January 8, 2015","true","46.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After reading reviews, I decided to give the first game a shot. Surprisingly to me it turned out to be one of the better ARPG's released in the last several years.\n\nThis game continues where the last one left off. The gameplay is largely the same. The action is very good, the graphics and effects are high quality, and the writing is good, filled with amusing banter from Van Helsing and his ghostly companion, along with plenty of Easter Eggs and offbeat quests.\n\nIf you like Arpg's this one and its predecessor are both very good games. Frankly I like them both better than the new Diablo. In fact the only arpg's released in the last several years that I think are better are: Dragon Age Inquisition, Witcher 3, Path of Exile, Dark Souls II. I'd say this game is on a par with Diablo III or Torchlight II. Maybe not as massive as Torchlight II, but with better writing and story.\n\n8.5/10","May 19, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Way more skills, more variations of builds, massive loot variation (want to build a tanky mage? Sure). Your ghost companion can now do some good DPS, support, or whatever you choose. There's always something different to do. The tower defense games are better (you can skip them if you dont' like tower defense). Sending your underlings on missions is a good mini game in itself.

As a result the game will always put you to sleep from being too easy, or if you raise the difficulty, from monotonous neverending battles.\n\nThe game is filled with countless pop culture references some are funny and seamlessly incorporated, but vast majority is just too obvious and bland, to the point of being simple word to word quotes - very boring.\n\nIt looks decent, and should appeal to all who like Victorian steampunk, but again that's not nearly enough.\n\nPS:\nIf you are still interested, buy it during deeply discounted sale, and do not buy any DLC for it, they are of the worst kind (the kind that does not add or improve anything, and provides more of the same at even lower quality than the game itself).","December 18, 2014","false","30.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't try to drag the campaign out with fillers, so it always feels fresh. New elements are introduced all the way into the end-game, so even while your character progresses, you are also exposed to new mini-games such as tower defense, side missions using your 4 captains, and treasure hunting using your chimera.\n\nIt doesn't feel repetitive at all, unless you're going for a second playthrough.\n\nWhich is the other very nice thing I like about the game. It lets you CHOOSE right from the beginning if you want to start at level 1 or level 30. I always picked level 30, because then it lets you access mid-progression skills right from the get-go, instead of grinding your way into a second playthrough in order to unlock the good skills.\n\nRating: 9/10","April 12, 2015","true","19.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was completely new to the franchise but picked up the game relatively quickly. At the time of wrting this reveiw I have completed the game with one of the three characters and I have just started a new story with a second character on veteran. The veteran option allows you to play the story mode from a level 30 character which was a really nice addition which provided a very different style of gameplay and more features, so it was as if you are getting two games for the price of one. However I was initally confused why I was only level 30 after completing the campaign on casual mode.\n\nGamplay functions as a normal RPG should. however I do stuggle with some aspects such as very small action bars (1-6) and the left mouse being responsible for movement and the primary attack which would send me running into a hoarde of enemies instead of attacking them. Bosses are challenging and hoardes of enemies can take you down even on the easy settings.  The tower defence, chimera and resistence side quests/activities/tasks are a nice aspect of the game which allow you to earn more money and experience whilst keeping you entertained. Sometimes the game crashes which is inconveinient but it hasn't drastically affected my gameplay.\n\nThe amount of choice is with regard to skills and items is mind boggling. It is as if each item is compeltely unique and offers a different range of stats which is great however it can become time consuming to make a decision as to what you want to equip. There are excellent features in the options that allow you to automatically equip the best items though. The skill tree/ tricks/ auras are fairly large for both you and your ghostly companion and as such I spent a lot of time make decisions about how to spend my skill/ability points.\n\nOverall it is pleasure to play and will probably keep me entertained for 2 or 3x the time I have already played.

My one complaint is the jokes stuck into a game that has a somewhat serious tone. In my few hours of playing there's already been a harry potter, saving private ryan, and angry birds reference, all delivered clumsily, not even in a tongue-in-cheek way, with no real punchline or payoff, only serving to pull you out of the story. I still plan on playing this game for dozens of hours because I'm interested in loot, but the script and voice acting are pretty bad.\n-UPDATE AFTER PLAYING OVER 30 HOURS-\nI greatly enjoyed this game, and the extra scenarios they have after you've beaten veteran were a great idea to keep up replayability. Fun and addictive, the only thing obviously "indie" about the game  the extremely predictable story, which, although you can make choices, those choices really don't change much at all, they just offer a possibility of an extra mob or two to fight.  (which is my only complaint about the game), and I wish they expanded further on the missions where you can send commanders to complete objectives, and it wasn't just the same thing through every playthrough, where the commander choice was exceedingly obvoius and you get the same missions each game. I have had a few times where I've walked into a patch of land and not been able to move due to bad mapping, but I was able to TP out (if you walk far to the right of the entrance to the place that's attached by spiderwebs near the end of the campaign, wormwood chasm i think it's called, it's easy to get stuck in the geometry). Anyway, great game, I'll definitely look forward to more in this series.","January 9, 2015","true","80.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They likely kept to the same core and went with "If it ain't broke..."\n\nVan Helsing 2 offers a bit more freedom than the first, mainly due to the 2nd having all the DLC included which you can buy for the first game. This means the 2 classes, Arcane Mechanic and Thaumaturgist can be played. Blue Blood is also part of the game, so your ghostly companion Katharina is far more versatile and interesting in terms of skills for her.\n\nThe little golden gem of the game, being the tower defence in the Secret Lair has been expanded a fair bit with more levels and more maps, instead of just the usual level.\n\nAside from that, there is plenty of new secrets, a Chimera creature for treasure hunting, NPC team members in the Lair usable for quests related only to them, trophies for game changes and much more.\n\nThe whole campaign feels a bit short, but definitely enjoyable. The campaign can be replayed in a Veteran version, other modes and Scenarioes for more challenges.","September 19, 2015","true","64.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While having to wait a week to complete the game, as my save file was fixed by the developers, they did indeed fix it. They've also patched one of the problems I mentioned and are working on patching the other. The point is neocoregames is actively trying to support their games and I have to commend them for the effort. The fact is, this game is so good that it is easy to hold it to the standards of a AAA game, and frankly, it should be. There is so much to love about this game (I can't speak for the other two), that if these wrinkles are ironed out, I could see a lot more people taking a chance on an unknown Hungarian talent. I finally finished the story and I was not disappointed.\n\nUPDATE: IMPORTANT - 27 hours in and I encountered a bug where a quest NPC does not appear. I cannot progress further. I cannot finish the game. This is a known issue. Google revealed multiple threads dealing with the same issue. Going to steam for a refund. 27 hours gone on a game I can't finish. Seriously.\n\nI'm not downvotimg this game. I chose thumbs down because honestly, I couldn't recommend it to anyone in good faith. There is SO much potential here, but Neocoregames as a developer have decided to exploit there games rather than finish them. These games are just not finished.\n\nLook, I love the story. I love the humor, the art, the music, the loot system, everything. It is the perfect hack and slash game, but these Hungarians are more interested in the short term. They want to make a quick buck and move onto the next thing. I don't know who owns the company, but chances are they aren't a gamer and more of an entrepreneur. Each new game or DLC means new clothes, or house, or cars for them. It's the only thing that explain the horrible ♥♥♥♥ing mess these games degrade into\n\nFirst, there was no native controller support. Then, they tacked it on post development and its atrocious. Menus are clunky to navigate, features are just missing. You can't read any flavor text or descriptions. There are tower defense levels, but you'll later realize YOU CAN'T even reach the most important towers using a controller.\n\nThere are weird visuals on the screen when using a controller. Certain menus can crash your game (search for skills crash, merchant crash, or rune crash).\n\nPoint is, I want to love this game so much. There are so many funny moments and the gameplay could've been top notch, but there's no ignoring the problems. Every hour invested in this game is tempting disappointment. It's like dating someone you don't trust. You haven't caught them cheating, but you know you're risking having your heart broken. Stay for love, or leave for your own sanity. I've finally chosen sanity.\n\nCiao Van helsing.","June 17, 2015","true","34.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played Grim Dawn, Diablo or Torchlight you'll be familiar with the gameplay. The game does have a unique ability system though, as you fight you gain rage which can be spent to powerup your abilities. For example lets say you're using a lightning spell, powering it up may cause enemies to be shocked, or it may increase the number of enemies hit. A powered up spell only has one charge and can be activated with the spacebar, although this becomes tedious very fast and I'd wager 99.9% of people have this set to auto cast whenever available. The game allows you to set up powerup presets so you can very much set it and forget it and the game will automatically boost the chosen ability(s) whenever you have sufficient rage. Apart from that it's your usual aRPG fare, you have a standard talent tree with forks and paths, passive abilities and stat points which allow you to customise your character further.\n\nThroughout the game you're accompanied by your ghostly companion, Katarina. She works very much like the Torchlight pet, she can pick up items, fight for you and even be sent back to town to sell and buy which saves you the bother! She also has her own stats and talent tree, you can either build her to become stronger herself, or build her as a complete buff bot which will give you lots of powerful auras. Usefulness aside she's actually a big part of the game, and the banter between you and her is often really enjoyable, the voice acting for both Van Helsing and Katarina is top notch (the same can't be said for all the characters though!).\n\nThe story will take around 10 hours to complete which is poor, and shorter than the first game. You will finish the story around level 30 but to do scenarios you'll need to be level 57 and I couldn't work out how to level up further. Perhaps this was only intended for people who imported their character from Van Helsing I but I started a new character so was much lower level by the end of the game.\n\nTechnically the game is fine, most quests have voice acting which isn't always a given for this genre, especially from the smaller studios, and while not perfect it is pretty funny at times and there are plenty of references to other games and TV shows which I enjoyed. I will say the voice acting for Prisoner 7 is terrible, absolutely terrible and lowers the quality of the entire game by being so bad. Graphically the game is OK, it's a couple of years old and wouldn't have been anything to rave about back then, but it's fine. Performance is worse than Van Helsing I which stayed at 60fps without dips, whereas Van Helsing II will often dip in frame rate, and certain areas have issues and completely tank the frame rate. There is also a nasty bug with DX11 and Windows 8.1 where textures will not load, I suffered with this often and it made the game extremely frustrating at times.\n\nOverall it's better than Van Helsing I, but it also introduces its own problems so I can't score it higher than 6/10, which is what I gave the first game. And once again I can only recommend buying this game while it's 75% off.","July 7, 2015","true","11.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sound is a very important aspect in making the combat feel responsive and satisfying, and the game fails in this area. Hearing the same enemy type have only a single death scream means you'll get very tired of killing them - which should NEVER happen in an ARPG game. Imagine watching a movie with loads of fighting, and whenever someone dies, you hear the Wilhelm Scream. Over and over again. Not good.\n\nYou gain levels quite quickly, but each level feels insignificant. In fact, it becomes a chore to level up. This is yet another reason why playing the game does not feel good.\n\nI haven't played the game long enough to tell how the boss fights work out, but that is because I can't bring myself to play the game any longer.

Beginning with the ability to import a saved character from the first game, II delivers an additional thirty levels of experience, new items, skills, quests, tower defense levels, enemies, quests, and sarcastic retorts from the ghostly Lady Katerina. It is more linear then the first game, with fewer sidequests overall but more tower defense levels, and additional side mechanics that allow you to send out NPC captains to  perform offscreen missions, rewarding you with additional gold and items, and an additional pet with customizable abilities. The equipment-modding obsessed can now alter their equipment in an additional way, via stat-increasing runes. While Van Helsing II treads ground already heavily traveled, it is nonetheless an excellent Diablolike and arguably a better singleplayer experience then many other titles in the genre, due in no small part to Van Helsing's both varied and powerful skillset. My hunter-class Van Helsing was capable of dealing extrordinary damage both to single targets and in an area, but was also very survivable thanks to a lot of lifesteal. The game is significantly easier on its normal difficulty then other titles in the genre, including the first Van Helsing, but offers two additional difficulty levels beyond that along with repeatable, randomized, high-level dungeons for the discerning munchkin. I will be proceeding directly to Van Helsing III and what I hope is a thrilling conclusion to the trilogy, and I will look forward greatly to Neocore's recently announced Warhammer 40,000 ARPG, Inquisitor - Martyr.","July 26, 2015","true","14.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatcigarette/recommended/272470/","thatcigarette","Ttack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatcigarette/","148 products in account","Summary\nNot Recommended because there are better alternatives on the market, and even if you have already played them, this game is mostly mediocre and does many things poorly. The developer is also very slow or just reluctant to fix the game's bugs (BIG red flag). The writing and characters may be the only saving graces, as actual gameplay is unimpressive, even boring.\n\nThe Bad\nThe combat is really boring and character management is a chore. The UI is ugly and unrefined, even (or especially) at high resolutions and levels of detail. The game's DX11 support remains hopelessly broken, and the game looks dated. There is good detail in the environment and, to a lesser extent, the characters, but neither really come alive; there is no flair to the action, no spice in the surroundings, and definitely not enough variety to raise interest. There are also odd lapses in the finishing touches, like subtitles getting cut off, jaggies and tearing out of nowhere, some actions look like they're missing animations or frames (bad transitions between movements, attacks, etc.), and the environment's colour scheme quickly fades into shades of grey.\n\nThe game does run well in DX9 - you can crank up the detail and effects even on low-spec cards - but it all looks dreary and unimpressive due to an apparent lack of inspiration and polish, and clunky mechanics get in the way a lot. This is Bad for a supposed Action RPG. This is more in the style of old top-down RPGs than modern ARPGs.\n\nThe Good\nCopying and improving the pet system from Torchlight is a definite plus. Even if the loot system is classic in style, Katarina makes management and vendor sales a breeze.\n\nI really like the VO and dialogue for Van Helsing and Katarina, and the storyline and characters appear to be the strong suit of the game. Too bad the focus is on combat and not questing and characters, so the writing does not get to shine much outside of cutscenes. The other VO varies in quality (the Main Ally is amateur quality, almost a joke), but the writing seems to stay solid - at least at the start.\n\nThere are good attempts to vary the gameplay by involving allied units, building, et cetera, but it's too bland in execution. Nice try though.\n\nI sort of like the focus on just three character classes, but they feel like the devs just wanted to artificially extend game hours: it's the same hack-and-slash scuffle three times over, and the visual and mechanical variety is, again, a little uninspired.\n\nThe Alternatives\nSo what would I recommend instead?\n\nPath of Exile http://store.steampowered.com/app/238960/ Free to play and works much better. Not broken either. Diablo players will be right at home. The only downsides are that the bosses are weak and the storyline over much too soon. There's also no character development (but that's no surprise). It's a grinder like Diablos 1 and 2 (and 3), but very enjoyable to play - and F2P (all paid content is cosmetics, pets, etc. and does not negatively affect gameplay or market mechanics)! You can also play solo or with friends, depending on if you want more Story or Action.\n\nVictor Van Hel--, I mean, Victor Vran http://store.steampowered.com/app/345180/ Does a much better job of the whole vampire/monster hunter gig. The writing and characters are good, the combat is fun, and skills and loot have refreshing twists to them. The Narrator is entertaining, and makes up for the lack of a companion like Katarina.\n\nDiablo 3 is cautiously recommended. It's pricey and has its foibles, but if you use Battle.net anyway and just want to hack things apart, it's as decent as Blizzard creations get - very well polished and pleasant to play, plus the universe might be familiar to you already.\n\nAnd that's just the ARPGs that come to mind that I have played. There are more that I haven't, and a whole library of other entertaining and immersive RPG titles, both classic and new, that you can explore, and often very affordably so - try GOG.com if it's not on Steam, or if you like your games without DRM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.","August 8, 2015","false","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But after that was done, the game found and imported my old character and I was off. The gameplay is about the same as Van Helsing 1 and the new areas were fun to play. I enjoyed their two minigames they added - some management game with your soldiers, and also having a pet that you can feed and send to hunt. The voice acting was great as well.\n\nMy main gripes would be the long loading time between areas, the horrible 10-15 minute initialization on your game's first launch, as well as the lacklustre storyline. For some reason, the game also felt very short (finished it shy of 20 hours).\n\nFor this I would recommend the game, however I believe this game only deserves a 6/10.\n\nEdit: Added thoughts on completing time.","August 20, 2015","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
