"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/recommended/296870/","kermamrek","Kerma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kermamrek/","289 products in account","So after 100%ing this game and finding absolutely everything that you can do in 2 hours (would be under that if I didn't have issues with bugs, as the game just came out yesterday) I'm going to go ahead and recommend it but tell you a bunch of reasons why you shouldn't buy it if you're on the fence. Hang on while I explain.\n\nI personally think this game is well made. I had a prepaid mastercard with 5 dollars left on it, and I looked at "recently released adventure games" and saw this. Being a fan of Yume Nikki and other games like it (because honestly, it's become a subgenre at this point) I decided to take the plunge. Usually I wouldn't put money down on a Yume Nikki fangame type thing because they're usually uninspired and involve a lot of bad game design, but this looked well made based on the screenshots and sold me with the trailer music. It was 3 dollars on sale, so I figured at the worst I could sell the trading cards and make back ~50% of what I spent on it.\n\nFirst off: If you've played a Yume Nikki game before, this follows the formula to an almost funny extent.\nDreams? ☑\nLooping levels? ☑\nWeird Alien things? ☑\nDrug references? ☑\nHospital Level? ☑\nCreepy Eye Motif? ☑\nViscera Level? ☑\nThemes of questioning self and regret? ☑\n\nHowever, if you haven't or the above doesn't bother you by being sort of done before (and I was ok with it, because it was done fairly well) then prepare for a weird platformer with great music and colourful graphics.\n\nGoing to get the thing that might change out of the way: The game is horribly buggy. This is semi-excusable because I'm guessing this is this developer's first major release, and I'm making this review a day after it came out. The developer is in the discussion boards taking bug requests and trying to fix them, so this might change in the short future- but if you're buying this game at this very moment... Be aware!\n\nDreaming Sarah is about a girl in a coma (which should be the game's only spoiler, but isn't considering it's both in the banner ad AND the description for the game) who is exploring her dreaming state. You walk around areas and find powerups to either help you, interact with other characters, or just to have for completionist's sake. The graphics are very pretty, the controls are fluent and simple (but not really instructed in game- I had to just guess what keys did what which only took a few seconds) and the music is relaxing and at times a bit haunting. As shown by my 2 hour play time and 100% achievement completion, the game is really short. Is it worth the money? Well, for almost 4 dollars you can't go wrong, but for 6? Ehhhhhh...\n\nMost games like this are free downloadable titles or flash games you can play, and if Dreaming Sarah was free, I'd be ridiculously impressed and recommend people to play it a bit more. But for more than 3 dollars? It's a fun experience, and if this is the developer's first game released, it's pretty great for what it is. But my main complaint with Dreaming Sarah is that it takes away the essence of exploration usually found in games like this by making it a platformer and not adding enough content. There's nothing to find, no quirky secrets or easter eggs that have a 1/64 chance of happening (there are secrets in the game, but all of them are so close to the path you have to follow that I'd put money on you finding at least 80% of them without trying), and no real "wow I can't believe how crazy this was!" moments that is usually what makes playing exploration based walking simulators like this interesting. It plays it very very safe, and while it's enjoyable to sit down and relax with, it's not worth 6 dollars to play a game through to 100% for an hour and never touch it again.\n\nTake Journey for example. It's 15 dollars on PSN, but it's an hour long. But many people claim it to be a great game for the price. Why? Because there's so much to explore and discover, and even when you're done with that you can meet people and have new experiences every time. With Yume Nikki, the gimmick is that while playing you always feel like there's something new that's happening- something weird that just randomly decided to show up. This game feels like an on-rails shooter in comparison, and while the atmosphere is very good, there's just nothing bringing me back.\n\nSo all this being said, why am I recommending Dreaming Sarah? Well, on sale it's definitely worth it just for the experience, and I think the developer has a lot of potential in the future. The graphics are very eye pleasing (no pun intended) and the OST is pretty dang good (and you get it for free with purchase of the game) and if worst comes to worst you can sell the steam trading cards or keep them for a cool looking emoticon or background (most of them being well made, I'm wearing one on my profile at time of writing).\n\nOverall: 6.8/10","March 13, 2015","true","2.0"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","45","50","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/recommended/296870/","linibot","Lin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linibot/","556 products in account","A surreal little side scrolling adventure platformer, with minimal platforming elements and lots of exploration through weird but well made and definitely dream-like 16bit imagery.\n\nI'm slowly realizing that I'm bad at these exploration type games. There is a certain amount of patience required to get lost in its weird maps that go all over the place, in two directions or even looping onto themselves, and that require you to revisit them after finding certain items to see whether something new has unlocked. I'm apparently also not great at solving a couple of its slightly more abstract, lateral-thinking-required puzzles, so yes, a walkthrough was consulted. However, the game is good at creating a sense of controlled bewilderment that makes the exploration interesting, most of the puzzles do seem to resolve themselves after a bit of exploration or trial and error, and the different locations were distinct enough to keep fascinating even after getting lost in them for the n-th time. It helps that the game isn't particularly long (about 2-3 hours, depending on how lost you get), so frustration is kept at a minimum.\n\nI will avoid spoiling any of the discoveries you can make within its fragmentary (and admittedly not super original or particularly deep) story, because it includes some really interesting/shocking moments that carry the minimal, up-for-interpretation narrative forward. But I can say that Dreaming Sarah never got boring, because wandering through these dream sequences manages to stay refreshing throughout, with a new little surprise around every corner. The beautiful soundtrack also elevated the experience, and if you like this type of ambient, dreamy music, you will enjoy it.\n\nIf you are even mildly curious about this game, and if you have the patience to get lost within its interesting surreal world, then Dreaming Sarah is definitely a game I would recommend. Despite not being the main target audience, I enjoyed myself.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/296870/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","Note: video review embedded below.\n\nDreams are a rare occurance for me. Going to sleep usually causes me to fall into complete emptiness, or hover just between alert and unconscious as I struggle not to wake myself up. When I do dream though, it’s because something is wrong. When I’m feeling scared, or guilty, or anxious, these feelings manifest themselves in vividly internalized strangeness that often cause me to wake suddenly in a sweat, and then just as quickly slip away as I attempt to recall what happened.\n\nDreams are not fun excursions into my imagination the way they seem to be for many, but torturous self examinations without the constraints of logic and reality. I become my own worst enemy, helpless to suppress the ideas twisting themselves into things I can’t begin to describe even to myself as I wait and hope it will soon be over. My dreams have been this way for as long as I can remember, at some points during my childhood becoming so bad my religious family began to think I was possessed and mentally unstable.\n\nIt has been a long time since I’ve had anything quite so graphic as when I was a child, but that didn’t stop me revisiting these moments I had thought I’d forgotten as I journeyed through Dreaming Sarah and its protagonist’s equally bizarre and terrifying visions. Dreams are common fodder for media, but Dreaming Sarah is one of the first I’ve experienced that so perfectly illustrates the merging of reality and the surreal, and the petrifying helplessness within it that has been haunting me all these years. It exists at the point just between a dream and consciousness, where you can’t be sure of what is real and what isn’t; where your experiences and trauma come to life in ways you can’t control or understand, but are forced to make sense of or else allow them to swallow you whole.\n\nDreaming Sarah is excels at taking something conventional and warping it just enough to feel unusual yet still recognizable. Its artwork and soundtrack becomes continually more twisted as you travel deeper into Sarah’s subconscious, but always with a tinge of the familiar that only serves to put you more on edge. Gathering and using items feels traditional and expected, yet for what actual purpose I was collecting them I couldn’t say. Everything is so very ordinary but also alien, like you’ve been here before only now it’s changed and you aren’t sure how. Something is so clearly wrong, but you’re the only one that seems to notice.\n\nI wouldn’t describe Dreaming Sarah as terrifying so much as it is haunting and unsettling. There is never any real danger and I knew this the whole time, but as is always the case in dreams what I knew became irrelevant. This was a world of my character’s own creation but which plays by its own rules, leaving me in a state of disarray as I attempt to rationalize the impossible. I wanted to get out, but the only way to do so was to find a way to understand this dream and trace it back to where it came from.\n\nLooking at the dreams of someone else, whether they be but the creation of an artist or drawn from actual experiences, I was able to more easily see how they reflected some portion of reality. As I was helping to piece together Sarah’s psyche, it felt as if I was also in some way beginning to reconcile some of the inexplicable terrors I had conjured up over the years. It was clear that Sarah wasn’t insane, but that she had suffered and was hurting, and these dreams were the only way left for her to compartmentalize and begin to move past her trouble. Perhaps then my nightmares can similarly teach me something about myself, and help heal the subconscious wounds still eating away at me at night.\n\nIt seems likely to me that there will be people who don’t “get” Dreaming Sarah, who perhaps enjoy it on a mechanical and artistic level, but who see any deeper meaning as being fabricated or pretentious. Perhaps that is true to a point, but it also seems to say something about how we often view dreams as only that, rather than an extension of our real life experiences and potentially even a coping mechanism. I want to believe the horrors I’m inflicting upon myself are there for a reason, and that there is an ending in which I’m no longer tearing myself apart from deepest corners of my mind. At the very least, it would seem I’m not the only one.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4QoleIN5ZE\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","34","43","2","0"

It certainly stands on it's own two feet (and I additionally enjoy that you are capable of discovering why Sarah ended up where she did).\n\nNow, explorative puzzle platformers are not for everyone, but it is a nice game for those, that want to immerse themselves in it for a little while and just spent a bit of time relaxing and exploring.\n\nVisuals and especially sound are really nice and I am super happy that the game comes with the OST, because Anthony Septim did a really great job at giving it the musical accompaniment it needed, to bring this familiar yet odd world to life.\n\nNow, the game is quite short (albeit with a nice variety of settings), and the length is only buffed out by how quick you are able to find everything you need, as it is often with such games.

The fact that you're not told what to do once you start playing is quite intriguing and fun. You're being thrown into a world, the only information given to you about the main character is that she is in a coma and you need to wake her up. As you delve deeper and deeper into the game, you pick up items to help you go through certain "obstacles". I, for one who am not a "Super-Hardcore-Elite-FPS-MOBA-MMORPG" gamer, enjoy the simplicity of the mechanics of the game and I believe the developers did a good job even though there are still a few tweaks and bugs that need to be settled with.\n\nI would also recommend that you plug headphones/earphones in to listen to the surreal music composed by Anthony Septim and try to play it when you have some free time or when no one is around you. It really brings you into the world of Sarah and the puzzles she goes through. Septim managed to capture the atmosphere of each "dimension" you go through whether it be sending shivers down your spine or putting you into a melancholic lullaby.\n\nAll in all, I loved the game and the story.

It litterally dosnt tell you where to go or what to do. By defualt my controller didnt work with the game, something i would expect for a platformer.\n\nBedide that, the game is pretty fun and well made, it had quite a few enjoyable moments.\nYou can tell the developers put a lot of effort into making the game fun and vaired, you can find a paint bucket that will let you change the color of your outfit.\nThe pace of the game seems quite slow with a lot of backtracking needed. This is broken up with quicker events such as precise platforming or climbing a level, trying to advoid the rising lava.\nAlthough backtracking is pretty much forced upon you it's not too bad as the levels are well designed visualy and are astetically pleasing, and there are power ups you can gain such as a magnifying glass that lests you shrink, this will let you get into smaller areas that you couldnt reach the first time you were there.\nThe music is decent and matches the mood of the game.\n\nWould I recomend this game? yes","June 30, 2014","true","0.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Naturally this involves being harangued by a pirate in the middle of a desert, falling through the inside of a giant grandfather clock, and accidentally causing a massacre in a nightclub populated by aliens. (At times "Dreaming Sarah" almost plays like a journey through a magic-mushroom fiend's dream journal).\n\nThere's no real plot to speak of, other than the coma thing, which is spoiled in the Steam description of the game and not really integral to the game experience anyway (hence the lack of an alert in this review). The joy of "Dreaming Sarah" comes not from the sliver of a story but rather from the little throw-away surprises in its short, stream-of-consciousness levels (what is UP with that happily undead manor-keeper anyway?), the charm of the 2-D retro graphics, and above all from the excellent musical score by Anthony Septim (included with the game). The modern vibe of Septim's ambient/trip-hop score provides a nice counterpoint to the old-school graphics and gameplay (one button to jump, one button to choose an inventory item), and dispels any hint of tedium from the game's central exploration mechanic.\n\n"Dreaming Sarah" runs about 2-3 hours, depending on how lucky you are in finding hidden objects and doors. I used it as a way to chill out after playing through heavier stuff (again, the music played a big part in that). It's fun, cheap, creative, has a great soundtrack, and comes with trading cards -- what more do you want for six bucks?","April 19, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Inspired by Japanese psychological/horror indie game Yume Nikki, it has a similar feel. Other than the obvious being that they are both exploration games taking place in a dream world, both have surreal music, at times disturbing art choices in character design, and a female protagonist with no dialogue. Also, both have artifact collection, with the game ending basically when you finish collecting all of them.\n\nWhereas I enjoyed this game, I did feel as though it was just a lighter, more simplified, version of Yume Nikki in a lot of ways. Although they share many characteristics, Dreaming Sarah lacked the same amount of depth, and did not do much in adding to the genre.\n\nThat being said, the creator is upfront about it being a major source of inspiration for him, and there is at least one easter egg of Madotsuki's shirt's symbol on a bulletin board in one of the locations (there might be more, but I was giddy to find this one).\n\nFor the price it's being sold at, I would recommend this game. It's fun, doesn't have any boring tutorials, and most of all is an experience in surrealism that toys with your psyche.\n\n\nPros:\n- Gameplay was simple and easy to get into\n- Puzzles/exploration wasn't too dumbed down\n- Character and level designs were interesting\n- Good music\n\nCons:\n- Didn't add anything to the genre\n- A little glitchy","August 3, 2015","true","2.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On your way of exploring this odd and bizarre little dream world, you’ll discover a colorful cast of characters, and explore odd but nicely detailed areas like a mansion, a lava world, and a never ending desert. You’ll start off in a forest section of the game, and slowly find more and more items along the way which help you get to other areas on other parts of the world. For example, you’ll find a magnifying glass which will help you get to other areas by shrinking yourself, or you’ll find glasses which let you see items you normally couldn’t see and so on. Some characters you come across also require certain items which will help you progress, while other characters are there simply for world building. One of the character we particularly found funny was a skeleton in the mansion area. During their text, we pictured them with voices similar to the Terry Pratchett animated movies. While some of the things you need for areas are obvious, it’s not entirely obvious or clear for others. For example, one character requires orange juice in order for the player to continue forward. However, it’s never really made clear the character needs orange juice. There’s also certain puzzles that we overthought in terms of complexity, when it was just one of those ‘we hadn’t done this, so that isn’t available yet’ types of puzzles. They’re in the game and annoying when they appear, but they’re not so annoying because you generally only find them when you’re about to or already have the required item. Some of the areas however you won’t need to access until a fair bit later into the game, like the Moon area. Despite this, exploring the areas and solving the puzzles was fun, and made the game fun to play as a way to winding down.\n\nThe game tries to play like a bizarre platformer like Yume Nikki, but it plays far better than Yume Nikki for the most part. It’s less bizarre than Yume Nikki as a result of this, but it’s also easier to actually play.\n\nThe only major parts of the gameplay to criticize is that there’s no real ‘dead’ stage to the game. You can fail at a puzzle or jump, but it never sets you back far enough to really consider it failing. There’s also the item problem where if you change into a fish and change back, all the items you previously had equipped you have to put on again. You also have a few items that you really don’t need to stop using except in certain situations. For example, you never have to really stop using the glasses you find or the magnifying glass to shrink you.\n\nThe game itself is short, but it’s as short as it needs to be. It took us around three hours to beat the game, but we also got stuck on a few of the puzzles, so it’s really more like a two hour game unless you have a brains like ours which contain string and some peanut shells.\n\nVisually, it looks quite nice. Some of the character designs and inspired areas (ala the mansion is similar to the castle from Castlvania II) look nice, and everything somehow still flows visually, despite having very different looking areas. Sarah as a character looks a little too simple, but the extra animation on her hair when she jumps and moves is quite nice. We wish some characters had more dialogue with animations, but it’s nothing too substantial to really complain about. Visually, we wish they used higher quality visuals, but that’s it really. It looks ‘okay’ as is, but could be improved. The scene at the end with the sunset really looked low quality as well.\n\nThe music is also really well done. It was fun to listen to, and (since the OST is free on Steam) we listened to it while writing this review. Some of tracks feel a little too simple, and little too low quality in terms of audio playback, but it’s certainly not a bad soundtrack by any means. It’s not quite the ‘listen to this while you work on something’ soundtrack like something from say, Bioshock or Fallout 3, but it fit the game just fine.\n\nThe controls were also fine. Switching items is kind of a pain when you get more items, but it worked fine overall. The settings were also fine as is. The controls are rebindable, there are multiple graphics settings, audio settings, etc. It’s fairly basic, but we don’t think there’s much more it could have that it currently doesn’t. As for the game, it was fun, and we had fun. It was entertaining, and we got our $6.00 worth from the game. The puzzles are mostly older style adventure game early 90s style puzzles, but they weren’t nearly as frustrating as that, and mostly worked in a way you’d expect.\n\nOverall, it’s a simple but fun 2D retro-style platformer with some fun and triply little elements. We wish some characters had more dialogue, and we wish the game has better visual quality, but it’s still a fun game. We did run into some glitches , but nothing that deterred us from playing or finishing the game. It’s a short little platformer that we enjoyed.\n\nPROS\n- Colorful cast of characters\n- Well designed levels\n- Good controls and platforming\n\nCONS\n- Low quality visuals and random low quality backdrops\n\nScore: 7.9/10\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is our full review for the game, the only difference between the Steam review and the one on our website, is we have pictures and text is easier to read and what not.

It is through them that we solve daily problems, face our fears and, sometimes, come to understand ourselves.\n\nDreaming Sarah accomplishes exactly that: in a pixelated and rich platforming scenario we dwell into Sarah's mind to find out what exactly is bothering her. But it isn't as simple as that. The story starts off unassuming, mascarading itself as just another adventure platformer with nothing new to add to the genre. That's just meant to fool you, for as the story develops one is quick to grasp that, just like dreams, the game offers so much more behind what can be seen at first.\n\nThe game is creative and confusing, eye catching and trippy – all whilst maintaining coherence between Sarah, "random" NPCs and inventory items. You will never get to know Sarah just by looking at what she does or the little she herself sometimes reveals. Her dreams scream of her identity, what she caries of her needs and desires, and who she envisions in her dreams of her past, her fears and her story.\n\nAll in all this is a solid indie game that leaves a short but sweet note at what dreams are, who we are in them and what one can be willing to see in if one looks deep enough – and there is hardly anything deeper that one's subconscious mind.\n\nI recommend this game for the good story, well done platforming, interesting NPCs, disturbing sights and meaningful details.\n\nI don't think the short length or the unremarkable music are big enough downsides to stop anyone from playing this, even more so when the first one is more of an upside than downside and the second one is not the focus of the game.\n\nAs much attention as this game is getting, I'm of the firm conviction that it deserves even more.","December 6, 2015","true","2.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I admit that if I payed the full price rather than getting this game on sale, I would have been upset.\n\nI have to reccomend this game, but know that you're buying more of a short little piece of art than a game that'll keep you playing for a long period of time.

You wander dream realms in an attempt to help her wake up.\nAlright, fair enough. So what exactly do you do in this game? You start out in a forest area and ‘wake up,’ though you have no real idea as to which way you’re supposed to be going. Pick right or left and start running. That’s pretty much it except for the jumping.\nDreaming Sarah is a surreal game. The levels are connected to each other in strange and bizarre ways, but there’s no real rhyme or reason as to what they are or why you go to them. The gameplay is fairly freeform. Run around until you reach some obstacle you can’t get past and then find some way around it.\nAs you play you collect various items, some of which are pretty darn cool. There’s an umbrella which slows your falling speed, a paint can which changes your outfit colors, a magnifying glass to shrink you down to tiny size to get through little tunnels, and even an item which transforms you into a fish so you can access an underwater level.\nIn addition to all the useful items, there are a bunch of items which don’t do anything and whose significance to the plot is largely mysterious. Basically just collectibles, but strange ones. I have no idea why I was getting them or what the point of any of them are. Supposedly if you get all of them it makes the ending slightly different, but I took a look at the comparison between the two endings and it’s hardly worth it if you don’t collect everything.\nThe main joy of the game is the atmosphere. The music is great and the artwork is retro styled, but very pretty. The levels loop back in on themselves, so if you go far enough right or left or even down, you’ll end up back where you started. There are NPC’s, but they don’t have much to say. Talking to them can be kind of neat and some of them have collectibles you can get from them.\nOn the whole, Dreaming Sarah was an enjoyable experience for me. It is very short though. It only took me about three hours to beat it and collect every item and secret, almost all of which I found myself with no help. It’s not very difficult for a platformer and there are only a few ways to actually die, after which you instantly respawn, so it’s not for those looking for a challenge. The gameplay isn’t really the point though. It’s functional and there are some neat things you can do with the useable items.\nAn atmospheric, enjoyable experience overall. I’d definitely recommend it if you have a few bucks and you want something neat.","September 27, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Within, you'll find things you'd only find in dreams - magical beans that can make upward drafts, mansions with things that can only be seen with special glasses, and the ability to turn into a fish. You'll only receive small snippets of story as you explore the area.\n\nThe platforming in Dreaming Sarah is pretty well done. While playing on controller it felt pretty responsive. Switching around items can be a pain at times, and you may often find yourself deactivating your parasol when you accidentally open the menu. There is a large amount of backtracking to do in the game, but it does generally push you along in the right direction.\n\nWhile I do highly recommend Dreaming Sarah to those who like puzzle platformers, I only give that high recommendation if you can get it on sale. At full price the game just feels too short.","November 30, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The different zones were vivid and interesting.\n\nThere were a few genuinely interesting/disturbing moments that were very much in the spirit of Yume Nikki.\n\nThe bad:\n\nThe creator acknowledges the inspiration was Yume Nikki. It borrows the plot, the tone, the protagonist, the gameplay. While the experience may seem fresh to those who haven't played, I found Dreaming Sarah akin to a mainstream recreation of Yume Nikki.\n\nDreaming Sarah attempts to be artsy and mysterious while still having a simple, happy ending. Before the player starts the game, they've probably read the two-sentence blurb explaining that the protagonist is a girl trying to wake up from a coma. This was a hideous mistake that provides two major spoilers: the game is a dream sequence from which you will most likely wake. I get why the creator wanted to do this: so more mainstream gamers would play past the first five minutes. And yet this both ruins the ending and removes the incentive for players to analyze and interpret the dream world. If they know it's all comatose hallucinations before they even install the game, they can dismiss everything they see as wacky figments.\n\nLastly, the protagonist was flat. Yume Nikki's protagonist was interesting because the player could probe her psyche and question her sanity as they navigated her dark dreams. Sarah took a more passive and indirect role. She never fights, breaks, or opposes anything. She silently accepts the plot coupons NPCs drop into her hands. She barely interacts with her own dreams, and never gives us reason to doubt her sanity.\n\nIf you want a short, easy, tour through Wonderland that will leave you with your feet planted firmly on the ground, this game may be worth your while. Otherwise, there are games out there that do the artsy and psychological aspects a bit better. Check out Yume Nikki, Dear Esther, and Year Walk.","November 2, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game begins, you wake up on a grassy floor, and off you go.  Why?  The game doesn't say.\n\nThere is no story here, and the game can be beaten in less than an hour.

It just doesn't make any sense as to where to go or what to do and why you are doing it.\n\nI don't mind games that don't hold your hand, but I still want an explanation of some sort as to why the character is doing what he/she is doing.

It has a lot of charm being an indie game, and the music is perfect for the different settings. However, there are certain parts and things that should have been looked at to prevent repetition and have less waiting time, and the compass was worthless sometimes. Why have an item that helps you find items but take away its purpose in certain areas? Also, it would have been nice to pick up where i left off at when i save and quit, rather than putting Sarah back at the very beginnning. The exploration is amazing nostalgic similar to the first Zelda game for NES as you never knew what spoils were waiting in every room.

The game tells you the basic comands but never gives you any hint as to where to go or anything. OK so you can go to either side right? But then, depending on the side you go first, things on the other will just be skipped (like I just found a fishing pole standing straigh up, but aparently, there should be a person fishing who would tell about an item that I already had found). Than you start walking around and suddenly find out that most maps are circular in a way, so if you go always to the same side you should end up back at the start (if you have the required items, that sometimes happen to be on the other side...).\nThen the problems begin: there ar quite a few repeated backgrounds, like sometimes you walk a full 3 screens with nothing to do but kep walking (not even a jump or anything), no colecting objects, no obstacles, nothing.\nI knew it was somehow about a little girl in a coma, but just because I read the store page, for all the game tells you she could be just dreaming at night or she could be in some king of wonderland.\nSome of the items you pick are quite useful (like the umbrella) and some had no use at all (like the paint bucket that changed her clothes color, never found a reason to use it).\nAfter a while playing I had no idea where to go, what to do or anything. And was bored from navigating repetitive screens with not much chalenge and no story at all. (c'mon a little boy who says "thanks for returning my hat, now I can go home" and disappears is no story and that's the most someone talked to me and no cuscenes or reactions ever shoed any fragment of story at all)\nSo buy it if you enjoy walking around aimlessly, collecting items that might make some sense or you might just carry them around without using for ages.","May 29","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The visuals and music are both quite pleasing, but they're attached to an essentially mediocre puzzle platformer. The puzzles themselves are generally simple to solve, but are throttled by tedious back-tracking and slow-paced exploration. The platforming itself is a chore with no challenge. At under 2 hours for completing all achievements, there isn't a whole lot here, but unfortunately by the end it already felt too long. Most of that time was spent running back and forth through the same areas, which lost much of their charm in the process. There are shortcuts revealed throughout, as well as an item that can teleport you back to the start, but even with that, traversing the small map areas becomes tedious. There's not much story to get involved in; the dibs and drabs of text that come out are largely disjointed and don't form any sort of narrative. Given that the game is a dream sequence that could be forgiven; if there were more to the game itself then the lack of story or character development wouldn't be an issue. Some older reviews mentioned technical issues. I didn't find any in my play through. I would like to point out that there is an umbrella in the game that lets you float around, which is needed for some puzzles but can be used everywhere. It's a pretty enjoyable enjoyable mechanic, and jumping and floating through each stage is the one nice break from the tedium.\n\nAs I said before, the art and sound are both nice, and are what initially got me to make the purchase. But nice visual design and soundtrack can't make up for the flaws in the actual game. I bought it on sale for under $3, but unfortunately even if it were free I would have been displeased, as the time spent was not really worth it.","July 3, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","0"

Otherwise, check out Stray Cat Crossing.\n\nDreaming Sarah is exactly that: A dream. Exploring feels like you're on a bad acid trip, you can't seem to figure out what to do, and everyone feels like a snapshot of who they are rather than a real person. Unfortunately, it's ONLY that. There's no story until the end, and even then it's minimal. No story means no mystery. No reason to anything you're experiencing. I DID like what there was to experience, but that alone wasn't enough to motivate me to persevere when I was eventually left clueless about how to progress the game. I just watched a walkthrough instead. It could be that everything I just said made you want to buy it more, but I'd wait until it's on sale before buying it, unless you  want to support the developer. For everyone else, check out Stray Cat Crossing.

Toys a lot with your curiosity for exploration but a few things are really random and you'll find them mostly by luck rather by thought conclusion.

It throws you into the supposed dream world of the chara you're playing as, not giving you any wings what to do. So you walk the vicinity, and you find stuff... and then at some point you notice a puzzle, and once you solve it, a new area opens... and then you walk some more... lovely sandwiched in Atari-like graphics and mystic ambience music. Toys a lot with your curiosity for exploration but a few things are really random and you'll find them mostly by luck rather by thought conclusion. Once I realized that, it encouraged me even more to walk around and try to find new areas, and oddly enough, every time I was stuck and got back at another time or day I found something new. On the other side, some stuff that's there and/or appears over time doesn't seem to have any purpose at all. I'm not sure if this is still in development (despite it saying Early Access but that's not saying much, some places have WIP signs for quite some time. Would be cool to see more content in this and maybe have an ending to the game... well, maybe it has one and I'm not finding it.

It has kind of a grim undertone while still being lighthearted, pretty hard to pull off but it's done well and fits the game perfectly. Huge credit to Anthony Septim. My favorite was the Manor song, and for such a small Indie game i'm quite (happily) surprised the soundtrack was so nice and peaceful.\n\nFor a pixelated game it's pretty well done graphically. I guess "picturesque" is the only way to describe it. It's fun to look at most of the time, and there's a looooooot of weird stuff thrown into the mix.\n\nThe game itself is fun, and it keeps throwing new things at you every few minutes. It keeps a really nice pace, the puzzles aren't incredibly hard and finding new areas isn't too much of a challenge, but at the same time you're going to have to search. Your curiousity is going to get you lost a few times. As I played along I would notice a new item that wasn't there before and say "ooo whats this" and click it, only to get thrown in a completely new area that I didn't want to go to. It's the perfect balance of being long enough for you to appreciate each area, while also not boring you to death.\n\nIf I had to compare it to other games, try and think of a mixture between Limbo and Pixeljunk Eden. That doesn't really paint a good picture but that's because this game is unique.\n\nIf you're looking for a logical game with puzzles and enemies, this game isn't for you. It's more for the aesthetic and strangeness, and that's why it's fun to play. Some people call this art, some call it stupid. We all have our opinions. I, for one, enjoyed every moment, and I added 5$ to my steam account so I can buy this for a few of my friends who I know will enjoy it.\n\nIs it worth 6$? Maybe not since it's so short, but for 59 cents, it's worth every penny.","September 9, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn't do cutscenes to show you when a new area/item/person has appeared so it's up to you to check everywhere.\n\nI played using Steam Link and an Xbox 360 controller. I had no problem with it displaying correctly using Steam Link. I did however have an issue thinking the 360 controller wasn't going to work with the game but it does. When you are at the start screen press the Y button and than the controller should work as expected. I don't know if you'd need to press Y first when playing directly on your PC since as I said, I was playing through Steam Link.\n\nI got all the Achievements but two on my initial play thorugh and after loading up my save file I found the two I was missing in a few minutes. I tend to try to explore everywhere so if you are that type of person you'll probably have a similar experience.\n\nAs long as the being dropped in a world and not being told what to do doesn't bother you I'd highly recommend the game. If that is not something you think you'd normally like you may still enjoy it as it isn't a long game and the world isn't overwhelming large.\n\nAll in all just a relaxing enjoyable experience.","January 3","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every item you find along the way allows you to explore further across paths that were previously accessible. While the core concept of the storyline is a serious subject, this game doesn't really delve too deep; it is all in all relatively lighthearted, focusing mostly on the strange and surreal.\n\nConcerning the puzzle aspect, this game is quite straightforward (I personally finished it in one sitting one afternoon). I imagine seasoned players of adventure games will not find much of a challenge in this game. Nevertheless, it was interesting enough to keep me going; the environments and characters were very colorful, the items were interesting, and the achievements were fun.\n\nI would highly recommend this to everyone who's new to these types of games (puzzle/adventure/exploration), it serves as a great introduction. To adventure game veterans, while it won't exactly be anything new, it may still be a fun way to kill a sunday afternoon.

This is such an enchanting game with incredibly beautiful imaginative art and design work and a score that matches the game's somber mood perfectly.\n\nThings to expect from this game:\n+ lots of running around to explore and figure things out (I was stuck a lot and I admit, I had to google some things which I did not mind at all!)\n+ Around 1-3 hours play time.\n+ Very subtle, obscure humour (which I absolutely loved)\n+ A linear story (you have to do XYZ or you won't progress)\n+ beautiful, atmospheric score\n+ incredibly imaginative art and design (possibly my favourite bit about this game!)\n\nFantastic indie game that works like a charm on the PC with an XBOX 360 controller.\n\nWhat can I say? I bought this game on sale for literally nothing because I wanted to get back into gaming and the look of the game intrigued me. And I didn't expect much but as soon as I loaded the beginning sequence, I knew I would love this game and I really do.\nI can only recommend it! :)","September 17, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Every item you find along the way allows you to explore further across paths that were previously accessible. While the core concept of the storyline is a serious subject, this game doesn't really delve too deep; it is all in all relatively lighthearted, focusing mostly on the strange and surreal.\n\nConcerning the puzzle aspect, this game is quite straightforward (I personally finished it in one sitting one afternoon). I imagine seasoned players of adventure games will not find much of a challenge in this game. Nevertheless, it was interesting enough to keep me going; the environments and characters were very colorful, the items were interesting, and the achievements were fun.\n\nI would highly recommend this to everyone who's new to these types of games (puzzle/adventure/exploration), it serves as a great introduction. To adventure game veterans, while it won't exactly be anything new, it may still be a fun way to kill a sunday afternoon.

I think I picked this game up really cheap in a bundle. I was pleased to find it an enjoyable, but short game. I beat it in a few hours. It should be said that this game is a little bit like a metroidvania style game, but there is no fighting. There is jumping, aquiring items, using them in certain situations, backtracking, and figuring things out. The game has a nice retro feel. I wouldn't say the game has much of a story, but it does reveal a little bit along the way in a subtle way. All in all, I enjoyed it. There are a few little secrets that are enjoyable to find. I would recommend using the walkthrough that is found on the steam community board if you get stuck. The person who made that did a fine job. Check it out! I would have enjoyed the game more if there was some action, but it was still plenty enjoyable as is. I'd love to see the next things the developer makes.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=409664727","May 23","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't for kids (even though the cuteness level of the game may suggest that), as there are some rather macabre discoveries to be made along the way. You're left with a lot of questions regarding the meaning of the dream/game, but that's to be expected I suppose.\n\nI would recommend buying this game on sale though, as a playthrough didn't take me very long and it has limited replayability as far as I can tell (I don't think there are multiple endings?).","April 21","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
