While this doesn't make this game unplayable (as of writing this), some people might experience nauseating or any similar effects.\nPersonally, I do indeed see some consistent flickering. But I don't exprience any medical-side-effect, at least not yet.\n\n\nTechnical-fore-words:\nIt is fair to warn right away that this is indeed a very "as-it-is"-release of the originaly year-2000-build of this game, which is also mentined on one if the first pre-title-images. So there are no build-in tweakings in options-menu for windowed-mode, resolution-changes, or various other "modern" tweaking-options aside wheteher you want to turn of the sounds or not most importantly.\n\nThat being said, you're going to get one of the least amount changes suffering re-releases on Steam, only chnage being that it works on (at least most of the ) moderm machines.\n\n\nYou're also unfotunately forced to use another 3rd-party screen-capturing / shotting-software since due the age and un-modified nature of this game, the Steam-overlay won't be working (at least by default).\n\n--------------\n--------------\n\nAs for the game itself, "Puzzle Station" is the non-product-placement "off-spring" of Ninai Games (before Detonium Interactive) of "Drop Mania" (which eventually was "remade" as "Super Drop Mania" for Gizmondo by "Fathammer"; then there's of couse the "Rampage Puzzle Attack"-variant also by "Ninai Games").\n\nLike the title suggest, this "Drop Mania"-variant is much more puzzle-heavy for the most part. But considering the simplistic nature of the game-mechanics (link 4 or more of the same color-blocks to "poof"-them), I for one can forgive this even if sometimes I'd like to just watch pretty explosions "without thinking" (I.E. playing without swapping the blocks with Ctrl-button).\n\n\nSo, is the game worth buying?\nWell,  puzzle-game enthusiastics, especially those who are looking for some older titles, this is quite a good and solid one to their collection.\nThat's pretty much all I can say about this game, for now.\n\nAnd who knows, maybe we'll see an actual new "Drop Mania"-game in future on PC.\n----------------\n----------------","May 2, 2015","true","0.3"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","19","21","0","0"

It's still fun to play and while it's a short game, I feel like it's worth the price at least for fans of puzzle games. It's not a long game though and not very hard either.\n\nThe game worked fine but as others have said the resolution is locked and it crashed when I tried Alt-Tabbing out of it. However it doesn't take many seconds to quit and restart and it saves between each level.","June 4, 2015","true","3.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

But this puzzle game I really enjoyed, it is surprisingly fun to play, although it lacks a few basic things to keep you interested enough to play it for hours on end. It has some okay music, and generic sounds. But for a puzzle game you only really focus on the music and game play.\n\nGame PlayWhen I first played this game it reminded me much of the old game Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine, with the similar style of game play. There are two types of mode in this game. Arcade mode, and puzzle mode. This does add a little bit of replay value to the game, but still only really kept me interested for about 2 hours before it got a bit boring and started to become a little annoying. The controls you will be using are Ctrl and arrow keys. I'm really not sure why they chose ctrl to be their main button to select things in the main menu and to use in the game. I did have a few issues with the ctrl button, for one it's right next to the windows key for me, and pressing that minimises the game. If you then try to go back on the game it crashes. Really annoying, and couldn't find anyway to change the controls.There are two types of game modes on this game. Arcade mode is basically connecting 4 of the same coloured blocks, that will get rid of them. Each level you have to get rid of a certain amount of blocks to pass the level in the time limit that is given to you. The first few levels that I played I didn't even realise that there was a time limit that I was up against. Obviously I found this out after a few levels, and this time constrain gets pretty tight on the later levels that you get into the game. There are a few elements to this game, that are again kind of similar to the old Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine game. There are brick type blocks that if your 4 blocks (or more) touch the brick block it will take it out with them, or they will fall if they are not taken out and if they have space to fall. If however there are solid blocks, they cannot be gotten rid of and doesn't have gravity to it either. These two simple elements of the game make this game get harder as it goes along. Along with the time constrain it makes it a nice challenging game that has a nice difficulty curve to set you into what the game has to offer, and doesn't drastically increase the difficulty which is really good for this type of game. The other mode that there is is called Puzzle mode, it is what it says it is. Basically you have a limited amount of turns to drop the blocks, and you must clear all of the blocks to pass the level. I felt like some of the later levels where way too easy then some of the levels before that one, this makes me feel clever but kind of defeats the object of a puzzle game. Both of these modes have a nice little kind of collectible, you can unlock different colours of like the hand held console thing that you play these modes on. Nice little feature.\nScore (Out Of 10): 8 - Good variety of modes, Arcade and puzzle, although in puzzle mode some of the puzzles seem too easy later on and too difficult early on. Also I would defiantly change the main button to select things from ctrl to something else\n\nGraphics/art styleThe Art style of this game is cute, and fits in with the whole puzzle game on like a old school hand held device. There isn't really much else to talk about for the Art Style of this game.\nScore (Out Of 10): 10 - Very fitting graphics\n\nMusic & SoundThe music for this game is not bad, although there is only one track that repeats itself over and over again. It really needs to be varied when it comes to the music because after about a hour of listening to it I decided to just mute my sound so I wouldn't have to listen to it anymore. As for the sounds they are pretty generic for this type of game, nothing else really to comment about or say.\nScore (Out Of 10): 6 - Really annoying music if you're playing in a long session, sounds are pretty generic.\n\nConclusionI defiantly recommend this game to puzzle fans, and people who don't even like puzzle games. I myself I don't really like puzzle games but enjoyed my time with this game. The game play is really fun and satisfying, and if you can get over the awkward ctrl button and repetitive music this game is really fun.\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Lot's O Giveaway's curator group here.","February 17","true","1.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

On a PC in 2015, it's underwhelming -- there's just not much to it.\n\nIf you actually played the original release fifteen years ago, then you might want to play it again for the nostalgia.  Otherwise, don't bother; there are better falling-block puzzle games.","July 5, 2015","false","0.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
