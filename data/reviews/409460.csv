"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/409460/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2818 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game was reviewed using a code sent by the developer/publisher.\nBlackfaun is a roguelike game that was released in early December 2015 being developed by a lesser known team, Wild Guess Software. Roguelike is probably my favourite genre just behind RPG, so I was really looking forward to getting stuck into this game.\n\nThe game play is very similar to most top down dungeon crawler games, you have a top down view of your character and you have to navigate each level and reach the defeat the final boss on each stage.  You have a regular attack (left click) and a special ability (right click); each of these will change throughout your run due to the best part of this game, the loot pickups. Your main attack will change in style, from single target damage, to AOE damage, to a more trap effect. Whilst your special ability can be all sorts of different attacks too, you really get to pick and choose how you play your character with the items on show in the game thus far.   As you kill enemies they will drop a sort of potion, whether it is health or mana. Whilst exploring you will also find experience orbs, these orbs also offer the chance to give you a random increase to one of your stats. I thought this was a nice little addition that really makes exploring one of top aims whilst playing.\n\nThe game starts out without a tutorial, I would have liked to have seen one explain what everything does, but it is fairly simple to work out, and of course, since the game is still in Early Access, it could still be added.  As you explore further into the dungeons, you will come across areas which have a shop keeper, allowing you to purchase access to loot chests using the gold you have looted. At the moment, there are only 5 or 6 item slots; I would really like to see this increased to include many other item slots, such as maybe an additional ring slot, capes, boots, and gloves. I think having tons of loot is what makes dungeon crawlers, and whilst Blackfaun has that, it would be just amazing to have even more!\n\nThe art style in Blackfaun reminded me very much of League of Legends, the bright colours and stunning looking environments just look awesome.  The animations of all characters and sprites are spot on as well.\n\nThere is an underlying plot to Blackfaun, I was paying attention, but to be honest, I wanted to just continue the addictive gameplay. I couldn’t get enough of it! I really see this game blowing up big time if the developers keep going as they are. I would love to see some sort of daily challenge mode introduced, or maybe an infinite gauntlet based mode too on top of the story mode.\n\nAt the moment, the game has 2 stages, which have about four levels in each of them. This took me just under an hour to complete, and it really left me with a sense of wanting more, immediately. There is definitely a lot of room for replay ability just going off the fact that the game play is so addictive. Another cool feature that has been included is that collecting achievements in game actually rewards you with more items in game too! This is the only game I can think of right now that actually does that with achievements, and it’s something more developers should be doing!\n\nI didn’t have any technical issues; I was playing at 1440p with a smooth 60fps at all times on full graphics. I was a little shocked to see the graphics options was just a slide bar, but maybe that’s just there because of early access, since it is a PC game, we really need to see proper graphics options though.\n\nTo sum up, even though Blackfaun is in early access, I can easily highly recommend this game. The last update for the game was on the 30th December 2015, so the developers are active. The retail price at the moment is £10,99 – if you are a little hesitant about picking up an early access title, you may want to wait for it to go on sale, but if you are a roguelike/dungeon crawler fan like me, I cannot recommend this game enough. I can really see this game being top-notch as the developers continue to update this game.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dingledots/recommended/409460/","dingledots","Dingledots","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dingledots/","941 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game was reviewed using a key provided by the developer and/or publisher for the purposes of an unbiased review for Your Game Source[yourgamesource.com].\n\nOver the past few years, many roguelikes (or roguelites) have been released to great success: Binding of Isaac, Don't Starve, and FTL, to name a few. Blackfaun is the newest addition to this list, just recently entering Steam Early Access. In Blackfaun, you play as a faun as she explores different dungeons on a quest to prove herself to her parents. Along the way, you will find treasure, fight enemies, and deal with an unexpected troublemaker. Can Blackfaun stand on its own, or is it another to add to the masses?\n\nThe gameplay can be best compared to that of Diablo meets Binding of Isaac. Using WASD to run around and the mouse to aim and shoot both primary and secondary spells, the goal of the game is to navigate the maze of rooms, reach the boss of the floor, and vanquish it so that the next floor can be unlocked. There are two acts (with a few floors each) that must be explored, with plans to add two more acts as development continues. While running around the maze, there is treasure to be found in the form of different weapons and armor. More often than not, these weapons and armor change the way the game will be played: some may cause the primary attack to become a wall of flames, while others might cause your armor to slow nearby enemies upon being damaged. Each item's special change feels meaningful and has to be considered when exploring.\n\nThe stats, however, not so much. The stat system feels confusing and ultimately ineffective. After killing enemies and picking up purple wisps, levels are earned and points can be put into three main stats: VIT, INT, and AGI. These main stats also branch out into three sub stats which are affected by both the total of the main stat and the items wielded by the character. The issue I have with this is that I never noticed any big change as stats were earned. One run I might pump just VIT, and the next I might pump just AGI, but in the end I felt like I was both doing and taking the same amount of damage. Even after equipping a few trinkets (which are unlocked by completing unclear objectives during runs), I still felt just as powerful as I did before I received the massive +110 VIT. After a few runs, the floors started feeling identical and the enemies felt predictable with only a few different variations for each floor. While the different spells provided different ways to go about the encounters, the encounters all felt the exact same. Much like the regular enemies, the low number of bosses per act (four) added to this feeling of sameness, despite each boss behaving completely differently from each other. That isn't to say that it feels bad to play; Blackfaun controls well and the gameplay is great if you're wanting some action without paying too much attention. If you're wanting an experience that is radically different each time you play through it, perhaps Blackfaun isn't for you.\n\nIn regards to aesthetics, the game looks quite nice. It isn't the best looking game on the market, but it definitely holds its own. The models of the characters and the enemies are easily distinguishable and nice to look at. The scenary of the mazes is also a pleasure to see, with both acts being distinct from one another. As different weapons and armor are earned, the character that you control can be seen equipped with them, contributing to that level of detail that isn't required but is nice to see.\n\nThe music and the sounds of Blackfaun aren't anything too spectacular. They're just alright. The music isn't bad at all and is quite nice for the first few runs, but after listening to the same track for multiple floors, I grew tired of it and wanted something different. The sounds felt the exact same way, especially after hearing a wolf whine for the hundredth time after you kill it. While not bad, they're not great, and in a genre that is supposed to pride itself on its replayability, I expected a bit more variety.\n\nOverall, Blackfaun is far from being a bad game. Despite the same feeling from multiple playthroughs and the mediocre audio, Blackfaun is still enjoyable to play and there's just something that is incredibly satisfying about slaughtering massive groups of enemies. While it may not be quite there yet, I believe that Blackfaun will be able to stand out after some more content is added (which the developers have been very open about in their Development Roadmap). If you're looking for a roguelike, keep your eyes on Blackfaun. I'm rather faun-d of the future I see for it.\n\nLooking for more reviews like this one?

(mind you, the loot seems only to be a drop from chests, which are from stores/in tilesets/boss drops)\nRanged attacks are what you'll be using most of the time, while your offhand can do things like push or shield you. (given whatever items you have at the time) This doesn't make combat stale, though; I found it to still be fast paced and enjoyable.\n\nI'll condense the rest into a list here:\n+ Bosses are varied and tough, but still easy enough to beat.\n+ Items are varied and feel strong, but not strong enough to warrant not trying a new weapon.\n+ Enemies aren't too plentiful but still enough of a challenge.\n- Enemy AI, at times, is stupid. The archers in the starting forest zone will try to place traps too close to you in the middle of a fight.\n\nI'd recommend this game and am definitely happy I purchased this early! Can't wait to see where it goes!","December 3, 2015","true","2.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","3"

Very happy to have gotten this game. It's in it;s early stages, and in a sense, so am I as I write this. Admittedly, it's quite a task to move around with ease (I'm using Keyboard/Mouse)...walking around feels like driving around in Grand Theft Auto III...that kind of wonky feel, yet still I am getting tremendous enjoyment from Blackfaun thus far. TL;DR: Comparisons to other games are much more blessing than curse; and the positives completely outshine the negatives. No regrets about getting Blackfaun, and lots to look forward to!

It was released (Early Access) on December 3rd, 2015 for $14.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nBlackfaun is a very easy to pick up roguelike RPG with a vibrant art style and simple control scheme. The game play is similar to that of the Diablo or Torchlight games, some even compare it to the Isaac games. The roguelike aspect sets it aside from some of the other ARPGs on the market, and it’s art style is whimsical and light.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nQuick to click – The controls are very easy to master and don’t require a ton of dexterity to handle. I would have liked the option to use a mapped controller or a controller scheme, but ultimately it’s very easy to control on the mouse and keyboard setup. The click to fire is pretty intuitive and it doesn’t take long to feel like you’re a pro.\n\nPick me up – I am a sucker for loot, so anything where I can progressively find items which improve my character generally suits me. I did find that it’s hard to understand exactly what you are benefiting from after each death, but that you get items regularly. The variations in loot are also seemingly deep and keep you interested in playing another life.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nIn the dark – Some of the various items or chests don;t give a great description of how they benefit you, this was the one are I found to be lacking, a clear description of buffs and items. The interface seems a bit light for this type of game and could include a bit more information overall.\n\nDifficulty Scale – It does seem that the difficulty skyrockets from one level to the next, this may have to do with how you build your character but I got melted in the second world as you see in the video. Leveling up prior to moving on seems highly important.\n\nI found this to be a fun casual ARPG roguelike experience. I think if you enjoy either genre you’ll likely have fun with this title. It’s in early access also which is always a plus if it’s plying well because the developers can improve on their already cleanly working game. From what I can see the development team is big on feedback and making changes to improve so I’ll recommend this one with flying colors.\n\nScore: Buy it now","December 12, 2015","true","6.3"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","1"

The soundtrack, however, is great and the story is decent enough to have kept me interested all the way through my first playthrough. I definitely enjoyed the game and will likely play it more in thedays to come. It's a great game to use to take a break from more intense MMOs.","January 20","true","1.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenebra/recommended/409460/","tenebra","Tenebra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tenebra/","149 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nIt is a very promising game I think. Ok, its features come from several other well known aRPGs like Diablo and Torchlight. But it's unique atmosphere and 'permanent hardcore mode' (you die - your game is over - no save, no load) will be a challange for hours if you have got free time but not so much you could spend it for a more complex game.\n\nThere are at least 2 main features which caught my attention above all. First, the gold worth much more than in Diablo or Torchlight. You don't get much gold, but that amount will be your chance to buy meaningful items and bonusos. Though you can loot fancy items for yourself, but you can gain valuable items from the shops as well.\n\nSecond, the talisman system is pretty much promising. It will be a great excitment if they improve this. Because with the talismans you could advance to other difficoulty levels and stand the chance against more difficoult enemies.\n\nAlthough, the game has got much to improve. The controls are not perfect and I was very polite in this case. It is easy to learn to control your character, but I think the developers had to make it more simple like in Diablo or Torchlight. Therefore I think they have to step back to 'only-mouse' movement.\n\nAnd the save system is not perfect as well. Several times I had to start over because I had not enough time to play further, and I chose not 'exit game' but 'main menu' buttons...\n\nAnd the level design is great but I think the 'dungeons' are still very empty. Ok, the loots will be much more challanging task to get, but unfortunatelly comparing to the predeccessors, it is the games weakness that there is no chests or other loot-able items on the sections of a level.\n\nBut this game will be fun when it's done I belive.

It's fairly raw in its current state, but the developers have added lots of "sugar" to make the game feel like a complete package. Even now, with some bugs and missing content, it's a blast to play. Based on how the game currently plays, planned additions, and recent updates I would recommend giving this game a shot if you're a fan of the genre and want to get in the action as soon as possible. Obviously, all the caveats of Early Access apply.\n\nPros:\n-Top notch art. It's refreshing to see an indie game that doesn't use pixel art, but still has high quality art and effects.\n-Great item system. Items change your build and playstyle every game.\n-Dynamic content. Rougelike elements make every game different and maximize replayability.\n-Rewarding. The game is very difficult, but when your build comes together it's extremely fun to melt rooms of enemies.\n\nCons:\n-Character Movement. Due to the 3D isometric style, WASD controls, and character animations the character movement can feel weird. You'll get used to it, but it can lead to some frustrating deaths early on.\n-Has bugs. Currently still has some bugs and you'll get error messages during playthoroughs.\n-Missing content.

Each playthrough allows the player the ability to play through a randomised environment, fighting enemies in new places, while levelling up a character from level one. It features some light role-playing mechanics, with some loot being gathered by players, but, in my opinion, not enough for the game to be called an action RPG. Loot drops sparingly, and hardly ever does a player get any, save when defeating a boss. The art style is pretty, and it's nice to see a fantasy game using a non-traditional race as it's main character, but at this point in it's development, Blackfaun feels as if it needs more content. It's a very casual game, with myself hardly ever taking damage. This can be seen as a plus to many, but in my experience, the draw of the rogue-like is it's difficulty, which Blackfaun fails to provide in any meaningful manner. Of course, this could come as the game develops, as the game is in Early Access. For now, however, I'd say hold off, as there are better and brighter rogue-like titles out there, that'll give you a much better experience for your £12.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/KLDTVI8PZlI","December 13, 2015","false","0.6"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","18","2","11","0","0"
