My main criticisms at the moment are that stats don't play that high of a role in the game. You winning a match is purely random. There are also times during a match you'll be asked do you want to attack the objective or help your team. At no time does it say if that was a good or bad move. It's not that it needs to state if it was a good or bad move, but there should be something like you helped your team fend off the attacker or the attacker killed you but your team mate killed them or the attacker killed everyone and destroyed the tower. The problem is just that there is not a lot of feedback of what you do right and what you do wrong.","October 16, 2015","false","3.7"," 84 of 106 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","84","106","2","0"

Features and mechanics are not fleshed out, game decisions rarely matter and seem completely random, probably due to lack of any type of visual feedback which is crucial in this type of game. Great idea, but poor execution.\n\nThe Idea of the game is pretty solid. The game is split into two parts, the first you get to take control of an amatuer gamer and turn them into a pro either at FOBA (the game's version of MOBA) or FPS. The second part involves leaving your old life behind and managing a team instead.\n\nI'm gonna break down into pro's and con's for easier reading :-\n\nPro's\nVery unique idea\n\nTurn-Based, the game uses an energy system that allows you to make a number of actions each day. (Can be seen as a con too, but I prefer turn-based for this type of game)\n\nAbility to stream to make money\n\nRuns on most toasters\nCon's\nLack of feedback from most aspects of the game. This is the biggest problem with the game that has been mentioned countless times to the devs but yet nothing has been done about it.\n\nToo random. This is somewhat tied in with the point above but outcomes of matches/tournements seem totally random, even if a similar strategy is used. This makes the game extremely tedious as you have no idea why the outcome is how it is. Stats, research, champ choices in FOBA and weapon choices in FPS don't seem to matter.\n\nWhile they did add some features that the community asked for, they didn't flesh out most of it out and it just feels tacked on. Gear is a great example of this, all this does is give you a passive stat once you reach certain conditions (basically achievements). Could have easily have made a PC shop that gave us the choice on what parts to purchase to increase certain stats or what not. Moving into new, more expensive houses, have zero benefit whatsoever.\nThe game came out of Early Access WAY too early. Unless you want a very casual, randomized clicker I would stay clear of this game until they flesh it out properly.\n\nUpdate\nSo it has been nearly a month since release and the game is still in Build 175, I'd just like to point out that this was the lastest build back in the 19th of April, a week prior to release. The fact that we had no new build on release, no patches whatsoever post-release and no sign of the devs in response to any of the feedback since then, leads me to believe this game will no longer be supported. :(","April 29","false","34.5"," 56 of 64 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","56","64","0","0"

I honestly think it was released to Early Access too early.\n\nThe core concept: A single gamer growing through the rankings, creating a team and eventually winning at the highest level is a fun idea... But everything beyond that seems to be mired in bad design choices.\n\nI know, that sounds unfair... but let's examine the first few minutes of gameplay.\n\nAlright, I've started a game. Oh, hey, my player has been randomly generated. Name, appearance and nationality. Well, that's okay. At least I got a name I can pronounce. Okay, so we play FOBA? We FOBA player now.\n\nHuh, this pick/ban phase is a little strange. There are three bans between two teams, and the layout makes it impossible to ban out AD champions. Huh. I guess that'll make more sense later on, when I start running the pick/ban phase myself.\n\nWow, these champions look a bit silly. Still, that's understandable, it'd take far too much effort to come up with a ton of unique champions. Hell, they're probably randomised too. Everything else seems to be so far.\n\nAlright, I lost the game. It's okay, everyone loses their first game. Especially when they have to play support. But still, I'd like to know more about those champions...\n\nWait, where's the champion info page?\n\n\nI think you can see where this is going... And it doesn't get any better. Nothing about FOBA is explained. All I can assume is that we're supposed to guess at how the game it played based on our pre-existing knowledge of MOBAs. Which is reasonable for a player like me, right?\n\nWhat, for instance, is the difference between a Chaser and an Initiator, or a Soaker and a Protector? What do these choices do to alter the game? NOTHING is explained about the results of your games, either in the soloqueue stage or in the later team stages.\n\nAh. The team stages. Okay, bear with me, this is gonna get a bit meta.\n\nPro Gamer Manager is realistic.\n\nNo, really. In PGM, during what I'll call the 'bedroom' stage, you can choose to NOT play FOBA, and instead play one of three alternate games for stream potential. (FPS, Troll and Minecraft respectively). This will award you quite impressive amounts of money from your fans.\n\nYou don't get money from streaming FOBA. Apparently MOBA players are stingy.\n\nAnd the best part? You can rack up way over a thousand credits in a single day while streaming, whereas you get virtually nothing from participating in the team stages... Hell, setting up advertising revenue or an eshop can result in tiny amounts of money.\n\nSo an HOUR of streaming can net you 300 credits with 500 fans via donations and subscriptions... But a shop where you can buy stuff with that same money, and have it go to the same place? That generates 100 credits a WEEK with a thousand fans. And this is at the stage where you can no longer stream for some bizzare, non-existant reason, thus cutting off your only reliable source of credits!\n\nThe funny thing is, that sounds realistic. A lot of the popular streamers (IE: The ones making the serious bank) AREN'T esports professionals.\n\nSo... The moral of Pro Gamer Manager is... Don't be a Pro Gamer? Just stream. Then you won't go bankrupt.\n\n\nThis game needs so much redesigning is a little bit sad. Here's hoping Early Access works. I'd quite like a good game based around this concept.","October 19, 2015","false","24.4"," 66 of 82 people (80%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","80","66","82","7","2"

This was only kinda true.\n\nThe first big problem with this game is the lack of things to actually unlock through research. In game dev tycoon you not only had over 100 game genre's to unlock and playwith but also Marketing strategies , game engines , graphics , physics engines multiplayer and much more features to add to your game. In Pro game manager there were very few things to actually research. in career mode i think i research like two things before getting the option to switch to career mode. In career mode theres like only 4 or 5 things there too except they make the prices to get them ridciolous when it dosent feel like they actually do much.\n\nMy next issue with the game is its random events and popups. 2 in particular i remember is Injuring my hand so my reflexes were damaged and a new headset that came out. You cannot use your money to buy new equipment so why bother telling me about a ♥♥♥♥ing headset that dosent exist for me to buy? I honestly think the whole reflexes thing is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t too cause i never see a difference even when they game says they are improved. When you had popups like that in game dev tycoon it was the result of your decisions. for example one decision is To release your old game engines to the public or to sell them. is you sell it you make money but lose fans if you give it away you gain fans. its that ♥♥♥♥ing simple and it makes game dev tycoon much better than this garbage.\n\nNext is THERE IS NO TUTORIAL? WHYYYYYYYYYYY. it makes no sense to not have a tutorial its jsut plain lazy. I have no idea what stats are good for what freaking role because it has no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tutorial. Game dev tycoon has a great tutorial it tells you how to mkae reports to figure out what people care about more in which game genres and which game platforms do better with certain genres. Theres too many things to put your stats into to not have a tutorial. You just have to guess untll you start doing better in games.\n\nMoney is also pointless in this game. You have nothing to spend it on except for upgrades that dont really do anything or feel like they are worth it. Buying a house is pointless all it does is increase your monthly expensese like wtf is the point of that? It dosent help you dosent add anything theres no point at all nothing beneficial of buying a better house.\n\nEven in the Manager mode everythings feels like a waste of time. i see my fans go up but your fans going up dont impact anything except money which besdies needing it for paying your players wages. In Game dev tycoon when you got more popular you got invited to interviews and even to E3 eventually. Something like that would make my fans seem they are better than just me getting more money.\n\nWith these things in mind in general i just never feel like im making progress in my 6 hours of playing. i see numbers go up and sometimes i win sometime i dont.  Even when you win championships you just get money its really lackluster to see nothing come out of my effort. In Game dev tycoon when you get popular you get newspaper articles magaznine articles , interviews and E3 showcasings and all that feels like progression because its a gradual rise to beign a big game developer. in This game everything feels the same nothing feels like the next level.\n\nNo achievements , No trading cards they just dont give a ♥♥♥♥.","May 2","false","6.6"," 50 of 60 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","50","60","0","0"

I was wrong.\n\nI can see the devs tried to make an entertaining title, but the formula does not work. In MANAGING GAMES you want to see that the decisions and actions you take, affect the outcome of the matches whether in a good or bad way. But when you play Pro Gamer Manager, the decisions you make, affect the outcomes in a really vague way or they don't affect it in any way and are unable to change its outcome.\n\nYou never know or are told (at least give us a hint of how the mechanics work for god's sake) how things are going to affect your results. You can pickup styles and different tactics but they are really vague on how you should use them and really basic. They try to make it simple but making it that way just takes away the whole experience of being a Professional eSports team.\n\nEven if the devs assume you're used and knowledged about MOBA or FPS games, it's difficult to figure out what to do in every situation, even with Trial and Error. I might be wrong if I say that the decisions you take as a manager or a player DO NOT affect the outcome BUT; when I played Pro Gamer Manager I always felt that way and, believe me, IT IS NOT A PLEASANT FEELING.\n\nI really tried to find something redeeming and have fun with Pro Gamer Manager, but either I haven't tried hard enough (prob not) or the game in itself isn't fun, probably the latter.\n\nIt also has some bugs that are not gamebreaking or really important, but they are really simple and basic bugs that kind of break the experience too (16-15 as a valid victory result on a FPS match even if it's not meant to be CS, can't click too fast on incoming messages or they will delete themselves).\n\nPro Gamer Manager defeats its own purpose as a game and a managing game, such potential wasted because of a bad execution.\n\nI wouldn't recommend to buy this game in its current state, it's basically not fun for me and I've requested a refund.","May 1","false","7.6"," 48 of 57 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","48","57","3","0"

The tournaments are absolutely random, my 95 star character (I assume this is the skill based system through which the game tells you your and other player's skill) would consistently lose to ~30-35 star players. When computers played, the biggest upset margin I saw was like 3 or 4 stars. The game couldn't care less about your skills in Playstyle, Focus, and Knowledge as I saw no improvement in the amount of games I won while upgrading them.

I would highly recommend and will edit as soon as changes are made since i can easily see how this could be incredibly fun , but for now , ill have to say this is pretty meh , and limit frustrating since each time you discover a part of the game or something you like , the game becomes somewhat unclear as to what you're doing wrong and what you're doing right , most of the time when i get good comments in game i will then lose all my games , and when all i hear about are other teams or player , it will feel like i was just underated. higher overall players on your team doesn't seem to do much when it comes to winning ( i won everygame with 4 x 50 overall members on my team , then upgraded to 4 new better players and started losing ). Also sometimes it feels like whatever strategy you're using has no impact on the way games go. Early in the game there is a development phase for your main character which seems like it didn't even matter later in the game. The easiest way to make money in this game is in the first half which is kinda weird since i dont think streaming the game should pay more than having an actual pro team ! A lot of minor bugs are also present which is understandable due to the very early stage of this game ( for example I was number one on the solo queue ladder and when i looked up at bjergsenx it would also tell me he is number one ). Most of the menus dont have back buttons which means you have to make decisions that can't be changed  after you change screen. The overall for other characters than yourself also dont seem to change which is sad when you spend time training and stuff. I will definitely be back to try this game in a while to see if it was fixed since I had fun , but otherwise this is pretty much unplayable. Hope to see you guys push the great ideas you had further and do some epic polishing on this amazing project of yours !\n\nSincerely\nJust a Hobo","October 17, 2015","false","15.4"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","35","47","2","0"

Many things that were promised were never delivered, but its still decent once you get past that it feels like the hole game is a RNG (which it very well may be). In addition there is no clear guidance as to what does what or what stats might effect what things.... All in all i am disapoionted that they rushed the realese and will still keep following it, but without more work its not as much a game as it is a beta/alpha with a great concept.","April 29","false","27.8"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","24","28","2","0"

My understanding is that she (the streamer) had teamed up with the developers to promote the game. Which was pretty cool.\nSo I played the copy I won for a couple hours. Is it interesting? Heck yeah! Is it fun? Well, depends on what you're lookng for. Right now it kind of plays like an idle game that you can't be idle for. You start a game or start watching a pro to increase stats, and just wait. Then the growth doesn't seem to have a huge impact on your playing. And things seem very vague right now. Champions don't have names, just graphics. You don't do the draft, just make some broad strategical calls, and the computer takes over.\nDo I think you should buy this game? Sure. It is worth $10 in my opinion, if you have money to try out small indie games. If you're looking for 20 hours of content, this game is NOT for you. It could be eventually, but it needs more development.\nI want:\nChampion names\nAbility to draft\nMore customization of my character\nClear growth in character with all the stats\nMore options than just play or watch\nA more interesting early game\nAbility to get in game money and customize room\nMore depth! Right now this feels generic at times\nGreat idea, guys! Keep at the game.

GET IT WHILE IT'S ON SALE!\n\nNow that that's out of the way there are still some gapeing holes, and I'm not talking about the kind your team leaves during a MOBA match. Mostly polishing, some gameplay issues, but everything overall is pretty neat for an early release.\n(WHY we still call games "early release" when EVERY GAME ON STEAM these days is an early release baffles me) but I digress.\n\nWhy you should buy it:\nSomewhat original concept... create the gamer you've always wanted to be not the n00b you actually are.\nUpgrades, Research, Customization of in-game in-game character a plus with more on the way from Devs. ( you are a gamer playing a gamer, playing a game.... Gameception, Check )\nAbility to choose how you play the game before, and during the game's game.\nIf you are a MOBA fan that loves simulation, you will fit right in.\nIf you are a simulation fan that is scared of DOTA2 and Russians, you will fit right in!\n\nI will update my review upon final release but so far so good. Worth it when it's on sale. Cheers!\n\n\nUPDATE: The devs are a small team of dedicated gamers and industry proffesionals looking to improve their game as fast and as best as they can. If you have any suggestion I reccomend e-mailing them at: developers@progamermanager.com     They respond quite promtly, 3 hours it took for my response. It wasn't a "canned' response with <insert name here> they actually ready the e-mail and the miriade of questions and concerns I had about the game. VERY impressive.\n\nUPDATE: 4/15/2016   WOW! Been with this game from the beginning and it is great to finally see how far it has come. Even MORE excited with how active the Devs have been answering and implementing many of the things the community was screaming for. The new FPS and Manager mode make the game infinitely more playable. Looking forward to many more hours of enjoyment!

I was a big fan of Game Dev Tycoon and this seemed very similar to it so I thought I'd give it a go.\n\nThe biggest hangup I have with this game is that no matter what, nothing you do seems to have any affect on the outcome of the battle (I only played FPS player and not manager). After I unlocked streaming and got it up to about level\n10, all options of genres to stream vanished except for FOBA and FPS.\n\nI bought both upgrades for the houses and they did absolutely nothing. I thought you'd get some better hardware or it would be easier to stay in high spirits and get benefits to gaming, anything really but no, nothing.\n\nI can't seem to get passed star level 95. I don't know if that's working as intended but you go into the league tournaments and you'll often get beaten by guys that are half of that of your level.\n\nYou can upgrade your hardware but the last one you need platinum gaming status and it seems pretty damn hard to achieve. Simply for the reason that you can win 1 map and then lose 10 in a row no matter what you do.\n\nYou have a rage bar that fills up whenever you lose a ranked match but I have had it up to full and down to nothing and I honestly can say that I see no difference in the outcome battles with this either.\n\nIt is certainly in need of some tutorials. I see other people say that there is a not of Counter Strike terminology in here and never having played it, I had to look up some of what they're talking about to get an understanding of what skill is supposed to do what.\n\nI think if they ironed out the few bugs that existed and made things less random or maybe give some kind of explanation as to what is doing what, it could turn out to be a really fun game.

Prematurely, as you'll find out.\n\nMany of the points below - written for an early version of the game - still stand.\nThere is little to no feedback, not even to mention explanation. If you are not aware of the terminology in League of Legends or Counter-Strike, you will have a hard time understanding without researching it yourself.\n\nThe game is a big grind for stats which ultimatively do not seem to matter. The results (winning, losing, stats) seem incredibly random, even if your team is half of the world top 10 players.\n\nI had a lot of hope for the game when it was in Early Access. I do think this was released way too early and the premature release hurt the game in the end.\n\nIf you find this review unhelpful, I invite you to tell me why in the comments. Will do my best to explain my verdict and would happily take feedback.\n\n##################################################\nOriginal Early Access review below: ##################################################\n\n\nI was thinking about giving this the thumbs up or not. I decided that I should go by what the game is right now, not what it can be, promised to be nor I hope it turns out to be. The game shows a lot of promise but what's in there right now has too little long time motivation for me to recommend it. (the ammount of hours played is a bit skewed in my case as I left the game open for a night and work day).\n\n\nThe game assumes you know a lot of terminology of League of Legends (since that is what the game is mainly taylored towards right now) and doesn't explain any of it.\nI've played a bit of MOBAs but never heard of an ADC in my life, because I haven't played LoL. Friends with multiple hundres (sometimes thousands) of hours of playtime in DOTA 2 and Heroes of the Storm didn't know either.\n\nThe game generally doesn't explain itself too well right now. There is no tutorial yet and your performance in the game is not explained.\nYou select a role (Top Lane, Mid Lane, Jungler, Support, ADC) and a chamption according to your role. There are types for champions (e.g. Sustain, Healer, Chaser, Utility, Tank, etc) but they are not explained.\nThere are mutliple champions for each type but you are not told what differs Healer 1 from Healer 2, except for the "Tier" it is listed in, ranging from "SS" as overpowered champions to "C" as competetively non-viable champions - though it is not explained why. This tier list changes with patches to the ingame game which is a really nice mechanic in itself.\n\nSelecting a hero oddly enough also takes place before champions are banned (in MOBAs you often have the chance to ban a champion for a game so the other team can not use it), so you can take whatever champion you want.\nA Win or Loss also does not seem to take your stats into account. Of course, a single player seldomly carries a whole team to the win but my almost maxed out stats didn't seem to have any impact on the outcome of the game. You are simply not told what you've done wrong nor right.\n\nIn order to increase your stats you can watch top players streaming the game, though Pro Gamer Manager doesn't tell you what you're learning. It doesn't tell you what stats increased, if you've learned something about playing a certain champion, etc.\nDifferent compositions of a team make up different strategies that range from a "Glasscannon", "FullAD", "NoInitiation", and "Balanced" to "NoDisengage", "Early Game" and others. None of them are explained so the player is expected to know about them, when they are not self-explanatory.\n\nAfter the banning phase (you take no participation in because you already have your hero selected) you chose a focus for Lanephase and Teamfights as well as a general Mentality. No explanation on what does what, as it is expected of the player to know. Your selected champion also has no impact on this, so you'll have the same strats availablle for a Healer as for a Sustainer.\n\nGame done, you're rated with a GameScore between 1 (worst) and 10 (best) and can see your Kills, Deaths, and Assists stats. Besides that and telling you if you've won or lost, there is no explanation. You can't watch your own demos in order to examine what went wrong either.\nThe next game you might win, you will still not know what changed the outcome.\n\n\nI'm a fan of "eSports" so I've sunken quite some hours into the game and still enjoyed myself. Ultimately, it was just grinding and looking at a circle fill up and percentages increasing, since there is very little going on visually.\n\nThere are a lots of areas that need a redesign and lots of bugs that need to be squashed. Having your own team doesn't seem to work too well and cuts you off from areas of the game (improving certain heroes, researching, streaming) for some reason. You also will not know what you're getting yourself into before starting a team on your own (which can happen way too early at the moment). Earning money seems a bit imbalanced, since streaming is way too lucrative right now (in fact, more lucrative than being a Pro Gamer).\n\nAll this is to be expected of a game in Early Access and I do imagine a lot of this (if not all) will see itself being adressed later in development but I can only rate the game for what it is now. The current meta of the game is way too impetuous, as very little is explained.\n\nI can't comment on the frequency of updates just yet. However, the lack of feedback is a common theme inside and around the game, since the developers of Pro Gamer Manager could communicate with their current fanbase a lot more.\nAs a player you are pretty much left in the dark about the progress of the game. So far, patches were posted (the last one was around two months ago at the time of writing this) in the News section but you get no progress reports.\nUpdates in the form of blog-like posts would be nice, maybe bi-weekly in order to actually know what they are working on as well as confirming they actually are working on the game. This will give players confidence and increase the amount of recommendations.\nA beta-branch might even help with bugtesting and getting feedback.\n\nThe Store page reads:\n\n"Pro Gamer Manager is currently under development, but releases regular updates. We are actively working hard on fixing bugs and adding new features and content. Early Access will help us to get feedback and suggestions right away and continuously improve the game until final release. Check back to see what each new update brings\n[...]\nCommunity feedback helps us prioritize our long list of planned features and focus on fixing the worst bugs and issues.  Thank you very much for your valuable ideas and your feedback that we are considering in the future development! We kindly ask you to submit your compliments, questions, criticism, ideas and feedback to this forum"\n\nThe participation on the forums is fairly one-sided. I haven't seen a comment from a developer yet, outside of Twitter.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed playing the game but I wouldn't blindly recommend it to others right now. Hopefully I will be able to in the future but right now, the lack of feedback inside the game as well as the lack of feedback from developers is worrying me, personally.\n\nDO BUY the game if you can spare the cash and want to invest in a promising game without any guarantee that it will turn into whatever you imagine. With Early Access, the risk is yours to take. Also buy it if you want to test it, there is no demo and if you play less than two hours, you can get a refund via Steam Support. Make use of this option! Maybe you'll like the game and want to support and fund the game along with the developers.\n\nI'll keep this game on my mind and will certainly change this review if I see improvements or feel my (our) feedback has been heard and acted upon.","January 22","false","26.1"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

Want to know what kind of play style works best against a certain kind of team comp? Too bad! Figure it out for yourself - which I can understand and would be a normal thing in a game like this... if not for how it seems completely random at times.\n\nIn order to consistently win I had to grind the hell out of my gamer's stats and that was when I was only in Silver, which, by the way, I could not progress out of - not because my gamer was bad(His rating was 84) - but because I ran into a glitch. I could not get to gold and I was in the top 10,000 in the world at one point.\n\nMy gamer was also on the top team in the league and I was replaced by a complete scrub who had 40 less rating than I did. This was near the end of the season too which made me extremely salty. I didn't even show up on the team's roster, despite still actually being on the team - which makes me think it was another game-breaking glitch. My team went from "thinking I was a good player" to completely hating me and wanting to replace me for no reason. I carried their worthless hides on my back for the entire season and they want to replace their star player? Get real.This happened on such consistant basis too- the only fix being leaving the team and finding a new one.\n\nSo why am I recommending it then? Well despite all of its glaringly obvious flaws, I enjoy the concept of Pro Gamer Manager and can see it has a lot of potential to be really good. It's an alpha people, flaws are to be expected and personally I say support this developer so we can see Pro Gamer Manager as a finished product.","May 21","true","8.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","89","8","9","3","0"

I was wrong. This game is plagued with unnecessary wait times to get anything done, a lack of any kind of explaination for game mechanics (Let alone nomanclature used for the actual games), and horrible translation and grammar issues.\n\nI played this game both from the solo career side and the management side, and neither of the two options are any fun. In an attempt to stretch out the length of gameplay an arbitrary unskippable timer was included with phrases such as "Your team won the teamfight!" and then a random amount of gold would be added to your team's total. This was entertaining or at least tolerable the first few times, but when you get to realize that this is the game, it's like I'd rather sit and watch a loading screen than play this game even a little bit.\n\nThis game could be so great! If the devs added some options to increase the speed of the gameplay, or to skip the arbitrary timer all together I would be much more inclined to play. The addition of mouse over tool-tips or any kind of explaination of the game's mechanics would also greatly improve the user experience for those players not familiar with the general concept of these sorts of games.\n\nIn conclusion, both core aspects of the game are flawed for different reasons. The solo career has no explaination at all for what you're doing, and the management portion is more waiting than it is playing. Don't buy the game. Or at least wait until it gets better.","April 29","false","3.4"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Everything in this game is RNG and has no actual value. litterally nothing in this game has a value modifier (sp?) and is completely based off rng. You want an aggressive team, go ahead play a season of aggressive build style and still get reports about your team is not being aggressive. you want your team to do troll picks, sure go ahead, you'll still get msgs saying your team doesnt like the current practice set up and wants troll picks. pratically everything on the finance/staff members side is a waste. not a single one gives you  more income (or value) than their weekly salary. your scout is worthless and wont give a good pick to save his life. on top of that, you must fire the role you're trying to replace, just to view potential replacements (ie that adc you want to replace, gotta fire him, just to view the crap list of people available or to sign the 5th support that your scout found). the teams stats dont have any value to them. despite putting 5hrs into this game, i cannot find anything that i enjoy about it (and i enjoy progressional building games like game dev tycoon). you cant see how much everything cost until its too late and you cannot fire any staff members (despite them being completely worthless). no back button, so even if you're investigating something, its already too late (ie your scout got back with a potential team member, gotta kick the person you want to replace, as you cannot view his recruitment page again, despite having no idea what role your scount found). money: your source of income before you create a team is great (and a bit OP), but once you expand to a full on team, you better pray to RNG that the famous hockey player wanted lessons from your adc, as there is ZERO source of income (besides placing in the top three at the end of each tournament). dont waste your time building your player (or his toons) into the top solo Q player, as it will be worthless once you create a team.\n\nrandom other nitpicks: no audio control, so you will be forced to listen to the Sims build mode music until you take your headphones off. spelling, its ♥♥♥♥ (i know mine isnt great either, but im just ranting and not producing a game). one save file, at least give us three so we can save different variations, when we're experimenting.\n\nI have high hopes for this game, but even at a discounted rate, its not worth it atm.","October 18, 2015","false","5.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","0"

I found out about this game through Letigress's Stream[www.twitch.tv] and thought I would try it out.\n\nThings I Would Like Added\nAbility to adjust sound levels\nCreate my own character and name\nLeaderboards across steam friends/global\nCustomizeable/Randomized room because it is identical everywhere\nMore of a background on "FOBA", "greatest game on the planet" doesnt describe it very well\nList of champions with stats/common role\nMore of a tutorial about what stats go into what and how they effect your player\nCounterpart to rage bar, ie. A happiness bar\nInteractive pick phase\nChanging room over time/awards won and placed in room\nPossibly a multiplayer feature?\nMusic that changes based on anger or possibly how the game being played is going\nThings I Do Not Like\nThe bubble popping sound only  comes up in one ear and is quite annoying\nBug/Error/Mishap\nVarious times throughout the game there are words that do not have a space, making it look cluttered\nThis[i.gyazo.com] needs to be fixed ("cant stop play it")\nFirst time clicking on a specialty while learning, the "book" just disappears and I have to click again for something to happen\nWhen you have all the specialties unlocked and try to unlock another, you sit there and cannot get out of it because there is nothing to click\nThings I Like\nPost game quotes from spectators is a nice feature\nGeneral feel of the game\nThe music is fitting and calming\nShould You Get This Game?\nThis would depend on a few things, are you expecting a completed game? Are you expecting a game that has no bugs at all? Do you want to have full control over this game entirely?\n\nIf you answered yes to any of those questions then I would put this game off to a later date where it is completed.\n\nThis game would be great if you wanted some relaxation time or a break from your current "high-action", "intense" game. This game is calming and can be a way to relieve stress while trying to achieve something or maybe even get a feel at what it is like to manage a pro player. This game is in a playable state and there are no fatal bugs that would anger you.\n\nConclusion\nOverall, this game is looking great for being in early access and I know a lot of what I have said is probably being developed or worked on but it would still look great in the game! I would recommend this game to a casual gamer not looking to get frustrated at a game. It has calming music and resembles some very popular games out there (Dota 2, League of Legends). I'd like to thank LeTigress for showing this game on her stream and the developers for giving her the game and opportunity to promote it!

As much as I want to like it, because I like the idea.\nBut the game basically is just rng slapped on rng, slapped on rng, without any possibility for the player to influence anything. Pro/Cons list at the bottom of the review.\n\nYou are given the feeling in the beginning that your decisions matter and the more you play, the more you realise that they don't. Not the slightest bit. And even if the game actually considers your choices and bases the rng on it, your choices still don't matter. There is absolutely no feedback why something worked and why something didn't work.\nIf you play the FOBA part of the game or the FPS part of the game makes no difference, it's the same thing just with a different name and different pictures put onto it.\nIn the FOBA career part you get to choose between 5 classes of champions which are divided into 3 categories themselves and thats about all the information the game gives you. If you choose to play the role of an ADC you have champions divided into chaser, burst and utility. While it might be self explanatory where those might have their strengths and weaknesses it does not matter which you pick.\nRegardless of the tactic, you might be doing extremely well or extremely bad. I've had winning streaks with miserable rated champions (which is another part of faking your influence towards the rng) and losing streaks with SS (which is the highest rated). I tried choosing tactics that made sense with the little information thats given to me and just to check, I tried doing the opposite a while. No difference.\nIn the management part, it is basically the same. You hire players and they win you games in the lower leagues because they level up really fast and dominate the other teams, but once you get to the tournaments, even with the highest stats on your gamers, it is back to rolling the dice and you don't even get the 50:50 chance you had in the career part. And again tactics don't matter.\nThe forum is full of unanswered questions about mechanics.\n\nThey announced to leave early access on 29th of April, about a week from now, and it still has bugs which are just horrible.\n- If you start a new game, you have your player stats from the previous game but your skill level is calculated as if you were a new player which leads to the problem that you can't get any better if you maxed your skills in the previous game (but actually why should one care about it, since stats are an illusion just like choices).\n- you can unlock different topics to choose from when streaming (one of the ways to earn cash). I unlocked them and they disappeared on me later in the game and I'm stuck with only two topics to choose from (in both saves I played)\n- my team display got bugged at some point which led to me not being on the team anymore even after moving to a different team, my name just won't show up and since then I wasn't allowed to participate in any team event (not even as spectator, which is one of the options when there are such events)\n- the most recent one (which led to me writing this review). I was ranked 4th, won a game, and now im ranked -27. It really looks like the devs didn't even think people would play their game long enough to get to that point.\nVery disappointing.\n\nPros:\n- the idea\n\nCons:\n- bugs (the game is leaving early access in a week and still has game breaking bugs)\n- no feedback on what your tactic/role/champion choices actually do (I'm fairly certain they don't do anything)\n- there is no strategy involved whatsoever, not from an economic point of view, nor from a tactic/team building point of view.\n\nUnfortunately it is a very shallow game and to make it even worse everything has a small clock ticking up. Thats so extensive that I would have gotten to the part where I am in the game in 2-3 hours (or less) if it wasn't there, compared to the close to 15 hours playtime I am at right now.\n\nIf you want a simulation other than complete rng in an esports environment don't buy it.","April 21","false","18.8"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

In the end I decided to recommend it based upon what it currently is as of writing this. This is a game with a really fun concept, with lots of possible potential, however at this time I feel the games execution is abysmal. You can select between LoL or CSGO, I picked CSGO because I don't like MOBAs. However it seems the CSGO options are bare minimum and much more attention has been given to the LoL portion of the game. That is not, however, why I do not recommend this game. That comes from the almost 8 hours I've put into this product and realized that your choices, your skill upgrades, your Hero/Weapon selections, everything you do is basically entirely random. Your rankings and stats as a player are totally meaningless, every match outcome is randomly determined with dice rolls, from what I can tell. Even if it isn't you would never know because the game refuses to tell you ANYTHING. There are no Tutorials, there are no Tips or Hints that are provided to let you know which choices you made incorrectly, no way of actually knowing weather or not you are making the right selections. I can make the exact same selections and get wildly different outcomes every single time a match occurs.\n\nThe game is also imbalanced in other areas. For example Streaming is by far the most lucrative way to make money, I make enough money from 1 streaming session that it equals like 7 weeks Salary from my Team contract. You can't really interact with anything within the game, it's just "Play Ranked, make random selections, get random outcome, rinse and repeat". You can watch Top Ranked players streams to "learn" how they play the game and get tips from this. However once again the game does nothing to imply what you've actually learned from watching them, from a gameplay standpoint all that literally does is grant you some Knowledge XP to invest into the Knowledge Tree. Which as I've mentioned has no real function and does not seem to factor into anything.\n\nThe game also has a problem with assuming the player (you) should already know everything, includeing terminologies such as AWLper or ADC, etc. I've no idea what these terms mean and the game does not care to explain, because obviously you should know already. The game is also littered with Spelling and Grammer errors. You are able to hire an Agent to represent you, and get better contract offers for you, however you are unable to do this unless you already have a team and have a contract already, which imo makes this rather irrelevent for obvious reasons.\n\nTL;DR- This is a game that has the potential to be something great in the future, but currently is an uninformative rock paper sicssors game where your stats and rankings dont seem to matter at all, and the game does not explain anything or make any attempts to help you.","April 24","false","7.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The premise showed a lot of promise, and the early Alpha showed a game that would be very addicting and fun once it was polished, added to and developed further. There were spelling errors, very barebones gameplay and little to no explanation for the things you did, along with no options for graphics or sound. But it was fun, and it was Alpha.\n\nNow the game is released and.... not much has changed honestly. A lot more has been added to it, but very few of its glaring problems have been worked on or fixed. The game seems to assume you have a base knowledge of at least the game types that are being simulated, and if you don't it is not going to do anything to explain what is happening or why. Graphic and sound options are spartan, actually playing the game feels almost as much of a grind as the actual games themselves.\n\nSpelling errors still abound, and despite the apparent polish of the game it is clear that not much resources were poured into, or on hand for this game. A lot of great concepts are left half finished ,and a lot of promised features just simply never were added in.\n\nThis game is a collection of great ideas that never really went anywhere.

There are little things that can be improved upon over time, and there are core functionality issues that are not likely to be addressed.\n\n-Manual game saves. The game does not autosave. I can't understand why not since you can't have multiple saves.\n-Acquring new players for your team requires you to drop a player first to open a slot. You may not be able to find a better player than the one you had, but you are still requried to drop the player or a slot won't be open to bring someone new on the team.\n-What the hell do any of the stats or choices you make during the FOBA games mean? The whole mini-game seems like random choices with random consequences.\n-Without being able to make an impact on the FOBA games it seems like unnecessary tedium to have to sit through all of the screens over and over.\n\nIn general it feels like you have very little control or knowledge of what is taking place in the game. You make a few choices and await an outcome. You then repeat this process hundreds or thousands of times. The game lacks depth, clear direction, or any semblance of structure.

But, seeing as it was on sale, I decided to give it a shot, and I have to say, it was well worth it. I found myself mindlessly playing this game for hours on end. It is not without its issues, however.\n\nThis game is about as close to the definition of simulation as you can get. If you are looking for a comparison, this game is very similar in design to "Game Dev Tycoon". You start out as a small, unskilled player of a game called FOBA (based of MOBAs such as LoL or Dota). As you play, you slowly get better at different champions, and can even start to make money off of your playing, but the real game starts once you create your own professional team.\n\nBut that does come with a few side effects. As of now, the game has no real tutorial (although I am sure this will be added in the future). After spending about an hour and a half learning exactly how to play and mastering the little details, it was a bit annoying to suddenly start playing what is essentially an entirely different game. The solo play to team play mechanics are pretty much entirely different, but hey, you get two games for the price of one.\n\nThe bulk of the game comes down to slowly moving up the competetive ranks with your team.You expand your office, hire new team members, and gain a fan base. My favorite part about the whole game is the team system. You can change exactly what each member on your team does in a game, and you can even set specific metas you are playing by.\n\nThe only real problem I have with the game is its lack of feedback. At the end of a match, you get a few small tips about how you lost and a statement from a specatator, but these generally have to do with specific elemtents from FOBA, not anything you can actually effect. And this is the only feedback you get. When I make a decision to make a certain play or have one of my teammembers slightly change their playstyle and lose, I have no idea what caused the loss. It basically comes down to trial and error.\n\nMany people have said that winning/losing is completely random, but I do not believe that is true. There are just a large amount of factors that come into play. The stats of your team, your meta, team matchups, team synerger, morale, roles, the meta you are playing. With all of this, it is easy to lose track of what you need to work on. I think a specific stats page after each game that gives you some explanation as to what you can fix would really help.\n\nOverall, this is a fun game. It has a few annoying bugs, and a couple flaws here and there, but that doesn't really hinder the concept at all, or in anyway break the game. After all, the game is still in early access, and only came out a few days ago for that matter. If you are into MOBAs, this game is a must have. Just wait a bit if you are worried about anything I mentioned.","October 17, 2015","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","0"

Saw the Negatives and thought, "im a seasoned VEt. when it comes to sims. Theses guys must not know how to play, etc." Well now I wish i could get my refund.\n\nThe Dev of this game had a decent idea, but the way the game works is flawed. Especially in "FPS" mode. In FPS you need to be able to control more aspects of the way your guy/team plays the game. Same in Foba.\nAlso;\n-The Way you win games seems like there is a patter but there isnt\n-The Lack of in game choices on both player level and Manager level is appalling:You have game swhere you do nothing in player or seemingly randomly switch between Aggressive, Normal, and Defensive in manager\n- if the basis for FPS is CSGO, then the DEV has never watched a pro game much less played it at a even a GN level.\n-Stats Don't seem to matter at all, nor is there a way to know what they do.\n\nGame has a good premise and seems to try a bit, but needs more interactivity. As it is now it is a button pressing simulator. No strategy, no brains, no customization, no thrill: Just buttons.","May 19","false","3.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It feels incredibly random and when you improve yourself, it's not exactly clear what anything really does. The game definitely needs tooltips and help for the various items in the game. Half of the time you're just randomly selecting things hoping they work out. Leveling skills seems random as well since you have no idea what they do or how they affect the outcome of matches.\n\nAlso your playstyle depends on the champion you're playing, what champions the teams are playing, and what champions the enemy have picked, and things like that. When you don't know what any of the champions do (or what they specialize in), it's hard to pick tactics.\n\nIt's a good concept and if they improve and build on this game, it could really be a good game. I think it could have been better with different starting points in life (e.g. High school student, college student, pro-gamer, manager, etc.) and have to manage work/life/gaming balance. It would also be nicer if you could create a schedule to do something instead of relying on "energy". For example, a high school student would have to go to school (but they could be given options to skip class with a risk of getting caught and being grounded) and study (they have to maintain a certain scholastic achievement level to be able to play) and in their free time they play games and get skills. Perhaps that level of development is for a sequel or a later iteration.\n\nThis game has a lot of potential, and for that I give it a slight "yes" recommendation. If the developers give this game some attention and improvement, they can easily win over some of the negative reviews and get some of the skeptics to cross over.\n","April 30","true","4.3"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The first part of the game was alright fun, where you're able to play, stream, watch pros, research etc. But once you expand and get a team, the game completely falls apart.\nThere's no longer any proper way to make money, which means if you saved up to expand and were left with very little, then it's basically game over.  Restart.\n\nThey have removed any option to improve your character after you have a team, you can't even play for a full week while recruiting a team.\nOnce you have your full team, you can play one game a day, which is also randomized, and doesn't seem to take into account anything you did in the first section, such as mastered champions etc.\n\nOverall this game needs a LOT of polishing to be enjoyable.","October 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

THE GAME IS BROKEN AND AN UNENJOYABLE FIRST EXPERIENCE.\n\nOnto the review.\n\nYour champion/character picks don't mean anything since their role means nothing, their position in the meta or OP Chart means nothing since it doesn't impact matches, and you can't dictate anything in the middle of the game.\n\nThe Pick/Ban phase is useless, since you chose your character prior to the actual select (which nobody would do), and you can't improvise mid game to change playstyle. You do nothing for your character, you can't see what's going on, you can't post-analyze the match, and you can't give your person/character an area to work on.\n\nChampion mastery is also irrelevant. When I select a character who I have never touched before I have a higher winrate than a champion I have spent most of 4 hours working on.\n\nThe FPS category is irrelevant since there's literally nothing there. Just some icons.\n\nManaging a team was fun until your players started underperforming for no reason, with no statistical proof of lack of ability to play the game, and you can't negotiate or haggle using contracts with players so you're often stuck with a level 2 mid laner in a team where everyone is level 80+. (I know they don't have levels, it's just easier to explain using such lingo).\n\nMy biggest pet peeve is that the character mean nothing. Literally nothing, they're just icons with smaller icons in the top left corner. They don't have pros, cons, weaknesses early, weakness late, magic or physical damage reference, and in general mean nothing. This means that you can't really help your "team" when they ask you for a single target burster. What? Does this fairy thing do burst damage, aoe damage, or does this dragon heal? There is no explanation to characters.\n\nTL;DR This game is a shell and technically shouldn't be an early access game since this isn't a game right now. But I very much like the concept and it would be awesome to manage a character that you love and want to improve and win the FOBA (whatever that stands for) world championships.","February 4","false","9.9"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

But the game is missing so much, so many features. I'd like to start off with the lack of documentation in the game, nothing is explained, you have to figure everything out on your own, which after a while makes you believe that everything is running on random chances, because you can be the best player in the tournament, but still loose in the first stage. There's too much griding in the game, if youre in a team and you play a team match it might be a week until you play another team match despite in manager mode your team plays a game every day.\n\nThere's a lot of bugs to be fized in the game, for example winning an fps match 16:15 (Unless thats a feature?), or loosing the tournament in the second stage yet still getting the prizes. Loosing a cup but still qualifying for the mayor. The list goes on.\n\nI'm not riping into the game just hoping to make you guys aware of the state of the game and just to provide some contructive criticism for the game developers.

They all seem strictly random to whether you win or not regardless of what tactics you choose..\n-when you're several stars higher than the other players in your pro team, they pick players at a much worse skill level over you.\n-When you're in a pro team, the league standings don't change at all when your team wins or loses.\n-Some of the grammar in the texts that come up are not proper english and don't make sense.\n-When you have a team meeting, whatever you suggest or say to the team leader, nothing happens. The leader seems to not even consider anything you've said.\n-Weapon mastery seems to have no impact on your overall game/performace as every game seems to have random results.\n-In manager mode everything is glitchy such as the B team which all you can do is buy and it sorts itself out, no interaction whatsoever.

It seems really promising but there are just so many bugs.\n\n-Lost a player that i recruited because i didnt know I had to remove somone on my team before i gave them a contract.\n-When you buy upgrades you dont know what they do until you purchase them and then a screen pops up telling you.\n-If you go to the recruit player screen and then back out without recruiting someone it wont let you go back and recruit.\n-Some of the text went off the screen.\n-I used cheat engine to see if it mattered what players you had on your team, it doesnt. Winning is all RNG.\n\nOther than bugs it just seems broken once you get a gaming house. You cant stream from there so there is no way to make money once you buy it. The only way i can see not going bankrupt is if you stay in the first stage and just build up a crap load of money. Also I dont get why you can only recruit one player a day. Another thing I found irritating was that you couldnt hire the staff in the order you wanted, you have to unlock them in a specific order. This made it very difficult to make any money once you got to the gaming house because you have to pay all these high salarys well literally having no way to make money inbetween games.\n\nThings I feel should be added\n-Sound controlls and back buttons for every screen\n-A screen that tells you how to get each stat up\n-When prompted to make a decision in a game, I would like to know what came of it.\n-The ability to practice a champ and stream at the same time.\n-The ability to stream from your gaming house when you get there\n-When recruiting players there should be a tab for each role instead of having to come back everyday until a ADC appears on it.\n-The ability to still work on your charcter once your at the gaming house.\n-The ability to name your charcter and team.\n\nOther than that i really did enjoy the game and i think the concept is amazing. The thing is its riddled with bugs and once you get to the gamming house the game becomes unfun. Im still salty about playing for three hours and then going bankrupt when i had 2 grand in my bank. Still not sure how that happend. I'll check the game out again in a month or two to see if they get this stuff fixed.","October 18, 2015","false","5.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Here is a list of things that bother me and must be fixed:\n\n1. There are a lot of grammar mistakes who make this game silly and childish("i think' 'cant"). These should be adjusted accordingly. It's not really a bug, but would make the game better and more enjoyable.\n\n2. The game doesn't have an autosave feature and I've lost my progress 3 times already due to a bug that lead to the game crashing. What happened is that I fastly opened and closed the mailbox(2 fast clicks on the icon) and the game froze so I had to ALT-F4 it.\n\n3. The pick/ban phase is TERRIBLE! You always get the pick you want and the role you want, although that never happens in a MOBA, plus, teams ban while players are picking, which should not happen(you ban before you pick).\n\n4. During your player career, you can't really see the stats of your team, nor can you see its real league. For instance, I've signed with several FOBA Amateur League #4 and #1 teams, but when I checked "Standings", we were playing in the #7th league. Also, if my team wins a game, we don't get points, therefore we don't advance in standings.\n\nMoreover, in FPL(the professional league), Team X is always second(same problem with points gain)\n\nAlthought it was mentioned in another review, I think it's necessary that I also mention the fact that you don't get any tips on how to improve your game after a loss, or even a win. You don't know if the tactics you chose affected the game, how they affected it and whatnot. For instance, what if I am playing an utility champion, but my team is "EarlyGameTeam"? Did I lose the game because I chose a passive mentality just because I found it suitable for my champion playstyle? Would I have impacted the game more with an aggressive mentality, attempting risky plays?","February 17","false","19.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Painfully repetitive.  The other sounds are beyond simply uninspired to the point where they sound like they were taken from old Fisher-Price baby toys.\n\nThe game has very little depth to it right now.  Most of the time you are literally just watching the same boring animations over and over.  There's no transparency to what's going on and while you do improve over time, it never feels like it makes any difference what you do.  You just will improve over time.\n\nBut then there's the dev's shockingly bad choice to force the player to start as a support.  Not only is this unrealistic, it demonstrates how badly the dev understands these games.  Support is not the trash position you throw newbies into.  And paying 45k dollars to learn another role?  What?  lol\n\nAt this point, save your money.  There's nothing to do in the game, it's boring to look at and painful to hear.","January 8","false","4.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

However, I know close to nothing about MOBAs, so the game concepts themselves were very confusing to me. The lack of any kind of tutorial or explanation of the various terms that the game uses really didn't help; I had literally no clue what was going on the entire time. What does "Jungle" and "Toplane" and "Midlane" mean?\n\nMaybe worth it if you're a MOBA player who likes tycoon-type games.

They smush tons of different stats in your face and expect you to just go with it. Basically you'll just randomly pick and choose crap until things work for you, but you don't really know why they work. This game is not a simulation. It's a random number generator where you can sometimes, randomly reduce or increase the range of numbers to reduce/increase your odds of winning.\n\nLearning doesn't give any meaningful advantage or insight into progression. Choosing different strategies seems to change very little. The champions all look extremely generic and I'm not sure if each one even changes anything. I mean honestly, this game is as far from sensical as you can possibly get. There is probably no amount of tutorials that will help this game make sense.

I actually am in the process  of figuring the game out. Yes you have to learn this game the old fashioned way through trial and error. However UI is not intuitive but again, if you have time, you can learn the UI and figure out what is the best tatics for your in-game avatar.

If you are looking for a clean and polished up game, this is not for you, but if you're willing to bear through the bugs and glitches of this game, it can be quite fun. And all of the reviews out here say it is entirely based on RNG, that is partially true, but there is still an aspect of strategy to it. For example if I am playing support on an Early Game Team vs. a Full AD Team, I would choose to go aggressive and harass the enemy team in laning phase, becase we have the early advantage, and protect the frontline in teamfight where we are weaker. (When I played this in game I got a 10 and we won.) But, if in that same scenario I had choose to go passive and stay with my ADC in lane, and split the enemy team in teamfights, we would get destroyed.(When I played this in game I got a 2 and we lost.)\n\nNow here are some pros and cons to this game according to me:\nPros\nRelated to other games we know and love (CS:G0, LoL, Dota2, HotS, etc.)\nRelaxing, no stress\nRuns on toasters\nVery different options you can go (FPS, "FOBA")\nActive Dev Team, pumping out updates\nNice MusicCons\nBroken English\nNo tutorial (coming soon though)\nRNG based\nLots of grinding\nSingle-player (multi-player coming soon)\nIn conclusion I would only buy this game if you are looking for a long term investment, that will get better as the months go on. This game just needs a bit more polishing up, and then I believe it will be much better.","May 3","true","3.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","2"

Pro Gamer Manager. Wherein you take the control of a Pro Gamer wannabe with grand aspirations. What I’m going to talk about is a few reasons you should buy the game, and a few reasons you probably shouldn’t. Please note, I don’t have an affiliation with the developer Millenway Studios, this is all from personal experience from game time I’ve had after release which, as of recording is about a day. There may be some words, or terminology that require understanding of MOBA’s in general, if you don’t have that understanding please, ask me to clarify, and I’d be happy to do so.\n\nSo first off, the game is reminiscent for those that have played a game dev type game. It’s $9.74 USD currently. The first mark I’d put against the game is there’s not really a steam community as of yet. This isn’t a massive mark against the game as it could grow with time and be something that gets larger. However, there’s a very distinct lack of presence from the development team in the Steam forums. That’s something I’d like to see change.\n\nOk, the premise of the game. I personally play a lot of League, but this game will appeal to you regardless of MOBA, although it’s very clearly marketed towards League players. You start as a casual player and seem to gain fans very quickly, while I accept this is intended, it does feel somewhat strange. Personal preference. Moving on. Minor add, lots of spelling mistakes, but it’s a foreign company, so I’d take that with a grain of salt.\n\nThe first bug I encountered, is the incredibly lackluster menu. The tablet system that explains parts of the game (does it?) and gives you random announcements seems like an ill thought of overlay that doesn’t add anything and instead clutters the screen (which you can still access the base menu while in).\n\nEventually, you’ll come to researching comfort picks. Which is nice. However, if you research the same champion again, instead of adding extra points into understanding an existing comfort pick, it simply creates another entry for the same champion. On top of that, not only does it create a fresh champion, it doesn’t have the same level of played experience. Which is supremely disappointing.\n\nAnother bug I’ve encountered is also to do with comfort picks. Once you pick your 6th champion as a comfort pick. Selecting them in any game since, will have you selecting your 5th comfort pick. To experiment, I selected a 7th comfort pick champ, and it still picked the 5th.\n\nThe options menu is completely barren, by which I mean it doesn’t exist. Want to mute your game? Sorry pal, not gonna happen. You have a very sub standard amount of options when you open the game (restricted to what resolution, whether it’s windowed or not, and what monitor it’s displayed on).\n\nAfter playing more and creating a random e-sports league you lose a lot of your individual identity. So I feel it should be clear whether you’re creating a team to be a part of, or creating a team to be the coach of.\n\nBasically, after playing the game, I don’t feel as if I have any agency, or any control over my pro gamer path. I’m just doing things, as I see them and if I have enough research then yep, I’m gonna do that. However, the effects of said research aren’t apparent beyond showing up in a profile and certainly aren’t explained through any tutorial.\n\nWhich leads me to the last thing. A tutorial… Where is it? This game expects you to understand what’s going on straight from the get go, and if you don’t…. Well it doesn’t actually matter because you’ll still get fans anyway. Any of the choices in game don’t seem to have ANY impact long term, where they really should.\n\nAs it stands right now, if what I’ve said interests you enough to support the dev team, please do so. If however, what I’ve said has made you consider where you spend your money, I think you are making a smart choice, and when the dev’s decide to make the game both A) true to the experience and B) work, then it will be a good game.","October 17, 2015","false","8.6"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","7","26","0","0"

And it's actually been around outside of Steam for a while.\n\nThe game feels incredibly unfinished, and is almost entirely random. Your choices and stats seem like they matter, but actually have very little impact. Career mode feels incredibly unfinished (I thought I was missing something, but turns out there's just no more of the game), and manager mode suffers from the same thing as the rest of the game, where your choices are ultimately inconsequential.","May 2","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
