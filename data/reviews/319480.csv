"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/319480/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\nIn a distant land not entirely unlike our own, an evil force grows powerful and restless (as evil forces are wont to do when they're out of Bagel Bites). Fortunately this distant land (we'll call it Cleveland) has a weary, two-weeks-from-retirement hero... just sort of hanging outside his home village in the woods – hunting I think, waiting for purpose to show up. And when purpose descends upon his village and sets it on fire he gets off his keister to save his son. Because he's no ordinary hero. He's Haggis.\n\nNo, seriously. That's his name.\n\nHaggis, the national dish of Scotland.\n\nWere Kimchi, Pierogi, and Couscous busy or something? God I hope Borscht is alright, we go way back.\n\nAll joking aside Odallus: The Dark Call (OH, Dallas!) is pretty darn fun. Empanada visits 8 stunning, lovingly crafted levels, cutting his way through your standard sword and sorcery baddies. As you progress you'll unlock new weapons and abilities to aid Gazpacho on his quest. Some of these weapons and abilities help you access previously inaccessible areas (torches to melt ice, spears to break hard-to-reach rocks, some kind of accessory to breathe underwater).\n\nAt the end of each level Sushi must face off with a boss; they're all great looking. There's a necromorph lookin' dude and a sand worm and Mother Brain and Skeletor – all primed and ready to challenge brave Kibbeh. And while they look really cool they're kind of push overs. I'm not really good at these kind of games, never have been. But I was able to brute force a lot of these guys and kill them on the first try – so don't expect some kind of white-knuckle challenge... health and weapons and checkpoints are plentiful.\n\nAnother minor quibble is the fact that, while I can replay a level, it doesn't appear I can fight the bosses again, which is lame. And sometimes the platforming is a little loose, a little floaty. You'll make jumps you shouldn't have and you'll fail jumps you should have made. I'm playing with a controller so it might be a bit tighter on old dependable.\n\nHOWEVER, this is good fun in that same way as seeing an old friend. Sure he's showing his age and he makes unintentional gross body noises... but it's nice to take a stroll down memory lane, bask in the nostalgia for a bit, forget your troubles and just be a kid again. Odallus looks gorgeous, painted all vibrant orange, red, blue and green; not monochromatic like a lot of these “retro” titles look. The synthesized soundtrack is great, the monster sounds are great, and the goofy little cutscenes are great. If you can get past a mostly forgettable story, easy gameplay and some occasionally wonky platforming – AND you're in the market for an homage to classic Metroidvania/Ghosts 'n Goblins fun, you could do a hell of a lot worse.\n\nNow rise, brave, uh, Ceviche, and cleanse this land of evil once more.","July 15, 2015","true","13.1"," 77 of 112 people (69%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","69","77","112","43","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/319480/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","When I think of games like Ninja Gaiden, Shinobi, Castlevania, and Ghouls 'N Ghost, my childhood comes back to me and the countless hours I spent playing these games and occasionally raging. The stories were told through minimal pixel art and music was chip tune heaven. These games hold a special place in my heart not only because they were amazing to play as a kid, but because they used what they had for the time giving story, music, tone, and narrative through very little means. These games are accomplishments in game design as much as they are fun to play.\n\nOdallus seeks to capture the magic of games of yesteryear and bring some classic gaming nostalgia along with it. I am happy to say it does this in oodles and with it's own unique style. Odallus like the aforementioned titles is a side scrolling action/platformer, paying homage to each title in its own unique way. The story of the game is about a great warrior in a dark time, the gods have turned their back on all humanity and demons and monsters begin to reap souls to their delight. The warrior (you) must fight the onslaught of an army of darkness in search of his son. This immediately sets the tone to one of dark, gothic, horror, and this is captured perfectly. The monsters are grotesque, the architecture is strange, even the save point is a giant skeleton!\n\nOne thing that immediately caught my eye was the amazing pixel artwork in the game. Yes, the monsters are hideous and ugly but damn they look good. Cut scenes are reminiscent of Ninja Gaiden(NES) where they are told in clips and scenes that reveal more of the story of Odallus. The main game itself is simple and retro in style. Each area has a color palette and tone to it. This doesn't mean that Odallus is boring to look at, but in fact makes each area feel unique and distinct from the last you were in.\n\nThe gameplay is also rather deceptively simple, there is only about 8 buttons for you to manage, that's including the start button. You have an attack, movement and special. There are items that you can also pick up in the game like axes and torches that you throw at the enemy. Things do get a bit more complicated in the late game but I will just cover the basic experience from go. One thing Odallus excels is fantastic level design. The levels are not necessarily straight forward to the boss, rinse and repeat. Matter of fact there are plenty of paths and secrets to discover, even in the first level. This is what takes the simplistic gameplay and makes it unique and challenging. You could just rush to the boss and clear the level but if you take time to explore, gather power ups, heart pieces and other upgrades, these make future battles much easier. Power ups can be found Shovel Knight style, littered about the game, perhaps behind a hidden wall or requiring another power.\n\nSpeaking of the battles, Odallus just like games of yesterday, is damn hard! Your character isn't exactly the most agile fighter in the world. Enemies are just as dangerous as the boss, are numerous and respawn very quickly. You constantly must be on your toes or take needless damage. There are things in the level to counter act this, from shops to chests containing standard hunks of meat. There are times that I did rage quite a bit, as Odallus can sometimes have difficulty spikes. Bosses are standard as well, having patterns that once mastered become second nature. I shouldn't forget to mention the map system that let's you choose where to explore. Making returning to earlier levels easy and downright required.\n\nAll this is backed up by many modern touches and features. Rebindable keys, controller support, TV mode, and leaderboards. The UI sits on the sides of the screen displaying all important information and upgrades. This is one area that I would've loved a bit of an option on to turn on/off depending on when I needed it. This is a minor complaint and hardly an issue. The only other area that I had an issue was the start up menu. While it was easy to use, on my screen it was super tiny. Sometimes I had to squint to see what I was looking at.\n\nOther areas of the game are also given the classic retro touch, such as the sound track and sound effects. Chiptunes are plentiful having the same gothic tone. This gives the game a definite Ghoul 'N Ghost vibe and every level was like a flash back to a much simpler time. Matter of fact that's how you could just sum up Odallus. It's a flashback to a much simpler time but does things right when it comes to modern features. Things like voice-acting aren't present because that would throw off the tone of the game.\n\nThe replay and game length are solely dependent on the player's drive to find all the hidden secrets in the game. This does require retreading the same areas sometimes, so that can be seen as repetitive, but most of the time it would involve an area you haven't been through. The game can probably take anywhere from 5-7 hours depending on your skill level.\n\nI think anyone who loves retro style games will love everything Odallus has to offer. With Shovel Knight giving a resurgence to these style of games. It really deserves your attention if you are looking for something similar. While the game isn't super innovative, it masters the features that we have all come to love and expect from these types of games. From classic power ups, chiptunes, and great pixel art, Odallus brings back the old school flair with style.","August 23, 2015","true","1.6"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","3"

I myself died plently of times to the zone bosses but kept on fighting until I won. This is one of the elements that Odallus: The Dark Call shines in. The game forces you to learn the bosses attack patterns and not just spam the attack key and expect to win. I enjoy this feature because there are to many games that make boss fights easy and bland. Plus there is no better feeling then finally killing the boss that was preventing you from progressing. Ahh it feels like im playing Castlevania on the NES as a kid again.

Let me start by saying that I have been looking forward to this game since its announcement.  That being said, the game did not disappoint me.\n\nSo what is good about the game?  It is a solid retro game.  In the full time that I played the game for my twitch stream, I did not find any real incidents where I was left scratching my head over bizzare hit boxes, goofy control issues and generally annoying bugs that crop up from rushed development.  This game is rock solid, plays well, and is pretty fair in terms of its difficulty curve.\n\nIt is very metroidvania lite, but that isn't nessesarily a bad thing.  The collectible items are evenly spaced throughout the game, so you are never left wondering when the next pickup will be.  It is also very refreshing to see that every single stage in the game (barring the first one) impliments uses for all of the ability powerups you collect in your journey.  This is not a game that gives you a powerup, and then only has you use it once to pass an obstical.  The ability uses make sense, and can be fun to work with when needed.\n\nThe controls are solid, it was entirely my controller that had me throwing sub weapons by accident (rolling D-pads are terrible), I tested the issue out on a keyboard and never had a similar problem.  The level designs are fun and engaging, and never really overstay their welcome.  Revisiting a stage will typically involve powerups that you had collected later in the game, thus movement that was bothersome before, becomes much easier, getting you to those target areas you may have missed before quicker.  The game is pieced together perfectly.\n\nThere are small puzzle solving sections in the game, lever puzzles and such, and while I was worried at first about them breaking the flow of the game, they ended up not being that much of an issue to solve.  Demon's Crest, Ghost and Goblins, and Castlevania; the games that the game takes inspiration from, are done justice as far as I am concerned.  Scattered through out the game are various tributes and nods to each of the games, without breaking immersion to the world and game setting.\n\nThe pixel art is gorgeous, the game runs like smooth butter, and the sound effects are not ear sores to listen to as you play.  All and all, as stated above, the game is a very solid package of fun, and a brilliant retro classic style game.\n\nBut its not without its flaws, and those flaws are namely small issues that will not directly impact the gameplay at all.\n\nFirst off, the game is advertised as being 4+ hours long.  My very first playthrough, I managed to not only collect 100% of the items, and clocked in at 2:57:38.  I did not speed my way through the game, I legitimately took my time to explore the game.  I enjoyed my time, but I would say that this game is more close to a comfortable 3 hour playtime.  There is no newgame+ bonuses that I am currently aware of.  Once finished, the only thing left to do is start fresh a new game.  Is three hours a bad thing?  Not for me it isn't, but I would be foolish to not assume that an advertised 4+ hour game time, being marketed at a 15 dollar price tag (at the time of this review), is pretty excessive.\n\nGiven the gametime as a whole, I would honestly recommend this game for 10 dollars not 15.  This is unfortunate, because there are so many games out there for 15 dollars that will give you more game time and value for your money.  Unless you are like me, who plans on engaging in some speedrunning to try and see if I can best my previos times, there is really only one playthrough.  Regardless if that short playthrough is fun or not, the price point is a factor in recommendations, and it may drive away some customers who would otherwise look this way.\n\nThe other issue I had was a general lack of story telling.  The game sets itself up with a pretty epic story line, but the only real spaces where that storyline is engaged are involving the begining of the game, two bosses in the game, and the end of the game.  There is really no basis for WHY your character is going out of his way to explore and collect relics and artifacts for the cause, outside of "game reasons".  A great opportunity to tell a story would have invovled collecting the individual "shards" after each boss.  Each stage boss could further the plot and add more impact to the big climax and twist of an ending.  The story unfortunately, is kinda lost in its presentation, which leaves the game standing on its only real strength which is that the gameplay is just simple and great fun.\n\nThe final issue is the difficulty.  The game is really easy.  I was never really presented with much of a threat through the entire game.  Adding difficulty options to the game may help this (and I am not saying to damage sponge the enemies to artificially inflate the difficulty).  As it stands, there are extrememly generous save points, and remarkably generous amounts of sub weapons and health power ups.  It makes the game simple and enjoyable, but sacrifices the ball busting difficulty of the titles it was inspired by.\n\nThese flaws are not game breaking problems in their own rights.  They are just observations that I had through my full playthrough of the game.  I beat it in one sitting, my audience enjoyed the show, and I will probably keep playing this title even more as I attempt to beat it in faster and faster times.  The price is a pretty heavy sale though.  I do recommend the game, but I would suggest waiting for sales to arrive unless the Developers do deside to drop the price.  10 bucks for what you get seems fair to me.  15, is a little steep.\n\nTerrific game though.  Thank you very much Joymasher.","July 15, 2015","true","40.3"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","9"

Odallus is great, but it's not for everyone. In fact, while I wholeheartedly recommend it to fans of Castlevania and other games of that ilk (and difficulty), it's not without its flaws and quirks. If you can look past a handful of non-gamebreaking (though maybe you'll need to repeat a level once or twice) bugs, some questionable gameplay decisions, and a script that's as filled with errors as the average NES port, jump on in (albeit perhaps on sale; I 100% the game in less than six hours. While I prefer my games on the short side, and think $15 is a fine price point for a game of this quality, some may feel that's too high a dollar to hour ratio).\n\nSome things I liked:\nThe actual core gameplay is fantastic. Taking its cues solidly from Castlevania, but updated to be more user-friendly, combat is all about balancing offense and defense. Normal enemies are mostly easy fodder, but the boss fights range from mildly tough to rage-inducing (especially if you don't know where to hit, as sometimes it's not quite obvious [I'm looking at you final boss final form]). A handful of subweapons have varying usefulness, and you can eventually get sword upgrades that attack faster and deal more damage.\nThe platforming is pretty great too, and unlike Castlevania, you can alter your jump after you've leaped - no more sailing into the abyss. Well, you'll still sail into the abyss, but you have slightly more control over your fate.\n\nExcept for the minecart level. That's just death over and over.\n\nThe levels are all unique and all very cool. A town being razed. An icy mountain. A forest. A watery temple. Each with their own enemies, boss fights, and items and gadgets to find.  Like a Metroid-style Castlevania game, you use these items to backtrack to different locations for different upgrades and equipment, and fortunately the game is incredibly backtrack friendly. In each, there are doors to open, floors to break, and bosses to fight. But once opened, broken, and slain, they remain that way; backtracking through levels becomes fun to find the last secrets, instead of a frustrating grind through a place you already mastered. It's a great way of balancing difficulty, and makes the last level very hard, but not overly infuriating, as parts of it stay beaten even after you fail.\n\nThe soundtrack. Damn, the soundtrack is fantastic. Crunchy retro tunes really set the mood, and help you feel exactly like a barbarian trying to avenge his ruined town and dead son. Or something like that, I can't really relate. Put that on the box, not a relatable main character.\n\nSome things I thought weren't quite perfect:\nI got stuck on the minecart level a few times because if you die above ground, sometimes you get stuck and have to exit to the main menu and start that level fresh.\nSome boss hitboxes aren't well-defined.\nUpgrades aren't just a happy bonus, but damn near essential for beating the game proper. Doing it without is possible, and there are achievements for it, but I'm a casual baby and could barely beat it with all the upgrades.\n\n\nOverall, it's an excellent game, and as a big fan of Oniken (who couldn't beat it :() I'm pretty much down for whatever Joymasher does next. They truly nail the area between retro fanservice and modern quality-of-life improvements.\n\n★★★★☆","January 7","true","13.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","14","16","3","0"

Developer Joymasher has constructed a much more solid effort in the form of Odallus: The Dark Call, a more exploration focused affair set against a swords and Satanism backdrop. Though the term "Metroidvania" is being thrown around with this one, Odallus actually has more in common with the NES Strider game than with pre-SotN Castlevanias. In short, it's what I had hoped Rondo of Blood would be before I learned that Rondo of Blood isn't actually that good.\n\nThe thing that makes this game click for me is, while the stages are laid in the framework of "go from point A to point B and fight a boss," the areas themselves are actually quite massive and reward a bit of poking around. It follows the motif of being locked off from a certain area before collecting THE THING that opens that area up, but discovering the alternate exits in the stages that lead to their sublevels or just seeing the way the routes loop back on each other is a reward in its own right for exploration nerds. It can get a bit overwhelming at times, the game has no automap and unless you're taking diligent notes, you're going to have a bit of a time remembering where you have and haven't poked around in your search for that last secret in a given stage. However, this approach is a bit more organic and fulfilling than "color in spots on a map" and helps extend a rather brief game in a manner that doesn't feel tacked on. I'm not sure exactly how much is required to uncover before you're allowed to make it to the final stage, but we'll probably get a good idea with future speedruns or Games Done Quick events.\n\nThe game does have some rough edges. While controlling Haggis is responsive enough for the most part, combat can be frustrating given the short reach of your sword and the sometimes dubious hitboxes. If your experience is anything like mine, you're going to end up cheesing the hell out of a boss or two just to keep the game moving. Jumping while attacking is especially wonky, since this is one of those games where jump height is controlled by the duration of the button press. There's sometimes some weird stuff going on with the scrolling, each stage will have arbitrary spots where the screen has to quickly scroll vertically to reveal some area that's off the beaten path. The effect can be disorienting and at times even causes Haggis to jerk around like a catfish on deck. I'm also not sure if some of the grammatical errors in the admittedly over-dramatized dialog are an intentional tribute to the rushed localizations of the 8-bit era, or just natural goofs. They don't show up quite frequently enough to suggest that they are intentional, but they're about the only comic relief in a story that plays it 100% straight.\n\nIf you prefer your sprites and your gameplay decidedly on the 8-bit portion of the spectrum, definitely give Odallus a shot. Visually, it's a gorgeous game, even at its most grotesque, and it will probably hit the same kinds of buttons that Shovel Knight did for players who grew up in the pre-polygon era. With just a little more polish it could have been a perfect 10, but it's still worth the price of admission.","July 26, 2015","true","7.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/recommended/319480/","PURESEXCELLENCY","Squire Grooktook","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PURESEXCELLENCY/","360 products in account","Odallus is  a dark fantasy action/exploration game.The progression in Odallus is reminiscient of many Metroidvania's, in which players explore, fight monsters, and acquire new powers as they travel, which are often used to revisit and uncover new areas and secrets in previously explored areas. However, the execution is much closer to the cult classic Super Nes title, Demon's Crest.\n\nRather then taking place in one gigantic and interconnected world (ala Metroid and later Castlevania games), Odallus divides its world into a set of areas and locations, accessed one by one through exploring prior areas, like Demon's Crest. This allows the game to focus a bit more on action, crafting stages that offer multiple paths and secrets to find, but with a tighter, faster pace.\n\nThe design of these stages is very solid. None of them overstay their welcome, and usually end at just the right time. Alternate paths tend to flow into one another, so stages offer a bit of freedom of progression without the hassle of backtracking. Secrets are hidden and require some hunting, but aren't so out of the way that they take you out of the action.\n\nThe exploration is well executed, but the actual moment to moment combat and action falls into the "good, but not great" camp. The protaganist, Haggis, controls well enough, but he's not particularly interesting to play as either. He doesn't have any unique gimmicks to set him apart from other protaganists. He's neither very fast nor very slow, and his primary attack feels oddly laggy despite being easily cancellable. Likewise, many of the enemies and bosses Haggis faces don't require a great deal of tactics or reflexes. Basic pattern recognition will easily dispatch even the strongest foes. The battles in Odallus are enjoyable enough, but they aren't as unique or inspired as the action game titans of yore.\n\nOne place Odallus triumphs though is in its art direction. Backgrounds and monsters are rife with detail despite the simple 8-bit approach, and the whole adventure exudes a lovely dark fantasy atmosphere that's strengthened by some great boss quotes and snippets of lore scattered about. The story is also a bit more intriguing then I expected, even if it's not quite as developed as it could have been.\n\nOverall, Odallus is as engrossing a Metroidvania as any. It's a well crafted game that had me eager to explore every new area. It's not a game I'd play and replay for the action, but I found it engaging the whole way through.","July 19, 2015","true","5.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Odallus changes the formula a bit from a straight-forward action-platformer by opening up the world so that previous stages can be re-visited and searched for secrets, something the player should definitely do once they acquire a new ability.\n\nThe story has a dark vibe to it, something akin to Berserk, but many things do go unexplained, especially at the end. But the story is not the main reason one plays these games; no, it's for the tight action. And in that, Odallus mostly delivers. There are a couple of bosses that can be simply brute-forced, but mostly you do need to learn their patterns and timing, which is good. The stages are large-ish and hold many secrets and small puzzle sections, but nothing that will kill the pacing completely.\n\nIt took me under five hours to 100% the game, but I consider it time well spent.

Can't exactly trust your memories from a normal to a veteran playthrough(Alucard reference from SOTN maybe?).\n- Some references to other games/ media.\n\nCons:\n- Some bugs here and there, not gamebreaking at all, just annoying sometimes, like with the  minecart parts that sometimes you fall on land but can't move and this forces you to quit and re-start the whole level(might get a fix in the future, idk).\n- Short, only 9 stages, although this fits the Castlevania style. It's important to note that there's quite the number of places to explore if you aim for a 100% run, and doing achievements further increases the play time. I've finished it all in 23 hours, but I'm not exactly fast.\n\nTo me it was a well worth game, the pros far exceed the cons, really fun gameplay, totally recommended to the fans of Castlevania/ Metroidvania, oldschool games and medieval fantasy like Berserk.","February 19","true","22.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

So I wouldn't exactly blame anyone for reading Odallus' store description and giving it a pass - but if they did, they'd be missing out on a modern classic. Odallus definitely lives up to all three of those series, and is proof you can still make games like them.\n\nJoyMasher's last game, Oniken (which I would also gladly recommend), was inspired in large part by Fist of the North Star, and Odallus has its own 80s manga inspiration in Berserk, which you can see in a lot of the enemy designs and some story ideas. You play as Haggis, a soldier-turned-hunter who returns to his village one night to find it ablaze, as a local lord has invaded, killed almost everyone, and kidnapped his son. What's worse, people are transforming into demons. It's definitely dark fantasy, which gives it a unique flair compared to Castlevania and Ghouls and Ghost (though not quite Demon's Crest).\n\nGameplay-wise, Haggis has his sword, which has a decent amount of range, as well as three sub-weapons: an axe that goes straight, a torch that goes downward and causes a fire for sustained damage, and a spear that flies up in an arc. They're all useful in their own right and can help you out a lot against certain enemies. Haggis also feels very tight to control, and while there are some tricky jumps it never felt like the game was unreasonable at all. The game's bosses also all pose a threat, but are fair about it.\n\nOdallus also has some Metroidvania elements to it, as the game's Ghouls and Ghosts map contains several bonus levels you won't be able to access immediately, and every level has things you'll need the ability to push big blocks or glide to get to. It also lets you save and head back to the map whenever you want, meaning you don't need to go through the whole level again just to find whatever you're looking for. I beat the game in about five hours, but there is an extra difficulty mode that I hear changes things up a lot. All in all, if you're jonesing for some new Castlevania stuff, Odallus could tide you over quite nicely before Bloodstained is finished.","May 2","true","5.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I've probably never done this before.\ntl;dr:\nThe game is cool and it does feel like an oldskul title.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe graphics are sometimes obviously much better (as they benefit hardware wise), using capabilities that were not available back in the day.\nTheir blend of pixel-art-style is unique and somewhat strange as they intentionally used very few colors for every character and creature in the game (less than you normally would expect from an actual 8-bit title). Unlike an actual 8-bit title, the sprites don't share colors often. Each sprite has it's own set of colors and each color-set is somewhat distinct and specific to a single sprite. This makes for a very crisp and clear display that also stirs some strange emotions at times. There was something very alien at times about the graphical choices in old games and I think this bizarre use of (very few) colors captures that very well and even builds up on this making for a very unique vibe that somehow melds in my mind with 80's and early 90's Heavy Metal albums.\nThe intro animation is pretty fantastic.\n\nGameplay:\nThe gameplay is rather good. It is very enjoyable with a joypad. I'd imagine that without one (using the keyboard), it would not be so much fun probably. You constantly feel like you are freshening up on your action platformer skills. You will improve if you play carefully and pay attention to patterns, doing what you can to learn from your mistakes.\nExploring the game is fun and it is vast so there is plenty to explore for a few hours.\nThe weapon and armor upgrades feel right and the secrets are fun and rewarding to look for.\n\nChallenge:\nThe difficulty in this game could be vastly mitigated by the weapons, armor and hearts you find along the way, as well as the shops that are simply a play to grab additional health and ammo.\nSome enemies are harder to figure out than others. Some enemies are fairly easy once you understand their patterns.\nThe game isn't hard but it's also rarely too easy (although that does happen). This is subjective. Some people find it too hard and I feel there are areas in the game that are more challenging than others. Overall there are no annoying spikes.\n\nStory:\nThe story is a pretty simple plot about Dark Gods, evil demons and a lone superiorly skilled soldier made demon hunter going around, searching and slaying more and more evil creatures that happen upon his path. The texts are pretty good and fit with the atmosphere of the game.\n\nSound:\nThe sound effects and the music are good, I've never felt the urge to listen to music in the BG when I'm playing this game even though I imagine that Heavy Metal would suit this wonderfully.\n\nOverall:\n* Do you like Metroidvania games?\n* Do you prefer a gritty dark atmosphere in games?\n* Do you like the aesthetics of old games like Golden Axe and Rastan?\n\nIf you answered yes, there's a good chance you"ll love (or like) this game.\nIt is pretty good. Don't think there is any other game on Steam that really scratches that itch. Well actually there is! Axiom Verge I believe but the two games are very different. If you are into this sort of thing you"ll probably end up playing both of them if that's within your time constraints.","November 1, 2015","true","19.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

If you like Castlevania, you should pick it up, and I say that as someone who did not enjoy Joymasher's last game, Oniken.\n\nIt is challenging, but not as difficult as the original Castlevania games. This is mainly due to save points and the game saving your progress in a level even if you have to continue. You'll never have to re do a boss or find an item twice, though you may have to do some platforming or autoscroll sections a lot. These are typically a lot of fun though.\n\nThe story is pretty fun, though I don't understand why a guy who is singularly focused on getting his kid back from Lovecraftian blood gods would keep backtracking to find larger bags to carry his weapons and new jewelry.\n\nThe only real complaints that I have are with the bosses and the graphics. The bosses are really cool and impressive, but they aren't especially hard. The only boss that had me wanting to toss my controller was the final boss, and he's a pretty big jump in difficulty from the rest of the game.\n\nThe graphics are obviously supposed to look like they are from an 8 bit system. It's a stylistic choice, but with gorgeous games like Shovel Knight around, it seems silly for the developers to limit themselves, especially when I can tell that a lot of creativity went in to making the bosses look gruesome.

This one is a superb mix of Castlevania, Metroid, and Astyanax.  It's got a dark story about gods abandoning the world and one man's quest to find his son and reclaim what little joy there is to be had in his life.  The sprites look great and the design work for the bosses is inspired with some horrific, sometimes even Lovecraftian nightmares staring you down.  Controls are tight and superb and the game has a plethora of secrets to find, with control schemes for classic NES controller, keyboard, or modern 360 controller.

Combat is precise and rewards thoughtful play. Areas are well designed. Backtracking is well designed such that you always get rewarded for your trouble. Difficulty increases steadily throughout the game. Platforming is not cheap and punishing, but is instead a lot of fun. The setting and plot of the game is reminiscent of Berserk. If you like Symphony of the Night or Mega Man X you will be right at home here.\n\nIn-depth review:\n\nThe thing that really struck me about this game is that it is one of the fairest games I've ever played. Most other "retro" games nowadays bombard you with cheap deaths and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies, but not this game. Every enemy and obstacle in the game can be overcome with precise timing, tactics, and spacing. Every enemy has an attack pattern that it will follow, which is what you as the player need to analyze and overcome. One or two ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tty enemies aside, everything in this game fits that mold. Platforming sections are much of the same. Once you figure out what sequence of button presses you need, you can do it perfectly every time. If you can't figure out how to do it with just your sword, there are 3 sub-weapons available to help you. These sub-weapons are ranged attacks with different trajectories, similar to the knife, axe, and holy water in Castlevania.\n\nThe other thing that really delighted me was the strict adherence to the action part of the action platformer genre. The difference between an action platformer and a regular platformer is the focus on combat. No instant death pits, no knockback when you get hit, no pixel perfect jumps, etc. Though the game has a lot of platforming sections, most of them are pretty easy and straightforward. It is the combat with enemies that will wear you down. A really cool feature of this game is the ability to parry enemy projectiles by hitting them with your sword. This allows you to stay on the offensive much more than you normally would be able to because now instead of jumping all around to dodge stuff, you can stay right up in your enemies face and block all his stuff while hitting him at the same time. This adds another layer of skill to the game, as well as forcing the player to think about the risk/reward of blocking projectiles. As I mentioned above though, enemies obey strict timings in their attacks, which you can master. In the end you feel like a badass while also feeling challenged.\n\nThe last part of the game I want to talk about is the exploration and the secrets. It's really good. The game has a very open and vertical layout, more similar to Wizards and Warriors than to any Castlevania game. The game follows the same general formula as every metroidvania games. You will see a part of a level that is unreachable to you, making you say to yourself "oh, there must be an item that lets me get that". However, the item progression is very much non-linear in the sense that you will not get the double jump item right after you encounter you first jump that requires it. Most items like that are buried deep at the end of a labyrinth, usually requiring you to traverse a large area while hitting a bunch of switches that will lower a gate with an item behind it. The first time this happened I had no idea what to expect, each time you get an item (save for one instance) it is a complete surprise. This is a nice break from the scenario I described above where you can pretty much perfectly predict when you will get a certain item.\n\nThe reason the exploration aspect of the game is so good is becaue of the level design and layout. The level progression is basically taken straight from Castlevania 3. Every level has two exits, one that will take you to the next main level, and one "secret" exit that will take you to a different level. The levels aren't really secret as they are required to finish the game, but I'm going to call them by that name. I noticed that the secret levels have a higher difficulty level than the main ones, which is a nice touch because the game is designed such that you access those levels later in the game. What basically ends up happening is that you find an item in a main level, then go back through every previous level and secret level until you find a spot where you can get somewhere you couldn't before. This will often lead to another new item that will let you reach other new areas in other levels. This cycle continues until you have every item, but also gets more difficult as the later secret levels are quite a bit more difficult than the main levels. The game also tells you how many items there are to collect in each level so you don't to crazy trying to keep track, a much appreciated touch.\n\nOf couse the game is not perfect so here I will talk about the stuff that I didn't like or stuff that could be improved on. The shops in the game suffer from severe Skyrim syndrome. What I mean is that they are nice to have in the beginning of the game and can be quite useful, but by the end you will be skipping every one becuase you never have the need to buy anything. In addition to this, your gold total is ever increasing with nothing to spend it on. This isn't really a problem as much as a nitpick, but I went in expecting at least something important to be available in the shop, but the only things to buy a healing items, sub-weapon ammo, and extra lives. Nothing new is ever added.\n\nThe other thing I don't think is quite perfect is the bosses. The games combat is set up in such a way that once you figure out the bosses pattern, it becomes trivial to defeat. This is fine for regular enemies, but I would have liked to see some of the bosses with a rage mode that changed up attack timings and added new attacks. I also think some of the bosses could have done with some more health, I was able to kill some of them after just a few attacks. On the flip side though, this game has some incredibly creative and original bosses, which I love to see. At the end of the day though, defeating the bosses didn't really fill me with satisfaction as much as it filled me with the feeling that I had just completed a chore.\n\nOverall the game is fantastic and is the best retro style game I've played since they became a thing, even beating out Shovel Knight and Axiom Verge. I got it on sale but it's absolutely worth the full price.","April 8","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Odallus transcends that "me too" faux pixel trend while drowning out the obnoxious & busy chiptunes. Though it wears few colors and sings in lean low-bit tones, it avoids shamelessly aping the old styles simply for the sake of it. Odallus is an authentic, brilliant relic paradoxically born a quarter century late. Its exploration, platforming, and storytelling are not threads in the visage of tribute nor the trappings of some homage; they are the steps of an evolution now long succeeded.","August 21, 2015","true","6.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

I didn't want it: I NEEDED it.\n\nAnd boy, was I not let down.\n\nOdallus is a fantastic homage to the great action adventure games of yesteryear, combining elements from Castlevania, Gargoyle's Quest, Astynax, and Metroid. It blends sword-swinging action with careful platforming exploration, all within a darkly grim fantasy world.\n\nThe graphics are gorgeous, the music (while subdued) fits the atmosphere perfectly, and the story is engaging enough to want to see to the end. And the gameplay, of course, provides more than enough challenge for those new to the genre and even for those who grew up with it (like myself.) It was just easy enough that I was able to progress at a moderate pace, but just difficult enough that I felt I got my money's worth.\n\nIf I have a gripe about the game, it's the dialogue: whether intentional or not, the erratic Engrish took me out of the experience at times. I hope it's something they fix in the future.\n\nBut if a few grammatical mistakes are the only complaints I have with the game, that's quite alright by me. I cannot stress enough how amazing this game is. Buy it.","September 24, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Like Joymasher's first commercial game, Oniken, this is a true love letter to old action platformers, made with careful execution. A homage to the games like NES/SNES Castlevanias and even Faxanadu and similar ones.\n\nOdallus is an action platformer, that features quite a lot of explorable stuff, secrets, stuff to find, bosses even some puzzles. I personally wouldn't quite put this game under the label "metroidvania", as this is something that could've happened before Symphony of the Night came out and that label was born. I'd go as far as saying, that this is what Castlevania could've been, if it would've got another sequel for the NES after Super Castlevania IV and before the SotN. Odallus has a nice mash-up of separate levels, that aren't linear - the world is not really connected and thus the backtracking isn't as heavy. This also has in my opinion allowed the developers to do a way better level design, as the player isn't having an option to always come back the very same route. And yeah, the level design is good indeed - I never felt, that I got killed or took damage unfairly, eventhough some sections require you to be really alert. I also love the way you have to progress in this game: first you beat some worlds and later you have to FIND routes to the next ones.\n\nThere are a lot of enemy variety, and I feel, that all of them have their purpose, especially as the level design complements the enemies and their placement always. Bosses are also well executed, having a lot of variety, that forces the player to use proper tactics. Some might feel, that the bosses are a bit pattern heavy though (not me, but some might :)).\n\nLike Metroid, this game don't have leveling up. Every upgrade (weapon, armor, health, ability) you have to find. With money you can only buy secondary weapons, food and lives. Like I said earlier, this game has quite a lot of secrets, and so on, to find out.\n\nGraphics are a top notch stuff, emulating the 8-bit aesthetics pretty truthfully, especially with the TV-filter on. Soundtrack is also amazing.\n\nOdallus isn't the easiest game, but it is fair and thus really satisfying. I personally feel, that it has just the right amount of challenge, but if you're not experienced with games like these, prepare to die a lot. :)\n\nHUGE recommendation. One of the best throwback games available, something that every retro-fan, and other action platformer fans should own.

The art, the sound effects, the level design and variety of gameplay are all top-notch. Having a BLAST so far. The only thing I don't like so far is the design decision to *sometimes* go through a short obstacle course of sorts before fighting the boss again (in the event that you didn't defeat it the first time). A save point right before the boss would have been preferred. Most bosses have a checkpoint right before them, though - so this isn't too much of a big deal. :)\n\nJust wanted to say that I'm having a great time and THANK YOU for making games like this.

Up+Attack performs sub-item attack.\n\n-Combat is simple. Beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of stuff with your sword and sub-items until it dies. Enemies have patterns for movement and attacks with some randomization between them.\n\n-The upgrade system is direct and linear. Hold more sub-items, get stronger armor, stronger sword, more life.\n\n-There is a world map for selecting what stage you want to do. Stages are somewhat open with multiple paths to the stage boss as well as multiple exits which open different stages for you to select on the world map. You can revisit stages as often as you like and the world map gives you information about the stages regarding secrets found and whether you've killed the stage boss.\n\n-You have limited lives once you've started a stage but losing all your lives only kicks you back to the world map. You keep any upgrades you find along the way. You can also find merchants within the stages that will sell you food to restore life, more sub-item ammo and even extra lives.\n\n*Review posted with a little over an hour played and 4 stages completed.","July 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

It breaks this annoying trend with indie games where it's an excuse to have bad and lazy graphics and gameplay and just call them "retro style". Shovel Knight and Odallus are two of the only game's I've seen actually come close to replicating an old school 8-bit platformer both visually and mechanically. However since it mechanically plays like an 8-bit game, there are finicky 8-bit problems, like the "sticky" platforming for example. Odallus also takes back to days where things were so cryptically annoying sometimes it made you shut off the game until a buddy told you what to do. Some gameplay design also feels intentionally dated for no reason other than to replicate the feel of an NES game, like respawning enemies and bad pop in. These were issues with games that were either unintentional bugs or hardware limitations, neither which can be an excuse for modern PC gaming. However just as easily you can pick apart Odallus and find it's flaws, it's just as easy to fall in love with the charm of the game. The artstyle is fantastic, the gameplay is as good as it can get for it's goal of replicating an NES game, and the soundtrack is catchy and energetic. Honestly, I'm surprised Odallus launched under the radar because it is a very fun and interesting expirience that would remind many of Castlevania or Ghosts 'n' Goblins/Super Ghouls 'n' Ghosts with it's punishing (and sometimes straight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) gameplay. Overall, a pretty good game, maybe not for it's price though.","December 27, 2015","true","9.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Most people will bring up Castlevania for comparison (or closer to us, Shovel Knight), but the dark story, the melancholic atmosphere and the trackback needed to find powerups and secrets really remind more of Gargoyle's Quest or Demon's Crest.\nMinor complaints would be its short length, peaks in difficulty at the beginning and at the very end, a few small bugs and a price tag a little to high for what it offers.

The first thing you'll notice is that the game is very beautiful; the dreamy pastel pixels that comprise the game world would be right at home in an experimental late NES game, and the developers have even gone to the trouble of restricting colors used per sprite in order to give the assets a more authentic vibe!  It's some of the finest pixel art you'll ever see in a game!  (The music is good too, but it is not nearly as notable as the artwork.)\n\nThere is no lag or floatiness in the controls; you are solely responsible for your mistakes here, which is okay because the game isn't terribly difficult.  The last boss poses a suitably epic challenge, though, and the rest of the game is a great deal of fun even if it doesn't induce you to curse your own birth.  Odallus is a bit like Rondo of Blood in that it features gigantic, sprawling levels that remain discrete -- it never takes that final turn into the labyrinthine world of the metroidvania.  Consequently, you won't be lost if you take a lot of time between play sessions.\n\nI have but one complaint:  some of the English is pretty bad.  With everything else Odallus has going for it, I don't suppose that's much of a big deal, but I found it pretty jarring (most of the runic story slabs border on incomprehensible).  I really wanted to feel Haggis' quest, you know?","August 22, 2015","true","9.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its a fine game.\n\nWhat is strange about this game is that it doenst let you discover things yourself like the older games did. Everything is explained, from the rock that is too heavy to how to escape the first boss net. It lost the sense of wonder a little bit, the things are connected to you already. It could be just the rock there. That is it. You try to push and cant. Try another way.\n\nThe first boss for example, after killing him that I realized there were two blocks on the upper part to avoid him. But I just axed him to death.. because it was a better solution. Like Castlevania 4 where using the whip alone is a better solution. (see sequelitis video to know what Im saying)\n\nLove the first bag: "Your was increased by 5". MY... WHAT? oh the tension!\n\nNice graphics, I also like the movement and scale of things very much. Easy to learn. About the story, I dont really care. Fire everywhere, jumping fire, firing burning in pits with no combustible whatsoever eternally. Love thi stuff.

It draws inspiration from many games during the NES era, while integrating some modern mechanics to keep things interesting.  Initially the homage to the first three Castlevanias is very apparent, the graphics, level select and movement all bring back a familiarity that even later Castlevania's have trouble envoking. The level design and game mechanics also pay homage to many other franchises from that era as well.\nProgressing through the levels I found areas that reminded me of jumping through the tree tops in Wizards and Warriors, a mythology and backdrop as rich as The Battle of Olympus and plenty of secret areas initially unaccessable which would require me to return with specific relics that allow me to perform great feats much like a Zelda game.\nThen there are the bosses fights.  These delightful bouts with demon knights and giant monsters will seem familar to anyone who has played Castlevania or Metroid but the boss fights also draw influence from modern games such as Dark Souls.  The patterns for some of the bosses are incredibly complex, drawing the perfect amount of anxiety between each move. I'd fumble and die many times before learning their entire cycle.  By the end I'm ducking and hanging off of edges, jumping and cleaving all in perfect sync creating some of the most fluid and dance like boss battles I've witnessed in a game.\n\nThis game has a lot of depth to it, and despite borrowing heavily from so many classic games, once the rose coloured glasses associated with the nostaligia it invoked wore off it is a well polished and interesting game that holds it's own weight.  The player has lots of control over the character, you can climb ledges and move blocks, trade with merchants, or find relics to add some extra abilities.  Each level drawing from a different inspiration presents a smörgåsbord of playgrounds to explore each one unique in its play style while all keeping the same familar control.","April 23","true","14.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have to collect armor/sword upgrades by aquiring relics that allow you to go back to previous levels and access areas you previously could not get too.

It takes the most acclaimed elements in these franchises and throws in a couple of extra qualities, most notably unlinear/exploration-based gameplay. In that sense, it actually feels like a fresh game on its own right rather than a mere clone of the gothic 8-bit games it drawns inspiration from.\n\nIt really is a game that deserves more attention than it gets. The art direction, in particular, just begs for it - from the delightful pixel art to the all-around catchy soundtrack, the developers really did a magnificient job trying to make it all feel like an authentic 8-bit-era experience in that regard. The level design is also one of a kind - the levels are generally long, yet are all really enjoyable. Each one is unique in its own right.\n\nIt is also worth noting that despite drawing huge inspiration from the Castlevania NES classics, this game plays real smooth - so if you aren't really fond of the classic Castlevania games solely because of the extremely tight gameplay, I would naturally suggest giving Odallus a try.\n\nAll in all, Odallus is some genuine fun for both 8-bit era enthusiasts and those into indies in general. It really is a game made out of pure, genuine effort, and one that deserves more appreciation than it gets. If you had some thorough fun with Shovel Knight or Axiom Verge, you should definitely give this one a go.","January 23","true","11.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The animation is also top notch. Every fireball and sword slash looks spot on. I can't say enough about how well Joysmasher made this game look. I have been thoroughly impressed so far with my play-through, and each boss fight brings a new challenge that I find welcoming.\n\nOverall, Odallus: The Dark Call, is a great 8-bit call back; challenging, great to look at, and just damn fun.\n\nFor more Indie Games, Movies, and Music Check out EarlyAccessMedia.com","July 15, 2015","true","1.6"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","16","31","0","0"

In short the game is great. Gameplay, while having nothing really new, feels great. You have your normal sword which you find upgrdes for and three types of sub-weapons. There are no useless things in your inventory, you will find yourself using them at some point.\n\nThe difficulty is decent: it offers a good challenge without becoming a nightmare to live through. What is nightmarish, though, is the enemy design: you can find many kinds of demonic creatures, some of which people might find disturbing. Overall design seems to be inspired by Berserk manga (it's so obvious that even I, who never read it, can see that) which adds more appeal for dark fantasy fans.\n\nUPD. Veteran Mode is out and boy it is hard. New difficulty setting provides an even better challenge, introducing new enemy types and changing power-up locations. However, they also added a lil' bit of fake difficulty: bosses now summon lesser enemies to assist them which often puts you in a situation when the damage cannot be avoided.\n\nI had great fun with this game, and frankly speaking, it's the best Castlevania-like games I played in recent time, deserving a solid 9/10.\nP.S.

Or maybe you have always loved a good side-scrolling challenge with a retro twist… Odallus is calling your name. It’s kind of a dark calling, but it’s there saying hi.\n\nOdallus starts you out on a hunt when you notice something is amiss back at home. You know how it goes though. You see some smoke at your village and you run back as fast as you can, but no matter what you do, it’s always mostly gone before you arrive and all you can do is dig through the rubble. You find out that some cult of weirdos is behind it and they’ve got your kid to boot! There’s only one thing a man with the name of Haggis can do (yes, his name is Haggis and yes it grows on you): grab your sword and go share it with some evil creatures. Well, that’s a start at least right?\n\nThe developers really went out of their way to make Odallus aesthetically old school. Odallus really looks like an 8-bit game. The way the character moves, jumps and attacks all take me back. There is obviously additions to the classic formula like weapon variety combined with the ability to switch between them and lack of pixel jumping like when a cartridge gets old or the system needs cleaning. Some things you can just leave out when you go for this genre though. There is also some secret paths that will have you coming back to the beginning of the game to find the areas with hidden power-ups or different paths to lead you through another way to get to the end.\n\nThe difficulty is probably the main thing that will grab people’s attention and get them to come over to the Odallus side in the first place. (That’s just a big thing currently.) I don’t feel it’s your usual difficulty that some Indie devs have been going for lately. A lot of the time it’s a speed or overabundance of enemies/bullets/spikes that will overwhelm you in most recent “hardcore” sidescrollers. JoyMasher hit the nail on the head with the legitimate retro feel. Odallus’ difficulty seems to be based on your level of patience. Nothing will jump out of a spot that wasn’t there before or what-have-you or force you to move your fingers way faster than you may be able to. It’s a classic “slow and steady wins the race”. When you start getting frustrated and rush into things is when you’ll die. Calm down and take your time and measure your enemies (bosses included). There’s no time limit (thank goodness) so you have no reason to speedrun Odallus… unless that’s your goal. If that’s the case then, hurry up man! There is an achievement after all.\n\nScore: Gewd/Tasty!\n\nI haven’t run into many issues with Odallus: The Dark Call after the few patches they put out a little after I initially downloaded the game and before it officially launched. Since then it’s been smooth sailing and I’ve really enjoyed myself. That, of course, is only because I’ve learned to walk away after a few deaths on the same area. When I get too frustrated I tend to just walk away for a very long time. With a myriad of level types and the ability to obtain new weapons (and suck at using all of them other than the sword) there’s actually a lot to experience here. There are puzzles, platforming and stabbing stuff all while pulling off the retro feel better than most, Odallus is pretty dang good. That’s coming from a guy who doesn’t appreciate too much of a challenge anymore either (I’m getting old and just want to have fun, get off my back!) If you’re looking for a nostalgia trip, a retro-themed game, or just a game that won’t let you be too mindless, Odallus will satisfy your hunger.

Indeed, you should not look to Odallus: The Dark Call if you want to experience the new achievements of mankind in the technology sector. Experience it when you want an unusual "foods" or want to evoke the feeling of playing and the "love" of childhood.\n----------------------------I LOVE---------------------------------\n++++++++OLDSTYLEGAMING+++++++++++\nRight from the first minute experience, Odallus: The Dark Call exudes atmosphere "old" with 8-bit graphics, sounds and motifs monochrome classic hero. Based on the series Castlevania inspiration (2D) or Demon's Crest, simple control mechanism with the movements, jumping, sword or use secondary weapon.\n\nOdallus: The Dark Call no factor should be the actual level of the player work period gave the game their way - more puzzle. In addition to the main task is to destroy all bosses 8 adults, Haggis also to find the secret pathways, the few puzzles (not too hard) to collect the treasure, swords and powerful new armor more. Only when equipped with powerful items, you actually become a "monster" in the game.\n\nEach different enemy brings about a way of moving and a separate attack. It's not just where to hit aggressive encounter that is finished, remember that in addition to the remaining bosses are born to the way people play. Can you kill a few guards but in return you can take a blood clot due to not understand their actions. Instead to flooding "primary love" blood drag you along boss fight, just jump overcome them and go on watching?\n\nHowever, sometimes the "hunt" became reluctant monster, simply because you need to collect a lot of money to buy the network, weapon accessories (torches, axes, spears ...) or recover the amount of blood lost before While wars with such dark knight.\n\nBesides, in my opinion, this is the most interesting thing, food (heals) were very scarce in Odallus: The Dark Call - do not fall off by enemies - should the store become fixed in game very important for the players. So that the frequency of actions and interactions with the surrounding environment is still very lively and not merely byway and "sightseeing".\n\nActually, if you're a gamer experienced, even with play style might be, the game still belongs to you only.\nOverall, Odallus: The Dark Call with fast-paced and intense. The game really has brought the challenge at the peak of the game platform to continually confuse it with you in each screen play - the meticulously arranged - along the segment calculating boss fights.\n------------------------------------DISLIKE----------------------------------------------\n++++++++++++++++SHORTY+++++++++++++++++\nI noticed that a normal player takes a few hours and was able to finish the game no-longer-that anything-to-visit-out again. Not every short too long as well, but the game will record how many the emotions?\nOdallus: The Dark Call really interesting but there is one thing that developer has not done that prolonged duration of play. Just repurposed RPG elements, opens the side quests or may be the "easter eggs", while exploring the warrior Haggis was able to be raised so much.","July 15, 2015","true","9.2"," 7 of 19 people (37%) found this review helpful","37","7","19","0","0"

Though to its credit, you aren't forced to enter a lengthy password afterward.\n\nThe controlls are only marginally less stiff than those of the 8-bit Castlevania games, from which this Odallus is primarily derived. Seriously, do not play this game if you don't like the way the old Castlevania games handled. You even fly backward when you take damage. And yes, there will be water hazards.\n\nOdallus is in need of a quality-of-life patch. I found a menu which can only be exited by scrolling to the bottom of a list, the stage select and "begin stage" functionalities are accessed separately; all things which would have been mildly grating even in the '80s. And to the horror of the TotalBiscuits of the world, the options menu is sparse, and only accessible before the game actually launches.\n\nTechnical problems and bugs: Odallus is picky about controllers. I ended up using an old SNES controller piped through a USB adapter. If you die during a boss fight, you'll occasionally end up with both the boss music and the stage music playing simultaneously. And after the second boss fight, I had to faff around to get the game to accept character input again - I found entering and exiting the start menu worked most reliably. It's worth noting that I began playing in windowed mode after suspecting the game didn't handle alt+tabbing well - some of these bugs may be attributable to that.\n\nI appreciate what they were trying to do - believe me, I do - but this one's a bit low on playability.","January 27","false","2.2"," 8 of 24 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","8","24","0","0"

Much like its contemporary, Shovel Knight, Odallus pays homage to some of the classics of the genre. Visually, it utilizes the best aesthetic sensibilities of NES-era titles like Castlevania to create something that is both atmospheric and complementary to the game's mechanics. It manages to feel authentic and evocative of the NES era without having to actually bend to that system's limitations.\n\nWhere Shovel Knight was clearly influenced, mechanically, by games like Zelda 2, Ducktales, and Mega Man, Odallus feels more influenced by games like Castlevania, Super Metroid, and Demon's Crest. It even brings Dark Souls to mind, in the way the game spreads its checkpoints thin and punishes the player for being impatient.\n\nOdallus is a short game (my save file clocked in just shy of six hours), but never feels padded. I definitely feel like I got my $15 out of it. The difficulty hit a real sweet-spot for me, managing to be just punishing enough to keep me on my toes, and just fair enough in its difficulty to keep me engaged. It's not a technically flawless game (the way the camera snaps in certain levels can be jarring), I found the story to be virtually incomprehensible, and I encountered a few minor bugs, but nothing game-breaking. At the end of the day, I found Odallus to be a thoroughly satisfying game experience.","July 20, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It all looks very good, and sounds quite adequate.\nIts sources are not so obvious, while castlevania is of course cited as a source of inspiration (who doesn't, nowadays?) and while you can indeed spot certain sounds, enemy types and miscellaneous ideas such as breakable walls, Demon's Crest is also brought up, and indeed the overal gameplay does feel like that game minus the flying and long-range attacks, making for engaging and fun gameplay, that starts out easy and slowly ramps up about halfway through the game.\nSpeaking of not-so-obvious sources of inspiration, unless I'm very much mistaken some of the achievements refer to cult-classics such as Fist of the North Star and Highlander, which is a lovely little touch.\nMy only problem with this game is its apparent brevity, for though I haven't finished it yet, I do seem to be at a halfway point at a little over 2 hours.\nAll in all, if stuff like Demon's Crest or Cronenberg's The Fly is what floats your boat, you should do yourself a big favour and get this game, it's a hell of a blast!","July 27, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's sort of a metroidvania but in general you need to go to all branching paths eventually and the only really optional stuff are health and item count upgrades.","September 7, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont know why this was kept under the radar by reviewers, but it is truly a well crafted game that replicates the little things that made the retro era so great. I definitely see heavy influences from both Castlevania and Metroid, and that's just fine with me.","January 23","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Classic Metroidvania gameplay with a lot of secrets, tight controls, and a great design aesthetic.  Love the music too.  Overall feel of game is awesome.  More people need to support these devs, their love of classic gaming shines through in Odallus.  Please buy","May 31","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Story is not cumbersome but there's a unique mystery to it. Shaping up to be one of my all time favorite games on Steam.\n\nMy one little gripe is that the launcher prevents me from using the in-home streaming feature smoothly, which I use to play on projector. But if that doesn't bother you the game is awesome.","June 5","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
