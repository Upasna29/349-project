At the time, it revolutionzed what it meant to be an RTS and remains to this day one of the greats. Despite its age, it is still easy to slip into and play if you're wanting to dive into a Total War binge. The variety of third-party mods also make sure that it never gets boring.\n\nAlexander adds a single campaign that's somewhat enjoyable.  While it's not up to the level of Barbarian Invasion, it's still worth the few dollars it costs.","December 4, 2013","true","9.2"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","63","70","3","1"

This could actually be used hand-and-hand with the Art of War, a good manual that could give you assistance on battles when it comes to the other Total War games, and commanding in general. This expansion is really what got me into the aspects of battle other than fighting, to read the Art of War, and even to look into the political aspects of war. Truly a good introduction into an amazing commander, this will teach you a lot about more than just killing in war. Give it a try, and if you don't like it, it's just a couple of bucks.","September 13, 2015","true","9.8"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","37","41","4","0"

I, as a fan of Alexander, liked this expansion a lot, but it definitely has it's cons; one playable faction in the campaign, 7 factions altogether, a lot of minor bugs, and a hard campaign. However, I feel that the campaign's difficulty is a welcome break from the relatively easy campaigns of the base game. The pros of this DLC: Cool unit designs, good historical accuracy, a break from the Rome-based timeline of the base game and Barbarian Invasion, and an interesting challenge campaign-wise. However, I only recommend this game to seasoned Rome Total War players because of it's difficulty.\n\nOverall, 6/10.","May 17, 2014","true","12.4"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","35","38","2","0"

Rome total war is a huge, stunning game and all of its DLC expansion packs are great....except....arr, I can't say this one is sadly. I can't do a huge review because this game is so small and pointless. The campaign is different, but its difference is completely flawed. Not enough factions and a cradling Alexander mission complex make it a race to defeat everything on the map. It just boils down into one crappy campaign that is not diplomatically strategic and the battles that don't even have all the Ancient Factions. This game could be spared the humiliation due to its low price, but the Barbarian expansion and the full game have set the bar so high it should be jam packed with more content and historical context (as certain reviewers have pointed out, I'm only an Ancient Roman expert sadly). There are some good points within it though, I'll mention them for the sake of it-\n-Price\n-Different campaign format\n-Units\n\nThat’s about it. The other DLC pack is far better and if bought on Steam comes with the full game (Gold Edition). Being a history fan I wouldn't care about the price, but this expansion is so bad I have to complain. This is the difference in the packs-\n- Campaign map size\n- Faction selection\n- Diplomacy\n- Long campaign time\n- Historical accuracy\nAll these favour the other pack so the only reason to get this game is if you care about the Alexandra period greatly. I can't believe they advertised this next to the Barbarian Invasion pack, it’s a joke.\n\nI rate this game a low -2/5 or 12/100 or 6% and would never ever recommend it as it’s an offence to the main game and the other expansion pack. As all the randomly generated NPC rumours on Elder Scrolls Oblivion Say- It’s a disgrace!","February 20, 2014","false","1.3"," 14 of 26 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","14","26","2","0"

Its primary problem is that, while playing, it feels unfinished; like medieval total war II: Kingdoms, it does not retain the ability to build from recently captured settlements nor allows any kind of deplomacy to have an effect on the outcome of the game. Alexander strictly plays by the history books, which in one instance is fine, as it does, in a way, make the game realistic, but in the base game the course of history has no leverage. You can decide to destroy Rome if so chosen or take Rome further than it had ever gone. In my opinion that is the whole point of why Rome Total War was and is so fantastic. In addition to not changing history, as it were, the player can only choose Macedonia as a faction. Persia and the various tribes of India, let alone the rest of the conquerable world as was known to Alexander the Great, are non-playable factions.

Before I criticise Alexander I do understand the premise and having played later total war games I can see that this is an early attempt at creating a "Historical Campaign" or rather a campaign with a clear story ark. I therefor view Alexander very much as Total War's fist attempt at this kind of story telling campaign, something that was only realised in Napoleon TW which was, in effect, a large linear campaign story.\n\nWhile Alexander's gameplay is exhalent, in line with the rest of the Rome generation, I feel that to say it is any more than an average game is, I feel, a gross exaduration. The campaign is relatively short; allows little time for you to do as you please in regards to your personal experience of the campaign and is tiresome in parts. I felt that after the initial stages of the campaign (gaining a foothold in Asia) the battles became repetitive and the A.I. predictable. I also felt that the campaign was very short and couldn't hold a candle to Rome or BI's campaigns.\n\nCustom battles are also poor with only four available factions it is easy to get bored. Macedon massively over powered, Its pikes make a mockery of most Persian units. Persia its self does have a wide array of unique and new units but they are, in my experience hard to use effectively on the battlefield. India is in my opinion a pointless addition to the game aside from elephants its armies are pitiful and it doesn't appear in the campaign.\n\nIn summary I see the point of Alexander as an important experiment for total war however for me it is a solid 3 or 4 out of 10 despite some redeeming features such as narration from Brian Blessed.\n","April 6, 2014","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fun! There are new units befitting the setting (a few decades before the beginning of the main game), and some voiceovers by BRIAN BLESSED.\n\nAnyway, if you liked Rome 1 and want a little extra campaign to go with it, then go ahead and grab it. When this was new this might have been a disappointing purchase in comparison to the first expansion Barbarian Invasion (included within the Steam Version of Rome) which added vastly more content. But.. this is just fine now since it's cheap. :3","December 21, 2013","true","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Unlike the original game itself this will take place in a far East, where you are destent to conquer the mighty Persian Empire with your superior: but outnumbered Macedonian elite forces. Using the same engine as the Rome: Total War, battles in this game run very smoothly and the gameplay is simple and fun.\nThe expansion is about Alexanders conquest and that is what the game does: it delivers what it promises. That means only a few factions and a really straightforward campaign. (If you wanna play bigger variation of factions then theres the  Rome: Total War for that.) But unlike the original game, this expansion delivers a different, quite difficult challenge. In Rome: Total War - Alexander, you have to worry about the age of your Faction leader, deal with the lack of reinforsments and face the wrath of the Persian Empire, while trying to defend your cities from the barbarian hordes.\nAll and all this is a expansion, that delivers different gameplay and bigger challenge, with a quality of the Rome: Total War.\n\n3/5 who said anything about the legionares?

I still had a lot of fun playing the campaign tho. So if you really want a total war expansion based on Alexander the Great then I would recommend this expansion. Otherwise it does not offer a lot. I still had to run the game in borderless mode like total war Rome which is disappointing. I do admit I had fun leading Alex's campaign.","May 16","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
