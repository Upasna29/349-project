You need to be extremely good for higher difficulty levels . After all video games need to be challenging , they are more fun that way . DA was tougher than SE .\n\nC - Combat - ♥♥♥♥in amazing , its so much fun to hurl enemies into air , use them as a skateboard , mixing devil arms and melee weapons in the combat and beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of enemies . Style play  promotes  chaining of combos . Use of different styles , different weapons and devil arms brings variety in combat and gives fresh and fantastic experience . They just nailed it in this department , style switcher mod for pc takes it to next level . There so many brilliant combo videos on youtube and all are  amazing .\n\nB - Boss Fights - Boss fights are simply outstanding . Agni&Rudra , Nevan , Beowulf , Dante's shadow , Vergil fights etc ( one of the best boss ever )  all are amazing . No cutscene , qte ♥♥♥♥ just pure dope gameplay . You have to learn their moves and fight effectively . Bosses are designed well too and give  sense of achievement after beating them . Normal enemies are not that great and not that bad and there is a room for improvement . Loved vergil's and doppelganger's taunts .\n\nA - Action - Right in your face intense action . Amazing combat , style play and hordes of enemies keep the action going on . Few puzzles are here and there which save your fingers from getting sore . DMC3 is all about cool & stylish moves/action . DMC3 is one of the best action games ever made .\n\nS- Story - Pretty straightforward story , DMC3 focuses more on action/combat and this what i expect from a action game . Minimal story and loads of gameplay . Cutscenes are top notch and action packed esp. when dante gets devil trigger . Vergil & The Lady cutscenes are equally epic .\n\n\nSS - Sick Soundtrack - Battle theme pumps you up and with metal in the background and action going on the screen , one can never go wrong  . Metal + action games combo  gives birth to amazing gaming experience  . Battle theme do get repetitve and sometimes it gets irritating . Vergil 3 and doppelganger themes are great . Last but not the least , just listen to Devils never cry . So ♥♥♥♥in gooooood\n\n\nSSS - SonS of Sparda - Both Dante and vergil are fantstic characters , esp. Dante . Their chemistry is so interesting , both are twins but completely opposite to each other and whenever they interact its fun watch them . Dante is such a badass character with bring it on attitude and vergil on the other hand calm and more  deadly foe .Their design is pretty great too with old school red vs blue touch . No words to describe the battles between them , play it and experience it . Unarguably one of the best combination and boss fight . Rarely you have a opponent who is equally as powerful as you and defeats you . Being your own brother makes things more heated up( only in game :P )\n\nPc port is bad but can be fixed easliy with few fixes , thanks to modding community . Replay value  is great with playable vergil ,  bloody palce mode and ofcourse trying different styles and maximizing them .\n\nMasterpiece 9.9/10","January 4, 2015","true","30.9"," 172 of 183 people (94%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","94","172","183","36","6"

In fact, this port is so bad it's one of the only instances I would recommend playing it on console over PC, or emulate it if you can't do that.

DO NOT BUY!!!!!(Fixes for this game are at the bottom of the review. Click on the link) DO NOT GET ON PC!!!! Get the HD Collection on PS3 or Xbox 360 instead. This Game is an AMAZING Game. However, the PC Port of this game is HORRIBLE!!!!! the controlls don't work right and you have to do a ton of unecessary fixes just to have some functionality, not even full functionality. and the resolution is about the same resolution as the original PS2 game so it will not play in HD or in any wide aspact ratio. This is a total waste of your hard earned money. your better off getting the "Devil May Cry HD Collection" on PS3 or Xbox 360 where u get the first 3 original DMC games including this one, the controls flow like you where born to play this game, and the resolution is FULL HD! now that is a WAY BETTER buy then this PC version piece of crap. keep in mind that DMC 4 and DMC:Devil May Cry (Remake) works amazing on PC so just becuase this one sucks on PC doesn't mean the other 2 on pc are bad as well. I would recommend DMC 4, and DMC Reamake over this game aswell. Have fun with those other DMC Games. :)\n\nI HAVE AMAZING NEWS!!! this link at the bottom of the review will help you fix every single problem this game can dish out! :D. it's in the steam forums. if you really want this game, than you have to see this link. This link will give you everything! how to get full controller functionality, get the proper resolution in game in full screen, and more. this is highly recomended for more advance computer users so, be warned, some of this fixes for some people aren't easy but for most it should be a piece of cake ;) have fun!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/6550/discussions/0/864969320373351964/#p1","November 30, 2013","false","3.0"," 246 of 347 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","246","347","2","8"

Fullscreen works by pressing ALT+Enter (maybe not while in the menu or title screen or cutscene, but ingame), widescreen support is available via a hack. On some systems, the resolution may be limited to 640x480 or 800x600, but that is not the normal behaviour. You should get the highest 4:3 resolution closest to your native resolution without a patch. XBox controllers are not officially supported because this game uses directinput for controller support, which is the predecessor to xinput. If you have one of the recent Logitech gamepads (F310 for example), you can choose between directinput and xinput via a hardware switch on the controller, then map the controller keys correctly (setup controller) and the game works out of the box. If you have to use an xbox compatible controller, you have to fiddle around to get the trigger keys working. This is because the trigger keys are analog and on the same axis on the xbox compatible controllers, but are two seperate digital keys on the older standard. Please note that this game was developed before the xbox compatible controllers had been invented! It would have been nice of Capcom to have this version revamped like they did for PS3 and XBox, but they have not.  It is not optimized for the PC and it is an old game, but I still think it is awesome.","December 27, 2013","true","132.3"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","53","66","0","0"

Dante is then attacked by lessor demons but quickly (and stylishly) kills them all and this starts the events of the game and overall the story is pretty good best in the series has some insane motioncapture and good voice acting (compared to DMC1 and DmC this is oscar worthy)\n\n\nSecond the styles - You can choose between four different styles which are Swordmaster where your melee weapons have more moves, do more damage and let you combo in the air easily, Gunslinger lets you use your guns in extremely stylish ways from spinning in mid air while fireing down to curb stomping a demon while shooting him in the head and its a pleasure to watch the animations, Royalguard works as a block button but it doesn't stop there sure you can block and take reduced damage but if you perfectly time your block you can absorb all damage and release it in a extremely damaging attack that if you build enough damage up you can instant kill some of the tougher demons, Trickster gives you another type of dodge, a teleport, a air dash and the ability to run on walls, Trickster can be used to create insane combos if you know what you're doing. There are two other styles quicksilver and doppleganger which let you slow down time and create a copy of yourself and thats about it but if used right are deadly (doppleganger unlocks a hidden two player mode to)\n\n\nThird the combat - The combat in this game is insanely fun with a total of 5 devil arms (melee weapons) and 5 fire arms (guns) for Dante and the ability to bring any combination of weapons (two devil arms two fire arms) and one of 6 styles to choose from this game has a crazy ammount of depth in its combat especailly since all weapons and styles (except doppleganger and quicksilver) can be upgraded and gain more moves.\n\n\nFourth Extras - With the special edition you are able to play as Vergil who has 3 devil arms and no fire arms but shoots summond swords instead and a single style (he has less depth then Dante but is fun to play) After you beat the game once you can start a new game as Vergil you will be given a cutscene that takes place before DMC3 but don't get your hopes up he ends up going through the same levels as Dante (from the Devil May Cry all the way to hell) The style switcher mod does work on Vergil but you can only use dark slayer (Default style) and Dante's quicksilver style (due to the other styles not working right or them already being a part of Dark Slayer)\n\nFifth should you buy it - In short yes you should buy this game...... if you have a playstation 2 the pc version is a extremely bad port and it is fixable (I fixed it after spending over 10 hours configureing it) it just takes a lot of time and a lot of reading user guides on how to fix it. On the brightside of the pc version is the ability to mod and the famous style switcher mod (go get it now) which lets you change to any of the 6 styles at any time in game without having to stop at a statue to change them (it also comes with other features that let you customize the game further but I won't get into that)\n\nIf you use a controller be prepared to break it in half with your teeth out of pure rage when you find out the triggers don't work and the sticks are reversed (right stick moves you left stick turns camera) there are fixes for this but they don't always work and if you are useing Motioninjoy be prepared to just quit (I made a discussion post on how to fix a ps3 controller with motioninjoy but if you are useing any other controllers good luck to you)\n\nI also hope you have a somewhat decent computer cause this game runs like hell the framerate is subpar and requires you to delete audio files (really?) to get the framerate up but it stops the badass soundtrack from playing if you do so (luckly for me my computer can handle it)\n\n\nFinal - Do i recommend this game? again yes if you can get a console copy or if you are willing to spend 10+ hours fixing it, if you have no choice but to buy it on PC buy it when it goes on sale it usualy drops down to $7.50 but this is one of my favorite games of all time it just has a bad pc port","February 16, 2015","true","52.3"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","15","22","0","0"

It's not entirely unplayable as some may lead you to believe, but it's bad enough to make you want to not play the game despite how fun it is.\nMost console controllers will refuse to work for the game and what DOES work will leave you wanting more, such as not being able to use one of your joysticks. You CAN download a program to fix this and it's really not the main issue with the port because it can be fixed. The real problem comes from the fact that you will have massive, and I mean MASSIVE fps drops in multiple locations resulting in it being neigh unplayable.\nBut in those non-large areas where fps is stable and you fix the controller up, it works rather well for a port.\n\nI wouldn't recommend it because it's far too much work to get everything in working condition.\n(At this point there might even be a fix for the FPS drops but I didn't care to look for it)\n\nTHAT ALL BEING SAID\nIf you don't have a problem with everything I said, feel free to pick up this game.","November 30, 2013","false","3.0"," 52 of 92 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","52","92","0","0"

Everything about this game is rediculous.  The combat, the story, the cutscenes, it's all over the top crazy action, and I love it.  I bought this on Steam to try to replay it with some better graphics, but unfortunately, this game was not optimized for PC at ALL.\n\nController support is awful, you CAN get some of them to work, but it isn't easy, and you have to a lot of research to find out how to get it to work.\n\nGraphics are technically better than they were on the PS2, but widescreen support is not built in, so if you are one of the normal PC users that have a 16:9 or 16:10 screen, you will have blackbars on the sides of the screen.  There is a mod to 'fix' this, but it basically just stretches the screen, so it looks awful.\n\nCapcom didn't try very hard on the PC version of this game, which is unfortunate, because it's one of the best DMC's.  Try Devil May Cry 4 or DMC, they have way better support, so they know how to do it right, just not wortgh their effort to fix this version I guess.\n\nTL;DR version - Great game, but badly ported.

(Also it's pretty challenging so, if you don't like handholding- this is the game for you)\n\nI've had and played this game for about 4 years now, and still love it dearly. (Although it only says 30 hours on Steam, I also played it a lot on PS3 later).\nBut recently I came to notice how low the Steam ratings for this game were, and I read through the reviews to see why.\nFrom what I've seen, it's all in regards to the port itself, which is understandable.\nI've personally never had a problem running the game on Steam (even without downloading patches or anything).\n\nThat said, I do think that the in-game references to the controls are complete jank, because they are based on a\nnumbering system for buttons that VERY unclear. This can be solved by a simple google search to see what each button\ndoes. I don't think the frame-rate is optimal (especially for a hack and slash) but it's not unplayable,\nI really didn't notice it all that much when I first got into the game, but only after I'd had my share of a variety\nof hack and slash games and really came to know the genre, did I notice the difference.\nI also never had a problem using a controller as the controller scheme menu is actually pretty easy to understand,\nalthough customization is a bit annoying.\n\nIn summary:\nI guess from my experience, I'd say the game is still worth is, especially during Steam Sales, assuming that you can run it.\nLike I said, it is a bit jank here and there, and it's not an excellent port by any means, but if you are looking to have a\nhack and slash game that's easy to run on most computers just to casually play whenever, this is the game for you.","February 25","true","31.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Wtf man? Ok - without checking forums (and I should never have to do that) it won't run in anything other than ♥♥♥♥♥♥ windowed mode. It's not designed to, or adapted to, 360 compatible joysticks which is pretty much the only stick anyone has. Sure you can reconfigure the joystick but you'll have to remember  what the hell button 4 or 7 or 2 is, and there's no guide or helpful hint so you're just left stabbing in the dark. The only way to get the game working properly (and i'm not sure that I can) is going to be if i go and check forum posts - that just shoudn't happen. It should work perfectly out of the box for the vast majority of setups. They haven't even tried. I should have known after the Ducktales affair (where Capcom released a game that they KNEW was fundamentally broken) that Capcom were going to butt♥♥♥♥ me on this one but like a fool I thought it couldn't be THAT bad. Boy was I wrong.\n\n\nBuy it if you want an example of how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and lazy a port can be. Otherwise avoid like the plague.\n\nEDIT: After checking the forums you can apparently edit the ini file to get the 360 controller working kindasorta but for some it doesn't work and too bad if you're not comfy with editing files like that.Then you need the styleswitcher mod to get the most of the game, And then, no matter how beastly your pc, there are a couple of points where there's really bad framerate drops due to *gasp* music playing. Once you get through all that...it's apparently not too bad.\n\nThe sad fact is that Capcom could and should easily release a patch that would fix the 360 controller problem. But they won't. Why? Because they are a pack of something that ryhmes with punts.\n\nSo still a big no go from me. And it'll be a cold day in hell before I buy another Capcom game.","May 15","false","0.3"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","2"

It strayed from the formula that made the first AWESOME! and Devil May Cry 3 came right back to it. With this port though you are definitely going to have to tweek the controls to match the playstation controller to the one on the PC but once you get past that headack, let the fun begin! I usually don't like overly challenging games but this series changed my mind for it. Who doesn't like hacking and slashing while jumping about and then BLAM! you whip out dual guns and start wailing on everything!?! This game wasn't just mindless shooting and slashing either, all the enemies had specific weakness that if you didn't exploit left you working twice as long and frantic to put them down. This game doesn't mind overwelming you either if you start to get careless and charge into the middle of a group of enemies because as bad as you are in this game, stupid dies quickly.

Yes, there's no denying that, but it's not THAT bad of a PC port. Sure, it takes a while to get the mandatory controller set up, the frames drop quite a bit, it can't go fullscreen, etc., but it's still a good game. Forget about how bad of a PC port it is, and concentrate on the game itself. It's awesome.

However, this port is completely unacceptable. Japanese video game companies aren't exactly known for great first attempts at PC porting, and Capcom is no exception. They DID more than make up for it with DMC4 and DmC, with the PC ports being the superior versions of the game, but this is one I can't whole-heartedly recommend. If you picked up the DmC Complete Pack, you basically got this one for free, but since that bundle no longer seems to exist, I can't recommend this, especially not as a single purchase. Unless you're one of the PC Master Race and refuse to own even what is possibly the best console of all time, drop by a GameStop and pick this game up from a used games bin, for a better experience and a much more reasonable asking price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alucard86/recommended/6550/","alucard86","AlucarD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alucard86/","166 products in account","Let's have a look on one of Capcons most action loaded games Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition for the PC.\n\nPlatform: PC\nPublisher: Ubisoft\nDeveloper: Capcom\nGenre: Fantasy Action Adventure\nRelease Date: Oct 16, 2006\n\nStory: The story so far plays earlier than the orginal Devil May Cry game for the PS2. Its's about the half devil Dante Sparda who tries once again to save the world from the influence of the devil possesed Arkham\nand his horde of undead creatures from hell. In this game there is also some very cool new character introduced named Vergil Sparda who is actually Dantes evil twinbrother and most fearsome foe.\nVirgil works together with Arkham in order to open the gate of hell which was closed long years ago by Dantes father the legandary Devil Knight Sparda. So Dante starts his journey to climb up the unholy tower of evil called "The Temen-Ni-Gru" which is summoned by Arkham in order to connect the human world to the demon world. On his way up he crosses lines with a strange woman called Lady who tries to shoot him on sight.\nThe whereabouts of the Temen-Ni-Gru as well as the identity of lady seem very dark and unclear. What the end offers... i can't tell, just play to find out :D 8/10\n\nGameplay: DMC3-Se is a third perspective fantasy action adventure which combines very fast gameplay with lots of combos and various puzzles throughout the game. The fighting system is devided in "styles" which\nDante can switch between Missions and also level them up to perform even greater combos. There are also special obiects called orbs to collect as well as a very great varaety of fire and melee weapons throughout the game. 8/10\n\nControls: This is one of the main problems with the PC version of DMC3-Se because its totally bugged and you need a patch in order to convert the right keyboard comands to some gamepad. 4/10\n\nGraphic: This is unfortunately another minus for the PC port as you will see some graphics in ingame arent drawn very correctly as the PS2 version and also some parts of the game seem pretty greyscale due to the direct X output of your PC, nevertheless the FMV movies are really great. 7/10\n\nSound: I have to mention that the sound is absoluty awesome. DMC3-Se brings some very good soundtrack and very nice soundsamples combined with very thrilling metal music. 9/10\nMy Review: First of all I have to say that I have played only the PC version of DMC3-Se hench I am writting this review for the PC version of that great game.\nThe game starts right of in Dantes office with one of the most impressive and action loaded FMV movies I saw so far. After the nice introducing of the control tutorial you are directly thrown into action to kick some demon butts. You will learn very fast the combos and special attacks if you play the first time through this game. Actually you can change between 4 styles called Trickster, Gunslinger, Royal Guard and Swordmaster. As the names describe, each style is bound to some very cool and unique special attack and combos. For example if you like using long range weapons than you can choose Gunslinger for improving your shoot abillities but if you prefer short range you can go along with Swordmaster. All in one I really liked the style system and the idea of combining different styles. So after you have killed tons of demons and alot of other evil guys you will be introduced step by step through very cool FMV movies to the story of this game which is in my opinion really great. The game is divided in 20 Missions, and you will come across some very cool and though bosses, one remarcable of them will be Dantes twinbrother Virgil who actually seems to interfere with Dante on purpose. The boss fights are one big plus in this game because they really deliever some thrilling and decent difficulty (at least if you play on very hard or Dante must die mode). What I really liked about this game is the character developement its really different from DMC2 which was... to put it bluntly "it sucked". I would generally say that the difficulty in this game is fair and really depends on what scale you play. I beat this game on hard mode in 9 hours but some other guys sure need between 15 - 20 hours. Also after beating the entire game you can unlock Vergil as a playable character, and this is included in the Special edition only as well as some other nice feature I will mention beneath.\n\nSo what are the differences between the original Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening and Devil May Cry 3 : Dantes Awakening Special Edition you may ask ?\n\nWell here they are:\nDifficulties:\n\n- Easy mode\n- Hard mode\n- Very Hard mode\n- Dante Must Die mode\n- Heaven or Hell mode\n\nPlayable Character:\n\n- "Vergil" is playable after beating the game once with Dante. He brings his own uniqe styles as well as flying swords as his long range weapons.\n\nExtra Mode:\n\n- "Bloody Palace" is available after beating the game once with Dante, its some kind of battle arena where you are thrown in with a limited supply of orbs and must fight random enemies and bosses.\n\nExtra Outfits:\n\n- 4 new costumes for Vergil unlockable\n- 6 new outfits for Dante unlockable\n\nGallery:\n\n-you can unlock diverse Artwork and CGI work form DMC3 here\n\nDemo Digest:\n\n- You can preview all Ingame Movies from here\n- There is also some timelimit in the end of the game where you can beat 100 enemies in order to unlock a hidden ending\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n- There are different locations in the game where you know can fight Jester (its that annoying clown BTW)\n- Lady wears some fency new suit depending on the outfit you choose in Ingame\n- There is a yellow and gold option at the beginning of the game which allows to use the yellow orbs as restore point after dieing.\nThese are the differences available in the Special Edition of DMC3 as well for the PS2 version as for the PC version which was only released as the Special edition by the way.\n\nFInal Words: DMC3 SE sure is some special game for fans of the Devil May Cry series as well as for action fans who like fast and flashy gamplay combined with metal music and gothic ambience. I was very pleased about the importation of this game to the PC and really forgot fast about the undeveloped control settings which is a pain in the ♥♥♥♥ indeed for people who wants to play the PC version on a gamepad. All I can say is that you should stick with the PS2 version if you are a die hard fan of DMC as for me I also liked the PC version therefore I give this game a 7 out of 10.\n\nEndrating: 7/10","December 25, 2013","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

With the six different programs I've downloaded to run this one game with a Playstation 3 controller, I can finally use my four basic buttons, but having to use the right analog stick to move Dante and the left analog stick to move the camera is torturous. I found myself using the right analog stick with my left thumb just to be able to move around. I understand that this game is old and has never worked right, but if Valve is to sucker people like me out of their money for it 9 years later, I think it's about time it got fixed.

This is a very shoddy console port with the controller arbitrarily mapped to the keyboard without any thought about how it might play. You can remap them but you can't use the mouse. Eventually with help from the forums I managed to configure enough of the controls to a controller for it to be playable. Once I got the game working the difficulty of this game is horrible and the button combos for special moves terrible. Eventually once you have died a few times it unlocks easy mode. Only at this point does the game become fun. It has an enjoyable story and excellent level design. Dante manages to come across as confidently awesome where it would have been very easy to be arrogant and hateable. So whether you buy this game or not depends upon you think it is worth the rigmarole of getting it up and running.","February 9, 2014","false","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Unfortunately however this port to the PC is an insult to this legendary game from its god awful controller layout where community members have to manually add their own layout fixes to this lazy port and along with that at  times crappy frame rate issues have occured regardless of how powerful my pc is. For those new to the series PLEASE do not buy this port! I highly recommened instead buying it either for the PS2 or the HD collection for the XBOX 360/PS3 to see how amazing this game really is.\n\nEDIT 16/01/15: A mod called "style switcher" for this PC port has literally fixed almost every issue completely, it makes the game look 10 times better with fog and gamma fixes, fixing the terrible controller button layout, 1080p support (making it sharper and more crisp than the HD collections DMC 3) and widescreen, even allowing you to switch styles with both Dante and Vergil just like in Devil May Cry 4!!!\nUnfortunately however the framerate issue still applies, but this can be fixed by removing a select amount of audio files (but that means less badassery during combat :c).\nIf you ever (though i'd still not recommend this crappy port) decide to get this PC port please mod it with the style switcher mod!","March 31, 2014","false","7.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

As of combat, it's 1 button to rule them all, why use anything besides your sword attack, if the only other attack you have is weak guns, only used for maintaining your combo, or your "style" attack, which does barely anything. And for those of you who say, "well this dante is better than the one in DMC", I do not see much difference, except that this dante in fact, does not even care about anything, his emotions feel faked, he's not even a prick, who is like "oh you stepped on my pizza, now I'm mad", but he's like "oh you stepped on my pizza, this party is gonna be good". What kind of response is that?\n\nAlso, even if you get a controller working, the spaces and invisible walls your camera has to deal with, make an overview of the battlefield impossible.\n\nFor once, I think an AAA sequel of a game has been better than the old ones.\n\nOh, something popped up in my mind, this game is made for square screen resolutions.

Here are all the problems: no fullscreen, choppy music, terrible/nonexistent keyboard controls (you literally can't navigate the menu w/ a keyboard), and ONLY three crappy resolution options. Oh but we aren't done, there's more to this crapshoot. Once you do get a controller to play this game, you better hope you got a PS3 controller, otherwise you have to manually edit files in the game to get an Xbox 360 controller working--but guess what! This still won't solve the control problems! The camera controls are nearly nonexistent. R3 snaps the camera to Dante's back, sometimes. Terrain/walls/obstacles within a level will stop the camera in its tracks whether you're using R3 or the stick itself (which pans the camera at a snail's pace). In a notoriously difficult game, this is unacceptable since you will be getting attacked offscreen. Yeah, it only cost me a few dollars, but I'd have been better off using my money as fuel for a fire.

Not only that, but they work just fine, so ignore the idiots that are too lazy to solve problems and just write an angry review after 10 minutes.\n\nAbout the actual game, the port has some problems with some lag in a few areas. It's not excessive lag that will affect gameplay, but it will slow down the game for a second. One spot I can think of off the top of my head is the area on Mission 7 where you have to jump down to enter the library. I noticed slightly more lag with Vergil, but again, it did not affect areas where I was actually fighting enemies. There are also fixes for the lag if it seems like it's actually affecting your gameplay, so again, if you plan on getting this game, take a couple minutes to look for some common questions and answers. It's a good game and you don't need a console to play it, so there's no point in throwing a hissy-fit when you encounter small problems with the port.\n\n\n\n","July 5, 2015","true","262.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

I love Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition. It is a fantastic hack n'slash game that I can recommend to anyone. However, don't get the PC version because of the controller compatibility issues. Any regular controller, like for example a logitech gamepad, the game will say that the controller import is not compatible with the game. The button layout that the game expects you to use as the default control settings is beyond terrible. Now you can map the buttons on the controller for different commands, but the game does not recognize the left and right triggers as buttons. The only way to make your controller sync up with Devil May Cry 3 is to download a program like Xpadder and customize your own default controls setting and then sync that to the game. The thing is you'll have to shell out $10.00 to download Xpadder. So that will be the determining factor if you want to by the game or not. Personally, I'd get any other version of Devil May Cry 3: Special Edition over the PC version.","June 4, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So when I saw the PC port, I put it on my wishlist because I've only heard good things about DMC and I love Dante's wit and sarcasm.\nI should have read the reviews first, and then removed it so that my good friends didn't waste their money getting it for me.\nI can't tell if having a gamepad or a controller would have made any difference or not. I spent the first, probably, 15-20 minutes trying to figure out what keys did what, and then trying to configure them to what could best suit me.\nBut it was futile.\nThis port is beyond unplayable in the state it's in right now, at least for me(I don't know about anyone else). It wouldn't even let me past the "Style Selection" menu because when I'd press 3 to select, it would just move the cursor down the list of fighting styles.\nI gave up. I'm probably never going to be able to play this game unless Capcom and Steam release an updated, BETTER, port because of the "sensitive" nature of the game. At least I was given 3 and 4, and from what I've read, 4 is at least an okay port. I'm very disappointed in the lack of effort that was clearly put into this release, though.\n\nTL;DR: Don't buy the port unless you're good at coding and are willing to dig deep and research how to make this game dance for you. Buy the DMC HD collection instead if you can get the platform for it.\n","December 25, 2013","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I love the Gold edition to play around as Vergil.  I love the music and, despite the games plot always being ridiculous and hammy, this is one of the better plots I could get invested in (though I haven't completed 4 yet so my opinion might change...."might" ).\n\n*clears throat* ...with that said; I love the game (on PS2 or PS3).  This port to the steam (currently) is NON-PLAYABLE (unless you PC players are truly experts on playing action games like this on a Keyboard and don't mind wearing out or breaking your keys).  So far, it doesn't matter what Gamepad you are using; I've tried the PC Microsoft Xbox controller and using a gamepad program to make my PS3 and PS2 controller work on my comptuer (and I have made it work for several games without problems INCLUDING some where I had to custom input the functions for each buttons)...but it is STILL UNPLAYABLE.  Most of the functionatlly still works; the sword/gun/jump/camera/taunt/tricks button can still be used properly and rearranged on the game's setup screen like normal,,,but the Analog sticks DO NOT WORK CORRECTLY.\n\nThat's the only real problem at this time (which is why I can't comment on anything else graphical or compatibile-wise because I'm stuck in level 1).  The left analog stick does NOT function at all for this game.  For some reason you have to move with the right stick; but even if THAT functioned correctly I don't think most players could play this game at all like this.  And it's STILL bad because the only thing you can do to move is either left or right (or just up or down).  Either way; you can NOT move properly to enjoy playing this port.\n\nI'm not officially ready to say this Port SUCKS, because I am REALLY hoping Valve/Steam team are getting feedback like this and tell them they need to fix/patch the control schemes if anyone is to ever play this port at all.  Otherwise; for now until they do so, Do NOT purchase this game unless you more of a game collector building up your library.\n\n(To note: I have read some of the Steam user's guides to set-up your gamepad controller for it to work properly and said they had success...but I've tried and retried several times and I don't think the Game itself will register it at all, only keeping to what it's currently control functions are...which is crap.  Also, the port does come with a Gamepad Config that will NOT RECOGNIZE the Xbox controller...it recognized my PS controller, but nothing was accomplished as I hoped.  Plus, there is a option to switch/Reverse the L and R analog sticks...but it didn't do anything at all! ).","November 27, 2013","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Very badly made without thinking from the perspective of the PC player control ergonomics either using keyboard or gamepad.\n\nGRAPHICS\nThe graphics are typical of the older Play Station games (think of Resident Evil 2 and 3, except that background buildings are also in 3D). It's dated for 2015, but nothing sinful from when it was originally released.\n\nBut the sinful thing in here is that there is no fullscreen mode. It can only be viewed in windowed mode. Max resolution is at 1600x1200. (Even DOS games has fullscreen).\n\nSOUND\nIt's ok. From the intro to the rock tunes of the (in-game) broken jukebox, it does fine. Positional audio was not used.\n\nCONTROLS\nIt's a bad port mainly because the control scheme is unbearably bad... keyboard or XBox controller.\n\nWith the keyboard, you can configure the key map. The problem with using the keyboard is that [Jump] is reflected as [Style Action]. Pressing [Style Action] is still [Style Action]. I can't make Dante jump.\n\nButtons can also be configured with the XBox controller... except for the directional movement which is unfortunately placed to the Right analog stick. Forget about no rumble feature. I just want to move the character properly, which I can't.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nIt has a lot of potential and I can feel that this could have been a good game. Camera control poorly done as well, though. I can only reset the camera view to it's default location. I can't do anything else with it.\n\nOVERALL\nI can't even play it, so I can't recommend it at all. The DMC franchise has gone a long way, but unless they've made the controls better, it is probably best to play the older parts of the franchise in the console rather than the PC.","December 24, 2014","false","0.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I played it over and over and over again when I originally bought it back in the day. So when I saw it on Steam I was stoked. This port though. Seriously, this port is bad. You have to change .ini files to even try to make an xbox controller work for it and to get the resolution to something decenet. And even then it doesn't always work. If you're willing to put in the time to find a work around the game is still intact and fun, but if you aren't willing to track down the fixes you might want to just play it on an old PS2 or buy the current potato version that's out there. Because this is awful. Seriously, why map movement to the right stick and not make that something that you can alter. It's not even an option in the .ini file. That's just stupid. I still love the game, this port is stupid bad though.","July 18, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

Then even if you go try to change the controls, your not allowed to switch the two sticks, and you have to take half an hour to decode their labelling system of the ♥♥♥♥ing buttons - instead of using the universally accepted A, B, X, Y, or any of the buttons from any other commonly used controller, their buttons are labelled 1 to 11. And since your not allowed to use the triggers on the controller, theres only 10 buttons on the ♥♥♥♥ing controller, so I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ button 11 is.

The story is still good, and the game itself is as enchanting as the console versions - but the partial controller support is a big pain in the butt.\n\nNot to mention all of the mods you would need to download, figure out, and install just to put it on the same level as Devil May Cry 4 in terms of playability.\n\nAll in all, a great game bogged down by poor redesign and an incomplete transition to modern PCs. If you don't have the patience for mods - and unless someone has the kindness and time to put together everything into one, easy-to-handle package - you're better off with the console versions.","June 5, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is still one of my favorite action games to date, and the gameplay is still challenging.  However, you will have to do some work if you want it to work.\n\nIt's made even more dynamic with the ability to expand on Virgil and switch styles on the fly (using mods).\n\nFor those who have never played a Devil May Cry title, this is arguably the best of them all.  Though there's options to start on Easy, the game can become extremely challenging.  Once you clear one difficulty, the next one is unlocked.  The hardest difficulty gets extremely hard with more enemies in each level, faster enemies that deal more damage, bosses with fatal (or near) attacks, and if you don't clear enemies quickly, the become much harder to kill.\n\nI think this is one of Capcom's best titles, even though the voice-acting and cutscenes are corny.

Well look no further, this game offers both of these things. Even on Normal mode.\n\nIt's ridiculous on how hard this game. So combat wise it's a pretty fun game but it has some problems.\n\nThe weapons have few moveset in the start and buying upgrades for them on the first run is pretty hard. Grinding souls just isn't an option on Normal mode either in my opinion. So it's best to stick with a weapon and that would most likely be Rebellion.\nFor the styles it's pretty much Swordmaster that you need. You can hit enemies in the air then because you'll always do a downward thrust. Later on you might use Doppleganger though because it can double your power on stunned bosses. Which is nice.\n\nFor items you need to be aware of one thing. The price goes up when you buy one. It goes up a lot. Using an item and continuing a stage makes you lose the item and start over the last checkpoint. Keep that in mind when fighting bosses.\n\n\nAs for getting the game to work. It ran fine on my system and my PS2 gamepad worked just fine with the game. But if you have a 360 gamepad you might need to look up on a fix.\n\nBut honestly, I'd pick up Devil May Cry 4 instead as the controls are better that time around.

There are very easy workarounds to get the resolution you want, and to fix the gamepad controls.\n\nI never really got a chance to play this game on the PS2, since it didn't seem like a game I would really be interested in, however after a few years of being released on PC, it caught my attention, most noticeably, it's really, really high rating, and I thought to myself, is this game really that good? Short answer: YES.\n\nBack in 2007 (with a 2004 Packard Bell PC) I was just glad I was running the game, I was new to PC gaming, so I didn't really have a clue what to expect. The visuals weren't really impressive, especially in 640x480 resolution, but I did manage to get it to full screen and a slightly higher res. The main problem was the keyboard controls, they were very unusual at first, and the game also was probably the hardest one I had played to date on PC (mind you, it was probably only the 10th game I played on PC) Just the second mission boss was owning me again and again, and probably went the same way about 10 more times before, I got fed up and stopped playing, and this was on normal difficulty.\n\nA few days later picked it up again and started playing, this time I somehow managed to scrape by the first boss, and off I went, one of the best games I have ever played, and also gave me the mentality to never give up on a hard game, it's always more satisfying when the game is hard, unlike DmC. DMC 3 truly is an epic game, with cheesy (but funny) one liners and whole load of awesome action, the cinematics are awesomely done, the storyline (though confusing at times) is awesome.\n\nIt really disappoints me that there hasn't been a true continuation of the DMC storyline, even in DMC 4, the main focus was not on Dante. But I am getting ahead of myself, and there are spoilers if I keep going on, and someone is still yet to play DMC 4, so I'll just stop here.\n\nNow that I have the game on steam, I had a few problems with the controls again, but this time for the gamepad, I was already used to the keyboard controls, since I played through this game before, and I also wanted to play it in 1080p this time, and with the help of the Steam community and a few mods, I got it to run as I wanted it to both the resolution and the gamepad, except for the quick weapon switches the triggers on the 360 controller are the only buttons that don't respond, it doesn't bother me much since my favourite weapons are the default ones anyway, Rebellion is just too good, and Ebony and Ivory are just the trademark guns you can't go anywhere without them. Besides that, the game looks better than ever, and I would definitely recommend you get this game, especially in a sale, since they didn't really do a good job on the port. Trust me the extra work will be completely worth your time, I wasn't into these kinds of games before, but this game just got me hooked to the DMC story.","December 24, 2014","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You acquire an arsenal of five melee and five long range weapons, each category of which you can equip two and seamlessly switch between them. This is hardly astonishing nowadays, but it still blends together magnificently. There is also the bloody palace, an arena mode that provides slaughter aplenty.\nThis version comes with new difficulty modes (compared to the original on PS2), which may or may not be of interest to you, and with a playable Vergil. This is a fun variant of the fighting gameplay, but does not introduce a lot of new content otherwise - the levels are simply the campaign all over again, minus the story cutscenes.\nOne thing that should be mentioned is the optimization of the steam version. I bought the game in retail originally, and there were quite a few problems with it not recognizing gamepads correctly or at all - I ended up with a JoyToKey-workaround, which rather nullified the use of analog sticks, and still had trouble mapping the controller because some buttons were not registered, some double, and some of the in-game controls refused to be changed. The steam game comes with a controller configuration application, a nice little thing that took all this work away and actually succeeded in using both sticks and the various seemingly problematic buttons. This little addition increases playability a good deal for me.\n\nIf you do not have this game yet and care for action / (sword-) fighting games with a really well thought-through combat system, I highly recommend looking into this.","December 18, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(I'd recommend XPadder if you really need the gamepad controls.)\nTheres also this weapon changing from the pause menu, why not during ingame for blazing the ♥♥♥♥ out of the combo'ing? (though this is possible in DMC4, but whatever.)\n\nRating: 7 / 10\n\nPros: Obvious gameplay is obvious, lots of weapons to use, a ♥♥♥♥ing guitar as a weapon (holy ♥♥♥♥),\nDevil Triggers are game changers to cause more mayhem.\n\nCons: Problems with gamepad, Weapon switching should've been ingame instead of in the pause menu.","January 28, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Not to mention, because of the keyboard, you can't fully use combos to their max potentional. Still, even though this game has alot of issues...

Evereyon who has played the original game on other systems will conclude about how much they enjoyed and loved this game and I have never played those other systems much.

While DMC4 is easier to get into, and more polished in both the gameplay and graphics department - it's no reason to overlook this game. DMC3 is arguably more difficult, and boasts a larger total weapon set along with what is in my opinion a much better setting and theme (very much Castlevania esque). In DMC3:SE you are also granted the ability to play as Dante's twin brother Vergil, who presents a very different and equally fun playstyle. There are also more total styles available for Dante, including Quicksilver (slow time) and Doppleganger (second Dante that repeats moves you do)\n\nFast paced combat filled with many combos and mechanics, along with a sizable amount of content and replayability, it makes for an overall fun experience that gets better as you do.\n\nMy only problem is the fact that the base port is very poorly done. KB&M controls are quite awful, and game performance has a tendency to drop even on a powerful rig for seemingly no reason (I mean, it's a PS2 era game on modern hardware).\n\nRegardless, highly recommended for fans of action and fighting games.

Devil May Cry is one of the less forgiving entries in the series, but does crappy port of the game does no justice. Some people will try to defend their purchase that it is rather playable, but you need to do some advance configurations to get the game running with playable settings.\n\nControl support is barebones to the point that you might as well play with mouse and keyboard, oh wait, that's broken too.\n\nGraphics are really choppy and the setttings are barebones as well.\n\nThe game aside is good but this port is horrendous.\n\nI got this game with a DMC 4 bundle so I don't really care that this is in my library, but if anyone were to buy this game seperate please, I beg of  you don't buy it, and buy DMC4 seperate as it is worth the money.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go buy the console version or the DMC HD collection, or emulate it, whatever. Its really upsetting that this game is still up for sale and Valve won't take it down because they want to have DMC games in their library. Trust me, you'll love yourself for buying the console version instead of this poor excuse of a port that hasn't been updated forever.\n\nEDIT: So I found out that there is a mod that does fix the support for controls and video settings.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/6550/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","Let me start this review by saying I didn't play this game anywhere near launch (started only recently), and have had very little experience with the Devil May Cry series before I started playing this game. I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.\n\nWith that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.\n\nFirst of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War).\nExploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.\nThe controls in the game however are problematic. While I've got them to work perfectly with my Logitech F310 (in D-Input mode) and Net Way PS3/PC Gamepad, This game doesn't support Xbox 360 and One controllers without some tweaking, so I recommend having an older, Direct-Input controller to play with as Keyboards aren't optimal for this type of game. 10/10 (with a gamepad, otherwise 6. yeah, it's that important)\n\nThe graphics of the game are showing their age; it is a relatively old game, and doesn't support high resolutions. Also, the graphics of this version are inferior to the PS2 and HD Collection versions as some of the more advanced lighting and shadowing effects are missing, and there is some very mild lag in some areas. The game is still perfectly fun and playable with these faults, but it's still something to keep in mind though if you care a lot about visuals. The character and environment designs however were pretty good for their time, and still have a bit of charm, even today. (7/10)\n\nThe music here is a mixed bag: I'm not a fan of the heavy-metal esque battle themes, although they fit the setting of the game. The rest of the music, like ambient sounds and effects are immersive however, and the goddess statue and final boss themes were very nice IMO. (6.5/10, although if you like the battle themes you might give an 8 or a 9)\n\nFinally replayability. This game isn't very long (about 12 hours for my first playthrough) but has immense replay value, with a lot of harder difficulty levels to unlock and test your skills with, an alternate playable character with unique weapons (Vergil), the ability to carry your upgrades and items from playthrough to playthrough, and the Bloody Palace, an arena with near endless battles, this game can keep you busy for a very long time if you want to master it. 10/10.\n\nVerdict: DMC3 SE is a fantastic game, with a ton of replay value. If you have a gamepad and don't mind a minor graphical downgrade, this is a solid reccomendation. If you're with a keyboard though or want the best graphics available, I'd recommend getting the PS2 version/HD remake if you can. Even if you can't, there's still a very solid game here. (No final score, as there are too many variables depending on your hardware and everyone has their own priorities in games. I only try to advise. Who am I to judge what you find important?)","December 11, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is no question about that. However, with some tweaking you can get this game in playable form. There is a mod for the game called, the "Style Switcher" that enhances the game greatly with HD richness. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to get this mod to work and it's a long process of steps. The good news is that I was able to get the xbox controller working and the game playable at full screen without implementing the "Style Switcher" mod. Sadly, I'm missing out on HD enhancements. Instead DMC3 is displayed more in tune with it's PS2 counterpart. That means some jaggies even at a higher resolution. Still, the game is totally playable you just have to make a few edits, which are all explained in the DMC3 community guides section here on Steam.\n\nI played the original on PS2 and skipped out on DMC2 because I read lackruster things about it. DMC3 is a prequel to the original so really nothing is missed. DMC3 is a stylish-high action-combo masher- adventure title. It's a huge step up from the original (which was very enjoyable) and perhaps from DMC 2 (so I've heard).\n\nDespite negative reviews here on Steam I'm going to go ahead and recommend the steam version of DMC3. I would highly suggest NOT purchasing it for $19.99 and wait for the game to go on sale. That's exactly what I did. Just be prepared to make some edits in the game's files, which is a very easy process. I wish I could say the same about the "Style Switcher" mod. That will require some patience and possibily some trials of errors.\n\nDMC3 is well praised from both critics and fans as being the best entry in the DMC series. Don't miss it as it's a great game just wait for a sale!","October 4, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As for the controls, seriously guys, as many people posting about how the XBox controller won't work there are still people who continue to say so. Rather than complaining, go out and get a Logitech controller, adjust the controls with the gamepad application in the main file, and you're set to go. It's like playing on your PS2 all over again. But aside from some graphical errors, the game is still as great as it was when it first came out. Using an emulator takes too much time, what with finding all the files you need or having to actually purchase the game CD from one of the few small town stores that sell old and retro games/consoles. In my opinion it is better to just buy it on here, and spend a little bit of money for a simple Logitech controller. Or if you're too lazy to edit controls or get a controller, find a store that sells old PS2 games and consoles. 10/10 Will CONTINUE to play.","June 21, 2014","true","17.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/6550/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","Let me start this review by saying I didn't play this game anywhere near launch (started only recently), and have had very little experience with the Devil May Cry series before I started playing this game. I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.\n\nWith that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.\n\nFirst of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War).\nExploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.\nThe controls in the game however are problematic. While I've got them to work perfectly with my Logitech F310 (in D-Input mode) and Net Way PS3/PC Gamepad, This game doesn't support Xbox 360 and One controllers without some tweaking, so I recommend having an older, Direct-Input controller to play with as Keyboards aren't optimal for this type of game. 10/10 (with a gamepad, otherwise 6. yeah, it's that important)\n\nThe graphics of the game are showing their age; it is a relatively old game, and doesn't support high resolutions. Also, the graphics of this version are inferior to the PS2 and HD Collection versions as some of the more advanced lighting and shadowing effects are missing, and there is some very mild lag in some areas. The game is still perfectly fun and playable with these faults, but it's still something to keep in mind though if you care a lot about visuals. The character and environment designs however were pretty good for their time, and still have a bit of charm, even today. (7/10)\n\nThe music here is a mixed bag: I'm not a fan of the heavy-metal esque battle themes, although they fit the setting of the game. The rest of the music, like ambient sounds and effects are immersive however, and the goddess statue and final boss themes were very nice IMO. (6.5/10, although if you like the battle themes you might give an 8 or a 9)\n\nFinally replayability. This game isn't very long (about 12 hours for my first playthrough) but has immense replay value, with a lot of harder difficulty levels to unlock and test your skills with, an alternate playable character with unique weapons (Vergil), the ability to carry your upgrades and items from playthrough to playthrough, and the Bloody Palace, an arena with near endless battles, this game can keep you busy for a very long time if you want to master it. 10/10.\n\nVerdict: DMC3 SE is a fantastic game, with a ton of replay value. If you have a gamepad and don't mind a minor graphical downgrade, this is a solid reccomendation. If you're with a keyboard though or want the best graphics available, I'd recommend getting the PS2 version/HD remake if you can. Even if you can't, there's still a very solid game here. (No final score, as there are too many variables depending on your hardware and everyone has their own priorities in games. I only try to advise. Who am I to judge what you find important?)","December 11, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hammy, trite dialogue, a plot that is skin deep and a protagonist that is a grade A ♥♥♥♥♥♥-bag... it's definitely not your regular AAA game. Still it has it's charm, and despite a couple of really terribly designed bosses, is a good but fair challenge. It has high action, hack and slash elements with a nice levelling and point system that keeps you coming back for more.\n\nThe PC port is terrible, a true travesty. However, follow the guides an this can be running in 1920 x 1080, with an xbox controller without a hitch. It's a shame that the community is left to fixed this travesty, but when it's on a good deal I would still recommend purchasing it for nostalgia or a good Sunday afternoon fun.\n\nBack to the game, several professional reviews said the game world was massive... Don't be fooled, after about midway most of the game is just level revisits with something slightly altered.

It's outrageous, over the top, absolutely full of itself and impressively challenging - everything you need to make an action game spectacle. Even the story to this day is somehow still pretty solid all around - a rarity in the genre, even if it is delivered with all the gusto of an anime with an overblown budget.\n\nThat the game doesn't work "out of the box" should be enough for me to tear it down in a review, as this prevents the vast majority of people out there from experiencing it. If you have a console in which you can get the HD Collection it is the better alternative.\n\n-BUT-\n\nVia the wonders of modding, the game is rendered perfectly playable. Using the Style Switcher mod not only stabilizes the game and allows it to function properly (and configure to a 360 controller correctly) but it also grants 1080p display resolution and introduces DMC 4-esque style-switching on the fly - something the original DMC 3 didn't have. Though not a part of the original design, on a fourth playthrough it is a godsend and arguably improves an already wonderful title. Capcom may be garbage at porting games over to PC, but I could care less at this point. The game is good, and a simpe install makes it work. Buy or don't buy, that's the end of the discussion right there.\n\nIf you do get it, however, I advise you to get ready for one of the craziest parties you're ever going to attend.

Devil May Cry is one of the less forgiving entries in the series, but does crappy port of the game does no justice. Some people will try to defend their purchase that it is rather playable, but you need to do some advance configurations to get the game running with playable settings.\n\nControl support is barebones to the point that you might as well play with mouse and keyboard, oh wait, that's broken too.\n\nGraphics are really choppy and the setttings are barebones as well.\n\nThe game aside is good but this port is horrendous.\n\nI got this game with a DMC 4 bundle so I don't really care that this is in my library, but if anyone were to buy this game seperate please, I beg of  you don't buy it, and buy DMC4 seperate as it is worth the money.\n\nDo yourself a favor and go buy the console version or the DMC HD collection, or emulate it, whatever. Its really upsetting that this game is still up for sale and Valve won't take it down because they want to have DMC games in their library. Trust me, you'll love yourself for buying the console version instead of this poor excuse of a port that hasn't been updated forever.\n\nEDIT: So I found out that there is a mod that does fix the support for controls and video settings. BUT my review still stands as a thumbs down as no one should buy this game full price just for a third party mod. Just get the console version with the HD Collection.","February 3","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/recommended/6550/","lightbringerid","Lightbringer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lightbringerid/","83 products in account","Let me start this review by saying I didn't play this game anywhere near launch (started only recently), and have had very little experience with the Devil May Cry series before I started playing this game. I did have experience playing God of War, Ninja Gaiden Sigma and the like before however, so I'm familiar with the Hack & Slash genre.\n\nWith that said, here is my review. You're free to disagree with my points (I'd be more glad if you did agree though :)) as this is my personal opinion.\n\nFirst of all, the story. I kinda liked it, although it wasn't unusually gripping or emotional.  I don't want to spoil anything to people who haven't played it yet, but I will say that thanks to Dante's entertaining persona, the memorable bosses, and a few nice plot twists I didn't expect, it's one of the better plots for this type of game I came across. 7/10\n\nThe gameplay. This game has the best combat I've ever seen in this type of game, with great flow, especially on Turbo mode. Trying out different load-outs (there are plenty of combinations of arms, and most weapons are unique and fun to use) and styles (essentially a selectable special move to go along with your weapons) is addicting, and enemies (bosses in particular) are varied and require different strategies rather than repetitive mashing or QTEs to beat (looking at you, God of War).\nExploration and puzzles were a bit too simplistic for me most of the time, but helped make this game feel more like a grand adventure than a static arena.\nThe controls in the game however are problematic. While I've got them to work perfectly with my Logitech F310 (in D-Input mode) and Net Way PS3/PC Gamepad, This game doesn't support Xbox 360 and One controllers without some tweaking, so I recommend having an older, Direct-Input controller to play with as Keyboards aren't optimal for this type of game. 10/10 (with a gamepad, otherwise 6. yeah, it's that important)\n\nThe graphics of the game are showing their age; it is a relatively old game, and doesn't support high resolutions. Also, the graphics of this version are inferior to the PS2 and HD Collection versions as some of the more advanced lighting and shadowing effects are missing, and there is some very mild lag in some areas. The game is still perfectly fun and playable with these faults, but it's still something to keep in mind though if you care a lot about visuals. The character and environment designs however were pretty good for their time, and still have a bit of charm, even today. (7/10)\n\nThe music here is a mixed bag: I'm not a fan of the heavy-metal esque battle themes, although they fit the setting of the game. The rest of the music, like ambient sounds and effects are immersive however, and the goddess statue and final boss themes were very nice IMO. (6.5/10, although if you like the battle themes you might give an 8 or a 9)\n\nFinally replayability. This game isn't very long (about 12 hours for my first playthrough) but has immense replay value, with a lot of harder difficulty levels to unlock and test your skills with, an alternate playable character with unique weapons (Vergil), the ability to carry your upgrades and items from playthrough to playthrough, and the Bloody Palace, an arena with near endless battles, this game can keep you busy for a very long time if you want to master it. 10/10.\n\nVerdict: DMC3 SE is a fantastic game, with a ton of replay value. If you have a gamepad and don't mind a minor graphical downgrade, this is a solid reccomendation. If you're with a keyboard though or want the best graphics available, I'd recommend getting the PS2 version/HD remake if you can. Even if you can't, there's still a very solid game here. (No final score, as there are too many variables depending on your hardware and everyone has their own priorities in games. I only try to advise. Who am I to judge what you find important?)","December 11, 2015","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However there are major porting issues which render the game unplayble via a control pad if your not prepared to download the software to fix them (there are guides on the web and links through other reviews). You can get it to work close to full screen with alt + enter and once you have a controller software set up the game seems to run ok apart from the  camera. This is because the developers current config software maps both the camera and movement to the right analog stick on  PC controllers.\n\nAs it stands it is only worth buying as a sale item and I would love to see a fix released on the controls.\n\nThis game would also benefit from the steam workshop (if someone would release the modding facility for the game)","September 15, 2014","false","23.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
