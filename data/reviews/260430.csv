I rarely write these anyway, but I find this game to be particularly interesting to discuss.\n\nFirst of all, it is a great idea, and fun to play.\n\nThat said, BlackJack, particularly, became utterly unplayable a few days prior to the writing of this review. Tables could not be joined; people had to leave chips on the table; dealers just disappeared into thin air.\n\nNormally, I would chalk it up to some bugs, but there is a principle of great importance here:\n\nIf you put your chips on that table, and that table stops working, I don't care if it is 1 cent or 1 billion of them, you should not lose that money because the game fails.\n\nI am incredibly frustrated by the fact that the game came out of alpha, and this is the result. They can NOT charge money for a broken game in this regard. Every casino game needs to be very secure and stable before they begin asking for our cents.\n\nThe game will charge a Steam account for the purchase of chips. How can they charge for the purchase of chips when you are forced by fault of the game to leave chips on the table when it locks up?\n\nI love the concept. I am irritated beyond belief (as are most players in the place lately) with the bugged out, game crushing, problems.\n\nSummary: I wouldn't advise placing a bet until I've interrogated everyone in the room to be sure things are working right at the time you are considering joining a game.\n","June 6, 2015","false","57.2"," 157 of 188 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","157","188","13","9"

For that I warn folks who have issues to be careful speaking up. Seems this Dev likes their dirty tricks when they don't want their filthy laundry aired out.\n\n\nThis is my final review edit. After enough time with four kings, I have decided they have completely lost touch with the fanbase who supported them from day one. Just as they did on playstion home for six long years.\n\nIm going to be honest here, I'm not liking the way things are going. I thought after they had their time with playstation home, we'd see changes that showed they learned their lesson last time from customer feedback.\n\nI remember a time when DL had a casino on ps home, it was an avitar social world with literally hundreds of mini games and places to chat and play. Game themed rooms and more. They also had a casino there and they did the same thing with chips there. The games there were PLAUGED with bugs and cheaters, very little was done. However they had no issue releasing an apartment for over 50 dollars that came with the same games you already had access to in their casino and they REFUSED to change the pricing even with such negative feedback. Oh and might I add, the people who were stupid enough to buy it lost those items anyway when ps home closed it's doors this past march.\n\nPeople lost thousands of chips with no rembursement, and the tournaments were a joke. You had to pay 4.99 for a tournament bracelet with no guarantee of any reward. Just a pat on the back for those who didnt make the cut, while they pocketed their real money.\n\n\nI was much happier with this game during EA. Now? Theyre making the game completely un fun by catering to the new players they want to spend money. Bingo nerfs are beyond terrible.\n\nIm now seated at a progressive game with over 25 players. The pot would usually be over 100k. It isn't even breaking 40k right now...and rp payouts are the same as the main floor games.\n\nThe people who bought in during early access are being pushed away to cater to the casual player with a spending problem.\n\nI have taken a break from four kings and returned today to see if the nerfs were truly as bad as they say, I'm unhappy to report they are far worse than what players are complaining about. I remember sitting at bingo for hours, and not having this back of luck either. One could say it comes and it goes, but this is just ridiculous.\n\nI was quick to respond to a gent who made a post on how this game is not only exploiting potential gambling addicts, but nothing more than a cash grab. I really would like to recall that person's username, so I can apologize and say they might be right.\n\nBecause the players who bought into this game and made is possible for it to even make it out of early access are being disregarded. If this is what developers plan to do to people who buy into their games in order to support a title, I am swearing off EA games entirely. Because this seems to be a NASTY habit with devs on here. They bend over backwards during EA, but after they get your money all bets are off.","June 19, 2015","false","300.3"," 164 of 202 people (81%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","81","164","202","13","8"

Especially after I started the game, entered my info and was expected to get a confirmation email that I had to use to verify myself. I never got it. So I tried logging into the casino anyway, and got in!\n\nSo I created my avatar, got my initial set of quests, which involved going into the various parts of the casino to get free coins, which I did to humor the developers attempt at a psuedo-tutorial. Got my money and proceeded to try out the various casino games.\n\nThe slot games were pretty good. I won reasonably enough but it was still a slow bleed of coins. Which I actually liked. It wasn't like Facebook slots where you lose everything in an hour, nor was it so generous that they were practically just free ATM machines.\n\nYou won enough to keep playing, even some nice big wins and bonus games, and yet lost enough to keep it real.\n\nI then went to play some bingo. The buy-in was a bit pricey, but it was well designed and fun to play as well. Being a semi-senior citizen myself I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was at a good reasonable pace that I could keep up with four cards yet at a good enough pace to keep you daubing those numbers.\n\nEven though they have multi-player blackjack and poker rooms, I played some video poker and blackjack to get the feel of things there.\n\nThe video blackjack was novel in that you played all 5 player slots against the dealer, and it was quite fun doing it that way. This was the ony time that I actually felt that the game was actually working against the players in that in playing around 30 hands the dealer never busted once, even when its face card was a 5 or 6, but I still won enough to play a good amount of time without feeling too cheated since I was playing 5 hands to its 1.\n\nNext I went to the video poker Jacks or Better machine which I personally felt was the one type of game where you can truly see how stacked the games are against players....and I was shocked....\n\nI don't even like video poker, but I ended up playing it for the next two hours. The odds were truly nearly perfect. I was even able to make a few inside straights, a handful of flushes on two card draws, and even keeping pairs of low cards was a reasonable and winnable strategy.\n\nIt was a thing of beauty. An honest, true to the odds video poker game. When I looked up and it was after midnight on a work night and I had played two hours on a casino game that I truly hated I was sold.\n\nThis is a good attempt at casino games, where their offerings are, at this point and time, honest and true to the odds, and actually pretty darn fun to play. I was truly shocked.\n\nThe real money shop is very reasonably priced, even better than Facebook casino's and its very liberal about giving you free coins as you play.\n\nAll in all I had a good time and was truly shocked that I did, and that I want to play again and try out other games. And I want to play more video poker...which I can't believe I'm actually saying....\n\nSo yeah...Four Kings Casino is truly in a world of its own compared to other casino-type games out there, and if you're in the least bit interested in it then it's definitely worth downloading and checking out for yourself.","July 28, 2015","true","10.2"," 77 of 101 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","77","101","7","0"

Unlike other Free Casino/Poker games, this one doesn't press you for real-world cash to actually play the game. Which instantly impressed me. You're able to spend your initial starting cash however you please, with a variety of different casino games on offer, all with reasonable in-game costs and payouts.\n\nIt has a generous system of earnings, giving you free credits every 15 minutes and an objectives system that allows you to earn extra in-game cash for completing various tasks in the games and around the virtual casino.\n\nWith all this in mind, and the overall quality of the game-world, balance and mechanics. For a FREE game, I'm incredibly impressed with it. It has the addicting nature of online gambing without the home-destroying nature of online gambling... unless you stop going to work because you sink all of your time into this game, but still thoroughly enjoyable if you're into casino games but don't want to spend your real world money on anything other than a sense of fashion for your casino avatar, I'd highly suggest giving this a go.","August 9, 2015","true","12.4"," 32 of 38 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","32","38","0","0"

This is an MMORPG that happens to be set in a casino.  LIke regular casino slot games, it is expected that you will lose your chips, and be expected to buy more.\n\nThe Devs have created a nice variety of games, and are working to add more.  However, the major draw for this game is the player interaction.\n\nNow, like any MMORPG, you're going to have your bad apples, the players who just want to cause trouble.  But, on the whole, the players are a good group, and it is fun to interact with people from around the world.\n\nYou also have the fun of creating your avatar, and buying various clothing options.  There are items available for real money, and also items available for RP - the reward points you earn when you win in the casino.\n\nJust don't expect the game to be something it's not, and expect to spend money on chips if you play a lot, and enjoy the aspects of the game that are truly exceptional.

You can walk around, talk to other players, and lose all of your chips in a single hand of blackjack because you decided to hit on 17. It's good at what it does, and it's a shame that there aren't more games on Steam like this. WIth that out of the way, there are in fact, microtransactions, bugs, and space issues. All of these issues though, are not nearly as bad as people make them out to be. You never HAVE to buy chips in order to play. You are generously given chips frequently. Every 15 minutes you get 250. Logging in for the first time grants you 1000, and 500 for each subsequent day you log in. And finally, doing daily and weekly tasks, gives you chips. Trust me, you should have plenty of enough chips to start playing anything except for maybe Poker.\nAs for bugs, I personally have only encountered one. It's slightly annoying to join a table, only to freeze and be unable to do anything. That being said, that was literally only the first day of me playing. I haven't had that problem at all since.\nPeople complaining about "Dealers dealing to nonexistent people" are probably just having internet troubles. Now, the only REAL issue, is the lack of tables. There's tons of slot machines and plenty of seats in Bingo, but there's a huge issue with Blackjack and Poker tables being full constantly.\n\nI fully recommend this game for people that don't want to spend money on actually going to the Casino. It's a casual casino experience, and it's great at being that.","June 4, 2015","true","14.2"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","34","49","3","0"

So with that being said, ill give you all a Pros/Cons list.\n\nPROS\n1- *AMAZING COMMUNITY* - the devs are vocal with the community and are actually in game talking with players, I had a great conversation with one not long before posting this, which made me decide to actually post this review. This alone should be enough for you to at least check out this community.\n\n2- Assortment of games - Games from Video Poker, blackjack, Keno, Slots and various table games.  Pretty much you'll find the most common table games\n\n3- Atmosphere - The piano music playing casually in the background while playing Baccarat. Or when you walk by the bar and see some players having a casual chat about their luck. This game completely nails the feeling if being inside a casino.\n\n\nCons - honestly not really things which ruin the game or make it bad, just small quality of life things which can honestly be patched in over time. *shortly before this posting the bingo room had a patch already fixing one of my biggest gripes*\n\n\n1- Running animation - good lord the run cycle on player models.... I just feel they need to be redone completely.\n\n\nThere's some various tiny things with the player model and items, but its so minor I don't feel the need to bring it up.\n\n\n\nOverall feeling about the game??

If  like me you were looking for a fun  way to pretend to  gamble then  do not buy this game because once out of Early Access it could end up costing you a lot of money if you continue to play the game.  During Early Access you can earn small amounts of chips  (usually  25 chips at a time) for doing   several things like visiting certain area's of the casino, plus you can earn the same number of  chips  for every 15 minutes you spend in game.  When you  enter the Casino after purchasing the game you  are given 1000 chips.\n\nMy first love is  slots, so  I casually ran over to the slots and   after 10 spins  I'd spent  virtually all of my chips.   Thankfully, during the  Early Acess phase you can get more chips for   very little money; i.e.  there are several selections ranging from 500 chips to 40 000 chips each one of which  costs you $0.01 to purchase. This amount is deducted from your Steam wallet.   Once early access is over these will undoubtably change and cost much more.  Sadly, like any gambling den, the odds are always stacked against you.\n\nAfter the 10 turns on the  slots, with virtually no chips left  and not wanting to wait around for  almost an hour before I could get  a couple  more spins, I left, then rejoined the following day because I was under the impression that during Early Access we would be given   1000 chips every  day, but this was not the case (I purchased the  basic game plus the cheaper of the dlc's, (costing me a total of just over £16).\n\nI don't know whether   you can or will be able to convert  any winnings  to  real money, but even if you were, it's only a  lucky few that would ever manage to get any real money back.\n\nPersonally I'm really disappointed with this game.  I was  hoping to be able to play a wide range of different slot machines,  but there was little  variety to be found, plus until I decided to buy the  highest  slection of chips I only had enough for two spins and  four goes on the roulette table (which has a minimum bet of 10 chips).\n\nPart way through my second visit there was a server reboot.  I was given literally a  minute's warning in which I was asked to log off.  As I was part way through a gamble  when this occured I wasn't    pleased.\n\nDespite it being in Early Access, so by definition  not a completed game, I can't recommend this game to anyone but   hardened gamblers.","February 19, 2015","false","3.8"," 41 of 69 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","41","69","2","11"

Slots is the easiest game to sink money and time into and the current machine is rather lackluster. I'm aware a new machine is on it's way and that's what I'm most excited for.\n\nThere is some issues with the games UI still and quite a few issues regarding the VIP system and everything relating that is rather confusing and not very well explained.\n\nThe customisation of the characters is very strong and enjoyable, there is a lot of options regarding your style and the currency to buy items is a little hard to get however it's very rewarding when you finally get the item you have wanted.\n\n\nMy biggest gripe is the VIP system and that is runs on a server based clock and if you manage to get VIP one day before the end of the month you get it for only that one day, then when the reset rolls around it clocks you back to normal status.\nEven if you purchased one of the dlc packs for a month of VIP it resets you to normal status when the monthly reset happens - so if you purchase it at a bad time you could only get 5 days of VIP or however long untill the month changes.\n\nThis is a game I have been waiting for, and for a very long time. I am so glad it has finally come and it is so enjoyable. The updates are frequent however often not many new features as there is a lot of work to be done on the backend of the game and the new games etc take a very long time to produce.\nThe payouts are balance, the game is fun, and the servers are fast.\n\nA great game in my opinion and I'm glad I bought into the beta before it went F2P because I got so much out of it.

I spoke with one of the developers today and I can truly say they are putting in their best efforts to improve this game. An update is being installed as I type. I entered the casino and I must say, everything is quite self-explanatory. After playing a few spins on the roulette table I ran into a member of the dev-team and had a nice conversation. I have been looking for a game like this for AAAGES. But two weeks ago I searched yet again for a decent casino game on steam, and only a bit later, this comes out. It is truly amazing and heading in the good direction.\n\nYes, there may be bugs and things may not be as "smooth" as one would like, but keep in mind that this game is still in development. I bought the all-in package and I am glad I did. I wonder if it will be ever possible to turn your 'earnings' into real money, since you can buy additional chips in the game with real currency. Anyway this game is really a must-have if you love gambling. This is the first time I have ever written a decent review on a steam game. On a game in general, I think. But let me tell you once again: It. Is. Worth. It. The variety of games to play is good. There's blackjack, single-deck 21, craps, keno, hold 'em poker, roulette, PuntoBanco/Baccarat, slot machines and some kind of "Wheel of fortune". There is also a VIP-area which allows you to play at tables with higher stakes, which makes it possible to either win more - or loose more - being able to change your bet more to your liking. You can also sit on a bench and do some emotes while talking, this adds to the real-life atmosphere.\n\nI will keep a close eye on the development of this game!\n\n>went to blackjack table\n> bet $1.000\n>Double down at 16\n>5\n>21\n\n10/10 would double down again on high numbers.","February 24, 2015","true","76.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","2"

On the bright side, there are plenty of ways to earn free chips (daily quests, spinning a daily wheel, visiting the chip machine every so often, etc.).  There was barely anyone on when I played, though the gentleman I ran into was nice enough...hopefully the folks who will potentially populate the server will be equally as warm.

If you're familiar with the PS3 Home casino, or even if you're not, you'll love this game.\n\nI took a risk buying this, as I don't usually expect much from early access, but this really surprised me. From the couple of hours of playing this, I've experienced stable, smooth, solid gameplay. I've tried all games in the casino, and they all work without a single hitch. If it didn't even say it was early access, I wouldn't have even known that it was.\n\nGood points:\n- Has a nice atmosphere, really feels like a nice place to hang out\n- Gameplay is smooth\n- Control/movement is great\n- Blackjack\n- The community who play regularly are really nice\n\nImprovement suggestions:\n- Avatar customisation is lacking\n- Lack of people to talk to (will improve with popularity hopefully!)\n- Lack of people to play Poker with\n- Chat/messaging system is a slightly buggy\n\nIf you're looking for a great casino game, this is the one. You can have a great casino experience for a few dollars. It's definitely worth buying now and investing for the future - I see great things ahead!

This puts the house edge of blackjack at over 10%, which in no variation of game rules is reasonable. Sitting at any table game will cause nothing but frustration for you, or the players beside you. It's no surprise that the only game played by the regulars is poker, which is played against other players, not the house.\n\nIf you choose to play this game, play it for the social experience, not for the excitement that a fair casino offers. There will not be enough enjoyment to justify the time, energy, and money you dump into the game.\n\nWhile I have enough chips in my account to bleed out for the next six months, I have instead decided to uninstall this game in favor of more fruitful pursuits.\n\nSocial experience: 9/10\nGambling experience 2/10","April 14","false","124.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

The navigation takes a bit of getting use to and clicking (E) to interact with tables and the video machines is cumbersome but still enjoy it nonetheless a very beautiful casino.

So from myself to the developers major props to you. in conclusion if you are a fan of card games or just the casino in general this game is a must have","March 5, 2015","true","141.2"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

About 2 years or more to be more exact.  So, back then, and even earlier, there was this thing called Playstation Home, and it was a place where you could play games, watch videos on new game/movie releases, meet people, socialize, and do other things as well.  It was an amazing place and the best part was just how you could be what you wanted to be, although some times it did have a price tag on it, and have fun.  One of the many companies I remembered was DL.   They were well known for having their Casino hub, and a lot of people liked them for it.   Now, back then, I was able to play as well, and although I spent more money than I would like to admit, I did have fun and once you got to a certain tier/level, you never had to worry about losing too much money because you just had to play smart and not be an idiot.\n\n\nWell that was nice and all but PSH was shutdown because Sony wasn't making enough money or something and all that money we spent, went bye bye.   Now, back to the present.  We have this Casino game, back up and free to play, and it has the same feel as the other casino did.   So my review is biased slightly because I really loved it back then and am happy to see it now.   Due to that, I will keep the review part, short and brief.\n\n\nPros:\nHas many different gambling games and slots\nNice way to customize your avatar in terms fo looks\nrewards for winning things or achieving things\nways to earn free chips so you can still play\nMuch much cheaper prices for chips than when it was on PSH\nVisuals are pretty but\nCon:\n\nVisuals are pretty, but if you put on max or near max, then you will lag, badly.  Its just not that well optimzied but who cares, its all about the gambling, not the visuals\nEasy to lose money fast if you don't know what you are doing\n\n\nOverall, this is very much like how Home was but with a few changes that make it nice.   And yes you can still dance in front of people and be a weirdo.","June 7, 2015","true","1.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","2"

Most typical casino games are present and the play style is that of an mmo with customizable avatars ect allowing you to navigate the realistic virtual casino setting and join the different games as you choose. Gameplay is very similar to the Digital Leisure casino that was part of playstation home, for those that played that, only graphically better. Bugs have been minimal over the several hours I've played so far and the game is pretty polished for the first few days of early access beta. I would definitely recommend this game for casual players who enjoy both casino style gaming and social mmo type game mechanics. My only caveat is that this game is not strictly a free to play game, but after its offical launch will be a microtransaction model wherein you have the option of  purchasing additional casino chips to augment or replenish your current holdings. As with any game of this nature the inherent cost will depend on what you decide to spend, so amongst those gamers who inexplicably expect to enjoy playing polished multiplayer games without having to financially support them I'm sure there will be complaining.","February 20, 2015","true","152.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJCaseyD/recommended/260430/","DJCaseyD","DJCaseyD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DJCaseyD/","582 products in account","I really wanted to like this game. I'm a big fan of casino games in general. I don't gamble much in real life, but it's nice to be able to have fun with little expense. Unfortunately, this game didn't really fit the bill.  From a social aspect, it's fine. Most of the people are nice. The rest of the game though, is severely lacking.\n\nPoker has the same problem it has anywhere else. It's free. People still make boneheaded calls and go all-in with nothing.  The bigger problem is that the only tournament you can play is with 6 people at one table. You start with $50k which would be fine if the blinds didn't go up extremely fast. It makes trying to play a realistic game of poker virtually impossible, as very soon after starting you're pretty much pot committed once you bet anything.\n\nBlackjack is probably the best part of the game though, especially after the last update, it literally feels like the dealer is getting 20 or 21 every other hand. Still, there is money to be made if you know how to play.\n\nThat brings me to the worst part of the game, table machines. Slots, keno, video blackjack and video poker are money suckers with what seems like much lower payout percentages than even Vegas. I literally sat there for 30-45 minutes without a single bonus round. Forget trying to bet anything higher than the minimum because you will soon be out of money.  There are only three types of slot machines which gets old really fast especially when none of them pay.  Keno has a minimum bet of $100 and video blackjack has a minimum of $200. With poor payouts, again you will be out of money quickly.  The game also has war, roulette, big wheel, craps and bingo which are all pretty standard.  Again, especially with war, it seems like the more money bet, the lower percentage of times you're going to win.\n\nYou have daily tasks to do, receiving $200 for each of the 6. Unfortunately, most of the time you will be spending more than that to complete the tasks. There are weekly tasks, mostly revolving around getting a certain amount of XP. An example of the problem with this is me spending 45 minutes playing a $400 per spin slot machine, losing 40k and gaining a whopping 200xp. That would have been great if the weekly task wasn't 1,000 XP with a few thousand reward for doing so.  There is a VIP section for high rollers but I honestly don't know how people get to be high rollers unless they have spent real money or gotten extremely lucky.\n\nAgain, I really wanted to like the game. Unforunately, there is better poker to be had on any online site and the rest of the game is just no fun with the extremely low payouts.  If you're just in it for the social aspect and don't mind betting small, go for it. Otherwise, I'd stick with other products.","September 5, 2015","false","39.3"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","14","24","0","6"

I like the idea and I think the developers' execution is well done. Using a laptop with HD3000 chip, I cannot rate the graphics.\n\nPlus:\n- The diversity of casino games is very good and even better than the average casino-only games.\n- The socializing is eased as a HUD is implemented similar to MMORPGs with some default mimics (Dance, Say Hello, Wave the hand, ...).\n- Easy start with start chips and the support through chip income with daily quests. If you do not want to spend hours on gambling, than I think it should be enough.\n\nNeutral:\n- The execution time of the casino table games is poor. It is onlz neutral, as the developer have to ensure that all players are on the same level all the times. But in a real live casino, the execution is mind blowing contrary to this game.\n- The party room seems unecessary, as there is never one in it. On first sight, this room also does not provide any benefit or interesting spot.\n- 3 Minutes to wait when all players are there to start a round of Bingo? That's far too high!\n\nMinus:\nBasically the casino consists of 5 rooms (hopefully I counted correctly). However, each room is only accessible via a loading screen. I think this concept is too much outdated to give here any possibilty for an excuse. The casino is not the Venetian and I think the level should be loadable within one go.","August 31, 2015","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

You should have no problem being able to gamble and hang with friends without buying chips if you know how to play the games.  Also if you don't over bet based on the amount of chips you have.

The game has events on the weekends (same 4 that repeat), daily tasks (quests if you will), and weekly tasks.  The leaderboards reset every 3 months (considered seasons) and I believe there are rewards at the end of each season depending on where you rank in each game and global.\n\nOn the downside, there are gliches which is to be expected.  They patch probably once a month, sometimes twice.  There are people that shouldn't be on the game much less within the social/online community like anywhere. Easily can be blocked though.\n\nIf you enjoy messing around with gambling then you would probably enjoy this game.","February 20","true","340.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I enjoy the real casino vibe it carries.  Almost all of the social aspects of the game fall totally flat.  Like your complimentary apartment, and the dance club.  There are zero reasons to go there.  I walked around the apartment and you can't do anything except sit on things.  I didn't even notice any customizable aspects to it.\n\nPros.\n\nReal Casino simulator in how you walk around and play the games.  Seems like most of the games simulate real life fairly well based on my experience with those games.  Poker is always agaisnt players so it is the "fairest", although it falls victim to all fake money poker games out there.\n\nCons.\n\nBlackjack.  Holy crap... the blackjack.\n\nThis game however is totally broken.  The dealer draws to 20 and 21 an INSANE amount of times.  It regularly draws to 20 and 21 with 5 and 6 showing.  The worst cards it can get.  The dealer also ends up with 20+ so often that you simply can't win even a 30 minute sitdown of basic BJ play.  I have played basic BJ rules, and in real life you can expect losing streaks of up to around 6 hands in a row.  More then that gets mathmatically inplausable, although 7 or even 8 could technically happen if you played for long periods of time.  This game however has gone on multiple 10+ hand losing streaks.  I have seen three 10 hand losing streaks in the last 2 days alone and Iv only dared play it a handful of times.  These happen in less then 20 minutes of playing.  The odds of this happening should be impossible, but it happens regularly.  10 unwinnable hands in a row when you play basic BJ.   I always play solo at the table to exclude any player errors.  Do NOT play BJ in this game.  Unless you are only going to play 3 or 4 hands and pray for a win.  But for real long term tight play, its useless.","August 19, 2015","true","19.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

So far I have had the game for only 2 DAYS, 2 DAYS!!!!!!............and i have lost over 20000 chips from glitches. I foolishly decided to purchase some more chips with real money just to enjoy another game of poker, but OF COURSE the table froze and everyone lost 5000 chips, all 6 players. I see the game has only been released since june the 1st, but yeah, the game devs are definitely going to want this fixed like yesterday or this game will be useless.\n\nNow, let me say this. These table glitch / freeze are the only issue i have with the game, other then that, the game is great. I'm forced to leave a negative review because of these very frequent very frustrating crashes that steal my chips, WHEN I WAS WINNING THE POKER Game. This turns a very fun game into a frustrating anger fueler. lol, seriously tho, fix the f-ing game.\n","June 12, 2015","true","216.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

It is in early access, but it's currently a great game in and of itself. Personally, I have really enjoyed the video poker and blackjack. Bingo and poker are relatively high-stakes (compared to the funds that I have in-game at the moment), but it seems like I will be able to play both games soon after accumulating more chips.\nOne thing though- I can't find any baccarat tables. It says in the game description that you can play baccarat, so they have either not incorporated it into the game as of yet, or it is in the VIP Lounge, which I cannot enter right now.\n\nAnother excellent feature is that even though you may have been "gambling" for hours, your character never loses his confident stride.\n\n10/10 would frolick in casinos again","July 1, 2015","true","67.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

F2P with chips and vanity items for sale with real money. Free 250 chips every 15 minutes. Mediocre customization compared to 80% of games on the market. The deciding factor for me was that although I get 250 chips every 15 minutes, buy-ins and minimum bets are much too high. 50 chips for a hand of war, 5000 chips for a sit and go 6 man poker game (besides the once-a-day freebie poker table), 200 per hand of video poker? I also couldn't find the payout table for the slot machine but that might just be a PEBKAC error. They really need to add about 3 floors to their casino with different stake levels on each floor. Currently not a recommendation but if they make the stakes lower so you can choose to play for fun and socializing instead of topping leaderboards I might change it.","June 3, 2015","false","4.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

A PS4 version is planned for the future. I must admit I was skeptical at first. Partly because I am not much of a gambler. But I wanted to be able to give our readers at yourpshome.net an insight as to what it was all about. Guess what? I got sucked in :)\n\nFirst of all, I was surprised at just how far this project has come along. I expected a very tiny begining and was amazed the first time I signed on that a whole casino was in front of me complete with a VIP room and a Club to party in. Now a nice "hotel room" (personal space) has been added which means the groundwork has been laid for future expansion.\n\nI orinally intended to just use the "free" or "beta" version, but it only took one visit to make me want to upgrade to an "All-In" pass. Well worth it.\n\nSo even if you are not a die-hard gambler, you might still want to check this out. This isn't a Home replacement but its the best I've seen so far. Check it out. Who knows what the future holds?","April 7, 2015","true","38.2"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

I bought and install this game yesterday but i didn't expect so much because this game is still in "early access" But when i'm enter the game, i'm very shocked. There are NO connection problem and NO major bugs. This game is only needs more slot machines, but i believe, developers will handle this. The developers are very polite and friendly, this is very good. Optimization is good, with my GT 710M graphics card, medium graphics option (Anti Aliasing is set "0" and Texture quality is "High"), FPS is between 40-60 (Fps dropped when i enter the crowd)\n\nWhen i went to Cyprus for holiday, i was play gambling in some casino's in Kyrenia and Nicosia. I love to slot machines and generally, i played slot machines in casino's. There are many but different slot machines in Cyprus's casinos. In real life, casino atmosphere is unlike anything. You can see different slot machines, poker and roulette tables, happy, sad, excited and angry people in casino. Anyway, i must admit that, this game have high potential, there is no doubt. I believe, developers will put many and good slot machines in this game.\n\nFriendly Advices:\n\n- More slot machines will be very nice\n- Adding croupier (dealer)\n- Adding waiter/waitress is maybe nice detail in this game. We can order drinks :)\n- Adding some events\n\nThat's all for now, thanks for this game :)\n\nEdit-1: Unlike many MMO's, almost all people in this game are very friendly and polite each other. Especially in the VIP Area, every people are very gentle. I admit that, i'm very glad in this situation.","April 28, 2015","true","277.6"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","1"

The dealer in Four Kings gets a 20+ more than half of the time after 30 hands and most of those are a starting pair of 10 value cards.\n\nThe chances of these things happening aren't impossible, but for my first example, you would literally be more likely to pick an atom in your house at random and then accidently pick it again. And this somehow happened 5 times, if that's not cheating then I must have a luck of about 1 or 2 because I have lost over 100k chips to the blackjack tables.","July 26, 2015","false","10.0"," 17 of 31 people (55%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","55","17","31","7","1"

The other games are fun (Blackjack being my fav!)  but the slots all 3 <--  -_-  of them need a lot of work there simly cheap looking crap they look nothing like the Vegas quality of flashy fun and the art on them is browser flash game quality at it's worst. The casino it's self isn't my style for a casino but it does the job, I would add the ablity to pick a theme for the casino set by the player like how a skin mod on L4D2 works only the player who picked it sees it that way you could theme more to your style. The clothing shops are lacking and the RP points are kinda silly sense a cash shop feature is in one of the most lacking shops already they should have it where you spend real money on the clothing outside of the free stuff you win of course. Overall i'd say that for a free game it's not bad but needs a lot of work to be anything worth remembering. Sense this game is theonly one of it's kind on steam let alone online that i personaly know about i'd say it's a 6 out of 10 good to unwind but nothing to be impressed with long term.","February 6","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You will only get them if you are online in the game.\n\nYou are able to complete tasks to get some more Chips or even clothes.  There are daily and weekly tasks.\n\n\nOther things.\n\nThere are leaderboards for certain Casino games.\nThere are alot of immature people or people that are offensive and swearing.\nAlot of people do not want to sit next or close to someone else. They prefer to sit in the middle, or having 1 sit next to them empty or they sit entirely alone.\nThe game is sort of addictive, Not because it's a "Gambling" Game. But more it's easy to play and easy pick and leave game.

I'll give it an nine point one. Fun bingo games that overall pay the best. I'm a pretty fair craps player. I play passline with odds and the come with odds but I swear craps kicks my ♥♥♥. I can't figure this out. I'll Have to go back with a system I guess and try again. Overall the game is a blast and it is cool to walk up to a chick and ask her to dance. Most of the time they don't know how to react. Just don't harrass them, please.\nMachine play is pretty normal give and take, I still have not hit a straight!  Good fun and you can spend a few bucks without breaking the bank. Lots of table games that are fun. If you can coerce an invite to the Vip club it gives you a 24 hour pass. That brings with it a Baccarat game and some serious minimums on the other table games. High rollers only (or you can just hang out and see how the other half lives) lol!\nHave a little fun, don't get your undies in a bunch. It's just clean fun.\nHope Digital continues to improve the solid product that they have.\nP.S. If you bingo, a must have is the $4.95 Auto Marker. You can kick back and watch the numbers come in all marked for you. On the longer games you can wander off, have a smoke, vacuum the living room, etc. come back and presto... all of your cards are marked! Way cool. And I'm not a shill for the Devs. Just tryin' to help! Please don't think I'm trying to sell ♥♥♥♥. You get the marker you'll love it\nPPS I hit a straight tonite! celebration time.\nPPPS I won on bingo 50000 last nite and 26000 today.

You get 250 dollars every 15 minutes so if you lose all of your money you dont have to pay for more you can get the free 250 and make some money playing War or Blackjack or something and hopefully go play a better game.","June 25, 2015","true","404.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Sure it may have had some bugs but any idiot who knows that it's new and relatively unpolished and then spends money on chips that they lose (and didn't have to because chips can easily be earned for free, all the time) and didn't report to the devs, who to their credit are very attentive in-game, deserve the loss and should just downrate themselves.\n\nThat being said I'd love to see a little extra in this and hope to eventually!\n- The entire upper deck seems like wasted space with those stores that can be accessed from anywhere, even from the game menus, and feel more like placeholders than anything substantial - could the casino be expanded up there with some more variety?\n- See above - more variety (would be nice to have more than just one slot machine game for example)\n- Interaction beyond just the casino - example, nothing can be done in the apartment other than to sit on things\n- Where's the buffet?!\n","June 10, 2015","true","34.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

I think it deserves higher then a mixed review by far. The game has had some issues with bugs like bingo games freezing and black jack not working, but the devs seem like they are working very hard to fix these issues as fast as possible. And I should also mention that both times i had chips stolen from me from a game bug, I REPORTED the bug and GOT my chips back...so quit whining about losing chips to bugs if your not gonna report it. They have bug and optimizing updates what seems like almost everyday, which only has been improving the experience overall.  The community so far has also been mostly positive while playing. I have only encountered a few jerks so far but most people are on to have fun with everyone. As far as people saying you have to buy chips to get anywhere, they clearly havnt put the time into learning how the games work. Once you learn how machines and tables play with rules and mechanics, it is super easy to make money. I give this game so far a 9/10 if you like casino like games and hanging with people.

I haven't tested every single title, but after spending a chunk of time on several, I can say the following:\n\nPros:\nA good set of titles that all function well; poker is of course only as good as the players you get, but all the basic functionality and pomp is here, combined with the daily tasks and tier increases that made PS Home attractive for folks like me.  It is, in essence, a wide array of gambling options with level ups and leveling bonuses.  That's kind of awesome.\n\nRegular influx of chips.  Playing for free long-term is entirely possible due to getting a decent chunk of chips for free from a number of resources (daily super slots, daily/weekly tasks for more chips, 250 chips every 15 minutes in game), which keeps the title from feeling locked off to any reasonable extent.\n\nLooks great.  Not Skyrim-with-a-million-graphics-mods great, but there's obviously been a lot of work to make the Four Kings look interesting, like the kind of place you could go for a vacation.\n\nCons\nLack of counter of autoplay.  This is a minor quibble but it does frustrate.  I like to play the machine game 'Instant Keno', and it's a bit annoying that when I select the autoplay option that until it gets to the final play, I have no visual indicator how many runs I have left.\n\nWasted space.  I love the nightclub and the apartment!  They look great, and again bring me back to what I liked about Playstation Home.  Except, they have no purpose at present.  The nightclub has the same music as the rest of the game.  The DJ booth, the bars, all have no interactivity.  The apartment is arguably worse, in that while it looks lovely, there's no way to interact with anything in this allegedly personal space, not even the televisions that look for all the world like they SHOULD be interactive.  I don't want these spaces excized, mind you; it helps to separate the title from generic casino titles in a similar vein, but all of the above needs SOME measure of interaction.  Mini-games, additional places to spend chips/RP/etc, looping videos, new music, I don't care what.  But for it to be lacking all of that makes it little more than window dressing.\n\nLimited spending options.  At present, chips let you play games, winning gives you RP, which can be used to buy a SMALL handful of avatar items, and if you earn X amount in a single month, you get VIP access for a month.  And... that's it.  Can't upgrade your apartment, avatar options are super limited, no special entertainment options for expending RP, etc, etc.  I hope this changes, as there's a lot of room here for enhancement of the overall experience beyond the casino games (which, again, work great and are decently diverse).\n\n\nOverall, the game is a recommend.  Yes, it has flaws, and I hope to see the title expand a LOT.  But what is there right now is a complete gambling title with solid gameplay in a good environment with countless options for snagging more chips for free and getting your fix on for the day.  And for an entry price of free, it's hard not to say give it a shot.","June 8, 2015","true","4.3"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","1"

This game also has some cool clothing options. There should be more options for players when no other players are available. No one like to sit at an empty table for 20 mins waiting for people to join. Some of the payouts don't seem to be distributed correctly, especially the Slots. I do like the daily tasks, it gives you something fun to do while you enjoy the games. Overall, the game looks good, has some great giveaways and freebies, seems to be a great social mechanism, but t he game play for each individual game needs some work.

A classy casino with traditional casino games, a VIP lounge, hotel rooms, poker tables, with more planned.\n\nPros\n___\n\n-Realistic games, from periodically shuffling the deck in blackjack, to the betting ranges and free spins with a massive amount of lines to hit on within the slot machines, the games have a nice, realistic feel to them.\n-Population is currently rising, making this community driven game even more fun.\n-Awkward Dancing .\n\nCons\n___\n-Currently, the variety for slots and machine games is limited. The devs DO, however, have intentions to implement more slot machine varieties as well as other games.\n-Some interface issues. Poker in particular has some issues which makes the game less smooth to play, such as all-in not showing the amount all-in'd for.\n\n\nThe devs are dedicated, and often hang out in the game talking to the players. I got to talk with one of the developers about the future of the game, and there's a couple of things to look forward to.\n\n- The Event Room. The future of this room will hold random events, and potentially be used to play games not currently in the casino.\n- Free to play access. While playing in development is fun, and will translate into in-casino rewards upon release, this game will eventually be free to play. You can hop on with some buddies and hit the virtual casino for a night.\n\nThis game is what it promises ; A multiplayer casino with realistic games to play with friends.\n","April 7, 2015","true","129.1"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

Reminds me a bit of the long since cancelled This is Vegas but multiplayer. In this state, there is a lot of variety in the different types of casino games, even if they suffer from the major population issue mentioned below. But at least it isn't just limited to a few of them. Best part is that you don't have multiple spam messages all along your Facebook wall from your parents trying to get chips from you.\n\nGame runs fine on my machine at least and save for one period where I had issues loading the character customizer, everything is fine on a technical standpoint.\n\nThe only thing holding the game back is its lack of players, which due to the social nature of the game seriously harms the game even in this Early Access state. Hopefully once it launches people will give it a look. Maybe if Digital Leisure adds crafting and zombies, people will play it. :)\n\nSome suggestions to the developer for release and beyond:\nFigure out some reason for people to use the nightclub, whether its a drink-serving minigame to earn chips or something else worthwile. Seems useless at this point in time. Same with the Hotel Room. I'd love a GTA style TV where you watch pre-made shows but that's way too expensive for this kind of indie development studio. A possible area for user-generated content perhaps?\n\nMore slot and video blackjack variations.\n\nPoker and Blackjack tournaments.","May 1, 2015","true","19.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

Might be better with consistent players, but probably not much.  All the games are very generic, without any of the themes or personality that make casinos fun.\n\nThe poker room is pretty disappointing, and I don't see any sign in the early access notes of there being plans for any sort of major overhaul here. It's not at all like an actual casino poker room, and seems like it's been designed by someone who doesn't know much about poker. There is no cash games, only sit-and-go style tournaments with extremely fast blind levels that tend to turn the game into an all-in festival within minutes. There is no variety in games. The tables don't even have enough seats for a typical casino poker game. The poker setup seems geared toward getting games over with as quickly as possible.","May 3, 2015","false","7.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","10","18","0","0"

I am very happy to see they have been upgraded to "mostly positive". This game delivers what it promises at a price that cannot be beat. I understand in the beginning there may have been technical issues, and its true the graphics may not be fully optomized, however this seems to have been resolved.\n\nThe games in the casino are fair. If you see reviews indicating the dealers are crooked, or the games are rigged: ignore them. They are written by ignorant players who are unaware that ALL games in a casino are slanted to the houses favor.\n\nThe casino offers many games of chance, some with better odds than others. The blackjack is extremely liberal with a house edge of around .3%. Single Deck Blackjack is available in the VIP lounge which actually has a NEGATIVE house edge.\n\nThe only real negative i can admit to is the fact that it is free to play and that attracts some pretty childish trolls. You can block them. I like to berate them. I find added enjoyment there, but you may find frustration.\n\nOh, and if your table freezes while you have chips on the table, just report it. You will typically get a refund the next day.\n\n\n9/10 , would like to see more games, but very satisfied with what is available.","February 16","true","216.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found The Four Kings Casino while searching for a game i could play together with my son ... and i've found the best place to play several casino games, hang out with my son & meet other people from all around the world :). It's a very addictive game... a place where i wish to come back every day and whenever i can to play & meet my friends. There are slot machines and other machine games like video poker or video Blackjack, you can play Bingo together with up to 40 players, play Blackjack, Poker or War at 6 player tables and many other games. There is never a moment of boredom as you have many goals such as daily & weekly tasks, Tiers, Steam & In-game achievements, tourmnaments, and more. If you should get tired of playing & chatting you even have a hotel room where you can have some time for yourself.\nTrue, this game also has bugs and glitches, such as people getting disconnected (if you loose chips don't worry, i've lost many and all of them have been refunded), but this game has a good Team of dedicated Developers who care about making this game a wonderfull experience for everyone :)","April 15","true","756.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My rating 8 of 10. This is a Must try and see for yourself. Pros: Open world, Multi player, custumization, intovative and really like no other game out there and many more pros. im sure im not listing, because i want to get back on and play poker lol. This game is good!! Needs some kinks worked out. The only one i can think of really at the moment is \"rarly\" the you may buy into a game and get a server disconnect and or game freeze, but this can be very upsetting when you buy in for lets say 25k at the VIP table. However the customer service seems very on top of this issue and if and when this may happens submit a bug report to them \"very easy and fast to do in options setting\" and they will at least be kind enough to refund any buyins lost due to this bug issue. I say it happens rarley because ive played well over a 100 poker sit and goes and this has happen maybe 5 times to me. Things i would like to see happen in this game is: Big texas Holdem events \"freezout tournaments\" another would be a MUCK button i know this sounds lame but sometimes i just want to muck and not check if i know my cards are dead after the flop.... Play this game you will have fun you will laugh at other players dancing and there outfits and much mote. Hope to see you there hope you try it and GL at the tables!!!","May 31","true","169.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The last was lost on slots trying to complete a daily task, I couldn't get it accomplished with days of trying and thousands and thousands in chips thrown away. The game I imagine is trying to get people to spend money on actually buying chips to throw away on pointless "daily" goals.

Especially with friends.\n\nYou get to customize a character, you have your own hotel room, the environments are beautiful, and the games are pretty damn entertaining. I expected to have microtransactions shoved down my throat at every turn, but the starting money is generous and unless you really suck at gambling, it's hard to lose those starting funds (free chips every 15 minutes, free bingo games, chips lying around the casino, and dailies/monthies help earn anything lost back as well). Only other transactions were minor and completely optional, mostly cosmetic.\n\nI don't have many complaints, honestly. I hope to see this game grow and improve, as there's plenty of ways they can expand the experience. I might actually put money into the game purely to support the model they have going. Keep up the good work, guys.\n\nIn short: 10/10 would make friends ragequit by beating their ♥♥♥ at bingo again.","December 29, 2015","true","52.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

If you like casinos/casino games this is well done. The social interaction factor is a great addition. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. However, I am a bit concerned about the requirement in the VIP status section that states "minimum 30 day membership." For those of us who had enough faith in you to buy in as early access founders are you intending to charge a monthly membership fee? Considering your all in pass was almost as much as GTA V I think you would be making a critical error to charge founding members a monthly fee. Biting the hand that fed you could cause a rather nasty backlash. Example being what happened when Steam decided to allow charging a fee for Elder Scrolls V Skyrim mods. That really kicked the hornets’ nest and they quickly rescinded. Think about it gentlemen.","May 25, 2015","true","107.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

If you like casinos/casino games this is well done. The social interaction factor is a great addition. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game. However, I am a bit concerned about the requirement in the VIP status section that states "minimum 30 day membership." For those of us who had enough faith in you to buy in as early access founders are you intending to charge a monthly membership fee? Considering your all in pass was almost as much as GTA V I think you would be making a critical error to charge founding members a monthly fee. Biting the hand that fed you could cause a rather nasty backlash. Example being what happened when Steam decided to allow charging a fee for Elder Scrolls V Skyrim mods. That really kicked the hornets’ nest and they quickly rescinded. Think about it gentlemen.","May 25, 2015","true","107.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I understand that there can be some compatibility issues within the game, and a list of bugs (especially when it's in early access) but honestly, the whole atmosphere/environment in this game is great.\n\nObviously, if you're not into games a casino would feature (like poker, blackjack, 6wheel, slots etc) then you'll probably not like this game. But with the features included in this game, such as the limited freeroam offered within a virtual-type casino is quite unique and it gives some quality to the game. This game reminds me of the good old playstation home, it's really nice. I've already invited a handful of friends to play the game with me and they've also enjoyed it. So far, the players within the community are all quite mature and are really enjoying the game.\n\nAlthough I would like to see if there is some kind of forum or website where you can hand out some suggestions or help in regards to playing the game. If by any chance, someone does have a link, I would appreciate if someone would send me the link.\n\nAnyways, great game guys, I recommend it!","June 19, 2015","true","13.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

(for reference I can run Planetside 2 at 35FPS with this rig.)  That is beside the point though.  There is a game here, where you can go almost anywhere you'd go in a normal casino, and you get 250 free chips every 15 minutes.  The theory is solid, but the execution is inevitably boring.\n\nWalking around with 400,000 chips from my slot jackpot, I found that there was absolutely no way to splurge my money.  I played literally every game in the casino 20 or so times and still couldn't throw away my money.  That's not a bad thing, but normally in my situation, a player would be having major fun.  I think it's the fact that there is NOTHING to spend chips on aside from the crappy games that take forever to even get going.  Once I got into the VIP area, I figured all of this would be different... but the VIP area is just the same as the non-VIP area with 2 different games and the same level of boredom.  I would say the rating system kept me going, but there was no actual pride to be had with it... yeah I'm tier 12 at poker.. what do I get?  Nothing.  Tier 25?  Nothing.  Lets not delude the fact that even if there were a prize, there would be nothing to do with it\n\nIn summary, the game is a borefest with a casino skin.  If you like sitting around pretending to play poker and blackjack, then this game might be for you.  But if you are a normal human being who enjoys mental stimulation... Steer clear of this waste of time.","June 11, 2015","false","11.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I mainly got this game due to searching for casino based game on steam to feel a gap from test drive unlimited 2's casino (which I played on console) and I am not disappointed. Sure it still needs tweaking and more options but overall seems like it will do well if it can get the player base.","April 8, 2015","true","45.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

(N*tEnt show a good list of table game that can VS dealer)\n\nFinally, the music is boring and need more music.\n\nBut still, recommend this game so more people can join this community.","April 27, 2015","true","10.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

This game has a lot of potential.  Currently you can purchase chips for free or earn them through game play.  Try it out now while it's free if you are interested in casino simulators.  The games all function well and there are customization options for your character as well as a club with a dance floor for socializing.

So far it seems like a well made casino game. I definitely recommend you try it if you are a fan of casino/ gambling games. Really its biggest draw back at the moment is that there just are not enough people playing. There definitely needs to be more people in game.   It could also use with some more variation in the casino games/ themes. while there are a good variety of games to play, each game is copy pasted in every room in the casino. We could definitely use more than one type of slot machine, ect.\n\nI cant think of any other real negatives. its definitely worth a try.","May 19, 2015","true","6.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"
