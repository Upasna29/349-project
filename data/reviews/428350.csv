The biggest thing worthy of praise is the depth of this game - I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface. Between micro-managing supply raids, fuel consumption calculation, monitoring radio chatter, social engineering in the carriages, tense diplomacy between factions, monitoring dreams, and power management, this game is huge. If you like deep strategic games, you should get this.\n\nIt's also a spectacular example of story-telling and atmosphere - throughout the game, you stand in 3 spots in 1 room, and the world feels big and epic and real. You feel terrified for the fate of little blobs on a radar. You feel scared because people you never see might not like you - or like you a bit too much.\n\nIt works brilliantly as a train simulator. It's a great roguelike. It's a fantastic real-time strategic action game. This game is better at multiple genres than many games dedicated to just one genre are.\n\nI cannot recommend this highly enough.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73chxXs67z0","January 22","true","9.9"," 60 of 63 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","60","63","4","2"

Fear Equation is a horror game set aboard a train, what role do you play? You are the engineer! Or well I guess the guy who runs the entire train aswell, you are given certain areas to view things and interact such as the notebook which is where you will decide who does what via a lottery (Which I believe you can rig so only certain people get chosen) and upgrades, Defence building and Dream Logs. There is a computer which you do all the scavenging from and listening to comms. The front is where you man the train and decide where to go, if you stop the train and turn of the Throttle the battery will drain and if it runs out the entire train will go dark and depending on how long it's out for will depend on how many people disapear and never return, you however are completely safe. The back of the train is where you sleep and hope everything will be Okay!\n\n---Gameplay---\nOne part you have to study dream logs and then counter possible threats depending on how many people are having said things in their dreams with defences such as barricades, heat etc, you have no other control over what they do. You can increase power to their carridges though I haven't found a use or problem for doing so as the tutorial seemed to just stop abruptly which in a sense is good as what's scary about a game when you know how to do everything. On the computer you will do scavenging which is similar to Dreadnaught except you only plan what they do and how long and then sit back and watch, make sure you have enough time as if the fog rolls in and they are in there then people will start disapearing and never been again. You use resources from that time in the next day where you build the defences and upgrades etc.\n\n--Is it Scary?--\nI'd say there's more tension than actual horror in this game, there are some creepy scenes you will see at night through visions of sorts but nothing that will make you jump out for your seat (Though I haven't died or hopefully not seen all the scenes yet).\n\n--Custom Game--\nThis is a mode where you can choose from either preset cards with their own settings or create your own Engineer with custom or preset profile picture, you decide how hard or how easy the game will be, think the fog gets dense to fast? Choose the slow fog modifier. Think getting upgrades for something is too hard? Get it full upgraded. Think upgrading make the game to easy? Block the ability to upgrade. You can choose multiple ones to properly define your experience.\n\n--Conclusion--\nI'd say for the Current price it's worth it, there's a lot of content and even custom which I haven't checked out yet but I will and update this review later. I give it a 9.5/10 For being a very unique and fun experience.\n\n--YouTube--\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv9D6LJ0jH4","January 15","true","2.0"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","42","54","5","0"

It blends the people management from Zafehouse: Diaries and the mission systemd from Deadnaut, without being super sophisticated. The learning curve is small, and you get the hang of things very quickly. It is very difficult, even with some of the easier engineers (engineers are the person you play as). I was a little hesitant at the beginning worrying that it would be too complicated and I would want to stop, but worked through my first few days on the train, got the hang of it, and was sucked into it for hours (And then died, customized the passengers as my friends, and started again.)\n\nAs usual with Screwfly games there is a cool customization feature, where you can create your friends, family, and yourself as the engineer of the train and see them all show up. When creating a passenger it is pretty simple and straightforward, and includes ways to increase stats like choosing their occupation. There is also a pretty wide variety of portraits the game comes with for faces of your custom passengers, or if you're really into it you can put your friends' actual faces into the game folder and use it in-game. Lastly on the custom passengers there is a three question sheet that determines what faction that passenger will usually be in, and how influenciual they will be to other passengers in their carriage.\nYou can also customize you engineer, the portraits are the same and you can choose different atributes for your engineer that will make the game easier/harder.\n\nI would recommend this game to most everyone, and I hope you enjoy playing.","January 17","true","5.8"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

It seemed relatively simple and I wondered where the "game" was.\n\nHowever, I wanted to give it a chance, if for no other reason than being sick to death of games that focus on the "immediate" attention grab at the expense of depth and longevity.\n\nI'm glad I did! I makes me think of things like FTL or Magic: The Gathering, where it's not about a big single thing that takes you to victory, but small advantages over the long run that get you over the line.\n\nKudos to the dev.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chieviousmiss/recommended/428350/","chieviousmiss","chieviousmiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chieviousmiss/","23 products in account","Overall, a visually beautiful, slower-paced game that reqiures you to manage the resources on the train, assign passengers to carriages based on their factions to prevent internal conflicts, and build defenses against the fog. Once you reach a destination, you can send passengers out to search for items/food/fuel, either through a random lottery or by rigging the lottery to send your stronger passengers.\n\nIt's not a reactive game, like Deadnaut, instead you plan ahead and then watch it executed. Personally I prefer this style, but I tend to like management games anyway.\n\nFor few tips from my few hours playing:\n*Pressing TAB skips to the next phase (Lottery, Orders, Work, Guard), and also helps you fall asleep quicker after you've clicked on the bed.\n*If the train is moving don't bother doing the lottery, just keep an eye on which day you're planning on arriving at the next town and only use the lottery then. Just TAB passed it to Orders.\n*Don't allocate too many orders. I was confused at first, but the greyed-out boxes in each carriage page are the orders they are working on. Too many ongoing orders increases your chaos level, so stick to one or two until they're done.\n*When scavaging, you attract less fog if the engine is off. Turn the engine off by taking the throttle down to zero (to the left). But beware: if you run out of battery power when scavaging you might find some of your passengers that weren't scavaging have died.\n*Increasing the power to a carriage seems to make them work faster/more efficiently.","January 15","true","17.4"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

I wish there was a better system in steam then just yay or nay? Because this game kind of leans closer to the middle then being outright bad.\n\nThat said it has some problems that need to be ironed out but can, and probably will, be fixed.\n\n1.	Mrjihun pointed out the save problem has been explained. Thanks Mrjihun!\n\n2.	After the fog attacks give me a summary of the damage that occurred. Lack of information isn’t just damaging to gameplay, it’s also boring in a game that is all about information and the decisions you make.\n\n3.	Fuel needs to be much more common because a “Hail Mary” should be a last resort when the random number generator really messed you up, not something you do regularly.\n\n4.	I understand the limitation to only sending five passengers out at once to scavenge for both technical and story based reasons. That said what I don’t understand is the mission team not bringing everyone you meet onboard the train, or as the “driver” my having the option to revisit a location to grab supplies they skipped out on the first trip. I admit I may have missed key details about how missions work but I remind you of the tutorial problem for any error on my part with this criticism.\n\n5.	The game feels generally vague and brief about everything it tries to explain. That said at the same time much of what I little I actually do feels like it’s largely out of my hands, and decided by the random number generator.\n\nThis game like previous Screwfly Studios games is all about information and decisions. The problem is the information I am given regularly doesn’t feel exciting or interesting, which the same goes for the defences/upgrades I am building, or the passengers I am managing. The first exciting thing to have happened to me was when the train was attacked by the fog, but a lack of details about what happened made it very anti-climactic. The next exciting thing was reaching a town after six long days of skipping time, ended up being significantly less interesting then searching a house in Zafehouse diaries, when it should have been at least as interesting.\n\nI suspect it gets better when you have a larger train population so you can actually get faction intrigue. But the trip to get there is too boring and devoid of interesting things for me to do to be worthwhile. However considering Zafehouse Diaries again, I didn’t particularly enjoy that game when it was first released either but the developers made significant strides to improve it afterwards. So this review maybe entirely useless in six months, but for now I can’t recommend this game.","January 21","false","2.5"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","3"

Let me explain why that is.\n\nIt lacks stories and that is the biggest issue making it repeating. Yes it has a clear main story: you're the engineer in charge of train and your main goal is to get as many survivors as possible to escape from the fog and reach the final destination. But the problem is the journey to that final revelation. Honestly I don't mind going through same game phases such as lottery, orders, work, and guard but it's a pain to do them in a dull way as the game moves on. Basically there is no story-based events like side quests, hazards, or accidents when going through all of the game phases. You just set where you wanna go and manage the resourses, inculding passengers, fuel tanks, food supplies, etc. Don't get me wrong. I love micromanaging but not in a boring way. So what I do is to make sure my passengers that I assign to scavenge stay alive when they are searching that area. Also build defense against the fog attacks at the last game phase. That's it, that's the main part of the game. If you're a fan of strategy board games, you might enjoy reading intriguing narritives on your quest cards. In this game, nothing; only random fog attacks and dispute of passengers with no stories or narritives.\n\nIt's not a bad game though, but definetly need to put depth in it. Give it a try, but do it on sale since it's not worth $15.","February 1","false","4.0"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

It's irritating having to switch between the notebook and the sections of the train just to check the current time.\nBeing able to set priorities. I normally stack up a few things for the passengers to do so they're never left idle, but this becomes a problem when one thing always has priority.\nA slight bit more interactivity with the environment. This is just a small thing, but I'd like to be able to turn off the lights in my bed area, or set the timer on the computer for no reason, or just to turn the radio off.\nDifferent views for the modifiers in custom mode.

You are a conductor on a train that is one of the only sanctuaries of a fog that's covered the city. This fog is dangerous, and manifests itself into the nightmares people have. Your job is to get as many people out in your train as possible. The premise is simple, but while playing you will discover there are a LOT of moving parts. There's a lot to read, learn, and keep track of. Each passenger you pick up has their own opinions about you, their fellow passengers, and even the fog. Keeping them docile is important. You have to make sure they don't hate you or they will revolt. Also make sure they don't like you too much, or they will kill everyone who hates you. Outside the train is just as dangerous. There is the military that will shoot anything that moves and the fearless, who believe they are allies to the fog. You encounter these when you send passengers out for supplies.\n\nAs difficult as the game might sound, there is a lot of options for customizing your train ride out of the fog. You can mix and match different perks that help or hurt you, and you can make custom passengers with their own skills. As an added bonus, you can hook Twitch chat up to the game and make the viewers passengers on the train.\n\nSo together, it's a really fun game although difficult at first.

It runs good, it has good graphics. But the gameplay is just wonky and strange.\nUnless i am an idiot (Prob am) it does not tell you how to upgrade your trains fuel or Structural integrity and also does not tell you how to move passengers to another car. It does have a spooky atmosphere though and i do like that. The other thing is the movement, it seems delayed, which would be no big deal if the tutorials tought you more.\n\nPros: Good Graphics, Cool Concept, Management Sim.\n\nCons: Minimal Tutorial system makes it very confusing by only telling you basics.\nConfusion Confusion Confusion.\nThe tutorial is the only thing this game needs more of, If it would teach you how to do more things i would play it more. (I have read all the notes i have found and i still don't know how to play the game fully, been on 2 scavenge runs and stopped on the 3rd.)\n\nIs it worth it? If you want to "Try" to learn the more advanced mechanics then be my guest. If you are looking for quick fun than stay away from this.\nI have applied for a refund on this, Maybe if it's better in the future i'll buy it. But at the moment i just can't be bothered to play it.\nSorry dev's, no hard feelings though.\n\n(Do not hate me because my Opinion is Different than your's, Everyone has one, I'm just voicing mine.)","January 21","false","1.0"," 6 of 22 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","6","22","0","0"

I want to first state that I appreciate Screwfly's commitment to making unusual games, with unusual game mechanics.\n\nSadly, I don't feel the game is, well, fun. I'd just rather be playing something else. There's a level of abtruseness to some aspects of the design that would take a lot of time and effort to learn how to use correctly, and the game just isn't fun enough to warrant that time investment.\n\nI can't recommend it, at least not to people like myself. I think there is a niche here, so if you want to try a really original game design, or if you just want to support developers who are willing to try new things, give the game a play.","January 15","false","1.1"," 25 of 71 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","25","71","3","2"

Some games liek Crusader Kings 2 make you want to learn the game and become emersed in it; not so for Fear Equation.  Even in tutorial the bland layout, confusing directions, not knowing what relates to what.. just awful awful execution.  Give some orders like building and not know how to do anything else (fast forward time) click a direction the train goes (fast forward time) go to sleep (fast forward time) everyone is dead... restart and repeat with the same lack of instructions.  The point and click system is horrible.  I was clicking on EVERYTHING and all I could do was read instruction manuals that would guide me in a meaningless way because I couldn't click on anything like character portraits to equip them or orders... nothing.  Avoid this one as I go to get my money back.","January 17","false","0.6"," 5 of 35 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","5","35","2","0"
