The first game did this perfectly with great humor and a wonderful gameplay , incorporating REAL planes and what not , its a masterpiece.....\n\nSo come to the present , Balive releases this horror as the sequel to the first game...by gods its horrible it totally ditched everything that made the first game great, Game runs on a rotten engine , doubt anyone would play it more than a hour, no Real plane names, No humor nothing just a bunch of guys with big Heads running around ackwardly.\n\nTo Pour more salt to the injury\n-They implemented the suggestions made by the community as DLCs\n-They are done with the game just repackaged it as gold edition , just check the forums the game is still horrible\n-dont expect even cards for the game http://forum.kalypsomedia.com/showthread.php?tid=20275\n-modding is bare minimum , a few exist but dont do much to improve the game\n\nAvoid it , unless its on a massive sale if you want the real airline tycoon experience get the first game on steam.\nSad to see us the fans of classic get such a horrible sequel\nNot so epic screenshots of the game...\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/liquidsnakehpks/screenshots/?appid=201490&sort=newestfirst&browsefilter=myfiles&view=grid","November 25, 2013","false","8.3"," 145 of 158 people (92%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","92","145","158","3","3"

So now I'm dedicating an hour to each of these games and writing a series of One Hour Reviews.\n\nOne Hour Reviews - Game 5\nAirline Tycoon 2\nPurchase Date: 9/11/2014\n\nLike a number of games in my Steam library, I came across Airline Tycoon 2 as part of a Humble Bundle.  I really like Humble Bundle because not only do I get to donate to a good cause, but sometimes in that bundle I'll come across a really good game that I never would have bought otherwise.\n\nSadly, Airline Tycoon 2 is not one of those games.\n\nRight off the bat the game scored a negative when I realized I'd have to login to play this game.  Given that this is a completely single player game with no internet component whatsoever, I really don't see the point in forcing me to login.  The only thing that kept this from being more annoying is apparently I've played some other game from Kalypso, so it remembered my login from that.  So at least I didn't have to make another account.\n\nAirline Tycoon 2 tries to inject some humor by presenting you with various cariactures of people like Albert Einstein, who is exactly the person that comes to mind when I need an airline mechanic.  You know, cause he's smart.  This is the kind of humor you get to look forward to in Airline Tycoon 2.\n\nI played through the tutorial, which does a decent enough job of introducing you to the game concepts.  It sent me around the airport to talk to various people, so I could meet all of the goofy characters the game has to offer.  It doesn't sound so bad when I say it, but eventually you get tired of running around the airport to visit the mechanic or go to the personnel office to hire a pilot, or hightail it back to your office to plan an airline route.\n\nImagine playing a city builder except every time you wanted to build a new building, you had to run over to the mayors office and talk to a caricature of the Godfather so you could tell him you want to zone a new block of houses.\n\nSo once I talk to Albert Einstein to get my plane decked out, and talk to someone else to get my pilot and crew hired, and someone else to actually tell my crew which plane they are working on, after all that then I can find the manager, so I can rent a route to fly my plane on.  They should have put out a version of this game for the Wii that is compatible with the Wii Fit balance board.\n\nAfter all that, I can head back to my office to plan my flights for the week.   It's a bit like setting up meetings in outlook where each route takes up a chunk of time for the day, so the idea is you slot in as many round trips as you can, with some occasional maintenance inbetween flights.  You can also set the ticket price on your flights.  As the day progresses you can check on your flights and get statistics on things like how satisfied your passengers were and how much money your flight made.\n\nThe tutorial did fine at showing me around and introducing me to people I'd rather not talk to, but it doesn't really explain much about the actual strategy in the game.  For instance, there are a ton of different planes you can buy, and lots of ways to tailor how the plane looks, both exterior and interior.  But I have no idea if it's purely cosmetic or if these choices somehow impact customer satisfaction.\n\nThat's really where I ended up at the end of my first hour, wondering how and if my choices affected anything.  In the end, I realized that there's really only one choice that matters, and that is the choice not to play this anymore.\n\nOverall Recommendation:  Pass","June 15, 2015","false","0.9"," 125 of 146 people (86%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","86","125","146","30","4"

There are only 4 airlines to choose from, which are rigid and uncustumizable. The aircraft customization options themselves are laughable; only 8 aircraft to choose from regardless of any realism (the concorde becomes a short haul, high passenger, profitable aircraft) with very limited options. The indoor cabin design is a joke: the developers wouldn't bother to make the different indoor environment for the different aircraft, so the inside of your jumbo jet is the same as that of your small propeller airliner. Furthermore you just choose preset items for the whole aircraft and can't for example have multiple class aircraft, but this doesnt change anything anyway since the price for all tickets is always the same.\n\nAlso personel management is ridiculous: you hire people with the skills they come with and you can't train them further, so your only way to improve your staff is to fire them and get new ones. You can only assign one set of staff to an aircraft, so basically it's the same pilot flying that airplane 24/7 for a whole month. Call the worker's syndicate!!! For those of you who are politically minded it's also nice to notice here that the game is stereotipically sexist: all pilots are males and all flight attendants female.\n\nThe main part of the game and where you will spend the most time with is the scheduling; it looks intricate at first, but after a few hours you find out it totally lacks any realism. The amount of passengers only depends on the demand and you can program your flights at basically any time of the day, hello 2AM departures! Basically your sucess at the game just depends on cramming the biggest number of route and charter flights in the schedule rather than making regular flights (the flight numbering system is automated and wonky).\n\nThe user interface is atrocious in the whole game, you have to physically walk to different offices, with loading screens, to get going. While the idea is commendable, it will soon become a chore and you will soon give up booking charter flights just because they require constant walking outside your office (loading screen), to the elevator (loading screen) to the charter office so you can grab a few contracts, and then the same annoying way back so you can schedule them.\nThe options are so limited and not user friendly at all, the tooltips are inconsistent and unclear over the board. The scheduling board is extremely poorly designed. It's hard to place the flights with precision, the "repeat schedule" option, which is meant to allow you to hold regular flight is the most user unfriendly ever and simply doesn't work. Any flights that take off before midnight and land after midnight will break this feature. Also you are forced to do some makeshift workarounds, like setting the schedule you want to repeat for tomorrow, then waiting a whole day before deciding to repeat it, because the game doesnt let you modify today's schedule, but it only allow you to copy today's schedule, not another days... so user unfriendly it's a crime. And did I mention the annoying "clear flight schedule" button located next to other buttons, which will wipe all the work you did without a confirmation screen?\n\nThe game itself is also full of bugs. The schedule locks itself frequently for no reason, the text doesn't match your actual objective, you get teleported back to your office when looking at a competitor's aircraft, the tutorials (which are themselves rather useless) get stuck while in progress, so you have to repeat the same actions twice.\n\nThe game does have a cute little design feel to it with some pretty cool airplane models (the airbus 380 with full ringed wings and 8 engines for example, or the cute curvy concorde), but this doesn't save it from the abysmal depth, or lack of depth, that it sinks into. Most people play simulation games because they enjoy some variety and custom options. In this game:\n* You cannot rename anything (airlines, aircraft, staff)\n* There is only 1 airport interior, all airports in the world are the same\n* There is only 1 aircraft interior\n* None of your choices has any real effect on the game anyway.\n* Regardless of which mission you are in, or sandbox mode, you start each day at 9AM with a speech from the airport director, the speech is always the same and he repeats it 3 times as well for each of your competitor airlines.\n\nPlaying this feels about as fun as groundhog day happening to you...\navoid!","December 29, 2013","false","6.3"," 53 of 63 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","53","63","2","2"

Was looking for a fun business sim type game, but this wasn't it.\nYou only "work" an 8 hour day, but schedule planes for 24 hours, so at the end of the day, you have to "end" even if you're not done with your day.\nThe game over complicates some things and other things it doesn't even give you an idea of how you're doing.  The banking system charges outrageous interest rates for loans.  The interiors of the aircraft are... unexplainable.  The cost of aircraft is weird, the aircraft are weird, hiring aircrews isn't completely understood.  There is a whole shady side to the game where you can cause problems on a competitor's airline, but it's not even clear what the point of that is.  Simply stated, there's no balance to the game, it's just a poorly designed and executed game that should not have been released.\n\nSorry, but I cannot recommend this game.","October 16, 2014","false","26.5"," 35 of 35 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","35","35","0","0"

So I've bought this game a long time ago. And I don't know where to start. The nice thing about the first Airline Tycoon was the nice balance between realism (stats) and fun (dialogs). You got real planes with real stats, the flight managing was fast and intuitive. But AT2 is the opposite of this. You have a little ammout of fictional planes (yes, they are customisable, that's a nice feature, but that's all). All of them are really ugly. Dialogs are boring and you can feel the failed attepts to make a joke.\n\nAnd that's not enough! Without both DLCs, you're gonna miss features from previous AT like shares, last-minutes, cargo and so on... What the hell is this logic? These features are something that made oroginal AT fun. Basic AT2 without DLCs is just boring and the DLCs are not worth the price, because it will make the game's value higher to get the features that should be in the base game already.\n\nAnd don't even ask about the performance. I'll tell you just two words - it's terrible.","March 16, 2014","false","19.9"," 41 of 49 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","41","49","0","0"

I'm quite into sim games in general, but this game really did not cut it for me.\n\nIn this game you play a cartoonish airline manager (there are a few to choose from, each with their own special trait like getting better deals at on-flight meals) and you have to be the most succesful one: aka be the most profitable. You buy planes for your fleet and customize to your liking, balancing airplane quality, fly range, maintenance and transport size. You can also buy plance from the scrapyard, which is a nice touch but I doubt beneficial due to very high maintenance and the planes often being too outdated (yes, planes technology evolves in this game). You have to get your crew together (balancing skills versus salary), arrange stuff for you planes, etc.\n\nBut in the end there is one mayor issue: the game is TERRIBLY slow. You (and your competitors) advance at the speed of a snail... While this does resemble real life better, it sadly just isn't fun. This combined with a very steep learning curve as the tutorial just doesn't cut it, causing me to feed that I really have no idea what I'm doing nor what I ought to do. And that's bad for a sim game. You should have the feeling that your decision matters and you should get feedback on the consequences of you choices. But sadly, it takes too long to get that feedback and if easy to miss it as the gains are often very small.\n\nThis game disappointed me. If your time is valuable to you, try some other game instead of this one.

It presents a complex economic simulation, customizable planes, interesting charecters and interesting mechanics.\n\nSo why did I rate this game negativly?\n\nThe original game did all that, only better. The simulation  and mechanics were almost exactly the same, the original game's charecters and sense of humor are far superior, (Airline Tycoon 2's comedy falls completly flat) and in my opinion the ability to buy real-world planes in the original was better.\n\nThe game suffers from graphics that lag greatly in the terminal, and look overly cartoony, and the music is terrble.\n\nNormally, I do not mind DLC, and I think it is worthwhile to support the developers if it is farily priced. However, this game's DLC feels like they took some of the most interesting parts of the orginal (Cargo and last minute contracts) and made you pay more for it.\n\nThe BIGGEST PROBLEM with this game is the pacing. In the original Airline Tycoon you can easily make over 500,000 dollers from the begining of the game, and in a little over a week by your next plane, which makes it easier to buy the next plane. The pacing is helped by the fact you can skip the morning meeting, and there are no loading screens. On the other hand Airline Tycoon 2 is hampered by the fact that planes 3 or 4 times as expensive, and they make substantialy less money per day than in Airline tycoon deluxe. Compounded with the HORRIBLE LOADING TIMES, it can take HOURS to purchase another plane. This game moves at a glacial pace.\n\nCONCLUSION; If you want an tycoon game in which you manage an airline, DO NOT CHOSE AIRLINE TYCOON 2. You should go with the much cheaper, original Airline Tycoon deluxe!\n\nBy the way, I know some people are concerned about giving their email adress to the launcher.

But here go’s anyway.\n\nFrom starting the game it is immediately obvious that they are going for the same look and feel such as classics like “Theme Hospital” or “Pizza Tycoon”. It however fails miserably. The graphics are cartoony and simple, which is fine. But do not seem to run very smooth, even though they are of low-quality.\n\nThe interface is cluttered and cumbersome. You are actually required to walk from place to place getting a loading screen every time you pass a door. This started to annoy me relatively quickly, but let’s let that slide. To do almost anything you will have to talk to the correct character, of course all located in different rooms and none of which connect directly. Every character is an over the top caricature, unfortunately I just found them annoying in varying degrees.\n\nSo how’s the gameplay. Once again, let me say I never got passed the tutorial, but for me, the main issues of running an airline got completely lost in the struggle to complete irrelevant details. Personally I was hoping for more of a “Transport Tycoon” approach.\n\n3/10\n\n+ High customisability\n\n- To painful interface to actually play\n- Falls flat on its face every time it tries to be funny\n- To many load screens","November 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It is not a very pleasant one, though. Airline Tycoon 2 is confusing at best. There are numerous unwarranted stereotypes portrayed in uncanny valley style graphics. I went far enough to see what the gameplay is like, and it is not enough to tempt any more time out of me. The game's font is almost unreadable even at the highest graphics setting. The gameplay doesn't make sense, either. I'm not saying it's particularly complicated (there honestly isn't that much going on) it's just not logical. I'm also pretty sure one of the store owners is implying you can solicit her for sexual activities. This game would most likely be more successful as a dating sim if they decided to expand it in that regard, but even then it wouldn't be worth the curiosity.

At first, I chalked it up to unfairly comparing this game to its predecessor so I gave it a chance.  After a few attempts and a few short sessions every couple weeks, culminating to approx 16 hours, I decided it's time to uninstall this piece of trash.\n\nNow that the personal anecdote is out of the way, here is where I think this game fails.\n\nI'm sure most people got turned off by the fact that you have to move around the airport to do things like in a point-and-click adventure game, instead of just looking at spreadsheets from like other "tycoon" games. The first game did that too, but in that one, the airport was a 2D enviornment and everything was easy to find, and it was easy to get to places quickly. Here, however, you move really slow in a full 3D enviornment that makes your video card chug away for no real reason.\n\nWhich brings me to my next point, the graphics. Don't get me wrong, I know graphics don't make the game and I am not criticizing about the choice of style. I'm talking about the unessisary details in this game. When all you are really doing is scheduling flights for your planes do you really care about the ammount of bloom in the main terminal? You would if it's causing your middle-end hardware to lag.\n\nThe thing this game has going for it (what the other game lacks) is custom designs of the plane's interiors, livery colors, decals. Unfortuantly all those areas are limited, you only have a few color choices, and half of them are the established color schemes of the featured (uncustomizable) airlines. Instead of buying real world planes like the Airbus A320 or the Boeing 737, you instead have to build planes from scratch from a limited set of parts. Another feature this game has is that you can view your plane in flight. All these things are pointless, unless you entertained by the sight of your butt-ugly plane in it's butt-ugly $-sign decals bob up and down in front of a sky backdrop.\n\nNewcomers to the series hate it for its limiting and unconvential style and fans of the first game hate it for dumbing it down. Spend your $20 elsewhere.\n\nEDIT: Airline Tycoon Deluxe is now available on Steam, I recomend you check that out.","January 20, 2014","false","16.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I got it off the Humble Bundle and wanted something nice that was a bit fancier than a facebook game. The end result? A mess.\n\nGraphically, it isn't terrible. However, the carnage of steryotypes and cliches that end up nowhere and seemingly dead end gags will make your eyes bleed. They tried too hard to make a comical cartoonish game, and crashed into the state of "slightly visibly better" than a Facebook game. I mean it does have graphics[i/].\n\nGameplay wise, it is even worse[i/]. Unless you personally developed this game, get ready for a steep learning curve....for all the wrong reasons. The tutorial refers to buttons not readily seen in some cases, or gets stuck, as a matter of example. In general play, there are buttons upon buttons and settings buried everywhere.\n\nIt really doesn't help, that they tried to be fancy in splitting the various management categories in different "offices", for instance: assigning routes to planes is in a wholly different office from getting contracts and routes. (Not to mention routes are buried when playing in freeplay). Also who puts the painting for aircraft away from the hangar??!! I get that it is design....but...why? Why have another office????\n\nLastly, it is utterly boring yet incredibly hectic. There is an 8 hour day and everything happens at so fast you can barely finish getting an aircraft. In freeplay, there is literally not enough time to set up one route, for one aircraft, grab a crew (and if you purchased many aircraft you won't be given enough crew), design the aircraft, assign the aircraft. Where somehow, your competitors have several routes by the end of the day and are smoking you. The game, does become boring once the hecticness settles down. All you do then is stare at a screen and try to imagine planes flying.\n\nOverall, this games gets a 4 cupcakes out of 10. Because I would only trade four for this which I hope was an indie game. It still needs polish.\n\n","November 4, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its a fantastic concept. For those who are interested in Airline Management, it will be fun.\n\nIts a great time passer. The Graphics are good too.\n\nThe sad thing about this game is that it had alot of potential to be fantasic. I think they should have included, or maybe if there is ever a Airline Tycoon 3, airports such as Amsterdam, Warsaw, Jakarta and Helsinki should have been included. Also maybe Tel Eviv, Riyadah, Melbourne, Brisbane and Suva. Also, I think it would be great if you were able to customize the logos, uniform and more indepth customization of aircraft. You should also be able to create your airline name and should be able to customize the characters, or create them. There should be more characters. Airline cleaners should be included in the game, and you should have some kind of control over the check in and ground staff too. Should be able to have control over the gate, and have more than one gate as there may be more than one aircraft departing from an airport from the same airline at a time. Office Branches would be good, unless you can already do that, I have not tried it. The routes should be more flexible and also be able to have layovers, connections ect as a flight from eg: New York to Perth Australia direct is unrealistic and stupid. I think the food catering aspect could be more detailed too.\nThis game is loosly a good game, but it could be so much better. I really do hope there is a third sequel.\n","March 30, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

If I don't recomend a game, that means it was at least partially enjoyable and a decent value. That's not remotely case here. This game is the most incredible pile of playable cyber garbage I've ever seen. There's a saying that if you have an infinite ammount of time and monkeys on typwriters that one of them could reproduce the works of Shakepere. Well this in this case a few code monkeys in 8 years  produced the only thing that has ever want to go back in time and kill myself before I bought it. This isn't even a polished turd, not even a turd turd If all I knew was this game and then along came a turd, the turd would be the greatest thing to happen in all of Civilization. Pyramids, Code of Laws, Apollo 11, Turd. And I even bought the DLC! Because why not? It's the summer sale and it's cheap! If given the opportunity I'd take the $12 I spent on this vile creation and buy a ticket to the midnight showing of "The Dark Night Rises" in Aurora.","July 22, 2012","true","0.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","23","3","13","4","0"

Sure, I've only played 44 minutes as of writing this paragraph, and sure, those 44 minutes occurred 3.5 months ago, but the awfulness was so indellibly printed on my subconscious that even looking at the title I get angry.\n\nThe idiotic cartoonishness of the whole thing has the potential to be the worst thing about the game.  I get it, it's not real life, but that doesn't mean it should look like a game made for 5-year-olds (unless it IS made for 5-year-olds, in which case I feel a little silly now...).\n\nThe UI is absolutely horrendous.  Want to buy a new plane?  You have to navigate your ridiculous-looking avatar through a side-scrolling terminal at an abysmally slow pace.  Want to set up a new route between cities?  Run through the same stupid terminal at the same slow pace back to the control room.  Then, try to figure out the cryptic route planner.  Made a mistake planning the route?  Good luck figuring out how to undo it.\n\nIf this were the first ever "tycoon" game, maybe I could be a little more forgiving, but they have plenty of good examples to work from and they still managed to screw it up.\n\nWell, I've vented my rage, so now I can go back to something else.","January 22, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, upon playing a game in Airline Tycoon 2 I could see that this one would be much harder than others. Navigation around the airport is actually frustrating (Things like your character breaking into a run, but then switching back to a walk briefly before running again.) There is an airport brochure that makes navigation much easier by telling you all the hotkeys, however even with that the whole game seems far too simple to be classified as a "Really intense strategy game... if you enjoy games like Civilization, Crusader Kings 2, Europa Universalis IV or Total War." Now I play all those other ones. A huge total of combined hours across these titles, and this game in NO ways even came close to them. It was clunky, loaded a new screen everytime you entered/left a room in the airport (each room was tiny, why need loading screens??). For a game that came out in 2011 I was quite disappointed. Many of Kalypso's other games far outshine this one.","February 17, 2015","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I get it, it's not real life, but that doesn't mean it should look like a game made for 5-year-olds (unless it IS made for 5-year-olds, in which case I feel a little silly now...).\n\nThe UI is absolutely horrendous.

Run through the same stupid terminal at the same slow pace back to the control room.  Then, try to figure out the cryptic route planner.  Made a mistake planning the route?

I have played it and tried hard to like it. I just can't. I wanted to enjoy playing Airline Tycoon 2 so much, but it was a swing and a miss. The Freemode is lackluster which is what you play after beating the rest a few times over. Free mode should offer a challenge that varies game by game based on the AI... The game is pretty much a rinse and repeat of 1 of 2 strategy choices.\n\n1) Buy a brand new, reliable plane, keep chugging along and slowly take over your enemies knowing you have your reliable horse to carry you along as you buy more of the same one. Slowly climbing the same ladder with no risk.\n2) Buy from the junk yard. Find incredible deals and eliminate everyone insta-fast with no real difficulty or risks.\n\nThe game doesn't play out any differently. I wish there would be more to routes and business decisions. Being able to have a ton of departures from one airport in the exact same moment as well.... c'mon, really?\n\nDidn't they have that RIGHT in the first game with finite gate space?\n\nImagine your airline starting at a very small FBO with small operations and as your airline grows, invest your revenue into your airport as well, slowly growing it up and butting up against more more competition, with decision making AI. That's what you'd hope for in the modern sequal to such a great game. Again, swing and total miss. It's the re-hash of the first game with elements removed.\n\nCargo is a purchased add-on which does little more than offer a way for you to make money even faster.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, tycoon game that challenges you even a little bit to try new things, this isn't it. I'm hoping there is a 3, and I'm hoping they try, instead of beating a dead horse that by luck, spat up some money.","July 6, 2015","false","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can change out parts but its sometimes hard to tell if that super expensive new wing design is worth the price tag as you don't see much in the way of radical stat changes. Passenger capacity can be changed but even in the largest plane you'll feel like there should be more seats.\n\nAll of this is topped off by the fact that the planes are not surprisingly hyper cartoony with closer relations to the Stay Puff marshmellow man of Ghostbusters fame, the Michelin man, or a Airbus Beluga. You stop caring early on about paint jobs and logos because of this.\n\nAnother major gameplay issue is hiring staff feels like a massive chore rather then a quick formality as you have to assign  manually all your staff and if you want a fully staffed plane its at least a 2 day ordeal because only a handful of staff ever apply at one time.\n\nMoving around the airport is at least simular to the old game to a point but you'll be using the hot keys to skip all the walking in short order, as the layout of the airport can be hard to follow because for example the used plane dealer (junkyard in this case) is simply a tiny door in the back of the new plane retailers shop.\n\nThe sole good things that I have found in this game are in making routes you can set aside time for maintenance and I found some of the characters at least somewhat entertaining namely the tutorial guy with some of this references and the Airport Manager who is literally the Godfather.\n\nEven with a steep Steam sale 80-90% off this game just isn't worth the time, money, or hard drive space especially when you can get the original game on Steam as well likely for less to boot.","March 23","false","14.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The basics of the game boils down to choosing from pre-designed planes, fitting them with pre-designed interior, staffing them and then setting up flight schedules.\n\nThe majority of the game is spent speeding up time waiting for your flights to occur and then assessing them afterwards. Although the game has potential, it does not have much depth or challenge. I got bored with it quite quickly.\n\nThe general look and feel of the game might appeal to a younger audience, which can be tied in with its simplistic gameplay.\n\nPersonally I think elements like managing the airport itself, designing runways, managing flights etc would have been more interesting.","January 8","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have played it and tried hard to like it. I just can't. I wanted to enjoy playing Airline Tycoon 2 so much, but it was a swing and a miss. The Freemode is lackluster which is what you play after beating the rest a few times over. Free mode should offer a challenge that varies game by game based on the AI... The game is pretty much a rinse and repeat of 1 of 2 strategy choices.\n\n1) Buy a brand new, reliable plane, keep chugging along and slowly take over your enemies knowing you have your reliable horse to carry you along as you buy more of the same one. Slowly climbing the same ladder with no risk.\n2) Buy from the junk yard. Find incredible deals and eliminate everyone insta-fast with no real difficulty or risks.\n\nThe game doesn't play out any differently. I wish there would be more to routes and business decisions. Being able to have a ton of departures from one airport in the exact same moment as well.... c'mon, really?\n\nDidn't they have that RIGHT in the first game with finite gate space?\n\nImagine your airline starting at a very small FBO with small operations and as your airline grows, invest your revenue into your airport as well, slowly growing it up and butting up against more more competition, with decision making AI. That's what you'd hope for in the modern sequal to such a great game. Again, swing and total miss. It's the re-hash of the first game with elements removed.\n\nCargo is a purchased add-on which does little more than offer a way for you to make money even faster.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun, tycoon game that challenges you even a little bit to try new things, this isn't it. I'm hoping there is a 3, and I'm hoping they try, instead of beating a dead horse that by luck, spat up some money.","July 6, 2015","false","33.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More airports (including the one five miles from my house in the suburbs of Seattle!), a deceptively deep plane customization system, and a good bit of the charm of the first game carried over in the cartoony graphics.\n\nBuuuut...there's simply not enough here to recommend it for the price they're asking, and the DLC is downright exploitive (no shock from publisher Kalypso, which pulls the same crap with every other game they publish---Tropico 4 and 5, looking at you.)  If you can get it on sale for dirt cheap (like, 80% off/under $4 US) cheap, then _maybe_, but really, even then there are just too many other, better games, including this game's own predecessor, available on Steam.\n\nIt's a 5 on its own merits, with a two-point penalty for the poor value for the price.\n\n3/10","July 15, 2015","false","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
