The animations are "off" if you ask me but i hope this aspect gets some attention during the early access stage.\nThere are no checkpoints which i found, so if you mess-up and die you get punished for it and have to begin from the start of the mission. I detest the current hand-holding trend so this is a big plus for me.\nThe camera did play a few tricks on me but considering this is early access i expect this to be resolved by launch. Camera can always be tricky in these top-down games....not my favorite.\nI do hope they add more levels, more objectives and a much larger variety of enemies to fight, the monkeys do get boring after a short while.\n\nIn my opinion it looks decent for a Early Access Tittle, much better then many others that come along asking much higher prices.\nI did not run into any game-breaking bugs, just a slight pop-in here and a slight stutter there.\nI did not play a ton of the game so take all information given here with a grain of salt and as always judge for yourselves if this tittle is worth your time and money.\n\nFor a clearer view you can watch my first impressions video for Congo :\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXw45lz4MD8&index=1&list=PLPu1MBLqtny7rnijEzJ3bPSEMepog_rOK","November 27, 2014","true","1.0"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","21","27","2","0"

You keep hearing noises coming from the bush and the foliage is cracking everywhere you look around. All you have going for you is a torch in one hand and a machete in the other hand!\n\nCongo is an action/survival game where you can play by yourself, but it’s primary aim to play on a co-op basis with up to 3 of your mates. You will be able to play in two type of mods; defence or objective. The defence mod currently has 8 different locations and the aim is to make sure you do not lose your radio transmitter and to stay alive as long as you can. For the objective mod, well I guess you can figure this one out. Whatever you prefer to play, you will have to explore the jungle to find additional weapons, gizmos and tools either in crates or on the ground. You will always start with your machete but crates will get you access to revolvers, machines and submachine guns, shotgun, carabines and of course a limited amount of ammunition. Just a little tip for you, make sure you collect as many knives as you can. You will be pinned down to the ground by one of these demons and the only way to kill them went they are on top of you is to use a knife. Gps, flares (which scare the demons), fuel can, cutters and revive syringes (you can’t revive yourself, so this is only if you play as a party) are pretty much your gizmos and tools.\n\nThe A.I. is actually very good, demons (Congolese Apes) will sneak around, move away if you flash them with light or use a flare on the ground and attack you at a prominent time for them. The atmosphere is genuinely scary and I really like the fog of war type of setup where you only see clearly around your character(s) which amplify the fear aspect of the game.\n\nFrom the controls point of view and combat system, they are easy to use but I must admit that I would like to see an easy way to use items in the inventory. The graphics are good and polished.\n\nCongo is an early access game and show great potential, worth giving it a go!\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Scary atmosphere\n-	Great A.I.\n-	Polished graphics\n-	Achievements\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	Items in the inventory should be friendlier to use\n-	No trading cards\n\n7.5/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

What feels like a tribute to the movie, this game goes way beyond that. The atmosphere feels great. The controls, aiming, and weaponry are all very intuitive. The way lighting plays a huge factor in the game is a really nice touch, something I have wanted to see done right in a game for over a decade. That being said, the game is still very much a work in progress and the content provided at release was minimal. I am sure there is a whole lot more to come as it appears there will be multiple maps, as indicated by the lobby screen, and that probably means a variety of objectives in the long run.\n\nSo right now, is it worth buying the Early Access for the price of 9.99? Yes. I do recommend however that you coerce at least one friend to buy it as well to play with as there is no in-game communication, of any kind, at this stage.","November 27, 2014","true","3.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

It's a top-down adventure/horror co-op survival game. You (and your "friends") find yourself in the middle of a jungle at night, with bloodthirsty, gorilla looking demons, lurking and growling in the shadows. There is no health bars or anything, if you get jumped, your done ... so get a couple friends, that can resurrect you, if needed, and get the party started!\nThere are 3 kind of ammo you gather in the jungle and quite a few weapons to use it with -  there are no names, but you can recognize your standard AK-47 , SMG, pistol and shotgun. Some weapons you can use with one hand, while holding your torch, other weapons have a flashlight on them. When you open a weapon box, the weapons kinda fly out of it, sometimes to an unreachable place, sometimes right into the hands of your friends, so be positioned and ready to snatch them fast ;) You always have your trusty machete with you from the start, in case that you prefer some hand to hand combat - it chops down demons quite effectively. There are some other goodies spread around the map as well - the revive "needle", a compass ( I have not found a map yet) to somewhat help you with orientation. The pliers and fuel canisters you need for the mission are also randomly scattered around. While carrying the canister, you're defenseless and die in one hit ( or well one "jump up" ), so co-op is highly recommended to ease the situation, as dropping the canister to pull out your weapon sometimes cannot be done fast enough!\nThe game uses Unreal engine, the graphics are OK, nothing special, but get the job done. The dense vegetation sometimes get in the way of your overhead camera, so using the road is always better. The lighting effects from the torch and the flashlight are reasonable.\nI've only encountered one type of enemy so far - the bloodthirsty gorilla demons, that are not always the brightest, but definitely can be sneaky and keep you on your toes. The fighting / shooting mechanics / animations could be better, but it's not terrible in any stretch of the imagination, and get the job done. There is no music, and frankly I haven't noticed the need for it - the crickets in the background and the subtle growling from the demons, are atmospheric enough ;) The sounds effects are reasonable as well, nothing special and nothing to complain about.\nAll in all, even in this early access the game is working as expected and is an enjoyable experience (especially in co-op :p)\n\nTL:DR you can check my solo gameplay video and get an overview of the game, (co-op videos will be coming soon™)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=347528874\n","November 27, 2014","true","2.3"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

If ANYTHING changes, my review will change. EVERYTHING in my review will be consistent with my time played.\n\nPros:\n- Play in the setting of my favorite movie when I was a kid: Congo.\n- Has a horror feel to it with it's dark lighting and fog hiding the primates as they stalk you.\n- AI is mostly good, hit and run guerilla (hehe) tactics when the primates numbers are thin and the fog is thick, and overwhelming group charges when they are in large numbers.\n\nCons:\n- Overall the game is very clunky.\n- The characters controls poorly, and the controls themselves feel unresponsive at times.\n- Gun's aim system is clunky and leaves much to be desired.\n- Drop a fuel tank and watch it fly like a bird you just set free.\n- Melee combat is clunky and the melee strikes don't always work how they should, and sometimes don't make sense (strike with ape in face and nothing happens, strike with ape 2 meters away and it dies)\n- Players are greedy and don't communicate (play with no pistol takes all the pistol ammo and wont share, if you're knocked down and dropped your weapon your "friends" in your group will steal the weapon until they run out of ammo)\n- By far the worst part of the game is the performance. I play on a high end gaming PC and enjoy smooth plays of games like GTA V, The Division, Total War, Elite: Dangerous, Squad, Dying Light, Just Cause 3, and other graphics intensive games. This game gets the worst framerates of any game I have ever played since I built this PC in Sept 2015.\n\nFirst impressions are everything, and my first impressions are that this is an unfinished and unrefined early access money grab. Will my opinion change after spending more time ingame? I doubt it. It's not something that I just nit picked, I really wanted to like this game an dhave been waiting for the full release for a while now to finally play it. For the sake of all the hopes i had for it Im going to FORCE myself to play it further. I'll update my review if anything changes.","March 22","false","0.7"," 18 of 30 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","18","30","3","2"

Single player is like playing Permadeath, so it is ill advised, although MIGHT suggest room for some AI? Even one...\n\nThe enemies arrive in heavier hordes the further you progress, which means that the tension builds constantly, allowing you no room to relax, or feel comfortable even with your friends and 2 hands full of weaponry!\n\nSome "Early Access" issues are present. I've gotten stuck in some corners where a simple jump would get me out, not that I think jumping should be implimented... and the foliage while thick and organic, can block the camera at times which is disorientating and quite stressful when you know there's a threat in the area!\n\nLooking forward to getting more people together to trial it with 4 players, but so far, I keep wanting to go back to Congo!","November 27, 2014","true","6.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","1"

The tension is immediate, the danger, even when yet manifested, instantly palpable. You barely see as far as where your modest torch - probably your best friend early in the game - will generously shed light on. Not of a lot of games offer a distinct advantage in wielding a gun over a 2-handed-firearm, as you can still hold the handmade 360-degrees beacon to spot foes (relatively) early on. And let me add that you start with just a big knife.\n\nThe enemy is intelligent, powerful, stealthy. Most of the time 1st contact starts with the sound of the enemy carefully brushing the vegetation, and still you have to rely on you best aurality to pinpoint exactly where the threat is approaching from. It knows how and when to attack, when to retreat for a renewed or flanked offensive, and it uses the element of surprise and teamwork to stalk and hit the invader - you, who is in the end of the day only trying to haul out of this sinister place of a jungle by night.\n\nCongo is a game about pure survival from a place where every second takes a toll on your nerves, and a place where rushing blindly and pseudo-merrily will put your stride to an abrupt and violent end.  A game still in development despite its "as is" robustness, but already showing great promise and a rather terrifying presence not often approached or executed as deftly.\n\nThe YES-Factor : sale or no sale, definitely worth going for.\nNO Gamesman Land : can be bad for cardiovasculars (seriously) .\n\n\n","May 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

Don't buy it.\n\nOnce you realize every strike and kill is the same and so is every enemy (Two enemies. Such variety!) there is little else to do but complete the objectives that, without satisfying gameplay, are left feeling pretty tedious.\n\nInventory and item system is really bad. Loot crates will "pop" open and throw your stuff into unreachable areas. Travelling across the maps is very convoluted, and represents the greatest part of the games difficulty.\n\nThere is virtually no story. The scary atmosphere will wear off very quickly as well. Sound seems to be centered on crackling bushes. Demons (sloths) are everywhere, so there is endless crackling from their trips in and out of the bushes.\n\nMy old review stated that this game could be good in time. Time has passed, it didn't work out for this game.\n\nDon't buy this. Even if you have 3 friends to play with.\n\nDemons still look like sloths.\n\nedit : My play time is low.

Considering the release for what it is, Congo shows promise.  (Also I really don't recommending getting this game by yourself. Honestly, it should have 2-pack and 4-pack options (which isn't present as of this review), because playing by yourself really isn't the best option nor will it give you a good experience with the game.\n\nThe Good Stuff:\nUnreal engine game: Visually speaking, the game doesn't look like it's in alpha\nIsometric Survival (The angle can be a little bit too acute at times\nSounds effects are truly impressive.  The gunshots and how those sounds travel through the jungle is great!\nThe Bad Stuff:\n\nBuggy. I got hit when my inventory was open and could no longer access the inventory. Also I got stuck in the environment.\nDefinetly take a look at my video to get a better idea of what the game is like.  I honestly could list more bad stuff, but I feel it's a bit premature to talk about them because they could be updated at any point.\n\nRight now, the game is very hardcore.  No maps, no guidance.

Which is boring as hell. Please advertise this game more.\n\nI see I'm getting a lot of downvotes here so I'll explain more. I only got to play the single player portion of the game and from what I've played, it SUCKS. For all I know, the multiplayer portion is amazing but I don't since there are no people online. Either remove the single player or get some more people to play the game.","January 18, 2015","false","0.1"," 11 of 37 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","11","37","0","4"

"How to survive" is way better than this. And "Congo" devs got a load of work ahead of them to make this any good.","December 4, 2014","false","0.9"," 7 of 35 people (20%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","20","7","35","2","2"

I wanted to like this game, but the lack of depth and content made this go stale quick.  The melee combat is possibly the worst I've ever experienced with hits registering late and both myself & the enemy going down.  My melee swings leaving a "cloud" of death where any monsters running into the area magically die....\n\nbleh.\n\nSave yourself some money.","March 27","false","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
