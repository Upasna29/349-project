Very pleased for it to be released on PC - what we have all been waiting for! Graphics are much improved over previous titles, and the gameplay is as good as its ever been. I've seen and heard many people commenting about the slow speed of the wrestling, personally I don't see the problem at all. Its a lot more realistic, and with the stamina mode (unless you disable it) it makes sure you can't run around like a meat-head on steroids without sacrificing lots of energy.\n\nI've played over 80 hours of this now and I still have a small bit left to do, so I've got my moneys worth for sure. Again, other criticisms I've seen was focused on the lack of depth for the game - which I don't understand. Story Mode, WWE Universe Mode, 2K Showcase & Multiplayer have kept me thoroughly entertained throughout. I had to stop and start my Story Mode numerous times though as it did get extremely repetitive, notably through the lack of cut scene storylines/challenges. It is very "basic" only offering a handful of times where it really did show some great potential. It does become repetitive, but if this is your first time with the game then it won't be as big a problem for you - I owned this on PS4 before getting it on PC so I've already completed everything the game has to offer, this is just a re-run for me. Expect the Story to last roughly 12-20 hours.\n\nNice to see the community creations progressively getting better and better, the ease of applying created costumes to stock characters is a great bonus - therefore you can always keep your roster wardrobe up to date, so long as the community has created them!\n\nIt does come with some glitches, the most common of which was the ring ropes "disappearing", and sometimes when I finished a match and it went through the highlights - it would just be all the characters in the ring on the floor like ragdolls with the crowd pulling some really strange illuminate-esque poses. But honestly I couldn't really give a ♥♥♥♥, and if it were the case all I needed to do was restart my game to fix the problem.\n\nIts beautiful, its entertaining and its filled with potential to finally fulfill future PC releases of WWE, lets hope 2K make it happen. This will stay installed in my library for some time. After all, we all get those moments where we want to beat up Seth Rollins, right?","May 22, 2015","true","124.4"," 209 of 234 people (89%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","89","209","234","25","2"

Also here is a link to the official 2k15 pc forums specifically for mods: http://forums.2k.com/forumdisplay.php?606-WWE-2K15-(PC)-Mods-Discussion\n\nMy review:\n\nI've played WWE 2K15 first on the Xbox 360 and then on the Playstation 4. The reason I bought this for the PC is because I'm looking forward to mods.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nHonestly, the graphics on next gen consoles were a huge improvement over WWE 2K14 and the PC just gives us that full HD 60fps movement. So far I've only experienced one glitch in the replay of the highlights. But I'm sure this will be fixed in time. The character models are far more realistic than the older WWE versions. I only feel like the ramp and outside of the ring could somehow be improved graphically as well as the general arena. I've created my own superstar and played about 7 matches in NXT. I haven't experienced any glitches yet during My Career.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nCan't say anything negative about the gameplay. I initially expected I would be using a gamepad to play the game but I actually think I might stick with the old keyboard. The mouse isn't actually used. WASD to move around, F to reverse, Q to pick ♥♥♥♥ up and the arrow keys are used to fight. Left key strikes, up key uses your signature/finishing move, down key is grappling and the right key is the old irish whip.\n\nLoading times: 11/10\nThe loading times are very fast for me. When I turn entrances off and hit enter to go to a match I'm supplexing John Cena within 10 seconds. I'll list my specs at the bottom.\n\nMusic: 8/10\nThe only reason I'm giving this an 8 instead of a 10 is because I've heard these songs hundreds of times and probably memorised them by now. It's a good soundtrack but there's not a lot of songs and they will tire eventually. You obviously have the option to turn the music (or just certain songs) off.\n\nNegative points:\n- No Paige\nThey won't be releasing Paige for the PC any time soon. She was a season pass exclusive for consoles, but since there's no season pass for PC she isn't being released (yet?).\n\n- Not as much customization as previous WWE games\nBasically you can't create diva's, which sucks as there aren't many in the game inititally. You also can't create arena's, titles or finishers like previous games. The entrance creation is limited with existing superstars entrances and only a few custom options.\n\n- Not all the DLC is available yet.\n\nIf you enjoy WWE and like the look of the gameplay on YouTube etc I recommend you get this. If you only want this for mods then you should probably wait untill people have figured out how to mod the game and there actually are mods out.\n\nMy specs:\nCPU: Intel Core i7-4770K CPU @ 3.50GHZ (not overclocked)\nGPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 770\nRam: 16GB\nWindows 8.1\nResolution: 1920 x 1080, 60HZ","April 28, 2015","true","12.6"," 171 of 220 people (78%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","78","171","220","10","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KadeStorm/recommended/240460/","KadeStorm","Kade Storm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KadeStorm/","1320 products in account","Summary: *It's rather pointless to force people to pick between 'recommend' and 'not recommend'. In the end, despite issues, one could still recommend this title -- with the hope that many of its issues are addressed eventually -- but there are some real concerns that need highlighting.* This review is subject to revisions, and even a shift in recommendation.\n\nIt is understandable --  and to be expected -- that wrestling fans are going to react to this title with a certain bias. Multiple console generations have passed since the PC has had a mainstream wrestling title from the WWE, so the enthusiasm and naive view that it must be 'great' can be excused to a degree. The problem is that many, but not all, of the positive reviews are blatantly overlooking the technical issues and flaws within this game, so this won't be an overall review as it will be an actual overview of the shortcomings that are inherent in this title. These flaws range from actual in-game bugs, to overall game stability, the general uncertainty about the so-called 'included DLCs' (although these can be expected to appear sooner than later given other published claims) the criticisms about lesser options than previous titles, and frame rate issues that do not correlate with the actual recommended system requirements for this title.\n\nGoing through the problems in more detail, and these have been verified by other accounts of the game:\n\n- First off, the game has its bugs. From visual glitches and random artefacts like ropes disappearing and reappearing half-way in the middle of the ring, to bodies cliping into the ring as well as the ringside. And no, deactivating FXAA doesn't help. One could actually go on to experience and list more but that would simply be repeating a fundamental issue that a title being released this late as a port should be looking to avoid. If there is one thing the positive reviews do speak to, it is fan/gamer expectation and 2K games is not off to the most graceful of starts, but such is the case in an era where many hopeful titles are coming out as glitchy works in progress on release date.\n\n- Secondly, there is a serious issue with random crashes. It really cannot be excused and arguments from the positive-reviewers about this being an 'isolated issue' is disingenuous at best. One could say that their experience with stability is an isolated experience, but that would be sinking the argument to the levels of their bias. Fact remains that for a sizeable number of people who have paid for this title, the experience with basic game stability is coming up short and this needs to be addressed. Positive reviewers in denial of this can remain in denial but that doesn't mean that their out of touch with reality views actually negate the problem for the consumer base. Again, 2K needs to get on top of this issue.\n\n- The general uncertainty about all the included DLC is more of a minor issue. Since it isn't absolutely clear when this DLC is meant to appear -- we are already approaching the end of spring -- confusion can arise, but one can certainly hope that the consumers can unite on this matter and expect that 2K delivers this content soon, or at least that it offers a more definitive idea of when this content can be expected.\n\n- This takes us to the general issue with the overall quality of this game as a product of the WWE video game franchise. Just because the PC has finally received some modicum of acknowledgement after being ignored for over a decade as a viable gaming platform by games publishers and developers working on WWE titles, doesn't mean that PC gamers should actually drop their standards. It's rather unsettling to watch all the positive reviews float in without a sense of self-awareness when even the next generation console rendition of this title has received plenty of valid criticism. PC gamers should have respectable representation with respectable standards. Fact remains that across the board, the 2K15 title -- despite a hefty graphics engine upgrade -- has undergone an even heftier customisation and broad playability downgrade. It is beyond dispute, and a matter of consensus (has been since this game was released last year on all consoles), that WWE 2K15 is a parred back experience in terms of feature, content and customisation options when compared to earlier entries. Many fans on the current generation have expressed dissatisfaction with this approach. PC gamers, while late to this experience, should not let their desperation and lack of acknowledgement get in the way of valid criticism: they should expect the same as their console counterparts and expect better from 2K games. This title, in terms of feature quality -- for this generation -- is actually verging on being mediocre, and this fact needs to be acknowledged rather than glossed over with the noisy desperation of wrestling devotees in denial. This is actually a rather anaemic, stripped-down title that happens to look great.\n\n- Last, but not least -- probably one of the more important points -- we deal with the recommended system specifications and frame rate issues. Let's not mince words here, this game does erratically switch back and forth on the frame rate spectrum and this can be verified with simple software along with basic observation. It states, clear as day, that the recommended specificatin is an Nvidia GTX 570 or an upper-end Radeon 6 series card. On that note, one can utterly disregard the elitist ramblings of the reviewer with the GTX 780, telling others that the game is 'fine' and they should upgrade their specification. This kind of commentary is utter nonsense at best, and likely spam at worst. It is absolutely beside the point if one has a much better card than recommended specification, and is able to get better frame rates out of a title as a result -- a performance that should be attainable on an older card. In this case, the game is advertising itself with a recommendation of the GTX 570 or equivalent, which should be able to provide quality performance across the board, and this just isn't the case. In fact, it is reasonable to speculate that the performance is inconsistent even with faster cards, as there seems to be some kind of system in the game where the frame rate switches between 30 FPS, 45 FPS and 60 FPS depending on what is taking place on the screen. For example: It generally tends to slow down when the camera zooms in on 'finishers' taking place, but perhaps this was an intended feature and part of the game's cinematography and art direction. The same can be said about certain entrances and other moments within the game. This matter needs to be addressed and they do need to work on making the frame rate output consistent as this title is a direct port of the version published on the current generation of consoles, which has also had trouble keeping up with 60 FPS.\n\nAt the end of the day, the fact that this game is now available on PC should probably be considered a good thing and a positive sign of the times. PC gamers have been excluded from wrestling titles for too long. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean that they should lower their standards and overlook the seriously obvious shortcomings of this title. PC gamers, regardless of their enjoyment of the wrestling entertainment industry, really need to get real on this issue and curb their enthusiasm for a moment to favour the task of holding developers up to basic standard. As has been discussed in detail, this game has its flaws from actual bugs, stability issues, to a somewhat uninspiring game design, none of this being helped by inconsistent performance that doesn't correlate with recommended system specification, although that could change. Wrestling fandom desperation or not, the dissatisfaction with these issues absolutely needs to be appreciated and the issues themselves, addressed to reasonable satisfaction.","April 28, 2015","false","28.6"," 415 of 588 people (71%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","71","415","588","33","27"

If you liked WWE 2k14 and other older releases of WWE games you will not like this game because it's more realistic simulation of WWE rather than casual fighting game.\n\nMy Career mode is very lacking content. Most of times youre fighting random matches without any kind of rivalry. There are only a couple of rivalries in the whole career mode. When you win WWE championship that's it, game over. Because of that I tried not winning championship and get as many rivalries as possible, sadly at the end you are gonna only get championship rivalries no matter which PPV you choose (Every year you can choose in which 3 PPV's you want to participate). Not only that, my career is extremely easy, I easily fought my way to WWE championship without losing a single match. There is no difficulty option. If you are buying this only for my career mode, dont buy.\n\nUniverse mode is fun, you can make your own WWE universe with your own rivalries, tag teams, champions and etc. There are a lot of rivalries too you can play.\n\n2K showcase is basically storylines that happened in WWE.

The short of it is that everything I loved is gone leaving an incredibly empty game.\n\nI first head to the customisation to find you can't create a Diva, only edit the clothing of a current one, and the body morphing options from both sides of the extreme are kept to realistic standards... why? I don't see what was wrong with making some extreme lard belly or a rake- it was part of the fun. The hairstyles are more or less a template of current WWE superstars and there is barely more than 10 of them so you'll be loving your Cena clones. Masks? There's around 5 and they all look crap. You can't wear some items into the ring such as hats etc which blows my mind. I've never seen such limited character creation in a WWE game.\n\nThe gameplay is so bloody stagnant and 'fake'. It's got such a focus on looking good that the developers seem to have forgotten that the fun in wrestling was watching all these crazy moves and finishers, people flying out of the ring and all their little gimmicks. But I really felt I was stuck doing the same two or three moves in a really clunky fight-system. The reversal is a joke where the 'RT' warning pops up and I hit it..."too fast"? If I see this guy's ♥♥♥♥ing boot heading to my face you'd think I'd rather be out of the way sooner than later. The grappling system seemed interesting until it came to 'rock, paper, scissors' with the result often being that myself and the AI picked the same one so the ♥♥♥♥ just cancelled out, after this happened twice the grapple ended. It wasn't fun. The camera angle stays the same pretty much all of the time, it used to be fairly cinematic with each move moving around and giving you a different view, adding to the stagnation and lack of entertainment in the fights.\n\nMy Career looked frustrating and empty, you start off in wrestling school and the damn coach there just won't shut up. He keeps telling me to act like I want to be here-I don't. I want to start actual wrestling like you used to in the story modes instead of him telling me that pinning my opponent is a good way to win a match.\n\nWWE Universe was supposed to be a hard hitting point of this game, I don't see it. It looks just like many of the ones that came before it where you stuff wrestlers into matches against each other and a rivalry can come out of it. So yes, we had this before, but we also had custom wrestlers, federations and so on to make that more interesting and really do your own thing. I can't be arsed watching half these wrestling AI battle it out in really unenergetic and slow combat (an odd way to depict a wrestling match).\n\nThe soundtrack? Jesus Christ. First thing I did was go to the options and turn off 80% of the soundtrack and even then it still sucked. The music is from generic mainstream bands like Rise Against and seemingly not many songs play at all. I kept hearing the same song multiple times in a very short time-span and none of them got me pumped up; rather, I'd felt like I had just tuned in to some commercial break for a livestream. What happened to the nu-metal, rock or energetic rap? I do not exaggurate when I say this was the worst soundtrack I have ever heard in a video game.\n\nIn summary, I asked for a refund. The gameplay is boring, slow and repetitive. The creative modes lack any good content so the game overall feels incredibly empty- I bought it on sale and I still don't think it was worth the price. They need to go back and learn lessons from their old games, so boring.","June 16, 2015","false","1.1"," 227 of 329 people (69%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","69","227","329","23","15"

My manager (Sensational Sherri) smartly distracted the ref as Hogan made the cover, so I had a whole 10 seconds to get my escape marker in my 'pin escape' zone. And I discovered... I couldn't. You hold a button to fill the bar, but it goes up in increments. The two possible escape marker placements I could hit were on either side of the pin escape zone. I had been covered by the impossible pin; I lost.\n\nTaker vs Lesnar - Recreating the WM match, it was awesome and 'realistic'. I kicked out of the last ride, he kicked out of the F5, I reversed the Tombstone. An epic, brutal, long match back and forth. I took it to the outside, Taker threw me into the turnbuckle post and got back in. I got up to my feet at 9 (how dramatic!) and ran to the ring... and Brock wouldn't get in, just spazzing out next to the ring. Ref counted 10, the Taker/Lesnar WM XXX match ends in count out. Because the game won't let you get back in unless you're inbetween two invisible barriers. The instant rematch was just a generic WWE 2K15 match; the moment was gone. Thanks game.\n-------------\n\nThis sums it up because, as you can see, the potential is now there for an amazing simulation and experience, but it doesn't achieve it due to stupidity and laziness mostly.\n\nEveryone rejoiced when the series was finally removed from the cold, dead, lazy fingers of THQ and Yukes. The intention is clearly there from 2K to bring it back to its peak of around 2006. But on the other hand, so much has been removed through the years that this edition is basically half a 'Smackdown vs Raw 2007'. Plus, I worry about the integrity of a company that finishes some content before release THEN removes it and charges extra for it (on consoles) as DLC. Leaving you with half a game mode as default unless you shell out more (though PC gets it free).\n\nLet's not even get into the slowdown, intentional(!) blurriness and bugs.\n\nThe game's still good for enjoying the historic game mode (called '2K Showcase' now), just as with Attitude Era and the WrestleMania history in WWE 13 and 2K14. However, nothing else is worth playing. Career mode is a load of singles 'dark' matches, and when you finally win the title after 4 game years, a screen comes up saying '...after winning the WWE title, you went on to have an illustrious career for 15 years, then retired. GAME OVER.'\n\nTo top it off, it's said by your boss Triple H. The guy who's been ruining careers for a couple of decades now. Awesomely fitting.\n\nThat literally happens. It's not from The Simpsons, it's not satire, THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENS.\n\nNow you see why you should be worried about the people making this game. They either thought this made sense, or they couldn't be bothered to finish it. THQ have been ousted by a coup, but it turns out our new 2K rulers are just as crooked as the despot they just executed.\n\nUniverse mode continues to be repetitive and meaningless. There needs to be interactivity, it needs to be less of a cluster-♥♥♥♥, and it needs to be more accessible and friendlier. It needs storylines, not a bunch of matches with the odd non-interactive cutscene of Bloke A beating up Bloke B for 4 weeks, with Mark Henry wrestling 3 times a show because he has 3 costumes or versions of himself.\n\nIt appears the problem with WWE games is the same problem with WWE itself: when you have no competition, why bother? You can half-♥♥♥ it and make about as much money than if you had put the work in and made an 8, 9, 10/10 game.","August 15, 2015","false","55.3"," 105 of 144 people (73%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","73","105","144","16","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyborg2040/recommended/240460/","cyborg2040","cyborg2040","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyborg2040/","290 products in account","Ok here is my bullet point review for WWE 2k15\n\nGameplay\n\nThis game plays similar to the last few WWE games on consoles. One button attacks, one grapples. R trigger (on game pads) will block, holding a direction with a grapple or punch will change the move that you do. Nothing outside of the wrestling game controls standards here.\n\nThe difference to the gameplay in this game as compared to WWE 13 or 14 is really all in the move animations. While you may pull all of the moves off the same way that you have for the last few years, they are all animated differently. So much so that it does in fact make this appear to be a completely different game at first glance.\n\nThe new animations are both a blessing and a curse. While 2K have done a pretty amazing job and making the action on your monitor look very close to the action on your television every Monday night, they have done so by bringing back a few gameplay elements that their predecessor had already tried out and removed from the game for good reason.\n\nFirst prematch mini games. These were brought in by THQ is the early days of the Smackdown vs. RAW series. Back then the mini game was only your opening move and while some liked the idea, the majority cried foul. It didn't take THQ long to remove the mini games from the WWE games. So why did 2K not only decide that it was a good idea to bring this concept back, but to make you have to play these mini games for your first 5 to 10 moves?\n\nGranted this time the mini games open the match with a series of chain wrestling moves that mimic what you would see on TV, but the problem is most people don't want to play them. Imagine, you and a friend select your fighters. You pick your match type, you're ready to lay the smackdown on your chums candy ♥♥♥ and then, oh wait mini game chain wrestling!\n\nThe next item that 2K brought back to the series is hitting a button to perform a move and then watching a 5 to 10 second series of animations. sometimes it can feel so bad that you may think that you are playing a QTE game. One example is a character that has a series of kicks as his signature move (YES!) Prepare to sit back and watch each and every one of those kicks play out with just a single button press. The other problem lies in the repositioning of the wrestlers. Seriously, when I decide to lock in the Scorpion Deathlock near the ropes, I shouldn't have to watch Sting grab the opponent and move him to the center of the ring, casually walk around him, and then finally apply the move. I can only assume that this feature was put in to try and avoid clipping with the new animations.\n\nThe problem however is this. First if I apply a submission near the ropes I am going to get a rope break called (in a standard match). This is an error on my part and I should pay for it, just like the wrestlers do every week on RAW. The other problem is that this stuff really snaps you out of the game. I hate to beat a dead horse, but look to No Mercy or Here Comes the Pain. Both games did a good job of sucking you into their world. There was no time to stare out the window while playing those games. If you looked away for even a moment it could turn the tide of the match. With WWE 2k15 just set up a 619 and go make a sandwich. (Results will vary)\n\nTo sum up gameplay, even with the problems I pointed out the game is still pretty damn fun to play. You may get annoyed at it from time to time, but you should realize that 2K have built a solid engine here, and it is a great foundation to build the game from. No Mercy came from WCW vs. the World, and Smackdown Here Comes the Pain came from Smackdown 1. So long as 2K continues tweak the game engine with each release we should end up with a great game as soon as 2016.\n\nCreation\n\nOk Create an everything is gone except for the following.\n\nWrestlers (male only)\n\nEntrances\n\nmovesets\n\nThat's it, that's all you've got. How is it you ask?\n\nCreate a Wrestler\n\nYou have limited morphing of both the body and face. You have far less parts to use compared to previous games. You have less than 20 hair styles. This game is not designed for you to make a perfect clone of AJ Styles or The Great Muta. Nope this game is made for you to make an original wrestler and go through career. Then maybe use the other 24 slots for alt attires to the in game roster. Oh yeah 25 slots is your limit.\n\nConsoles have 500gb hard drives now. PCs can have as much storage as the user is willing to buy, but they could only give us 25 slots for wrestlers because, "~the grapix are so good that the new consoles just can't handle more that 25 of our ultra realistic looking custom wrestlers" (That don't look much better than 2k14 FYI)\n\nLet's get real for a second 2K. The wrestlers are stored as code and tells the game what parts, colors and slider settings to use. We are not rendering a full model and saving it to our drives every time we create a wrestler. Your excuse is lazy, and it only works on the ill informed. Just like when THQ use to say that they couldn't give us more than 32 CAW slots because they didn't have space on the disc. Ignoring the fact that disc space is a non issue for a line or two of code. WWE games were often shipped out with a GB or two unused.\n\nEntrances\n\nNope... You will not like it. You can use the entrance parts of SOME of the roster, but not all of them. 2K were kind enough to give us mostly entrance moves like Goldust and Fandango, who really can't be used for other guys. Considering that there is also no custom music (outside of a mod work around) I suggest just skipping entrances. Don't make them, don't watch them. Moving on...\n\nMovesets\n\nNothing has changed here other than the abilities feature. Basically the abilities work as follows. You want to do top rope moves? Select the ability. You want to do suicide dives? Select the ability. So since he doesn't have the top rope ability the Big Show will go to the second rope for an elbow. Ok got it!\n\nShowcase Mode\n\nThis is 30 Years of Wrestlemania mode from 2k14, just only as a few select feuds. CM Punk vs. John Cena and Shawn Michaels vs. Triple H are the two that come stock with the game. You will wrestle the key matches from these feuds, while trying to hit the key moves that were hit in the real life matches. You do all of this to take a trip down memory lane and unlock a million alt attires and arenas.\n\nUniverse is pretty much what it has always been. Computer selected exhibition matches with a few cut scenes thrown into the mix to give the impression that this is more than random matches.\n\nCareer mode is fun until you realize that it's just a grind to (SPOILER ALERT ***** STOP READING) win the WWE Title, and then the mode fast forward to your retirement match. I hope they continue to work on this mode and get it to the point that it is more like the season modes from Smackdown : Shut Your Mouth and Here Comes the Pain.\n\nConclusion\n\nI realize that I was short with some of the modes, but I'm not a professional writer, and I was getting bored  and honestly most people who even read this review will skip to this part anyhow.\n\nThis is the best WWE game on PC in over a decade and you can take that to the bank! I'm surprised that 2K didn't use that line in the advertising for this game. Of course to do that they would have had to advertise the release. The game is fun though and if you like WWE you will like this game. If you kinda sorta think WWE is ok, but prefer other wrestling like ROH or Japan you will not like this game as much.\n\nBut the game is fun to play and at the end of the day that's what matters right?","May 3, 2015","true","41.1"," 42 of 55 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","42","55","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/recommended/240460/","ShadowAngel","ShadowAngel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShadowAngel/","753 products in account","Remember when Wrestling was fun? I lived through the big wrestling boom here in Germany in the early 90's, Ultimate Warrior, Hulk Hogan, Roddy Piper, Bret Hart, the Legion of Doom and we got all the PPV events for free and i remember when Summer Slam 1992 was even shown live back then. Remember when it all fell to pieces? Gone where the heroes of our time, gone were the unique characters. Gone where the Storylines that made you think "Is this still a show?" like Jake "The Snake" Roberts throwing his Cobra at Randy "Macho Man" Savage and it bit him in the arm, blood ran down (it was real blood by the way, Savage insisted on it being real)\nIn 2015 WWE is a far cry from even the Boom Ear of the 90's, the Hogan Era of the 80's in the USA and certainly a far cry from their "ECW for mainsteam"-thing they called the Attitude Era.\n\nYet here we are. WCW and ECW are a distant memory, made a joke be WWE revisionist history (The term "History is written by the winners" is just true here) and with Acclaim (Legends of Wrestling), Spike (Fire Pro Wrestling/King of Colosseum) and AKI (WWF No Mercy) gone, we only have Yuke's left for our wrestling needs. After THQ went bankrupt and 2K took over and kicked out Cory Ledesma i had hope, real hope for a bright future, The first WWF/E Smackdown games were great. there's a reason why WWE Smackdown: Here comes the Pain is held in high regards. There's a reason why Cory Ledesma was hated in wrestling circles.\nAnd i guess there's a reson why we fans should chant "this is boring".\n\nWWE 2K15 offers the usual amount of game modes and match styles with a few things gone from WWE 2K14: Ladder Tag Matches, Tornado Tag Match are gone as well as most of the creation suit: Create an Arena, Create a Championship and even Create a Diva, all gone for no real reason outside of "It's a new console generation, we take out things to present them as new improved features next year". Considering "Create a  female wrest...ups, i mean Diva" has been in the series since WWE Smackdown Shut your Mouth" and "Create a Championship" since Smackdown vs. Raw in 2005, it's lame.\n\nBut back to WWE 2K15: Outside of the regular exhibition matches you have several game modes. First up is the Career  that was introduced with 2K taking over the series from THQ and having Visual Concepts working along side Yuke's. Since i play the NBA 2K series from Visual Concepts i kinda expected the same stuff of starting from the bottom, cutscenes, storylines...the Career mode is crap, you start at the WWE training camp, fight some made up jobbers, got to NXT to fight the same jobbers, then you come to Smackdown to fight the same jobbers until you get some actual WWE wrestlers and what i thought to be a storyline around Roman Reigns and the Shield, i fought them a couple times and....it just ended, with Vicky Guerrero (the game is outdated) telling me that "Creative has nothing for me to do" which is kinda realistic since WWE's creative team is the most uncreative bunch since, i don't know, even Herb Abrams UWF was more creative, even though they produced ♥♥♥♥, so i fought against made up jobbers and actually wwe jobbers like the miz until i made it to Raw. I lost interest already.\n\nThe other mode is the Showcase where you relieve past storylines, that has been in the game since WWE13 (still THQ) where you had the Attitude Era, WWE 2K14 had Wrestlemania and now you have several wrestlers and stories to relieve.  Like the Shawn Michaels - Triple H Story, once good friends (DX) bitter enemies (that's what he have here), you fight several matches as Shawn Michaels or Triple H or somebody else (like RVD or Kane) to relive that story. It's nice but it's hindered by the fact that WWE is deeply afraid or mentioning Chris Benoit and therefore the biggest highlight of this feud, Wrestlemania 20, the HHH vs HBK vs. Benoit match is brushed over in a quick mentioning.\nThe Ultimate Warrior Showcase has the same problems: It feels rushed. You start with Warrior getting the Intercontinental belt from the Honky Tonk Man, you run through a match with Andre the Giant to Wrestlemania 6: Warrior - Hogan, The Ultimate Challenge, we already got that at WWE 2K14's Wrestlemania mode and also WWE Legends of Wrestlemania, that match gets kinda boring, especially since with the QTE's it played out the same every time in 3 games now,, you rush through Wrestlemania 7, the Match made in Hell among other thing but one of the most legendary matches is missing: Warrior - Savage: Summerslam 1992, the last match of the Warrior in the WWF until 1996, is missing, just as the Wrestlemania 5 is missing, just like the storyline with Papa Shango is missing completely.\n\nThe other big mode is WWE Universe. I still haven't figured that one out. Back in the days we had the GM Mode which was a half-♥♥♥♥♥ version of Extreme Wrestling Revenge/Total Extreme Wrestling as a Wrestling Booker/Manage mode. Universe is not even a manger but a non-♥♥♥♥♥ version of a manager where you can change rosters and influence some storylines but it seems to go nowhere at all. I don't know maybe i don't get it but i rather play TEW 2013 and book a wrestling promotion or i play matches and not have a half-asses mixture of both types.\n\nGameplay-wise we have the same crude mixture of Arcade and wanna-be Simulation as the previous years. We got Quick-Time events (especially in the showcase), button mashing (on submission moves), wiggle the stick (on the chain-wrestling lock-ups) among a limitation of direct controls. If i could choose i prefer the Fire Pro Wrestling time-based controls that also take the health of your enemy into account, you can't do the finisher 2 minutes into the match, you have to use quick punches, kicks and moves to wore him down, follow it up with bigger moves and go in for the kill. Even the AKI style of WCW/nWo Revenge and WWF No Mercy was better and it's partially here in WWE 2K15 but you are limited in what you can do. Even back in WWE Smackdown: Here comes the Pain from Yuke's you had 4 moves on the lower body of your opponent, 4 moves on the upper body. Now we have the same developer limiting us to 2 moves on the upper and 2 moves on the lower body. No wonder the crowd in the game boos the fan favourite for repeating moves.\n\nComing to the end of this we come to the technical aspects.\nGraphically the game does look really good, i don't know why Triple H's hair is dark brown most of the time but the wrestlers lookd good, they sweat, they bleed, they act realistically and the moves looks really good. The sound is a mixed bag: The Crowd sounds good, the sound effects are a bit over the top and the commentary is laughably bad. It astoundes me that Visual Concepts can get one of the best commentaries in sports game history in their NBA 2K series while they can't tell Yuke's to give a damn. Jerry Lawler has the same "and he's still not through" and "he puts his educated feet to good use" lines since Here comes the pain over 10 years ago. Michael Cole has the same lines Jim Ross used 10 years ago and especially in the Showcases (like the Shawn Michaels one) you have a distincitve break between the ingame commentary and the cutscene commentary becuase the first one uses Cole/Lawler from 2K15 while the cutscenes use the original commentary from back in the day (and Jim Ross is the second best wrestling commentator of all time making Cole look like an amateur)\n\nAnd not to forget: The game is badly optimized, you have to edit a config file to get some good Frame rates but online game still has a distinctive input lag. Also you're only allowed to download 20 things (bet it wrestlers or logos or movesets) per 24 hours.\n\nI guess for die-hard wrestling fans it's an OK game at a reduced price considering the last proper (the Mdickie games were always a bad joke) wrestling game was WWE RAW back in 2003 but with all the bugs and flaws considered, it's a thumb down for me.","October 29, 2015","false","16.9"," 64 of 94 people (68%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","68","64","94","6","0"

NO Inferno match, NO Backstage Brawl, NO 2 out of 3 falls, etc..\n\n(-) 2v2 gamemodes gone too. NO Mixed Tag-Team match, NO Extreme Rules match, NO Ladder match, NO Table match, NO Steel Cage match, NO TLC match, etc..\n\n(-) Finally, there is NO Handicap match whatsoever. :/\n\n\nAlthough there are some features missing in the game, the game's still pretty awesome.

How can you not catch such simple issues? Ropes completely disapper, characters stop responding half the time, and if you decline a backgound match the game just goes in a never ending loop of start/stop/start/stop (for lack of a better term to describe it). Also, I attempted to load the game manual from the options menu and there is no PC manual, just for the four consoles. Another simple, but damn useful,  thing to miss.\n\nI'm hoping these bugs will pan out. Aside from bugs, I don't know how I feel about the chain wrestling yet. I like the idea that they're trying to expand the game into a more life-life match, but I don't really care for the randomness that is the circular RS hunting. Makes it more luck than skill if you happen to press the right way (at random) before the other guy. Besides, it's so repetitious in the execution. Not every wrestler performs that way.\n\nI'm going to reserve my right to revisit this after we get some patches and updates. Until then, I'd steer clear from this fiasco.\n\nUpdate: After playing with the create a wrestler, I am very disappointed. They took out nearly everything that was useful for creation. Every character is going to look the same now because the creation options are woefully stripped down to nothing. This was my absolute favorite part of WWE games and it's a mere shell of what it once was. Unbelievable.\n\nUpdate 2: So I take the time to attempt creating a wrestler with the extremely limited capabilities this game has, only to find out it's completely pointless for career mode. They wipe out the part of the creation that takes hours to finish (move set). I feel like every time I try something in this game it's just a complete waste of time.\n\nUpdate 3: This will be my final update. I've tried so hard to make the best of a bad situation. I tried editing my character in career mode and three times I experienced run-time errors that shut down the game and completely lost all my alterations. Around 4 hours in total was lost to crashes.

Now, this review was written prior to the PC release of WWE 2k16, but it still remains the same as 2k16 is a much better game. 2k16 has more than double the roster than 15, as well as bringing back alot of features missed in 15.

The pacing of matches mirrors what a real match would be - it's not super fast arcade style fighting, instead taking a more measured approach.  Now, backing off for a minute instead of just attacking constantly isn't just for pretending, it's actually part of the strategy of the match - depending on the type of rasstler you're playing, you might need to control the pace of the match so that you don't over exert yourself.  If you're a more energetic rassler then you'll want to overwhelm your opponent with your superior stamina!\n\nThe reversal system feels just right - not too hard, not too easy, and the CPU reverses moves in just the right quantity to make for a good interesting match.  When it comes to submissions it really feels like you're fighting to get your opponent to tap out.\n\nThe character creator isn't as robust as it used to be in older WWE games when it comes to molding your character's appearance, but it's still at least average.  There's a good amount of clothing and costume items though.  They My Career mode seems fairly interesting - I like how you get rewarded more for putting on a good match, which means both varying your moves and "selling" the match rather than having it be completely one-sided (older games never gave you a reason to do this).","May 2, 2015","true","32.9"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","29","45","6","0"

I used to play on the ps2 every 2 - 3 years. I would always make 2 clown characters one small one huge. Klown King and Mr. Giggles. I remember one of the releases where I could make the bigger character as tall and fat as possible, but I could launch him across the ring from the top rope landing on an opposing wrestler as I yelled... faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat. Aaah memories.\n\nThe game can be quite fun to play, but only once you start to get the hang of it. At first the game is a counter game. There is a weird, lag or sluggish feeling that the characters have off and on. Even when they have full stamina. This causes the player to leave himself open while attempting to make a grapple but the game does not respond. But once the player adapts to this, the AI is easily countered. Eventually allowing for more strikes (punches/kicks) to come out.\n\nI was playing this game and had logged in a whole lot of time on it when I hit a bug. It literally broke the game to the point to where I was unable to save characters. My first career character was fine but the second character did not save properly and was just bugged. Here is what happened. The first character I made was made in My Creation and then imported into my career. The second character was created in my career and eventually exported to the rest of the game. I believe that the second character somehow broke the game. The break doesn't become apparent until you attempt to use the second character in other parts of the game and you cannot export that character until completing my career. If you want to learn how to fix this bug check out the fix in my review video!\n\nIf you are looking for a really great wrestling game this isn't it. But if you are looking for a wrestling game tide you over, this could be it.  In a few months from now there may be mods that fix a lot of the issues with this game if 2K doesn't step up to the plate by then.\n\nFor more details, click below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ug7hgftM2DA","May 15, 2015","true","129.0"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","13","17","7","0"

I played 2k14 on a cousin's PS3 and had a great time, so I thought I would give this a try once it came on sale. I'm glad I did. I generally suck at these type of games because I can never get myself out of the button mashing mindset. This has changed all that. I lost a bit at first, but once I got into the MyCareer mode and started off with the tutorial, I began to really appreciate the timing aspects of everything. To me, it actually feels like the old N64 wrestling games, and that's a good thing.  The graphics are incredible on my 970 and i have barely noticed any stuttering.  If you're on the fence, give it a try. Worst case, you can get a refund.

This game is amazing and they stepped it up lots from the past 3-4 years of the other games. I always thought this game would just be the same as WWE 2k12-2k14. In my mind those games were simply the same. In WWE 2K15 they stepped it up lots making it more fun and having many more things 2 do. I know people might not like this PC port for this game but that's no reason to hate on the game.\n\nPeople are just mad because they don't have the right PC to play this game. Warning: You do need a decent computer to run this game. Anyways, this game is simply amazing. It's action packed with realistic and fun game modes. The graphics this year has improved by lots from the other games and they really picked it up.\n\nAlright, let's start with the game modes. First we have the My Career gamemode. This is a little action packed and fun. First you start off making your own WWE superstar. After you make ya superstar you get to go and have one match showing that you earned the contract to be a WWE Superstar. You do 2-3 matches testing how well you do etc. You move onto the NXT show and start doing tuns of matches. In this mode your superstar is really weak and has very little skill as you go on in everymatch you get points and with these points you can make your WWE superstar better. Such as making them run faster, OMG momments, grapple skills etc. You fight with NXT for a while then you move on and win the NXT championship. Then you move onto Main Event, then superstarts than Smackdown and last Raw. You come across a few titles during that time and have issues and fight with others in the locker room and such through soical media. Sometimes, you are put to a task such as "Get a 5 star match in atleast 2-4 of the matches you are playing. Hours and hours go by fighting and building up your superstar then you get a shot at the WWE championship then you retire.\n\nWWE 2K SHOWCASE is really fun. It's bringing real life events to the video game such as "Path Of the Warrior" and so on. This gamemode is taking real life WWE moments and putting it into the game so you can relive those moments in a video game. It's very fun and you get tasks that you must do.\n\nWWE Universe mode is a fun gamemode to play that you can spend over 1,00,000 hours on and still have a fun time. You do matches and paper views like you would do in real life. It's your own world and you can do whatever you like with the matches. Universe mode takes you into a GM type section where you can do what you want and like such as Making John Cena face Seth Rollins for the WWE championship at WrestleMania.\n\nThese are the three main points on why I think WWE 2k15 is an amazing game and filled with action packed, fun, risk taking game! Yes, there is bugs.... and so on but what game does not have bugs!?","July 5, 2015","true","261.1"," 23 of 36 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","23","36","3","6"

Been playing quite a few on Xbox 360. Just teh past 2 years I haven't bought a game. So eagerly I waited for it to arrive. Pre-Bought, and played the game. Excitement was beheld, as the load screen came up.  Overjoyed as I was able to browse the menus. Quickly I picked the first option to Play a Single match. Selected my guy Bray Wyatt... Randomly let the computer pick its wrestler, it picked Cesaro.\nNice entrances and such, then the bell rang.  Using my 360 controller, I moved in for the attack, did my first move. No problem. Then it came to defending, WHAT THE HECK, press RT to defend (ok ok, I can kinda live with that. Just need to learn timing). But worst is the Right Stick when it come to jocking for a postion. What the heck are they thinking? This is suppuse to be fast paced. Quick in an outs, Not some namby-pamby rotate your stick.\nI liked the old school style a lot better. Bring back the old format that was on Xbox and I am sure Playstation...\nNow that that was said, I would recommend if you can come to grips with the controller setting. the game looks so nice and such. Graphics are up there. Animation is great. (Replays look a little weird at times)\nLearning curve is a bit steep at first if you have not ventured into this type of game before. But if you are patient I am sure that the WRESTLING PLEASURE is there for you to enjoy.\nI will keep trying to plug a way at this a bit more. And hope I can update this to give a more informed opinion. This is only after playing the game for not even a hour.

You obviously have the option to turn the music off.\n\n- Not as much customization as previous WWE games\nBasically you can't create diva's, which sucks as there aren't many in the game inititally. You also can't create arena's, titles or finishers like previous games. The entrance creation is limited with existing superstars entrances and only a few custom options.\n\n- Not all the DLC is available yet.\n\nIf you enjoy WWE and like the look of the gameplay on YouTube etc I recommend you get this.

The WWE SvR and WWE12-14 had some of the most complex and indepth character customizations that have ever existed in Videogames. This is the main reason why many people adore these games and why many choose to buy them.\n\nThat said, WWE 2k15's Create-A-Wrestler features are so painfuly neutered that it's the one of the most limited to have ever exist in a WWE game. It's downright offensive. To give you an example, WWE13 had a total of 86 hairstyles available....WWE 2k15 has a total of 18. Yeah no ♥♥♥♥, it's that bad. I'm not entirely sure who to point the finger on this one. I have a feeling that 2K games had a role in influencing Yuke Games. That or Yuke Games didn't have enough time. What I do know however is that there are no new game modes and some were taken out.\n\nSo if you're looking to make a wild selection of characters like Duke Nukem Vs Star Fox then you're out of luck.\n\nOnly reason I would recommend buying this game is to prove to 2K that porting to the PC is well worth it. It is true that this is the first WWE game to have ever come to the PC, so lets hope for future installments that they keep that going.\n\nAlso the game is slow as ♥♥♥♥ and apparently doesn't use the mouse whatsoever.

There is no 120/144hz support from the looks of it (it recognizes the refresh rate but it doesn't matter due to the locked 60 in game). Entrances are a locked 30. There is no controller rebinding but there is full Keyboard rebinding. This game seems to have zero mouse support as of right now. There is a major bug with the "Red Box Moment" that can happen in the middle of a match. Random fire will shoot out of the ring and the ropes/announce tables will disappear and everyone in the crowd does a T Pose (see my screenshots for an example).\n\nOnline play is inexcusably laggy to the point where the pin meters don't work and matches will move in slow motion. It's unplayable. Trying to view leaderboards cause an instant crash of the game. The voice chat seems to be always on as well. Make sure to mute your mic if you decide to play online.\n\n\nGraphic Options wise you are very limited. You have Anti-Aliasing (up to 8x MSAA & FXAA), Audience Density, Depth of Field, Windowed/Fullscreen (no borderless), VSync and a tessellation setting. That about covers it. No texture resolution or anything to choose shockingly. Audio Options have plenty of sliders to get just the perfect sound levels.\n\nOverall it's a middle of the road port. If you plan on doing single player or local MP then the game will be just fine. Online as of now is in a pitiful state and the game should NOT be purchased for that feature alone. The game doesn't come with Paige either which is just heartbreaking. Still, it's the first WWE game on PC since 2002 and it's not a total disaster!\n\nEDIT: One more MAJOR thing to note. Pretty much none of the DLC is in the game now. If you bought this expecting to play some of it, you're out of luck. It'll apparently be available for download soon.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lxlSniperzlxl/recommended/240460/","lxlSniperzlxl","Snipz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lxlSniperzlxl/","300 products in account","This review is based on my first impressions of the game, coming from last playing a WWE game on the 360 a few years ago and on the PS2 before that. My opinion may change in the future when the games patched as will this review.\n\nThe Game Itself:\n\nThe games current state in my opinion (from what I've seen) is fine, people are having issues at the moment of various things such as invisible robes, low fps, crashing, won't launch, laptop problems. I haven't had these issues, unfortunately for them so I can't relate however. My ONLY issue currently with this game is My Career mode and Create a Superstar which I will mention later in the review.\n\nAnother thing to mention is, people seem to be confused about the DLC. Yes, it is ALL free, but its not all here on day one release it will released eventually as a free update. For now we have the Hogan and Sting character packs.\n\nThe game looks stunningly good compared to the past WWE games I'm used to, of course the audience still look a slight bit odd but its fine. Animations look really well done and smooth although movement when walking and running can feel a bit janky but I got used to it. You can use Keyboard and Mouse or Gamepad, I haven't tried K/M at all but the Gamepad works just fine. One thing I dislike about the game/controls is 'chain wrestling' where you grapple your opponent and choose 3 options, if yours is the same as the opponents then you try again until someone wins, once that's over you move the right stick around an axis to find a sweet spot then hold it there to do a grapple to your opponent, then you do it again and if they win they do something to you and it goes on, I could go on forever. This mechanic just feels so weird to me and basically luck based, its so out of place from what I'm used to before, luckly tho! I found in the 'gameplay balancing' options you could somewhat disable it which is quite handy.\n\nThe game also has this, replay mechanic where you watch your character do there finisher again? to me, why would I need to see it again. To me its not needed so I turned it off, there's also highlights at the end of a match where it shows the 'best' bits of the match between the two fighters. Now my issue with this is, it starts and the commentator says "Lets watch some highlights of the match" then when the next one starts, the commentator said it again, and again.. so I turned it off as it was annoying.\n\nGame Modes:\n\nThe game features a ton! of content, having not played some of the previous games I don't know what modes are missing but that's fine with me so I have no issue there.\n\nYou can get straight into a match, choose your type of match from single, single tlc, hell in a cell, elimination chamber you name it, it's probably there. You can choose any character (of course if you've unlocked them or have the DLC) to fight against each other. There's 2K showcase which is basically you follow the storyline of some of the things that happened in WWE history and try to replay them, doing objectives during a match will unlock you outfits, characters, stages etc. which is quite cool also.\n\nMy Career mode, now this... I can't say anything as currently when I go into it, select new save, select new character during the loading screen the game crashes. Vice versa with create a superstar, it crashes during loading so.. yeah major part of the game there isn't working. However, it is working for some people, why I do not know but it is frustrating for many people and myself.\n\nWWE Universe is basically a calender of WWE shows and you can set it up however! you like, who fights who, where, when, how you name it. You can choose what team people are on, what brand, whether the crowd likes them or not, practically everything you want, even your created superstars can be used in this mode. I haven't experimented a whole lot with this but from first glance it looks like it could be really fun once you have a majority of characters setup, unlocked and a roster sorted out.\n\nOptions:\n\nGraphical options, in reality there are very few. When you boot the game you have a launcher, the launcher has the options there which are:\n\n- Resolution\n- Vsync\n- Shadows\n- Depth Of Field\n- FXAA\n- MSAA up to x8\n- Audience Tessalation\n- Audience Density\n- Windowed Mode on/off\n\nNot a ton of options, and no options for textures or model quality concerning superstars. Also one thing to mention is blood, its for some reason off by default. I found this in the gameplay options once I was in game and started messing with settings. Handy to know.\n\nOn my build of GTX 750ti, i5 3.2Ghz  and 4GB RAM (no SSD) I was able to get a stable 30 FPS in entrances (which are capped to 30 btw in entrances) and smooth 60 in matches with some drops between 50-60 lowest its gone is 44/45 but it soon rockets back up. This with settings at 1080p, no Vsync, Shadows on, Depth of Field off (heard it caused issues) no FXAA or MSAA (you REALLY don't notice it off, well at least I don't) Audience Tessalation off and Density at 75% fullscreen.\n\nOverall:\n\nIn my opinion, the game as is currently works fine! may take some getting used to as I myself have not played a WWE game in quite some time. It looks really good graphicly, controls are kinda eh but I'll get used to them and I'm sure many others will have to (especially using keyboard) The game modes have a ton of replay (to me) especially Universe, once My Career mode works I can comment on it, but everything else works great.\n\n2K have done a great port (to me) as said I've only had one issue, so if you think about buying WWE 2K15 for PC, be aware that users are experiencing quite a few bugs. Sadly I can't comment. But it is a great game, gonna have a lot of fun with this!\n\n\n\n","April 29, 2015","true","23.1"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Some visual jankiness from the consoles is still present (and can be fixed by removing camera cuts), but all in all a decent PC port with hours worth of gameplay in both MyCareer and WWE Universe mode.\n\nAnother neat little addition is the 2K Showcase, where the meat of the game (characters, arenas, clothes) is unlocked. The base game itself contains the 2011 feud between the now departed CM Punk and John Cena and the 2002-3 feud between lifelong friends Triple H and Shawn Michaels. Additional Showcase feuds will be added through the already included DLC, but the release date on those is TBA.\n\nGraphically, the game looks a LOT better than previous iterations. Unlike '13 and 2K14, where every main roster wrestler looked like CAWs with custom textures, the character models here are top notch. Even minor things like the referee, the audience, and background filler have been upgraded to better fit the next-gen experience.","April 28, 2015","true","75.2"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","18","32","2","0"

This can't be overstated.  If you have the controllers and a badass enough of a PC, you can have up to 4 (I think) people playing on a single PC.  I can't stress enough how nice of a feature this is, as someone with controllers and a badass PC.  A real selling point.\n+ Controller support!  A big plus.  I use a PS3 controller over Bluetooth and it works flawlessly.  Much more intuitive.\n+ Graphics are reasonable, for a port.  Some of the face scans aren't great, but by and large, the textures and animations are a bit better than I expected, honestly.\n+ Good character customization\n+ Integrates well with Steam.  Achievements, matchmaking, "invite friends to your game" functionality, all that stuff.\n+ Alt-Tabs excellently.  Full-screen Windowed mode would be nice, but with alt-tab handling like this, its not required.\n+ Unlockables actually feel like something you want to chase, and they're reasonably achievable.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Keyboard controls are really, really awkward.  Like seriously.  There's no mouse support at all, which I found alarming.  But for real, play on Easy, or buy a controller.  You'll be much happier.\n- Somewhat unstable.  I've had a few crashes that happen at seemingly random times.  Might just be my tendency to tab out and ♥♥♥♥ like that.\n- Load times.  I'm on an SSD, I was a bit disappointed with the loading times.  Skyrim loaded up with 4k textures loads significantly faster.  Not sure what's up with that.\n- Sometimes the AI opponents go into LOLCENAWINS mode and just decide that you're going to lose the match, no matter what.  Really irritating.\n- Announcers are obnoxious, but you learn to tune them out.\n- Game elements are roughly 1 year behind kayfabe story lines, FYI\n- Online play can be buggy.  I've found lots of issues with inexplicable disconnects and "game is no longer available" messages.  That, and if someone is playing on a potato computer, your graphics WILL be slowed down to compensate for theirs.  Source: I know someone who plays on Potato Computer and experienced this first hand.  Really strange.\n- Sami Zayn is in the game.  ♥♥♥♥ Sami Zayn.\n\nOverall:\nAn average port of a good game.  Mod support is baked in, and mods are already rolling out.  Playing with a controller makes a huge difference.  Lots of nice features, which overcomes being rough around the edges.","April 30, 2015","true","23.7"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","19","34","5","0"

I'm comparing this to the PS4/XBOXONE version's of this game, i thought on a technical standpoint it would be hard to beat because for the first time on a console, a WWE game is at 60 frames locked with no drops and the highest graphic setting which looks great. But the PC version is equal to that if not better because of PC's graphic choices.  The game is an exact port of the PS4/XBOXONE version, and the big complaint with 2K15 and why i say this is the best choice is that the original game is lacking in the depth in characters, modes, and more things to do unless you shell out 30 dollars for a season pass to get 3 more showcase stories instead of the regular 2. The season pass adds lot's of new characters and additions which fills the empty spots int he original game. Except on PC it's all included with the game without paying for any of the DLC. So on a financial point getting it for 54.99 or 49.99 when i got it on sale pre-ordered. Is a much better deal than getting it on console for 69.99 and paying an additional 30 dollars for a season pass. So PC is definitely the best option for WWE 2K15 and takes everything good with the next gen console versions and improves it, only con was the few bugs that will be fixed.

I am not a current WWE fan by any means. I stopped watching back in the Invasion era back in like 2004, so I am very disconnected with the show. Always like the Smackdown games back on the Playstation. This game attracted me with its career mode. The career mode is great starting from the bottom and getting yourself noticed to get to PPV's etc. One feature I think is amazing on this game is the 2K showcase. It takes you through a whole story of a historic rivalry which you get to play through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinDP/recommended/240460/","JustinDP","JustinDP","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JustinDP/","383 products in account","As a pretty significantly huge fan of pro wrestling (I've essentially been watching it since I was two years old, when my grandfather would watch it while I was little), I've been waiting quite a long while for a moddable PC version of a wrestling game. So, you can imagine my delight when it was suddenly announced out of nowhere that WWE 2K15 was getting a release in all of half a week. Unfortunately, what I ended up getting was so terrible that even my fandom was not enough to blind me to it.\n\nFirstly, the game is unoptimized as hell. I've got what I'd consider a pretty decent gaming computer. Everything EXCEPT this game I've been able to run on high, if not ultra high settings. Yet, with this game the only way I've even remotely been able to make the game playable is to turn all of the rather meager settings to the lowest available option, as well as turning the crowd completely off so right off the bat the immersion they're going for is destroyed. You will NOT find options such as being able to toggle texture quality and whatnot to help you run the game better.\n\nSecondly, I ran into a very massive game breaking issue. After plugging away 30 hours or so into the game and basically unlocking 98% of the unlockables, I thought I'd start messing around with WWE Universe mode. I had completely 100% completed 2K Showcase Mode. I had completely finished MyCareer mode. It was basically all I had left to do. So, in order to make Universe more interesting I downloaded some community created Create-A-Wrestlers. ...and after a few of them suddenly they were all giving me save corruption messages. A message that would pop up any time I went into any menu. I attempted to fix the issue, using a guide that some fan made. Unfortunately this guide had zero effect on my copy and the only way I had to fix the problem was to basically reset the game - losing EVERYTHING I had unlocked, and finished to this point. 30 hours down the drain. As you might imagine, I'm not exactly too enthusiastic to do it all over again in the hopes that it won't just mess up again later when I get to the point where I'm ready to mess with Universe mode again.\n\nWhile I won't complain about the fact that not all of the DLC is available as the store page did mention some being released later - I admit I don't really understand why. This game is basically a direct port of the PS4/Xbox One editions. I'm not even convinced they didn't merely just download the disc data over and call it a day without tweaking it. On those consoles all of the DLC is already released. So why the delay? At the very least why delay the accelerator DLC which would allow me to simply toggle everything as unlocked when the entire game went to hell and I needed to start over? I also don't truly understand why Paige isn't available at all. I get that she was season pass exclusive. But the data is clearly there somewhere and you chose to not do the season pass on PC. Why not simply throw her in later along with the rest? It just screams lack of effort on their part.\n\nAs for the game itself? The game is greatly hollow compared to previous years on consoles. A good chunk of match types are flat out missing. You cannot create a female wrestler in the CAW even though there is actually an unlockable that requires you to win a match WITH a created female. Another sign they just simply didn't care to edit the game to remove something leftover from a previous incarnation. MyCareer was interesting, but was somewhat poorly implimented and often came off as more tedious than interesting. Storylines were simply too spaced out and most of your career consisted of doing tune-up matches for the sake of having a match. Often I'd get a storyline that would tell me that if I beat X amount of matches I'd get a title shot - and then when I beat all the matches Triple H would tell me that he can't give me the title shot now, but someday he would promise to give me one for realsies. It just made the majority of the career feel pointless. In addition when you win the world title, the entire career mode ends which is a shame as your feuds as world champion would have likely been the most interesting part.\n\n2K Showcase mode was interesting enough, as it allows you to relive two famous rivalries and the key matches that went along with them - but it wasn't anything we hadn't seen before already with the 30 years of WrestleMania gimmick in a previous title. Also, unlocking old versions of current roster members who have little to no difference in their moves and mannerisms rather than simply making it an alternate attire just seems silly. Also silly: Unlocking no less than three HBK ring attires that are the same ring attire with a slightly different vest during his entrance while actively showing you photos and video footage of the clearly different ring attire it's supposed to be. Decent, but not game-saving.\n\nCreate-A-Story, and Create-A-Arena are gone. Additionally, you are limited to a set amount of downloads a day (when they're not simply corrupting your entire save halfway through them). You're limited to 25 CAWs, even though logically a computer would have infinite space to allow you as many as you'd like.\n\nI want to give this game nothing but rousing praise in the hopes more games get released in the future. I simply can't. If I was giving this a score rating out of 10 it would be a 5 if I was being generous. I can't recommend it. I got it as a gift, and I feel kind of bad my friend paid 50 bucks for it. This game is worth 20 tops.","May 6, 2015","false","38.1"," 26 of 49 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","26","49","0","0"

It has taken many steps backwards in types of matches and character creation. However the MyCareer mode is fantastic, the graphics are amazing, it takes a more realistic approach, rather than the fast pace you have in the WWE/SvR games, and it still manages to be really fun to play.\n\nThe character creation, being so limited, makes it a huge disappointment, and as you can guess, takes out a lot of the fun. But the approach it takes on gameplay and the graphics it has, is amazing. It isn't worth $50 in my opinion. So I recommend waiting for it to go on sale. It is still a great game. The only con to gameplay in my opinion, is the grappling, rather than press A faster than your opponent to win a grapple chain, you instead have a rock, paper, scissors-like system which makes it feel more like chance to win, rather than determination and actually feeling apart of the match.\n\nOther than that. Still a good game. Get it when it goes on sale.

On the one hand I am overjoyed that a WWE game has finally come to PC after nearly 12 years. Its really a solid game in terms of its gameplay, however the game is stripped of many features and match types that it feels like half a game. MyCareer is a mode with very much potential, but right now it has too many repetitive matches and not enough story lines. The Universe mode is a fun mode to play however the lack of match types really affects it being spectacular. I would like future WWE games to have more match types like I Quit, Special Referee, Tag Team TLC, 8 man Tag Team, 12 Man Tag etc.","March 7","true","47.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Replays are non-existant and are instead a picture of your wrestler in the ring with no ropes (again).\n\nWas thrilled when i saw this coming out on PC but sadly 2k have yet again proven that they cant be bothered testing the game. The bugs are so obvious, all you have to do is play 1 wrestling match and their there, right in front of your very own eyes!!! Seeing as this is supposed to be a wrestling game i would have thought they would test at least one wrestling match before releasing the game!!! Also 2k are yet to fix the issue of not being able to create divas, an issue thats existed since the release of the console versions (over 6 months ago).\n\nOther than the bugs the game seems to run smoothly. I havent hit any bugs affecting performance so if you dont mind the game looking a bit wrong i would recommend it. Sadly after 7 hours the visual bugs are starting to annoy me. Would also like an option to import sound tracks, this wasnt done on the console versions but it makes no sense to not include the feature on the PC version seeing as computers tend to have music stored on them.\n\nOverall I would just about recommend WWE 2K15. The bugs are annoying but should be fixed if 2k can be bothered. Regardless of the bugs the actual game is great and runs smoother than the console versions that ive played on (PS4 and Xbox One) which, in my opinion, outweighs the asthetic issues.","April 28, 2015","true","124.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Its a next gen game so it looks amazing and surprisingly very stable as well on a half decent gaming rig.\n\nA few points:\n\nCareer Mode is very bare bones was really a struggle to keep playing at times. The ground work is there though so im hoping 2K16 will improve on this. There were a few rivalries and storylines but they were few and far between, it seemed at times to be just one match after another with very little build up for the big matches.\n\nThe actual gameplay is IMO very good. It took me a while to get used to the chain wrestling and quick reversal controls but when i did my matches were very fluid and satisfying. Be prepared for frustration though early on as it is radically different.\n\nThe Create a Superstar feature wasnt too shabby but again seemed to have less features than previous titles. Create a Diva is foremost amongst these. Maybe work in progress for 2k16.\n\nWould have also liked to have seen a bigger roster of past and present superstars so again..il hoping next title they will build on this and give us that bit more than this time around.\n\nAll in all its a pretty good game that gave me over 40 hours of playtime, just a few features that need extra attention in the next title.\n\nI forgive them though since its the first game for next gen and im hoping most PC gamers will support this so we continue to get wrestling games now and in the future.","October 10, 2015","true","72.7"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","9","16","0","0"

When it was recently announced on WWE.COM that last year’s WWE 2K15 was going to be ported to PC, I was ecstatic. There hadn’t been a PC wrestling game since WWF In Your House back in 1996, and it was long overdue. WWE 2K15 from developers Visual Concepts/Yukes and publisher 2K Sports has some fairly small boots to fill, and anything was better than nothing. Gone is the arcade-style control schemes, power-ups or special Mortal Kombat attacks. Sadly, no, you cannot summon a tombstone from The Undertaker, but you can GIVE a Tombstone Piledriver as the Undertaker, so there’s that.\n\nSad to say, though, once you leave the Gorilla Position and go through the curtain, the presentation – much like the current WWE product – is lacking in substance and style.\n\nLet’s get the elephant out of the room; this is a straight port of the XBOX One/PS4 version that was released in 2014. Since this is a direct port, I could easily cop out and just say “find a console review.” However, because I love you all so very much, I’m going to pretend for the moment that there was no such thing as a console release and thoroughly run this game through the ringer, so if you want to skip to the end and rage at the numbers, I understand. However, the biggest issue with a console-to-PC port is that all the issues (and I do mean “all”) will be copied over en masse. Shoddy hit-detection, graphical/audio glitches, muddy textures, and otherwise lackluster presentation detract from the overall package. Fear not, though, as there’s a legitimate reason to pick up this game if you’re a solid PC gamer, which I’ll discuss below.\n\nFrom the get-go, you’re given a paltry twenty or so Superstars to choose from (and what little remains of the women’s “Diva” division) with the majority of them are locked away from use until you play either the “The Streak” featuring The Undertaker, 2K Showcase mode, or the much-touted MyCareer mode. Both have their pros and cons, but you’ll need to play through both of the latter if you ever want to unlock your personal favorite Superstar or if you simply grow tired of beating down Kofi Kingston or Heath Slater for the hundredth time. (Seriously, why does Heath Slater still have employment?)\n\nThis game CAN be played with a keyboard, but, trust, me, you’re not going to want that. The controls are, in a word, clunky. At first, anyway. No matter your skill-level or experiences, you’re going to have a bit of learning curve when starting your first matches. Control schemes are simplified to a strike/grapple system, with moves being context-sensitive to what direction you push on the movement stick as well as what condition your opponent is in. For example, the same button-presses that allow you to suplex someone from a standing position will also allow you to stomp someone’s face in if they’re lying down on the mat. While this is inherently simplistic, you’ll find yourself accidentally pulling off moves you didn’t intend, which can lead to lost matches on a frustratingly-high basis.\n\nAlso, if you’re ever feeling down, turn on Anti-Aliasing in the options and watch a replay; it’s a guaranteed (currently) glitch that results in the ring-posts and ropes vanishing, defaults the crowd to arms-outstretched models, and all player/NPC characters face-down on the mat. It’s a thing of beauty. That said, the glitches are near-constant, but never to the point where the game is unplayable. You’re still going to scream on occasion when your grapple turns into your Superstar climbing the turnbuckle… From the ladder you were on just moments before. Teleportation seems to be everyone’s domain in WWE 2K15, not just The Undertaker and Bray Waytt.\n\nOverall, for an initial offering, WWE 2K15 shows plenty of promise as a rookie. Sure, it’s easy to write the game off as a sub-par experience, but regardless of all the issues, the game is still a blast for any wrestling fan and worth a purchase. In my opinion, modding is going to be the thing that keeps this game out of the unemployment line or late-night infomercials, fixing the various glitches and using “unofficial patches,” wherever possible to breathe new life into this soon-to-be-stagnant game. As it stands currently, the game is a B+ player at best, maybe even dipping into the “backyard wrestling” variety. Still, WWE 2K16 is going to have to up their efforts, but for now, the game is begging for more content, which the PC community looks primed and ready to deliver.","May 6, 2015","true","71.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You know the guys that are interesting. The new guys looks stupid, and well. I guess they could say Hulk Hogan looks stupid then and now. I retract that statement. Though I think it is hard to deny the appeal of the older guys. Also you have to play rock paper scissors type of thing for starting control of a match, and QTEs here and there. What is that about. However, this is accually a very good wrestling game and fun.\nSo the graphics and performance are fine. I had one crash on the performance side; while trying to replay a match it had a glitch, That was at around an hour in and have not had another. I also got some very rare pause. It resumes fine, but it is not welcome.The graphics are pretty good here and you will need a decent GPU to run this correctly. Something the power of the Xbox One really to get a good looking game. So 660gtx or 7770 or so. That being said this is a really good looking game at times, though some wrestlers look strange. Like DDP, Andrea, and Savage. Others look great; like Hogan, Flair, and all of the newer guys. The crowd is all rendered decently and packed if you can run it. The animations mostly look awesome. As for the port qulity. Well... You have less options here than anything else in the game. You have resolution/frame rate, FXAA, MSAA, Crowd size, and that about it. So make sure you have a decent GPU. That being said it does not really stress my GPU that much. This is just a beefed up port and that is all you can expect.\nSound is another stronge point with some let down. The announcers really do not say enough different things. On the otherside the intros are pretty good as well as the sound effects. Character Creater lets you choose what the announcer calls your fella. This could and should be better. The announcer should have clips of sounding out letters that we put together. Instead I am stuck with Bill Gold Burglur or Goldman, Scott Mall, Scott Spider, and Ted D B Ox. Eh... Close enough. Rather than getting each letter sounded out and making it ourselves. Entrance music leaves a lot to be desired as well. Custome characters do not have much original stuff to pick from.\nCharacters wise I do feel they should have had more. Mrs. Elizbeth, Hart, and Piper really should be here. The newer guys are all fine, and a big bonus is the WCW pack included. Though Goldberg should have been in there. What we do get is mostly great, except for the '11 Orton and Orton 04 and Orton 13 and... That is a constume change disgused as a different character and to many do it. If they wanted to make a difference what about the guys that had changed a lot over their careers. Andrea was taller and 150 pounds lighter in his early years. So Andea 77 would make for a far better game then Shamus from 3 weeks ago. Though the Undertaker from 91 is in here so that is cool. That being said there is enough to find a favorite.\nGameplay wise this is a mixed bag. The reversal system is a pain. It is do able, but not absolute. You can turn it off as well as most anythnig else. The reversal I turned off for the CPU but I can still do it. That gets me to the mechanics. A man down tends to stay down. Seriously be aggressive, because it is a pain to get back in control. The other issue is my biggest problem with the game. Pin fall. Being pinned is the most annoying, idiotic method I could immagine. Hold a button and release on a mark. So first time mark is big, then it gets smaller. No matter how stronge your character is or weak the cpu is. Submission you tap a button. This makes more sense. Everything else though is good. Moves are easy to pull off but a little complicated to finding out which one you want. Physics are good and the hits are hard. There is an amazing wrestling game in here. There really is. But, you may not want to learn it. This is best played with a controller and every single button is used. I'm talking D pad and Right stick are all used and nessesary. Once I got a feel for it I was happy with it.\nSo should you buy this? Depends on what you are expecting I guess. This is the first wrestling game I bought since No Mercy and my first on PC since WCW Thunder(it took nearly 20 years to get over it). I am really enjoying myself with 2k15. The Caw wrestler list is decent, but I have to make the old old guys like Ernie The Big Cat Ladd and Bruno. Though it  is easy enough. Personally this is a buy for $12.50 and given that Hogan will not appear in 2k16(if it comes to PC) it could be worth it for more. Not $50-60, but $30 all day. To me $12 is a great deal and a buy for any current or former wrestling fan. It is stupid fun as pro wrestling is, but that is still fun. Sometimes the best kind of fun.","February 7","true","33.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, now the series has finally returned and honestly, after the nostalgia wears off it is just decent. I mean, while MyCareer is certainly entertaining, it has its limitations and being that I've been living off MDickie games for the past few years, and have seen promos for 5 Star Wrestling, honestly I'm left feeling like the same issues that existed back when PS2 was current gen still exist.\n\nThere is seemingly only a strong focus on making everyone look realistic, and the game just good enough so that the majority of the complaints can only be personal. However, as many already know, this year's game is stripped to the minimum due to 2K trying to make this their game and no longer just something they bought off of THQ. Unfortunately though, whether you prefer to play as wrestlers or sim everything, you won't find this game to be long awaited and well deserved. At the same time though, it does feel better than nothing and perhaps could just be a taste of what is to come.","May 30, 2015","true","744.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I'd highly recommend it to all the WWE / Wrestling fans.\n\nAs usual, just like any other game, WWE 2K15 has its own pros and cons.\n\n(+) Gameplay: I don't understand the logic behind negative reviews regarding the gameplay, it's by no means slow. It's hands down by far the best in the series so far, keeping realism and joy in mind, this couldn't have been any better. Animations starts to change as you progress in a match and it looks spectacular, it does not affect the gameplay in any negative way, it makes it more enjoyable and heart racing. It is exactly as it should be.\n\n(+) Graphics: There's nothing much to say about that, It didn't lag behind. it is as it should be given the current gen graphics.\n\n(-) Online: The only negative thing about this game is online, if you're looking to buy it only to play online then I wouldn't recommend it. Frequent disconnection and terrible matchmaking is really a pain in this game not to mention that kicking out of pin in online matches is literally impossible.\n\n(+-) Commentary: Commentarty has improved a lot compared to the previous installments of the 2k series but it still tends to get annoying at times due to repetition of same old phrases and of course some of the phrases from the previous games are also there which tends to be sickening if you've played the previous installments a lot..\n\nThere's lack of match types and stuff in this game but it's not that big of a problem.\n\nThe 2K Showcase mode offers hours of fun and the career mode itself despite being very bland, it's still kinda fun for some reason, I played it 20+ hours and it was mostly the same throughout. There were very few cutscenes and dialogues. Starting in 2015 and ending your career in virtual 2030, you'll keep getting same messages from Vicky Guerrero for all those 15 virtual years.\n\nAll in all, despite the lack of modes and bland career mode with terrible online, WWE 2k15 is still packed with lots of fun and is worth buying. The gameplay has never been more fun and playing multiplayer on one screen is of course the best thing about WWE 2k15. It's endless fun given the big roster.\n\n+ Gameplay (10/10)\n+ Graphics / Animations\n+ 2K Showcase Mode\n+ Big roster\n+ Career mode\n-  Lack of match types\n-  Terrible online\n\n*9/10* (Awesome)","August 8, 2015","true","151.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

First, the graphics are nice some lag during certain entrances but other then that it is fine. Some glitches like the replays don't work or the ropes are not visible but I haven't come across anything that has majorly impacted my gaming experience yet. The 2k story mode is challenging and can get frustrating at times to complete the objective for the bonus. (Also please keep in mind you can go back and try to complete those objectives when you finish) Universe mode is basically the same as it always has been but with story clues that you can unlock by playing matches or certain rivalry matches. The regular exhibition does not have a big match variety as in previous games. Only 2 types of 2v2 tag matches Normal and Elimination. There is no inferno match which was disappointing. The reversal system can be frustrating as well because it works like this when the reversal button appears on the screen it will say you were too early too late or reverse it. I personally have gotten too early or too late when I felt like I didn't but that's just me. Career mode is fun you start from NXT and work your way up. The one thing I don't like about it is the stamina system and here is an example. (I was in a steel cage match vs Randy Orton I hit my finisher but since it used all my stamina I fell down and could not get up and Randy Orton got up before me even though I just hit him with my finisher. I am still down spamming the get up button as Randy proceeds to climb the cage I finally get up but fall to one knee. I am still spamming the get up button and Randy is still climbing the cage. He climbs over the top and wins the match and I am still on one knee and this is all after Randy just took a finisher from me. I hope this review helps. I would gives this game an overall rating of 8/10.","May 23, 2015","true","191.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Even more so true, especially if you're a fan of WWE, wrestling games, & fighting games - this game should be right up your alley; it's just a really good wrestling game, IMHO.\n\n2K15 here has a great foundation now set for future wrestling games - and especially if bought on sale (which has been around $13 on Steam and elsewhere), you're likely going to get your money's worth here somewhere. Whether it's MyCareer, MyUniverse, or 2K Showcase - there's going to be at least be something here for someone who likes these types of wrestling games; especially even more so true, if you're a WWE fan.\n\nAfter at least 95 hours (or so), I always seem to find more time for a few hours worth of gameplay (especially in MyUniverse Mode) or at least just squeeze in one more match - so, that has to be speak for a lot here; as I always seem to find some time to play this very good wrestling game.","January 3","true","155.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuramasaEdge/recommended/240460/","MuramasaEdge","Rico","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuramasaEdge/","233 products in account","Played this game for 16 hours. At least six of those hours were spent updating the roster and downloading CAWs in order to try and make this game at least somewhat up-to-date.\n\nSpent over an hour creating a CAW of myself. The body features are the absolute most primitive that they've been since the PS2 era and I found that I could only facially make a guy that somewhat resembled me and actually looks like every other CAW out there. Clothing system was good in terms of detail, but extremely poor in terms of not being able to mirror knee/elbowpads and make the character's attire symmetrical. What should have taken me no more than 20 minutes took over an hour thanks to poor optimisation and awful loading times.\n\nNo game should require the amount of set-up and 'housekeeping' that this one does. You insist on making a WWE sports game, yet you refuse to give it the kind of updates and authenticity in terms of how up-to-date the roster is as well as not providing nearly enough tools to create missing characters for ourselves. If you're not going to have Zach Ryder in the game, but you're willing to keep his moveset in there as a template, is it really too much to ask to have access to his music and tron as well, considering they are available in your library?! Edge and Christian were absent from this one, again, there's moves and move templates, but no music...no tron...no tools!!\n\nSpeaking of tools, the actual meat and gravy of the game itself is still riddled and infested with bugs, including a really awesome ( :/ ) one that my CAW encountered while defending his NXT title in the extremely sparse, non-voiced MyCareer mode. I selected 'Spear 1' as his finish, only to find that not once, but twice did my character fail to lock on to the enemy character, miss the attack and actually take damage, drop to a knee and allow the opponent to take over the flow of the match. This is game breaking and unacceptable of a full priced title in 2015. I've read that this was a known issue months ago, so the fact that this game has become abandonware in such a short space of time is absolutely astonishing to me.\n\nEven on low settings with V-Sync turned off, performance is extremely shoddy and controller input frequently lags behind the action, which in a game where you are utterly, crippilingly reliant on reversing everything, completely breaks the gameplay experience.\n\nThis game was released in April and was never fixed. I've paid my hard earned money for this game and it was never fixed.\n\nI genuinely used to love WWE games and was extremely excited for this one finally releasing on PC...I thought of the many awesome and incredible things that the modding community could do with it, custom titantrons, custom music, community roster updates...all of these things were blocked by 2K because this is a direct port of the console version of the game, warts and all. Not only are the creation tools provided substandard, but the game doesn't...even...work\n\n2K, I really, honestly and genuinely wish that I didn't have to write this. When you aquired this license from THQ, I celebrated that aquisition because I believed you'd do what needed to be done and overhaul the ageing technology and deliver the ultimate WWE sports game. I'm sad that I've been proven wrong about you and that I have to tell you today how absolutely horrible my experience with this game has been.\n\nI'm sorry to say that as it stands, I'm not only finished with your WWE games but also with 2K games as a whole, because quite frankly, when I pay my hard earned money for an entertainment product and it does the exact opposite of what it's supposed to do, then you're doing it wrong for making it and I'm doing it wrong for buying it and putting up with it.\n\nMy biggest suggestion in closing would be to take a year out and figure out how to improve the game, rather than releasing seasonal updates that are out-of-date, not fun to play and unpolished/finished.\n\nGood Luck.\n\n3 / 10\n\nEDIT: I understand based on reading and video that WWE2K16 is a similar story, in that it has a huge roster that is mostly out-of-date, has failed to include the HUGELY important Four Horsewomen and again has a slew of bugs affecting gameplay. Again, I can't recommend enough skipping 2K17 and focusing on what you need to to bring this up to scratch.","November 12, 2015","false","18.5"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

This means less locking-up and more in your face fast pace action and less move to be assigned during character creation.  Chain wrestling is cool, but slows down the gameplay.\nIf you have played the old WWE games you would feel a very lackluster amount of customization options. If you have played the game on the next gen consoles, then you are basically getting the exact same game, and if you are expecting a smoother experience because it's running on a PC then i am afraid i have got some bad news. The port isn't too great. I'm getting massive amounts of Lag on my Asus G550 that can run most games on High without many problems. The DLC just arrived, so that'll probably add some hours of gameplay.\nSO\nIf you want the game for the sake of gameplay and fighting mechanics, then grab this game.\nIf you want the game for the downright crazy levels of customization in WWE game and the ability to shape the world of the WWE universe in your vision then you probably want to get an earlier title HOWEVER i would still recommend this game to anyone who is a a wrestlng fan because at the very least it still offers fun gameplay","June 3, 2015","true","91.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Would not get for 50 bucks maybe 20-30. It's the first wwe game on pc and is pretty good for their first pc port. Though there are some flaws with the game in general not the port. First off when compared to the previous titles such as WWE '13 and Smackdown VS Raw 2011, customization is severly limited. No longer can you create odd abstract characters (Hulk, Spongebob etc.). But it's not just the body customization that has been limited it's everything. The clothing is very VERY limited. Only 2 frontal baseball caps? There's about 10 haircuts to choose from compared to the 30-40 in previous games it's terrible. But it's 2K's second wwe game. No onto the game itself. It seems everyone's going on about how terrible controls are.  Personally I find them to be okay for a pc wrestling game. I would not call it unplayable but a controller would be a nice addition. Though it is a bit slower-paced when compared to the last games made before 2K took over you gotta understand 2k's used to makign realistic sports games so no wonder it will become more realistic in terms of gameplay. The roster is a bit smaller than usual but it does feature some epic legends like hogan,sting,the ultimate warrior etc.If you're a die-hard WWE fan I would get it if not then wait for the sale","August 5, 2015","true","33.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The actual gameplay is 9/10, with you being rewarded for doing different stuff and having fun instead of mashing same few moves.\n\nWhat is wrong is bad tutorial which led to about 2  hours of sadness and getting rekt, before i could figure out how some things worked. But after it? Fun unbound! Balanced 'ladder' curve, amazing 2v2 matches (single most fun mode for me, lobbing stairs at ring while running around and being an assohle without being disqualified was amazing run in smack a dude run off.)\n\nWhat also is lacking is interactions with people outside of the ring, press conferences, photoshoots with fans, hanging out with other pros and having a good time, that kinda thing. It doesnt need to be mandatory, just for those who are willing. Because for me it would mean a better immersion = higher game quality.\nSome music playing during the actual fights would be great, aswell as effects like fire, fireworks, smoke or whatever just as cosmetical stuff to spice things up and accentiate some of the more solid smacks : )\n\nMaybe its my current 38 C  body temperature speaking, but i had a lot of fun in this game.

Like the create a wrestler has way way way less things you can do and it seems like there are way less match types. I thought I heard that this is a new build so I have high hopes for WWE 2k16 which will hopefully come to PC that is the main reason I bought this one even with the bad console reviews just to get them making on PC platform..

Would not get for 50 bucks maybe 20-30. It's the first wwe game on pc and is pretty good for their first pc port. Though there are some flaws with the game in general not the port. First off when compared to the previous titles such as WWE '13 and Smackdown VS Raw 2011, customization is severly limited. No longer can you create odd abstract characters (Hulk, Spongebob etc.). But it's not just the body customization that has been limited it's everything. The clothing is very VERY limited. Only 2 frontal baseball caps? There's about 10 haircuts to choose from compared to the 30-40 in previous games it's terrible. But it's 2K's second wwe game. No onto the game itself. It seems everyone's going on about how terrible controls are.  Personally I find them to be okay for a pc wrestling game. I would not call it unplayable but a controller would be a nice addition. Though it is a bit slower-paced when compared to the last games made before 2K took over you gotta understand 2k's used to makign realistic sports games so no wonder it will become more realistic in terms of gameplay. The roster is a bit smaller than usual but it does feature some epic legends like hogan,sting,the ultimate warrior etc.If you're a die-hard WWE fan I would get it if not then wait for the sale","August 5, 2015","true","33.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The actual gameplay is 9/10, with you being rewarded for doing different stuff and having fun instead of mashing same few moves.\n\nWhat is wrong is bad tutorial which led to about 2  hours of sadness and getting rekt, before i could figure out how some things worked. But after it? Fun unbound! Balanced 'ladder' curve, amazing 2v2 matches (single most fun mode for me, lobbing stairs at ring while running around and being an assohle without being disqualified was amazing run in smack a dude run off.)\n\nWhat also is lacking is interactions with people outside of the ring, press conferences, photoshoots with fans, hanging out with other pros and having a good time, that kinda thing. It doesnt need to be mandatory, just for those who are willing. Because for me it would mean a better immersion = higher game quality.\nSome music playing during the actual fights would be great, aswell as effects like fire, fireworks, smoke or whatever just as cosmetical stuff to spice things up and accentiate some of the more solid smacks : )\n\nMaybe its my current 38 C  body temperature speaking, but i had a lot of fun in this game.

This means less locking-up and more in your face fast pace action and less move to be assigned during character creation.  Chain wrestling is cool, but slows down the gameplay.\nIf you have played the old WWE games you would feel a very lackluster amount of customization options. If you have played the game on the next gen consoles, then you are basically getting the exact same game, and if you are expecting a smoother experience because it's running on a PC then i am afraid i have got some bad news. The port isn't too great. I'm getting massive amounts of Lag on my Asus G550 that can run most games on High without many problems. The DLC just arrived, so that'll probably add some hours of gameplay.\nSO\nIf you want the game for the sake of gameplay and fighting mechanics, then grab this game.\nIf you want the game for the downright crazy levels of customization in WWE game and the ability to shape the world of the WWE universe in your vision then you probably want to get an earlier title HOWEVER i would still recommend this game to anyone who is a a wrestlng fan because at the very least it still offers fun gameplay","June 3, 2015","true","91.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Thats all thats really good..ls some new $***, now for the cons\nThey still havent changed all the things that we have complained about, such as\nNew clothing for custom superstars, and new entrances. They used to have some templates, but have taken them out, and left us with an inconsiderate **** who talks on the phone while walking on stage like he is the purple guy.\nWWE Universe is a little clunky, and if you're hoping to become the next big thing with your created superstar, you will have to force some matches, because if you dont, you will be discarded like a piece of trash.\nFrom what ive heard about Career mode, is that it sucks...Not much else to say.\nIf youre playing on a rather "cheap" PC, dont bother. I have the recomended requirements, and all graphics and audience taken out, and it sill lags at some parts, plus, the gameplay is methodically slow.\nAnd lastly, the gameplay is poop.\nIll leave on a rather "stinky" note\n","June 20, 2015","false","98.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Oh my word. I can't even.\n-Overall controls make no sense whatsoever.\n-Bizarre limitations in character creation (which should be a cornerstone for a PC game)\n-D+ overall grade\n\nWelcome to PC, WWE. You earn no points and may God have mercy on your soul.\n\nI am a die-hard, long-time WWE/WWF/professional wrestling fan. I am also an avid but admittedly casual gamer. My favorite wrestling games are still the AKI-produced games of the late 1990s/early 2000s, especially Wrestlemania 2000 and WWF No Mercy. Simple, clean combat systems, easy-to-comprehend controls, fun for all.\n\nWWE 2K16 is a nightmare of quirky and nonsenical controls combined with a horrible PC port. First of all, how can a PC game have NO SUPPORT FOR STEAM CONTROLLER WHATSOEVER? The game recognizes the Steam Controller only as a keyboard input. I can't learn how to play your game when you are demanding I press "Q" on a contoller with no Q button.\n\nThe match mechanics are nonsensical. Kicking out of a pinfall--ANY pinfall--is modeled after the old Madden field goal system: you have to stop a moving target. It's just stupid. No wrestling game should ever put you at peril of a pinfall after the first danged move.\n\nThere are positives but I am scared that if I list them you will actually buy this terrible, horrible, no good, very bad game.\n\nWWE, step up your game or nobody is buying this trash on PC except on a 99 cent mega-sale.","January 22","false","65.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naskoguitar/recommended/240460/","naskoguitar","🍌Faust🎸","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naskoguitar/","148 products in account","I'll start by saying this, I'm a very big fan of the WWE/WWF video games and of the Attitude Era, so I was very excited when I learned that finally a WWE game would hit the PC platform. As most of us, PC folk, I've spent countless hours fiddling around with emulators, and was very disappointed when back in 2010 WWE SmackDown vs Raw Online was cancelled. All this, however, changed in April of this year, when our prayers were heared and we received WWE 2K15 !\n\nSo, what did we receive ? We received a port of the PS4 version from last year, along with all the bugs, some of which were gamebreakers, and the awful FPS issue. It is worth mentioning that most of them were fixed by the devs and that they provided us with all the DLCs for free, which makes up for the initial problems, in my opinion.\n\nGraphically the game shines ! All the wrestlers are very detailed down to the veins in their ears, almost everything has been redone. The engine has been improved and this year we've gotten a more realistic approach. Previous games were more arcady and the sudden change may not appeal to all!\n\nGameplay has been significantly slowed down, it isn't as fast-paced as before. Throughout the match you can feel how the wrestlers lose their strength. Each punch brings them closer to the ground, many times your wrestler will collapse right after performing his finisher. Luckily this new stamina feature can be toned down. A new mini game has also been featured. It can be initiated in the first few minutes of the match and consists of a few strategical chain grapples, giving your wrestler an advantage if completed properly. Sadly the new physics system is mostly broken. Weapons refuse to stay in the ring, and the ladders have become mostly useless. Breaking them is almost impossible and no longer are you able to stack them in the corner.\n\nWWE 2K15's roster feels very lacking compared to recent predecessors. Many wrestlers from past years are nowhere to be found, and most of the unlockables are either different attires or different versions of the same wrestler. Even worse is the new create-a-wrestler. Two-third of this feature has been completely stripped off, including the create-a-diva section. Missing are also: create-a-finisher, backstage brawls, other match variations, many weapons(crutch, guitar, trashcan) and environmental/total control grapples.\n\nStorywise WWE 2K15 features a new MyCareer mode, Universe mode and 2K Showcase mode. The 2K Showcase mode is the meat on the bone this year. It acts as a history lesson on the Triple H/Shawn Michaels and CM Punk/John Cena feuds, allowing the player to experience the iconic matches in a new way. The new MyCareer mode, however, is just worth skipping, because it ends up being too dull and unrewarding.\n\nSo after all this time criticizing this game, why am I giving it a thumbs up ? Like many of us, I want to see the WWE 2K franchise return to the PC platform. This game is far from perfect, but still managed to provide me with some fun moments. I do recommend that you get it, but first be prepared to have to part with some key features!\n\nFinal verdict: 6.5/10 ! :]\n\nPS: I am aware of the new installment WWE 2K16. I think that the developers have done a better job this time, and have really listened to their fans. Even though the same problems with the physics still seem to remain, this year's game is a big improvement. I may review it in the future, if it ever gets released on PC!","December 2, 2015","true","46.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I  am a HUGE fan of wrestling as entertainment and I actually had a lot of fun playing this game with my friend. However there is just sooooo many issues with the game (that will not be fixed) that I have had to give it a negative review.\n\nThe game crashes on a regular basis for no reason, after trying to swap around allocated ram to sort the problem out I found no avail. Now I would give the benefit of a doubt to the devs to patch this, however the game is now a year old and with the new wwe game out on consoles I doubt that the devs will return to fix this cash cow. Now that is only the cream of the cake as there is no mouse optimisation! What?! How?! Why is there a game on PC without mouse controls in the menu?! I didnt buy a keyboard and MOUSE to have the mosue sit there as a colourful paperweight! You have to use eathier the arrow keys or the wasd keys to navigate through the menu, which is fustrating as all hell!\n\nI could look past all these issues if the game didnt lack content that has been there since wwe raw vs smackdown on the ps2! Wrestlers, arenas and match types are just blatenly missing, obviously cut out to meet the release date set by WWE. The grahical options are limited at best, with AA only up to 8x and no ultra graphical setting to be found. Also a note TAA does not exist in this game, sorry budget end users. Ofcourse though, they add these wrestlers, arenas and match types back in as DLC! Thanks for costing people money, then demmand that they pay more for the other chunk of content the devs hid behind a pay wall for sad lonely, desperate people like me, who really wanted a wwe game on pc to buy up.\n\nNow for some positives for this mess of a game. There are two single player story modes. the John cena vs CM Punk feud and the Shawn Michaels vs Triple H feud. I am glad to say that bouth of these were really enjoyable. I enjoyed the doccumentary style cutscenes with a narrator hyping the matches, that was awsome. I also enjoyed how accurate the feuds were to real life. Personally I enjoyed the Shawn Michaels vs Triple H feud better......but maybe thats only because Shawn Michaels (AKA. The HeatBreak Kid) is my favourite wrestler of all time. But the John cena vs CM Punk feaud was good as well.....even if CM Punk looks a bit crooked.\n\nOverall the game seems to be an up and down expirience for the player. You want to enjnoy the game because its fun and you are releived to finally be playing a wrestling game, however all the technical issues and issues regarding the games lack of content can not be looked over this time.\n\n4.5/10 "Technical Issues Hurt The Gameplay" -Joshua Upham\n"Cynical Redubs Since 2013"\n\nWant more AWSOME reviews?

As much as I'd wanted to, it's impossible to recommend this thing.\nThe servers are constantly down for days, even though they are only supposed to be down near May 2016, MyCareer is my favourite thing and it is just lazy as hell and has, literally, 0 depth to it, and so on and so on.\nGod, is this bad. As NXT Champion, I have to defend the title EVERY SINGLE WEEK, and after about 3 defenses there comes a time where all you opponents are suddenly overpowered and it takes AGES to beat them. I get that if you're champion for a while, the game should make it harder for you to remain that way. I don't really think that overpowering your opponent in every way possible, instead of just increasing the reversal rate, for instance, is the way to do it. As soon as you lose the championship, tho, all those opponents are easilly beatable within 4-5 minutes. Ex: 10 minute match against Unbeatable Xavier Woods while champion --- 3 minute match with Beatable Ziggler while not.\nHave I mentioned how this is supposed to be as real as the real WWE? Well, I don't remember anyone having to defend the NXT Championship for 7 weeks in a row. Nor do I remember anyone being able to choose wether he wanted to defend the title on the 8th week or not, choosing not to, and being stripped out of the championship.\n\nIt's a f***ing mess. So much for the return of wrestling to PC.\n\nTry again.\n\nEDIT: I almost forgot to mention that my farewell match at Wrestlemania, after about 6 years in the company, was against a Random Character that had never been seen or mentioned before in this game. I can't believe I forgot to mention tha- oh wait, it's just so bad you can't keep track.","October 17, 2015","false","102.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

But after it? Fun unbound! Balanced 'ladder' curve, amazing 2v2 matches (single most fun mode for me, lobbing stairs at ring while running around and being an assohle without being disqualified was amazing run in smack a dude run off.)\n\nWhat also is lacking is interactions with people outside of the ring, press conferences, photoshoots with fans, hanging out with other pros and having a good time, that kinda thing. It doesnt need to be mandatory, just for those who are willing. Because for me it would mean a better immersion = higher game quality.\nSome music playing during the actual fights would be great, aswell as effects like fire, fireworks, smoke or whatever just as cosmetical stuff to spice things up and accentiate some of the more solid smacks : )\n\nMaybe its my current 38 C  body temperature speaking, but i had a lot of fun in this game.

Being used to controls from the consoles, getting used to the keyboard controls was no easy task, since they are not even close to how a controller is, and more complex than MDickie's controls for his games. However, this game although stripped of a lot of what WWE 2K14 was, it still handles as a good WWE game.\n\nThe glitches I've seen in this game in videos, like the glitchy ring in the Redbox Replay moments are nonexistant for me and I haven't encountered any noticable bugs so far (of course at time of this review I haven't played much). I came in expecting a ♥♥♥♥ poor port, but the port is better than I expected and I'm satisfied.\n\nThe MyCareer mode is similar to a Career mode I remember from an old SvR game (07 I believe it was) where you try and bring your character to the top. Honestly a real refreshment from the WWE Universe mode where I try and bring a custom superstar to Raw and try and make him Champion.\n\nThis port is obviously not the best port in the world but I'd it a 6/10 due to it missing some matches that I do hold dear to my heart like the Inferno match and the removal of the Create an Arena option and the Create a Titantron Video. I'd honestly wait to see what 2K16 has to offer before picking this up if it ever gets a PC release (which I realllyyy hope it does)","June 27, 2015","true","20.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Still only 25 caw slots like on nextgen consoles. I'm sure people will find ways to mod the game by twerking the .pac files in the game folders and do a lot of cool stuff, but it probably isn't worth it seeing how 2k16 will be out in about six months right now. I myself run an e-fed league on Twitch (have been since 2008) and might dabble in this to try and edit some stuff  in the game's folders but I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who was hopefully looking for something new and better in terms of modding and customizing unless you really want to dig into the game's files and start messing around with .pac files.\n\nIf you don't care about any of that and just want to play the game for what it is and enjoy rasslin' with today's WWE wrestlers, then go for it, the graphics are pretty and the Universe mode is really fun to do. MyCareer can be fun and the online parts of the game (matches/custom) works well from what I tested it so far on release day.","April 28, 2015","true","0.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockholiday/recommended/240460/","rockholiday","Rock Holiday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockholiday/","568 products in account","I wanted to love this game.  I REALLY wanted to.  At current time, I cannot really recommend spending anywhere NEAR full price for this game.  Even for a crazy wrestling fan like me who has wanted a PC wrestling game since time immemorial it would seem, this was a disappointment.  I had heard of bugs, and features being a little bare in the console version of the game, and it's true there's a lot less here than there was in 2k14, with the exception of a couple of new modes like Career and Showcase.\n\nI would find this backstep completely forgiveable except for one major thing:  Performance.  Bear in mind, some or all of these issues may be a case by case thing and you may have better results.  Overall, it runs okay, but with some notable problems:\n\n- The ring and ropes are often blacked out, as if missing their textures.  Restarting the game usually fixes this.\n- Sometimes when I launch the game, the launcher gets stuck in some kind of loop, restarting itself over and over until I exit Steam and restart it.  This broadcasts that you're playing WWE 2k15 to all your friends, over and over.\n- Some of the load times are HORRENDOUS.  They are especially noticeable when I'm customizing my wrestler, and it takes all day to load up an elbow pad or something to customize.\n- Game takes a while to start up, and does some weird stuff like start minimized, then come up windowed, then go fullscreen, then window itself again, then eventually correct itself.  Weird.\n- Something feels off about the gameplay itself.  It doesn't seem to flow quite right.  Like maybe there's a little bit of lag but not enough to be glaringly obvious.  Not sure what this is.\n\nThose are the primary things that come to mind, and I'll edit this if anything else major comes up.  Conversely, I'll update if any of this gets fixed.\n\nOn to the feature problems:\n- Very few performance options in the launcher, almost no effect on my game so far\n- No custom music\n- Speaking of music, there's not a large selection that plays during gameplay, and it gets old really fast.  Can just mute and play something in the background though I guess.\n- You can't create a female wrestler.  At all.\n- Not as good a roster as '14.  Maybe I'm just spoiled.\n- Less customization options all around.  DRASTICALLY so.\n- Lots less match types and options.\n- No Paige\n\nIt's not all bad though.  Some of the things I like:\n- MODDABLE!!!  This means a lot of custom content, AND may mean fixes to various problems if they aren't patched!\n- All DLC from the console version is coming for free (except for Paige, it seems)\n- the Career mode seems really neat.  I haven't gotten far in it due to impatience with some of the loading and the previously mentioned lack of fluidity in the gameplay\n- Some of the newer grappling mechanics seem alright, but maybe it's TOO much.  I'll leave it as a positive for now.\n- It is the first WWE game (perhaps wrestling game at all) on PC in a very very long time.  So it's something.\n\nOverall, I'm going to say don't buy this unless it's on a good sale.  Even if you're a die hard fan like I am.  I think the problems are equal parts with the game itself and with the port version as well.\nHOPEFULLY '16 will be better and we'll get it on PC, as well.

My career is a joke, only feuds around one of three or four pay-per-views you pick, the rest are just matches against the same 7-10 wrestlers and 1-3 pre-built CAW's. Universe is the same here as in absolutely every other game, glitches abound ranging from rope problems, to Smackdown being held in Unknown, to the cage not rendering so your characters escape from an open ring by climbing the air. Mods may save this game but that's the only way it will really happen.","May 14, 2015","false","37.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But If you really, really want it, wait till it's atleast -75% because YUKE's/2K do not deserve your money for this shameful attempt of a wrestling game. WWE 2K15 might be one of the worst wrestling games I've played (and I've played a lot of them) and it's far from the glory days of No Mercy on N64 or even WWF Attitude on the original Playstation, or FPW series on GBA.\n\nAs of this moment you can't even enable blood on the career mode or even change the DIFFICULTY of the game! Not only that, the career mode ENDS when you win the Heavyweight Championship on RAW. Sometimes the storylines just suddenly drop without any resolution or you might end up facing the same wrestler 5 times out of 6 in the worst of times. The AI isn't all that bright either, I've seen some extremely dumb stuff, especially in tag matches.\n\nThe CAW -mode is lacking huge amounts of stuff, ranging from clothes, masks, facepaints etc., and even if it did have those, creating your wrestler is a pain in the ♥♥♥ due to the ridicolous loading times. I have an amazing computer and whenever I add or remove a part, no matter what it is, there's multiple seconds before the game is done loading, even when I've had the game installed on SSD. Simply unacceptable, creating your own CAW takes 35 to 45 minutes (or more) just because of the loading times. Horrible port.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME. Make 2K realise that they have to step up in order for us to buy and play their games. When I first heard that this game was coming to PC I was thrilled, since the last wrestling game had been the WWE RAW series almost a decade ago. I don't usually preorder but on this case I did and man was I disappointed. 2/10. Saddened that the Steam refund hadn't been updated back when I bought this piece of ♥♥♥♥ of a game.","June 19, 2015","false","23.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I was still able to make a goofy character, but there's a lack of body types, and a lack of female customs altogether.\n\nIf you're playing a female you can only fight other females, so essentially there's only 6 or so possible opponents. You can't do a career with a female character either.\n\nThis game runs really unnecessarily slow. I realize I don't meet the requirements but when only two models are on the screen, all the audience is taken out, and the game res is downsized I don't expect to be averaging 10fps either.\n\nAll that being said the roster is fairly big and there's a lot of customization items if you're willing to play that far.","July 14, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

With the introduction of stamina management, chain wrestling and momentum buildup, this game takes a huge step towards making the flow of a match more realistic whereas in older games you could just spam the same move 10 times in a row without any repercussions. So more realism, less arcade.\n\nIt is essentially a great game, but you have to cope with the removal of a lot of the standout modes from previous iterations like the story creator or the move editor. It feels like most of the developement time was spent on porting the game over to the new improved next gen engine, so a lot of those side features got kicked out, I really hope they make a comeback in 2K16, they are a major draw to the series and have provided some awesome community content (like VGCW on Twitch). Also the online modes are missing entrances which really sucks, hope they bring that back! Also at this point the roster feels super antiquated, so much has changed since they closed the deadline, yet you still have Seth Rollins and Dean Ambrose fighting for the Shield or Cody Rhodes as... Cody Rhodes and not Stardust.\n\nThe PC Port is alright alltho done with not much effort, it runs fine and there are some barebones options to tweak performance.\n\nThe PC version comes with all the DLC that got released on the console versions including the three additional Showcase storylines. It is a great mode in theory but ultimately I think all the storylines they chose this year were pretty lame and if youre really a wrestling fan you will wonder why they chose such irrelevant feuds to begin with and not something cooler.\n\nIt's alright, it's mainly for wrestling fans obviously but if you want to get into it, it's very accessible to new players especially thanks to the gameplay improvements.\n\nBAH GAWD","June 24, 2015","true","31.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I bought this game on sale for $13, All DLC included. I remember being borderline obsessed with every wwf/wwe game that came out for playstation and ps2 as well as S. vs R. 2009. The old games were actually FUN, I even played them after my teenage self stopped watching wrestling. Anyway, This game looks gorgeous and 2K has an excellent rep. So I bought the game preparing for a blast of nostalgia. The game features many modes and an insane amount of customizable character options. It actually feels more like your playing one of their sports games. BUT the mechanics just don't work! The reversal/counter system is rediculous, the controls are choppy. There is a silly feature that plays almost like Rock, paper, scissors for grapples... And there was a glitch in changing the difficulty settings in certain modes. I gave it three hours thinking I would get used to everything, and when it would seem like I was destroying my opponent, he would pin me. No matter how much strength/stamina you have there is a bar with a press and release timed system, It is too fast at times and I lost matches with almost full health. Thanks for my first ever refund steam :) You rock.","February 20","false","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I usually love playing wrestling games but this one is terrible.  you cant turn blood on in my career and if you wanna turn off the stupid camera cuts, replays, and the stupid logo you have to do it everytime you get in a match (my career mode).  You also cant change the difficulty in my career as well.  You wanna play some stupid mini game everytime you go to grapple someone in where you play paper rock scissors with the ai and then rotate your analog stick "to find the hotspot".  how bout you let me bodyslam someone and get your trash mini-game outta her.  clunky movement simulator as well.  it literally takes a full second before your guy will start moving when you move your analog stick.  everytime you wanna drag someone your guy will completely walk on the other side of the guy your trying to pick up.  also did you wanna hit the ref everytime you jump from the top rope because he runs in front of you and the targetting system makes you hit him instead of the guy you are fighting.  also character creation is less robust as it used to be.  body morphing is terrible.  you wanna make a fat guy well he's still buff.  oh you wanna be as ripped and buff as the ultimate warrior or tommy wall well to bad.  the best thing is when you are in a fatal 3 way and someone is getting pinned and you try to run back into the ring but instead your guy just stands at the edge of the ring and does nothing.  i cant even count how many times ive been screwed over in matches due to a buggy experience.  hey wanna submit a guy quickly (holds A down and picks guy up instead of doing a submission move)","June 21, 2015","false","26.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Now though, I do love this franchise (but don't watch the show anymore, just the games) but I'm not going to be bias/untruthful. With that being said, lets go to the pros.\n\nPROS:\n1. New Roster for Recent new wrestlers\n2. They re-added a somewhat story mode (Career Mode) for created wrestlers.\n3. Its on PC. (Sorry, but it is the only WWE game for PC LITERALLY)\n\nNow time to roast this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nCons:\n1. ONLINE MATCHMAKING IS ♥♥♥! When I say this, I'm not saying you can't play online, but the way to do so is so confusing and complicated. you go online, select your favorite wrestlers (Male and Diva), favorite arena and prefered matches (ranks, casual, type of match, etc.) and from then on you simply wait. I feel as though there should have been a button or even a selection to go search for matches, plus there really aren't that many people online in the first place, so its going to take forever to find a match.\n2. Customization Selection is weak. You used to have a wider variety to pick when It came to clothing, hair, and facial hair for a character (being the casual black man I am, I usually get a buzz cut or braids and neither were available. The best hair they had for my character was dreads, so I pretty much had a kick-boxing Chief Keef).\n3. WTF Finishers. There have been multiple time where I was charging a finisher and my opponent just simply wouldn't get up. Or the on TOO MANY occasions where my signature would be the spear from the corner, the opponent gets up, I run for the spear, I touch him, but it doesn't land, and my signature gone. Or even worst, where I had a finisher hit on me by an AI and we both froze (at the time, this was a fatal 4 match) and WE ♥♥♥♥ING LOST BECAUSE OF IT. Fix that ♥♥♥♥ man.\n4.Did I mention the customization was weak. I'm sorry if I'm repeating, but you gotta understand that the character creation is the reason why majority of people buy the game, and its weak AF! Even the cool designs they used to have are gone, though a few are left. Also, its PC, why THE LITERAL ♥♥♥♥ is it so hard to make it able to put your own music into your entrance, like come on.\n5. Career Mode is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. I pretty much won majority ( and a high majority at that) of my matches. Even the ones that had me in the ring with 4 people, but I digress. And for the majority, I was the Heel. Luckily, I read in a community Guide that there were a lot of things I wasn't suppose to do, So i would check that out before getting into career mode. Also, after I won the WWE Championship, it pushes ahead 10 years, And I'm retiring automatically. WTF?!?! I didn't even have the belt anymore, are you telling me I did all that, just to hold that belt for about 2 seconds just to fast foward my way out of it. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n6. 60 FPS Lock. IDK why, but its there and its obvious. Though, not a huge con, I've seen fram dips and I know for a fact my PC can run this game like a champ. <<< See what I did there XD\n\nFinal Verdict:\n$50!?!?! Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me?!?!?! Catch it on sale or just wait for the price drop, i got it for about $15. And though it wasn't $50, I'm honestly not satisfied that I got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ product. If you not a wrestling fan, don't even think about buying this ♥♥♥♥.","October 8, 2015","false","49.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It was clearly the best part of the game, and yet there isn't even a vestige of it left.

The lack of female CAWs and the general lack of options makes for a disappointing experience.  The modding community seems to be pretty good, however, even if you add 50 wrestlers to the about 75 you can play, the game is still no where near fun to play.\n\nFor me, I'm more of a WCW vs. NWO: World Tour kind of guy than this kind of reversal, button-masher of a game in WWE 2K15.  It seems as if too much of fighting is simply pressing the reversal button at the right time, or messing with the silly endless grapples, and if you aren't great at that, you can get locked in a loop of damage.  You seem to fall to the mat and stay there for the most simple of hits, allowing your opponent too much of an advantage and vice versa if you get too far ahead yourself.  It makes for frustrating gameplay.\n\nThe graphics aren't that great, especially the walking movements of the characters, which feels especially stiff and awkward during player introductions.  The announcing leaves you with moments of silence that feel awkward.  The end game highlights are reintroduced as "highlights" every time a new highlight is shown, as if you forgot you're watching...highlights.  This game is really as bad as everyone has said it is.\n\nI decided to get WWE 2K15 for the sale, but even at $17 it feels like a rip off.  There are a ton of cool wrestlers and things to unlock, and tons of cool mods to look through, but the fighting system is fairly awful.  I'll give it a little more time just to experience the different modes, but I think I'll hold off on considering a PC wrestling game for awhile after this experience.","July 25, 2015","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I have been playing WWE games on my PlayStation 1 and 2 for thousands of hours and have not been tired of it. The newer WWE games were the only reason why I wanted to purchase the newer consoles but I just derived satisfaction from games like SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain, which still remains as the best WWE game to date. WWE 2K15 was a game that recieved a scathing critic score because of its lack of content and therefore I believe WWE and 2K found it wise to port it to the PC (As we are second rate consumers, after all). But hey, I still got happy as a baby when I found out I will be able to play a recent WWE iteration without having to buy a console. After purchasing and playing the game for a considerable period of time (As you can see), I would say this game is well worth a purchase at a discount. The graphics are a massive improvement over the previous games, though some wrestlers look hideous, but that they always did. Triple H for instance has been done well for the first time as Yukes always found it difficult to model his face in the previous iterations. The gameplay is responsive and enjoyable, but the reversal system has been made extremely frustrating as you are bound to be "Too late" or "Too fast" with your response, which is quite stupid if you ask me. The roster is laughable at best but the added DLC's kinda make up for it. I for instance only cared for a few wrestlers I love playing as, and all of them are there in the game (A WWE game without Stone Cold/Kane/Undertaker/The Rock is not a WWE game). I also found a distinct lack of environments as all action is at the ring side. I loved the vivid backstage locations in SmackDown! Here Comes the Pain and was gutted to see 2K/Yukes not bother to add them in this iteration despite the big 30GB download size.","May 2","true","107.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

While it is mediocre compared to older games on consoles in it's plain form, client-side modifications make the game the definite edition and pretty good, as the community is constantly updating wrestlers, adding new attires, there are tools to change entrance music, titantron videos, all NPCs (like the Rosebud called Bunny) can be unlocked and the modding community has just begun actually adding new wrestlers to the roster as well instead of just replacing them. The game hasn't been out for long, thus there are likely much better things to come.\n\nThe PC version also has more CAW slots than the console counterpart and also comes with some updated Titantrons since the DLC.\n\nThe price is nice, especially during sales, as the game comes with all DLC (except Paige - but the modding community is close to release Paige that looks even better than the Xbox One/PS4 version of Paige as well) for free.\n\nGameplay is at a slower pace and more timing-based than it's console-exclusive predecessors. At first it's a bit tricky to adapt, but once you have played it a bit, you'll notice that it feels alot more like a wrestling simulation than most of the more arcady predecessors.\n\nThe game modes are all entertaining. The wonderful 2k Showcases which allow you to replay famous feuds and careers of the past, over the enjoyable My Career mode where your friends' career mode wrestlers can invade, to the customizable WWE Universe mode which allows you to manage rosters, book shows and play as well as the obligatory exhibition mode (which is a bit limited in match types - however, more can already be unlocked via trainers and memory editing).\n\nOnline Multiplayer isn't all that exciting and matchmaking is rather awkward, the game is best played with 1-6 players locally.\n\nWhile the game supports keyboard controls, it's highly recommended to use a gamepad like the Xbox One, Xbox 360 or DualShock 4 Controller (with DS4Windows to emulate an Xbox controller for Windows) as it's just alot more intuitive and easier to play that way. The game supports up to 6+ input devices in total, so 6 players can play locally (6 wrestlers on screen at once are the maximum, hence the limit), just like on the Xbox One (The PS4 version only supports 4 players as the console only supports 4 controllers at once).\n\nThe roster is pretty large and most big names are in it. With the DLC it also has a good mix of current wrestlers and legends, although some of the wrestlers that became stars after the game was originally released are not in it. But you can either download mods to add them, download CAWs and updated attires from community creations and more, so most of the current fan-favorites (from NXT, for example) can be added to the game one way or the other.\n\nNote that the game is quite hardware-hungry, however. So you better meet the minimum or better, recommended requirements. A beefy multi-core CPU, 4+GB of RAM, and a higher mid-class video card with at least 2GB of memory and a fast HDD or better, an SSD to run the game from are a must.\n\nWWE 2k15 doesn't have any profiles in Nvidia or AMD video card drivers (I guess 2k didn't want to pay them to include them and neither Nvidia nor AMD can be ar$ed to add support for games from publishers that don't sponsor them). Thus SLI and CrossfireX don't work out of the box. One has to create their own profiles for it, but once they are made, multi-GPU setups scale really well and increas performance immensely.\nNvidia SLI users will want to use Nvidia Inspector to set SLI Compatibility bits (DX1x) to 0x000025F5 (alternatively 0x000015F5 that seems to work better if you have a lower-end SLI system), while AMD CrossfireX users will want to create a custom Profile for the game in Catalyst Control center and force CrossfireX Mode to the "AFR friendly" setting.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend WWE 2k15 to every wrestling fan with the hardware that can run it, even if you already own it on consoles, as the PC version is simply better due to small improvements as well as modifications.","June 21, 2015","true","445.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You will be disappointed. I will go with pros and cons and start with cons first.\n\nCONS:\n-MINI-GAMES???? Holy hell. I just wanted to get in the ring and fight. I wanted to throw down some awesome body slams and power bombs, maybe irish whip a fool and then clothesline him. Guess what....you have to play some terrible mini-game to pull off moves and maybe that could work, but these games suck. You are not going to go in the ring and grab your opponent and do an awesome move, so get that out of your head. This alone right here should make you stop and say NO, not going to buy it.\n-CLUNKY....everything is clunky. This plays like a terrible PC port because that is what it is. Every control from superstar creation to in ring game play is awkward and clumsy to the extreme to the point of being near unplayable.\n-Limited Creative Options - love making your own superstar with awesome moves and entrance? You will get only about half that experience here and be angry in the end for it.\n-IT JUST WAS NOT FUN - and because of all the things above and more.....the game just wasn't fun. Got my refund and regretted ever buying it.\n\nPROS:\n-It's a wrestling game on PC. And we've been wanting one for a while. Just not this one.\n-Nice Roster with some blasts from the past.\n-Graphics --this is actually a very beautiful game. Maybe not perfect, but surely it gives a 'next generation' vibe.\n*that's about it for PROS. A nice roster and it looks nice.

It does this in many, many ways. Firstly, the story mode has no flavor to it. It's mostly grinding social media followers by doing token matches to advance through the story and get to the real meat and potatoes (or just potatoes if you're vegan) of the game, getting a title shot. There are a LOT of different moves to use (pretty much 4 for almost every thinkable position a superstar can be in in relation to another superstar) and they give you a TON of different moves to chose from, but trying to remember all those moves that you picked and which situation to use them in is very difficult for the average player. You end up mostly just sticking to some tried and true moves that you can remember easily, which the game penalizes you for in Skill Points (SP) for lacking "variety" during the match. The engine is REALLY nice with very photorealistic versions of many superstars and several fails on others (The Miz was one that stood out as a bad model) but even on computers that are running well above the recommended stats, you're chugging and you have to pause/unpause the game to get some relief. At its core, it's still a fairly fun games in bursts and having a friend's created superstar be matched against you in a PPV match in your story mode is pretty awesome!\n\nPros Great engine\nLots of moves to pick from\n"Invading" friends is a lot of fun!\nStill fun in bursts\nCons Poorly optimized even on high-end PCs\nStory mode is slow and grindy\nControls are really awkward and hard to remember\nA little too much realism interferes with creation/combat\nFinal RecommendationBuy it on sale (at least 33%, better at 50%+). You get all the DLC for free and if you have friends who play, then send over your superstars to interfere with their grindy story and liven things up!","June 18, 2015","false","11.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

So, of course I bought WWE 2k15 for XBox 360 when it came out only to have my tiny heart broken.\n\nI was really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThen I heard it was being released for PC and I think I had to throw away the underwear I was wearing that day. HOWEVER! I read a bunch of reviews when it came out saying how terrible it is and that one might as well wait for 2K16 instead. So, I changed my mind and decided maybe that was the best idea.\n\nThen the game was on sale and really tempting me, so I read some reviews again. This time I saw something different. I saw people saying that even if this version of the game isn't good (and many said it was terrible) that we need to support it to show the developers that there is an audience on PC that will buy the game. One guy said "I'll eat ♥♥♥♥ today so that tommorrow I may eat steak". I wouldn't call this game ♥♥♥♥ though, I actually really like it, and although it has it's fair share of shortcommings I will gladly support even THE IDEA of having wrestling games on PC.\n\nTo be honest, most of my console days are in the past, and I have been a happy PC gamer for many moons, and I would much much MUCH rather have my favorite games on PC than console. I honestly can't think of a game that I would rather have on console than PC.\n\nIn short, I recommend this game if you want to show that WE THE PEOPLE want WWE PC games. I think it's fun too, and I've sunk at least a few hours into it that I don't regret, and I'm not close to done with it yet.","June 30, 2015","true","32.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Everything in this game is outdated and the customization is a bit lax.  You can import your own logos and faces through 2K's Import feature and finally change the attire of every single person in game....but custom music has been removed.\n\nI say that WWE 2k15 is a right that has corrected a wrong....with experience, because with the addition to PC you can change almost every aspect of the game with the help of mods.  There are some beautiful mods out there for this game and even greater changes coming soon.  Adding new titantrons, new character skins, and new belt designs are a breeze, but the methods to change minitron/walltrons is a pain.  There also isn't any additional space for added trons meaning that you have to overwrite already established ones.\n\nGameplay wise, you have to have a pretty decent gaming rig to run the game, there are low res programs to help run the game on low end computers but it's like playing WWE on Playstation 2.  There is still a bit of lag but having owned the xbox and xbox one version of the game, it's a bit faster response compared to those consoles.\n\nOverall, I recommend the game for the die hard WWE fan, with a few corrections you can have fun playing the game and it will sustain you until WWE 2K16 releases.

While it is mediocre compared to older games on consoles in it's plain form, client-side modifications make the game the definite edition and pretty good, as the community is constantly updating wrestlers, adding new attires, there are tools to change entrance music, titantron videos, all NPCs (like the Rosebud called Bunny) can be unlocked and the modding community has just begun actually adding new wrestlers to the roster as well instead of just replacing them. The game hasn't been out for long, thus there are likely much better things to come.\n\nThe PC version also has more CAW slots than the console counterpart and also comes with some updated Titantrons since the DLC.\n\nThe price is nice, especially during sales, as the game comes with all DLC (except Paige - but the modding community is close to release Paige that looks even better than the Xbox One/PS4 version of Paige as well) for free.\n\nGameplay is at a slower pace and more timing-based than it's console-exclusive predecessors. At first it's a bit tricky to adapt, but once you have played it a bit, you'll notice that it feels alot more like a wrestling simulation than most of the more arcady predecessors.\n\nThe game modes are all entertaining. The wonderful 2k Showcases which allow you to replay famous feuds and careers of the past, over the enjoyable My Career mode where your friends' career mode wrestlers can invade, to the customizable WWE Universe mode which allows you to manage rosters, book shows and play as well as the obligatory exhibition mode (which is a bit limited in match types - however, more can already be unlocked via trainers and memory editing).\n\nOnline Multiplayer isn't all that exciting and matchmaking is rather awkward, the game is best played with 1-6 players locally.\n\nWhile the game supports keyboard controls, it's highly recommended to use a gamepad like the Xbox One, Xbox 360 or DualShock 4 Controller (with DS4Windows to emulate an Xbox controller for Windows) as it's just alot more intuitive and easier to play that way. The game supports up to 6+ input devices in total, so 6 players can play locally (6 wrestlers on screen at once are the maximum, hence the limit), just like on the Xbox One (The PS4 version only supports 4 players as the console only supports 4 controllers at once).\n\nThe roster is pretty large and most big names are in it. With the DLC it also has a good mix of current wrestlers and legends, although some of the wrestlers that became stars after the game was originally released are not in it. But you can either download mods to add them, download CAWs and updated attires from community creations and more, so most of the current fan-favorites (from NXT, for example) can be added to the game one way or the other.\n\nNote that the game is quite hardware-hungry, however. So you better meet the minimum or better, recommended requirements. A beefy multi-core CPU, 4+GB of RAM, and a higher mid-class video card with at least 2GB of memory and a fast HDD or better, an SSD to run the game from are a must.\n\nWWE 2k15 doesn't have any profiles in Nvidia or AMD video card drivers (I guess 2k didn't want to pay them to include them and neither Nvidia nor AMD can be ar$ed to add support for games from publishers that don't sponsor them). Thus SLI and CrossfireX don't work out of the box. One has to create their own profiles for it, but once they are made, multi-GPU setups scale really well and increas performance immensely.\nNvidia SLI users will want to use Nvidia Inspector to set SLI Compatibility bits (DX1x) to 0x000025F5 (alternatively 0x000015F5 that seems to work better if you have a lower-end SLI system), while AMD CrossfireX users will want to create a custom Profile for the game in Catalyst Control center and force CrossfireX Mode to the "AFR friendly" setting.\n\nIn any case, I highly recommend WWE 2k15 to every wrestling fan with the hardware that can run it, even if you already own it on consoles, as the PC version is simply better due to small improvements as well as modifications.","June 21, 2015","true","445.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Well, yes and no..\n\nFirst lets start with the YES YES YES!!! (sorry had to throw that in there lol)\n\n*Gameplay*\n\nThe "new" gameplay isn't really all that "new" when compaired to 2k13/14, but it has been updated and improved and really feels more like a real wrestling match.. Basically the controls and attacks are pretty much the same as the previous two games 2k13/14.. But they added a new "grapple" system that the match usually starts with, using a sort of quick time mechanic to attempt to get a hold on your opponent, and then setup a move. Its an ok system, but not a real game changer, and usually only happens within the first few minutes of the match. The real game changer was the addition of a stamina bar for the wrestlers. In the past two games once you got an advantage over your opponent, you could literally just spam moves on him/her without any real penalty. As long as you where good an countering, you could run around like a crazy man and just spam big power moves over and over and over. It made the game a bit unrealistic and to fast paced for wrestling. Now with the new stamina bar, every move you do takes away some stamina, and if you don't pay attention and pace yourself, you can tire yourself out fairly quickly, leaving your wide open to your opponent. You have to be more tactful, and pace yourself and let your stamina rebuild a bit before going for your next move, which in my opinion is more fun, and more realistic to WWE wrestling.\n\n*Graphics*\n\nThe graphics are hit or miss as well with the game. They are very detailed and this is definatly the most realistic looking game to date, and the majority of the male superstars all look very good and close too their real life counterparts. Unfortunatly the same cannot be said for the Diva's. They look.... Strange. Nikki Bella looks like Mark Henry sat on her face and crushed it. And Brie Bellas mouth is so huge it takes up over half her face. I dunno if the artists just aren't good at doing female models, or they just didn't feel like giving the Diva's much time or effort, but they all look pretty bad.\n\n*Sound*\n\nThe crowd chants in this game are really well done, and react well to whats going on in the ring. Pull off a huge power move and the crowed will go nuts. The sound effects are good, and you can even hear some of the superstars talking during thier intros (like John Cena's famous "Time to go to work") are all nice touches. All the superstars intro music are accounted for and done well. Unfortunatly for the menu music, IV GOT SOME BAD NEWS FOR YA! It sucks! Instead of using superstars intro themes, WWE decided to use licensed music from various artists. Crappy pop music, country, rap and rock.. All garbage. If i have to hear that stupid "This is how we roll" song one more damn time my ears will bleed.\n\n*Content*\n\nUnfortunatly this is the bad part of the game. If you have played the previous two games 2k13/14 you probably loved all the customization you could do with CAW (create a wrestler) tons of options and items to use to make your custom superstar your own.. Well this game has hardly any of that. They really stripped it down to bare bones. So basically all custome characters look pretty much the same without much options for costumes, tattoos, hairstyles, ect.. And the face and body morphing to customise your characters facial and body types is really really basic and bad, does not give CAW creators much to work with. The developers even stated that since the game was built from scratch they didn't have much time to add in lots of customisable content, and that 2k16 will have alot more, which in my opinion is just a poor excuse for either lazyness of the devs part, or the fact that WWE forced them to push the game out by a certain date, and they didn't have time to add it.. (probably the latter).. Either way its a sad excuse, and i see no reason why they could not have added it in an update later if they where pressed for time.\n\n*DLC*\n\nWhile its hard to complain about the DLC for the PC version since it was free, but it was also pretty unimpressive. Basically just character packs featuring characters that where on the normal roster in the last games, with a few exceptions, not enough Legends, and the Divas are severly under represented in the game (Diva's get no love)..\n\nSo do i recommend it? Yes and no.. My offical review will say yes i recommend it. It is a really fun game to play, even if it does seriously lack content. So if you can pick it up on sale, i say go for it. But with 2k16 coming to consoles soon, and probably PC 4 to 6 months later, you might just wanna wait for 2k16 to come out. But if your itchen to have some good wrestling fun right now, and don't mind so much the lack of custimization content, and freaky mutant looking Diva's, then pick the game up, you will have fun with it for sure.","August 4, 2015","true","86.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is not as good as 2k13, no mercy, or here comes the pain....but it is a pretty solid wrestling game even though it is missing a few features that past games had. Unlike many that have posted reviews I have come across very little bugs and glitches and to put into perspective I have come across more bugs in games like World of Warcraft and Diablo than I have for this game.","July 30, 2015","true","101.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

One of the best soundtracks ever in a fighting game!\nGraphics are extremly nice! They probably could be better... since svr08 was 7 years ago... but they hold up.\nAnimations are really sluggish... they often feel unrealistic or better stupid... superstars doing 360° walk around a grounded opponent to pin him and then becoming superhuman and laying on him nearly instantly... many animations are just way to fast to compensate for the reversal system...\n\nWhich brings me to:\nGameplay... probably the biggest factor:\nIts really nice! I miss some features of the older games... and trying to target the other tagopponent behind the ropes is A PAIN! I sometimes tried ~1hour to get the doublefinisher omg moment, just because i couldn't get both tag team partners in the ring at the same moment.\nbut superstars interact more realistic with the environment and overall its very solid and fun gameplay.\n\nIf you had a SvR game for Ps2 but never bought the newer consoles... this is the game for you. Maybe wait until its on sale again, but the offline "MyCareer" mode is completly worth on its own.\n\nNow let me tell you the story of my match:\nI had to face r-truth the current tag team champion in a 1-1... I won easily... but next weak i had to face him again. His partner came with a steel chair after me so i started with yellow bodyparts and lower stamina... the match went okay, but it got close once.\nAfter this Vickie just said "oh hey i hope you don't mind im putting you at a 1vs2 tag handicap match have fun with that.\nAnd since my superstar isn't high level this could get some trouble... but after smashing his partner through the announcment table this was a kinda easy match.\nAfter this Vickie said "well since you did so well decide if you want 1v1 2v2 or a 1v2 again at the pvp. I chose the 1v2 since my Devil could handle it (i thought)\nSo i thought to myself "lets do the double FU (i think its called attitude adjustment or something nowadays) it will be fun!"\nohhh the horror! As i wrote earlier:\nits a pain to grab the tag partner that is currently not in the ring. so after i saved three finishers i tried to get both in a corner and failing a lot... 3 of my bodyparts were red when i got hit by two of r-truths finishers and 3 signature moves...\nhow i kicked out? i don't know! last time i kicked out, the bar was like this  | | ... but i kicked out at 2.9 seconds (3rd try)...\nand i finally got the double FU off!\nBut now his partner activated his comeback and got me another finisher... i was broken... i had no chance of hitting | this time... ROPE BREAK! I felt i had only one chance left! Since my Pins after a finisher were broken two times by the tagpartner... i felt now has the time come: i used hells gate! i had the victory for sure! the submission bar was filled! I was in joy all ove...-\nWHAT?!?! R-Truth kicked him out at the very, very last second!\nNow his mate got up before me... tagged with R-Truth... but completly KO only hung in the ropes after the tag. Unable to get a hold of himself.\nI saw my chance! I still had one finisher left inside me! I countered his grab and pushed him down and went for the Hells Gate again! And as i saw the hands of R-Truth hitting the map for submission i knew:\n\nI AM GOING TO RECOMMEND THIS GAME! AND I WILL TELL MY STORY!\n____________________________________________________________\n\nLong story short:\n+graphics |  it looks nice... but could have been better\n+audio | one of the best tracks out there! awesome\n+story mode | finally you can create your own story with your own superstar again\n\n+- gameplay | feels sluggish sometimes... other times really fluent...\n+- quite a lot is missing or has been replaced! for instance: i never know if DQ is on or off... you simply can't look it up in the match itself. but slamming someone through the barricade is SO satisfying!\n\n- console port! i have a very good pc that can play Shadow of Mordor on Ultra without any lags... but i still have to set some options down for it not to lag.\n- it could have been a better game! 7 years after SvR 08... It is still not much, if even, better than the old SvR games...","July 26, 2015","true","102.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have to recommend the game only because it will show 2K that there is a market for a WWE Game on the PC so if they end up putting WWE2K16 on PC it will be done better while the tactic is shady as all hell I can't blame them for doing it with a WWE Game as they series is mainly for the consoles like PS4 and Xbox One.","December 4, 2015","true","102.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have to recommend the game only because it will show 2K that there is a market for a WWE Game on the PC so if they end up putting WWE2K16 on PC it will be done better while the tactic is shady as all hell I can't blame them for doing it with a WWE Game as they series is mainly for the consoles like PS4 and Xbox One.","December 4, 2015","true","102.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

My Career is there, which is something I did not have on the xbox 360 version, but the advertised DLCs are not.\n\nOne of the first things I checked on was the difference between Create a Diva on this game and the 360 version, but I could not figure out how to create an actual diva. Haven't seen a single picture of a created diva for this game online either.\n\nSo, I went looking for anwers right away, but I found some forums that say Create a Diva has been deleted from the game. There are not enough divas in the game, and I made a few on the 360 version to fix this, but I can't seem to make one on the PC version.\n\nIf Create a Diva really is removed, I will sadly be playing the 360 version sooner than the Steam version. Now that I have GTA5, I doubt either version will be turned back on ever again. I should not have to choose between a version that has Create a Diva (instant winner), or a version that has My Career (why I bought it on PC). Another main reason I bought it on PC was to see improvements on created characters.\n\nMade an actual Show for just the divas on 360, and made 5 custom divas, along with the Female Hardcore Championship. Gone?\n\nUnless they add it back in, this is Not Recommended. Too big of a sacrifice from the 360 version. I know people will be all "It's wrestling! It's for men!", but let's not try to pretend we are going to ignore the divas, or that we don't to make one at some point.\n\n\nEdit: Okay, DLCs were added, but I still can't recommend it.

The game is poorly optimized which means that the gameplay suffers. When I reverse when prompting, most of the times it claims I did it too early. You also notice that it's poorly optimized when the framerate suffers when you're doing certain moves. From a smooth framerate, it gets slow and sometimes choppy. After the animation, it gets back to normal.\n\nThe rest of the game seems okay, though a lot of the options from the previous games have been stripped. Gone is the create-a-diva, gone is the create-an-arena (though I don't really miss that one), gone are most of the create-a-wrestler options. What you get is a bare-bone game. The MyCAREER has some interesting storylines, but most of the times you get Vicky saying "You can choose between these 2 matches". After 30 years (in-game), I finally got the WWE championship option while I won almost all of the matches. Even the ones against the shield, 2-on-one matches and other handicap matches. In those 30 years, I won the NXT championship and the Heavyweight Championship (after winning money in the bank).\n\nFor someone winning most of his matches, it didn't get recognized by the game, instead it choose to not give me options to go after championship matches (be it tag-team, intercontinental or the WWE championship). I'm going through a second run, I'm trying to be a face, but the game punishes me too hard for trying to win. When my manager interferes, I get heel points, when I use multiple finishers, I get heel points.

I dont know who wants to make a wrestler thats not based of anything but they must be a very boring bunch of people. Also i cant even make myself as theres no long hair, and clothing is very limited so you cant even make yourself.

You aren´t going to be able to create a demon or whatever you could in the previous games. Nor create an entrance video, nor a custom finnishing move. But the gameplay has improved alot. It gives you a more realistic gameplay with small changes that makes the game more real. Like the stamina bar for example.\nAfter you hit your big move on your opponent, if your stamina is low you will fall to your knees to take a breath.\nAnother change is that whenever you take a grapple move, the computer will read where you can do it without interfearence with ropes, etc. So your character automaticly drags the opponent to a place where the ropes doesn´t hit him.\nThe animations and graphics are also really good.\nAlso the career mode is interesting.

Without a doubt the worst ‘game’ (I will use this term loosely) I've ever played.\n\nLet’s start with the graphics. They're nice, run smoothly and are actually quite detailed. This is definitely the prettiest WWE game to date and I think the developers have done a wonderful job there. But what is the point of a game looking aesthetically pleasing if the mechanics are so rudimentary that they've somehow managed to script and add more taunting buttons than actual fighting/action buttons.\n\nI can only gather someone in the development team after intravenously absorbing multiple narcotics had wastefully decided to invest thousands of hours on the finite details of muscular definition and the high-definition photographic work of John Cena in the loading screens as opposed to focusing on the actual mechanically purpose and necessity of the game; which is to simulate being a wrestler immersed in the WWE universe. I technically can control a cactus’ growth more than I can control the fighting mechanics in this ‘game’. How ironic is it that WWE 2K15 has, to me, turned out to be just as fundamentally disappointing, timewasting and unentertaining as the real show that plagues FOX8 on a weekly basis.\nAbsolutely do not waste your money investing into this failed project which I hope with abundant optimism will fade into the trashy history of this century as nothing more than a redneck themed, trash sport who made a bratty, capitalist family rich enough to pile more food onto their silver spoons.\n\nIn summary, I'll rate this 'game' 0.5/10, with half a mark amounting to the detail of John Cena's skin in the loading screen.","December 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I found absolutely no redeeming qualities to this pile of garbage.\n\nThe new chain wrestling system is terrible.  When you start a chain-wrestling sequence, you basically play rock, paper, scissors to see who gets to do a move.

Without a doubt the worst ‘game’ (I will use this term loosely) I've ever played.\n\nLet’s start with the graphics. They're nice, run smoothly and are actually quite detailed. This is definitely the prettiest WWE game to date and I think the developers have done a wonderful job there. But what is the point of a game looking aesthetically pleasing if the mechanics are so rudimentary that they've somehow managed to script and add more taunting buttons than actual fighting/action buttons.\n\nI can only gather someone in the development team after intravenously absorbing multiple narcotics had wastefully decided to invest thousands of hours on the finite details of muscular definition and the high-definition photographic work of John Cena in the loading screens as opposed to focusing on the actual mechanically purpose and necessity of the game; which is to simulate being a wrestler immersed in the WWE universe. I technically can control a cactus’ growth more than I can control the fighting mechanics in this ‘game’. How ironic is it that WWE 2K15 has, to me, turned out to be just as fundamentally disappointing, timewasting and unentertaining as the real show that plagues FOX8 on a weekly basis.\nAbsolutely do not waste your money investing into this failed project which I hope with abundant optimism will fade into the trashy history of this century as nothing more than a redneck themed, trash sport who made a bratty, capitalist family rich enough to pile more food onto their silver spoons.\n\nIn summary, I'll rate this 'game' 0.5/10, with half a mark amounting to the detail of John Cena's skin in the loading screen.","December 2, 2015","false","1.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyrva/recommended/240460/","nyrva","Nyrva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nyrva/","49 products in account","First off - continuous rap/country music background! Annoying if you don't like rap or country. (I like classic rock and 80s metal thanks.)  Limited number of wrestlers, mostly of the new school. Outside of Ultimate Warrior, hardly any old favorite classic wreslters. Wrestler creation is extremely difficult. (Personal beef- Milwaukee, WI is not an optional home town for my own custom creations since that's my home town and the biggest city in Wisconsin- only Madison and Green Bay are offered for Wisconsin.)  Wrestler creation plain sucks overall since I don't see how I can get the models to take on the appearances of oldschool wrestlers I like. All sample designs are based on modern/current WWE lineup. GAMEPLAY is tough and hard to figure out controls. It seems you would need a college degree to figure out the correct way to work the buttons just to do simple punches, kicks, grabs, slams, etc. as opposed to older wrestling games. There are several locked wrestlers and options I will never be able to access simply because I can't figure out how to "wrestle" on this stupid thing. Overall- this game sucks. Unless you're a leet gamer who knows how this is supposed to work don't waste your money.","December 31, 2015","false","0.7"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

No action. You are pretty much playing minigames. The old style of arcade controls, where you feel real action and engagement is gone. You have to play these minigames for everything - you grab someone and wanna do a move on them, so you have to play the minigame.\n\nWhen opponents do moves on you, all you can do is get beat down until you reversal. At higher difficulty every move misses and all damage comes from reversals and occasional moves that were lucky to land. It becomes a reversalfest, and gets very old very quickly.\n\nThis does not engage or "feel like wrestling" it feels like waiting for the right moment to press the right button at the right time, like Guitar Hero or Guitaroo Man.  This is really just skaing on ice.\n\nNow, to rub salt in the eyes, you CANNOT change any  of this. Most game modes force you to use all default options, so you don't get to play how you want - you only play how you are told. Which means no blood, default difficulty, no making it harder (or easier).\n\nThere are also many pieces of missing content because this was ported from the PS4 version. The PS3 version of this game provides quite a few more match types and CAW options.\n\n\nWhen performing Submission moves, your stamina does not go down. It actually goes up!\nIn prior games, holding a submission made you lose Stamina.\n\nYour opponent does not have any reversal chance during a submission.\nIn prior games, submissions could be reversed mid-move.\n\nOpponent submissions zip to tapout really fast.\nNo matter how fast I press the button.\n\nSubmissions take you from no limb damage to orange immediately, with max sub defense.\nThis isn't much fun.\n\nRope Breaks force you to let go immediately.\nIn prior games, when Rope Break happens, you "can" hold up to 5 seconds before DQ.\n\nYou cannot make your Tag Team partner help you.\nIn prior games, you could call your opponent into the ring.\n\nThe handling is stiff, you cannot interrupt move sequences or graphics. This means for some moves, you have to wait 30 seconds of watching Dolph Ziggler drop 10 elbows, or being forced to watch R-Truth perform his entire dance routine. Every. Single. Move. With one chance to reversal before you have to watch another long graphic. When opponent rolls around selling a move, you have to wait for end before next move.\n\nRunning moves to downed opponents are wonky and stiff, usually just stomping.\n\nIn prior games, there was actual difficulty.\nThis game is just like skating on ice and doesn't feel like wrestling.\nThe controls are borky and all the minigames are a no-fun headache.\nThis does not make the game more challenging.\nThis is "fake difficulty" and makes the game less fun and engaging.","April 29, 2015","false","138.4"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

This is by far the worst game that WWE has come out with. There's no storyline like their used to be. The controls are difficult to even moderately grasp. The character selection is minimal. The lack of music on the game is disturbing, and the tracks chosen were a total joke. CAWs are terrible on this game as well. Then on top of the rest of it, this game is extremely buggy and the graphics just look bad to begin with. They literally made John Cena look like a caveman. I literally don't have a single positive thing to say about this game. Went out on a limb and bought this on a discount, and I'm still thoroughly disappointed. As someone who's been a diehard WWE fan my entire life, I seriously recommend that you NOT get this game.

Why not midnight? What's the difference?\n\nPrior to this game being released on PS4 and Xbox One 2K Sports was very tight lipped about details. On release it showed why...a small roster and piddling upgrades. So why do I bring this up?\n\nFrankly 2K games is starting to wear out my patience. The PC release of this game is unoptimized and slow. They also pulled a bit of a bait and switch by being very unclear about DLC being available to steam customers and not having Paige for not good reason.\n\nI have a GTX 970, an i7 4790K and 8 gigs of ram. this game is choppy and slow even with that kind of hardware. Apparently 2K Sports thinks everyone owns an IBM Sequoia because this is brutal.\n\nHalf the roster is locked and I can't be arsed to go through the game to unlock it. Some of you may be fine with jumping through unfun hoops to play the game...I am not.\n\nYou would think six months after release 2K would have this game polished with all content ready to go but obviously this was a rush job. The highlight reel is also screwed up and only shows part of the graphics and no movement.\n\nControls are also horrid, with the buttons you press only having the most casual relationship with what happens on screen.\n\nWait for a discount and a patch. Also do not support 2K Sports next year if they cannot treat their customers with some sort of respect.

The graphics, when jacked up all the way, look almost like you're watching wrestling on television. The controls are completely opposite from what I consider intuitive, but I'm slowly retraining myself from the N64 mechanics and it's going well thus far. The sound effects are great and there's LONG snappy wrestler intros for everyone.\n\nThat said, the game has a few areas that are kind of broken... the replay/highlight system is non-functional and the ropes don't even appear at all and there's no animation. During normal play, I got flashing disappearing ropes here and there.\n\nAnd, finally, the counter/reversal system is brutally unforgiving... Literally making a potentially epic gaming experience into a controller-throwing source of anger and frustration.\n\nI'm assuming they will patch these bugs in the coming weeks.\n\nEDIT: They have not modified the counter/reversal system and, of course, the game is still very much opposite of fun for casuals.

Like previous years versions, it has questionable hit detection, repeating canned commentary (though it has improved over the years), and sometimes sloppy mechanics. Even worse, it has stripped down the user creative tools to a mere handful of what it used to be.\n\nDespite all this, the re-branded SMACKDOWN game is as fast-paced and fun as it ever was. It has added a few gimmicks that freshen's up the gameplay, and this version is the closest to a wresting "simulator" the franchise has ever been. Combined with the new next-gen engine, the game looks better than it ever has.\n\nWhile this game wont attract non-fans of wrestling, it is definitely the game to own if you have, or ever had, a passing interest in the WWE.\n\n6/10 "Okay"","May 10, 2015","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes it has it's flaws but this is signs of good things from 2k as this was the first title handled by 2k entirely (2k14 they took over from THQ part way).\nThis is the base on which the next great generation of wrestling games will be built. Yes it's rough around the edges, but it still has all the charm of the WWE and enough customisation options to make any wrestler past or present. The DLC is all being provided free while it still costs a premium on consoles and it adds tons of extra stuff.\nThe price is a good deal for a "complete" version of the game and can be gotten cheaper on some websites already. Once this hits super sale prices it will be an easy choice for any wrestling fan.\nThe modding possibilities in due course will surely open up very easy ways to update and maintain the roster to match the current WWE.\nIf you don't own a console and have been dying for a wrestling game then this is it, enjoy it for what it is. If you own a console you may prefer to pick up 2k14 as the 30 years of wrestlemania mode is fantastic nostalgia. The Showcase mode in this works in a similar way but some of the choices of feuds for the DLC are questionable. One more match and Hall of Pain could easily have been substituted for such rivalries as The Rock vs Austin or McMahon vs Austin (either would have included some of the same bouts)","May 2, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With a fun mycareer mode and the ability to play old storylines it's refreshing and simple at times.  Other times it's so mind numbingly aggravating that you want to piledrive your tower just to never see the gaem again.  The AI seems to be randomly hard or easy, sometimes in between.  Most aggravating is the reversal system.  While it's much easier on PC then on console, it's still easy to miss a reversal by a fraction of a second, or for the computer to reverse everything from a lariat to the Pedigree, even though two seconds ago they were on the ground for a good 10-20 seconds.  Another complaint is the stamina.  It seems to drain ridiculously fast.  if I do a punch combo, I shouldn't run out of stamina, especially a minute or two into the match.  It's not realistic at all. Honestly, you're better off getting ahold of Smackdown Vs Raw for PS2.  I recommend 2010, back when story mode had a set, interesting and funny story.  Regardless of this, It's still fun, and worth a playthrough if you find it on sale.","November 22, 2015","true","28.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is it perfect? no, it is better than your only other option on PC "WWF RAW?" ... HELL YES!\n\nMods are making it AWESOME, buy it!\n\n- EDIT: I have to change my recommendation to a "No" for this game because when they released the update they put in some new reoptimization to appease the people who were trying to play it on a toaster and couldn't read the requirements of the game. In doing so they ♥♥♥♥ed up how the game runs and the higher powered systems now have to lower the quality to get it to run without lag.\n\nIn laymens terms: They made it run better on lower settings, but ♥♥♥♥ed up the higher settings. So it runs great, when it looks like ♥♥♥♥ and runs like ♥♥♥♥, when it looks great.

Its custimization feature is nothing compared to 2K14, it has 1 nice new feature, but that would basically be it. In 2K14 you have alot more custimizations available, more masks/clothing. You can edit the face more, more hair/facial hair.\n\nBut anyways thats not what the game is about, so I think this game is actually pretty good besides those exceptions, just one more feature which I think they shouldve added is the arena music effect they used in 2K14. It made you feel like you were there with all the echos, but yeah thats basically it, I would rate this 7 and a half outta 10.","May 2, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fluid gameplay. Get it if you’re a fan of WWE games. MODS.\n\nWhen I heard rumours about a PC release back when the game was initially first released for consoles I was very excited but did not hear anything for a long while and near enough gave up hope. Although it has been a long wait, WWE 2K15 is here!\n\nI have only played a couple hours of the game so far and I have been very impressed! Especially the graphics! The graphics are phenomenal compared to the past WWE games. The superstar models and the arenas are great! I would suggest getting the game for yourself and check it them out. What even impressed me more was the audience, you now have a range of audience model scattered around the arena, and I have yet to find similar looking models within a match. In the background during a match, you see pretty much a loop of an audience model walking down the stairs, walking in the background, as if they’ve been outside and they’re heading back into their seats. I thought that was a great addition, it is very life like and amusing to watch!\n\nThe first thing that I did when I got the game was play a one-on-one match. The main menu and modes are very easy to navigate, there’s more of a visual representation compared to the past WWE games. I played the first match and the gameplay was very fluid. Compared in the past, this game runs at a slower pace but it’s not bad as it creates a nice flow of the match. In addition to that, the stamina system they’ve implemented works really well, you can really tell by the end of the match how worn out your character is. The movements and execution of moves gets more slugging which adds a nice realistic effect. There are still minor glitches with the physics of the game but that’s to be expected!\n\nAfter a few matches, I then created my CAW. During this process I realised how limited the selection was, from hair to body art designs, etc. Although hopefully they’ll be some mods to provide more selection. I’m not entirely sure to why it was so limited, it might be because some are unlockable? I’m not sure but we’ll see. The create-an-entrance was also very limited compared to how it used to be but I still managed to create a decent looking entrance for my CAW.\nI then went on ahead and used my CAW on My Career which was interesting. It’s similar to how it works on NBA 2K15 or previous NBA series. Where you fight a match, earn VC and upgrade using your earned VC. But I have yet to explore different aspects of this game mode.\n\nLastly, I had a mess around on the 2K Showcase mode which I enjoyed very much even only having played 4 matches. You get the usual video promo of an event/rivalry to which then you play the matches and meet the objectives provided to which then leads in-game scene cuts. After completing a match and meeting the desired objectives, you then unlock Superstars, Arenas and furthermore.\n\nThis game is definitely worth getting if you’re a fan of WWE, Wrestling or previous WWE games. You will have to get used to the flow of the gameplay but it is a good wrestling game. Although this game might be limited for now, there will soon be mods (hopefully) to expand the game. This is also 2K’s first Next-Gen WWE game therefore we can’t expect the game to be complete. We will have to wait and see with what they do to WWE 2K16.","April 28, 2015","true","85.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only "My Carreer", some mode for your own superstar. Makes sense. Take away all the possibilities for creating an unique custom superstar - add only gamemode for custom superstar.\n\nOnly thing the game got is great graphics.

There's a decent selection of gameplay types and the 2k showcase is a fun diversion if you're sort of a mark like me.  Like many have said this game is a port of the PS4 and Xbone version of the game which sacrifices some bells and whistles of the last gen version for prettier graphics.  As it is a console port, a controller is a must being as the default keyboard configuration isn't really all that smooth for things like chain grapples.  The game runs fine for me with the exception of weird graphical artifacts and broken replays (although the replays seem to be fixed, for me at least.), I'd make sure your rig matches at least the recommended system specs if you want to take a chance and pick this up, being as there are many people having issues with this game.  All in all, as really the only polished, somewhat current wrestling game available on PC- I'd recommend this, however if you already have this on console- there's nothing new to see here.","April 29, 2015","true","36.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was grossly mistaken. Having spent almost $70 for the deluxe edition on the console only to find out there wasnt any career mode except for Xbox one, ps4 and PC, I would have toi say I was almost willing to chuck my dualshock at the tv screen after an overnight download of the PS3 version. I went to Best Buy the next day and bought a Xbox one controller and sucked it up and paid for a copy of the game on PC.\n\nWhat a world of difference! Highly reccomended! The controller makes the gameplay so much more enjoyable! Granted im a little ticked that Geforce experience doesnt pick up on the graphics settings Im stil very surprised that my 2gb 770 can handle it.\n\nAnd if your not down with that I got two words for ya.","May 17, 2015","true","23.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes it has it's flaws but this is signs of good things from 2k as this was the first title handled by 2k entirely (2k14 they took over from THQ part way).\nThis is the base on which the next great generation of wrestling games will be built. Yes it's rough around the edges, but it still has all the charm of the WWE and enough customisation options to make any wrestler past or present. The DLC is all being provided free while it still costs a premium on consoles and it adds tons of extra stuff.\nThe price is a good deal for a "complete" version of the game and can be gotten cheaper on some websites already. Once this hits super sale prices it will be an easy choice for any wrestling fan.\nThe modding possibilities in due course will surely open up very easy ways to update and maintain the roster to match the current WWE.\nIf you don't own a console and have been dying for a wrestling game then this is it, enjoy it for what it is. If you own a console you may prefer to pick up 2k14 as the 30 years of wrestlemania mode is fantastic nostalgia. The Showcase mode in this works in a similar way but some of the choices of feuds for the DLC are questionable. One more match and Hall of Pain could easily have been substituted for such rivalries as The Rock vs Austin or McMahon vs Austin (either would have included some of the same bouts)","May 2, 2015","true","26.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To me, the glitches are half the game. They're ♥♥♥♥ing halarious. For instence, in Nerd³'s video, he was playing a six-man ladder match. Dolph Zigler and Triple H were on the ladder. Nerd³ -playing as Dean Ambrose - pushed over the ladder. Suddenly, for absolutely no reason what so ever, Triple H started orbiting the ring at 17 million mph, causing the camera to vibrate and making the video vertually impossible to watch until it stopped. How could you say that that is bad? (unless you threw up or something)\n\nNow let's talk about the second half - the gameplay. Whilst a lot of the community - including me - miss the arcade-like style from the older games, I do really like the realistic gameplay that 2K introduced into this game. Nothing is more satasfying than Lionsault-ing somebody in 2K15. You really didn't get that in the older games. Even the running finishers feel very nice. The Brouge Kick has never felt so good to do when you just run at somebody and destroy their face with your Irish boot.\n\nUnfortunately, there are downsides - a lot of them. A lot of game modes are missing like backstage fights, handicap matches, 1v1 ladder matches and so on. They added a load of pointless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like the King Of The Ring tounaments, which are very novel and useless. They have No Holds Bared and Extreme Rules which have no differences at all. A lot of of creation options are missing. Hairs are very dissapointing. (I don't know how many times I have seen CAWs with the same longish hair with the streak in it) Clothing is meh. Tattoos and such are dissapointing. Create a finisher is missing, along with create an arena, create a title/ championship and many more. As far as I can tell, there are no custom storylines, either.\n\nBut with all that said, it's not a bad game. There are a lot of characters and MyCareer is something to do for a bit. In what other game could you make a silly Italian man with a sock puppet fight an Iraqi General. (no, I'm not ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you. You can do that)","October 18, 2015","true","91.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics and animation are great but it is way too hard to control! The game seems based off reversals which are very hard to pull off. You will either hit the button too soon or too late and want to throw the controller across the room. Even kicking out of a pin is way too difficult!","October 18, 2015","false","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But again suffers from the same fate as other games when it comes to A.I. , balance and gameplay. The game reverses whatever it wants and if you turn reversals down to get a better gaming experience. Then the game will ignore your button presses when it wants the computer to win.  So instead of the challenge being a computer opponent that wrestlers better, its just a game that doesnt allow you to do your moves, while giving the computer all the opportunity to do thiers, so you lose based on the computers desires instead of your effort or ability. This makes the game and gameplay cheap and frustrating instead of being a challenge or fun. Concept of gameplay and how that is handled needs to be reviewed.","October 24, 2015","false","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
