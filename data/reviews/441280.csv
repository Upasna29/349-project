It's not enough for me to say that this is a really good game, and that it's a hidden gem well-deserving of your time. I have to write something that goes above and beyond, so that you come away thinking "Wow! This is serious! I must play this game immediately!" This is the difficulty I've run into when writing about games that are really impressive. Aside from having a mediocre vocabulary, I'm too used to discussing what's wrong with games, to really explain what's right with them.\n\nFor example, let's start with the controls. When the controls are thoroughly solid, then there's actually nothing to discuss. In this game, moving the anthropomorphic rabbit around is as natural and easy as turning one's palm. The controls are so good, that you won't notice them. They're like an extension of yourself. As the game progresses, Jonathan (the rabbit) acquires new moves and abilities, and the experience continues to be perfectly seamless. Another aspect that goes un-noticed when it's handled properly is the mechanics. The hit-boxes are great, the game doesn't try your patience with cheap hits, and nothing stands out... poorly.\n\nOft-times with Metroidvanias, there's only so much of an incentive to explore. Pharaoh Rebirth+ strikes a good middle-ground with its plethora of collectible treasures. What makes exploration interesting is that not all of the items are helpful. Some exist solely to fill slots in your collection screen, while others can boost stats or award hidden skills. This adds another layer of mystery to the adventure. Every time you discover a hidden artifact, you gain a sense of anticipation. Whereas in most other similarly-designed games, all you have to look forward to is another heart container, or a slightly larger box to hold more daffodils. When you fight enemies in that other game, are you even using the daffodils? It's a completely meaningless collectible.\n\nThe sub-weapons in this game are not only fun to use, but they're also very helpful. While Jonathan's ears are just as deadly as any whip, the sub-weapons allow you to approach situations and bosses in different ways. Some of them can have other uses as well. There's a certain point very late in the game where you're faced with a spike pit. Over this pit is a floor, but most of the sections are false, and you'll fall to your death if you attempt to cross. The first weapon you obtain is a machine-gun... that fires tennis balls. As they bounce across the ground, they'll helpfully point out which sections of the floor are false, so you can safely pass. It reminds me of Megaman 2.\n\nThese days, it seems like every indie title references classic games from the distant past. Thankfully, Pharaoh Rebirth+ sets itself apart by implementing its references in a clever manner. As far as I can tell, the least subtle reference is one of the characters having the name Belmondo. Just from playing through the game, the Konami influences are pretty clear, but you're not going to get hit over the head with them. It also helps that the character-designs are charming and have their own unique look. The soundtrack is thoroughly fantastic as well.\n\nFor the most part, the level-design is superb. Since every stage is self-contained, there isn't a need to make sure that each location connects to the others. The stages are well-designed, so that the first play-through is sufficiently enthralling. Also, you're welcome to repeat stages to find all of the hidden treasures. In many cases this is required, since the double-jump isn't available until towards the end. When repeating a previously-cleared stage, the pacing is speedy, and you can even take advantage of a few shortcuts.\n\nBut you're probably wondering what I meant when I wrote "For the most part". Well, this game has a vehicle-section. In stage 4, you have to drive a jeep. Actually, you don't drive it so much as time jumps to avoid plummeting to your death. To start things off with a positive I can say this much: It could've been a lot worse. There are visual and audio warnings when a jump is coming, and there are four checkpoints, which is pretty generous for a section that should take less than four minutes.\n\nStill, "driving the jeep" in Pharaoh Rebirth+ is a textbook example of everything that's wrong with vehicle-sections. Several years ago, I actually wrote an opinion-piece on the subject. Looking back at it now, "driving the jeep" covers all of the bases. I played through this game on the normal level of difficulty, and I died more times on the jeep than anywhere else in the game. A sizable number of these deaths can also be attributed to the annoyingly-placed treasures throughout the stage. Also, If I want to 100% complete the game and get all of the achievements, I have to perfect my driving skills. To that I say: No thanks. All that said, the vehicle-section in this game isn't terrible, and it probably won't grind everything to a screeching halt, but I would have gladly traded this section away for a fully-featured stage.\n\nThe only other complaint I have is that you can only have one save-game at a time. I suppose this could be worked around by moving the old save-file to a different folder. I'll have to give it a shot sometime, because I'm really curious about the hard difficulty-setting.\n\nAside from an unfortunate vehicle-section, Pharaoh Rebirth+ is a superb game. It's a reminder that yes, even today there are great 16-bit/32-bit inspired action-platformers getting released. It's a shame I couldn't come up with anything significant to say though. What can I say? Even when I recognize quality, it's tough to put together the words that do it justice.\n\nDisclaimer: For the purpose of this review, a key was provided by the publisher.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","March 30","true","6.3"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","12"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/recommended/441280/","aldershot","[F!] Aldershot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aldershot/","2454 products in account","Pharaoh Rebirth takes the idea of metroidvania style of maps and item acquisition and mashes it up with more high action platformers such as Dust, or Cave Story.\n\nTo break the game down simply, you go from stage to stage, searching through the map for new items and skills in order to advance through, until you reach the end boss. Along your journey you have a variety of ways to defend yourself against the game's varied amount of enemies and traps. You have a basic forward attack, an upward swing, and the ever useful, aerial somersault. Each attack will have it's own advantages and disadvantages, for example, the normal attack does a ton of damage but have limited reach and utility. While the aerial somersault is incredibly useful for comboing, protecting yourself from oncoming projectiles, and for control of a given combat scenario, however, it's weaker than your basic attack. You also have a quick dodge / dash that you can use for both maneuverability, as well as bypassing incoming projectiles. Along your travels you'll also come across items of varying degree. Some items will give you passive buffs, while others are active, and can be used to heal, buff, and some are even usable weapons. As you continue through the game you'll find many more skills, items, and weapons. This is essentially the core of what makes up Pharaoh Rebirth.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40NrVqes0s8\nPharaoh Rebirth's visuals are well illustrated and animated. The frames are smooth, and the pixel art professional looking. The overall design is rather cutesy, but not so overbearingly so, that you'll be ashamed to play it in public. It's overall aesthetic quality is great, but it is mired by technical limitations. There is no native resolution, no 1080p, or even simply a wide screen mode. If you set the game to "full screen" on the pre-launch menu, you'll be greeted with stretched pixels, and distorted images. Even when set to Windowed mode, the game will launch as a tiny 640 X 640 square, where you'll have to manually stretch the game, doing your best not to stretch the pixels out side of it's originally designed resolution. To say the least, this is not optimal.\n\nThe game itself is a very enjoyable romp, that offers a fair challenge to the player, while maintaining a very accessible set of mechanics that most could quickly understand within just a few minutes of play. Though it's simple at first, you'll find yourself dying more than once as you progress. Enemies take off large chunks of life, and there is no health regen except very specifically located check points. Trial and error will be your best teacher. As you would expect from a metroidvania style of game you'll be fighting bad guys, and exploring the map which seems like a fine endeavor, however, there doesn't seem to be any real map makers, compass, minimap, or even... a map at all. The player will be forced to rely on memory, or in my case, pure attrition to make it out of any given stage.\n\nOverall Pharaoh Rebirth is a satisfying, and enjoyable action platformer with some metroidvania style mechanics for good measure. The combat and map design are enjoyable, creative, and just deep enough to keep players entertained, however, what is an otherwise very enjoyable game is mired by technical limitations with it's resolution, and player conveniences such as a map.\n\nPros:\n- Enjoyable combat and boss fights\n- Just deep and challenging enough to satisfy\n- Simple enough for casual play\n- Excellent animation and pixel art\n\nCons:\n- No map (That I could find)\n- Terrible resolution options\n\n► Pharaoh Rebirth hours played: 3.5\n► Completion Status on Pharaoh Rebirth: Incomplete\n► This copy of Pharaoh Rebirth was provided by the developer / publisher","March 18","true","5.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

It's really a shame because there's so much care put into this work that might get overshadowed by tons of pointless "retro" platformers which come out every day.\n\nGameplay\nMechanics-wise, the game is pretty solid. There are various moves that can be executed from the start and others to be unlocked. Overall, combat works as intended and every enemy or boss has a dinstinct pattern that often intersects nicely with the level layouts.\n\nPlayer progression is not based on elements borrowed from RPG's like experience points or equipment, but instead rewards exploring and collecting the different, unique treasures scattered through the ruins and temples of Egypt.\n\nInstead of presenting itself with one, massive area that blocks your progress whenever you don't possess the right ability to get through, the game has a standard, stage-based structure. This helps in limiting both the backtracking factor and the typical "fake sense of freedom" of the genre.\n\nI found the level design to be quite clever, as it encourages exploration by showing the player unaccessible routes right from the start, but never requires to backtrack to a previous stage to get to the next. This means freedom of choosing  to get on with the story OR to go back and replay a chapter to get all the extra stuff which could come in handy, without being forced to revisit some old areas to get a mandatory powerup.\n\nThe classic stage-based structure also makes it easier to carry out more action-oriented set pieces, like a helicopter pursuit or a mine car ride.\n\nArt Direction\nTechnically speaking, Pharaoh Rebirth+ looks and sounds great. The high-res (640x480) nicely crafted and animated pixel art is matched by an upbeat, memorable soundrack which features an obvious Egyptian vibe. However, digitally painted character portraits that show up during radio chatter fall a bit short, as they look detached from the overall style and don't really match its quality.\n\nI recommend playing the game using its original 4:3 ratio, as stretching 2D art is a crime, especially when it's done so well.\n\nTechnical Issues\nAs of today, screen resolution selection and VSync have been fixed, so I don't have anything else to report at this time.\n\nSo, should I play it?\nYES, you should. If you love action platformers, the metroidvania genre or just appreciate tightly designed games.","March 20","true","19.8"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

And yes, bad opening joke for this review. But Pharaoh Rebirth+ is a solid but not spectular game in the metroidvania genre, specifically harking back to the days of the NES with it's specific yet purposeful enemy placement and level designs. There's a good mixture of combat, platforming, and exploration with not too much backtracking, and a good set of systems that complement each other overall. Good variations of level backgrounds, good change of pace gameplay, there's a lot of good, not great here.  There's a bunch of fun to be had here, I just wish that the game was better implemented, with the 360 controller not working for me at all, and resolutions options that aren't really up to par with modern day systems (and not even any options for the full screen entirely. There are also some inconsistencies in the design, as some of the levels have areas that you're just on the cusp on making the jump, only to realize that you just don't have the ability to actually make it. It's no where near a big problem, but it's more of an annoyance that keeps on showing up over and over again, getting a tiny bit more annoying each time. But regardless, it's a good game that's appropriate for it's price point, and is worth your time if you like the genre.\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nNostalgia takes hold with classic Castlevania (NES) gameplay. Rushing through areas will get your ♥♥♥ kick, as enemy placement and damage is purposeful and has a certain rhythm to it.\nControls work well in giving the preciseness you need to snipe enemies with your whip-ears while not being too loose for the platforming.\nGood difficulty ramp as the game isn't brutal, but again, punishes impatience and expects precision. Some good difficult platforming portions that require skill and challenge.\nGreat visual designs complemented with great animation quality. Watching Jonathan eat food in particular was always fun.\nSecondary weapons provide specific purposes and are very useful when busted out in that right situation. Not over powered, but good complements to the whip.\nGreat Level Design and enemy placement as a whole. Developers understood their game and it's engine's strengths rather well.\nNegatives:\n720p resolution in windowed mode, and not even a resolution option for full screen mode.\nRecording wise, was a nightmare. FRAPS gave performance issues, OBS was like “Nope”, and shadowplay while working, recorded at 640x480.\nMissing basic options expected on a PC port, such as music/sound sliders (just one slider for audio in a pre-launcher)\nSome enemies blend too much in the background, not giving enough of a clue of where they are on screen in order to deal with them.\nSome parts have trial and error learning mechanics that don't do a very good job of teaching the player that they can't do the specific event right now.","March 17","true","4.9"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","15","23","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/headcrabrape/recommended/441280/","headcrabrape","Diebuster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/headcrabrape/","77 products in account","Edit: http://steamcommunity.com/app/441280/discussions/0/36854258586204257 I have encountered an as of now rare glitch that effectively froze my save file for good. I still stand by everything I said in my review about the game itself, but this REALLY needs to be fixed. I recommend backing up your saves in case something bad happens (especially do this at the start of the Cairo level), nonetheless, a; big problem to take note of. I suspect it happens specifically for that specific boss because it's not a battle that you can spawn out later; it may also happen to other non-"Guardian" bosses that don't re-spawn. So just to be safe, occasionally back-up your saves and/or try to beat bosses instantly once you come across them. I'm conflicted because this is a fantastic game everyone should experience but something really awkward happened while I was playing it. Just... keep your save file safe, and if something similar DOES happen to you too please report it ASAP.\n\n===Original unedited review===\n\nKrobon, a depressingly little-known Japanese indie developer, along with composer Pepo and illustrator Doromizu, made one of the finest indie games I've ever played: treasure-hunting, exploratory platform game with the showmanship and over-the-top, inventive craziness of the best arcade games. Before I continue praising this game though, I'll have to make a little side-note: those expecting the interconnected worlds of traditional "Metroidvanias" might be disappointed: this game features a more streamlined, stage-based layout. Don't mistake "streamlining" for "hand-holding", though; all the hidden passages and invisible walls are for you to discover; the enemies and platforming for you to defeat, as they can and will kill you if you're not paying attention or using your skills effectively (on that note I recommend playing on Hard mode for the best experience). Krobon offers us some absolutely out-there scenarios presented in a suitably exaggerated way, including (I'll try to make this as non-spoilerish as possible by not giving away the context, though feel free to skip the paragraph if you're bothered by even the most minor of spoilers) **********dodging lasers from outer-space while using a Jojo's Bizarre Adventure-like Stand to beat up crazed Egyptian hotel employees. And you can also get drunk off your ♥♥♥ while doing so.***********. Yes, that is a thing that happens.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much as good as this type of game gets; the controls are spotless, the difficulty curve is near-perfect (maybe the first Guardian boss is a LITTLE too hard given what came before, but that's a massive nitpick), the levels are well-designed and nicely varied... and perhaps best of all, the game doesn't let you ruin its challenge by allowing you to mindlessly grind. The ONLY way to build your stats in this game is by exploring the levels and finding hidden items, which is perfect for the tone of the game. The unlocking of skills and thus areas that were inaccessible in the past is gradual, yet just fast enough to make you feel like you're constantly making progress and getting stronger as you go along on your epic adventure. To avoid any hassle, though, I recommend screencapping the mini-map whenever you uncover a dead end that requires a later skill; or, if you're THAT type of player, drawing your own map using pencil and paper. Some might take issue with the car-driving stage and the somewhat trial-and-error way of collecting all the treasure by making blind jumps. Another minor gripe is the lack of a fast-travel system, which I personally would have liked; but, much like this game's other flaws, it is just that: a minor gripe that shouldn't keep you from playing this game (after all, the stage-based setup is kind of like a fast travel system of its own and the levels become easier to navigate as you unlock more skills). Another such minor gripe includes the lack of specific sliders for music and sound; there's just a simple sound volume slider and that's it.\n\nNarratively, Rebirth does a great job for what it is; the dialogue never felt like it was wasting my time, and if YOU feel like it's wasting yours, you can always skip pretty much every cutscene, even if you haven't gone through it before. I don't recommend it, though; the presentation as a whole actually makes you feel like you're really an archeologist, exploring every nook and cranny of a strange yet often surprisingly serious cartoon world. In fact, the juxtaposition of comedic shenanigans with dramatic moments and even little nuggets of brief yet oddly-fitting sociopolitical commentary make the writing a huge treat, somewhat comparable to an Osamu Tezuka story. The translators also did a great job at making the dialogue have a natural flow to it, which is great because the character interaction is charming and often genuinely funny. The Egyptian atmosphere is nicely complemented by Pepo's tunes, which succeed at giving the game a dynamic action-adventure feeling.\n\nGraphically, Pharaoh Rebirth would have been impressive even if it came from a team of hard-working sprite artists. However, if Krobon's own Twitter account is any indication, he's responsible for absolutely every bit of pixel art and animation in the game, with Doromizu only having the job of drawing the non-pixelated character art and portraits. As someone who's obsessively into animation, this is particularly impressive to me because this is one of *THOSE* 2D sprite-based games; the kind that, instead of simply doing its job to serve the gameplay, genuinely takes into account the principles of animation to make controlling your character and fighting enemies feel particularly lively. It's not quite on the level of games like Metal Slug 3 or Super Tempo in terms of feeling like you're playing a wonderfully made cartoon (the use of color could use some work, for example), but it's still pretty up there and Krobon is a very high-level sprite artist. The animation and believable physics (shooting tennis balls underwater makes them float to the top!) makes navigating the levels and fighting enemies feel fluid and fun.\n\nThe fact that this game has been out for so long while not being covered at all by the gaming press shows just how little hard work and clever, well-executed ideas matter in the anglosphere's indie gaming scene. Along with Krobon's inability to make connections with indie-clique darlings and journos comes the dreary number of only TWO Metacritic reviews of this game. This unfairness is why I only now decided to point out that there is a shareware, untranslated version of the game out there. Beyond the English script, it lacks the extra stage of the Steam version along with the difficulty settings (and likely other stuff; I only played a tiny bit of the shareware version), but I chose to buy this primarily to support an extremely talented underdog developer who put loads of love, care and effort into creating a charming little adventure that should not be forgotten.\n\nAlso, a little hint: there's an item you can ONLY get from right after the first boss battle by doing a specific thing over and over again. Otherwise, say goodbye to 100% completion.\n\n===Edit upon completion===\n\nIf you spend a lot of time exploring, you might end up too powerful and the end bosses will be too easy. In order to avoid this, I recommend completing the game and THEN going out of your way to treasure-hunt.","April 14","true","46.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The lead character has great animation, can attack in multiple directions, and moves pretty fast. I found the amount of chatting between the characters was a bit much for me, but I did appreciate how distinct each character felt in the end. I'm not sure a game like this needs lots of banter but it made me laugh a few times and can be skipped if you don't want to bother.\nWhen I call Pharaoh Rebirth+ a "Castlevania-lite" I mean it's more like Order of Ecclesia than Symphony of the Night. The game occurs over a series of stages rather than one large level. You can replay stages as much as you like, re-fight bosses if you choose, and once you find an item it's yours forever. A lot of collectibles don't do much though, and many stages have dead-end hallways that make exploration less fun than it should be. There's also a "driving" stage which is basically a minecart level and a complete waste of time.\nHowever, the lead character is charming and fun to control. The boss battles are exciting. The story never pays off in interesting ways, but the characters have more personality than they normally do in games like this. Pharaoh Rebirth+ is worth playing, though I can't say I enjoyed it enough to bother replaying it to find every collectible.","May 5","true","6.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The story follows Jonathan, a cursed explorer, as he tries to find the 7 holy grails and remove his curse. The writing is actually quite funny and smacks of earlier Metal Gear Solid games' style of humor. Mechanically, the action is quite good. There are dodge mechanics and a veritable arsenal of abilities and sub-weapons to help you customize the action to your style of play. Past levels will reward you for revisiting them with new abilities, subweapons, and stat upgrades.\n\nIf you like Metroidvanias with a more action-y style, then check out this game.

Gets quite difficult in some segments, but rarely unfairly so.

Now the game looks great and I've changed my review to a recommend.\n\n\nThis game seems very well-made and fun so far. I would love to be able to recommend it to people. Unfortunately, there are two things that are currently preventing me from doing that.\n\n1) There is only one resolution option: 640*480. That's it. Not really sure what that's about. They should have given us two or three different options at the very least. One seems pretty ridiculous. Especially one that small.\n\n2) There is no apparent way to enable v-sync. The resolution problem I could actually live with. No v-sync? That's a deal-breaker. All that horrible screen tearing makes this lovingly-crafted, beautiful game look nothing short of atrocious.\n\nI'm hoping the developer can resolve these issues with a future update. Just like the screen is when I try to play this game, I myself am torn. I want to recommend it. But until they give us v-sync (and maybe some other resolution options), I just can't.","March 20","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pharaoh Rebirth has some fantastic spritework, great animations, and some great and catchy music.  I was actually quite surprised by the fun selection of subweapons in the game too, they're pretty diverse and aren't really like your standard Castlevania subweapons. The developers of this game very clearly liked Order of Ecclesia as you can see some clear callbacks and inspiration, for example instead of being a standard Metroidvania that takes place in one huge map the game actually has seperate levels to choose from that each has their own map.\n\nHell I'm surprised a game this good is priced at $10, I'd gladly shell out $20 or more for games of this quality.\n\nThe only real downside I'd say about this game is that personally towards the last half of the game the bosses take a dip in difficulty, especially if you were exploring properly and find a number of attack/defense boosting relics.","April 1","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The screenshots and trailer didn't do much for me, but the gifs on the developer's Twitter page (https://twitter.com/krobon) got me interested. The 'behind the scenes' of the game looked so cool! So, based on the quality of those gifs, I bought the game...and I'm SO glad I did. 'Pharaoh Rebirth +' is an exceptionally well made game with a lot of heart. It's also SUPER fun to play. :)\n\nPROS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Likable and well-written characters. I was surprised how much I cared for the characters in this game. Everyone is just so likable and fleshed out. VERY cute and funny dialogue throughout.\n- Excellent gameplay. The game runs at a smooth 60 FPS and feels very responsive. LOTS of polish in gameplay overall. Very well done.\n- Fun abilities. This is a big one. This is a video game that is not afraid to have fun being a video game. (Following is a minor spoiler) One of the abilities allows you to change your ears into a paper airplane to glide across wide gaps. That right there should tell you everything you need to know. It's silly, it's funny, it's unconventional and it was ALWAYS very fun to play. :)\n- There's a metroidvania element, with abilities allowing you to access areas you couldn't previously. However, it has a level-based structure, instead of one big map. This is actually really cool, since it allowed you to just go back to the level where you remember an element was and explore more in that area.\n- GREAT music. It's so good. The soundtrack is on my computer right now. LOVE the music SO MUCH!!\n- When it was over, I got kinda bummed out since I wanted more to play. That (to me) is always a sign of a great game. I've put 12 hours into the game, beaten it - and still go back quite often to play levels. It's just FUN to play.\n- LOTS of abilities and collectibles. If you like to play with new, interesting abilities and find cool collectibles, you'll love this game. ^_^\n\nCONS\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n- There are a couple times where the main gameplay is not platforming. Like, they'll have mini-games, puzzles, driving sections and things like that. While I understand that those sections were there to provide variety, they were also my least liked sections of this game. This game EXCELS in platforming, so I just wanted to spend more time doing that. It didn't feel good to get stuck on a section that gameplay-wise didn't have anything to do with the rest of the game. Thankfully, these moments were brief. Just thought I'd mention them here.\n- I hear that this game launched kinda rough in regards to vsync support and things like that. I think the devs have pretty much fixed all those issues. Again, just mentioning it.\n- The analog controls didn't seem to work 100% of the time for me. The devs patched in a deadzone option, but even with it at the max setting, my character still drifts to the left sometimes. Thus, I ended up playing it with the D-Pad (as opposed to the left analog stick) on a wired Xbox 360 controller. That solved the problem.\n\nOVERALL\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n'Pharaoh Rebirth +' is a fantastic game with a lot of heart. Though there were initially a few technical hangups, the fun of the game overcame those shortcomings and I had a BLAST with this game. SO much fun. Very much looking forward to what the devs work on next! :)\n\nP.S. If you want to see another game that the devs have worked on, you can check out 'Action Mogura'. It's available for free online! :) A bit of warning, though: It's only in Japanese and MUCH more difficult than 'Pharaoh Rebirth +'. I beat it in a few days, though - so it's quite playable. Just letting you know. ^_^\n\nFINAL SCORE\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n9 out of 10","May 24","true","14.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Stages are stand alone stages you can revisit at any time once you complete them. A fun game either way and a bit challenging on Hard for boss fights until you get some super powered items way later or respond incredibly well (or eat all your carrots).\n\nExploration and finding items among backtracking after you find abilities to find more items is really prevalent in this title. A plus or minus for fans of those.\n\nI only found a few of the lines to be funny from all its quirky dialogue. Some of the music was pretty great, too.\n\nThe driving stage is still kind of a pain, though. For the rest, they seem fun enough. More of a pain for achievements. It's easier by difficulty, though.\n\nAs an ending note, leave at least one of all your food items if you want the collector achievement or you can play through it all again..","May 3","true","41.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
