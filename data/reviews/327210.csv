It is the same kind of light repetitive difficult fun as Super Meat Boy, for example. But it does allow you to save your progress and give you infinite lives, which I really like. The story is simple, with nice characters, and the art (especially the planets and game menus!) and soundtrack are pretty awesome.\nThe direction controls are a little strange, particularly moving from a planet to another, because of the difference in their gravities. It takes a few tries to get used to them, but you eventually do. Also, I've been told the developers are working on an update to improve this. (I haven't tried using a controller, so I can't really say anything about controller support, which the other reviewer had problems with.)\nIf you're a fan of games like Super Meat Boy, you really should check this out.","October 9, 2014","true","1.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

I must admit I've expected mediocre game but this is actually a positive surprise for the price! Whole crazy hiphop/funky/arty style of visuals and sound just perfectly fits within the gameplay.\n\nImportant thing to say about Cheesecake Cool Conrad, besides characters being cool, is the difficulty. This game definitely isn't for impatient people. You aren't limited by any timers to beat the level, you just have to be patient to jump through the planets in right moments to find all ice cream crystals (and marry the princess in the end).\n\nPros:- Great platformer gameplay. Gravity might feel weird (at the price of more arcade platforming) but the gameplay overall is really enjoyable.\n- Unique visuals and sounds. There's many crazy ideas used in the game, you can make your impression from screenshots at least.\n- Hip hop and funky soundtrack. I'm not listening to those music genres but it perfectly fits into the game. This connection feels even better there than in Sideway New York, which was completely styled into graffiti and hiphop style.\n- Levels aren't completely linear. There are levels which feels more like mazes with planets and you'll have to find the right way.\n- Full gamepad support. My Xbox 360 gamepad worked immediately without any requirements to config the game.\n- Low price.\n- Local co-op for up to 4 players.\n\nCons:- Requires being patient. So if rage and impatience are your traits, you should rather not buy this game.\n- No achievements.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","January 6","true","1.2"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","1"

T\nhe whole thing is pleasantly straightforward.\n\nGET THE CRISTALS.\nGET THE CAKES.\nREACH THE EXIT.\nDO NOT DIE.\n\nAs you progress, these basic objectives become actually very challenging. Sometimes you need quick reflexes to dodge obstacles. Sometimes you need to make a very precise sequece of jumps. Sometimes you need to really use your brain to find your way through.\nThe game makes a good job at mixing things up. Dull moments are a bit rare, tough sometimes, when you die, the moving planets might take a while to reset, and that waiting is a bit annoying, but certainly nothing gamebreaking or that migth spoil the experience.\n\nAnother highlight that deserves a big note are the graphic and sound designs.\nThe gaphics are neat, fun and clear, with interesting characters and funny enemies, things change a lot from a world to another, so its hard to get tired of the colorful and unique art style.\nThe music is fun too, it's a cool jazz improvisation that goes very well with the funny graphic design and the simple yet charming animations.\n\nOverall, it makes for a pretty neat experience.\nCertainly worth a look.","October 14, 2014","true","0.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Based on fun characters, a simple plot and a reasonable amount of challenge, it'll make you spend considerable hours on it.\nWith great gravity mechanics, at some points it'll demand some good reflexes and skill to walk through all the 56 levels (8 worlds - 7 levels per world).\nAnd...oooh...how i wish that some other companies would invest on the soundtrack like this one did: the mix of modern jazz fits perfectly with the lightness of the gameplay. Worth the acquisition.","October 14, 2014","true","0.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

I surely got confused by the controls at first, but it only made me play more to work myself out of the levels and also after a few levels you get used to it. There are some really though levels, so it's a really nice game if you're looking for a challenge. And as they say: Don't worry if you die a lot, 'cause you will xD. There are some minor bugs in some levels and something that didn't allowed me to go to the 8th world yet, even after completion of the levels before it, so I'm hoping for an update to drop by anytime soon.","December 10, 2014","true","14.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quinble/recommended/327210/","Quinble","Quinble","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Quinble/","57 products in account","Extremely addicting game and fairly challenging too. I found myself obsessing over completing the levels, once you get two crystals in there is basically no going back because you don't want to quit mid level and have to do the whole thing over again. Some levels are much, much harder than others and the difficulty definitely goes up with each new world. I definitely utilized a lot of the save points, and liked that there were infinite deaths. On one hand, it is nice to not have to reset the level after a certain amount of deaths, on the other when you get over x20 deaths it really starts to hurt your self esteem lol.\n\nNot very many bugs, however on levels where there were a lot of enemies shooting things I experienced quite a bit of loading lag that made the already difficult challenges even MORE challenging. Also, at 6-2 I had a problem where I had to keep resetting the level to complete it because after a certain amount of jumps the fish planets wouldn't reappear if I died trying to get a crystal. I don't know if that was intentional to add to the difficulty, but I didn't see it utilized in subsequent levels so I Assume that it was a bug.\n\nOverall, great game, pretty smooth gameplay, appropriately challenging, addicting, and fantastic music.","January 20, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's vertical.\nLevels one and two are easyish, no real tutorial. But then level 3, it goes from 2 bad guys to about 6, about 4 new concepts to adapt to.\nAnd yeah, Xbox controller support... it works... but it's very difficult to adapt to as you push left to run one way and suddenly it switches direction!\n\nBut overall, I cannot wait to torture myself with this game more, it's awesome, challenging, could do with some fixes and balancing but it's just so cute!\n\nIt's at least worth a go!","April 5, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each one is a fun option. It can be a little tricky at first when you aren't used to the controls, so I recommend using a controler but it can still be played without one. The animation is bright and colorful and you are able to remain at your most recent save after dying which is good, because some portions can be a little tricky.","November 22, 2015","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
