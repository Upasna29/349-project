It mostly depend on who you are, what kind of gamer you are.\n\nIf you are craving for an old school Fallout-like game, go for it, you probably won't be disapointed.\n\nBut it's 2015 now, and even if I think that some old games ( especially RPGs ) were a lot better in the past, it's not a reason to keep their flaws as current game mechanics, or even putting annoying stuff in a game on purpose. Some examples as a warning for potential buyers :\n\n- the tutorial only covers three things : using a gun, lockpicking, and stealth, because that's obviously the skills required for anyone living in this world. And then the game continues on that way, giving you the choice between a gun, a crossbow and a knife. Ok... but what if I did a Psionic character ? What if I didn't invest any point in ranged or melee ? Though luck, you start without any Psi ability. First you need to unlock your Psi potential by talking to a doctor, whom then leads you to NPCs who could maybe teach you some skills. The first one required me to have 35 and 45 points in Psi to learn stuff, but at level 1 you're capped at 15 points, so you need several levels before learning that. Another NPC only agreed on teaching me a single free skill ( need to pay for others ), AFTER I complete some quest requiring to kill rathounds with... a crossbow. Wait... what ? In order to have a single Psi ability I need to do a quest using a crossbow, but I have no points in ranged combat or crossbow and that's exactly why I need Psi stuff ?\n\nThat would be like starting as a mage in Baldur's Gate with 4HP, no spells, no companions and only a sword, forcing you to go melee until you can finally buy some expensive spell after 4 levels...\n\nOK, the game begins to punish you for picking anything else than the cookie-cutter gun/crossbow ranger or melee brute. Fine. Let's start over with a new character.\n\n- another thing is the total lack of map, making it a nightmare to navigate in the maze of metro tunnels. Characters just give you vague information about your destination like if you already knew the levels by heart, and the journal is of no help at all : "complete all the tasks for NPC X and come back to NPC Y". Yeah thanks... I love to wander aimlessly into labyrinths, killing mobs, wasting my ammo and heal.\n\n- merchants will only buy a certain ammount of a certain item, and nothing else. Like, this guy ONLY buys 2 leather armors and one pair of boots. You can stick all your other loot up your ♥♥♥♥... also, all merchants are cutthroats, I think the exchange rate is like 300% of the base price. HOWEVER some items like weapons have a really high price, and you will probably find enough of them to get a nice ammount of money early enough. I found/looted on ennemies at least 3 or 4 guns and 2 crossbows already, enough to cover my needs in lockpicks and some gear.\n\n- stealth is really stupid as your character's vision is really limited, so you won't be able to see anything past a corner for example. Mobs move really quickly compared to you, so good luck knowing if they are looking in your direction or not. Maybe they should have added some sound, or onomoatopeia to tell you  an ennemy is near ( like in the game XIII adapted from the comic, you can "see" the sound of ennemies step to locate them ). Because there is no way our character doesn't hear a big sentry bot coming his way from afar...\n\n- overall the game is really slow and boring, the character can't run of course.\n\n- the world seems really serious and there is not a single hint of humor like in Fallout or BG. instead the characters will KO you if they don't like your tone.\n\n- inventory is terrible, and some fonts are downright unreadable.\n\nGonna update this after I play some more. I can't "not recommend" the game despite its flaws, because I guess it's still a nice game, but some aspect will probably turn people off.\n\nEDIT : now some things I like about the game\n\n- there is a lot of loot and your inventory is not too small so you can take a lot of stuff. As you can't sell everything to any merchant you can stock your loot and crafting material in your appartment.\n\n- there is generally several ways to progress : stealth, lockpicking/hacking, brute force, dialogue, etc. For example you can use your lockpicking skill and an omnitool to unlock a ventilation shaft, or a crowbar and your stength. However doing a non-combattant character seems impossible, or at least really hard, as there will probably be ennemies you can't talk with blocking your path. Maybe if you max your stealth, lockpicking, hacking, persuasion and intimidation, and find/buy the right tools ( which requires either luck or knowing the game already to have what you need at the right moment ), AND if you're ready to reload a save a bunch of time to learn ennemies patterns to sneak successfully, yeah it should be doable.\n\n- graphics are nice enough\n\n- you can detect secret passages with a high perception. Not something you find in a lot of games.\n\n- the lighting affects stealth. When you step in shadows, your character portrait will go dark to tell you you're more difficult to spot. Trying to sneak in plain light won't end good. Fortunately most of those tunnels are dark.","December 19, 2015","true","15.8"," 233 of 262 people (89%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","89","233","262","12","11"

This is quite possibly the best RPG I've played since 1999.\n\nThe combat and character building is outstanding, and very balanced. There is essentially no filler combat, and the vast majority of encounters are really damn hard. The combat system uses a good variety of special attacks acquired through perks and appropriately rare single use items like special crossbow bolts, grenades or even caltrops to strategically tip the scales of a tough situation in your favour. Several encounters took me 3+ tries to get through. Cool downs between 2 and 5 turns make sure you can't just spam stims or a very powerful special attack to win.\n\nExploration is the second thing that stands out the most, along with combat. Stealth can get you places combat won't on several occasions, especially by using the black mesa developed technique of crawling through ventilation systems.\n\nOne of the areas you explore a few hours into the game stands out in particular to me, it's on par with genre classics like the Glow from Fallout, or Sierra Army Base from the successor. Those levels that are so well desgined that they feel like playing a Pen and Paper RPG with a good DM.\n\nIn a time where everything has to be a successor to something it's also really refreshing to see something do it's own thing. There's no "canon" to "break" for once. You've got your psi-abilities that reminds me of some PnP games I played a long time ago, a perk system reminiscent of Fallout, but with key differences, especially how you have to unlock things like aimed shot. Perhaps the subway civilization has also been done before. Despite all that it manages to feel really unique and innovative. For example, pretty much every single beast enemy you encounter has some kind of special ability, they're never just hit point bars with teeth. Even the equivalent of the Fallout rat sometimes comes with a leader of the pack individual that changes things up. The more difficult inhabitants of the caves will poison you as well as lay eggs that hatch more-than-annoying youngsters that swarm you at just the wrong time.\n\nThe game's economy also seems well balanced and interesting in terms of the crafting system.\n\nIf you like post apocalytic themes, turn based RPGs in the vein of the original Fallouts, that draw heavily on pen and paper rule sets, where your stats, tactical thinking and meticulous preparation matter and frantic clicking doesn't, you're sure to enjoy this game immensly.","April 21, 2014","true","614.2"," 124 of 129 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","124","129","0","7"

If you're a fan of the Fallout series in general, you won't be disappointed.\n\nLet's go over some pros and cons. Keep in mind, this list is not all-inclusive; just some of the plusses or minuses that immediately come to mind.\n\nPros:\n\n-Old-school feel with isometric camera\n-Interesting combat system using initiative to decide turn order\n-Many different character builds available, such as guns, crossbows, melee, unarmed, psi, and throwing. Within each weapon category there are different weapon types, and specialized feats assoiciated with them\n-Ability to avoid most or all combat situations if one wishes to play a diplomat-type character\n-Three difficulty settings, and two choices for how the main character gains experience. One favoring experience via exploration and quests (which reinforces the ability to play as a diplomat), and one favoring killing and quests.\n-Comprehensive crafting system\n\nCons:\n\n-Debatably difficult at the start of the game due to the tutorial only breaking the ice of the way combat mechanics function\n-Lack of in-game map\n\nYes, I have only listed two cons, the first of which is easy to over come with a little play-time. The second con, which is my only real gripe about the game, is that there's no in-game map.\n\nThis is an issue because there's very many zones in the game, which aren't labeled, and once you get away from the city and start transitioning through many zones, it can begin to almost feel like you're in a maze.\n\nHopefully something regarding the map will be addressed sometime in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, the amount of content in this game is staggering. The amount of value for the price of this title is off the charts. I HIGHLY recommend you pick this up if you're a fan of the older Fallout games, or are just a fan of isometric turn-based RPGs in general.\n","December 24, 2015","true","24.5"," 55 of 56 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","55","56","0","3"

It has a detailed and lovingly thought out game environment, crafting and combat system and most of all a great story backed up by memorable characters.\n\nYou have quite a bit of freedom in this game too - the introduction of the "oddity" leveling system is unique and tries (quite successfully) to allow the player to choose a "non-combat" approach to the game.\n\nHowever,  from playing through the available content thus far I have to say that the oddities are normally guarded by some enemy or even on their bodies. This kind of defeats the object of attempting to bypass combat as a means to level as you will normally have to fight to get the oddities in the first place. But the great thing about this game is that it gives you the choice whether to use that system or a more traditional, XP based system.\n\nWhen creating a character, the developer has made it possible and plausible to pick certain playstyles, adding to the replayability and allowing you to play the game in a number of interesting and challenging ways. The game is difficult but then I think this kind of game should be challenging.\n\nFreedom definately is the plus of this game, you can pretty much do whatever you want, even if that means doing something suicidal - the point is the game lets you.  I think this is a very important feature for any RPG. Also there is no "morality" system - the game niether rewards, nor punishes your actions, although some people may not take kindly to your actions - this is all fine and believeable.\n\nIn conclusion I recommend this game - it's absorbing, challenging and is one of the only early access games I've bought that has actually been finished.","June 11, 2014","true","284.6"," 61 of 67 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","61","67","0","2"

Great setting, atmosphere and world building. The settlements, NPCs, etc make sense within the gameworld.\n\n2. All the game systems are well designed - The character system, crafting, turn based combat, stealth, C&C, story, exploration and  XP systems are all well thought out.\n\n3. While the graphics are not pretty (they are adequate), the sound is excellent and really adds to the setting.\n\n4. The game is quite difficult (good), especially early on, and the difficulty curve varies depending on the character build (as each build has different strengths and weaknesses). As long as the player thinks through all available options for each encounter and uses their character's available tactical options, the difficulty is generally manageable. This aspect may turn off some players.\n\n5. Unlike fallout, the combat is more tactical and not easily exploitable, which helps maintain the challenge throughout the game.\n\n6. There are some areas where the game isn't as great: No pacifist approach & linear starting area sequence are a couple of examples.\n\n7.  Overall, the game is very stable and there is a lot of content.\n\n8.

This adds a bit of color and variety and improves one area the game was lacking. It still isn't gorgeous but there's much less to complain about and the art style comes off better.\n\nThe writing has been done up. Just enough flavor to make it more pleasant to read. It's a small improvement but a very important one.\n\nCharacters have been added or slightly altered. Areas feel more complete now. Music has been touched up here and there. A difficulty level (Hard) has been added and the game is complete now with all areas, characters and seemingly even more items and weapons.\n\nOverall it seems an already strong game has been tuned up and warmed up. Now it's time for you to play it. Enjoy.\n\nOne note: The early game is quite challenging and combat takes some getting used to.\nYou're not a hero. You're not going to take on an army and win. You're just a guy or gal. You may have some skills but you're still humble flesh and bones. Try to remember that.\n\n\nOriginal Pre-Release review follows:\nUnderrail is an indie game, and such often get a pass for not quite being up to triple-A standards. Some are lazy, other times it's a case of not having time and money. I'm happy to say that Underrail doesn't lack effort, though it does have a few rough edges and appears bush league in some ways.\n\nLet's get the negatives out of the way:\n\nThe on screen text can be very hard to read. It's very small and a strain.\n\nOccasionally it is frustratingly difficult to click on exactly what you want. It is a bit of a pixel hunt when you want to attack a creature but keep getting a movement path highlight instead. Some wire fence door can be tricky to close. There's 1 or 2 typos/grammar errors. All of this is fairly minor but worth mentioning. The game is not perfect.\n\nI found the music playing in the first area (SGS Base) a bit irritating. The loop is relatively short and some parts meant for the background become noticable. Again not very brutal, but shows a lack of polish.\n\nI also get the feeling many players will find the early game a little slow. The player character doesn't yet have developed skills but the early quests felt very much like an extended tutorial. It's fine in a way, because Underrail is quite a complex RPG (but not overly so) so having a slow-ish start helps. Fans of exploration will enjoy it much more so than fans of action.  EDIT - Some of the early dialogue felt very matter-of-fact and didn't seem very promising.\n\nThe graphics are decidedly not mindblowing. They're ok. I'm sorry to write this because it must have been hard work, but unfortunately the first impression isn't too great. It's all hand drawn and the overall aesthetic is consistent. There is nothing out of place or bland or terrible, but it shows a lack of high budget bells and whistles.\nI hate banging on about graphics and i should like to defend this game. I recently played Alien Breed - Something or other, and that is a great example of a very pretty game that gives me absolutely no joy nor pleasure. It's so boring, but very shiny. There's nothing wrong with it, but it's uninspired. I'd rather have less explosive visuals but with more individual detail, and a more interesting world to explore.\n\n\nAll of the above is fair for a game that lacks a AAA budget however. It's very stable, no lag whatsoever and the parts that are polished shine. The sound system is excellent for example.\n\nAside the small annoyance over one overexposed theme, the music has been excellent. Not just good but fitting, emotional and without fault.\n\nThe game is also very fast, which is one thing damn AAA games cannot bring themselves to achieve. No lengthy loading times or huge sys. requirements.\n\nSince Fallout 1&2 comparisons will be inevitable: Fallout 1 gave the player a clear goal and few directions but otherwise left them to take on the world as they want. Fallout 2 was more directionless but very rich. Esp. in death. And busting up casinos and doing drugs in New Reno. UnderRail so far gave me a starting point and clues on how i might get entangled in conflicts but has made no effort to restrain or railroad me, other than token baby quests which experienced players can ignore anyway.\n\nYes, some of the dialogue was very matter-of-fact but a few characters managed to stand out and show personality. And having played further into the game i don't think writing is UnderRail's highlight nor weakness. Stories advance through exploration and exploration is limited by character skills. I felt free to veer of the beaten path when i wanted and i think i appreciate that more than a well written railroad plot. Thus my tale is one of bare survival and luckless burglaries, but i did score a swank pair of powered gloves.\n\nCombat mechanics are complex enough yet remain basic and closely tied to skills. Get skilled and acquire better gear and you'll do more damage. Though if you dig deeper into it you can see why things like traps, crafted items or even bare hands have advantages. Traps wound and immobilise, caltrops or fire restrict movement and bare hands ignore 100% of energy shields, just as an example..\n\nNot sure i'm on board with yet another game with crafting in it, but it seems to be integrated well into gameplay and skills. One thing i am absolutely on board with is the Oddity XP system. Instead of rewarding actions that can be farmed and become repetitive, the optional Oddity system rewards XP for discovering rare items strewn across "dungeons". The harder the dungeon, the greater the rewards. Oddity items have no value otherwise and can only be used to gain XP (for studying the item). Your usual oddity may be some ancient orders given to a squad of troops, an unusual feature on monster remains or stuff like that.\n\nIt changes gameplay quite a bit. Since there's no way to earn XP in the usual way such as through dialogue, quests or using skills/murdering things. It can also make it a bit harder to get through an area for which you may not have adequate skills. Overall i like the change. Farming sucks and getting rid of it is a good idea. Once again, it's possible to select the Classic levelling system so if you don't like the sound of this, don't worry.\n\nBut do give it a try. It's refreshing to know that killing mooks or just doing mundane stuff gives no XP and just wastes ammo, healthpacks or similar things. I only do it when hostiles get in the way or i get cornered, as it should be. More tanky characters can still wipe the floor with them for funsies, but the Oddity system feels more like forging a path through a gameworld rather than pushing the right buttons in a game mechanic to advance.\n\nThe trading system is also different from the usual one found in RPGs. Instead of hauling a load of crap with you and hoping to swap it for less uselles crap, you'll find plenty of traders willing to barter with you, but they're very picky about what items they actually want. Fortunately they tell you what they want and it's usually general categories such as medicine or component types. It's a bit harder to buy the goods though, because you only have a fraction of your inventory value to offer.\n\n\nSo there's my review. I barely scratched the surface yet. I know there are imperfections but i don't care. The game has hooked me enough and i want more. This seems like a very interesting world to explore and the amount of items and skills that are available seems huge.\n\nI've played Fallout 1,2&3. All the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games and probably a million more post-apocalyptic games including Burntime! So i really should retire from post-apocalyptic gaming, but nope. This one is just as good, i'm loving it.\n\nRecommended RPG fans, both causal and hardcore. Exploration and survival fans will enjoy it even more.","December 12, 2015","true","91.2"," 46 of 47 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","46","47","0","4"

While that may seem trivial, the thing that pushes it into a negative review is that all of the baddies you've killed along the way have respawned because you opened the final area.  At this point, low on everything and just tired of all the wandering back and forth (a recurring theme in the game), I gave up and deleted the game (after 132 hours of gameplay, holy @#$% I played this thing for 132 hours!?!) .\n\nIn the end you have what could have been a very enjoyable game being ruined by several end stage "challenges" that are just end up being annoying and frustrating.\n\nP.S.:\n\nWhile the following few items were not enough enough for me to dislike the game, they did detract from the game.\n\n> And we're walking...\n\n> Level Cap: While I'm not a big fan of level caps, I can live with them.  However, if you are going to impose a level cap then you have to cap the rest of the game as well.  Example: "Wow, I could make this really cool <whatever> but since the crafting requirements are random and open ended and I didn't put OVER 150 POINTS into the needed crafting skill I can't" or "I thought a lockpick skill of 119 would be enough but look, a door that needs a skill of 120 to open it."\n\n> And we're walking...\n\n> Weapons Don't Keep Pace:  As you move through the game the bad guy's toughness out paces your ability to inflict damage.  This is especially true if you don't craft the right items.  This means you have more and more difficulty with the bad guys despite any increase in level.\n"Well that's the challenge." you say?  To that I say "No."  A combat against three different types of bad guys that requires three different types of defenses (and you can only wear one) and without the proper defense any one of the three can easily kill you in one round and your weapon can only dish out enough damage to kill one opponent each round...oh, and there's two of each type of bad guy.  Not a challenge, just a death and reload.\n\n> And we're walking...\n\n> Being Stalled By Quest Requirements:  This happened a few of times.  In order to complete a quest a specific skill at [X] level was needed.  Didn't think pickpocketing was important?  Better go wander off and find anything to level grind on for several hours to get the points needed.  Included in this would also be quest items that are difficult to find due to any number of reasons.\n\n> And we're walking...\n\n> Finally, and I admit this isn't a hardcore problem, if you are going to put something behind a 100+ difficulty lock then make it something better than some @#$%ing scrap metal.\n\n> And we're walking...","February 26","false","132.7"," 70 of 84 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","70","84","4","1"

If you can get past the first few missions and not make any critical build mistakes, you can create just about any type of char you want and survive.

This game is what I wanted Shadowrun Returns AND Fallout 3/Fallout NV to be. I'd say take Metro, mix with Fallout, add a heaping teaspoon of fallout 2; stir in a pinch of Thief 1/2, and finally add a hefty 1/4 cup of Deus Ex; stir; and then you would be fairly close to how awesome this game is. I put in 100 hours my first playthrough, and at that time the game was only about 10% finished lol (Armidillo Chip).\nI later put in over 60 hours getting to the Tchort part near the end.\nIt isn't often I log 160+ hours on a game, or even 100, and this game is probably the first indie game in which I have done so.\n\n\nAs it stands, almost completed, it is well worth as much as $30, and I had a blast! Most of my reviews on games are negative due to high expectations, but this game almost broke the 1-10 scale with 10+. UnderRail is destined to be a true masterpiece, and falls in place as one of my top 25 games ever in my 38 years of playing.\n\nI have put this game to bed temporarily because I am waiting on the full release, which will hopefully be sometime this year lol?

UnderRail breathes the much needed creative life into the world of games which seems so easily stagnated by copy/pasta SDKs and uninspired design.\n\nIf you enjoyed a lot of the older Interplay/Black Isle productions, Shadowrun (SNES/Genesis), Fallout Tactics and many of the other absolute isometric classics--UnderRail is definitely for you. The writing is excellent and already pushes the immersive environment even further. The game world, character build, world mechanics and interaction are all very large and of non-linear design with countless iterations.\n\nIn it's current early access state it is absolutely playable; with countless hours of enjoyable content and virtually bug-free game play.

It's a work of love from a developer who clearly deeply enjoyed the old Fallouts, XCOMs, Wasteland and Jagged Alliance, but due to todays technologies and an attention to detail, it's become so much stronger.\n\nExplore the caverns, passages, ruins and beating heart of the UnderRail; the underground remains of our future civilization, sprawled across the Metro system which has been beaten by time, scarred by combat and given refuge to competing groups, deadly enemies, politics, and scavengers, stragglers and survivors making their way.\n\nWith a fantastic combat system and range of very well designed traits and abilities, you'll constantly be learning and trying new things as you descend further into the world of the UnderRail, eventually finding the even wider and more intricate lower levels..\n\nHighlightsThere's a level of detail that brings everything up a level. Most characters and groups are unique enough to be interesting, oddities, mobs and items are all fun to read about, and the history of the world is scattered around waiting to be discovered\n\nCombat and abilities have been balanced strongly and never feel spammy, boring, or badly designed. Finding advantages and alternative approaches to a situation is encouraged, and keeps you thinking and involved throughout every encounter.\n\n* A fantastic lack of restriction and forced objectives/interactions means you can do whatever you want, pretty much from the get-go, even if it's stupid or suicidal, which helps add to the exploration and immersion\n* Fantastic combat and a deep yet balanced skills and abilities system mean that making new unique characters is easy, and fun, and lends to more replayability\n* Like Metro 2033, the setting is just right for the atmospheric sound effects and music. They match really well and help create stronger immersion\n* A useful crafting system and economy, which aren't overstated, help add depth for those who want to spend time on it\n* The long playtime with good pace and content throughout, and the heaps of re-playability deserve special mention\n\nMistakes* There's a strong lack of explanation and tutorial elements. The wiki helps, but new players can often go wrong with combat and other abilities\n* Small UI problems like text sizes, and the odd bug or two\n\nRecommendationsUnderRail is exceptionally well priced at just £6.49/7.99€/$9.99 at the time of review, though this has been rumoured to increase after release. With 60 hours+ playtime it's currently a must-buy for anyone who enjoys this genre.\n\n* Learning combat basics like kiting, positioning and when to heal will help you in the early stages\n* The regular experience system should probably be chosen by new players as the Oddities system requires more involvement\n* There's a Demo available for free on IndieDb\n* Potential expansions have been mentioned by the dev and may offer even more content some time after release\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/250520","June 21, 2015","true","14.2"," 35 of 36 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","35","36","0","1"

Expect to use all of your abilities and quickslot items to survive. Grenades, caltrops, special bolts, mid-fight healing.. All of it helps. Melee isn't the only option for stealth, since crossbows are included and ample within the game. Psi abilities for people that prefer wizard characters.\n- Choices and Consequences are not as impactful, but still there.\n- Skill Checks show fairly often for dialogue, and It's not only "persuasion" that is considered. Checks are based on thresholds, not randomly generated. With pickpocketing, you can only grab so much, not save-scum your way to riches.\n- Attributes are much more specialized towards what kind of character you want to play. Every attribute has its use, but you're not rewarded any extra skill or action points for choosing Intelligence or Agility.\n- Skills points are sparse; you have to sacrifice defenses, social skills, or crafting even if you only specialize in a single combat skill.\n- Feats and their requirements can all be displayed at the beginning of the game so you can plan accordingly. THERE ARE TONS, many being active skills and not simply passive boosts.\n- Companions do not exist.\n- Writing and humor are not as effective, but I have found myself chuckling here and there.\n- Crafting is extremely modular and well worth the skill points. You will not find the best equipment; crafting a stellar piece of armor will require investment into tailoring and mechanics. A good weapon will need mechanics and electronics. Feats can be chosen to further improve your creations.\n\nI'm always a sucker for the gameplay, but the artist work is top-notch. Every non-transistion area is gushing with attention to detail and many are beautiful. As an example, they even spent the time to make character portraits change background depending on the area you are in. The soundtrack works very well with the setting.\n\n10/10","January 3","true","142.5"," 37 of 40 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","37","40","0","0"

Combat is challenging and fun. I enjoyed the character I made, and there are different concepts that you can explore. Be tanky, be sneaky, be a mentalist with different combinations of crazy powers... different weapons, a complex crafting system, and a novel sci-fi world (it's all underground and what happened on the surface is almost a forgone conclusion.) This is a world I wanted to learn more about. Loose confederacies, mysterious agitators, independants, and powerhouse unions who want to control them all. The stat, perk and skill system are both familiar and fun -- you will look forward to levelling. I continued to play for progression even after I ran out of conent currently available, and that should say something. It was also fun for different reasons to fight as a lower level guy the same combats as a higher level guy. Wracking your brain for a way to win can be as fun as crashing through like a Rhino.

Wow, apologies for that convoluted mess of text.

So did I. Well, you know what? Jackpot baby.\nI've spent some silly amount of time in this title right here and... damn, the goodness is almost omnipresent. It will hook you more potently than Jet and keep you strapped, aching for more.\n\nLet me get started quickly. I simply love the atmosphere. I get lost roaming the rails, the caves, the tunnels, the abandoned warehouses - for no particular reason, just waiting for the next interesting encounter or nasty surprise down the road. I revel in the ambiental music, which picks up the pace smoothly when combat starts. The general theme is bizzaro-techno-cyber/steampunk depending on which area you're on. I fool you not, I had the feeling I was exploring the Hub, the Glow or some dark alley in Necropolis more often than not. There is also a strange coolness and attention to detail that usually defines everything: stylish art direction and intentional retro fitting. The gunshots have just the right kick to them, the echoes and screeching sounds in the caves are exactly the right fit. Even the neon flashes in the dump, gritty, grimy, depressing dread dystopic metro stations have the right sound to them.\n\n"More often than not" is the word to remember here. More often than not, Underrail gets things right; it delivers on atmosphere, combat and mechanics, exploration, inventory system, stats, skills and "perks" and quests. But let's not get ahead of ourselves.\n\nThe highlight piece of the game (but you should know this already) is the turn based combat system. Take Fallout's combat system and reimagine it into a more complex counterpart. Add cooldowns, movement points in addition to action points, interesting cloaking and hide in shadow mechanics and we've got a winner. To be honest, this is the most maturely developed turn-based combat system I've seen in a while in an isometric RPG. Hats off Styg, you've managed to outperform even established developers - Wasteland 2 for example doesn't even come close, in my view. Well, if you were to be extremely picky, you could say that a proper cover system is missing. Also, multi-level combat a la Jagged Alliance 2. Or, from the same game, ducking or going into prone positions. To Underrail's defense: remember this is not a tactical game with RPG elements (as much as it may seem at times :wink:) - but quite "au contraire".\n\nI'd like to say at this point that no matter what builds you'll be experimenting with, you are going to miss a lot without being at least partly invested in PSI abilities. Needless to say that mind-affecting abilities aside, those fire, ice, electricity and telekinesis attacks will just come in handy when dealing with a large variety of enemies, each packing a different flavour of resistances. The usual archetype builds you'll meet are the PSIchopath, chiller, firestarter, electronist, gunner, cutter or invisible stalker with a crossbow. Expect to meet anything in between. There are mostly two approaches when talking about defense: one, you can pack the heaviest suit of metal armor that you'll find and become essentially a tank (and try to resist almost every attack) but suffer movement, evasion and stealth penalties. Two, go as light as possible and invest in actually evading the bullets and dodging the cranium-targeted sledgehammers. By going with light armour, you'll keep your ability to be effective at stealth and make it your life's purpose to actually avoid getting hit in the first place. Now, the plus side to this approach is you'll attack first and surprise your enemies more. On the down side, expect to risk being put down by a single, well-aimed sniper rifle bullet, simply because your armour doesn't have the stopping power to withstand the mechanical impact. My views on defense are quite biased - to quote a line from a favorite game of mine, "neither view is balanced, but one is less unwise".\n\nSpeaking of enemies, a scavenger named Marty once told me that there be bandits around; robbers; raiders; outlaws; marauders; gangsters; criminals; crooks; thieves; railroadmen; thugs... his own words you know. Don't get me wrong; packs of rathounds, bugs, giant insects, lizards, spiders, or even robots - can be menacing in most situations, especially when they surround you or surprise you. However, *nothing* really compares to dealing with a roomful of human enemies, no matter what faction or allegiance. The fact that they can and *will* use the entire arsenal at their disposal and all the offensive capabilities that *you* yourself can, well, that makes them downright dangerous. At most times you'll have a chance to prepare for assault, which is tactical goodness right there. You can position yourself, hide in shadows or trap the room if your skill is high enough. Attacking first allows you to pick targets close together and blast them with grenades, EMP their energy shields or simply mass PSI them with fire, ice, electricity, telekinesis or mind-control abilities, instilling fear or mass enrage. Carnage is guaranteed and a lot of itemy swag will be left on the corpses, for pillaging purposes.\n\nNow, I don't know about you, but I love the an*l detail of items and inventory in general. If you've liked that in Jagged Alliance 2 for example, you'll know what I'm talking about.\nSo many items and none of them are really useless (pun intended: Wasteland 2). Pick 'em up, steal 'em, stack 'em, store 'em, trade 'em. I've been running around locker rooms managing items, choosing weapons, repairing and crafting. Not to mention selling in order to sit on mountains of ca$h. However, in no way is the game unbalanced on this (if more, it is very well thought, with merchants only having a limited amount of money at all times, refreshing the inventory every once in a while)\n\nIt is true that I would have liked more dialogue choices and consequences and it is unfortunate there aren't so many, as the potential for those to tie into the storyline is immense. There are, however, some events related to quests that offer multiple solutions and different approach routes, depending on skill and ability. Without spoiling it, I'm going to tell you that at some point you pick up a side quest to look into a particularly suspicious death. If a certain skill related to science is high enough, you will discover aspects of the death that would otherwise remain hidden. In turn, that generates additional dialogue lines that will offer quest closure via a fulfilling path. Thanks to true detective work and dialogue options, you must complete an entire puzzle: the suspect's background and affiliation, the weapon of choice used at the scene and a solid motive for the assassination.There will be areas in which you'll have the chance to explore multiple-path approaches a la System Shock II. For example, you could break into a rather important mansion at some point. High Agility allows for a climb via a steep balcony, overriding the need to hack the high-level electronic panel, which was kind of nice. I also sneaked my way into a metro station full of lunatics, in order to recover a stolen item for a faction. Not a single shot was fired, as the alternate route was to level the entire station in a gruesome battle. It's too bad that Underrail only offers these approach paths from time to time, so do treasure them when you see them because there aren't so many.\n\nConclusion time: just pick up this piece. You'll remember it for a long while and never regret it.\nWord on the street is there's also new content headed our way - maybe, just *maybe* Styg will play a riskier hand and it will turn out to be more content that develops interesting characters, quests, stories and dialogues. In my opinion, those are the areas most underdeveloped, but also full of potential to add more value into an already shiny gem.","February 13","true","191.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","24","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nossr50/recommended/250520/","nossr50","nossr50","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nossr50/","223 products in account","Absolutely wonderful, played at least 6~ different builds and spent countless hours.\n\nBefore reading further I'll give you a TL;DR of my review\n\nTL;DR: Probably one of the best isometric turn based fallout esque roleplaying experiences to date, interesting setting, countless dialogue choices, clever writing and conversations and events that change depending on what you have done as a player. This is one of the best games I have played in years.\n\n**THE GOOD**\n\n- Combat is insanely difficult: this is a game where it expects you to play smart and plan ahead or it gives you a rude awakening. This is the Dark Souls of isometric turn based RPGs. When you beat an encounter that seemed impossible it is extremely satisfying. Don't expect to waltz your way through even the simplest of encounters.\n\n- Combat is varied: you can beat encounters with magic (psionic skills), traps (landmines and the like), melee, ranged combat, etc. With some skills you can make enemies fight each other, run away from you in fear while you hurl icebolts at them or avoid combat completely by using stealth. I'm not sure how much of the game you could complete without having to resort to combat, but I'd reckon you could stealth past 95% of content instead of fighting it.\n\n- Oddity XP system: This is probably one of the most clever XP systems I've seen in an RPG, you are rewarded for finding oddities, items which when found reward a static amount of XP. You can find some oddities on the corpses of enemies, but most oddities are found by exploring the environment, breaking into locked doors and opening containers, basically you are rewarded for your skill build rather than only being rewarded for killing enemies. If this doesn't sound good to you don't fret, the game includes a classic XP system where you gain XP from killing enemies if you prefer that. With the Oddity XP system you will reach maximum level right around the end of the game.\n\n- Crafting: I wasn't expecting an interesting crafting system when I bought this game, but I was surprised to see you can basically construct items and equipment for specific situations. All items are made of components, things like leather and fabric, and these leather and fabrics come in many varieties with bonuses exclusive to them. For example when you use kevlar cloth as your fabric then you will be more resistant to bullets, if you swap that out with black cloth instead you will recieve huge bonuses to stealth. Expect to always be on the look out for higher quality components as you play to improve your gear, even at the end of the game you are always finding better components.\n\n- Story: I won't say much since I don't want to spoil anything, but there are multiple ways to proceed in the games main storyline, you can murder everyone in your path or ally yourself with the bad guys. In the end, its up to you and the choices you have made.\n\n- Immersion: If you do things that would make you famous, character and NPCs will react realisticly to this. I once leveraged my importance as saviour of the town to get alone time with a prisoner in their private prison, little did the prison warden know I had ulterior motives and was actually there to silence this prisoner. But it's not just that, say I didn't convince the warden to let me see the prisoner.. I could've broken into the prison completely stealth and accomplished my goal that way, and you can even break this prisoner out of jail instead of killing him. There are multiple ways to tackle a lot of the quests in this game, which is what makes it so interesting and in my opinion a good game.\n\n- The World: This is basically the Dark Souls of isometric RPGs in more ways than one, almost every area you explore seems to lead to two or even three more areas. It really feels daunting and endless, you can get lost in caverns, subway tunnels, and other places for hours. It is AMAZING. When you beat a quest that has you clearing out a dungeon for lack of a better word don't be surprised when you find two more paths that can lead to interesting places at the end of said dungeon. This game rewards exploration, and I'd almost say you're playing the game wrong if you don't spend hours exploring for the sake of exploring, especially with the Oddity XP system.\n\n** THE BAD **\n\nNo game is perfect, and I feel I'd be doing a disservice if I didn't share some of the things that might turn you off.\n\nDifficulty: This is both the selling point of the game for me and its biggest problem. This is such an immense huge RPG and you won't even see but a fraction of it if you don't play the game right. Early on in the game is a quest which leads you to a place called Depot A for example, this place will rip you a new ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ if you aren't ready for it, and you most likely are not ready for it. It took me hours to clear this place the first time I came here, I even had to make a new character because I realized my build wasn't combat oriented enough upon arrival here. The difficulty persists throughout the entire game, nothing is impossible but most encounters you run into will have to be avoided and returned to later when you are stronger. Some people may not like that, but it adds immersion to the world, you are not the biggest badass in the universe and the game lets you know, you can eventually become a power house but you will not be one for a very long time. I'm currently on my 5th character, and I think my odds of completing the game at this point are pretty good. But I rerolled a lot just to get to this point. You can spend skills wrong, you can make your character wrong, there is no respec available. Play carefully and plan ahead. With all this said, I'm playing on normal and there is an easy difficulty, hell there is even a hard difficulty...\n\nDeep Caverns: Now I don't want to fuss too much about this place since it would be spoilers, but at the very end of the game there is a quite long section of the game which is so different from the rest of the game and so much harder than anything before it that it might just drive you mad. With that said you won't be anywhere near the end of the game for at least 20-40 hours.\n\n** IN CONCLUSION **\n\nDo you like difficult isometric RPGs with heavy story and great writing?\n\nYes?\n\nWhat are you waiting for?","January 19","true","185.8"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

To me it feels like you are living the life of someone just trying to survive and find their way in a post apocalyptic world.  The high point for me is crafting system.

Starts off slow, and gradually builds suspense.\n- Diverse and interesting combat build choices\n- Retro graphics that are just ugly enough to look like actual old-school grapics, but good-looking enough that you never have any trouble understanding what you are looking at\n- Tons of characters with lots of dialogue, for the most part very well written (though I have seen other reviews say the exact opposite)\n- Fun and challenging combat system\n- Crafting skills that are actually good\n- Very cool and immersive atmosphere\n- Very good soundtrack, think Fallout1&2-esque ambient music(sorry, Fallout had to be mentioned eventually)\n- Diverse quests, ranging from "kill these guys" to "infiltrate a base and help a prisoner escape" to "do detective work to solve a murder", and everything in between\n\nThe parts you might not like:\n- Large and at times maze-like underground layout with no ingame map. Some people like this, some people don't. Expect to get lost every now and again, but also expect to discover flavourful nooks of the game world that aren't necessary to progress, yet offers something\n- Backtracking, lots of it\n- Quests that really do not hold your hand, with somewhat limited information on the wiki should you get stuck\n- Min-maxing of attributes and skill points to some degree mandatory for a successful character\n- Endgame can be confusing, daunting, and has even more backtracking, but is very interesting in atmosphere and dramaturgical escalation. I spent a good hour reading computer chatlogs in an abandoned research facility, completely absorbed by how each conversational fragment shed more and more light on what exactly was going on there, but never quite giving it away. The best stories are often told by having your imagination fill in the blank spots. This is a cool storytelling technique that has every player end up with their own favoured interpretation of events.\n\n\n\nThe conclusion: If you are looking for a CRPG with a very good story, good atmosphere, good and challenging combat, no hand-holding, no quest markers, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, get this game.\n\nIf you are looking for a game with any of: polish, modern graphics, fast travel, clear unambiguous quests, forgiving combat, voice acting, cinematics, not having to read a lot of text, realtime combat, this game might not be for you.\n\nSeriously though, buy this game. It might be my personal GOTY for 2015.","April 27","true","98.4"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","21","22","0","2"

If you're a fan of isometric greatness or even just RPGs in particular, I'd totally suggest Underrail as a purchase. The character creation process has a lot of options, but not so much that your head will explode. Enough however that no two of your characters will ever be the same. Unless you do it on purpose to spite me, in which case...well played, sir or madam.\n\nA solid selection of weapons and modifications for them, as well as the variety of armor. The use of Psionics as opposed to magic in most games is fun, and quite potent as well. Plenty of space to move around in and not so much that you find yourself nodding off hauling a bag of blood covered shiny things back to an outpost. The Alpha status honestly shouldn't even be there, as the game itself has more to offer than most released games!\n\nThere's even a neat little experience system unique to the game based on your research and gained knowledge of certein enemies and the past around you, but also the option to kick it old school and get experience from actions and combat. Smoothe gaming, minimal bugs (and none game breaking either,) and a when they update they do nothing but throw greatness at us.\n\nSupport these guys, the game and the group are worth it. They took an old idea and made it their own, it's a beautiful thing.","July 5, 2015","true","114.8"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

The game conjures that magic spell that I remembered from so long ago, that feeling of being a lone wanderer in a strange world discovering its quirks and culture.  Unlike the modern Fallouts you are not a hero of renown or suddenly promoted to the head of an organisation you just found out about within the last 10 minutes, you're more of a drifter travelling the world and discovering settlements and people who don't really care if you live or die - but - if you could go and explore that abandoned warehouse full of Rathounds and Sentry Bots that'd be super cool, thanks.\n\nThink Fallout, think Deus Ex and Thief even - this game is the real deal, it's fun to play and explore in a richly detailed world.  The creator of this game (One guy!

I really wanted to believe all these glowing reviews but I think many people are looking at this game through rose tinted glasses.\n\nWhats good: The combat sound effects are nice and impactful. The combat itself is decent, not amazing but good. There are a large number of skills that can be learned. There is a unique level up system that can be interesting (not sure I love it but I am sure many will). There is an almost overwhelming number of items to be found and used in the game (for crafting, tools, weapons, etc.).\n\nWhats not great: You are an army of one, there are no followers or companions in this game (that I have found anyway). There are many weapons...but you wont be able to use most of them AT ALL initially because there is an arbitrary skill level requirement in place... a skill level requirement even for basic assault rifles that you wont hit probably until level 5-6. The combat is HARD for a newbie. You will quickly run out of low level creatures to level up on in the starting area and if you wont develop your character perfectly you will need to start over as you will get stuck, unable to defeat the more powerful enemies in surrounding areas.\n\nWhile the combat is fun it is missing some things that would make it great, such as a cover mechanic, or positions like prone or crouched. Most enemies will make short work of you, even with good armor and a decent weapon you will get overwhelmed by numbers quite often. It is very easy to wander beyond the confines of what your character can handle without the most thoughtful and dedicated build. I appreciate challenging combat but it would be nice if there was a mix of challenges, rather than everything being in ♥♥♥♥ mode.\n\nThe economy is poor, shop keepers will charge outrageous prices for staples like bullets and bandages. We are talking like trading your pristine handgun, a set a armor, and a substantial amount of money for like 10 bandages or a handful of bullets. Additionally, shopkeepers wont take just any old thing in trade, only certain items that they want or need. That means you need to find a specific shop keeper to get rid of junk, or you wont be selling it at all. Mercantile skill does not seem to help either, perhaps not working yet?\n\nThe story so far is underwhelming me. In fact there doesnt seem to be much of a story at all, just missions that you do for your home base. However I am going to reserve judgement here as I have only gotten to the Junkyard which I assume is pretty early in the game. Similarly though, the dialogue seems pretty limited and I dont seem to be building any interesting relationships with...well ANY of the characters in the game. This also might be something that opens up later on, so I am reserving judgement there too for the moment.\n\nThe graphics are intentionally retro. I am neutral on this wave of "authentic" old school graphics in games, it doesnt bother me but  I also dont kneel down and praise the limited pixel gods when I see them. I personally would prefer more colorful graphics and more/better character animations but I dont think the gameplay is hampered by them. All in all graphics seem to hold up conistently through the different characters and locations in the game which is nice.\n\nI was not a fan of the music so I turned that down low after not too long. It wasnt bad, just a bit repetitive and not really my style.\n\nThis has the potential to be a really excellent game, its just not there quite yet.","October 8, 2015","false","12.9"," 127 of 208 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","127","208","2","12"

I was looking for that retro-looking style with the modern mechanics so much needed after years of gaming that undoubtely evolved in that direction.\n\nI needed to play a revisited, improved version of Fallout 1 & 2.\n\nThat's what Underrail is NOT. Whereas It takes what is good of this serie (and many others, but we are bound to look in that direction, I guess), it drags it into its own (not so innovative, yet quite fascinating) world, with its lore and claustrophobia.\n\nIt got me because:\n\nThe underground playground created by Stygian is quite everything I had been hoping for a sci-fi/cyber punk inspired game: it has the freedom, the rpg-oriented gameplay, the beautifully made (and I mean, astonishingly beautifully) crafting system, a skill/features system that finally makes some sense (yet it could be quite punitive if one fails to grasps the basic chemistry between certain stats and perks), no voice acting (bad?) and extremely intresting and fun dialogues.\n\nThe vendor system? Brilliant. I read some complaining about them merchants being too picky for someone who's living underground. Well, I'd say that being the one with the goods in a decayed environment, I'd be the mean ♥♥♥♥ deciding wheter to buy or not your rusty shovel - and I probably would not.\n\nSomeone else is not entirely cool with the respawn system either.\n\nTo be fair, I actually had not realized how good this was was before reading these complaints. They had me thinking about it, and only then I realized how balanced, effective and yet realistic the gimmick was: simply put, if you kill a bandit, a robot (basically, anything that does not breed in the open, or at all), you will have their rotting remnants tainting the soil for quite a long time (litterally, you'll have to stride on your victims decayed body over and over), without them respawning EVER (at least for my previous 30+ hours of game), while killing vermins will not prevent their progeny to harass you on your next stroll in their neighborhood.\n\nBeacuse, you know, scavengers DO lay eggs, rats DO have hidden nests, and so forth.\n\nAnd this is just plain brilliant. Unlike the africans in Far Cry 2, which according to ubisoft, lay eggs in their camphounds.\n\nTechnically speaking, the graphics are nothing special, if nothing at all, yet they manage to get you inside the world of Underrail effectively. I daresay that they work just as fine as those in Project Zomboid, which never failed to scare the ♥♥♥♥ out of me regardless of their pixelated windowpanes.\n\nIt got me despite:\n\nThe game could and should be more fast paced under certain aspects: the character has no means of running or using some "ride" to get to places quickly. Yes, you get faster spending points in certain skills, but imo you stay way too slow throughout the game.\n\nAnyway, this works just fine with the overall "groove" of the game (and for once, you don't have your toon jogging his whole time through the entire game like a crazed marathon man), I'd just like it to be a little faster.\n\nThe AI is really smart, and the encounters with the NPCs could have presented a real challenge, was it not for the fast load function: I run through apparently desperate and overwhelming situations just by sheer luck; namely, I put tons of mines and granades between me and those trying to stop me, and load after load I got them all where I wanted them to come.\n\nBeing a "one-man-army" kind of game this is easily acceptable and understandable, but I cannot fail to see the lack of tactical depth in such a move, which I delibartely used many times to go past otherwise unsolvable situations. I think of a game like Serpent in the Staglands, where no matter how fast (or not) you loaded from the bloody corpses of your comrades, you had to think of something better than a Save File to beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of that pack of foxes.\n\nNot that SitS is anywhere close in enjoyability to UR, but that gets you to the point.\n\nNavigating in the game could be a little frustrating (you will quite often struggle to point your cursor where you want due to the isometric nature of the game), but thankfully the highlight button helps in lessening this nuissance. It does fix it completely, but maybe having being able to change angle could have been a nice entry, too.\n\nI unfortunately had my previous save files corrupted by the realease of the final version of the game (oh dear, an early access which actually delivers?!), reason enough for me to stay quite silent about the story that, anyway, didn't seem too interesting or inspired. The world and everything works, just beacuse of the gameplay and the beautifully dark and oppressive feeling of the whole  thing, the EU/NATO kinda of thingy going on down there is really well thought (unlike, imo, in METRO2033), but the reasons why you are doing everything? To me, that really did not matter.\n\nOverall, I'd say that this game is a precious gem with some venial takedowns.\n\nKeep in mind that this review was made playing the the early access version of the game, I'll update as soon as I get to play the final version.\n\nBut, having been that good before the final release, can you fetch yourselves an excuse not to buy it now?\n\nedit. typos","January 11","true","43.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

The engine is a bit janky, yet serviceable.

Gameplay feels quite a bit like the first 2 Fallout games, with Action Point turn-based combat making a comeback.\nIt's astounding how many different ways you can play through the game with different character builds. You can smash your way through the game using melee weapons, take out your targets from a distance with sniper rifle or sneak up on them with a dagger, craft and use traps, bombs, cloaking and shield devices. Heck you can even use your mind powers to bend the enemies to your will or burn them alive. It's all up to you.\nThe underground world is pretty big and full of dangers, shady characters, competing organizations and political powers, gangs and cults. the dangers you encounter range from mutated rat-hounds and weak, mind-broken humans to psychotic, mindless androids with psychic powers.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/recommended/250520/","coaldust-numbers","Coaldust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coaldust-numbers/","235 products in account","This game bears a superficial resemblance to the first two Fallout games, but I found it too frustrating to enjoy.\n\nIn short, the game should have had better writing, and been more forgiving and less random.  It also has a bad user interface, and obnoxious sound direction.  Read on if you want details.\n\nRemember Fallout 1 and 2?  When you do you probably recall lots of dark humor, memorable characters, and 50s retro-futuristic camp.  There's none of that here.  The closest you'll come is a line of outlandish dialog once every few hours of play.\n\nThere are a lot of feats that have interesting effects and synergize.  Don't get too excited.  Most character builds will not work.  When I say “not work” I mean that about 5 to 8 hours into the game you will reach a point where you die repeatedly no matter what you do.  I had to restart 3 times until I came up with a build that “works”.  Most issues relate to inadequate defense.  The game allows exactly 2 defensive options to work: stealth and social skills to avoid most combat, OR having a massive hit point pool, heavy armor, and a powerful shield to facetank.  Dodge and Evade work great against melee and ranged attacks, and passably against area of effects, but you cannot dodge or evade psi attacks, and characters with a Will of 10 or higher can still expect to be 2- or 3-shotted by psi users throughout the game, so Resolve is useless.\n\nI hope you want to play a crossbow user or gunslinger with 10+ Perception, or a character with high Traps skill, because otherwise you're going to be saving and reloading every few steps eventually, when the ground is peppered with land mines.  If you insist on not using a build like this, craft a pair of Detection Goggles as soon as you get a chance.  I hope you don't mind the ability, skill, or head slot tax!\n\nThe crafting system is pretty good.  Be glad that it doesn't suck, because most builds are going to be forced to use it.  Certain kinds of items seem to never drop or become available from vendors, like tactical vests or riot gear made of psi beetle carapaces (which are basically required by psi-dependent characters).  Also, without crafting you won't have a use for about 80% of the loot you get.  I hope you don't mind this massive skill point tax further restricting your character building.\n\nLets say you chose stealth and social skills.  At first stealth is completely non-functional.  Even if you put as many points as allowed into it at the beginning, literally everything will spot you in ‘stealth mode’.  Soon it becomes overpowered and you can stand in front of someone in a well-lit room and them not notice you unless you bump against them.  You need not act stealthy.  There are no interesting disguise, distraction, or movement options for stealth.  As for the social skills, the checks are set about 5x too high (relative to the level at which you normally get the quest), so upon getting ‘stuck’ on a social skills check you will need to stop and make progress on other quests to level up enough to pass the check.  Such fun!\n\nThe combat is surprisingly shallow for a turn-based game.  That is a pity, since a role-playing game with weak plot, character design, and social interaction, only has combat left, and there is a lot of combat in this game.\n\nYou must always use the following combat tactics:\nalways initiate combat yourself (on non-stealth builds this usually requires dieing once to know it's coming)\nthrow an EMP grenade first if the enemy has shields\nbe sure you can close the distance to them if you use melee attacks, or outrange them if you use ranged attacks\nbe sure you can stun enemies every other round (they are immune for 1 round after)\nIf this sounds terribly cheap, be aware that enemies will do this exact thing to you, given the chance!\n\nThere are no postures (like kneeling or crawling) to affect chance to hit and be hit at cost to movement, and there is no cover system, so positioning rarely matters.  If you can see an enemy, it can probably hit you (and will probably initiate combat if you haven't already).  Sometimes you can move in and out behind an obstruction to avoid retaliation for a round or two.  The environment is not destructable (with the exception of TNT to remove fallen rocks outside combat), so you can't control the shape of obstacles.\n\nFights you win will last about 2 to 3 rounds.  The victor is usually determined by whoever initiates the fight (not clever tactics), since they usually get 2 rounds of free hits, because they will use a stun on the first round.  This is because the enemies are almost as strong as you, and fight competently, but you will be fighting 3 to 6 of them at a time, most of the time.  That, and the designer apparently thinks players enjoy having half their turns taken away by stuns almost every single fight, and players using melee love being immobilized for many rounds frequently by ranged characters.\n\nPlayers that think a feat tax can make you exempt from the incessant stuns should be aware that Thick Skull does not stop all stuns (e.g. Incapacitate from Sentry Bots).  Locus of Control seems to, but only for 3 rounds, and its requirements make it only available late-game and only to psi-dependent characters.\n\nEven if you make all the right decisions, its easy to lose due to the random number generator.  Since you must kill most or all enemies quickly you will be using expensive (in money, action points, and/or psi point pool) attacks, and if one misses, you've probably lost already.\n\nThis game has great replayability!  Expect to be reloading from your last save a lot.  Save frequently!\n\n“Easy” mode only gives you more hit points.  More hit points won't solve these problems.\n\nThere are a handful of other annoying design decisions, that I could have tolerated on their own:\nThe vendors are awful.  Not only do they only buy items similar to what they sell (which would have made some sense), they only buy a very small number of each type of item they sell per real life hour.  They also only have a very small amount of cash (which also takes a real life hour to refresh), which means if you have an expensive item to sell, and they have nothing you can use, you can't sell it, at least without taking a massive loss.  You'll be taking a massive loss with vendors anyway, since their profit margin is somewhere around 500%.\nConstantly running out of lock picks and batteries for your “Haxxor” is not fun.  It's bad enough that Lock Picking and Hacking are essentially more skill tax for anyone that wants to complete most missions.  They can't be used for anything creative, and take no skill to use.\nWaiting for several minutes (not exaggerating) for acid pools to dissipate to be able to cross an area is grating.\nEven if you put all your points into using psi, you will have to abuse area transitions to refill your psi point pool and reset your cooldowns.  Your psi point pool refills too slowly in combat, and there is a (needless) long cooldown on psi boosters and most psi abilities.  Have fun facetanking that free round the enemies get when you go back.\nThere are also some UI problems:\nYou can't see things behind obstructions.  The best you can do in Underrail is hold Tab down to see text descriptions of everything, then scrub the mouse over the area until you can find the invisible clickable location.  Foreground walls and other obstructions should turn semitransparent when your character can see behind them, as in Diablo.\nThe user interface is uncomfortably small at maximum size and modern resolutions.\nThere is no automap, and the world is a huge underground maze, so it needs one.\nUnless you like buzzing florescent lights and houseflys, I recommend setting the volume to 0% on this game.","January 17","false","148.2"," 49 of 73 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","49","73","2","9"

Basic grammatical errors are everywhere. Do people who don't know the difference between its and it's grind your gears? Prepare to wear those gears down smooth.

A lot of the directions NPCs give you are next to worthless and you'll be searching guides just to figure out where the entrance to your next mission is.\n\nThat said, I can't stop playing for some reason. The writing can be utterly laughable, but it's also, somehow, at times far better than anything Bethesda has put out in the past 10 years. Sometimes the quests can be infuriating, but at times they're a ton of fun and obviously carefully considered. The level design is also pretty great, barring locked chests that contain nothing. The devs have also experimented with a new experience system that's actually really nice, and the gameplay mechanics are, so far, relatively balanced and enjoyable. The difficulty level is just about perfect as well if you enjoy tough fights.\n\nIt's a diamond in the rough, really. Some of the writing is actually quite enjoyable. Some of it is actually great and had me laughing hysterically. I've heard the game's writer speaks English as a second language, so I can forgive all of the grammatical errors. I can even forgive the spots of cringey adolescent writing due to the spots of really great writing that you just don't see anymore in triple A gaming.

Nowadays, games focus too much on action sequences...press "A" repeatedly to break the dog's neck!  However, UnderRail doesn't worry about overrated things like graphics, action sequences, DLC, and other forms of gaming garbage that have become rampant in the industry.\n\nUnderRail is about as old school as it comes (like everyone has already said, think isometric Fallout 2) in CRPGs today.  The combat system is solid, and it fits well with the "Feat" system.  If you are familiar with Fallout's "Perk" system or Elder Scrolls' similiar system, then you'll see that UnderRail has basically that same exact thing built into character creation.\n\nNow, one of the most unique things about UnderRail is that, instead of doing quests and killing things to get experience and level up, you can opt to play the game without that traditional "grinding" to level system in place.  If you choose to play the way the developers intend, then choose the "Oddities" option.  Basically, this means that in order to gain levels and develop your character's stats and feats, you will need to find oddity items throughout the game.  These might drop from monsters after a kill or be hidden in a crate in a dark and dangerous room.  Playing with this leveling system enabled will make you explore places that you might not normally take the time to delve into, and it keeps you constantly looking for that one extra item so that you can get another level.  Personally, this is the only way I play after they added it into the game.  Keep in mind that if you prefer the classic "kill monster, get experience points, repeat and level up" system, then you can totally do that.  Nobody will judge you for your poor, poor choices...we promise...maybe...\n\nI rarely take the time to write reviews...but if story, gameplay, and a genuinely well thought out leveling and character progression system appeals to you...if you miss the difficulty of computer games from days past, then this is one of those diamonds in the rough that I would highly suggest picking up.","November 6, 2015","true","232.1"," 21 of 25 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","21","25","2","0"

Its writing isn't as good, but the Steam achievements sure are funny (Dirty Harry reference, for example). The writing isn't as bad as you may think, as I've encountered zero gramatically incorrect sentences in the conversation system so far.  The game definitely has cleaner graphics than Fallout. I also have to commend the sound design. It is very top notch for a game in Alpha stage of its development.\n\nI do have some problems, though.\n\n1. Lack of fast travel to explored areas.\n2. A lot of back-tracking. I found myself coming back to every floor in the beginning of the game to see if each of the merchants wanted my stuff (they're picky, realism at its worst).\n3. The game also crashes sometimes, but it recovers fast.\n4. NPCs don't show up until you get close to them. WTF? If there isn't any object blocking your vision (windows don't count, they're transparent!), then you should be able to see the NPC.\n5. Convoluted currency system.\n\nNow, you may be thinking, "Gee, that's a lot of deal-breaking problems. Why should I get UnderRail?" Well, the pros noticeably outweigh the cons.\n\nEDIT: I haven't played this game in a while, so I'm not sure if the developer has solved some of the 5 problems I listed above, broke it or made some other dumb business decision. I also am aware that frequent updating is an important thing for early access players. So far as I know, the game has only one developer, and he updates it infrequently.","March 28, 2014","true","5.7"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

It takes the single character rpg formula seen in Fallout 1/2 and truly refines and improves it without compromising the complexity and depth expected of an "old school" game.\n\nCombat in Fallout 1/2 was fun thanks to its colorful gore, npc taunts and that falloutesque je ne sais quoi quirkiness but it very much lacked in tactical depth and tools that would add diversity and options to one's violent encounters. In addition, old Fallouts had loads of skills but many of them (namely non combat ones) felt underutilized and therefore unsatisfying to take. There was also no crafting in a post nuclear wasteland where survival, salvage and improvisation would've been very important.\n\nUnderRail resolves the above flaws by adding a vast array of tactical options like activated and passive abilities, weapons that really work differently and require building your character around them, psychic abilities, equipment like combat drugs, tasers, NV goggles, cloacking devices, shield emmiters, mines, flashbangs, poisons, etc., a functional and useful stealth system that has both combat and non combat utility as well as a robust and detailed crafting system that is actually useful but not necessary in case you don't like crafting (it's yet another thing that becomes part of your character build or not).\n\nSkills are all useful (not equally of course) but also require careful consideration not just in terms of the skills themselves but also how they synergyze with your feat/perk and equipment choices. Long term planning is important. Character building is very detailed and definitely a strong point of the game. You don't just make a melee character or a ranged character. You make a specialized sledge hammer wielder, or a pistolier that combines one handed firearms and riot armor with shields or a sneaky, trap laying crossbow using poisoner, or a "monk" that combines unarmed martial arts and psi abilities. How about a scary, paranoid, crazy scientist with acid firing pistols, plasma guns and mind controlling psi who melts both bodies and minds? It's a character builder's dream with skills, feats and equipment all beautifully designed and integrated to allow for all sorts of specialized and hybrid builds.\n\nWriting in UnderRail tends to appear functional and spartan at first but as I explored the game I found quite a bit of humor and elaborate descriptions of characters many of which are interesting in their own way. It's a post apocalyptic, underground, cyber-punky setting so many characters are pragmatic and to the point but not all and the game is not unkind to fans of text and story. There's a good amount of quirky characters and setting specific colloquialisms and expressions and bits of lore and background to discover if you care to. It's just that immersion requires a bit more of one's own effort like rpgs used to, it's not served up with voice acting and fist person perspective. The writing does suffer from a large number of typos though (at least at the time of me writing this).\n\nOne very interesting aspect of UnderRail is it offers two experience systems at character creation. The "Classic" one is what you see in almost every rpg out there but with the "Oddity" system you get no xp for killing or using skills like lockpick, only for solving quests and collecting oddities which are all sorts of strange or old world objects that you can study to advance your character. The oddity system rewards stealth, exploration, social skills and non-combat solutions and works remarkably well, both systems do and make for a welcome option.\n\nUnderRail is not an easy game, normal difficulty actually provides a stiff challenge. There are no quest markers, no maps (only a compass), charging recklessly into battle will often get you killed. It's a game where secondary tools and consumables are actually useful and required, not just something you hoard and never use and it's my top RPG for 2015.\n\nPS: Svaka ti čast Styg.

The market changes though and your stored goods become favourable eventually. Ingenius as it does not make your character have too much capital to begin with.\n\nI'm looking forward to the end-product as they still have to iron out bugs (eg. drop outs when transitions between some areas needing a reboot) and  certain features of your character developmet (ie pickpocketing is a farce and melee seems a little off-balance with ranged)\n\n7/10","March 27, 2015","true","73.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","0"

Character specialization building is a must to progress without running headfirst into a brick wall. I started over several times because I wasnt familiar with the game world. It will happen to you as well. Min/maxing your character comes with experience of what to expect. If that bothers you then you will have to make a descision if that is a deal breaker.\n\nOddity/Classic experience system. Oddity means you find things to "study" that give experience instead of the "classic" way of killing things to earn exp. This essentially means that you do not have to build your character solely for combat, but combat is still a focus. You will fight, but it allows for more varied play-styles.\n\nGraphics are retro, but well animated. Quirky, but I would argue full of soul. The devs really put their heart into this game.\n\nThe story was well thought out. Very logical and consistant, but only truly makes sense if you take the time to do things properly and I mean that certain outcomes of questlines will yield different results. You can fail quests and you can come across surprising results.\n\nEndings change base on your actions. Similar to the Fallout 1-2 games.\n\nMusic repeats itself retro style over and over, but I found the music designed very well. It was made in a way that fits where you are. Very well done.\n\nGame is very long. Seriously. 50-100h on average depending on how quickly you do anything, but rushing is actually detrimental for a first playthrough in this game. You WILL miss things and it WILL screw over potential gains for the ending and for quests. I know this firsthand.\n\nThis game is built for nostalgia and for a new adventure. It is well worth the cheap price of 15 dollars. Frankly, I think its worth more. The game isnt for everyone, no, but if your tired of the crappy hand-holding experience you get with the more modern RPGs and want to try something a bit oldschool, but still modern concering isometic tactical RPGS, then give this one a try.\n\nHell, taking your family out to the movies would be more expensive. That alone makes this worth the price.\n\nIts worth it. Good game.","January 1","true","147.6"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Old review that was written after ~10 hours in game is placed below.\n\nSo, the only cons of this game are roleplaying system, basically slightly revised old Fallouts' system, and crafting system. They are interesting and engaging, no gripes.\n\nBut the game is ruined by its gamedesign and narrative. It has huge territory and very few quests, and almost all of them located inside a few hubs. No kidding, 90% of game world is an endless labyrinths of look-alike caves/labs/stations with no quest-related content; pure dungeon-crawling and grinding. But in some cases you could actually break quests if you would explore certain locations too early, so you have to grind with caution and check the playthrough before entering another abandoned facility.\nSo, time distribution of my ~170 hours in game feels like this:\n- 40% - lengthy logistics runs through empty locations between loot stashes and merchants (it's a chore even inside the hubs)\n- 40% - grinding in the caves/abandoned facilities/subway lines for the reward of couple of level-ups and two broken quests.\n- 20% - completing actual quests (which are also sometimes has troubles with design and backtracking for the sake of backtracking).\n\nAnd the narrative is just plain bad in every aspect. I can't remember the names of majority of the characters that I'd met week ago, all of them are completely one-dimensional, and the lack of unique portraits/models for them doesn't help as well. Main storyline is "go there, check WTF is happening" without any real motivations behind it. And the world lore could be fully expressed in one sentence: "Postapocalyptic (what was the apocalypse, BTW?) underworld community was dominated by one megacorporation that fell apart (reasons for that is also unknown)".\n\nI give up, this game is bloated with low-quality filler content beyond any reasonable limits. I've tried.\n\n6/10, for die-hard fans of dungeon-crawlers with RPG elements.\n===================================================\nOld review:\n\nWell, it's not from the same league with Fallout 1-2 and recent Shadowrun games, but still a decent RPG.\n\n- Loot variety and crafting system are quiet deep. Non-combat stuff feels more diverse.\n- Skills and perk...ahem, I mean, skills and feats with cross-related synergies are nice, too.\n- Sometimes it actually delivers that 'post-apocalypse in cyberpunk-ish underworld' feeling which is meant to be here.\n- All of the above-mentioned traits are enough to trap you for a long time here.\n\nBut:\n\n- Exploration and scavenging are way more interesting than grinding in fights, though it's still inevitable. So there's a bright side and a downside in that. It falls in the same trap where most of single-hero RPGs eventually ends up - you will stuck with your character build, and, therefore, general combat abilities and tactics for a dozens of hours, and variety of tools helps with it only partially. But they had tried.\n\n- There are two systems for gaining xp: combat-based and exploration-based. BUT you can't use both, had to choose one of them at the start of the game. Weird decision, because half of the character traits automatically became less useful. Merging it into one mechanics with little rebalancing would add even more depth.\n- Story, world-building, quests, dialogues and characters are 'meh' at best.\n\n7,5-8/10","December 19, 2015","false","171.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","4"

I put in 173 hours of gameplay into this game and finally beat the game. It was a thrilling adventure. If you like games like fallout and isometric rpgs, this is the game for you. It's a bit of a hardcore RPG, but if you want to put in long hours to think hard about how to beat a game, this IS THE game.\n\nStoryline\n\nThis game has great story, much better than some triple A RPG titles. And the mechanics are quite deep too. Usually, I wouldn't have so much after-thought about a game, but this game was different. The game didn't quite progress in the way one predicts in a typical computer game. Rather, it keeps going, bringing you deeper and deeper into its strange universe. The various factions and people had in-depth character and makes you wonder why are the way they are. There was also something mysterious about all the Oddities that can be collected, making you wonder in mysterious ways how they came about. When it was finally over, I felt that I have went through a great deal, and a strange sense that it was finally over for me.\n\nGame mechanics\nReally nice. There's so much to be experienced just from crafting and getting bigger and better weaponary. It makes players really think hard about what tactics they would use to defeat a certain enemy. I would expect a wider variety of energy weapons, though. The shields idea is a really good one. The usefulness of psychic and melee abilities is really fund to make use of in certain situations.\n\n<b>Complaints</b>\n*Spoilers*  There needs to be some mechanism to get around bad character builds. Tchort is very hard to defeat given a too rounded character. Once a player is leveled max, there is no hope to rebuild the character easily (is there one?) I think for some gamers a balanced type of character builds are necessary to experience a wider coverage of the game mechanics. I think this game assumes that a certain build would be required to defeat the most powerful of enemies. I think that might make sense for a medium to hard difficulty level, but not on easy.\n\nAs to game balance in certain areas of the game, Deep Caravans can definitely do a lot of balancing as I think it is too hard, even on an easy setting. The constant spawning of monsters aren't producing much fun to the game. It's making gamers frustrated as the difficulty really spikes up comparing to the previous areas. G\n\nA thing about the level-capping. Given this difficulty at the Deep Caravans, I think the level cap of 25 is not fun for the player, given that a character can get so much experience in the Deep Caravans. Once a player reaches the cap and have to fight endless enemies, the game quickly loses its incentive to progress. The player would likely to give up or lose interest in a game that becomes almost like a very hard problem to solve. Beyond a certain point, a player is likely to resort to Cheat Engine which spoils the fun. But in such a hard game like this, it may be the only reasonable option to end the *suffering*.\n\nI like it that there is so much exploratory opportunties in the game. However, the level-cap of 25, insanely hard Deep Caravans as well as Tchort does not allow player to throughly enjoy the the wide character builds and the enormous assortment of crafting items. If someone focus on a strong character build, they will lose out from crafting. Perhaps this can be solved by a much higher level cap limit and grinding, but may be against the developer's wishes.\n\nBut after so much comments, this game is fantastic, so now, go play it!","March 13","true","173.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

The important NPCs have character and make you feel like you understand their intentions. The combat system is challenging, as it should be — if you rush into a poorly planned combat situation, e.g. storm a Lunatic camp by yourself, then you're probably going to get wasted unless you had a trick up your sleeve.\n\nIt does have a few flaws. Some of them major, most of them minor. Some of the 'flaws' are really just things I don't agree with about RPGs (like Persuasion, Intimidation, or Mercantile being skills).\n\nOverall, this game is great. It seems so complicated at first, and that just makes it more fun to learn. The crafting system is extremely complex, but it is also extremely rewarding if you learn to do it well.

The area the game stands out is how simple it is, and not in a bad way. Instead of fiddling around with all kinds of keys and keypresses, the game is to the point in every aspect. I'd say it's less fiddly than even the recent wasteland. Allowing you to become immersed in the world more easily.\n\nThere are some subjective issues I have with the game - such as how everything is kind of muted. Muted colors, graphics, sounds, and world. Yet I do understand that's also the appeal. It lends to it's own unique feel. I can't help but miss the slightly more aggressively adult elements of fallout - although this game can also have just as harsh consequences.\n\nThe game has two choices for experience gain, oddity and standard. I started with oddity and then moved onto standard. Now I might start over with oddity again. I feel standard makes the game more difficult. And I'm already having a hard time of things.\n\nMore to come.

But Underrail offers a new flavor of RPG that has not been seen since the days of Troika and Black Isle.\nUnderrail an RPG with an atypical setting in which you, the player can use any number of abilities  such as sneaking, hacking, firearms, and even psychic powers such as mind control and telekinetics. But it's far from perfect. Here's a list of Pros and Cons I've found in the game thus far.\n\nPros:\n-A wide variety of skills allowing for all sorts of unique and fun builds from a stealth assasin wielding chemical darts, to a heavily armored psychic juggernaut who explodes enemies with bare hands.\n-A unique and interesting setting that feels cohesive and alien, warranting exploration.\n-Snappy turn-based combat which doesn't feel too bogged down with overcomplicated mechanics or too shallow.\n-Some quests are quite unique and well thought out, and even the "Go here kill X" quests throw in some sub-goals or mechanics to make them feel fresh,\n-A detailed crafting system allowing for custom gear to augment builds.\n\nCons:\n-Initial scenery in the first three-fifths of the game is rather dull. The scenery of an isometric game is largely one staring at the ground, so mixing up the dull gray stone floors and walls might have really helped things, but I can understand the bidgetary constraints involved.\n-Certain manditory quests become infuriatingly hard with certain skill-builds. Robots being immune to psychic powers means your psi-warrior better have a weapon skill or you're stuck sneaking. No dots in sneaking? Well then prepare to have the most painfully unpleasant gameplay experience as you re-set over and over as you try to outmaneuver or foolishly attempt to out-fight robots with weapons you didn't invest in which do as much damage as a gentle massage.\n\nNitpicks\n-Branching Dialogue using other skills would have been nice, figuring out how to fix something in-dialogue with mechanics, mind-controlling a guard to step aside and permit acess, or using biology knowledge to save a dying ally would have been nice.\n-Companions would also have been a welcome feature, especually in harder fights of six or seven bandits (One of whom is a psychic) versus your one, lone survivor. Even just having one person (Or dog, or robot, or trained rathound) on your side to engage baddies in melee or pick off berserkers with a rifle would have been handy.","January 4","true","93.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

Already the Underrail is a very big game and with each update it gets larger.  The crafting is the most satisfying crafting I've ever come across in any game.  There's nothing like finding some super high quality metal plating to put on that expensive *spoiler item* I bought over an hour ago and making the toughest armor imaginable and feeling like a total tank.  The game isn't easy, but neither is it ball-crusingly difficult.  I generally find it to hit a perfect spot in that regard but if it's too tough for you there is an easy mode.  The story (so far) is interesting enough even if the characters aren't always particularly interesting.  The combat is varied, dynamic, and requires a touch of strategy to survive.  Some find the economy to be frustrating but I find it to be quite immersive in its realism, you can't pull a Skyrim and sell a bunch of plates and goblets to a random shop keeper basically.

It has a great story, great customisation, interesting characters and rewarding combat with interesting dynamics when it comes to planting traps and sneaking about.   There are hundreds of doors and boxes to lock pick and hack, characters to meet and converse with and areas to explore, also some of the chat dialog options are awesome.\n\n\nI would however be hesitant to recommend the game to people unknown to this genre, I feel the mainstream gamer would be betrayed by the issues in the late game section when the first ¾ of the game are very entertaining.  Furthermore the black screen transitions between areas get tiresome very quick and make large connected areas like corecity feel sliced up and disjointed.\n\nUpon entering the last section of the game, it feels like a call back to a bygone era of gaming where progressing through the plot is done by only the devoted few- you would hear of how to progress from those who had stuck through it or like some Nes games, go buy Nintendo Power and discover it wasn’t so straight forward as the rest of the game was.  The last part of the game is unforgiving- not via combat as other may say(A stealthless character is not recommended!!), but with your time.  If you were unlucky such as I, you will be walking back and forth for some time (granted I did it at 2x or 3x speed with an external program, explanation below) which adds up to poor gameplay.  I was truly frustrated with the obscure late game plot quests (mainly the worm tunnel + spore jungle + powering the mutagen door, I made that journey about 8 times after selecting the wrong power) that I feel it has let the entire game down and will turn any new people to the genre away.\nIf you’re patient however, the first ¾ of the game are great, the last ¼ not so much- but I did enjoy the boss battle and final wrap up- A good solid ending to a game means a lot to me and I was pleased with this game.\n\nThanks to the devs for making this game, it’s quite a rare experience and one that I very much enjoyed.. mostly (deep carverns i'm looking at you!)\n\n\n\n*******************************************************************************\nTechnical issues and other stuff.\n\nIf you get mouse lag on full screen, I would highly recommend ‘Borderless Gaming’ a steam downloadable app which I got after almost giving up on this game… The program removed and fullscreened the games 1920*1080 window and removed the borders.. as described :D, also works with other programs, does a good job of it and is very light.\n\nAt around the 20 hour mark, I simply got fed up with travel times, it was starting to hurt my enjoyment of the game so I hunted for a program to speed up and slow down the game.  After my first play through, I have negated 20 hours, of a 100 play time by simply speeding up and slowing walking around (Not exploring new areas-just getting from A to B).\n(Calculated from steam game play time-100hours, vs borderless gaming play time 80 hours, ran them both always).\nBe prepared to walk everywhere, like I said- I cut out 20 hours of just walking.","March 1","true","122.3"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The setting is more reminiscent of the games of the "Metro" series, rather than Fallout, but with an added touch of fiction with psychic powers. Combat is turn-based and you only control your (single) character. But with the addition of psychic powers, various types of ammunition, feats and other new things, it ends up being quite varied.\n\nThe music also very reminiscent of the fist Fallout games, with its minimalist style, with sounds that blend with the environment, helping the feel of the post-apocalyptic atmosphere of the game. The visuals, well, you can see in the screenshot up there: it's great.\n\nThe game also offers a crafting system, you can (and need to) repair items, lockpicking, hacking, stealth...

Schultz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sgt-schultz/","281 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nInitial thoughts of the game:\nThe basic concept of the game feels pretty "open worldish".  That is a great thing.  I feel like I could play this game for hours at a time.  I enjoy isometric games like this or Project Zomboid.  The price was right, so hey...  Why not!?\n\n2.0 hours in the game:\nAt the main menu, I look through the options.  The game first started in a window, so I have to change that to a full screen experience.  Hmm, that’s kind of a bummer.  You are unable to edit the keyboard shortcuts or key bindings.  However, it does say "no key binding configuration yet".  Yet?  This game has been released for over a year!  You can't get something as simple as that in the game yet?!  So, I created my character, and I must admit, I like the depth of the character creation.  It is not too much, but it is not too light.  It is just right.  Before you start playing you create a character and place skill points into the areas where you think you want your character to progress.  It took me about 10 minutes to read the options and figure out where I want my character to excel, and what abilities I can sacrifice.  Once that is complete the game can start.\n\nWhat the heck does any of that text say?!  I have to squint at all of the text in order to read it.  My game resolution is 1920x1080 and yet the text is still somewhat small to read.  Wow, there is A LOT of text to read in this game.  If you have played the newer Shadowrun game, you know what I am talking about.    I almost fell asleep at my desk while reading all of this banter between characters.  You have to go through any dialog in the game using your number keys.  You are not able to use the number pad which is somewhat disappointing.  Some people find it more convenient to use the number pad rather than the number keys above the letters on their keyboards.\n\nFinally, I can play!  I am standing in what I presume is my “room”.  What now?  What do I do now?  Well, it can be difficult to see behind the walls when you are walking around.  They don’t “disappear” so to speak so you can see your character.  Can’t even use “WSAD” to move.  Have to move around the game like its DOTA by mouse clicks.  You can use the arrow keys to move your view to see what is around your character.  Everything looks somewhat small as well.  No zoom feature either.  Yes, I know, I can change my resolution size and that may help, but why can’t I zoom in on my character?  That is very frustrating.\n\nAfter I annoyingly go through the first sets of “quests” I am finally off to power some generators.  Yes, my character is a level 1 but damn!  Even the beginning enemies are tough!  I find the targeting system to be clunky as well.  I hover my mouse over an enemy to shoot it (I see the “shoot” related icon), then I click my mouse and all of a sudden I see my walking path and my character starts walking toward the enemy!  I lose the action points for that round and usually get killed anyway.  Perhaps, it would be better to make the hit boxes a bit larger so I don’t continually walk toward the enemy instead of shooting the enemy like I had planned to do.\n\nConclusion thus far:\nNot a bad game!  I can safely say that I will spend a lot of time playing it due to its gameplay and content.  The only gripes I have are minor tweaks such as text size and controls, zoom feature, cutting out the wall graphics when my character is behind a wall (so I can see my character or what loot may hide behind that wall), and still after a year there are no key bindings.","November 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 20 of 30 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","20","30","0","0"

Although the game is simplistic relative to many others being released these days, the regular pace of content releases is absolutely necessary and actually kept the players involved.\n\nMy only complaint with UnderRail is the fact that it's extremely difficult to be a well-rounded character, delving into crafting or another form of combat on top of your primary skill set.  You learn this after the first few plays.  It would be really cool to play through the game as a master of crafting/traps, letting your bag of tricks do the big kills rather than your weapons, or have a balanced Psi/melee set.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/secrkp7/recommended/250520/","secrkp7","The Secret Keeper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/secrkp7/","320 products in account","One word can describe Underrail : Tedious.\n\nWith that out of the way, I would say that the first part of this game is very enjoyable and I really thought it would become a game that I would play over and over. The quests are a reasonable introduction to the world and it's mechanics and early fights are a decent challenge. The oddity system is really fresh and encourages exploration and makes looting random places really exciting and rewarding\n\nAll of that changes after you find the drill parts and the world becomes fully explorable. For some strange reason, the writing takes a huge turn for the worse. Quest motivation is essentially non-existant beyond "This is a generically dangerous situation and you're the new guy so you have to do it." There is no world map so the exploration all of a sudden becomes incredibly overwhelming and turns into a save scum fest. The only way to continue exploring the rest of the world is to bring inventory space killing TNT charges wherever you go and hoping you didn't accidently waste one on a place you can't explore because then that would mean walking all the way back to town to get more. Walking back to town is tedious in itself because a lot of the wild-life type monsters respawn and if you don't invest in stealth, you have to fight them all over again, both ****ing ways.\n\nSpeaking of going back to town. There is a lot of backtracking and unncessary traveling in this game. The merchants only buy so much of your loot, so even if you bring a whole fresh batch of loot to town, you more likely than not still need to bring it back to whatever place you designate as storage. In addition to that, their stock is determined randomly. Despite having a great crafting system, the extra tedium in trying to find a crafting component of good quality quickly becomes frustrating. It's huge lost potential for a game that focuses so heavily on crafting.\n\nThe combat is rough. Very rough. If you again, don't invest in stealth early, prepare to save scum a lot. Many of the enemies pack stuns, immobilizes, action point reduction skills or a combination of all of them. One unfortunately timed stun usually means a quick reload. The only way to circumvent that is to always have the jump on your enemies, which you need to rely on RNG for. It's fun to get challenged, it's tedious to constantly reload a fight just becuase the game is unbalanced.\n\nEven if you slog through the entire game. You'll find the final encounter is one huge **** you. It is a backtracking hell for a puzzle that makes the boss bearable, assuming you've built your character correctly from the start of the game.\n\nUnderrail has great potential but it definitely needs a whole slew of quality of life improvements to cut back the immense amount of tedium before it can really be a great game.","April 13","false","72.7"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

If your a fan of the first two fallouts and to some extent fallout tactics you will enjoy this game. It is also a good way of getting in to said fallout games as i find the interface easyer to use an more intruative. This may thought work as a bit of a double edge sword for players of the early fallout games as it may take away some of the challenge.\nThe missions them self offer a good leave of challenge but thought some time take a few attempts to complete never fill imposable and dont make you feel like giving up completly.\nThe game has a lovily retro charm for me, and thought still in early access i have not found it to be buggy at all. look forward to seeing what upadats offer as the is clearly a lot of potental for this game.\nI highly recomend it to fans of the early fallout serious or thoses that possabley found fallout the fallout interface a little challenging and would like another way in to this style of game","March 10, 2015","true","60.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I've never played any of those game (though not for lack of trying), and I LOVE this game. There are so many different ways to play, it's insane. It almost makes me sad that I'll never be able to build all the characters I want to make. Gameplay is solid, easy to pick up if you've played any form of turn-based strategy. Quests don't hold your hand, but with the exception of one optional quest at the end (which, to be fair, is supposed to be hair-tearingly difficult), it doesn't bother me, and the world is wonderfully fleshed-out.\n\nGameplay is solid, especially crafting. I'd be hesitant to approach a playthrough that DOESN'T invest in the crafting skills, they are THAT fun to use. The only downside, for me, is that in retrospect, the characters, while not always flat, I never had a connection with any of them. There are no followers in this game, true, but that doesn't mean all the NPCs have to be that way. However, the dev team are still active, so who knows, maybe that will be invalidated?\n\nBut, flaws and all, this game is one I heartily recommend to anybody.","April 25","true","258.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

What I like especially is that unless you intentionally make a bad character, like a sledgehammer wielding hulk with no strength, it is near impossible to make an ineffective character. While some builds have some slight troubles early game, they all seem to be very effective once past the first areas.\n\nSome gripes I have with the game are:\n\n1- Respawning enemies, while not overly prevelent, do exist. This ramps up especially in the last section of the game which brings us to...\n\n2- The last section of the game. The idea is servicable, but the execution misses the mark. A lot of puzzle solving would be fun if it weren't for a lot of back tracking through areas with respawning enemies.\n\n3- Playing the game on a higher resolution does not to the font justice. The 'large' font setting is a joke, making the wonderful looking font a horrid mess.\n\n4- Transitions ahoy. The world is broken up into many small sections and loading from map to map take a while. It might just be me, but the longer you have the game open per session seems to make the loading take longer and longer to do. This could be a side effect from map transition auto-saving though, I have not tested turning it off.","January 21","true","96.1"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

At first i was like "looks ok, i'm gonna give it a try". And i was absolutely shocked about how deep and interesting it turns out. So let's look closely what make this game THAT much entertaining and unique:\n\n-First thing comes by is atmosphere and design, maybe you'll say design is not that differ compare to other indie games, but one thing is really important is how detailed locations, specially city's, railroads, hidden facilities etc. Cities looks like a citys: corruption, oligarchy, bands, mercenaries, sectants. On the other side are mindless mutants, wild creatures, freaking robots, good lord, they got everything.\n-Scenario is a great, solid work. In our times it's become really hard to find one. Everything seems logic and on the place where it should be. Great dialogs, nothing seems to be forgotten and left for lazy hand.\n-Game mechanics, different ways of tactics, yes yes, not big mouthed lie from AAA game devs, here it's true.\n-One of the most important things for me is exploring, and here you'll find it at the finest, almost endless deep caverns, underground passages, metro ways. So much options, so much things to do, can't get enough of it.\n-Craft system just right how it's needed, not so easy one and not so overwhelming with needless details.\n-Fights provide accurate level of challenging. Which is very important.\n\nFor me it feels how devs inspired by other games, but took everything they like, cutted everything that was distrubing, added some extra from themselfs, and again made one gorgeous, uniqe, solid masterpiece.\n\nOnly one thing is missing is a map, atleast that one from underrail wiki with outlines, proved to be one hell of a useful.\n\nWaiting for anythings, addons, new locations, campaigns, even new games, goodfkn luck.\n\nAnd remember, there is no such thing as hard fight, there is not enough bear traps! :D","December 22, 2015","true","101.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

To be fair it is his game, but every review I've read on it has the same gripe with issues that I have.\n\nSo let's start with my biggest gripes with this game:\n\nWhat's up with the lockpicks?\n\nThis was the first thing I remember the community rallying behind telling Styg to just "leave the lockpick system alone." It was fine, it didn't need to be changed. You had a lockpick? great you can use it as a lockpick if you have the skill. Then Styg changed it to this teired disposable lockpick thing.... needlessly complicated. You'll burn through lockpicks like your girlfriend burns through toilet paper.\n\nWait, why don't you want to buy my stuff?\n\nStyg decided to go with the "oh people only want to buy certain things" aspect of Skyrim. Yeah, that makes sense in a location with a working economy maybe, but Skyrim at least gave you a person who would buy anything, and in Fallout, pretty much anyone will take any item if it has value.\n\nLet me put it this way, you're in a desolate world, you're a trader, and some idiot has offered you an item you know you could sell for double the price. Well you obviously won't take it because you're a gun dealer, and this person is offering you gold pressed latnum.\n\nNow a lot of you reading this might be saying "Hey Hans, these are game mechanics, they're not based in reality."\nWell, in response to that I have to say it's an immersion breaker to have the game pick the most frustrating game mechanics every time.\n\nIn a nutshell, this game is overly complicated. There isn't enough flexibility to play it the way you want to. When Styg was developing the game he seemed to put more priority on making the game needlessly harder and more complicated than adding additional content. That being said the guy is a great developer. I hope he joins up with a team of individuals who have equal input on the direction of the game as he does.\n\nI'm also glad I supported this game as I believe there should be more like it out there. In it's current state, I would not recommend it to my friends because of the constant needless complication.","December 17, 2014","false","36.0"," 127 of 234 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","127","234","3","7"

Made me feel like it was 1997 and I was playing a Fallout 2 but with an easier interface and deeper combat.\n\nBest things:\n\nThe oddity XP system. There's an optional system where instead of gaining XP for usual RPG things, you instead only gain it when you find oddities. Sometimes these are found behind locked doors, sometimes in hard to reach areas, sometimes they're body parts of enemies (though these are limited). It works pretty well to reward all play styles, since the sneaky dude avoiding combat is still raking in XP by breaking into forbidden areas and looting their oddities.\n\nThe combat's really fun. I loved Fallout, but combat really just came down to "shoot everyone in the eyes". Here you probably start with one or two abilities depending on which path you go down, and the special items are big game changers. A net to immobilise a powerful melee enemy while you gun him down can completely turn the battle. A bullet in the knee cap to slow someone down, a kick to the nuts to incapacitate someone, or a psychic power to summon a ghostly enemy to harrass them. The abilities actually matter and must be used to get through battles.\n\nThe exploration element is pulled off really well. At the start of the game it feels scary to go outside to base: Attract one too many psi beetles at once and you're dead. There are also so many areas to explore at any one time, and you'll come across interesting things you might not have the skill to unlock yet or enemies that you can't quite handle yet, so it pays to draw out your own mini map. I don't know why I find this fun instead of annoying, but it seems to suit the genre to be taking paper notes for this game.\n\nThe crafting system is great fun. You'll get the best weapons and gear out of crafting if you keep your skills up, rewarding a MacGuyver character who pumped electronics, mechanics and chemistry.\n\nPlus the graphics are pretty well done, the pixel work evoking the era well. There are no voiceovers or anything (except for a few combat shouts), but eh, I didn't really miss them. I'd rather just have text than cut rate voice acting. And the ambient sound is great, from constant hisses of machinery to echoing underground corridors, it really sets the scene,\n\nThe only complaints I have are tiny, tiny things that'll hopefully be addressed as it progresses. For one it's really hard to tell if a merchant will buy a certain thing because the highlight system doesn't contrast the sellable item from all your other stuff very well. There's also some balancing to be done in the feats (too many "Timmy Cards"), because some of the early ones sound good but once you get more of a sense of the game you realise they're pretty useless. For instance, early on psi users are desperately strapped for psi points and they don't regenerate, and my sense of the economy at the time was such that I couldn't imagine ever having enough psi boosters syringes. So I spent a feat that gave me psi points every time I picked a blue mushroom. I haven't seen a blue mushroom in about 20 hours now, and I'm so rich (despite no barter skill) that I have 50+ psi boosters. Feats that save you a few bucks can't compare to some of the awesome ones that cripple your enemies, but it's hard to realise that at the start of the game so it seems like a bit of a newbie trap. There's a couple odd balance things combat wise as well--by the time decent energy weapons appear, they're mostly blocked by energy shields (which are mostly bypassed by melee weapons, and partially crossbows too). But since energy weapons is governed under the same skill as conventional firearms, it's not like you're lost out investing a bunch of points in a useless skill. Still, hope they find their niche beyond shooting unshielded wildlife!\n\nOverall there's a lot of game here already for $10. have 43 hours logged at time of writing, and this is all just one character, and the quibbles are so tiny compared to the good stuff. I Can't wait to see the final product.","September 27, 2014","true","101.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsanePsychic/recommended/250520/","InsanePsychic","InsanePsychic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsanePsychic/","417 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA role-playing game in the same vein as the classic isometric games of Black Isle, Troika and the early Bioware titles.\n\nUnderRail is still in alpha, yet a nice chunk of quests and gameplay has been implemented already, giving early buyers the opportunity to try out the game, as well as help the developers optimise and improve it.\n\nThe game takes place after an unknown apocalypse, in the old subway systems of an unnamed city. Various people band together in subway stations in order to survive the dangers of raiders and mutated creatures roaming the underground caves. The player, having just joined one such station, sets out to prove his worth to his new family, while also finding the time to complete a variety of minor jobs, much like in any other role-playing game.\n\nThe graphics are solid, without being mind-blowing. It is also obvious that some things, such as portraits for the various characters in the game has not been implemented yet. Likewise, the inventory icons could do with an overhaul in order to better differentiate the (already very large selection) of items. Even so, the graphics are nice enough all around, and for the older players, they will almost certainly inspire nostalgic thoughts of gaming in the 90's.\n\nThe music is nothing exceptional, yet it does not really grate either. The sound effects are likewise rather anonymous, yet functional, with guns popping, and hammers thumping when used in combat. Don't expect full voice-acting or anything of the sort. If reading dialogue is more of a bore than a joy, this game will not be appealing.\n\nThe gameplay itself is lifted from games such as Fallout and Arcanum almost verbatim (which is in no way a bad thing, according to this reviewer) with various stats, skills and feats, all of which can become available to the player depending on his or her focus. The combat is turn-based, with movement and action points (which are also dependant on the character's stats), protection from armor, evasion and dodging, a wide variety of weapons, as well as psychic abilities. Like many older titles, this might seem a bit confusing at first, especially to newcomers to the genre. The game does provide plenty of tool-tips and pop-ups however, and with only a bare minimum of patience, most players should be able to figure out what's up and down.\nIt also has to be mentioned that the game (in its current state) would probably be considered difficult by many. The player is initially very weak, and saving often is highly recommended. Once more, this is very much in the vein of older games, where games were often tough and unforgiving until players had gained a few levels and improved their characters a bit.\n\n\nWhile UnderRail still has a ways to go before it's done and would definitely benefit from continued updates and improvements all around, the game is already a solid offering for those who have yearned for games like those mentioned above.\n\n\n(This review was written as of the 0.1.9.1. alpha release of UnderRail)","December 2, 2013","true","6.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

But the people who gave the most helpful negative reviews did and thereby spend about 150 hours ...\n\nFirst: besides the setting Underrail has not much in common with the old Fallout series. The NPCs are forgettable, the story underwhelming and the humor almost non-existent.\nThe gameplay consists of mainly three parts:\n\n- Most of the time is to be spend on safe scumming since you are fragile and weak throughout the game. Wrong dices mean an instant reload. Not seeing the mines scattered everywhere means an instant reload. Bumping into an enemy while sneaking means an instant reload.\n- Besides this, you will spend hours with with walking around. There's no map and the quick travelling possibilites are very limited, so you have to get to the next town and back by foot.\n- The rest of the time goes into the clunky vendor system.\n\nIn total the game does not reward your specialisation but punishes you for all the skills you did not invest in. On the other hand, a "balanced" build will just fail in every regard and is no viable option either. I feel that this game is only enjoyable for hardcore gamers who seek challenges and won't get frustrated by trying over and over again. It's not like in Fallout where you where just miss stuff due to the drawbacks of your build. No, you will constantly die here, just because of everything. This is a game for min-maxer.\n\nI appreciate the work and the heart the developers put into this game, and I value some innovations regarding the mechanics (i.e. the oddity system). But all in all it's neither interesting nor fun to play, just tedious. I feel sorry for voting it down, but I really can't recommend it.","April 3","false","22.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","27"

With the emergence of Wasteland 2 a year ago I was able to experience another enjoyable open-world exploring, turn-based battle game system.\n\nUnderrail, which shares an unfortunate similar title to Undertale, has been a pleasant surprise. Here are some quick pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+Fun battle system when you figure out its many nuances\n+Much larger than you'd think\n+Difficulty is mostly balanced, especially when you know what you're doing\n\nCons:\n-Very steep learning curve for all the systems\n-Sometimes overwhelming amount of info\n-hard to navigate since there is no map (as far as I can tell)\n-enemies can ofetn be obscured by the isometric angle making it difficult to aim or accidentally walking to them instead or shooting. Kind of wished the Fallout 2 red outline was implemented for visible targets.\n\n\nTo my understanding, one guy or a very small team made this, so props to them. The game's not perfect, but it recreates that addiciting quality Fallouts 1 and 2 had, despite their simplicity. As you can see, I've already put 40 hours into this game, playing with two different builds.\n\nWhile this game tries to have the comedic timing of the other games, I didn't find the writing here to be overyly witty. There are a few funny moments, though.\n\nLastly, while the oddity system (a way of gaining EXP by doing quests and collecting oddities) is awkward at first, it's just fine. The creator also allows you to choose the classic style, where you kill to grow.\n\nI think this game is well worth the asking price, if you know you're getting into an isometric, doesn't-hold-your-hand, open-world exploring, turn-based battle game. If not, it's not a bad introduction to the genre, but it will be very difficult at first.","January 9","true","57.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are enough options in character building to make it interesting, areas are varied enough that it is interesting to explore and combat can be challenge at time. The oddity xp system is also great for those who like to sneak around  without killing everything.\n\nHowever it is far from perfect. Namely the balance is very questionable. RPG system is pretty much railroaded into (crafter/ weapon/defence) min maxing. Which if done right trivializes game.  But it also penalizes for not spreadsheeting the build beforehand - because every attribute point matters, feats are precious and there is no respecs of any kind at all. Crafting is pretty much a must if playing on hard  and if you dont engage in it games becomes much harder, while on other hand crafted items can be wildly overpowering.\n\nBut as a whole its a neat game with a lot of content and well worth the buy","April 14","true","86.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And it can suck a large amount of your time if you are not prepared and did not read a guide before hand. It might also very much be a sequence of the game that you can't finish (because 1-2 puzzles are completely delirious); it might also prove impossible to beat to certain character builds; and the possible worst part is the crazy backtracking that it will ask you if you don't help yourself with a guide of sort.\nA little spoiler before the end game  is actually a good thing, so, at some point in the game, when you believe you're near a major turning point in the ending, try to gather as much info about DC (the end game zone) as you can before jumping in.\n\n\nNow that we are past that, the game is great. And its ratio play value / price might be one of the very best out there for single player games.\nIt starts very slow, would it be gameplay-wise or writing-wise, but after 15-20 hours play time gets a lot better (fallowing the main quest), and it only gets better, and better, and better in all aspect.\nTo a certain point where you'll notice that its questlines are very linear and do not offer any alternative that the player might think off.\nAfter beating the game, you'll get those awesome sliders that will tell you how things are for the various stations that you visited, but sadly, it suffers from the same ''narrow'' writing than the quests, the author interprets your actions, instead of just stating the state of things.\n\nI personnally loved the plot, even though I think there and there are some holes, but I can objectively say that Underrail offers among the most memorable moments that video games can offer.","March 28","true","231.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

After the first Quests, the player can choose his path almost freely,  visiting a variety of lovingly crafted locations and making himself useful for a variety of factions and 'interesting' personalities in the face of first an earthquake and then an invasion. What you choose to do is decided by both morality and money, and includes fetch quests, investigations, espionage, and hit missions.\nOr become a champion in the arena.\n\nCombat is turnbased, with an action point system not unlike the one in old fallout games, Wasteland, etc;\nYou can choose between a variety of melee weapons, throwables, firearms, energy weapons, and Psionics.\nA relatively extensive crafting system can be exploited for superior equipment, including items you can't even get any other way, but you might pay for it with a skill deficiency somewhere else.\n\nThe game invokes pleasant memories of older games without being outdated or clunky, and the visuals, while simple, do well to convey the atmosphere of the world. A special mention for the music, which is certainly top notch and fits the respective scenery very well.\n\nIn total, I definitely recommend this game; there's just not many like it, and it sports good atmosphere and solid mechanics. A warning to Loot-OCD-Practioneers, however: The carry-weight limit and tendency of traders to only buy what they can actually sell might leave you rather encumbered.\n\nTl;dr:\nClassic Top Down RPG with great atmosphere. A good buy for fans of the genre, and definitely worth a look for others.","November 28, 2015","true","0.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's also pretty close to Wasteland 2 though you only control 1 character. If you liked Fallout 2, Wasteland 2, Divinity Original Sin, XCom games or Jagged Alliance 2 then you will likely enjoy this game, too. Actually, this game is better than Fallout 2 and with a bit better graphics could be Fallout 3 since it expands on almost everything and is a bigger game than Fallout 2. It's a 10/10 despite its minor flaws (and Fallout 2 and especially Fallout 1 had their flaws too, it's just the scale of these games which makes the flaws inevitable). I hope that the authors will make the fixes any time soon. As this game has the potential to become a classic.\n\nThe good:\n- a huge world to explore with a great atmosphere\n- some excellent dialog with witty social satire later in the game\n- all of the loot can be used in crafting\n- tons of occasions where lockpicking, hacking and traps are used, as well as other skills, so basically there are no useless skills or stats\n- 25+ psionic abilities offer an additional way to play thru the game (e.g. with Force Field you can create cover against ranged attackers for a turn or two, or you can even block enemies with it and escape the level)\n- the color of the cursor shows if opening a door or a container will anger NPCs around it (if they see you opening/hacking/lockpicking it)\n- already checked containers have "empty" word added to their tooltip\n- skill checks are padded in front of the dialog lines (and some other minor improvements here and the in the Fallout's model)\n- nice music\n\nThe so-so:\n- NPCs only barter for a limited set of items (like, "i'll only buy from you 3 leathers, 3 medical components, 3 weapons and nothing else"). If you are a completionist (compulsively greedy looter) like myself, you'll carry all the junk around and re-check the same NPCs over and over because the list of things they want to buy randomly updates. The weapon merchants usually have too little money to buy out your heaviest loot (endless leather armors and those stupid Sledgehammers). Still, with some patience and loot runs, soon you will be swimming in money, but there isn't much to buy. Actually, the money rewards for quests seemed laughable to me, compared to mountains of coins I already had. Btw that guy in Core City... ROFL\n- the 2D art may seem amateurish at start - I almost deleted the game before even trying the tutorial, great thing I gave it a shot). At the very first character creating screen the portraits look pretty poor, discouraging you even from starting. I'd say they may need to redraw most of the character portraits with more detail to match the rest of the graphics in the game. E.g. the environments in Junkyard and Core City are pretty nicely done. Some portraits are re-used across characters (all female doctors have the same face, all male doctors have the same face etc) - important characters should have had a unique portrait and everyone else maybe no portrait at all\n- I didn't find crafting very useful if you are playing as a pure psionic, because the only thing you need is a Psi headband (?) + rare "mentors" for new psi abilities; besides, every human drops so much loot that you are already swimming in gear\n- exp rewards are sometimes unbalanced. E.g. you get ~800EXP for killing a mob but only ~80EXP for a mob right next to it (the game seems to be using a WoW-style exp scaling system)\n\nThe bad:\n- no map of zones (see below)\n- the game's start is weak: boring dialog, no sense of urgency or even immersion, the first few quests feel too linear and pointless - a pity because starting from Junkyard it kind of lifts off and finally reaches its real, great heights approx in Core City. Also, nothing is told about where the main character came to SGS. Still, I got hooked on this game due to feeling of free exploration and freedom of where to go. On the other hand, you get lost immediately (no map!)\n- somewhat unbalanced difficulty. E.g. Junkyard quests have very hard mobs (acid-spitting dogs and mutants) which I could only defeat by running away from the level and coming from another connected zone; also borerers in GSM compound were an extreme challenge. But after you get explosives and go to Hunter's Camp, the mobs are suddenly very easy again.\n- a bug in Force Field spell: I understand that the field should expire (disappear) after the AI has done its turn and before you do your turn - but sometimes it expires in the middle of enemy turn (which made that GSM fight with borerers a torture)\n- in cramped locations it may be not easy to spot enemies behind walls -> have to press Tab for the tooltips too often. It might be a good option to toggle display of tooltips with Tab, not just showing them while Tab is pressed\n- the cave walls all look like thin 1-cell thick wall, even if it's an outer wall. This might not look like a big problem, but in fact it really gives the caves this "auto-generated" low-budget feel, especially because there are so many cave zones in the game. Maybe the wall tiles which aren't between corridors but are between a corridor and solid rock shouldn't show any thickness and instead just show black for solid rock. Also, the walls which aren't visible to the player (looking north or west) should be shown as black space. Currently caves look more like tubes hanging in black empty space\n- the GUI doesn't scale for bigger monitors. The GUI elements are all pixel-crisp but look very small on 1920x1080. Also the fonts are somewhat hard to read - simple Arial or Verdana would work better\n- frustrating end-game: exp cap at 25 lvl, I reached it before even finishing the quests in Tchort Institute, endlessly re-spawning turrets in the mushroom cave and even more endlessly respawning mobs in the Tchort caves\n\n\nAbout the map:\nFans have already made such a map of zones on the game's wiki, but 1) it's awkward to alt+tab to those maps while playing the game, 2) some maps are not accurate which adds to the confusion, 3) seeing all those zones you haven't yet seen in the game breaks the exploration feeling during the first playthru\n\nSuch a map could be shown only when you use a special "Navigator" item which also could be crafted and consumed batteries (per look at the map). Ideally the navigator should be able to calculate and show a path from the zone where you currently are to any other explored zone where you want to go, if a connection thru explored zones exists (should show rocks to be cleared, too).\n\nLess patient players can be turned off as soon as they get lost in the endless caves and sub-metro zones. It would be more logical if the zones would fit into a grid, like in JA2 - this would also make the map much easier to draw and present - as the current fans' map in the wiki stretches and bends lines to fit it all in.","December 22, 2015","true","104.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I bear much love for this game, the developers really know what they are doing and they dont care how much time it takes to finish it.\n\nThere are a lot of variables in the loot, weapons, feats, stats. crafting, it makes the game feel very detailed.\nThe level design is awesome, the music is magical (reminds me of crawling in a Diablo1 dungeon) and the whole Post-apocalypse theme is very refreshing from what we already have seen.\nThere are a lot of build paths you can take for your character, some are stronger then the other but the developers are really trying to balance everything (with succes!).\nOnly one thing that maby a bit of a downside for most players: this game is g**damn difficult! I dont mind, and the REAL hardcores shoudnt care for that either (in fact that would be a great PRO!), but if you are a fility casual, this might be a problem :P\n\nFor this money you got yourself at least a 17/10.\n\n10/10\n","February 17, 2015","true","328.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It took me a while to get into this, but I knew I was hooked when I kept thinking: 'When I replay this, the character is going to be totally different'.  If you liked Interplay's Fallout then you will really like UnderRail.  There are all the same character skills plus crossbows, more stealth, and crafting.  You can also pick PSI skills if you want spellcasting-type abilities.  I sort of wish you could make a party instead of just a solo character adventure, but this has still become one of my favourite games.\nTime to toss another molotov at the rathounds!","February 21","true","132.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a game of enormous depth in both systems and story, and boasts a generous length. That said, the end game stretch is a frustrating slog that threatens to erradicate all player confidence built up to that point, so hopefully they slim that down a bit. And remove the level cap, cause I managed to reach the cap of 25 several hours before completing the game (on classic,) and some additional levels would have actually -helped- with the ending.\n\nStill, everything up to the end game is just amazing, so definitely get this.","January 23","true","118.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The map is HUGE, and will keep you busy for 40+ hours.\n- The game mechanics are very well-balanced, allowing for a lot of different builds.\n- Innovative optional XP system that revolves around exploration and looting, rather than killing.\n- Graphics and sound are effective and fit the concept.\n\nDowns:\n- The final chapter is ridiculously complex, and about half as long as the rest of the game by itself. Just when you're ready to finish the game and move on, you're presented with an incredibly vast labyrinth filled with powerful enemies. You also have to complete a tedious scavenger hunt mission throughout the area, then fight the final boss. This sector alone has made me never want to do another playthrough.\n- While the game presents many different build options, you'll soon find that the game forces you into certain builds. Hacking, stealth, and lockpicking are borderline essential, and you better hope you have some way of piercing armor when fighting the final boss. Conversely, the speech-related skills are borderline useless.\n- You will die. A lot. Expect about one-quarter to one half of your time to be save scumming.\n- Some weird programming glitches now and then. For example, some of the sounds are on different channels, causing some sounds to go through headphones and others to go through onboard speakers. Also, the game seems to refresh its window with every area transition. Nothing game-breaking, but mildly annoying.\n- The barter system is very frustrating. Merchants will only buy a certain amount of specific items on each visit, so you'll quickly find yourself cycling the various towns just trying to offload your loot.","January 11","true","96.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It has that overwhelming level-up system that initially makes you feel like you're drowning in numbers but is extremely rewarding once you understand it. The oddity system is an interesting way to play, and i'd recommend everybody try it for your first character, it lets you really play your character the way you designed it, if you want to stealth your way across the map you wont be penalized for it. Another great thing about Underail is that you'll have to work most things out for yourself, no flashing compass indicator to follow, no big green arrow pointing the way, you'll have to explore and figure things out as you go, and pay attention to what NPC's tell you.\n\nThe combat system is standard turn-based stuff, very unforgiving and you'll need to pick your battles well. I really enjoyed Underrail and i think anybody that likes the genre will too. You really need to imagine yourself in the world to fully enjoy the game. It's an immersive experience.\n\nThe story is pretty standard stuff, maybe a little dry, but the atmosphere of the world itself is enough to keep me occupied for hours.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anybody that enjoys steam-punk sci-fi and turn-based gameplay.","May 22","true","85.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's just that good.\n\nDon't play this if you want an easy hand-holding fairy-tale with flashy graphics.\nDo play this if you're looking for games like Fallout 1/2, or maybe a little Jagged Alliance or even somewhat like single-squad X-Com... Only, this one just might be better.\n\nIt's been ages since I've seen a game with such a deep and diversified character development. Without dividing your options into classes or anything such, there's so many different ways to build your character depending on what kind of playstyle you're looking for and all of them are viable and fun to play.\n\nDespite the old-school graphics, the game manages to create an atmosphere that really sucks you into its world.\nIt's also the first game ever where crafting objects is actually something I find interesting. The crafting system is so deep and complex and yet so simple to use and very rewarding.\n\nCharacter progression is fun and well-paced and there's no annoying level-scaling. Nothing feels as good as returning to those gangers that forced you into a bribe earlier and returning later to give them some payback with your new equipment and skills. The game gives you a lot of points to put into skills but also a lot of skills to spend them on, allowing for a lot of diversity.\n\nThe storytelling is good and the many (side-)quests are very diverse instead of all the FedEx quests often seen in other RPGs. There are often different ways of accomplishing your goal, allowing you to use stealth, persuasion, look for other solutions or just go in guns blazing. Everything works and there's no wrong of doing things.\nThe world itself is large, complex and rarely forces you to follow a single path. Without a real map, quest markers or other form of hand-holding, it also makes exploration really feel like you're exploring an unfamiliar dark and dangerous underworld where danger could (and often does) lurk behind every corner.\n\nAnd then there's crafting, and the psi-powers, and the C&C, and so much else to tell...\nAnyhow, I could go on for hours, but I'd rather spend that time playing the game.","May 19, 2015","true","146.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even though I'm not too deep into it, the story feels deep and rich. I've always been drawn to the post apocalyptic, end of the world survival archtype and this game hits it out of the park. It's also a deep game as there are a lot of things to explore/lockpick/disarm/craft etc. I love when games reward you with a little money or a few bullets for finding those lonely crates and lockers hidden throughout a zone. I'm also a loot ♥♥♥♥♥ and this game is meeting my inventory managment desires.\n\nI'm about to go on a bit of a rant with problems I've run into so far. Be mindful this game is early access so I expect some hiccups. Upon full release I have faith in the devs and designers this game will be nothing short of one of my all time favorites. Okay here it goes.\n\nMake sure you safe A LOT. Enable the auto save on transitions and everything. I'm about two hours into the game on a new character and two of my save files fail to load.\n\nIt all started when I was in the Junkyard area - I went to transition from a zone where the Thugs ask you to pay 5 currency (I don't remember what its called) and they'll open a gate at the end of an alley. I didn't pay and went compass direction south and when trying to go to the next area 'failed to load transition'. Now at the main menu the two most recent saves fail to load and when I load an earlier save spot it's sucessful. Except for the part that any transition zone I try to use from the load zone I get the 'fail to load transition' error again. *EDIT* Restarting the game did in fact allow my saves to work correctly.\n\nApart from this critical problem I do have one specific concern I feel should be addressed. Then again I may be the only one who ran into this situation. I want to say this is technically a story spoiler but one of such miniscule impact I don't think anyone will be bummed if they read on. Okay enough of the babble... I feel the begining story needs to be refined (for lack of a better word) as on my first character I wasn't sure of where to go. You're sent to turn on the power of some outlying stations. What wasn't clear to me was which exit to use; the one at the barracks or the exit at the top floor. I ended up being outside the barracks dying over and over again. I kept trying different directions until I gave up. Therefore deciding it would be best just to start a new character. I realize I might not have been reading carefully enough. Having said that this is the very begining of the game. Just drop a line in the dialogue or note tab about heading to the top floor or something. If I wasn't such a big fan of the genre and video games in general I might have just given up and never played again.","May 2, 2015","true","11.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The music is great, and the ambience is fantastic, but all weapons sound very, very similar the sounds for the psi powers, no offence, sound like they were taken from a 90's DnD game.\nI understand, it's early access, but after pretty much a year and a half the next thing really does need work.\nSAVE ISSUES.\nUsually it can be fixed by closing the game and restarting it, but it's irritating, flow-breaking and it smacks the immersion over the head when you're trapped in an area because it can't load any saves, or the transition from one area to another fails.\nThe last thing I don't like is it doesn't feel as gritty as it should, in my opinion at least, and there's next to no blood or violence. I'm not one of those nutters that needs to see blood pumping out of neck stumps, but it just feels less real in a game with violence to not have any gore.\nOther than that, this game is absolutely bloody amazing, and well worth the price.","May 3, 2015","true","43.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a great soundtrack as you scour the ruins and caverns of an otherwise inhospitable world filled with rats the size of dogs, beetles with psychic abilities, your own shadow; and much worse. While at the beginning you are forced to do several introductory quests within the main storyline {mainly to progress to the open ended gameplay which takes about 40-80 minutes depending on your initial statistics}; you find yourself immersed not only in the questlines but also finding the proper crafting materials to improve your gear.\n\nYour gear does eventually break down, but can be repaired by sacrificing other gear to become scrap hunks and making repair kits or simply buying them from the plentiful traders though their stock isn't near as plentiful. Though there are many easy routes to take to most civilizations; some of the best are hidden from plain sight and must be found within the labryinth of abandoned subways and caves. You end up facing a unique selection of factions as well depending on how you interact before and after certain quests. The Faceless are a group of cybernetically enhanced secret society who hides their face under masks and hoods while mapping out the world. The CoreTech group is a protection service for the largest civilization in the game called Core City. But these are only two of the many and I mean at least two dozen plus factions you will meet, interact, and even may eventually kill off depending on your choices.\n\nBut wait, that's not all! You can fight in an arena against animals and humans to earn fans and coin; you can buy a house underground and furnish it completely for an absurd amount of said coin, you can steal dogs and cats, you can pour lava on enemies, YOU CAN EVEN CRAWL AROUND VENTILLATION SHAFTS if that's your thing. All that and more is available in this wonderful game.\n\nNow for the cons, and my probably biggest pet peeve with this game at the moment is the abusrd cost for attempting to get some end-game gear. It's up to the god and goddesses of RNG {Random Number Generator} to determine what quality you get for this otherwise adapatable material but it is expensive and literally time consuming to do so each time. But that's just the way the ball bounces.\n\nIn short, this game deserves your attention, your admiration, and quite possibly; your money. It's an astounding game that will make you continue to play it wanting more. There's even a WIKI on the main website that is being updated constantly.

Sure I had fun roaming around and shooting things in Fallout 4, but after that game its refreshing to play an RPG where stats, skills and feats (perks) make a difference again.\n\nGraphics are 2D and if you played Fallout 1/2 you have an idea of what to expect.

Or you can get what are called oddities, basically items in the game that when you loot them give you xp and a bit of story depending on what they are. Now that is not to say if you take the oddity system, that killing enemies is a waste of time. Because enemies can drop oddities as well (with a limit on how many times they give xp), plus they also drop loot, and crafting materials. And it has a fairly deep crafting system, you can craft many items, weapons, armors, weapon mods, consumables, and components in the game.\n\nStat checks are in the game although not a lot in dialogue from what I've seen so far (but they do exist). Things like perception can reveal hidden things (trap doors, etc) that let you bypass areas more easily, or agility that lets you climb over an otherwise impassable route. Nothing mind blowing but nice to see after playing Fallout 4 and missing them.\n\nIf you enjoy old school turn based CRPGs, I would give this one a whirl.\n\n\nNow time to go block more rat attacks with my face.","December 26, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I purchased this game long before it was on Steam (January 2013), and played through it and had a good time getting to the end of what content was there. I then proceeded to play through again another time with a more traditional build than my crossbow/psi build that I had started out with. I'm really glad that I did, too, because I just haven't been able to enjoy the newer versions of the game that have been released since then.\n\nWhereas most games that were short on content likely would have added a lot more content long before now, and not bothered fooling with things that were working as intended, Styg has gone around adding item durability, messing with the XP system, making merchants refuse to buy your loot and other things that frankly haven't benefitted the game in my opinion. If he had spent the time that he has spent messing with the economy adding content I imagine you would be able to get all the way to Core City by now. Instead far too many of the updates over the last year fixing things that weren't necessarily broken.\n\nStyg is devoted to his game, and the product is clearly moving in the direction he wants it to, Underrail is well worth the price of admission and a must play for any fan of the original Fallout games, or turn based tactical role playing in general. The game receives regular updates and has an interesting world to explore, I just wish I hadn't spent so much time in the game before the strange economic changes and dreaded item durability were incorporated, so that I wouldn't have known just how much more fun I would have with it had those changes not been made.","February 17, 2014","true","108.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

No map, no quest markers, minimal guidance. But I consider this an asset. It actually reminds me very strongly of Arcanum.\n\nFor me the combat is the best part of the game. It feels incredibly balanced. Although I was probably playing a strong build (pure PSI) I had to really use all tricks in my arsenal. Lay out traps, ambushes and use all sorts of mind magic (aka Telepathic PSI).\n\nThe graphics are OK, the soundtrack could use a bit more variety, but it adds to the claustrophobic feel.\n\nThe story is unfortunately pretty linear and if you side with the "wrong" people, events still play out the same, but you get punished by being told less lore. You will only know at the end of the game, which path to choose to get the most information and make the right decisions on the second playthrough. Considering one playthrough was ~100h for me, a second playthrough is not going to happen. This is a pity in the game design department, because you can very easily block out big chunks of questlines by some "roleplaying wise" / "information at the time given" sane decisions.\n\nI am recommending the game as the overall experience was very enjoyable.\n\nOnly the story related design decisions mentioned above left a sour aftertaste. If you are easily offended by this, I recommend waiting a few month until all the secrets have been revealed in the wiki and than choose your path appropriately.\n\nOtherwise, by all means, buy this game.\nThis game rocks and is how Fallout 3 / 4 should have been.

Many different useful skills, tied in with attributes and fallout/dnd style feats added in on top. Dungeons are awesome with so many different ways of completing them. Stealth gameplay is just fantastic (and optional), enemies react to sound, the amount of light and sight, and i would have to say has probably the best stealth mechanics in an isometric RPG like this.\n\nLots of gear, crafting, tons of different enemies all with different abilites as well as other human enemies who can have all the same feats and powers as your character.\n\nCombat is one of my favourite parts. Very fun to play, with all the abilities and utilites that can be used in combat, can drastically change the gameplay from character to character. You can make all wizard types who use psionic abilities and suck in combat as well as can die easily, you can make agile gunslingers who rely on wits and things like throwing nets and caltrops to control enemy movement, you can be heavy melee warriors, agile psionic monks, ninja throwing knife users and martial artists, scientist energy weapon users.\nAll the different combonations in between, and every one changes the way the combat and game is played.\n\nI recommend this to people who like games like the ones i mentioned above.

The setting is great, and the tone of the writing and characterization matches perfectly.\n\nIf you enjoy RPG games with moderately deep mechanics and itemization (e.x. Pillars of Eternity, Baldur's Gate, KOTOR etc.) and an attention to detail with large worldscapes, you will also enjoy this game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough for the amount of care put into the final product. The game is very large, with relatively few commonplace bugs, and tons of replayability through different character builds. There are also two experience systems that you can try out to suite your style of play.\n\nIf you do not like reading, you probably won't like this game. The developers really must be lauded for not even attempting voiced dialogue in this game. I'm glad they spent their resources on adding new systems, maps, quests, and art assets instead of going for voiced work that would have inevitably been subpar.\n\nThe music is good, ambient, and fits well with the tone of the game. However, it can get repetitive, as the tracks are short.\n\nLike many games of this kind, loot plays a big part. As you start, loot is relatively rare and hard to come by, but as the game world opens up, you can become filthy stinking rich if you go out of your way to explore. Still, some of the best items are found or crafted, so you may just end up spending that cash to buy components to enhance your gear. If you don't go for crafting, you can usually find good items for sale from NPC vendors, but at a high cost. Unless you skill up Mercantile :)\n\nThat being said, Mercantile is a pretty pointless skill, and you will end up having more loot to sell than vendors are willing to accept. Other skills I find to be less than useful for first time players are Throwing, and Traps.\n\nOne of the most fun aspects of UnderRail is the crafting system. I won't get into too much detail, but I would say that, for a first time player, it is worthwhile to study it a bit before deciding to go on with your first game. You may not appreciate it until you are 20 hours in and want to use it (but doing so would require starting over to rebalance skills with a new character build).\n\nThe game has two flaws, by my accounting. The first is the lack of a map system, or an interface for viewing areas you have already visited. For me, this is not such a big deal, but the oversight might make the game feel overwhelming to newcomers. The second fault is the lack of tutorials. There is a combat/basic mechanics tutorial live in the game, and a static image overlay for the UI that points out the basics, but the game lacks an in-game explanation of the crafting system. Also, the skill descriptions are not very detailed in some cases. There are relatively minor complaints, and become non-issues after playing for extended periods of time.\n\nIf you are still undecided, buy it and try it out. It is at least worth your time to try.","January 2","true","125.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you're looking for a game similar to Fallout, Metro and Wasteland, but less serious and not as expensive, this is the game for you. Even though it is still in Early Access, this game has so much content already and it has managed to impress me so far. The turn based combat can be sometimes... Annoying, but gives a unique style of fighting.\n\nThere are still some things that annoy me though: Even on your first mission, you're sent out into the open with a gun and some ammo. By YOURSELF, having teammates would be a nice addition on your first couple of missions. The second thing is that if you try to hit someone with say a Sledge Hammer, from point blank range, You sometimes miss. But I guess that's my fault because I haven't leveled my character up enough.\n\nBut for an Early Access game, It's really good and cheap for what it's worth.

Dex will make you better at lighter weapons, such as pistols or crossbows, and so on. skills determine how proficient your character is on specific field, and you want to raise it in conjunction of your attributes. lastly feats, it works exactly like perks from fallout games, where you pick "permanent status effect" that benefits you in some way. with all these 3 aspects, your characters are ready to face the perils  of underrail.\n\ncharacter builds affect your playstyle. in general, there are several different "classes". although the game doesn't really has strict classes where you lock the other when you choose one, but it is recommended to focus on one style. some of these styles can be summed as : heavy melee, light melee, heavy gun, light gun, and PSI user. of course i am using a broad definition of each style. more skilled players can make more unique build, exclusive to themselves.\n\nnot only that, the game offer simple, yet functional crafting system that deepen your experience. from new shiny weapons, to special bullets, bolts, shield emmiter, cloaking device to helmets that can amplify your awesome psychic powers.\n\nlast but not least, is the story. while not heavy on exposition and prosaic writing such recent other similar games, this game offer a unique, believable setting, filled with memorable characters and quests. As other similar games it offer multiple choices and methods to complete your objectives. you can be a one man army, or clever dude that hack and manipulate people to achieve their goals. skill checks are often used, although not as numerous as fallout new vegas, or age of decadence, it still over tremendous options and freedom.\n\n2015 is a great year for RPG, from high budget witcher 3, fallout 4, bloodborne, kickstarter goodness like pillars of eternity, or shadowrun hong kong, even "small" indie games like avernum: crystal souls and age of decadence. i am glad in the end of the year, we get game like underrail that closes 2015 with a big, big bang.","January 12","true","89.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

Like really a lot. I know I did.\n\n"Fallout-esque" is a word that gets thrown around a lot when people try to describe Underrail, and while the classic Fallout vibe is felt throughout the game, there's a huge difference between the two games. Fallout focused on dialogue, Underrail focuses on combat. Hard, brutal, save-scumming combat. And that's just fine, because the game offers you a wide variety of interesting ways to approach said combat, which helps to keep it feeling fresh throughout the game (mostly) . The dialogue is serviceable, but nowhere near the standard set by classic Black Isle/Bioware titles.\n\nThe game world is enormous, and for the most part interesting to explore, and although many of the cave areas feel a bit samey,  lacking in detail and generally "un-lived-in", the towns and cities are spot on what I'd hoped for and the highlights of your journey. The in-game graphics are fine, and what you'd expect from late 90's RPG, if a bit lacking in variation at times. The interface however... is clunky. Needlesly so. And the icons look awful and undetailed, as well as tiny if you run the game at higher resolutions. The music is amazing though, and really helps sell the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe game's non-combat mechanics can feel pretty rough at times, the crafting system in particular could do with more polish. And why there's no in-game map of some sort is beyond me, considering the size and complexity of the game world. The level cap feels really low and I reached it a lot sooner than I expected, which limited what I was able to do with the crafting system just as I was starting to take full advantage of it. I wish I'd known more about the mechanics when I started the game, I would certainly have spent my skill points more wisely had I done so.\n\nI didn't enjoy the last part of the game. Instead of culminating crescendo, it's a slow deathmarch collectathon that spams you with trash mobs over and over again. This is by far the game's biggest flaw, and probably the one that's hardest to correct.\n\nI've brought up a lot of negative points, but I've also put over 100 hours into this game, and just started another playthrough. I criticize because I care, otherwise I would've spent those hours on something else, and I wouldn't have bothered to write this review. Underrail scratches my classic RPG itch, even better than Wasteland 2 did.","March 28","true","122.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, quite a bit, actually, and so I shall.\n\nFirstly, let's start with the (very small) list of cons. The very first thing I noticed when I started this game, is that, if you aren't used to the style of combat this game uses, there is going to be a learning curve. As a matter of fact, after about an hour of play, I nearly considered giving up, because I was absolutely awful at working with the combat system. That being said, I implore anyone who picks up this game to get past the learning curve, because, as of writing this review, I have 28.3 hours logged into this game, and I am glad that I decided to press on and learn how to work with the combat system, as this game has proven to be very, very enjoyable.\n\nSecondly, and lastly, for the cons, is that this game does have quite a few grammatical, as well as spelling, errors. Many times I have found words missing a letter or two, I've seen two words clumped together several times because they are missing a space, and I've seen fragments repeated twice in the same sentence (as far as I can recall, the only instance of this was when I was talking to an NPC about a quest, I won't say which NPC due to spoilers, but the text read, "...And in these very troubling times, And in these very troubling times..."). Oh, and if a developer reads this review, I would adore the opportunity to do a completely new playthrough and make a list of all the mistakes I find so that you may correct them.\n\nNow, what you want to read if you're thinking about purchasing the game; let's talk about the pros.\n\nThis game is very quest oriented; if you aren't doing a quest, you probably aren't doing much. You can explore most areas at any time you want, but there are plenty of quests to keep you busy for quite some time, especially if you take your time to explore any given quest area. Again, I have 28.3 hours logged into this game, and I haven't completed my first playthrough.\n\nThis game is very, very versatile for character customization. You have a point system, which you can use to give your character points in certain areas every time you level up. To compliment this system, there is a bit of a nerf; you can only add so many points to a skill per level. This is obviously good, as it prevents any given character from being too powerful early in, because you can't just spam all your points to a few traits and be a beast instantly.\n\nNow, if you're a fan of character diversity, this game will most definitely satisfy your cravings. NPCs are very unique, and I have found myself drawn into talking to most NPCs to see what they say, how they act, and if they seem to fit the roll they are given in the game. Aside from that, most NPCs, if not all, come with descriptions of the character, so you aren't left with simply looking at an avatar. It's sort of like playing through a book.\n\nAll-in-all, there are so many pros to this game that I won't bother listing them all, as this review would become even more of a full-blown essay than it already is. If you're thinking about picking up this game, I would implore you to do so, because once I finish playing through with my range-based character, I plan on going through a second time with a melee character, a third time as a heavy-armor type character, and certainly a fourth time as a psionics character. I have no doubt that I'll have over 100 hours in this game eventually, and I am certain that, if you pick up this game, you will also have many hours logged into it, as well as a very, very enjoyable gaming session.\n\n*Edited so that my proposition to the developers made more sense*","December 28, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well, quite a bit, actually, and so I shall.\n\nFirstly, let's start with the (very small) list of cons. The very first thing I noticed when I started this game, is that, if you aren't used to the style of combat this game uses, there is going to be a learning curve. As a matter of fact, after about an hour of play, I nearly considered giving up, because I was absolutely awful at working with the combat system. That being said, I implore anyone who picks up this game to get past the learning curve, because, as of writing this review, I have 28.3 hours logged into this game, and I am glad that I decided to press on and learn how to work with the combat system, as this game has proven to be very, very enjoyable.\n\nSecondly, and lastly, for the cons, is that this game does have quite a few grammatical, as well as spelling, errors. Many times I have found words missing a letter or two, I've seen two words clumped together several times because they are missing a space, and I've seen fragments repeated twice in the same sentence (as far as I can recall, the only instance of this was when I was talking to an NPC about a quest, I won't say which NPC due to spoilers, but the text read, "...And in these very troubling times, And in these very troubling times..."). Oh, and if a developer reads this review, I would adore the opportunity to do a completely new playthrough and make a list of all the mistakes I find so that you may correct them.\n\nNow, what you want to read if you're thinking about purchasing the game; let's talk about the pros.\n\nThis game is very quest oriented; if you aren't doing a quest, you probably aren't doing much. You can explore most areas at any time you want, but there are plenty of quests to keep you busy for quite some time, especially if you take your time to explore any given quest area. Again, I have 28.3 hours logged into this game, and I haven't completed my first playthrough.\n\nThis game is very, very versatile for character customization. You have a point system, which you can use to give your character points in certain areas every time you level up. To compliment this system, there is a bit of a nerf; you can only add so many points to a skill per level. This is obviously good, as it prevents any given character from being too powerful early in, because you can't just spam all your points to a few traits and be a beast instantly.\n\nNow, if you're a fan of character diversity, this game will most definitely satisfy your cravings. NPCs are very unique, and I have found myself drawn into talking to most NPCs to see what they say, how they act, and if they seem to fit the roll they are given in the game. Aside from that, most NPCs, if not all, come with descriptions of the character, so you aren't left with simply looking at an avatar. It's sort of like playing through a book.\n\nAll-in-all, there are so many pros to this game that I won't bother listing them all, as this review would become even more of a full-blown essay than it already is. If you're thinking about picking up this game, I would implore you to do so, because once I finish playing through with my range-based character, I plan on going through a second time with a melee character, a third time as a heavy-armor type character, and certainly a fourth time as a psionics character. I have no doubt that I'll have over 100 hours in this game eventually, and I am certain that, if you pick up this game, you will also have many hours logged into it, as well as a very, very enjoyable gaming session.\n\n*Edited so that my proposition to the developers made more sense*","December 28, 2015","true","38.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sprawling world that feels dangerous around every corner. Wide array of skills and items. A novel 'oddity' EXP system (you level up by finding items as you explore; there is a traditional skill-and-kill based EXP system as well but play with oddities enabled, you'll love it.) A bit more accessible in terms of going new places than a lot of old CRPGs, but not enough that it's a total A-to-B fest.\n\nCons: It can be unforgiving at first, and you should either be prepared to restart more than once or research your character before building. (You won't get far without lockpicking, for example.) The crafting system is cumbersome and really for advanced players. The font can be tiny and hard to read. But otherwise this is a fantastic title.\n\nI can't recommend this highly enough if you like the old school RPGs. If you've never played an old school CRPG you may find the learning curve a little steep but if the screenshots and reviews grab you, give it a shot - you may find you love it anyway.","December 26, 2015","true","72.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like really a lot. I know I did.\n\n"Fallout-esque" is a word that gets thrown around a lot when people try to describe Underrail, and while the classic Fallout vibe is felt throughout the game, there's a huge difference between the two games. Fallout focused on dialogue, Underrail focuses on combat. Hard, brutal, save-scumming combat. And that's just fine, because the game offers you a wide variety of interesting ways to approach said combat, which helps to keep it feeling fresh throughout the game (mostly) . The dialogue is serviceable, but nowhere near the standard set by classic Black Isle/Bioware titles.\n\nThe game world is enormous, and for the most part interesting to explore, and although many of the cave areas feel a bit samey,  lacking in detail and generally "un-lived-in", the towns and cities are spot on what I'd hoped for and the highlights of your journey. The in-game graphics are fine, and what you'd expect from late 90's RPG, if a bit lacking in variation at times. The interface however... is clunky. Needlesly so. And the icons look awful and undetailed, as well as tiny if you run the game at higher resolutions. The music is amazing though, and really helps sell the game's atmosphere.\n\nThe game's non-combat mechanics can feel pretty rough at times, the crafting system in particular could do with more polish. And why there's no in-game map of some sort is beyond me, considering the size and complexity of the game world. The level cap feels really low and I reached it a lot sooner than I expected, which limited what I was able to do with the crafting system just as I was starting to take full advantage of it. I wish I'd known more about the mechanics when I started the game, I would certainly have spent my skill points more wisely had I done so.\n\nI didn't enjoy the last part of the game. Instead of culminating crescendo, it's a slow deathmarch collectathon that spams you with trash mobs over and over again. This is by far the game's biggest flaw, and probably the one that's hardest to correct.\n\nI've brought up a lot of negative points, but I've also put over 100 hours into this game, and just started another playthrough. I criticize because I care, otherwise I would've spent those hours on something else, and I wouldn't have bothered to write this review. Underrail scratches my classic RPG itch, even better than Wasteland 2 did.","March 28","true","122.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/recommended/250520/","jtgibson","jtgibson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jtgibson/","820 products in account","The game is unforgivingly difficult at times, although that is simultaneously one of its greater strengths, as it is a wonderful game of "figure it out" rather than "====---> !!! QUEST MARKER HERE !!! <---====".  It does have the same questionable lack of interaction, like such as in the third mission having two very-well armed men sitting around doing nothing while you are pitted against no less than two heavily armed robots, a half-dozen armed bandits, and over a dozen ferocious rodent hybrids, but if your character is the lone wolf type that's not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAt times I feel as though the Classic XP system is probably the way to go after wasting a literal crapton of resources killing yet another azurida with a low-leveled character, although the oddities system is certainly a fascinating design decision and it's hard to decide whether it's worth the effort (it rewards tediously clearing out every area rather than simply getting things done), but I avoided rerolling a character in favour of the concept and I'm not convinced it was a bad decision.\n\nAll shortcomings aside, this game holds me like few others do.  This is quite possibly the best CRPG made in the last ten years.  It's up against some pretty good contenders so it's hard to say that definitively -- especially as it wouldn't be fair to some of the other contenders, which I haven't gotten around to playing yet ;-) -- but egads, I can't believe I didn't jump on this the moment I found out about it half a year ago.","May 10","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe it was on sale, I can't remember.\n\nAnyway, it's now one of my all time favorite RPGs.\n\nThe easiest way to describe Underrail - an all underground Fallout2 style RPG.\nIf you haven't played Fallout2 then this review isn't for you.\nIf you don't like Fallout2 then Underrail isn't for you.\n\nUnderrail has great story telling. The text is short and efficient and the quests are somewhat diverse. It's not at the Fallout2 level of storytelling (the pinnacle of RPGs) but it rivals the other Fallout games and most other RPGs. The characters are colorful and well defined(except for the protaganist) and the overarching plots well formed and motivating.\n\nUnderrail takes a few hours to get used to.\nThe design of the world in Undrrail is self limiting because everything is underground and almost every turn is  a right angle.\nIn every fallout game, you happily open your shelter door and greet the sun. In Fallout, every dungeon crawl ends with you back on the breezy surface cruzing to base and hitting the bar. In Underrail you will NEVER see the sun. When I first started playing UnderRail I thought it might be too constrictive.\nAfter playing 5-10 hours you realize that there  is a lot of subtle  variety in the maps, and especially the feel of the different towns.  The world is well thought out and it has it's own gritty feel.\n\nAnd you can get lost in the map. The maps and the way they are connected is not made obvious. There are only a few signs and no in game maps, at least not so far. It is up to the player to piece the world together.  There are no quest markers on a minimap, unless I've missed something for 50 hours. Not having markers and maps is fine in this game because exploring stays entertaining and is somehow relaxing. And it doesn't feel constricting. The map opens up to underground lakes, rivers and a railway. Boats and trains offer quick-travel points.\n\nThe Skill tree is excellent. The balance seems almost perfect. I'm playing for my second time , on normal , (first was a rage quit). I've messed up a little bit in my allocation (I started a crafting build but didn't stick with it) so I struggled a bit but 30 hours in I'm matching up well against the mobs but still dying once in a while.\n\nI usually play these things on hard but this game's normal is actually hard. I wouldn't play this on hard. It's not DAO where if you play on normal you aren't getting the whole game. Or Fallout2, KOTOR... where there isn't a true hard option. This game is tricky the first go through. YOU CAN'T RESPEC unless you use game cheat. Lot's of enemies can  kill you in one round.\n\nWhich brings me to combat.  First, there is an immersion breaking flaw in the combat. It seems that the game often wants you to fight part of the battle, leave the combat map, recover, go back and continue the fight.\nThe way I think about this is it's like a  long assault on the enemy base but doing this over and over gets absurd at times.\nOtherwise, combat is well done. Psionics(magic) is seamless, interesting  and feels balanced. It looks like there are plenty of different builds to play.\nAnother negative is there are no companions so you will always fight solo.\n\nI didn't play a crafting build and the game seems to want you to commit a lot of skill points to make a viable crafting build. Crafting looks like it's well developed. Certainly , crafting and skills are at least as good  in Underrail as they are in the  Fallout series.\n\nThe GUI is simple and easy. Sometimes clicks don't register correctly (or the hit box is faulty) and you can ruin a long battle with one bad click but it was the same in ShadowRun HongKong(I just played before UR).\n\nThe music is low key , sad violin synth to scary violin and synth with lots of industrial ambient ... it works. Fallout 1-2 had some of the best scores in RPG so it's hard to compare.\n\nAs far as story, the biggest problem is the start. Your character has no back story. You wander through the world as a blank slate just doing the whim of others. Sure, all RPG are fetch quests for others but you usually have more reason and purpose then in Underrail. ie You are trying to recover your memory, you need to find your dad/son/wife , revenge for what they did to your clan, save your home town etc. From the very start of this game everyone is a stranger and you are immediately their main go to guy.\nOtherwise, like I wrote, the story telling is excellent and efficient. The characters are evocative, even the unknown bosses that you dispatch have personality. The world is different and makes sense. The inner politics of the various factions are actually interesting and easy to follow. I usually skip most of the background text by mid game but I read it all in Underrail because they don't bore me with long winded writing not meant for an RPG (see Skyrim, which I still loved, and many others).\n\nAlso, the game implements a novel and well done experience system(called oddities).\n\n10/10 - though it has a few flaws it's so creative with it's art design, writing  and game rules that it gets a 10.\n\nBTW - the graphics are blocky and it looks old but this isn't some chincy game for nostalgia. This is real game and you can tell the programmers were top notch and thought a lot about every piece of this game. It's going to get me 70 hours of playtime and none of that is pen and paper geekdom or nostalgia. I play most the new games: GTA2345 and I race every race , the lord of the rings game with the batman style combat , every batman, wolfenstien, farcry, rust, the one with the dinopsaurs, dyinglight on and on.  I'm not putting in these hours because It's an esoteric old school style of game. I only play games if they are fun.","June 4","true","65.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Roleplaying part is pretty redundant and irrelevant in this game. Don't get me wrong, there's plenty of great quests but the game is centered around combat, exploration and crafting.\n\nCharacter building:\nAmount of perks is enormous and you may specialize in very different and distinct builds from psi-augmented unarmed fighter to chemical gunslinger with electronic augmentations or stealth-based crossbow-wielding trapper with a freaking discharger sledgehammer. All those builds are actually viable and the game is balanced well enough. I've tried so many builds and developing new ones is the most fun part for me: you can tell that by my playtime.\n\nCrafting:\nCrafting part is very well-made: there's relatively few recipes(about 40 or so) but every recipe may use different tiers and types of ingredients that result in different items. For example with a single recipe "chemical bolt" you may make all kinds of bolts from tranquilizer to acid-infused.\n\nComparison to beta-versions:\nThe game was great even while it was in beta stage but after release it just became better in every aspect and a lot of content was added as well.\n\nMisc:\nSome parts of the game like single-use items may seem weak at first but trust me, after your 4th or 5th character you'll find out that there's actually no useless items at all, but some of them shine only if you find out how to use them properly.\n\nThings you may not like:\n- Game world is enormous in size and there's no in-game map, so you're expected to keep it all in your head which may prove quite challenging(similar to dark souls and such).\n- Vendors not only have limited cash to buy your junk, but they also accept very limited amount of items(like weapon dealers only buy 1-3 firearms) so you'll have a to stash, disassemble or just leave a lot of pretty expensive stuff because no one will want to buy it.\n- Graphics are not terribly astonishing neither technically nor artistically. Overall graphics feel a little "indie". No, they're not bad, but this game is definitely not about graphics or fancy shaders.\n- Game has some scaling issues on very high-resolution screens, namely fonts become too small. It won't be a problem on any currently standard resolution around 1920x1024 or less.\n\nVerdict:\nIf you like fallout 2-style combat and exploration, don't even think, just buy this game because it's amazing.","August 5, 2015","true","397.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Still, it's a worse game than Age of Decadence which is the best cRPG ever (only Fallout 1 can compete).\n\nThe exploration here is superb (if you think exploration in Gothic was great you should play UR, you can even blow up rubble that blocks your way and make your own passage), fights are fun and often challenging forcing you to use your brain instead of mindlessly clicking on an enemy, crafting is quite complex and well developed, character creation is well designed and allows for different builds and different playthroughs (not as good in AoD though). The plot and dialogues are decent and even though most quests are fetch/kill quests there are many very interesting ones so that the player wouldn't get bored.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws of course. My main gripe with this game is that you can't run here and travelling is so slow. Due to this about half of your gameplay time will be spent on walking from point A to B. It's not as bad as in Bethesda games though where locations are bloated so that the world would seem bigger. In UR there is also a form of fast travel so after first few missions it gets much better. The other thing that annoys me is that font is too small. There are some more minor annoyances but all in all pros outweigh the cons in overwhelming proportions. Because of these cons however, I consider Age of Decadence a way better game despite the fact that Underrail is one of the best games I've played in 10 years or so. But UR is cheaper and it has as good value for money as AoD.\n\ntl;dr\nThis game is worth way more than it's being sold for and instead of wasting time on reading reviews just play the demo and see for yourself (same goes for Age of Decadence),","December 31, 2015","true","168.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

This is not Fallout so if you’re gonna buy it, don’t ♥♥♥♥ing expect Fallout. I actually bought this because it looked like the best game series on Steam (Shadowrun) and thus my wallet instantly made room. Short story short, the game is an isometric retro style RPG thing made in an outdated game engine that occasionally rapes my CPU because the devs accidentally forgot to remove like 30 memory leaks or something. Oh wait, I forgot to briefly give my opinion nonchalantly then acknowledge the action. It’s pretty good, and I’d be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if it wasn’t because $15 in the Steam indie scene is ♥♥♥♥in Bill Gates tier ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWhat is ♥♥♥♥?Well, after I dropped more money than I should have on the Steam Winter sale, I played this for about four hours then left it for a month to go back to playing random ♥♥♥♥ indie games. Reason: It’s too ♥♥♥♥in hard. Maybe I have a bad case of “mad cuz bad,” but the beginning of the game’s difficulty curve hits you like a freight train. You get in the game and it’s all like “let’s re-go over the training in a System Shock 2-esque way.” k. Training completed. “Now go talk to Bob Dylan on the fourth floor of the Shangri La in the room down the hall.” Hold the ♥♥♥♥ on game. How the hell am I supposed to figure out where this prick is if I’ve never seen this place before.\n\nProblem 1: Make a god damned map you lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥“Exploration!” “Fun!” “Kill me!” “♥♥♥♥ this! I’m out!” This game is no route 66 okay, I couldn’t find anything the game was telling me to. (I would have a hard time finding ♥♥♥♥ in a johnny on the spot, so that’s partially my fault.) At one point early on, it tells me that I need to go activate 3 generators to the south or some direction. k. Mind telling me how to ♥♥♥♥ing get there? Maybe a place name? Maybe a ♥♥♥♥ing map you lazy pieces of ♥♥♥♥? “Nah fam,” the game says. My favorite time being the equivalent of an American tourist asking for directions in the Middle East was when the game said in the notes “Find Kurt Kobain and do whatever the ♥♥♥♥ he says, then tell me when you’re done.” k. Where is Kurt? Well, apparently it said in the dialog; but I was rather irritable at that point so I skipped the dialog in favor of just checking my notes. But sadly that ended in about 30 minutes of frantically searching some user made map and the cancerous forums. Fun, eh?\n\nProblem 2: Too ♥♥♥♥en hardGo release your inner 12 year old on CoD you ♥♥♥♥ing tool, I saw your “that’s what she said” coming from a mile away. At one point Mr. Reed told me to go catch x amount of rats the size of poodles in some caves. K. I’ll skip the ♥♥♥♥♥ing about finding the caves since we’ve already established that this game could be improved with a Rick Steves DVD box set of the caves. So I go down there a -- wait, I forgot, the son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ Reed also said to find the other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ he sent down there to do the very job I’m doing right now. Well now I don’t feel as confident in myself and I think Reed is feeling a little overconfident in me or just thinks I’m expendable as hell. So I catch the running meals, then take three steps forward to find some giant ♥♥♥ beetles that have all been trained by Severus himself. So now I have half the insect equivalent of the Slytherin house chasing my dumb ♥♥♥ as a shoot my 100fps bb gun at them. “♥♥♥♥ it, I’m out.” I hope I can go back to Reed and say “didn’t see him.” Nope. So long story short, I used about $300 worth of supplies to get this guy. (And 20 minutes on the, ♥♥♥♥ it, won’t even speak of the maps.)\n\nProblem 3: MoneyWhere do I get this ♥♥♥♥? Well, scavenging of course. After like 3 hours of playing I was carrying more than a pickup can handle in presumably my shoes, so I decided to maybe slip a little above the poverty line by selling everything I own the slowly crawl back below that to get some god damned med ♥♥♥♥. So now that I have nothing but half a tattered chestplate, 5mm (Not kidding, that is only 0.5mm above a bb gun so my analogy wasn’t at all ridiculous.) pistol, some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ knock off Gerber knife, and more med equipment than under doomsday prepper’s bed. Oh ya, and just enough money to get me and all my homeboys a large Slurpee on the house, and just maybe a pack of Popeye’s on the side. This wouldn’t be a problem if I’d get some god damned money for my work. ♥♥♥♥ it, I’m done complaining about money as well.\n\nThe good stuffI’ll keep it short since it’s hard to be cynical about stuff you like. Anyway, the game does have the retro feel, it does it quite well. The sound direction and graphics are pretty decent too. It has Everything you want from an RPG, somewhere in between Neo Scavenger and System Shock 2 levels of it (Definitely leaning towards SS2.). Controls are good, they don’t ♥♥♥♥ up, and best of all, once you decide you are the ♥♥♥♥, you can shoot up the place and take over. I’m kind of used to Shadowrun at this point, where I was good enough to decide who lives and who dies and take what I want, but I forgot about that here, tried my hand at the armory, and learned that my bb gun doesn’t dish out lead quite the same way as there ARs. Aside from my general ignorance, the AI is pretty good too. And you can be CHEEKY BREEKYS AND PICKPOCKET. 10/10\n\nVerdict“This guy only has x hours, this is an RPG!” Don’t care for my opinion, the ♥♥♥♥en leave. It’s good, and I think my $15 was justified, and I don’t say that about just any game.","February 7","true","13.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sciencewhore/recommended/250520/","sciencewhore","SeniorMic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sciencewhore/","40 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI have been searching for a original Fallout type game for so long, and when I say FO game I mean: isometric+RPG+openworld+REAL turn-based-combat(not that pause command BS with the space bar). Problem is, you can never really get all those elements together in a new game anymore. You might get 3 out of 4 if your lucky. Sure theres a few games that kinda play that way but really don't pull it together like the first 2 Fallout's did.\n\n\nSo after buying the game and putting in 10 hours of solid gameplay I think I've reached a point where I've had enough for now. But before all the fanboys get their panties in a twist just understand that I totally get that this guy put a hell of a lot of work into this game and it shows so I'm not here to sh~t on the product. Yes it is a unfinished title, but I highly doubt anything of my own concerns will be addresed at this stage. It is what it is now, and my constructive criticism is exactly that. Of course this review isn't for the fanboys. Its a honest opinion for people like me who want a game with similar mechanics and X-factor similarly to the original fallout experience.\n\n(deep breath)........OK, here we go\n\n\nThere are two main critical issues with the game.\n\nThe game becomes exponentially difficult very fast. This would be ok if you had multiple ways of getting around baddies but this simply isn't the case. I reached level 5 and put a lot of points into guns as well as perks that enhance gunplay. Didn't have much impact as everything killed you and had like a million more action points than you. To make things worse, aim accuracy would drop from 90+ to 19% at point blank range at any given time for no reason. The only time FO did this was when you had moved into a darker spot, and you would have to lure a critter closer to a light source for better shots. I checked all possible reasons why this might happen and could find nothing wrong with my guy or weapons.\n\nI love that Guns and ammo are hard to get and that they have a "quality/condition" stat that goes down making your stuff less effective as you play. This requires buying mechanical fix kits to keep that stuff going, but in order to buy a "kit" you need the right amount of coin. Chances are your not going to have that much coin so you need to barter with some of your inventory items. Thing is you can't just trade with what you got. Each vendor has a list of certain items that they will ONLY take. If you don't have said items then you need the right amount of coin to compensate. I really liked this system at first. It made you think about what you needed to collect in order to get what you wanted from any given dude. Then you could trade said item to a different dude with a different list of items he/she needs and so on. Seemed like a cool workable system. Problem is.....well, there are actually many problems here, but ultimately it leads to the second major issue with the game....Inventory/items.\n\nIf you can't buy what you want and you can't barter for it then you have to make the item yourself using the many crafting skills. Of course you will also need to put stat points into each of those skills. As always this is fine and dandy for those who enjoy crafting but I personally prefer to FIND stuff rather than have to make it. This game does not give you the choice. As the game progresses you have less barter potential. Vendors don't need what you have and if they DO chances are very likely that they don't have what YOU want. Even if you try to embrace the crafting aspect(which you will) it becomes so overwhelmingly monotonous and boring that you may want to punch your computer right in the face. Virtually all items in the game are built around a recycling pyramid structure wherby each item needs various parts to be made. You get those parts by breaking down other parts or killing things. On the other hand If you don't have one of the many types of kits to fix one of the many types of items then you can break it down into scrap. Its a workable system yes, but there are SO MANY items that require so many differen't components I just can't keep track. At a certain point you will require beer. LOTS of beer.\n\nThe limitation, implementation, and tedium of the inventory panel makes the whole mess even worse. Each item and component takes up one miniature square of space in the inventory and is efing tiny to look at on screen. Like MICROSCOPIC!\nNow if that was the intended desire ok. There is a crapload of "stuff" you will need to hoard so fine, we need the real estate. Just let me be able to separate and move my stuff around so I can keep track of it. WHAT!!! no no no no no, are you SERIOUS? Your telling me I can't move my items around and keep them there like every single other game in existence??? Dude, what were you thinking?\n\nThis is what you get folks: a sort button, and category tabs(which you will HAVE to use). The sort button is totally usless, everything is super tiny, and you have to stare a hole into your screen just to see whats what. If you try to move an item to say the bottom of the panel it will auto snap back up with the rest. This is completely unacceptible given the sheer amount of stuff and the way you have to play the game.\n\nI could go on about some of the minor things but its probably redundant at this point.\n\n\nMy verdict here is buy the game if you love crafting, have the patience of a Turtle, have the eye's of an Owl, and have the memory of a Elephant.\n\nFor everybody else, well.....even if all the issues were fixed and changed this still wouldn't be the Fallout type experience you wanted. That said, it still would be a great game. If the inventory was better then the game would atleist be tolerable play wise. Unfortunately I cannot recommend the game as is.","November 21, 2014","false","30.1"," 117 of 232 people (50%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","50","117","232","13","8"

In comparison, I find recent Bethesda RPG games like Fallout 4 difficulty to be bland and the game mechanics to be oversimplified.\n\nHaving read some steam reviews I went in with these expectations, which was important: 1) The game starts out with a high difficulty. There is not much hand holding. 2) There is no map and no quest markers, so you have to take mission notes like directions out of game.\n\nBuilding a character, I felt a bit shoehorned into some specific bulids because of how the synergies work, but overall Ive been very pleasently suprised by how fun the character building and leveling is.\n\nThis is an RPG carrying the torch of fallout 1 and 2, while innovating and being completely its own thing.

Like using your noggin to figure out how to solve problems? Well I'd say UnderRail is a good fit for you. A post apocolyptic world that takes place in the Old World's underground train system. "Oh gee whizz" you might say "Isn't that like Metro 2033/Last Light?" to which I say "Yeah." but is that a bad thing? That's a pretty neato set up but now you get to actually interact with the world and not just POW POW BOOM RATATATATATATATA *guys dying*. Not that there's anything wrong with that but with a setting like this I always just wished you could really explore the world and really dive into the lore and not just See last sentence.\n\nAnyway the game is very much like the original Fallout games in that it's a top down isometric RPG with Attibutes, Skills, and Feats (Perks, whatever you fancy). Play as the roided out killing machine you've always wanted be, the stealth (gamer) assassin that strikes from the shadows, the diplomat that tries to reason and bargain, whatever you want to play you can do it. I mean you can't be a griaffe or anything but hey maybe a future update can let you live out you post apocolyptic giraffe fantasies. It's a pretty good challenge on normal. You certainly can not jump in guns blazing hoping to win. The early game rathounds can really pack your fudge if you don't deal with them strategically.\n\nA pretty interesting feature is the choice of how you level up. You can go the usual way of kills equals experience or you can go the way of Oddities. Oddities are little items you can find on dead enemies or in containers that give you XP in chunks. I went the Oddities route and so far it's pretty neat. Reminds me slightly of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with it's little glowing item thingies.

Like using your noggin to figure out how to solve problems? Well I'd say UnderRail is a good fit for you. A post apocolyptic world that takes place in the Old World's underground train system. "Oh gee whizz" you might say "Isn't that like Metro 2033/Last Light?" to which I say "Yeah." but is that a bad thing? That's a pretty neato set up but now you get to actually interact with the world and not just POW POW BOOM RATATATATATATATA *guys dying*. Not that there's anything wrong with that but with a setting like this I always just wished you could really explore the world and really dive into the lore and not just See last sentence.\n\nAnyway the game is very much like the original Fallout games in that it's a top down isometric RPG with Attibutes, Skills, and Feats (Perks, whatever you fancy). Play as the roided out killing machine you've always wanted be, the stealth (gamer) assassin that strikes from the shadows, the diplomat that tries to reason and bargain, whatever you want to play you can do it. I mean you can't be a griaffe or anything but hey maybe a future update can let you live out you post apocolyptic giraffe fantasies. It's a pretty good challenge on normal. You certainly can not jump in guns blazing hoping to win. The early game rathounds can really pack your fudge if you don't deal with them strategically.\n\nA pretty interesting feature is the choice of how you level up. You can go the usual way of kills equals experience or you can go the way of Oddities. Oddities are little items you can find on dead enemies or in containers that give you XP in chunks. I went the Oddities route and so far it's pretty neat. Reminds me slightly of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with it's little glowing item thingies. Maybe I'll end up hating it later but so far I think it's a neat way to really incentivise exploring the environment as creatures will not always drop an Oddity.\n\nWhile I have not completed the game I must say after 3 hours I'm hooked.

I've been following Underrail since it was first announced. I really wanted to like this game.\n\nNow, I'm willing to admit that I may not have given the game enough time to grow on me, but that's the unfortunate reality behind the ~2 hour return policy - it kind of forces some early decision making. But during that time, the game failed to impress me on any of its major systems: the UI & controls, stealth, dialog, combat.\n\nStarting with the UI and controls, I'm disappointed any time a new release has a camera pan feature that doesn't use WASD. Clicking everything was a minor annoyance, so I won't spend any more time on it. But the UI is horribly small, and the "large" options are still pretty small. The icons are so small that I found myself not even using them. Trade menus are unusable without the filtering options, and those are slow and laborious to use.\n\nStealth was immediately frustrating, brought about by the combination of needing to click to move my character and the camera and not being able to pause the game. If you could pause the game - no problem. If you couldn't pause the game but you could move your character AND your camera at the same time - no problem. But making stealth where you can't look around corners, can't pause, and have to move the character and the camera with the same mouse? No thanks.\n\nThe dialog was... bad. If that's too harsh, then it was a missed opportunity. The beginning of the game is slow, and that can be okay if the activities you're engaging in are... engaging. But the dialog is bland. I felt like the game wanted me to listen to a bunch of talking without giving me any reason to be invested in anything that's being said. Just to be clear, this early game talking wasn't exposition or stage-setting - it was essentially all flavor text. That's a HUGE liberty to take at the very beginning of the game when the game needs to be hooking me with compelling reasons to give it my time and attention.\n\nFor me, this is no different than the pilot of a TV show that uses its precious first episode to not setup the plot, setting, and main characters, but to bore viewers with throwaway dialog that doesn't relate to anything meaningful or interesting. It's a wasted opportunity and a waste of my time.\n\nFinally, the combat was nothing but functional. It is no longer acceptable for me for games to do "as well as" the old titles they're modeled from. I want advancements and improvements that engage me presently, and I didn't find that in my short time with Underrail.\n\nAgain, it's possible I didn't give Underrail enough time to woo me, but its failure to do so in its critical introductions is itself one of the game's shortcomings. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect modern games to make an attempt at attracting me, particularly early on.\n\nLastly, I want to mention the pacing of the game. Namely, there isn't any. As soon as you leave your room, you are free to "explore" every level (all 9 of them... I think it's 9) of your starting station. I love exploring, but I need to care about the world, its denizens, and my place in it BEFORE it's of any interest. This is the identical issue I have with the dialog. Why do I want to talk to random stranger #6 when I haven't been given any frame of reference in the world? Why do I want to go exploring in a game that I don't even know if I like yet? I need Underrail to date me for a while before opening its doors and inviting me to come move in with it. But Underrail makes no attempt to set a scene and place the player in it, at least not at the beginning when it really counts.\n\nOn this last point, I feel it's also worth mentioning that I've seen people talk about an opening cutscene that talks about the state of current affairs, but I got not such cutscene when I started my new game.","December 20, 2015","false","2.3"," 74 of 150 people (49%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","49","74","150","2","17"

The problem is, the world in this game is devoid of any substance and feels very cookie cutter. The worst problem is it is horribly unbalanced. The combat is WAY too difficult when you are first starting out. I do not mind a game being difficult, but with this game you will just keep getting killed during any encounter with an enemy. If you enjoy relaoading multiple times in each combat situation, this is the game for you. For me, this just shows the games creator's lack of any understanding game balance.

I had to play it, and overall despite some boredom moments/parts I had a very fun ride until the final parts where suddenly the game increase the design flaws to some paroxysm:\n- Heavy very fast respawning, up to a point to make combats totally pointless. (bad use of respawning in the whole game but becoming awful in last parts)\n- Go explore everything and check every single container to ensure you don't miss the major item. (general bad design of hints during the whole game but pushed to extreme in final parts)\n- Heavy reloading generated by sneaking because of the random involved. (a general weird design of the game with a gameplay design where reload often is the base of many design either because of the random involved like initiative random with an influence that can be huge,either through tricky context you have no way to anticipate just discover load back prepare to it come back, more)\n- Excessive inventory and depot management up to boredom (in general a tedious aspect of the game, but in last parts a total boredom because the game trap you in a set of areas and the heavy respawning make any depot and inventory management a total boredom but quite a necessity until you know every single element of those final parts)\n\nIt's still an amazing game despite some weird design bases and some boring parts/elements, and no way I would want not have play it.

For example, early on I ended up locking myself into a security room and turning on autoturrets and watching through security cameras as several raiders fell to it's hail of bullets. After walking out and realizing I hadn't managed to make the turrets not target me, I quickly rectified that situation before looting everyone's bodies and waltzing out.\n\nIt lives and breathes other post-apocalyptic games (Fallout 1+2, Metro, also I get a really strong Arcanum vibe from it, but that might be just me), but embraces them in ways that work well and while obviously inspired, feels like homage and as a jumping point for it's own story. That story is well crafted, with interesting characters and quests/missions that feel like logical extensions of the world.\n\nFinding your way through the well-designed maps (protip - go for high detection it'll save your life and make it so much easier) is a blast, and feels very polished. I haven't had this much fun exploring ventilation shafts since Deus Ex. Looting is fun, with lots of stuff to get and make and sell. Combat is turn-based, and very tactical. You end up wanting to plan your fights very well, and each new enemy brings it's own set of tactics to respond to.\n\nIt's early access, and I still haven't finished what's present. When it's all there, this game is going to be even more fantastic, and a must buy for anyone who loves these isometric RPGs.

One of the best feature of this game is how much freedom you have, you can do anything at any time without being restricted to certain paths.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Logfeller/recommended/250520/","Logfeller","Logfeller","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Logfeller/","602 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA modern day isometric turn-based RPG that is almost an instant classic. If you lived in the era of isometric role playing games such as Fallout, you will quickly fall in love with UnderRail. It is charming because even though it maintains a retro style with artwork and gameplay elements, it also feels intuitive and innovative in it's own right.\n\n- The "oddity" xp system in this game suits it perfectly. Players must find items called "Oddities" to gain experience and level up instead of grinding through enemies and objectives to gain xp, players are forced to explore in the manner which suits them most in order to gain xp. Whether you engage combat head on with every opponent or avoid them with stealth or manipulate your way into places with persuasion, you will be equally rewarded with xp. This means players are rarerly forced into combat and a diplomatic or pure stealth playstyle is not only plausible, but enjoyable.\n\n- The crafting mechanics are finely tuned and well-balanced as of the recent patch. The crafting system makes sense and the skills are very rewarding to invest in but are not a necessity by any means. The player can go through the game crafting his own gear, stealing it, looting it or buying it. Crafting will eventually lead to higher quality gear though which makes it feel like a worthwile skill investment.\n\n- The skills in general are all well balanced. There are a few nuances, such as unarmed combat and the evasion skills being underpowered compared to using melee weapons and wearing heavy armor, but still are definately viable if you don't mind the extra difficulty.\n\n-The psionic abilities and skills in this game are great. It provides variety in combat along with the various traps, throwables, consumables and ammunition types to make combat feel layered and strategic.\n\n- The depth in dialogue is lacking and the plot does not feel fleshed out yet or immersive. Mind you this game is still an alpha and the content is currently being worked on for the next big patch. It will provide much more dialogue and lore and add many new areas to the game to explore and immerse in. The game right now can be finished in 15 hours if you are playing at a fast pace. However there are many side quests and distractions to keep the playtime around 30 hours.\n\n","January 25, 2014","true","332.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But has many things added to it such as crafting, soon, energy shields, nice map for being an early release game. There are also a group of skills and abilities using a thing called psi which basically is mana for a futuristic game. There are many special abilities you can use and this adds a lot to the game. The weapon skills now consist of crossbows, guns, melee, and thrown weapons which is a great variety with this game coupled with the psi abilities- which are also combat skills. Crafting is really well done in this game the tradeskills you can choose from are Electronics, Mechanics, Tailoring, Biology, and chemistry, which have a wide variety of recipes and you dont always get he same item with the same stats, which makes you not have to grind through these skills. Overall i would definitly recommend this game but remember it is an early release game so it will be much bigger than it is now and have more items. Also they update the game around every month since the updates are generally very big, adding a new town or a bunch of items, or features.\n10/10 overall for me( this is my opinion) since i love this style of game and love post apocolypse stuff in general. Send me a message through steam if you have any questions about this game or any of the old isometric view games since i played them since I was a young kid.","March 21, 2014","true","220.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I did not play it or even install it until very recently, and boy oh boy do I regret putting it off.\n\nTo preface, I am a big fan of Fallout 1 and 2, and UnderRail, in my initial 5 hours of playing it, give me the exact same feeling of wonder and interest that I had with the aforementioned Fallout games. The game plays a little differently in some ways, but early Fallout players will feel quite at home.\n\nAfter experiencing both the Oddity and Classic EXP systems I've discovered that the Oddity system makes stealth, pacifist, stealy-thiefy, and other unique playstyles totally viable, as you gain exp by doing quests and finding items called oddities around the environment, on corpses, and by pickpocketing as opposed to killing everything and using skills.\n\nThere is also psychic powers, which largely do not interest me (yet), but it's yet another playstyle option available.\n\nTL;DR, if you liked the early Fallout games and want something familiar yet unique, definitely give this one a try.","June 5","true","13.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Oh, those glory days back in 1994 with Jagged Alliance.  Oh the wait for JA2.  Oh the disappointment of the subsequent JA licensed titles.\n\nBut Underrail, I dunno.  I'm not going to play any more after being unable to compelte the first mission.  From some searches online as I encounter problem after problem with basic things, it seems if you don't happen to pick a perfect set of opening stats and perks you just get stuck.\n\nThe rathounds?  _So_ hard.  I have never seen a game with an initial enemy so hard to kill.  It'd be fine if you could, you know, use cover, or otherwise exploit the landscape to outsmart them.  But nope!  They can run further than you, and then they always have enough AP to attack you three times.  They almost always hit you.  They get critical hits that are in the range of 20% of your health.  They swarm in packs up to _four_ and they get _multipliers_ for more than one attacking you at once.  And all you have is your trusty piece of garbage pistol that takes at least 2 of your turns to kill them.  So it just becomes a game of hoping you can make only one find you at once, because if two or three get you, you're dead, or so close to dead you're using your precious stimpacks to heal.  (No, you can't use the other type of healing available to you, bandages, because you're less than 40% health and they don't work in that case.)  You have to spend every once of AP on firing your peashooter at the weakest one, hope you kill one every 2 (but probably 3 or 4) turns, while sweating out the attacks from his three buddies all chomping on your with increased "Pack Hunting" damage.  You can't move because they swarmed you in one turn and you are now surrounded on all sides.\n\nLucky me, I found a machine gun.  It does . . . no more damage than the pistol.  In burst mode, it does actually have a chance to kill them in one turn, but it probably doesn't.  But it doesn't matter because I could afford 11, yup, 11 bullets for it.  And I had all kinds of junk, but I couldn't trade for it.  (The barter/trading system is too hard to actually use because you are always "trading" instead of, you know, using the invention of CURRENCY.  Even credits are an item you must "split" in the inventory and trade for other things.  And some vendors don't seem to buy some stuff, or at least I think that's what the faint pink X through an item means on the barter screen.  So tedious.)\n\nSo, is it fun?  Not one tiny bit.

Lockpicking: click lockpick, click door. Hacking: click hacking tool, click thing that needs to be hacked. Sneaking seemed awkward as well. You need to hide behind walls to avoid camera angles, but because you're behind the wall you need to put yourself in the open to see where the camera is looking.\nAlso during combat, if you didn't read those clunky paragraphs of text, you need to know that space ends your turn, and enter ends combat mode (under conditions like: all enemies are neutralized, or you have avoided line of sight long enough to escape.) It doesn't really prompt you the way some games do (think Civ V; a large button glows saying "END TURN" once you've taken all possible actions.) So even though I did read the text it felt awkward at the end of turns because it didn't feel right. Hard to explain, maybe it's just me there. But at the end of battles: all enemies are neutralized but you're still in combat mode. I feel it should just end; or even just use the same button (spacebar, instead of enter.)\n\nI couldn't let this dry gameplay go, because dialog is also dry. Explanations of the above processes (click gun, click target) took entire paragraphs, sometimes several. The writers for this game need more experience. Mostly, it just wasn't gripping for me, in the way a game like Undertale, or Tales from the Borderlands (even just the Borderlands series in general). The writing lacked humor; they had a few jokes that were okay (in tutorial you ask: How do I hold this gun? Guy answers: Good one. *then a huge awkward paragraph that was hard to read.)*\n\nI would not recommend this game: gameplay was weak, writing was also weak. Character creation was fun though; I got to imagine all the cool things I would be doing. Except it's all click this click that, without cool animations to make it feel satisfying.","April 12","false","0.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's actually amazing that it's all done by one incredibly talented man, and still in early access!! It's mind-blowing the content that has been added to this game since even before Steam, and now that it's on Steam, everything has gone fast forward! I wish Styg the absolute best in both this game and any future endeavours!!\n\nNow HONESTLY everyone, if you love a good, deep, engrossing story, with an endless amount of ways to go about progressing through it, not to mention the incredible new experience system, that, without going into too much detail, gives the game an even better flow, and in my opinion only makes the experience gain better, and fairer, all combined with a dark, gritty, HUGE and still growing environment the likes of Fallout/Metro2033 and something of it's own with ghouls, ghosts, mutants and ROUS galore!!

Underrail honestly has every right to be up there with other 'high-rate' games like 'Skyrim' but, sadly, money speaks to people more than story, but seriously, GIVE THIS GAME A CHANCE!! you will NEVER regret it!!!\n\nPS: Used incredible patience and timing to avoid highly accurate and deadly robots, shot my way through two raiders before another turned up with a sledgehammer behind me, knocking me out.. He pummled me senseless until I woke up again, at which point I sprayed him with my SMG.. finally, he fell at my feet..

The graphics are clean and simple. The game definitely is shooting for the depth and strategy of turn-based RPGs of old that we all know and love (Fallout 1 & 2 namely).\n\nI think this guy has done a remarkable job of doing just that, all while weaving in a better crafting system to boot.  There was a solid 3-10 hours of gameplay when I first purchased and did a playthough in early 2013, likely much more now.  Stygian software has been cosistently adding features, areas of the map, etc over the last 18 months since I've been following it. I'm waiting for the game to complete before diving in again but it's tempting to start another character.\n\nIf that sounds like something that would be worth chipping $10 towards then do it, you are letting Stygian complete a work of love that I'm sure will put them on the map.","July 23, 2014","true","53.2"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

I'm not.  The game is fundamentally flawed and isn't very fun to play.  Basically the game devolves into save-spamming and retrying things until you find the one exact right combination of actions that can get you to move forward.\n\nClearly, the sole author of this game had a design 'philosophy' of "I haven't created a situation that requires this particular skill to be maxed so I need to do that now."  Basically you wind up restarting the game from scratch 5 or 6 times creating a character that meets that exact situation, only to discover that you didn't spend all of your points on another skill required to advance so you restart and try again and get bored of repeating the same starter content over and over over...\n\nCombat is absolutely rediculous.  Never mind the "I am stuck moving 5 tiles at a time because I made the mistake of getting into combat once in this room with a creature that had no xp value and doesn't even appear to be present anymore" aspect.  The unbalanced nature of combat (think 5 vs 1, they have machine guns you have a butter knife) is pervasive even in 'easy' mode.  Some scenarios are just flat-out unwinnable even if you currently restarting the game with a 'pure combat' character design.\n\nThe crafting system is absurd.  You can make neat stuff--but never be able to use it because you spent all of your skill points being able to make neat stuff.  Hey, great I just made a machine gun that will miss 99% of the time.  What's the point of that?\n\nAny of the above would be no problem for almost all RPGs.  Can't do an area?  No problem, find another area and level up or go grind for XP.  Sorry, you can't do that in this.  Area progression seems really, really linear and you can go from "OK I have the exact right set of skills to win combat here" to "I just got ambushed by things I couldn't even hit once"  just by crossing a single screen.  The only creatures that seem to respawn are useless 'critter' type things that yield minimal XP.  I'm sure it will be lots of fun waiting for 87 rats to spawn to make it from level 7 to 8.\n\nEven you were insane enough to want to grind out XP in this way it's ultimately self-defeating.  Every combat action either expends ammo or durability.  Since both of these items are limited resources (durability via repair kits) which you don't find on creatures then you will eventually exhaust one or the other and then not be able to do combat at all.\n\nThe 'stealth' aspect is equally useless and ultimately self-defeating.  Stealth in this game allows you to [possibly] walk by some enemies (but not cameras or turrets) but provides absolutely no combat use.   Stealth ends when combat begins.  You can re-enter stealth in combat but I can't see a reason for this because apparenlty the entire level knows of your existence until the end of time once combat is entered.  If you use stealth to bypass enemies you gain no experience (in either 'classic' or 'oddity' XP mode since about 1/2 of oddities drop from dead enemies.)","January 3","false","31.0"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","8","20","0","0"

Good luck, because unless you're sacrificing chickens to the RNG gods you will simply be hunting around looking at BLACK LOADING SCREEN after BLACK LOADING SCREEN after BLACK LOADING SCREEN for gear that suits your specific build.\n\nAlso, if you plan on hoarding I hope you're ready for the archaic weight mechanics that involve instantly slowing you down obnoxiously, I understand this penalty is meant so that player's do not have massive amounts of items for combat, but slowing you down during noncombat is just painful and unnecessarily punishes the more mercantile players, other games handle this siginificantly better.\n\nSpeaking of BLACK LOADING SCREEN, this will be a big chunk of your gaming experience, these are skyrim tier loading times people, 20 seconds plus, in 2015 now 2016 this is just unacceptable, I have fallen asleep playing this game before.

I've reached the junkyard and gotten into the old area. There's simply no possible way to beat these enemies, stealth around them or pursue any other way of moving forward. It also doesn't seem like there's anywhere else I can go and get any stronger due to the oddity system, so I'm at what is commonly called a fail state. There simply is nowhere to go, nothing to be done and no possible way to continue. There's just no sense in beating my head against this wall anymore.\n\nThat's too bad, because there's a lot I liked about this game.\n\nI like the environment, mood and seemingly interesting gameworld.\nI like the tactical options.\nI like the writing.\nI like the old school graphics.\nI like the idea of the oddity system.\nI like the old-school tactical combat.\n\nHowever, there's too much I don't like.\n\n- I don't like dying every 5 seconds and I have been ever since I started playing.\n- I don't like save scumming every battle to try to get through an area because I'm dying every 5 seconds.\n- I don't like being stunlocked virtually every single battle.\n- I don't like the lack of information on quests, areas, monsters, skills and virtually everything else.\n- I don't like the long walking times with no quicktravel, especially in a game that uses encumberance. Old school is fine but then again there's a reason that every RPG the last 15 years has incorporated things like maps and quicktravel - it's simply a way to keep players from being annoyed and their time wasted.\n- I don't like the option of being able to craft and then never finding anything affordable to craft with. The carrot for crafting is held out but it doesn't seem to be achievable.\n- I don't like constantly having no money. Probably because I spent it all on psi skills that were poorly described and I was desperate to find something that actually works.\n- I don't like how the oddity system essentially can essentially create a fail state where the player cannot continue. At least in most other old school games you'd have the option of grinding a level or two to get ahead, but not here.\n\nIf someone has some suggestions on how to continue, I'm all ears. But I can tell you this - I cannot beat the enemies in that junkyard. I can't beat the bandits outside of it. I have almost no money left. I do not believe i can craft anything that's any better than what I already have. Someone suggested in another thread a vest + carapace but neglected to mention that the vests are unaffordable and the ballistics part doesn't exist in the game (or at least in mine) so it can't be crafted.\n\nHitting a failure state on "easy" in a RPG by a player who has been playing RPGs since the original Wizardry and Ultima 2 suggests to me that the game itself need some adjusting.

It feels like it could have been great, if only some critical tweaks had been made that the developer seems to refuse to make.\n\nPROS:\n- Awesome, old-school isometric RPG, ala Fallout 1/2.\n- Sprawling maps with a lot of opportunities for exploration.\n- Nice ambient music.\n\nCONS:\n- Balance is awful. There's not much reason to go with guns over psionics, because psionics don't run out of ammo/durability and almost always deal more damage with more debuffs against your enemies. Get a few Psi boosters and you are a killing machine. Your enemies will always have more AP than you, even with a perfect character build, meaning facing off against multiple enemies is next to a death sentence.\n- "Forced" (as in the alternative is near certain death) stealth, when stealth is broken as ♥♥♥♥. Don't even try being sneaky because no matter what you'll get seen, swarmed, and bombed to bits. Line-of-sight is useless as enemies turn on a dime.\n- Difficulty scales like a cliff wall. For the first ten hours or so of the game you'll pretty much be dying no matter what you do, even on easy difficulty.\n- Overcomplicated crafting system which, ironically, is very limited once you actually get down to making stuff. Collect hundreds of components and yet you can only use two of them for most things. And everything you loot will almost always be better than anything you can make, so there's not much point bothering.","December 23, 2015","false","8.2"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","36","9","25","4","0"

There are a lot of things to craft, areas to explore, and NPCs to talk to. As you progress along however, you will find that the games lacks variety. NPCs are like stick figures without any life and story. Only few of them actually does something as the game goes on (Jack Quicksilver for example), and most of them just stand where they are and do nothing.\n\nYou will also find that maps are frustratingly small to explore without much in them. This game does not feature a world map or anything so you will get lost a lot and you will curse the way-too-frequent black loading screens that disrupt with your gaming experience. I have no idea why the developers thought this was a good decision to make. I mean, it's ridiculous that your character cannot see what's ahead in the next red line when it is a straight ♥♥♥♥ing open corridor.\n\nWhat about combat you say? Well the combat was supposed to be one of the strong points in this game since there are way TOO MANY of them. But unfortunately the combat is filled with RNG moments in which if you miss a 95% hit, the enemies will lynch you with perma stuns and perma flashbangs. I don't know about you, but I call this a bad game design.\n\nIt really is unfortunate since combat system in this game is not bad at all. It has a solid rule and solid system. The thing that ruins this severely is the fact that you are on your own from beginning to the end. If you pay attention to the enemies you fight, you will find that they have similar stats and are equipped with powerful weapons. If a game decides to take the approach of making the enemies as strong as you, it should focus more on 1v1 moments and exploration. Instead, this game butchers you with parties of 5 or more enemies in one small god damn area. I mean if they added at least one companion or something else in the game that can helps you to overcome these unfair situations, it would have been so much better.\n\nNow on to the quests and storyline. First of all, this game does not motivate you in any ways. I had no ♥♥♥♥ing clue as to why I should follow Hadrian's orders to basically charge into uncharted territory in which the dangers are not certain. I mean my character already has a ♥♥♥♥ing room! He/she has a ♥♥♥♥ing citizenship! Don't I have any right to refuse the breach of human rights this 'supreme citizen' is committing to me? The main NPCs in this game are ♥♥♥♥ing psychopaths that send a valuable human resource into suicide missions. There is no help at all, and I have to ♥♥♥♥ing charge into the maps that contain ♥♥♥♥ing 8 mutants. Bad script? Tick.\n\nThe story itself is also not the most inspiring one. There are no memorable characters, and the main story doesn't seem to suck you into the world itself. Think about classic Fallouts. These games started with your desperate community sending you off on a mission to find hope. These starts themselves already inspired you to prioritize and look for the objectives. Compared to them, this game is nothing but a series of following orders.\n\n\nLook, I really want to like this game. It has a great style and the underground post-apocalyse theme is an interesting setting. It could have been an awesome game, and I could see its potentials buried deep under the deepest part of it. Bad design choices and uninspiring characters + storyline unfortunately ruins it.\n\nI am in no way saying that this game is not fun. It is a fun game. It's fun to make things, shoot things, and find hidden items. The problem is that this gets very repetitive very quickly.\n\n","January 11","false","38.5"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","3","13","0","9"

Nope, they stay stunned for one round before going into 'safe mode' preventing further stuns.\n\nYou can try sneaking past them...\n\nExcept oh wait you can't your stealth isn't high enough and they can see through the back of their heads, immediately getting a stun on you: the lone party member\n\nYou can go through the vents and use the emergency hatch to slip by them:\n\nBut it's locked and your picking skill isn't high enough\nAaaaaand the key is on a dead body surrounded by three of the immortal robots\n\nSo my only option is to leave and grind for the necessary picking skill.

It looks really in-depth and robust on paper, but the way that the dev implemented the skill system is extremely flawed.\n\nBasically, there are some builds or character archetypes that are absolute garbage. In fact, I would say most builds suck and you'll have to restart very often. I myself restarted several times trying to tweak my builds. This is not the soul of an RPG. Playing RPG's is about choosing a character or characters and progressing through the game with them. There shouldn't be any builds that suck, they should all be able to beat the game in your character's own unique way.\n\nRPG's are not contstantly restarting and optimizing your character's stats to the max, which is what you have to do in this game if you want to succeed. I was theorycrafting, looking at guides, talking to people, thinking about builds that might work, etc. Then I realized I had actually spent more hours doing this than playing the actual game itself.\n\nSo you might say this exactly what we saw with Pillars of Eternity. I'm sure that like Pillars, there is a legitimate way to design your character that they can beat the game and it could be a fun time. Problem is, there seems to be a very narrow margin of error. You could get lucky and pick the right build right away or unlucky and never figure it out after a dozen tries. Why take the risk when there are plenty of more thoughtfully designed games you could play?\n\nAlso the better builds seem to be really combat focused, so this game can kind of quickly become a pure action game. For example, stealth sucks, social skill checks are really rare, crafting and science skills aren't very useful, etc. When you combine this with terse and boring writing, the end result is a rather bland experience.\n\nEDIT: Quick bonus note here: after talking with other people, apparently the game is really really hard no matter what you do, requiring, and I quote, "insane amount of RNG and min/maxing". That's right, this game has a huge luck basis. If you like wasting time then you should play this game but if you want to play a game based on skill this is clearly not it.","December 28, 2015","false","19.0"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","4","18","0","0"

I waited it to be released so I can experience the complete version. Man it's a disappointment.\n\nIt's a step backwards from Fallout 2. You have no map, you have no journal for quests you're basically going blind around in the world. This is no Fallout 2 style game, it's way backwards when simple things like those mentioned above didn't exist.\nWhat's worse, the font and items are so small it's hard to make sense thus further adding to the frustration. If you take into consideration that NPC vendors only accept a couple of items to trade(as in buy from you) and that you have to scrape every single thing so you can survive you end up with a lot of frustration. And for what? A bland story? Almost nonexistent NPCs (they are just there to give you quests, they don't have much personality if any at all).\n\nYou know the recent Jeff Vogel games ( I haven't played the older versions)? A lot less advanced pleasurable than those. And I consider Jeff Vogel games to be average (but made by one man so I guess the comparison is fair, Underrail isn't made by a big studio etc).\nAlso, maybe I didn't get far enough but I didn't get any companions.

Just for starters. I'm not going to touch the subject of minuscule objects on minuscule objects not being noticeable even after highlighting them, with their names overlapping, or the lack of explanations about non-working skills.\nIn RPGs the interface is the second most important aspect.\nCoincidentally, the first is the true deal breaker: the ♥♥♥♥ing fonts.\nThe bigger font is unreadable, it's blurred, has irregular edges, feels shrunk and the dots inside make it a complete, total, absolute pain to read. I'd rather stare at my ugly mug in the mirror for a whole day than read that font again for five minutes more.\nThe smaller one is so tiny I think the game's author is some kind of sadist: with my usual screen resolution, 1900x600, I could smash my face on the monitor and still wouldn't be able to read it. With a lower resolution it starts to become only a pain to the eyes but obviously the game has been thought not to work with that because the help window (F1) doesn't fit anymore.\nAnimations are horrible, jerky, the whole game feels like running (because only the game runs, the main character won't and I couldn't find why) at 10 frames per second; the game relies heavily on icons, but they're all extremely small, badly drawn and hardly distinguishable.\nI'm definitely no graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, sometimes I still play ZAngband and I'll probably worship X-Com forever, but this game is literally a pain to look at, I played only 20 minutes but they felt like two hours.

There are some inconsistancys that just make no sense to me with the game as well.  Like how can I hit unerringly with a shard of ice with psionics, but if I try to throw a fireball it misses the mark nearly 100% of the time.  It makes no sense.  There is also a lack of heads up about how things work in the game.  If you use a lockpick to unlock something, that lockpick is used up.  Wish I would have gotten a heads up on that before I used it to unlock a door that I could have just as easily walked around to avoid...\n\nAlso, there is a learning curve to the game that could be avoided if there were tutorials that just explained things.  Like the notes function that keeps track of your quests.  There is nothing that tells you it's there unless you poke around the interface and find it.\n\nThe game seems pretty bug free to me.  And with the little time I put into to before deciding to move on to a different game, it seems like it would have a good story line.  But between the inconsistancys with Psionics, finding out that lockpicks were a one use thing, and dying because my fireballs missed 5 out of 5 times (I saw no way to train away the poor accuracy of the things, plus.  Why does a fireball ability have a 3 round cooldown, but all of the other abilites I learned have a instant cooldown?  Nothing is explained!)

Because game is ok.\n\nPeople going "oh em gee it is just like Fallout 1 and 2", you should stop, really. Because it is not. These comparison shouldn't even exist. Here is why:\n\n- protagonist motivation to do things is non existant, while in F 1&2 you have VITAL main quest from very start and everything else happens around it\n- side quests are very rare. I can only remember "hopper meat" and "burrowers nest" after 7 hours of play. All about killing things\n- no open world. "But you can go anywhere!". Yeah, but it still corridors and in most of them you'll just die horribly.\n- no fast travel or even "run" function\n- incredibly picky merchants. In post apoc surroundings, yeah\n\nIf you compare this game to anything, it should be games from Spiderweb Software or Eschalon books 1-3.\n\nNow to game itself.\nThis is clearly "min maxer" heaven.

Isn't it clear as day - if you rarely found something useful you value it more! Do you remember that feel of finding 10 mm SMG in Fallout? Or good item drop in Diablo 1? Or acquiring a good gun in FTL?\n\nLooks like Underrail buries itself under needles complexity. Core game is not so deep, so why make things overcomplicated?\n\nI wish all luck to developer as it is hard to make almost everything alone.

They have their idea of the game and they will not change things that are clearly bad design just because they are trying to be different... They at least do fix bugs and try to get everything in working order as soon as possible, but the development will not be influenced in any way, shape or form by the players even if certain mechanics are bad or things are not balanced properly.\n\nAnd that pretty much is the rest of the problems of the game.\n\nBalance between different combatstyles highly vary with some being absolute overkill and others not being good at all. Granted the game hasn't launched yet so there may be some more balancing down the line to make this better, however I wouldn't hope things will be balance at launch, in fact I don't expect them to be balanced in any other way than mods.\n\nThe game like so many others in the genre has a carry weight limit and very early on it will seem like this is ok, until you start finding things like sledgehammers and metal armor which weight far too much and make even a very high strenght character barely be able to carry anything... I can understand realism but a game is supposed to be a game at the end of the day and carry weight only do one thing which is breaking game immersion by forcing you to constantly stop what you are doing to go unload. This is made worse with the game having respawns in some areas.\n\nWorst than that is the vendor system. Now many games in the genre have vendors with limited supply of money and this much is part of Underrail, but if the problem was that alone it would be fine, however Underail also features vendors who only buy certain amount of items and in limited quantities too. What this means is that you can never sell all your loot, you'll be forced to leave a lot of loot behind or wait for vendor reset which I belive happens every 45 minutes.\n\nSo what does this means? Well you've cleared a place, you've spent a very long time going back and forth placing all your items in some container with easy reach, now you only have to sit next to the vendors for 3 hours to maybe be able to sell everything... So yeah the game pretty much forces you to leave stuff behind. Now even if you leave stuff behind you'll still have more money than you'll ever need, that is not the problem. The problem is that if you are not rewarded to go out of your way and explore, you might as well just do the main missions and rush for the end. There is no incentive to go out of your way and do side questing nor exploring.\n\nRemember the above problem? Well you still have too much money, that is yet another problem of the game. You can buy anything you need at any time which means the economy is not good at all. You'll only ever be without money very early on but quickly you'll go from no money to I can buy the entire store.\n\nThen we come to the crafting. It has been made slightly worse in some aspects, it was made better in anothers. There are some feats now to improve crafting but overall, crafting still isn't worth that much. Crafting doesn't keeps you ahead of the curve. For the most part of the game you will buy/find better weapons than what you can craft and when you finally start being able to craft better stuff, you are really close to the end of the game. No point in investing in something that will only pay off in the end, not to mention that you won't even need the bonus.\n\nAnd these are the major problems with the game. It really is a shame because when i first played it the only problem was the crafting. All other problems didn't exist (well there might still have been some balance issues but they weren't as bad). the game has a lot of depth to it, from character creation to character development and to how you engage in combat. The story is ok as far as I've seen. Definitly not Obsidian level by any means but still good enough.\n\nThe game had all the opportunities to be the next Fallout. Granted with a bit of a Metro spin on it. Unfortunatly the problems I described above just make the game completly unplayble so I'll have to give it a negative review. Maybe after the game is released someone will mod the game and actually make the game good and worth it's price but as it is. It isn't worth your time even if it was free.\n\nEdit for the release: As of today the game was released. All of the above problems still exist in the game. While I'd love to recomend this game it just is a nightmare to play with ridiculously low carry weights and merchants not buying even a 1/4 of your loot. Exploration as such is unnecessary because who cares about loot when you can't carry it or even sell the almost nothing you can carry.\n\nMy sugestion, wait until a modder makes this game actually worth playing.","April 1, 2015","false","71.8"," 11 of 55 people (20%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","20","11","55","9","2"

Yes, even worse than Star Wars Furry Fan fic.\n\nIt seems like the programers thought, like many do, "Writing is easy! We don't need to hire a writer!" In Underrail's case, it's even worse than that. I doubt they have ever read a novel or non-fiction book cover to cover outside of R.L. Stein's Goosebumps.\n\nGod, I'm not asking for an "Infinite Jest","The Idiot", or "Blood Meridian." Trust me, someone who knows basic sentence structure and the common sense to avoid the most boring of all cliches (like the thief in the corner who gives out jobs from the Corporation (TM) that are too secret for even YOU to know any of the details or the macho commander dude at the company's barracks who will punch you out if you give a smart ♥♥♥ answer to one of his questions and since he has muscles he HAS to have no personality) will suffice.\n\nTo make matters worse, the game gets really confused if you the story line out of order and makes no attempt to prevent you from doing things in the precise order that you chose. Ho hum. Wish I could get my 10 bucks back, not because I really need the money, but because I feel these "developers" misrepresented both their product (as more finished than it really was),  the time they spent (if they did spend a lot of time, it was only with 3 people on the project),and themselves (as actual literate adults) .\n\nYour humble man slave,\nSludge.","December 13, 2013","false","0.7"," 62 of 216 people (29%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","29","62","216","3","20"

This hidden gem, which took me a while to find, turned out to be one of the most addictive, immersive, challenging games I'd played in quite a while. If you loved the Jagged Alliance series, the original Deus Ex, Fallout and Shadowrun -- this game takes a lot of what made those games great and puts it all in one neat little package. I've found this game to be relatively challenging, but not in an annoying way - there are always multiple solutions for pretty much any situation one might find themself in. The graphics aren't the most amazing thing on the market, but I got used to them fairly quickly - they do have some character of their own, and do well to immerse one in the game. Almost 20 hours in, and it still feels like I am learning, like everything is still brand new. Very impressed with this game, particularly the writing, the design and the mechanics. This game is pretty much a must-have for those interested in turn-based RPG adventures and for under $10, buying it is a no-brainer.","December 22, 2014","true","19.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Old school graphics, yes, but really good gameplay and I can't wait until the full release!\nBut (yes, there are a few buts!): It's also a really really hard game. It is simply to difficult to start with....it starts out really hard. It shouldn't. Characters of level 1, 2, 3 or even level 4 should be encouraged to strive for yet another level, not die all the time.\nI hope game-balance will be adjusted in the final release.\nAnother but is the lack of money. It's way too hard and time-consuming to make a good buck. This means that you typically don't have any money to buy healing potions or better weapons. This should be easier.\nFinally I really miss fixed components, so you will be able to craft at least a few things when you reach level 4 (or 5). The crafting idea in Underrail is superb - it just needs the last 5%.\nOver all Underrail is a fabulous game in my opinion - a true diamond in the rough!
