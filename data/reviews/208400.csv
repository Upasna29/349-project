"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/recommended/208400/","mastatsan","Carlz0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/","1578 products in account","I've been loving this game so far.  I was recently reminded that I had this, because of the release of Crystal Souls just the other day.. and boy am I sorry I forgot about Avernum for this long.  I should have played this ages ago!\n\nFirst thing I wanted to do was clear up the order these games are supposed to be in, because with so many Spiderweb Software games, it can be a little confusing to newcomers (like myself, until I did some research)\n\nThis is a remake of "Avernum" which itself is a remake of "Exile: Escape From the Pit".  The newly released Crystal Souls is a remake of Exile 2/Avernum 2.  Exile 3/Avernum3 is also supposedly getting a second remake in the future.\n\nI know that sounds confusing, so just know that this game, Avernum: EFtP is the first game, remade for the second time. Also, I've been told that the stories are self-contained, so you don't really HAVE to play them in order.  Though, with a world as unique as Avernum, I bet it helps in understanding the lore a bit.\n\nSo what makes this world so unique?  Most fantasy RPGs take place on the surface of a very earth-like world.  There's plains, mountains, forests, rivers, lakes, etc.. it all looks very familiar.  In Avernum, that sort of place exists.. but that's not where you play.  You, your party, and countless other individuals have all been exiled to the underworld.  It's a vast underground cavern, whose light comes from glowing moss on the ceiling.\n\nPeople survive by growing edible mushrooms, and receiving occasional supply shipments from the Empire.. the very people who sent everyone down here.  There are some cows, sent down by the empire, but without proper food, they grow sick and weak quite quickly.  Mages have managed to create things that kinda look like trees, just so the citizens have wood to build with.\n\nMagical equipment is extremely rare in this world.. It's all but impossible to create any, so most of it comes from adventurers who were sent down to Avernum with their gear, then were killed and looted.  It's a harsh world.\n\nDespite all the hardships, though, people have banded together to form towns, forts, and a government.  Of course some still decide to rebel and become bandits, or seek a way to rise into a position of power, but most people seem to live in harmony and cooperate.  And that's a good thing, because if they didn't work together, they'd never be able to fight off the Nephilim (cat people who hold a grudge against all humans for being sent down to Avernum) and the Sliths (lizard men, apparently native to Avernum, and most of them crave human flesh.)\n\nThe gameplay is exellent.  At the beginning of the game, you create a party.. your people can be whatever class you want, or 'custom'.  You spend a lot of your time walking around as a party, talking to people, getting quests, learning about the world, etc.. there are blacksmiths and such in every town, to buy equipment from.  There are secrets to find, and plenty of loot to pick up..\n\nWhen you're not in a town or dungeon, you'll be on the overworld, where everything is zoomed way back.  You can encounter enemies, special events, and other stuff out on the overworld.. and of course also travel from place to place.  The overworld is pretty darn big, and there are a lot of places to go.\n\nWhen in combat, the game turns turn-based..  You move and attack with your characters one at a time.. Each character has a certain amount of AP to move with, and are allowed to attack once, or cast 1 spell per turn.. It's simple, but not TOO simple.  It has a good flow, without sacrificing too much strategic depth.\n\nWhen you level up, you're able to assign attribute points, improve your skills on the skill tree, and sometimes pick a new perk/feat as well.  Pretty basic leveling up, but again simple/basic isn't a bad thing.  The game manages to do a lot with what seems like simple mechanics.\n\nThe main thing that will be an issue for some is that the graphics look very dated... and I'm sorry to repeat the same thing everyone else says, but here it goes... Graphics aren't important.  Maybe it's different for people not old enough to have grown up with older-looking graphics, but it doesn't bother me.  Sure, I like a pretty-looking game from time to time.. but it's really not a requirement for me.. but, of course, not everyone will agree.  Everybody has thier own opinions.. so take a look at the screenshots.  If it looks unbearable to you, don't get it.  If you think you can put up with oldschool graphics in order to play an amazing game, get it.\n\nAnyway, I feel like I've written a much longer review than most people will bother to read, so I'll cut it short here.  Thanks for reading.","January 16, 2015","true","10.9"," 129 of 134 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","129","134","2","3"

I carry pictures of Avernum around in my wallet.\n\nThis game used to be called Exile, and I was obsessed. I was a nerdy fat kid with a bowl cut and poor social skills. This game was my happy place. It's funny and clever, well-written, in-depth. No loose ends, no DLC, no fear. Unless you cast a fear spell. Then there is fear.\n\nIf you like RPGs and you support Indie studios, please buy this one, pretty please. They are a husband & wife team who had a staff as small as three people to make what has become one of the most epic series of games I've ever encountered. Not only that, but I remember them being so nice and helpful when I was a kid and writing them to ask questions about their game. There was no Google. Mind you, this was during a time when MYST had a pay-to-ask hotline, so it was a BIG DEAL that they got in touch. Oh, the nineties.\n\nDon't expect flashy graphics or quick-time events. This is 2D and it's pretty straightforward. There are no cutscenes. Don't expect lazy gameplay where everything is spelled out. Death is unavoidable. SAVE & be prepared with a notebook.\n\nDo expect one of the best, most engrossing, most interesting games of all time. You've been exiled into an underworld full of magic, strange beasts, and those noisy things I try to avoid all the time. You know the ones. People. They need things killed, items fetched, and hugs. Hugs with swords and screaming and demons. And also that mage was on fire when I got here.\n\nYou'll get out of it what you put into it. Use your imagination and memory for once, oh and also it wouldn't kill you to shower and shave and call your mum.","February 1, 2015","true","118.6"," 91 of 95 people (96%) found this review helpful 57 people found this review funny","96","91","95","57","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/208400/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","Second remake of the classic Exile series' first part, Avernum: Escape From the Pit is classic roleplaying at its best! Basically, you play as a party of adventurers, who were exiled into a huge cavern, Avernum, far below the surface of the world. You have to find a new purpose here, which basically means doing all kinds of odd-jobs and quests for mayors, wizards and kings of the underworld and, while you're at it, trying to escape your dark prison.\n\nThe controls have been streamlined for the 2010s. Like in Avernum, the first remake, the game is still isometric and tile-based. However, you can finally control the characters efficiently with a mouse. This works splendidly, though the controls have frankly lost some of the function of the earlier games: e.g. you can no longer close doors (unless I've yet to discover how). Also, the pathfinding algorithm does some weird stuff sometimes when your preferred path is blocked, making characters run into wrong direction (and at worst, their DOOOOM). There's still no music (except in the title screen and the few cut scenes): use your favorite epic adventure music instead.\n\nSkill system has basically been remade, though the comedic art of the skill descriptions has been appreciatively retained. Skills are now learned in trees, with a basic skill in the bottom and every subsequent skill requiring the below skills before they can be developed. Also, characters gain bonus traits every few levels gaining small bonuses to different skills and stats. It's a matter of taste if these are good or bad changes, but the whole works nevertheless quite fine.\n\nCombat has always been a rather important part of Avernum series. Turn-based, the basics are still there. However, some additions and changes have been made. Warriors have gained special skills called battle disciplines to supplement their fighting ability, making them a bit more interesting and tactical than before. Spells have been remade as well since original Avernum. Particularly, all the blessings and curses have become area effects, and multi-hit spells are now cone or area attacks instead of simply hitting a number of targets.\n\nFrankly, the hard-coreness of the series has dulled quite a bit with this latest installment. No longer are the dark dungeons truly dark, as you don't benefit from bringing a torch or casting light spells (which were actually removed altogether). There is no need to eat to satisfy hunger nor deal with dangerous diseases, and death is no longer so much a set-back as party is automatically resurrected and healed at a friendly town, removing the need for inns and renting rooms. You may no longer jump down ledges (which was never that healthy anyway). Identification of magical items has also been removed (albeit hilariously explained by "adventurers having better training nowadays"), and potion making has become a trade secret of alchemists, so your party can't learn it itself any longer. Spiders no longer say "hi!" in a high-pitched voice audibly. Along with these changes Avernum has lost part of its legacy and spark.\n\nWhat is left, however, is an excellent RPG adventure in a unique fantasy world. The streamlining makes the game more accessible and lets the player concentrate on what's really important: dialogue, exploration and questing. And their implementation is simply brilliant. There are tens, if not hundreds, of characters in the game who all have their own dialogue trees, and several tens of dungeons and towns to explore, everyone of them extremely detailed. Enemies are still dangerous, and mini-bosses and bosses are refreshingly difficult to beat.\n\nGame is not only high-quality, for there's also quite a lot of it. My first play-through, on Hard difficulty level, lasted about 80 hours. Want to just experience the story? Play on Normal or even Casual difficulty, and you may even change it mid-game. However, the highest difficulty level, Torment, provides an amply named challenge for an experienced player, requiring advance planning and lots of re-exploring in areas that were previously too dangerous. Seriously though, I recommend playing your first game on Hard difficulty at max, as Torment can get tedious if you don't know where to go for the next admissible challenge.\n\nTL:DR?\n\nExcellent dialogues.\nRobust tactical combat.\nAddicting exploration.\nEpic questing to become true heroes.\n\nNot convinced? You may as well give it a try.\nThe demo is available at http://www.avernum.com/avernum/index.html, letting you play through, I believe, about one third of the full game.","December 1, 2013","true","130.6"," 88 of 92 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","88","92","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/recommended/208400/","Monukai","monu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monukai/","1200 products in account","In today's day and age, Spiderweb Software's games may seem like a novelty, but make no doubt that for the right audience they are exceptionally good games that offer a lot of bang for their buck. Avernum: Escape From The Pit is a modernized version of the Avernum series, and while the graphics are still not flashy the game more than makes up for it with good writing and solid turn based combat.\n\nThe game is a text heavy one, a blessing or a curse depending on the person playing. The writing is stellar and coupled with the low-key graphics it's one of the few games where you can really use your imagination if you so wish. It is worth noting that Avernum is an open-world RPG, so while I say the writing is stellar, don't expect a centralized story with deep characters--that's not what this game is. The game itself takes place in a huge underground cave complex, a joy for those like me who like underground fantasy settings and even for those who don't should still appreciate the unique and interesting world Avernum presents.\n\nAvernum is lengthy, but if it's your type of game it will feel just right, making it a great game to pick up if you're on a budget. One playthrough alone will take  about seventy to eighty hours if you are a semi completionist, and even if you aren't I would wager it would take a good fifty hours to beat. Throw in harder difficulties and achievements and you can easily extend that playtime twofold.\n\nThe combat is fairly atypical for a turn based game, but by no means bland. Each ally/enemy gets one turn per round and there are different types of characters your party can contain (priests, mage, etc.). The game is open world as mentioned and it lets you explore the world on your own, the game guides you very loosely but the bulk of the exploration is up to you to do. As thus, you can easily find yourself faced off against baddies that are higher level than you which can keep the game challenging even on normal difficulty.\n\nOpen world exploration in the deep caves of Avernum mixed with some awesome writing and very interesting in-game encounters made this game a blast, but one of the things I liked most was how seamlessly the keyboard was integrated into the game. With the exception of needing to use my touchpad to click on a few interactive objects in the game world and assigning character stats/equipping items, just about everything you need to do in-game can be done with just the keyboard. Conversations, looting, fighting, moving--can all be done with the keyboard. If you're playing at home on your desktop, this may not mean much, but if you want to play this on a laptop without a mouse handy, this game is the one. Very few RPGs can be played on low-end laptops and even fewer can be played without a mouse, but Avernum is perhaps the only game I've played that's required mouse/touchpad input so sparsely. I feel like I could have enjoyed an amazing RPG experience from any Spiderweb game, but this one stands out to me due to the stellar keyboard integration.","July 28, 2014","true","70.7"," 69 of 74 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","69","74","0","0"

Avernum: Escape From the Pit is essentially a remake of the original Exile game of the same name. Escape From the Pit has been given a graphical overhaul, utilizing the isometric view used in the Avernum games released most recently by Spiderweb Software. The remake changes more than just the graphics, however, and the result is a game that is both the same and quite different from the original.\n\n======================================\n\nPros\n+ Old School style CRPG with plenty of replay value.\n+ Game-play: Explore the open world as you please and do it at your own pace.\n+ Really good lore for the game world\n+ A ton of sights to see!\n+ Engaging story\n\nCons\n- The UI is clunky and the character sheet & Inventory is annoying at times!\n\nNeutral\n+/- Doesn't hold your hand at all. (This is a good thing to me)\n\n======================================\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Avernum series is based in Avernum, a subterranean nation far under the surface of the world. The surface is ruled by the Empire, a single, monolithic power under the command of the cruel Emperor Hawthorne.\n\nEveryone on the surface who speaks out, rebels, or doesn’t fit in is sentenced to life imprisonment in Avernum. Prisoners are expected to die, the victim of starvation, horrible monsters, or simple despair.\n\nThe Avernum series tells the tale of the Avernites' struggle to survive, avenge themselves upon the Empire, and win both freedom and a return to the surface world.\n\n======================================\n\nGame-play\n\nAvernum: Escape from the Pit is a single-player role-playing video game. The player controls a group of up to four adventurers, who can use melee weapons, missile weapons, magic, or a mix of these skills to defeat opponents.\n\nOne of the better aspects of this game is the opportunity to customize your adventuring party. Whether you want to have a balanced group featuring every type of character or whether you instead choose to enter battle with an entire team of tanky sword-wielding knights; the game accommodates your decision. You are also allowed to select an image avatar for each of your heroes (whether it fits their class or not is up to you). That having been said, classes make relatively little difference in your characters' long-term potential, as every character can learn every spell and ability regardless of their class. The way this works is that requirements to wield spells are determined by the stats and skills that you develop for a character - meaning that you can choose to make your units as specialized or balanced as you please. Fan of sword-wielding battle mages who can heal their team in a pinch? Not a problem. Want to throw in a super-defensive tank that will soak up damage and demand enemies' attention? Easy. Escape From the Pit allows for such customization without over complication. A downside to this is the risk that characters will become a little generic, but the multitude of customizable aspects (stats, skills, spells, and "traits", which function as passive boosts to a character's stats or abilities) help to ensure each of your units is a unique personality.\n\nEscape From the Pit offers several difficulty levels, as well as the ability to adjust the difficulty at any time during your game. This might come in handy depending on how quickly you want to beat Escape From the Pit, because often you will find that enemies are just too difficult and you need to go grind somewhere else before advancing to where you want to go. Yes, Escape From the Pit does involve a lot of grinding in dungeons, but Spiderweb Software has done a great job making this experience far less tedious, with diverse and well-designed environments that often use interesting tricks to create light puzzle elements. The world of Avernum is by no means boring and progressing through the game is both fun and challenging.\n\nAll things said, it seems there's a lot beneath the surface here, with plenty of things to see and do that will keep you adventuring for many hours.\n\n======================================\n\nGraphics\n\nIf you're looking for up-to-date, modern graphics, you might as well stop reading now. Avernum utilizes 2D graphics in an isometric view, reminiscent of the original Diablo. Obviously this makes the whole thing look quite dated. If you aren't immediately turned off by that, then let me assure you that you will probably love this game. Noticeably improved even over those of the most recent Avernum titles are the character portraits, which are in fact quite beautiful. Otherwise, the graphics are essentially identical to those of recent Avernum titles, reflecting Spiderweb's low priority on steady advancement in that area. This is something important to know because Escape From the Pit is a game that will polarize RPG players depending on how important visuals are to them.\n\n======================================\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, Avernum: Escape From the Pit is a solid RPG experience that combines classic style, a compelling story, and generous content to create an indie game that is very much worth your time. If you're looking for a complex single player RPG and value content at the expense of visuals, don't miss this title.\n\n======================================","July 9, 2015","true","13.2"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","49","53","0","1"

If however your take on a RPG is Diablo or Torchlight, forget it.\n\nThere is probably more storyline in this small download than in the entire Skyrim. There are many long hours of play ahead. I did a restart about 2/3 of the way through as my party was not strong enough and I had not distributed t6he party stats well, combined I have nearly spent as many hours now on this game as I did with DragonAge inquisition.\nDespite the old school graphics there is quite variety of terrain to explore.\n\nThe character development is good and straddles the boundary between too simple or too complex well. I suggest you pay attention to creating a balanced party, which is also an area that I feel could be improved. It is too easy to create parties that will simply not work. Having a bow user sounds great, but the game is heavily weighted to swords.\nAnother area which could be improved is the character conversation scripts. Old storylines do not disappear and too often you get into a dialogue that you have already been through a million times before with the NPC – it is almost as if the same people that wrote the  NPC scripting for Divinity Original Sin did this one too.\n\n","October 26, 2015","true","136.7"," 46 of 52 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","46","52","3","0"

RPGs thrived in the 1990s, and for good reason. Games like Avernum (when released in 1995, it was called Exile: Escape from the Pit) aimed to get their player lost in an intriguing world for hours upon hours, leveling up characters, exploring an in-depth story and learning about the game world from multiple NPCs with varying opinions on the world around them, and finding hundreds of secrets (yes, hundreds). These RPGs were made by developers with imaginations that were close to perfection, back when people made games because they loved games and sharing fantasy game worlds they'd created with others, not simply making them to drain wallets and hearts.\n\nThe game starts out after your party of characters (which you customize, of course) are thrown into the deep abyss known as Avernum. Avernum is a series of underground caverns that serves as its own subterranean nation far beneath the surface of the world, and is the trash bin that the powerful Empire uses to throw away people who speak out against its rule on the surface. It is effectively a prison, where you are locked away from sunlight and the surface forever--unless you plan to do something about it. It is here where the Avernum series distinguishes itself from many other RPGs. Although Avernum is not a dungeon crawler by genre, it has that feeling of isolation, desperation. You want to get OUT of this underground prison, and the injustices made against you and others you meet in Avernum make you yearn for revenge. Avernum is one of the few fantasy worlds with a dystopian feel; the Empire is this world's Big Brother, and you have the ability to get your revenge, try to escape, or even accept your fate and learn to embrace Avernum. (And thus, this gives you three separate ways to beat the game through various questlines.)\n\nThis is not a mindless RPG. Don't go into this game desiring mindless fun, for you will have to read quite a bit, manuever Avernum's cave systems via map systems, and retain information about quests, as the game doesn't hold your hand with doing so. The game does have a journal system that is VERY nice for its time; when you're speaking to an NPC who says something worth noting, you can "record" their speech with the click of a button, so you can pull this up at any time. This comes to be very useful, as quest notes don't update as you progress through a quest, so it's up to you to pay attention and know what the next step is. Despite all this, Avernum stays very much so to the right side of the line when it comes to tedium. I encountered no game-breaking quests during my playthrough like I have with other RPGs of the time (Divine Divinity, I'm looking at you, though I love you so). It IS possible to kill NPCs that you'll need for certain questlines, though the other questlines are still available, and there is also a cheat system to help you through this as a last resort (just look up your problem online).\n\nI think the best thing about this game is just how interesting it is. I love RPGs because I like escaping to a different world for a bit and getting lost in its complexities; I also love exploring and finding secrets, new towns, or a hidden area of a map. This game has that, and its story makes it even more worth finding those extra tidbits. This game has so much to do and so much to explore that it has what I like to call "Skyrim syndrome", where sometimes you'll look at your quest log and weep at all you've failed to complete. If throwing yourself into a world is what you're into, I can think of few better worlds than Avernum.\n\nI personally give this game a rating of 9.5/10. This is a must have for RPG fans and fans of games from the 1990s in general, back when games threw themselves at you with days worth of content with a grin that said, "I dare you." This is a game that you will work hard to conquer, a game that will make you feel liberated when you beat it, and a game that will be a source of fond memories for years to come.","July 20, 2015","true","62.0"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","7"

The game has been streamlined, interface made usable, and the graphics have improved (relatively speaking) since then, but much of the core draw (and mechanics) are still there.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys having wide open spaces, no demand to go down any particular linear plotline, and plenty of rewards for kicking over ever rock to see what wriggles out from underneath, this game has plenty of delicious exploratory goodness for you.\n\nThat said, I'm not as fond of the skill trees they've put in the new version of the game as the older point-buy system they had before. The point-buy system hypothetically allows for nigh-infinite varieties of hybrid characters, but largely forces characters into one of four types of characters: Melee Fighter, Ranged Fighter, Wizard, and Cleric. "Thief" is just someone who puts points into Tool Use, and you need Tool Use (there's no magic for opening doors without it) but there's nothing stopping any other sort of character from taking Tool Use, and the game only checks total party Tool Use skill levels, so it's easy to distribute. (No dedicated thief necessary.) You COULD use a ranged fighter, but melee combat is forced upon you fairly often, and you'll want a dedicated sword user and spear user to make use of the best weapons, anyway.\n\nYou're forced into making a character dedicate themselves to a given path by the nature of the skill tree: The high-tier skills like Riposte (counter attack chance) or Lethal Blow (critical hit power up) require plugging an equal or greater amount of points into the lower skills on the tree. Your Combat Disciplines (special abilities for fighters) are based upon total base weapons skill, and you'll want to put your attribute points into Strength or maybe Dexterity. Keeping up with magic spell tiers demands you stick points into a single base magic skill at least every other level, and dumping nearly all your points into Intelligence, and a couple into Endurance for the HP to not die in one hit. Hence, no matter what, you pretty much always wind up with sword fighter, spear fighter, cleric, and wizard. Hypothetically, there's bows and thrown weapons, but there are no good bows, and decent thrown weapons are too rare to use as a primary weapon.\n\nThere are some choices to be made (going for criticals versus riposte) but mostly, it devolves into putting all your points into the core sklls because on the harder difficulties, you'll miss every time if you don't plug every point you can into accuracy-boosting skills, and a melee tank needs all the hardiness they can get to survive. Likewise, wizard and cleric accuracy (yes, AoE spells miss) depend upon base magic skill, and base magic skill ALSO ups damage. Hence, there's no reason not to put points in every single level. It's really only a question of whether you need more damage-dealing skills or damage-resistance skills at a given level to survive, espeically on higher difficulties, and the number of utility skills like tool use or cave lore you need is surprisingly low, meaning you basically always put points into the same dedicated "purist" build all the time. It leaves one underwhelmed with the potential for customization.\n\nIn the original Avernum series, it gave you more points each time you leveled, but the costs of skills rose as you purchased more ranks in those skills, meaning that there was more possibility to "multi-class", as a skill you dedicated points into every level would rise as fast as the skill points you gained per level, while skills you neglected would become relatively cheaper by comparison. This meant it was easily possible to make a wizard who studied enough cleric magic to be a passable backup healer and a truly excellent wizard while the cleric was a passable archer.\n\nWithout the chance to really multi-class, you'll probably find that you're left with the same party time and again, as you're probably not going to want to play this game without a cleric or wizard, and you'll NEED a meat shield. Since this is the umpteenth trip to Avernum for some of us, playing the same party with the same character sprites in areas modeled on the same locations can give old hands a bit of deja vu all over again.\n\nIt is, yes, possible to play solo, and you'll want to generalize a little more in solo play, but even that kind of comes down to playing a wizard with some melee skill and a few healing spells.\n\nAlso unlike this game's predecessor, this game starts you off in a small dungeon for a minor tutorial on the basics, but quickly lets you roam as a free-range adventuring band. A few easily-dismissed text boxes shouldn't annoy veterans, but might help new players, so it's not a bad change. That said, I suggest new players save frequently, and have several "safe zone" saves, as they can easily bumble into more trouble than they can fight their way out of with no guard rails to keep them from merrily adventuring into danger out of their depth.\n\nAll the time and money they saved not going for pretty graphics (and if you're a Spiderweb fan, you'll recognize the reuse of a LOT of those graphics,) was put into making absolutely sprawling caverns.\n\nFor those of you who lamented Elder Scrolls' Oblivion/Skyrim's rubber-banded monster levels, rejoice as well, as the sliths just a few towns west of where you start WILL shishkebob you effortlessly. On the higher difficulty levels, this can curb your exploration somewhat, but with a mere 350 coins, you can buy a boat that lets you have access to a large portion of the map, so long as you don't mind having to hide from the fights. While not being able to fight something sounds limiting, you can gain access to spells early, which makes it worth the trip.\n\nThat said, there's still a few places you have to go, and a pretty clear order in which you have to go there. While it's hypothetically possible to do sequence breaks, steep ramping of the power of enemies means that, especially in higher difficulty settings, there's little capacity for a player to bypass one major dungeon and be prepared for the next.\n\nBecause you have access to all the spell trainers early (just have to dodge the monsters bigger than you) you can easily get spells meant for late-game early, but at the same time, you can't afford them. Spells cost 2000 coins to learn, and clearing a whole dungeon and selling absolutely everything only nets you 1000 coins... It doesn't really get better as you go on, either, until you've bought all your skill-ups, and then there's nothing left to buy at all. I've never seen a reason to buy potions or scrolls or even weapons, as, while some mid-level stuff is available in stores, by the time you can afford them, you have better artifact weapons you lifted off of corpses. Potions can be brewed from infinitely-respawning herb patches for free, so there's at least reason to use those.\n\nAlso, you ram through MP quickly in this game, especially later on, but just setting foot in town restores all HP and MP for free... You have skills to reduce MP use, but why use them when you need every skill point in magic power to survive a single fight, and can just go back to town for a refill after literally every fight? There are a handful of dungeons where you do have to "fight your way back out" (monsters spawn in after you get to the end of the dungeon), but it's rare enough that you shouldn't have trouble sitting on a pile of 30 magic potions to refill between fights if you really need it.\n\nIf you're at all interested in the genre, it's dirt cheap and provides easily 100 hours of gameplay.","October 21, 2015","true","114.3"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","27","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CNYGamer/recommended/208400/","CNYGamer","CNYGamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CNYGamer/","62 products in account","I really enjoy this game. It is a turn-based, isometric view (Diablo-style view looking down from above), single-player fantasy roleplaying game. Let me break that down:\n\nTurn-Based: While not in combat you move your party around exploring wilderness, dungeon, and city environments and interacting with various friendly and hostile NPCs (non-player characters controlled by the computer). When battle starts, the game goes into turn-based mode. People who like the fast and furious action of real-time games like Diablo might find turn-based combat to be slow and tedious. I like it because I can let my attention wander if need be or even walk away for a restroom break right in the middle of battle. It also allows for the formulation of tactics based on the battlefield conditions.\n\nIsometric View: Many RPGs in the 90s used isometric view. The view is from above and slightly at an angle like the Diablo games. It's nice because you get a kind of "god's eye view" of the game area.\n\nSingle-Player: There is no multiplayer option for Avernum: Escape From the Pit.\n\nFantasy Roleplaying Game: The environment is traditional "Western medieval style fantasy" (i.e., swords and armor and spells and fantasy monsters). There is a bit of a twist in that the game opens up with your being exiled via magic teleportation to a supposedly inescapable underworld where criminals and political prisoners are sent when they cause problems for the Empire.\n\nYou can choose from a number of traditional classes (sorcerer, warrior, rogue, berserker, priest, etc.) or you can create your own classes. The pre-made classes are merely certain selections from the game's many abilities, skills, and powers available to characters both when they are created and as they level up. Selecting a pre-made class does not pidgeon hole your character because as you level up you can choose to improve any abilities, skills and powers.\n\nThere are multiple difficulties to choose from ranging from beginner to nightmare. You can even change difficulty whenever you wish. So things are going to easy? Notch up the difficulty. Getting frustrated by how hard the play is? Notch it down.\n\nFor $10 you absolutely cannot go wrong. This is a fantasy RPG in the tradition of 90s games. I used to play the SSI gold box D&D computer games and Avernum is a great game in the same tradition.","January 5, 2014","true","46.0"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","30","33","0","0"

There was only a few times I felt it was tedious play and that was with the friggin horrible "lights go out, so you must click millions off times to move inches" periods. The game does have a few minor bugs, like some times in teleporting your party members can end up inside room objects and freezes game for reload and if you happen to double click when casting sometimes your party members cast fake spells and move (when not supposed to move at all) so wasted turns can happen in middle of battles. BUT even with those minor bugs, the game was so fun and challenging I didnt mind over looking them. Newer more expensive games with better graphics have been doing much worse lately. Just suggestion, but go into settings and set party to move in fast mode or you might want to kill them yourself waiting to move very far!

I tried doing 3 warriors and a healer and ended up struggling at the end despite being "overleveled". I tried doing only ranged/mage and found myself in situations where the maps were very clearly not laid out with any sort of thought to tactical retreating.\n\nThere's also no real story behind much of the game. Which, for D&D clones where the whole point is dungeon crawling a good story and redeem most bad mechanics. It's really you just make your way across the map and kill stuff for people as quests. Even the mainstay of fetch quests are really more like "go clear this castle the thing I want is at the top" style of quest than anything else.\n\nCombat is bland. Turn based with speed modifiers. AoE spells are extremely overpowered in basically every situation. Mobs love to aggro from ridiculous distances and you can easily end up fighting a whole floor at once when somebody sees your party through a wall and picks up 20 or so friends on the roundabout way to join the fight.\n\nEquipment is a joke. Your whole party will most likely end up wearing the same set of steel armor -- even my mages did -- because of how broken the skill system is.\n\nWith nearly 60 hours of game play there is nothing memorable about any of it other than my annoyance that there are two places where you can actually get stuck with no way out and I managed to find both of them.\n\nThere's not really any redeeming qualities about this game, it's a bland D&D clone that's entirely unmemorable.\n\nPros\n+ 8 hours of playtime\n\nCons\n- No story\n- Skills don't work right\n- Little realistic customization\n- Illogical pathfinding","December 7, 2014","false","58.4"," 58 of 96 people (60%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","60","58","96","6","0"

For many gamers that may be correct, but I'm from the DOS era and can easily enjoy games with poor production values but entertaining play.\n\nThe basic story / setting involves an authoritarian government that banishes its malcontents to a massive cave system called Avernum where they are expected to suffer and die rather than sow discord among the surface dwellers.  Enough get banished in this way that, over the decades, a shaky civilization is formed.

The game combines exploration, action point based combat, and a simple but surprisingly detailed storyline.\n\nAfter getting through the starting dungeon, you're thrust right into the middle of the Avernum, an underground world full of criminals of the surface Empire with no known means of escaping to the surface. You aren't given a central objective that the game forces you to persue throughout the game, and in fact, there are 3 different game-ending quests that you can complete. You're given the whole world to go through, and you can complete quests in any order you'd like (although some areas require certain items to access, like an orb that grants the power of flight). The towns and NPCs are colorful, although because of the nature of the game, there aren't too many NPCs with more than a few lines of dialogue.\n\nThe combat system is simple, but offers plenty of options for tactical play. The system is action point based, and learning how to take advantage of it with abilities like Haste, Slow, Battle Frenzy, Sniping, and Adrenaline Rush is required to beat Avernum's greatest challenges. You also have to learn how to best make use of terrain, crowd control, and knockback abilites: moving through a space adjacent to an enemy uses up 4 of your action points instead of just 1, which allows you to set up choke-points to protect your weaker characters. Torment mode is particularly difficult, and because it's nearly impossible to power level (enemies in dungeons  rarely respawn), you're required to use every dirty trick you have available to win.\n\nCharacter development and levelling up is fairly basic. The party you play with has 4 members, all of which are created at the beginning of the game. You have 4 main stats (Strength, Dexterity, Endurance, and Intelligence, which do exactly what you'd expect), which go up slowly on their own, and you get 1 point to allocate yourself every level. You also get 2 skill points a level, which go into a branching skill tree which improves things like your casting power, ability to dodge, ability to unlock doors/disarm traps, and gather herbs. This means you aren't restricted to any particular archetypes or classes, and can develop your characters however you want (although certain hybrid character may not be the most effective in combat). You also get a trait every other level, which varies from making your character more likely to be attacked, to selling items for more money, to being able to cast spells in heavy armor. There's nothing about this that stands out immensely, but you are able to make a variety of characters.\n\nThe game's graphics are somewhat mediocre, but it's not the focus of the game. There is also no background music in game, only ambient noises. Personally, it doesn't bother me much, but it could be jarring to others. While it should be the standard for games nowadays, I was impressed by how few glitches were in Avernum. Only 2 come to mind, and neither are game breaking (War Blessing only gives a 2% bonus instead of 10%, and targetted AoE spells have unlimited range if centered on an empty space). After the glitchfest of games like Fallout New Vegas, it's relaxing to see a game so free of crashes and progress halting glitches.\n\nOverall a fantastic game. I've probably put more time into Avernum than any other single player RPG (my 150 hours is from two separate playthroughs). It's simple, fun, and a great exploration experience.","January 3, 2015","true","153.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game is far butchered now compared to it's older version.\n\nBefore: Up to three levels of spells in both priest and mage classes so that you can indulge in a magic fantasy playing the game. With secrets at every turn for your wizard to decode and dangerous territory where they have to show their wit in using their magic to upgrade their arsenal and using it creatively to beat the lords of magic themselves, the slitheraki or however you spell that...\n\nNow: Even with three levels of spells you are limited to 5 spells either mage or priest. Mages might as well be replaced with archers until you find a spell that can hit more than one target. Priests are nice for minor heal but cannot bless the party for a long time.\n\nNow:\nSpeaking of buying, selling and upgrades... nothing you get from battles is worth anything... There are times that have values that shops will not take anywhere. Items worth 240 suddenly worth 6 in a shop...\n\nBefore:\nThings costed alot but you could sell items during battle, find money and not [5 coins] per 3 mobs or even find loot that is an upgrade to what you had without going into their preset dungeons.\n\nBefore:\nA game about survival where your party had to eat in order to sustain themselves so sleeping outdoors while sometimes bad was a way of hunting AND healing your party. If you didn't play this well, you'd end up with having to remake characters you put time into because they died. [Unless you found/decoded a high level revive spell]\n\nNow:\nThe revive spell is in the game but... what's the point!? You can walk into town and get free heals. "Survival" You don't need to eat anything. The food items aren't even worth picking up, they heal you for garbage amounts. Speaking of which rather than enriching their item pool and allowing you to diversify how you play, they've just created more garbage for you to pick up.\n\nBefore:\nThe game was hard but you could select information out of conversations you had with people in order to find interesting things to do and tidbits of information. The quests that you took up on your own accord were the experience to level up your party and when you came back to claim the gold reward after barely surviving that was the icing on the cake.\n\nNow:\nTHe quests give experience because the mobs sure don't give enough. You are forced into conversations where you have pre-established answers which sound nothing like what you'd even ask about in a conversation to the point where it makes you seem really naive or stupid. Hell half of the information you can ignore and walk into who needs conversations anyway. Also they'll mark it on the map for ya, no need to explore or be a cartographer.\n\nBefore:\nHaving useful skills in and out of combat was possible and while not needed sometimes made the return to civilization what little you got pretty fun.\n\nNow:\nSome things are taken out because during a level up you really don't get all that much to train yourself. It's probably due to the fact that the items and money drops from mobs are garbage because in the old Exile you had to not only have leveled up to train and allot points, you also had to pay for the training. Now you somehow train yourself cuz you know everything you just don't have "EXP" and only casters suffer the need of learning from someone else.\n\nBefore:\nArmor reduced damage, better armor reduced it better. These were flat amounts. You still needed hp, magic doesn't care about your armor and the strongest foes can use magic that you like to use all the time!\n\nNow:\nEnemies don't need to use magic to overwhelm you because armor only increases the damage you reduce by a percentage. So rather than buying something nice to actually protect yourself it's more like you will always take damage from a foe but can lower it somewhat. Mind you that healing in battle either cost money [which you won't have] via potions or mana [which cannot be healed outdoors or in dungeons even by waiting in safe areas that you've explored and mapped like a smart survivor.]\n\nExile used to be a brutal game where you felt like you were thrown down the pit and each battle brought you closer to your goal of getting out. This version either you play at a low difficulty and give yourself a yawn fest or you play at a high difficulty and wonder why you play. This isn't one of those "Strategizing rpgs" at that point, it becomes a luck and trial game because the game cannot sustain itself. I did play it on the strongest difficulty but that's because I played it before expecting the same fun gameplay with a tough twist. Instead the gameplay is boring and now feels like a rip off of newer games. [Questing for exp, dumbed down,  does not self sustain, barely on topic, pompous pretending to make something hard with modes when it's just a percentage modifier to things that are there already...

If not, here's the gist of it.\n\nSpiderweb Software is an amazing company, and I originally discovered them through their Geneforge games. Now, I was skeptical when I first began playing Avernum because in my opinion it had a lot to live up to. I think I can now safely say that this is my favorite of all their games thus far. It is a remake of Avernum 1, which came out over a decade ago, and all it did was improve. Currently there is a gap in the story, because Avernum 3 has not yet been remade (though I assume you could go play the original) and so unless you're fine with skipping right over to 4, you'll just have to wait with bated breath.\n\nI know a few people who tend to ignore their games due to the admittedly strange graphics (how long can that man hold his arms like that, christ). While their portraiture and icons are very nicely done, they do skimp a bit in the 3D area, though I presume not for lack of trying. Having played a bit TOO many RPGs in days past I believe it to be somewhat nostalgic.\n\nIn short, the story is amazing, the art "antique", and the replayability significant.

It's pretty light on story and direction, and normally in large games without a story to hold my hand I wind up feeling a bit overwhelmed, but Avernum did a very good job in not making a big game "too" big.  The towns and world are the right size, and the packs of monsters you come across are challenging but never too much.  I also had quite a bit of fun hunting down caches and spell tomes, as a little extra something.\n\nThe only real problem I had was that towards the end of the game it didn't feel like there was any character or story progression left to my character, just a lot of loose ends leading up to the three many "winning" scenarios.  That made the last 5-10 hours a bit of a drudge for me, as I no longer had talent points to spend or fun gear to acquire.

Though, classes are pretty linear. Mages mainly focus on mage, priest on priest, and so on. You won't really be seeing many priests dual wielding, or sword-and-board mages. BUT, you can really specialize in certain skills, so though, you can't really roam outside the realms of your specific class, you can specialize it pretty well.\n\nThe combat is classic, old-school, turn-based goodness. The difficulty is decent. If you don't know how to play these types of games (learning to buff and debuff prior to battles, crowd control, and so on) this game will prove difficult. Once you get a hang of it, it becomes fun.\n\n\nAGAIN: If you are not a fan of engrossing yourself into lore, you will not get as much enjoyment out of this game as you could.

On the whole I think it's a good game, and fun to play if you like 90s-style RPGs, especially for the fairly low cost.\n\nIt's a big, open-world game with a significant number of quests and places to wander, and a sizable number of NPCs to interact with. The skills/traits and leveling system is fairly fun to play with. There are some issues that keep me from giving it a 100% positive review:\n\n1) If you play at higher resolution settings, it's going to be harder to see loot on the ground, and the numerous secret door switches that are pretty crucial for discovery and completing dungeons. But it will give you a better tactical view.\n2) Loot rewards are pretty flat - at level 30 (not technically a level cap, but more or less is one) I'm still using quite a bit of gear that dropped at level 5.\n3) The interface could be a bit better - different shortcuts to open/close windows is a minor annoyance\n4) Aesthetically isometric view is nice, but tactically it makes for some challenges, esp. since you can't rotate the camera. This can cause issues with moving if trying to fight tactically and occasionally targeting in combat.\n5) You'll hit 30 before running out of content, at which point only a handful of fights will really be that challenging. Given that semi-tactical combat is one of the upsides, the game loses something when that's gone, though Grah-Hoth was a fun challenge.\n\nThe biggest downside for me is really the quest log. The quests can really pile up, the log doesn't really track meaningful details, and quests can't be sorted or deleted.  Quests also stay in your log even when they can't be completed - a minor annoyance.\n\nThe lack of detail wouldn't be quite as big a problem, except for the size of the game. Even playing a few hours daily, at some point you'll be working on a quest you picked up several days ago, with often minimal guidance on where you're at in the quest progression. Solving it in-game may require revisiting multiple towns and finding multiple NPCs who may or may not be mentioned in the text.  As the game went along I found myself using internet tips a bit more often because the fun of running back and forth between towns (even with a portal system running to about half of them) had waned.\n\nBut on the whole it's a good game. I've put about 60 (mostly enjoyable) hours into it, and am only just past the first of 3 "game ending" quests.  It reminds me in some ways of a stripped-down Divine Divinity, which ironically I liked more but never finished.","February 22, 2015","true","82.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There's goold old turn-based combat, tons of secrets and a lot of world map exploration with special events.\n\nThe UI is kind of a pain in the butt (no automated inventory sorting, ESC to cancel out of spells / menus and pathfinding can be spotty) and the difficulty varies massively by area, with only a warning sign and NPC's advice separating you from having your legs removed by giant intelligent spiders.

Exploration of hidden areas is rewarding and the non-linear questing (take your own approach, or even finish before picking them up) gives it a realistic touch. Graphics snobs--this might not be for you. As someone who started gaming with Pong, I can appreciate this restyled version of an old classic. This version seems to start off slightly less bleak--could be the additional color.\n\nI've always liked the developers, who are even friendlier than those spiders that think I'm cute.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/skykid14/recommended/208400/","skykid14","skykid14","http://steamcommunity.com/id/skykid14/","237 products in account","I admit it, Avernum has captured me!  Every time I play this game, I end up playing well into the night, and on some occassions, into the next day.  Why is this game so addictive, why had I never heard of it before, and why is it so inexpensive???  I bought the Spiderweb collection which contained this game (the Avernum1 remake); bought it somewhat on a whim after reading about how the guy who composed all the music for "Faster than light" had gotten addicted to this "hidden gem".\n\nAvernum reminds me of Ultima7 crossed with Xcom from the '90s.  But Avernum is both challenging and easy to play.  There are so many handy shortcut keys that you can practically play the game from the keyboard.   I love love love the command system, if you want to continuously cast a particular set of spells, you can just keep pressing the same key-combo's so you don't even have to look at the menu options that appear.  I think the biggest problem with Ultima7 was that it was too easy to 1 - get lost in the map, and 2  - get confused about what you had to do with the mission.  Avernum thankfully not only keeps track of all the quests, but also pin-points their relevant locations on the map.  And when I compare it to XCom, I will say that I died so many times, ruthlessly, that it made the game impassable after a certain point and I gave up on it.  Not so with Avernum.  The game is "Generous" in that it provides you with many ways to go about improving your party so that you won't die after every-other battle.   However, it's challenging enough that I still have to "sneak" around corners everynow and then so that I don't fall into an Ambush.\n\nI got so "into" this game last year that I confess I had to put it down completely for a few months.  It was that engrossing.  The other day I started it up again, not even knowing where in the huge world of Avernum I'd left off, and within half an hour I was back along the quest trail, using all the command combo's.\n\nI must also mention the writing.  Kudos to the author!  I hear the game is solely developed by one man and his wife.  Is this true?  The writing is very nice, old school.  It's almost like playing a text adventure, and visualizing the story really gives you a sense of depth into the Avernum world.  There are also many many little secrets and hidden gems in the game.  For example, last night I battled through the temple of the "Sliths" (lizard people).  One of the items on the ground was "Fine Trousers" with a description that read along the lines that 'though the slith are wise, they have not yet found appreciation for a fine pair of trousers'.  I don't know, I just caught that when I saw it and thought wow, that's attention to detail.\n\nAvernum1 is the only game from Spiderweb I have played.  I actually can't wait to get my hands on Avernum2 which thankfully just came out (not to mention all the Geneforge and Avadon and other Avernum sequels).  There must be 10 years of gaming goodness in the Spiderweb collection.  But first I have to finish Avernum1.  I wish I could put my life on pause just to play this game.  Thank you very much Spiderweb software, this is the finest nostalgic euphoria one could have asked for.","January 28, 2015","true","61.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a remake of a remake of a game that came out in 1995, which is kind of surprising considering Escape From the Pit's graphics look like they're from 1995. Let's just say the original will make your eyes bleed. Now that we've gotten bashing the graphics out of the way, let's talk about the game itself. Avernum is a vast, expansive RPG that will take you around 60-70 hours to beat. Is it worth playing? Yes. It excels at everything it does. The world it takes place in is interesting and avoids many of the common fantasy tropes and pitfalls. The combat is enjoyably strategic and you feel a real sense of accomplishment after beating some of the harder enemies. The world is also filled to the brim with content and every enemy and item feels like it's been placed into the world with care and purpose. It's no masterpiece of writing, but it's far better than being merely servicable as a lot of RPGs tend to. The only real complaints of note are that the combat can get a bit silly at high levels and of course the graphics. Avernum is the type of RPG a lot of games wish they were and if you're fan of the genre you should definitely treat yourself to this one.","March 13, 2015","true","151.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Where do I start? I probably wasn't even 5 when Spiderweb Software came out with games but somehow they managed to reach our old Mac. Needless to say the original game was unplayable with the skill and attention span a child might have between the ages of 5 to 10 but something about the original Exile games managed to stick with my older brother who's 4 years older than me. He's followed Spiderweb's releases and remakes of Exile religiously ever since, so naturally he was ecstatic to see me checking out this remake on Steam. Having never touched the games aside from making a party, getting lost at the starting point and giving up, what did I think of this incarnation of a classic?\n\nThe first thing that's clear is how streamlined the interface has become, I believe Jeff has been working on making all the Avernum games run on the same engine to get them all consistant. It was a lot easier to maneuver through making a party and looking at all the spells/abilities... which used to have a lot more of to the point of insanity. Luckily, the spells that have been removed were either combined with other spells or removed because they really weren't necessary.\n\nQuesting and leveling is also pretty straightforward. Conversing with NPCs used to require you entering actually words yourself to get answers and information, now it's more standard with a choice of questions or answers to get what you want. The world itself feels large and lively with a map that you will be using a lot. There's a lot of choice in how your party gets shaped and your actions in questlines affect what happens at the end of the game for at least 3 types of endings.\n\nThere's no music in this game but the ambience and sound effects make up for that. If it gets too quiet for your liking you can run some of your own music to fit the mood, classical music was my choice and it fit surprisingly well. :) The graphics are also pretty simple but detailed enough to tell what's going on. Spell effects are different for each spell so you know what you just fired is indeed a fireball and blizzards are made of ice.\n\nCombat is done in turns and has each character in the battle using action points. Using all your action points ends that character's turn while saving action points smartly allows you to attack or move multiple times. There's various skills and spell effects, defending, mana conservation and looting to take into account in every battle so there's some pretty large amounts of strategy to this game. Running in blind is a very bad idea and you should save often however...even on easy you can get ambushed and overwhelmed whether it's a fort, dungeon or out in the open-world... some of the enemies run faster than you also btw. :P\n\nThe most unique thing about Avernum (and most of Spiderweb's other games) is the writing and sometimes bizarre humor. It's charming and sometimes unnecessarily descriptive about some items or people in the world of Avernum... it's also a legacy to Jeff's imagination all those years ago, he's admitted while updating these games that even he thinks he was crazy when writing them and he'll never be able to create something like them ever again.\n\nWhile admitting I am influenced a bit by the nostalgia, I think there's plenty for a new player to enjoy in Avernum if RPGs are their favorite pastime. There's a plethora of guides covering all sorts of playthroughs and party builds. This game was also a decent challenge on the lowest difficulty setting and it goes up to nightmare. The community on Steam and the official Spiderweb website is friendly, helpful and pretty enthusiastic about new people getting into the games AND in case you still aren't sure about the games, Spiderweb offers a free demo which you can upgrade to the full game without having to start a new game. :)\n\n\nP.S.: There are 574 rocks in the game... I may have missed a couple.","January 6","true","83.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At more than 90 hours of gaming on my first playthrough across a vast 2D, isometric, nostalgia-inducing landscape filled with interesting locations peppered with lairs, strongholds, and powerful artifacts that only the most intrepid will discover, Avernum: Escape from the Pit is definitely worth its price of admission. Add to this almost peerless writing and it’s easy to see why I’m regarding this game as one of the best in my collection.\n\nRatings:\n\nTilt: 8.5 – Given that I’ve spent almost 92 hours in this game and finished it, I can say Avernum: Escape from the Pit is something else. I’ve spent several sleepless nights over this one, only quitting when I realized the sun was starting to rise. Spiderweb Software has some topnotch writers.\n\nGameplay: 8.0 – If you’re talking about pure gameplay alone, Avernum suffers from some design choices like making you too powerful near the end of the game and other foibles like recycled sprites and unclickable tiles. Still it does provide a fun romp that even shines head and shoulders from some games that have triple A funding.\n\nGraphics: 6.0 – It’s here that Avernum really suffers. With only a 2D isometric engine, the game really can’t hope to match more recent RPGs like say, The Age of Decadence. Its art style, while very good, is nothing to write home about either; it just doesn’t have anything that makes it stand out from the multitude of RPGs out there in the visuals department.\n\nAudio: 7.5 – Adequate but again, there’s nothing that makes it stand out. If only they made background music as impressive as the one used when the main menu fires up though…\n\nReplayability: 8.5 – This is a pretty divisive point. On one, retro gamers will love replaying this game that lets you relive the good ‘ol days of the 90s. On the other side of the coin, younger gamers may be put off by its visuals and despite its multiple endings, may consider this game a one-shot affair. There’s also the matter of its length: gamers who love protracted adventures blasting hordes of undead and fantastical creatures will find this game up their alley while ones who are easily distracted by new releases might find this one to be a stubborn guest that overstays its welcome. I’m somewhere in the middle but I’m definitely going to unravel its other endings so I’m giving this an 8.5.\n\nScore: 7.7\n\nSee the full review here: http://imbacore.blogspot.com/2015/11/Avernum-Escape-Pit-Review-RPG-Strategy-Turn-Based-Isometric-2D-Classic-Retro.html","November 8, 2015","true","91.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The control system is a little overcomplicated, the graphics are dated, and bosses tend to be signified simply by having disproportionate HP and *gasp* NAMES. Yet even with the remnants of gaming gone by, a natural consequence of the game's age, it's fairly enjoyable on its own merits. The combat is simple but solid, and the environments are decently detailed considering graphical limitations. What really makes the game stand out, though, is the sheer level of personality found in the game's world.\n\n\nThe underground domain of Avernum is a harsh place of limited law. It's interesting to see how its forsaken people react in different ways to their exile: forging new civilizations, forming roving bandit bands making a bad situation worse for everyone, embracing adventure and combat... There's plenty of dialogue and lore to be found during your wandering, a lot of it comedic. For me, more than the game play itself, that's what makes Avernum worth playing: The sense of exploration in a bizarre subterannean kingdom. Give it a look--if you can put up with the eccentricities of age it's nicely done.","April 22, 2014","true","49.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's heavily inspirated by old fashioned isometric rpg from the 90's like Ultima , the nostalgia appeal is definitively there . It's a solid crawling RPG with an appealing world (or rather underworld) if you can stomach the primitive graphics and limited storylines.\n\nGameplaywise Avernum presents us with a good solid and simple fighting system which is quite entertaining and challanging. It's similar to many other similar games but the mechanics work, and it rarely frustrate you depite teh flaws in the GUI or the inperfect pathsystem. The game definitively doesn't hold your hand, and there are areas your party should avoid unntil they've grown in experience and gear as the creatures will crush you mercilessly.\n\nSpiderweb does a good job in presenting us this huge world with unique features and cultures, great atmosphere but ultimately it sometimes feels a little empty and one city look a lot like the others. The game ,with no advanced graphical features to speak of ,tries to impress you with lyric descriptions of the grottos in Avernum, but honestly there are only so many ways to describe the huge , dark and humid  cave where the story takes place, it gets old rather quickly.The quests in this game are rather traditional with the usual fare of defeating bandits\creatures\deamons to save the kingdom\n\nI know Spiderweb do not have the means to pay an army of writers to flesh out dozens of intricate quests with intagrated storyline and unique characters. But a few interesting quests with memorable characters and dramatic events would have been welcomed.\n\nI got rather bored toward the end, maybe because my party had become as good as they could, and the monsters weren't very dangerous and difficult anymore. Or maybe because I was tired of exploring the same fort or grotto with different names over and over again, but to be fair many RPG  have this effect on me after countless hours of playing.\n\nAvernum is a good old game from a different era, it's refreshing especially for its comeback of corevalues of the genre with none of the frivoulous stuff RPGs have to deal with those days (soap opera romances, over the top graphics, boring sidequests).Its biggest strength can also be its biggest weakness however as it also doesn't make much effort to introduce new concepts and stay on the safe side of Nostalgia.\n\nHaving spent well over 100 hours in this game , I can still say it's qualities still outweitgh its flaws by far, what Avernum does , it does it well. If you look for a nice traditional , no-nonsense RPG with a solid gameplay and credible if at times monotonous world , Avernum is exactly it.Its limitations prevent it to be on the same league as Baldur's gate or Divinity (to be fair those are AAA games...) but it's still an excellent game and well worth your time.","August 21, 2015","true","130.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I was disappointed that it wasn't much of an upgrade.  The engine is practically identical, so it just felt like I was replaying Avernum 1 with a couple of usability mods tacked on.  Fortunately, Avernum 1 was an amazing game, so I had almost as much fun replaying it as I did playing it for the first time.  I loved the story, I loved the length, and I loved the challenging turn-based tactical combat which rewards good planning and equipment choice as well as good combat decisions.\n\nLong-time fans of the series will know that there are three versions of this game.  The first, Exile 1, is a non-isometric overhead 2D tactical RPG.  Very fun, but the Avernum remake blew it out of the water.  This remake of Avernum just adds a few "enhancements," some of them desirable and some not.\n\nBETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL AVERNUM:\nNotable locations in towns and dungeons (shops, important NPCs, spellbooks you may want to return to a second time, etc.) are now marked on your map, which helps decrease the copious note-taking this game requires.  Note that you will still have to have some paper beside you (or a text file ready to alt-tab to), to record many places you will want to return to later, or quest details that aren't automatically added to your quest journal.\n\nThere are some additional areas to flesh out the game world, and some additional fun dungeons.\n\nHidden areas now have a visual cue, obviating the need to tediously bump your character against the sides of the maps to find them.\n\nWORSE THAN THE ORIGINAL AVERNUM:\nThe skill and perk system has been overhauled to make it less likely you will unintentionally create a weak character.  I consider this undesirable both because the players who actually need such a feature aren't a good match for a game like this and because much of the fun, flexibility, and personality of the original system has been lost.  Furthermore, I believe that the "problem" being addressed is already covered by the fact that the difficulty can be changed at any time.\n\nSome of the content additions to this version of the game kill the mystery and thrill of the original game.  I can't be more specific without spoiling it for you, but things you really aren't meant to see until you are well into the game, in my opinion, are now accessible to you early on.\n\nThe World Map now autoscrolls instead of letting you explore it one screen at a time, making it both easier to miss things and more annoying to track what you have already explored and what you have left to explore.\n\nAlso, I can't remember if this was in the original version or not, but there is a "soft" level cap at 30, after which you only get a chance to allocate level-up points every five levels (which means level 35, really, since you will probably finish the game before level 40).  Worse, there is NO warning about this!  This can really screw up some of your planning, as many skills require a certain level before the ability you want is available to you.  Of course, this downside won't apply to you, because I just warned you. ;)\n\nTHE VERDICT:\nBoth versions of this game are amazing, so there's no question about my recommending it or not.  So which version should you play?\n\nIf you are a more casual player, worried about making mistakes with your character creation and upon leveling up, get this version.  And if you are not interested in challenging combat, you can also put the difficulty on "Normal" or "Casual," and just enjoy the story.  If you have trouble finding the original and/or getting it to run on your modern computer, you can settle for this version as well--it's not significantly worse.\n\nIf you are a player who cut your teeth on old CRPGs in the 80s and 90s, or if you don't mind dealing with retro conventions, go for the original.  Much of the content you are giving up is not necessarily an improvement to the overall package, and character creation and growth is a LOT more fun.  Just be prepared to take lots of additional notes on the locations of shops and important NPCs in towns.","February 10","true","270.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

For everyone else who would like to give it a chanche, remember that it's a good buy for the price, especially if you succeed in passing over the technical execution that is not to the height of the great productions.","January 24, 2014","true","47.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/raynerderine/recommended/208400/","raynerderine","Clover","http://steamcommunity.com/id/raynerderine/","598 products in account","Great RPG. Unlike the first "generation" of Avernum games, it runs well on new systems, without awful resolution issues, and if you can get past the admitted hideousness, it's great. Personally, I feel graphics are only useful, at least in RPGs, primarily in aiding immersion and secondarily in establishing a mood. Escape from the Pit manages to be quite immersive and have a distinct mood and style despite not really showing you... much of anything. You forget you're actually in an underground cavern sometimes, particularly if there's no cave wall on-screen at the moment, but eh, minor gripes.\n\nIt offers complete freedom and its lack of a real "main quest" is just fantastic. There's three biggest, longest questlines you can happen upon, the most obvious one being to escape back to the surface, but when and if you go about them is up to you.\n\nIf you're looking for negatives, perhaps the fact that everything is very scripted, with no real emergent gameplay or narrative might sadden you a bit, especially as it means there's really zero replay value... once you do everything. But there is a bunch of content and things to do. It's a huge world with lots of stuff. So that'll take some time. I'd have guessed I completed well over 90% of it and it took me 40-odd hours. Then I did a second playthrough and found more.\n\nAlso in its favor is its lack of classes. It's skill-based, and you get plenty of them, so you've lots of room to experiment. And the combat is tactical and far deeper than many turn-based RPGs. It's certainly not its selling point, but you don't get bored.\n\nWell worth your money.","February 28, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I bought it during the Christmas Sale on Steam along with everything else Spiderweb had out and decided to start with this title because it had achievements.  I was hooked on the first day.  Three hundred hours later I now have all the characters maxed out, all the endings and achievements and still a craving to play more from Spiderweb.\n\nAvernum began as Exile back in 1995.  The series has six core titles, making two trilogies in the underworld setting.  The game was then re-released as Avernum in 2000. In 2011, the game was then redesigned for tablets with the Avadon engine and giving a rewritten script. Escape from the Pit is this title and it was announced that the other two games of the first trilogy would be receiving a rewrite and re-release as well to build a more concise and cohesive story for the trilogy.\n\nAn evil and despotic emperor rules the entire world above, throwing all dissidents into the pit.  He's rather ruthless about it too.  I was waiting to find the guy who was thrown down in the pit for farting in front of the emperor.  Avernum is a land underground with miles of caverns where humans create societies and come at odds with the other inhabitants of the dark land. It's really impressive to see the depth of character development and the interweaving plots that are made for this game. Kudos to Spiderweb for this.\n\nAvernum isn't for everybody though.  The graphics are outdated, the music is bland, and the story really takes forever to get going.\nRegardless, I shut the music off and I was fine. I still love this style of graphics personally, and once you do get to the endgame you really feel for the protagonists, cheering for them and really getting into the dialogue.  Grah-Hoth gave me goosebumps and made me feel real dread. Escaping made me feel relieved, and defeating the emperor was exhilarating.\n\nBesides this, I really don't have much else to say about the game.  Spiderweb Software is a company of three guys making games.  I respect them for this and back in college it was a once a dream of mine and two of my friends to do just this.  For them its a way to tell a story and feed their families at the same time.  I recommend anyone who enjoys this style of RPG to give Spiderweb Games a try.  They're a great deal on Steam.","April 22, 2014","true","281.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It reminds me of the old "Pool of Radiance," and similar type games, which came out in the 1980's. But, it isn't the same, as in, it isn't "official DnD rules," in fact it is more like a GURPS type system, where each character can be built any way you want. For example, you can have a "tank" type character who can also cast healing spells, or a wizard who is also skilled with a bow.\n\nI was skeptical at first, having been burned several times by games which are no fun at all. But, I am a huge fan of turn based RPG's, which are well made. This is one of them. I can't wait to try Avernum 2, 4, 5 and 6, which are also on Steam. (strangely, there is no Avernum 3 on Steam).\n\nThe fights can be challenging. There have been several in which I thought the entire party would die, but I ended up victorious (my four man party has two healers, one of which is sort of an archer/healer, but it works well to have a back-up healer. I also put one point on healing for my mage, so he can also heal with his huge mana pool if he has to). And my party has been wiped out several times, but the game allows frequent saves, so all you need to do is go back to your last saved game and you're good to go if they all die.\n\nThe game allows you to "level up," with stat and ability increases at each level. There seems to be no level limit. I have been playing the game for a few days and my party is already level eleven.\n\nTreasure includes things like better armor, weapons, scrolls, wands, potions, money, gems, and all sorts of mundane things, like bags of flour, tools, etc.","July 3, 2015","true","74.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This remake uses a modified version of the engine from Avadon: The Black Fortress, and not only has better compatibility with newer computers, but also is improved in the way of graphics and usability.\n\nI'm not going to talk much about the graphics. Since this is a SpiderWeb Software game, there isn't going to be much in the way of spectacular graphical effects. Everything is in 2D, but the art has a charm to it that lends itself to the genre.\n\nThe lore and story of Avernum is what makes the game great. The game takes place in an unnamed fantasy world ruled by 'The Empire', led by the ruthless Emperor Hathorn. Hathorn crushes any resistance by banishing unlucky souls into an expansive unground cavern system known only as Avernum. Crimes as petty as vocalized discontent is enough to earn a one way trip to Avernum. The enterance is a one way portal underground, and there is no way out (?).\n\nYou take control of a band of 4 adventurers, each guilty of unspecified crimes against the crown. Upon arrival in Avernum, you learn that despite the harsh conditions of the realm, Avernum has developed its own society, with its own towns, culture, and government. All is not well, however, as the underground Kingdom is locked in a constant state of warfare with the other races that inhabit the caves. The lizardlike Slitherazki, the catlike Nepharim, and the rebels and bandits who disassociate themselves with King Micah's state all try to break down the fragile thread that holds Avernum together.\n\nOnce allowed to roam Avernum, your adventurers might find themselves without direction. The world is open, with few prohibitive roadblocks to stop any exploration of the caves you might find yourself wanting to do. The dangers of the southern and western caves will keep you away until you've gained more experience living in the caves. There are three ways to 'win' the game, each of which will reveal itself to you as you gain fame with the people of the cities.\n\n1) Banish the demon lord Grah-Hoth\n2) Exterminate the Emperor Hathorn\n3) FInd a way to escape the tunnels\n\nThese are all lofty goals, and completing smaller tasks to gain strength is a must.\n\n","May 26, 2014","true","47.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The inhabitants of Avernum (and boy, there are a lot of them) are a strange and varied lot which help breathe life into the otherwise bare-bones aesthetic of the game.  Not to mention all the various bits of lore and worldbuilding detail that make Avernum feel both unique and immediately familiar to any avid RPG player.\n\nThe combat is pretty basic turn-based strategy.  Buffs, proper equipment, a clever distribution of potions/scrolls/wands, and tactical unit placement are all essential to victory.  The character/party building system is not particularly deep and the number and variety of spells are a little underwhelming, but there's still plenty of room for experiementation.\n\nMy only real complaint about the, game besides the sometimes frustrating UI, is the disaapointingly small variety of weapons and armor.  The only melee weapons available are swords (short, long, broad), daggers, and spears/halberds - it's never mentioned why for some reason Avernum blacksmiths are unable to make maces, flails, warhammers, axes, or any of the other medieval weaponry common to the genre - a similar issue with armor, there's only leather, iron, and steel.  I assume it has to do with the original game's limitations, or possible deadline issues (Jeff seems to always be working on something), as adding new weapon classes would mean adding new skill trees which would require a lot more balancing and playtesting.  It's understandable, if not a little disappointing, but maybe I'm asking too much of a remake of a remake of a 20 year old game.  That said, the game is completely littered with various pieces of enchanted equipment which at the very least helps alleviate some of that disappointment.\n\nAll-in-all, I whole-heartedly reccomend this to any fans of classic cRPGs like Ultima/Fallout/Baldur's Gate, as well as fans of tactical JRPGs a la FF:Tactics.  It's  real good stuff.","August 19, 2015","true","90.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The inhabitants of Avernum (and boy, there are a lot of them) are a strange and varied lot which help breathe life into the otherwise bare-bones aesthetic of the game.  Not to mention all the various bits of lore and worldbuilding detail that make Avernum feel both unique and immediately familiar to any avid RPG player.\n\nThe combat is pretty basic turn-based strategy.  Buffs, proper equipment, a clever distribution of potions/scrolls/wands, and tactical unit placement are all essential to victory.  The character/party building system is not particularly deep and the number and variety of spells are a little underwhelming, but there's still plenty of room for experiementation.\n\nMy only real complaint about the, game besides the sometimes frustrating UI, is the disaapointingly small variety of weapons and armor.  The only melee weapons available are swords (short, long, broad), daggers, and spears/halberds - it's never mentioned why for some reason Avernum blacksmiths are unable to make maces, flails, warhammers, axes, or any of the other medieval weaponry common to the genre - a similar issue with armor, there's only leather, iron, and steel.  I assume it has to do with the original game's limitations, or possible deadline issues (Jeff seems to always be working on something), as adding new weapon classes would mean adding new skill trees which would require a lot more balancing and playtesting.  It's understandable, if not a little disappointing, but maybe I'm asking too much of a remake of a remake of a 20 year old game.  That said, the game is completely littered with various pieces of enchanted equipment which at the very least helps alleviate some of that disappointment.\n\nAll-in-all, I whole-heartedly reccomend this to any fans of classic cRPGs like Ultima/Fallout/Baldur's Gate, as well as fans of tactical JRPGs a la FF:Tactics.  It's  real good stuff.","August 19, 2015","true","90.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/208400/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","Made by the same people who did Avadon: The Black Fortress, this game shares much of the same engine and game resources while being a much more enjoyable title.  The story is much less scripted; your party of four generics is exiled to an underground Australia for defying or upsetting the powers that be, and the setting actually focuses a lot on cave life and does it pretty well.  The semi-open world lets you explore and adventure and kills things for loot, levels, and story progress.  Unlike Avadon, the scripted 'find a way to escape' goal is present in the story itself rather than spoiled and given away at the start.  There's optional fetchquesting and more interesting sidequesting, and a fair share of nice unique loot too which is always a plus in my book.  There is enough optional combat and XP to make the game non-challenging at a certain point, which is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nThe downsides are still numerous though.  There's a lot of RPG min-maxing and information invisible to the player, such as one skill specifying a fatigue reduction bonus in number (5%) per skill point but another merely saying it 'improves fatigue reduction' without saying by how much.  Two-handed weapons do not do more damage for taking up an extra hand and there are so few unique polearms in the game as to make polearms basically worse than sword-and-board or dual-wielding.  Archery is a completely useless skill having literally one unqiue weaponto its name, and there is no reason to not give everyone a single point in priest magic and completely eschew the First Aid skill since 'fighter' skills do not use MP.  Pathfinding is pretty annoying at times because the game does not want to path through allies, path too far, through doors, or falsely tells you a space is blocked.  A lot of abilities are not worth using because they inflict debuffs which have an insignificant impact compared to raw DPS abilities.  The sound design is basically zero.  There is music at the title and credits only, and a lot of ambient noise is lackluster.  Combat sounds are generic and unimpressive.  Aside from at least one charming moment with talking spiders, none of the characters have interesting personalities which is kind of a let down.\n\nSo all in all, I'd say the following: The game is passable in combat and character progression (as long as you are good at understanding RPGs) and does please for those interested in gathering cool stuff to equip.  The game has a more open story progression, even if unimpressively delivered by its character writing and sound.  The setting is very unique and interesting, and definately a strong point of the game.  At 70hrs long on normal difficulty (I probably idled some of those hours) it provides a good amount of content and I did enjoy myself throughout.  I would not reccomend it to someone looking for a core game or an RPG dabbler but otherwise I think its fine.","April 15, 2014","true","70.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Games are more accessible, fun and a lot easier to navigate. However, there are a lot of players and developers who cherish, if that’s the proper term, that old school look and feel. Avernum Escape from the Pit does not disappoint those fans. Its old school in every way from its look, broken mathematics, terrible inventory management, and world navigation. What is painful are these are all minor and fixable flaws that take away the strengths and add dozens upon dozens of unnecessary hours to the game and ultimately ruins your experience.\n\nAvernum Escape from the Pit is an isometric party RPG that from my understanding is a remake of an earlier Spiderweb title, Avernum 6. The story begins with you and 3 other characters that are tossed into the underground world of Avernum for crimes unknown against the empire. Your main objective is to escape, but other game ending objectives become available later in the game. The story, writing and quests design border on excellent and are easily the highlight for your long adventure.\n\nAvernum is built on a very recognizable RPG level up system with points which are distributed through common statistics, skill and traits trees. As I said earlier the mathematics in the game are broken in such a way a character editor is attached so you can basically max out a character from the start. I did not use the editor until the end where I just had had enough. My party consisted of a tank (sword/shield), tank (pole weapons), Mage (archer), and priest (Archer). I would be confident in any RPG that this party is common and can succeed, but after many failures near the end and reading forum posts, specific character builds, not recommended, are it seems required in order to successfully finish the game. That is unacceptable but makes sense why an editor is attched.\n\nBattles in Avernum are turn based in which the true pain is highlighted. At the onset you will be highly overwhelmed in such a way enemies will hit what feels like 100% of the time while your main characters, no matter how you have them built, will be lucky to hit at 45%. I must have uninstalled and reinstalled the game half a dozen times it is so infuriating. What’s weird is around level 12 you start to feel somewhat capable, but then it all comes crashing back down around level 21. The inconsistences grow as you continue to get deeper in the game. If you are in a dungeon you at least have a fighting chance but out in the open where you can get surrounded, luck, potions, and a healthy healer is your only salvation. As a side note I started the game on hard difficulty as I do with all games, but seeing those statistics and constant early failures I dropped down to normal. I would like to say it made a difference, but not much.\n\nI spent over 100 hours in Avernum and I can’t think of a game that has made me more frustrated. Its complete broken character builds, mathematics and reliance to remain ‘old-school’ doesn’t help build an audience but keeps them away. Until I hear Spiderweb, who just celebrated 20 years in the business, address some modern design into their games, I’ll look elsewhere to spend my RPG time.\n\nPositives\n*The world, story and writing are very good. It’s very reminiscent of Edgar Allen Poeish in the description of places and people.\n*Quest design is excellent.\n*Great couch/ Laptop game never used a mouse.\n\nNegatives\n*Reliance on keeping old school mentality dooms the ability to grow an audience\n*If you release a character editor chances are the mathematics from your character builds, to enemy AI is broken.\n*No fast travel. There is some minor fast travel but I still figure 20+ hours is running around from place to place. Especially when trying to figure out a quest. The absolute #1 thing that needs implemented.\n*Shops don’t replenish goods. One of the most, if not most important potions, is frenzy where it increases your AP for a number of rounds. Because of the size of the world and number of quests, if you use them during some minor battles, when you get to the dragon fights or bosses at the end good luck if you are out.\n*Inventory as it has no effect for weight, unless worn, should be shared and have a sort button.\n*The loot is very weak. Because this is a dungeon crawler in 2015(released last year) loot should be awesome and your character should mirror that aesthetic, not remain static.\n*Because of the graphical fidelity sometimes loot is hard to see on the screen. An added button to highlight interactive objects would fix this problem. It didn’t bother me, but I know others have complained of the static camera.\n*A hit chance of 95% cannot =70%\n*Why are there not hidden passages at the end of a dungeon to go straight to the exit or at least a short cut?\n*Speech options remain even if you have used them\n*One of your main Mage and Priest abilities is to conjure a minion. They are completing useless and are nothing more than a distraction to enemies.\n","February 15, 2015","false","119.1"," 11 of 25 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","11","25","2","0"

I have played Suikoden I and II from start to finish, Tactics Ogre, Suikoden Tactics, and Final Fantasy Tactics 3 times, plus both GBA games and the PSP remake as well. Not to mention Civilizations I-V. I LOVE turn-based strategy, in all of its forms.\n\nOr so I thought.\n\nThis game is a member of a disturbingly expansive group of titles I like to call Keep Away Games. Remember the old childhood game keep away, where the whole point was to keep a certain person from getting a certain item they really wanted? This is similar, in that the fun is always kept JUUUUUUST outside your grasp. Ok, that's not true. Sometimes it flies so far over your head that the Sun blinds you, and you lose track of it completely.\n\n-Just when you're enjoying exploring the overworld, your characters get stuck because you're trying to click on the square next to you, but the game thinks you're clicking on you. Teeth starting to grate, CHECK.\n-Just when you're enjoying combat, you click to move 2 squares away, and the idiotic AI decides you meant you want to take 4 turns walking completely around the level, taking the absolute most circuitous route possible to get to your destination, rather than move TWO FREAKING STEPS IN THE OTHER DIRECTION. Bonus points if this idiocy costs you a battle. Prepare for lots of bonus points. Swearing at computer in multiple languages, CHECK CHECK.\n-Just when you've gotten a few dozen rounds of combat down and are feeling good about things, you hit a battle so ridiculously tough (in the same exact area you've been cleaning up) that you have to quicksave and quickload 3 dozen times, hoping to get an outcome where your entire party isn't stunned at the same time for the 3rd turn in a row again. Clicking on "Delete Local Content," oh 10 minutes ago called to give you your CHECK.\n\nI would like to meet the person whose idea of fun is fighting 3 enemies, each of which can stun your entire group at once and summon other monsters to help, which each take 4-5 turns of your team's entire concentrated effort to kill, so that I can tattoo across their forehead in Helvetica bold "FAULTY GENETIC CODE. DO NOT SLEEP WITH."\n\nControls are hideous as well. You can control the whole game via keyboard, and absolutely 165% should, but even that isn't well fleshed out. Hitting I opens up the inventory, of course, but DON'T hit I again. You have to hit ESC to close the menu. Hitting I again may accidentally use the item in your inventory to which the I key got arbitrarily assigned to. Small things like that really don't make that big of a difference, but they certainly don't help a game that already left a sour taste in my mouth.\n\nGames like this actually make me angry, because they have the potential to be SO. AWESOME. Idiotic controls, horrifically moronic AI, COMPLETE lack of direction, and stupefying difficulty spikes aside, you may enjoy this...\n\n...if you're trapped on a desert island, or don't have enough money to afford aaaaaaaaanything else.","February 16, 2013","true","6.4"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

Your characters zip around at lightning speed, both in combat and outside it. The combat speed of the game is equally fast. Damage numbers, state changes, attacks, everything: it all goes so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on. For example, I couldn't tell which enemies my spells were working on, and which ones resisted it. There is no setting for game speed, so this is game-breaking.\n\nSecondly, the graphics suck. You can't tell what something looks like and it destroys the immersion. Honestly, this game has worse graphics than Fallout 1. The spell amimations and special affects are awful as well.\n\nThird, the controls are really clunky. You can't pass a turn. You can't select a character by clicking on them, you have to use the portraits. The inventory system and the way you pick up items is really wierd. Instead of having nice, neat action bars with abilities on it like every other turn-based rpg, you have to open menus in the middle of combat. It's so tedious. You can tell that very little thought or common sense went into the design choices.\n\nFourth, the character developement and skill system is super streamlined. For example, there are only about 20 wizard spells and 20 priest spells in the entire game. And on top of that, you don't choose them. You unlock a specific spell everytime you gain a skill level in casting. The progression is about as linear as you can get. Oh, and rogues can't sneak or pickpocket for some reason. That's like one of the most basic aspects of RPG's! There are also no speech skills, so it looks like this game is 100% combat without any alternatives. Having multiple options, such as stealth or persuation, is one of the main pillars of RPG games and this game totally skips it.\n\nTL;DR\n-too fast\n-awful graphics\n-clunky controls\n-character development is about as simplified as possible.","January 22, 2015","false","0.7"," 6 of 23 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","6","23","0","1"

Don't just look at the graphics and think it's cheap and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - the developer Jeff Vogel has been building this world for years, creating a detailed fantasy setting and deep plot. You have a lot of freedom in character choice and progression, though this potentially lets you cripple your party by ignoring balance and picking all sorcerers. (Don't pick all sorcerers. That's hardmode.)\n\nMy favourite part of this game is not being told how tough an enemy encounter is going to be. You might wipe the floor with those giant lizards using a single Call the Storm spell. Or you might get dazed, ensnared, and burned to a crisp by exploding slimes. The fun part is picking up from your most recent autosave, assessing where you went wrong, trying something different, and coming out on top with another strategy. (Tip: trigger fights and then retreat to a bottleneck, if possible. Don't underestimate upgraded spells, either.)\n\nThe clumsiest part of the game is the interface, which harks back to more than a decade ago, and has some annoying quirks. Can't alt-tab on Mac? Pathfinding range is limited and automatically enters dungeons if they're in the way? Isometric layout makes it difficult to click enemies in the square above you? Some of this stuff seems so obvious that it makes me think Jeff's decided it would take too much time to chip off all the rough edges, but you have to admire his dedication to making games *for a living* which means *to a budget*.\n\n(Edit: it doesn't look like I have many hours in this game, but that's because I mostly play offline on my laptop while commuting. I estimate I've spent at least twenty on it at this point - and dozens more in Jeff's earlier "Exile" series during the mid 90s.)","August 19, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, I can't be sure that the creator of the game is at all familiar with Earthdawn, but the setting definitely has feels of both the post-apocalyptic-ness of Fallout, and the special flavor of the fantasy rpg Earthdawn.\n\nThe gist: You did something. The Empire was displeased enough to want you out of the Empire permanently. But, rather than bloody executions that are bad for morale, they sent you... elsewhere. The caverns of Avernum, where you are to live out the rest of your hopefully-short life. Of course, this being an RPG, you have other ideas and other options.\n\nThe game world is vast, with a world map spanning numerous screens in every direction, nearly innumerable dungeons, cities, and other places to explore. Three Major Quests, and numerous lesser ones (including, of course, the fetch quests. Where would we be without pointless fetch quests that, thankfully, you can ignore if you want to).\n\nThe system is solid: There is a great deal of customizability with your characters. You make a party of four, either from pre-gen characters or making them up from scratch from a mixture of attributes, 'feats', and skills, of which you gain more with every level-up. Sword-mage? Can do. Warrior Priest? Sure. Team of archer-priests? If that's how you want to roll it, sure. Some builds will be better than others, obviously, but especially on the normal and easy modes, you can build how you please and still make it through the game.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are not modern-quality. This is an indie game, and it shows. If you want a game that has cutscenes to ooh over, or wonderful soundtracks to slay beasts by, look elsewhere. (This isn't a slight on either the people who will look elsewhere or on the game, by the by. If you want a more visceral experience, by all means find a game that suits your wants more.) What this game does provide, however, is a lot of story. While your character is very much the anybody, allowing you to project yourself seamlessly without a pre-made backstory getting in the way, that means that all of the backstory is the setting's. NPCs there are many of. Random passersby in the towns often have their own things to say. While the atmosphere generated by the graphics engine is often lacking, entering a new place often will give you a long description instead.\n\nIn short: It's a solid indie RPG for people who like reading.\nAvernum 2 and 3 presently are only available in a non-Steam even-lower-graphics-quality version, but I've heard the developer is planning on upgrading them in the near future.","September 1, 2014","true","81.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It will take a bit of trial and error to figure out exactly where you're strong enough to wander, at least at first.

The world feels real despite not being first or third person, couple that with cool battles, spells, enemies, skills, and of course, sweet loot, makes Avernum quite a good series.\n\nIf you've never liked RPGs or games of this top down turn based genre before, however, this will not change your mind.","April 11, 2012","true","75.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't just look at the graphics and think it's cheap and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - the developer Jeff Vogel has been building this world for years, creating a detailed fantasy setting and deep plot. You have a lot of freedom in character choice and progression, though this potentially lets you cripple your party by ignoring balance and picking all sorcerers. (Don't pick all sorcerers. That's hardmode.)\n\nMy favourite part of this game is not being told how tough an enemy encounter is going to be. You might wipe the floor with those giant lizards using a single Call the Storm spell. Or you might get dazed, ensnared, and burned to a crisp by exploding slimes. The fun part is picking up from your most recent autosave, assessing where you went wrong, trying something different, and coming out on top with another strategy. (Tip: trigger fights and then retreat to a bottleneck, if possible. Don't underestimate upgraded spells, either.)\n\nThe clumsiest part of the game is the interface, which harks back to more than a decade ago, and has some annoying quirks. Can't alt-tab on Mac? Pathfinding range is limited and automatically enters dungeons if they're in the way? Isometric layout makes it difficult to click enemies in the square above you? Some of this stuff seems so obvious that it makes me think Jeff's decided it would take too much time to chip off all the rough edges, but you have to admire his dedication to making games *for a living* which means *to a budget*.\n\n(Edit: it doesn't look like I have many hours in this game, but that's because I mostly play offline on my laptop while commuting. I estimate I've spent at least twenty on it at this point - and dozens more in Jeff's earlier "Exile" series during the mid 90s.)","August 19, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is the closest I've felt to D&D on the computer as far as storytelling and exploration. The world is huge but contained enough to navigate around. The graphics are pretty minimalist but with the exception of the skill tree seem to fit the story and the mechanics of the game. Fantastic balancing of the items. There wasn't really a "best" of anything but rather trade offs for most of the magical items. I've been looking for a good isometric squad based fantasy game since playing Wasteland 2 and this is the best I've found so far. Enormous amount of text and story with lots of side quests and nooks and crannies waiting to be discovered. On the down side the game lacked a lot of depth. Most characters are superficially shallow serving mostly for plot device with no real attachment to or from the player. The battle sequences can also become grinding if you don't build your party correctly. You're able to get through it but it will take you forever. I clocked my first play through at 86 hours.

Avernum: Escape from the pit is an Ultima style isometric turn-based RPG with unique skills and magic set into richly detailed fairly unique world with awesome, engaging writing and meticulously detaild maps. Narration and dialogues are the highlight, cause the game is old-school as it gets. No grim-brown realystic 3d graphic, no CGI cutscenes, but lovely prose with lots of charm and wit. Open ended world is one of the highlights. In theory you cn traverse the whole map, or at least most of it from the get-go, but areas do have unstated level requirement and you'll be quickly slaughtered if you go to the harder area than you'r level alows. Every city map is full of details, secret passages and metroid-esque still unreachable places, so don't expect to be 100% through with even the most basic of dungeons or cities up till the very end. Level progression is smooth and T-B combad is addictive in that ancient pokemon/Xcom/Fallout1&2 kind of way.\nSo all in all, not to stretch this for too long, I'd warmly recommend the game for anyone wanting nice, solid T-B WRPG.","October 14, 2013","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I remember writing a check and MAILING it in to the developer's address.  And then I was mailed back the codes.  In an envelope.\n\nSigh... it was so much niver to get that rather than the crdit card offers and bills that I get today.\n\nGraphically I have to admit that the Exile series hasn't evolved a whole lot, particularly compared to other modern games.  But what has thankfully remained the same is everything else about the Exile series: the gameplay and plotlines.\n\nAt its heart this is a turn-based RPG, though with much more freedom to explore and build your characters than most other RPGs on the market.  Want to build a mage who also enjoys wielding a sword?  Yes you can do that.  Or a barbarian who dabbles in archery?  You can do that too.\n\nEnemies and environments are varied enough to make the game interesting.  There are fairly few recolored enemies, and each town is distinct enough that they have their own personality and such.\n\nIt is easy to get lost in the cavernous world of Avernum, but I suppose that is part of the setting.\n\nOverall well worth at least $8 in my book, and is usually much less expensive than that!","November 28, 2013","true","117.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not visually stimulating, but well-written for the most part, with some solid gameplay mechanics and some interesting and convenient ideas of its own.  Has a few annoying puzzle gimmicks that it will throw at you more than once, and puzzles are not exceptionally clever.  Still, the game was very good and very long for the cost.\n\nI'd say my only real complaint is the utter lack of a musical soundtrack.  I guess that was for ambiance?  It works alright, for the most part, but I think the game could have been much improved with a decent background soundtrack.\n\nBe warned, the game does not always provide you with a lot of direction, and is merciless if you happen to wander into an area that is too strong for you.  It will take a bit of trial and error to figure out exactly where you're strong enough to wander, at least at first.

This is actually a decent 2D story-driven exploration RPG in the vein of Ultima. The story (or at least setting) is original, which makes it stand out enough that I played it a lot longer than Avadon (another recent Spiderweb RPG) before getting distracted by other games.\n\nMy only complaint is that the author doesn't know to put a one millisecond sleep call in his main game loops, so be prepared for having one of your CPU cores pegged at 100% usage while playing (which is especially frustrating on laptops, where power usage and heat dissipation / fan noise are concerns).

The graphics are pretty minimalist but with the exception of the skill tree seem to fit the story and the mechanics of the game. Fantastic balancing of the items. There wasn't really a "best" of anything but rather trade offs for most of the magical items. I've been looking for a good isometric squad based fantasy game since playing Wasteland 2 and this is the best I've found so far. Enormous amount of text and story with lots of side quests and nooks and crannies waiting to be discovered. On the down side the game lacked a lot of depth. Most characters are superficially shallow serving mostly for plot device with no real attachment to or from the player. The battle sequences can also become grinding if you don't build your party correctly. You're able to get through it but it will take you forever. I clocked my first play through at 86 hours.

It was... well, huge doesn't even begin to describe it. Back then, I didn't know a single english word, but I still played that game (the shareware part, at least) for WEEKS. It took days to even notice that there were shareware restrictions, and then I just started a new game... and it was completely different. The world of Exile 3 was so huge, and there was so much to do, it was practically impossible to play the same story twice. A single decision could change everything.\n\nI miss that. Yes, Avernum has sideplots - important sideplots even. Your decision also influence the story in noticeable ways. Still, compared to Exile 3, where half the sidequests seemed to be at least as important and satisfying as the main quests, Avernum is slightly lacking in diversity.\n\nAll of that aside, it's still a great game. The developers of Spiderweb Software have once more (re-)created a huge world, an epic storyweb (I simply refuse to call the complex plot of any of their games a simple storyLINE), many complex and believable characters... and made all of it work with, not despite, limited resources.\n\nMy recommendation therefore remains: If you like to get completely lost in a game, if you're looking for a captivating story, If you want to truly identify with the characters of a game, and if all of that is more important to you than fancy graphics and the +12 Sword of <insert fancy name here>, then there's nothing better than a Spiderweb game.

(It was close to 30; I'm not going to bother looking it up.) I was very poor then, and couldn't afford to pay to unlock it, so I just played the trial content repeatedly. The gameplay was that engaging that I didn't really need the storyline, but oh, how I wanted it.\n\nNow, here it is, the full story, with the incredible turn-based tactical battle system that I remember, and even better graphics than the original. (Dated, perhaps, but I like retro.) Avernum presents a world where your choices matter, and there are a lot of them to make. Character development is flexible, and you're presented with difficult trade-offs to meet competing priorities. The possibilities to make up your party of four are practically infinite, giving the game a lot of replay value as well.\n\nIf you like games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Suikoden Tactics for the battle systems, this is definitely worth your attention.","March 23, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am pretty addicted to old school computer rpgs. I must admit when I saw this remake of a remake i didnt have too high of hopes. Boy was i wrong, this game sucked me in from the very start and i cant wait to do another playthru to do some of the smaller quests and try and take my luck at other pary comps.\n\nAbsolute must buy when the avernum set is on sale\n\nGraphics 7/10 lets just be real youre not buying this game for the graphics. They are very simple but get the job done.\n\nStory 9/10 You quickly realize that this game has huge depth. There are so many locations and areas way across the map that tie into each other.\n\nBattle System 9/10 The battle system is actually pretty simple but is very addicting and requires some decent strategy for harder battles. Only real complaint is that sometimes it is a pain in the ♥♥♥ to select a gride close to enemies if that enemy in question is larger and blocks that grid.\n\nLeveling and skill tree 8/10 The leveling and skills system is pretty basic but has just enough depth to allow some pretty decent character development. The system uses a 3 pronged system which isnt too bad. Provided me with some interesting character combos that i liked.\n\nOverall 9/10 With the combination of the outstanding setting and story with a good battle system and decent character custimization Avernum Escape From the Pit will provide you with many hours of excitement.","March 17","true","84.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Choose from a handful of stock avatars.  Doesn't detract from the game, but doesn't stand out either.\n-Graphics - Same as the character customization, the graphics work, but feel rather dated.  At times, the art gives me the distinct feel of a late 90's PC RPG.\n\nCons:\n-At times, it can be easy to get lost when looking for new locations, even with the help of a questline.  While this can sometimes lead to good things, like finding secret areas, more often than not it has caused me to wander into areas above my level, causing me to die or run away screaming.  This is subjective of course, as I may also have poor sense of direction lol.\n-When learning to play the game, you really need to pay attention to what strategies work in combat, or you'll find yourself in frustrating situations.  In the beginning, almost any strategy works, misleading you into thinking your current strategies are good enough.  In reality, I found myself being forced to reroll a new game a couple times just to try some different approaches to combat.  New starting skills to aid in my survivability and varying methods of damage output, to fight tough enemies like mages that like to disable half (or more) of your team in a single shot.\n(Honestly, I'm not sure if this is a Con or a Pro, as it really makes you think and adds to the strategy any RPG.  But it can be frustrating all the same, having to restart because your current builds can't counter something.  Casual gamers and those new to this type of game, may have trouble with this.)\n\nSummary:\nAwesome game.  Plays a lot like older and newer turn based RPGs, like Divinity:OS or perhaps Fallout Tactics:BoS.  Sure to be enjoyed by anyone that's a fan of turnbased isometric RPGs.","December 27, 2015","true","41.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/recommended/208400/","gamerlen","GamerLEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerlen/","325 products in account","So, I got this game a while back but put it to the side for a while because I had other flashier games that were calling for my attention.\n\nAfter a while I wound up bored while doing work study at my local college and finding out it was more workSTUDY with a severe lack of enough study to keep me busy, so I was compiling a list of all the titles my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Toshiba laptop could run and this one came up.\n\nToday I killed the leader of the lizardfolk that were threatening the lives of the humans of Avernum, explored the Abyss, discovered the return of a demonic overlord, plunged into a crypt, reforged the legendary sword 'Demonsbane' and after all that paused finally to say "wait, what ♥♥♥♥ing time is it?".\n\nAs Ben 'Yahtzee' Croshaw once said there are two types of games. Games I've stopped playing because I'm approaching a state of boredom akin to rigor mortis and games I've stopped playing because I just realized I should have had dinner two hours ago. This one is officially the latter.\n\nDon't let the 'this thing was cutting edge when the SNES was still big news' appearance scare you off. If you let yourself get drawn into it you'll find a surprisingly deep game with some really well-written dialogue, funny characters, some genuine excitement, and loads of exploration. I honestly laughed out loud when I found the Spider village, where all the sentient spiders live who are very friendly, talk like small children, and are all named Spider. It was both cute and pretty damn weird.\n\nSo yes, if you an old RPG fan like me this game is definitely worth a look, as are Spiderweb's other titles. Sadly Geneforge seems to ♥♥♥♥ up on my computer, probably Windows 10, but the Avernum games are top notch for those who want something that feels more like a classic game or whose computers can't handle big stodgy titles like Fallout 4.\n\nhttp://lenwolfgamer.tumblr.com/post/143063355587/avernum-escape-from-the-pit","April 6","true","20.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
