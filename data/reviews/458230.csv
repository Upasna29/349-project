It's not flashy.  Theres no story.  It's full of dumb jokes and laughable "Characters".\n\nBut after an hour of play; it's got tight controls (Didn't find a way to remap, but honestly, I was too busy playing the game to really look), an easy to navigate UI, easy to understand but difficult to master AI, and the upgrade/ship system adds something I've never really experianced before in the genre.  The soundtrack is pretty sweet, too, and I wish I could get it as a DLC (In Lossless format, please).\n\nIn short; it's a diamond in the rough.  Even at full price ($1.99 at the time of this review), it's worth the coin and I got it on sale.  I've paid a lot more for a lot less.  Fans of the genre; get this. It's not perfect, but it IS enjoyable.","April 21","true","1.6"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

Infinite Shooter is underwhelming: few sound effects, little music, amateurish artwork, barebones menus.  Plenty of other options that pack more of a punch than this game does.","May 30","false","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
