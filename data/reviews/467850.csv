Most of my problems come from the game being D-Pad exclusive, making it a pain to play on an Xbox 360 controller. The backgrounds are actually decently detailed, and the character sprites are pretty great. The game runs really well at a solid 60 fps, which is impressive for what seems to be this developer's first project.\n\nI do think the text needs better translation though, and a dash button should be added as well, or change the button combonation to make it go. But seeing how the developer is actually taking into consideration feedback to improve the game down the line, rather than leaving it in its average state shows the dedication from them to make an actually solid game.","May 22","true","1.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Not thrilled with what happened on Mighty No. 9?\n\nThen I've got a deal for you, my friends.\n\nThis is Metagal, from freshman developer RetroRevolution. They're an Indian developer that decided that rather than tackle an MMO,  they were going to do a thing, do it well, and move on. As a result, they've delivered on what they claimed: A game that looks a bit like Megaman, plays a lot like Megaman, and still does its own thing in its own peculiar way.\n\nRight down to the nasty case of Nintendo Hard it seems to have picked up from the original Megaman games. Sitting down to play this game made me feel like a teenager again-- all the way down to the Epic Fail getting much of anywhere.\n\nFor upsides, there's a fair list-- Hardcore Megaman/Metroidvania players will love the vertical difficulty curve (it's not playing around here) post-tutorial, solid look and gameplay, and a bad habit of killing you if you stop to think things through.\n\nAs for the cons, I only have two complaints: a very small native resolution and a bit of slop in the controls. The first is correctable with the maximize button (no fullscreen) and antialiasing, while the second might just be me. Your mileage may vary.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/sL1E9iT375U\n\nEDIT: It's come to my attention that there's a spot in the Tutorial that caused a drop through the scenery for some users. I did not see it, and haven't been able to duplicate it.","May 22","true","0.4"," 19 of 33 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","19","33","0","0"

Like Legend of Dark Witch (another highly recommended Mega Man-like Run n' Gun for super cheap) this is a basically a gender swapped Mega Man. It's a retro-style run n' gun platformer pitting your mechanized heroine against a bunch of Android "Gals" vs. Mega Man's various dude Robot Masters (excluding MM9's Splash Woman).  Unlike Dark Witch, which adds in it's own ideas (like a Gradius style upgrade bar) this one sticks to the MM formula pretty much exclusively. But it does pretty well!\n\nVisually it looks fantastic; the pixel art here and the color palette used is as good as, or better than, genuine SNES/Genesis/Amiga quality. The chibi character art really evoke cute, Japanese sidescrollers from the era. The quality of the chiptunes is great too. Controls are absolutely on point. They're super responsive and tight; it feels great with a 360 controller. The levels are very well designed, with areas being themed around various classic MM stage hazards like timed drop platforms, flame throwers and conveyor belt sections. Once you defeat the four main Gals and move onto the levels beyond, they even start making great use of your powers! See a wall you seemingly can't get passed? Fire the black hole-thing at an enemy on the other side to switch places and warp over there! See a gap that's too large for a dash jump? Jump anyway, then use Magma Gal's Flame Dash to cross to the other side! A ladder you can't reach? Shoot out your Mines, then jump on them to use the explosion to give you a boost! It gets REALLY GOOD once you have all these powers; the levels know that, and are designed thusly.\n\nMeanwhile, enemies are positioned in ways and combinations that almost resemble an "action puzzle"; they'll shoot bouncing projectiles to get you to move to certain safe spots or you'll be able to perfectly take them out one-at-a-time from certain vantage points. It's just like the good old days! Speaking of, the difficulty is tuned to be "NES Hard"; really difficult, but never impossible and rewarding when conquered (and able to be more speedily conquered after you get it down). Sit there and watch patterns, try different weapon & ability combinations, or die and learn from failures when you try again: you WILL make progress... most of the time.\n\nThere are *some* issues that affect the difficulty. The timing windows on some of this stuff is absolutely brutal (particularly the fullscreen flame throwers in the second half of Magma Gal's stage and the explosive, timed platforms on Buster Gal's stage), enemies respawn THE SECOND you leave their "screen" (there's definitely places you can stand still that will cause them to continuously fly in from the edge of the screen, one after the other. Kind of good for grinding, but awful for combat where you have to maneuver in the air while jumping).\n\nEDIT: The developer is doing a good job currently of patching and otherwise updating this game constantly. Issues I had a week ago (I previously mentioned no way to change the controller config here) are no longer here! Meanwhile, the balance on things seem to be constantly tweaked for the better. I definitely have to give a shout-out to the devs for continually polishing this up!\n\nIn the end, I just have a tiny issue with everything. Namely, the music compositions are a little repetitive (they all seem to be variants of the same song to me). But this game is $4 so I know its petty to bring up. What's here sounds good, but it bares mentioning anyway.\n\nThat's it. Every other little issue I had is now gone :D\n--\nOverall, it's definitely recommended if you're looking for a cheap Mega Man style run-n'-gun retro action game. This is an extremely well-crafted little game and definitely provides the fun and challenge you're looking for. This title could absolutely go for $10 and it would put some other games in that price range to shame. RetroRevolution has a quality game here for the price of a sandwich at Burger King. I hope this isn't the last we see of Meta Gal :)","May 27","true","2.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Expect Mega Man, for the most part.\n\nI did like how abilities work, and anticipated getting a new one due to the fact that a lot of them help you get around the stages (like Warp Gal's weapon swaps the places between you and an enemy it hit).\n\nI liked the sprite work, although felt it lacked color, but this might be my own preferences toward the 8-Bit Mega Man games.\n\nThe story is pretty basic, although I liked the attempts to give it color by injecting humor, although I'd have referenced some common Mega Man oddities (like why do they all have a Fortress?). The English was also a bit wonky, but the devs said English isn't their first language, so I can't criticize that.\n\nThe difficulty was hard, as a Mega Man throwback usually is, although sometimes I thought the game got pretty unfair, although those are usually late-game (the pseudo-Quick Man lasers particularly annoyed me in the third Creeper stage). I might also suck at platformers.\n\nI'd check it out, since it's at a pretty low price, and I'm definitely looking forward to seeing the new playable characters in later updates.\n\n...And it also still released faster than Mighty No. 9.","May 23","true","5.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midsinister/recommended/467850/","midsinister","MiDSinister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midsinister/","99 products in account","Let me start by asking, why isn't there a gawddamn dash button? Otherwise, here is my review based on a few minutes of playing each stage accessable at the start.\n\nPros -\n\n- Great graphics. Many of these "indie/retro" games get away with using nostalgia as an excuse for awful sprite work which wouldn't have passed for average 20 years ago. This, however has stage graphics that could almost be in a Mega Man X game. The enemies are pretty decent, and look straight out of Wily Wars for Sega Genesis.\n\n- Challenge. It has the challenge of the classic Mega Man games in the sense that it doesn't overwhelm you with enemies with insane ai or anything like that. It simply has strategically placed enemies with simple yet well-done patterns.\n\nAlmost Pros -\n\n- Art design. Another flaw of "indie/retro" games is artwork that looks straight out of a 10 year old's Deviantart page. This game's character design isn't too bad. Nothing amazing but pretty decent.\n\n- Music. Once again, not terrible but still nice. I personally prefer to turn it off and play some Mega Man X style song covers (dracula9antichapel, mynewsoundtrack, just to name a few. Check these guys out on Youtube for some quality MMX style covers!) Its amazing how much better a game can feel with good music. You'd almost convince yourself that you're playing a Mega Man X game, hopefully not X7.\n\nCons -\n\n- Sometimes stupid difficulty. All I have to say is if you play through the fire stage and experience the whole dashing past the fire traps part, you know..where if you miss your chance the fire is there PERMANENTLY and kills you in one hit if you try going through it, then you'll know what I mean. The game will feel just fine and then all of a sudden you get stupid crap like that, awkward jumps, or whatever else.\n\n- Buster/gun. I will admit that I haven't played through the whole game or unlocked any upgrades, so maybe this is rectified later in the game, but assuming otherwise I'll consider this a con. The gun is definitely not fun to use. You'll find yourself having to use many rapid shots to kill an enemy, but have to wait for the energy meter to recharge constantly. Once again, its possible that this is fixed with later upgrades so if that is the case then just disregard this.\n\nOverall, it is worth getting for any Mega Man fan. For a quality experience, use xpadder and set the game to keyboard to ensure the best controls possible, disable in-game music and put on some tunes you find more fitting, and be prepared to scream at this game a lot.","May 23","true","0.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

I was looking for a game that paid homage to the old Megaman games of old.  Metagal does this in its own way but retains the feel (and difficulty) of those games.\n\nIt's not perfect.  There are some bugs and some issues with grammer.  I did feel like the controls are a bit sluggish.  Shooting while jumping felt a bit off, as did dash jumping.  It felt like it could be me but I noticed a few others mentioned it so it might need to be tweaked.  I didn't run into any gamebreaking bugs.  Just some minor ones but they were there.\n\nThat said they nail most everything else that matters.  The weapons are integrated pretty well into the gameplay.  There are plenty of secrets to find.  The stages and the bosses are diffcult but actually fair.  I got plenty frustrated doing each one over and over but at the same time I learned more about each fight and by the end knew exactly what I needed to do.  The look of the game might as well have come right out of the past.  The overarching feel of the game was great.  It's a great deal at the price as well.\n\nI believe it's worth the price ($3.99) at the moment if you are looking for a good Megaman type game.  It does more than enough right to overlook the current issues in my estimation.  If you're not sure check back again after a patch or two and try it then.

It is a 2d run and gun platformer with a health bar, boss gates, stage select and the other trappings you find in any good game staring a blue robot. Little new ground has been broken but the engine feels more like a late GBA game than the familar NES classics and fangames.\nThe visuals, sound, and controls all meet expectations. The backgrounds are rich and vibrant while enemy designs are consistent and charming. The songs have strong melodies and good instrumentation. The controls are responsive and tight. Sometimes the shots can feel a bit delayed but it seems to be more a matter of projectile speed and animation than input delay.\n\nThe game has two significant failings: text and dash.\nText- The developers clearly do not use english as their first language -and I support game development all over the world- but if they want to market the game  as professionals they need to hire an editor to check their spelling and grammar. Thankfully the story is not the main attraction of the game and the tutorial conveys enough meaning to teach you.\nDash- To dash in the game tou need to double-tap forward. There is no other option. No ability to bind to a button. No ability to bind down + jump.  Every controller that supports this game has enough buttons to bind an additional but the option is absent. Some may find this to be inconsequential but I see it as a clumsy barrier tangling gameplay. (EDIT: they are already working on the dash button patch)\n\nAll things considered it is still a functional and cheap game that should be worth picking up if you are a mega fan running out of fangames.","May 23","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Nothing special or unique, and not very long, but not really that *bad* either.  There are positives, though for each positive there's a counterbalance;\n\n- The graphics are not bad at all, evoking a kind of 16-bit Megaman feel, and the character designs are pretty cute, but there's nothing that really stands out;\n- The music is quite good, sometimes rather great even, but most the game uses a singular motif that can get tiring, and the sound effects are stock trash (with especially bad mini voice clips in the cutscenes);\n- The story is... okay, servicable for this type of game, but the Engish translation and even the formatting of the text in the boxes is embarrassingly bad;\n- The gameplay overall is fine, and satisfying enough for a Megaman fan, but there are some very annoying aspects such as even your default pea shooter taking ammo and shooting only in three-round bursts for some reason (though these problems are SLIGHTLY alleviated via the hidden powerups you can find).\n\nThere's also a weird lack of polish that I feel somewhat bothered by, with things like very swift screen transitions with no boss intro or 'got a weapon' outro to the stages, and how SOME dialogue scenes are skippable while others aren't.  It's also a painfully short game, with four challenging, but quick normal stages each with eactly 1 hidden powerup, followed by 4 'fortress' stages, and that's it, that's the whole game.  Very cut and dry.\n\nStill, though, all things considered, and especially with the price being so low frankly, for a Megaman fan this just barely, baaaaarely makes the cut to be worth checking out, especially with the promise of more content such as various playable characters later on.  All things considered though, if you're looking for a good Megaman fangame where you play as a girl, you'd do better checking out Rosenkreuzstilette, Rokko Chan or MegaMari.","May 29","true","4.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Game is fairly new and fun at the same time, alhough I suggest there should be a fix where when I dash I can be able to jump at any instant, rather than dashing and the moment I try to jump it does not allow me to do so. Very fun game and if you where a fan of Megaman, i highly suggest you play Metagal! :D","June 1","true","0.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

I also fell into the water, like a number of reviewers of said, but I didn't fall through the level.\n\n\nPlaying does remind me of megaman, and it's nintedo hard. Spikes still instantly kill you (Unless you took damage and are blinking.) I died pretty quickly on the first boss, which was not was I was expecting. I haven't played long, but it is fun - I'm just writing a review this soon to help balance out the two that found a glitch when they started.","May 22","true","1.3"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","1"

I saw a few reviews complaing about minor first release bugs, but if you ask me the game is polished and pretty damn impressive overall. With all the megaman nostalgia lately and a certain kickstarter that has thus far failed to deliver anything respectable its nice to see a fresh new game carying the torch.","May 23","true","0.4"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

Controls are imprecise and way too loose, the enemy placement is poor (and said enemies are boring, to boot) and the game just isn't fun to play.\n\nWhile it's less of a deal breaker, the awful dialogue during the cutscenes doesn't leave a favorable first impression of the game. If they're going to charge money, the absolute least they could have done is run a spelling/grammar check on the script.","May 23","false","0.1"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

This being said, I want to like this. I see a lot of potential in METAGAL, but the controls do need some more polishing. The overall feel of the game is like an NES emulator running at a higher speed than usual, making simple things like dash-jumps and even attacking while jumping a chore.\nThe visual style is retro, which is part of the charm of these types of games. The music... I can't say I played long enough to fully comment on; the controls and/or "speed" of the game made me want to quit playing.\nAs the game is now, I can't say I'd recommend it, but as a work-in-progress, I'll be looking forward to seeing what new updates bring. I'm hesitant to give this a simple thumbs-up/down rating, seeing as how I want to see this game bloom into something amazing, but I'll change it when/if it becomes better.\n","May 24","false","0.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

If you want the unforgiving difficulty then sure this might actually be the game for you. Perhaps it was the fact I was using a keyboard instead of controller that increased the difficulty I am not sure but After the Megaman X series I got spoiled. Wall climbing/jumping... thats what this game need. There are a ton of places to fall to your death, spikes and the enemies hit HARD. It is also poorly translated there are several places where gramma have compleatly been ignored.\n\nI would rather do open heartsurgery on myself with a dull spoon than play this game. However if unforgiving games are your thing go for it, if you enjoy Megaman X above The Classic Megaman because of the mobility of the character then stay the heck away from this game, you will facepalm so much that your braincells will belive it is judgment day.\n\nSo Overall: Graphics 7/10, Gameplay 3/10, Story 4/10.","May 23","false","1.1"," 1 of 9 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","1","9","0","0"

This is something every game developer needs to do and usually takes up more than 50% of development time: Polish your ♥♥♥♥ing game. Playtesting, Debugging, Adding Nuance, Putting effort into UI/Controls/Options/Menu/ ♥♥♥♥ing Spelling. Releasing a game that's beatable doesn't make it any less unfinished. You're an independent developer, not a god damned ♥♥♥♥♥♥. If you made the game to begin with you can definitely put forth the effort to not have the most basic, standard, "it works so it's fine.." everything! There's a reason this game is only being sold for four dollars, and it's not because the dev is generous!\n\nUnfortunately, people will still pay for games that are newgrounds-tier quality because they have so little standards that they'll take anything instead of asking for better games, because eventually, developers who want money are gonna have to listen to the majority. So congratulations, you're a game developer profiting off literal wastes of life. If that's the legacy you want to have, so be it. Enjoy your $500 from sales.","May 25","false","0.1"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","1"
