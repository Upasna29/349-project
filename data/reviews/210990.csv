This one seems rather﻿ interesting. If U were even slightly knowledgeable about cycling U would be aware there is a huge difference between managing a team of cyclists and riding a bike casually. It's just like the Football Manager games for football fans. This is the game for the cycling fans. The thing is I like both of them! ;)","October 14, 2012","true","29.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

With no tutorial, clunky controls and an all round bad interface you would be hard pressed to find the positives. Although the game is detailed, the details you actually want are normally several times harder to find than the superfluous details you're struck with.","December 6, 2013","false","2.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","6","16","0","0"
