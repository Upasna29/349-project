It's not crazily impossible or unreasonable but it's not as easy as some of the missions presented earlier.There are no huge new strides in gameplay, but the story-driven campaign is top-notch.The graphics are quite goods, as are the maps, with lots of little places to work around and use for cover. For the snipers out there, you will be pleased.It captures all the essence and excitement of the series even if it doesn't offer a lot of new elements.","February 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

The AI is even more responsive and their movement makes for many surprises throughout probably making this the toughest the game gets, which is already at a do-or-die. The jungle settings are also quite interesting and allow for lots of cover for both your squads but also for the enemy. As always, approaching the targets is important in itself as it will probably alter the way you play out the rest of the mission.\n\nThis is perhaps the pinacle of not only the game Ghost Recon series but also as a tactical FPS genre. A missed shot here or there will probably cost you a soldier or two so be wary. This expansion should be in every library.","May 6, 2015","true","5.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

This one was released in 2002, in same year as the first pack. It still feels like yet another mission pack, not adding much. 8 more missions, more weapons, more multiplayer stuff. It also came out on Xbox. And there was some edition of Ghost Recon with content of this pack for PS2 as well.\n\nWell, seeing that multiplayer isn't a living thing, I don't think that you will care about whatever multiplayer new things, leaving us with single-player content.\n\nAs for new game mechanics, well, I guess it retains unblowable enemy jeeps from Desert Siege.  And that's about it. And I guess that new specialist that has grenade launcher as primary weapon, which teammate AI never bothers to use. Oh, and stationary grenade launchers that are placed in some levels, for usage by enemies. They just never place it to be useful for player, despite letting him use them.\nIt's not like you will count intro cutscenes of each mission where they come in helicopter or a boat as a new mechanic.\n\nAs for 8 more missions, then eh, at this point it's more of same. Not as fun as Desert Siege, it mostly has more of missions in style that annoyed me in original Ghost Recon. Like, having to know that there is enemy who is hard to see and can shoot you down accurately somewhere at the edge of fog. It's a bit harder, with tree covers and such. Still quicksaving like no tommorow.\n\nPlus it also got 5 more maps for Custom Missions, quite interesting ones. Actually, they put a new mode there, Defend, where you must "defend the base". I think that previous expansion pack had it, but it was multiplayer-only deal.\n\nWell, it's not amazing. But still good. Well, no, still fine. Even meh.","October 18, 2015","true","3.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

MP is classic. and for 2001 its pretty good. except the rugged geometry, the sprite explosions. the rough models. and the lens flare sun. OK so this isnt BF3. but BF3 aint no GR. If you are a fan of tactical shooters then you have already played this and I dont need to remind you of how good it is. Revisiting it is fun. and is still worth gathering a bunch of friends together for a no spawn elite run. dont forget the vent.\n\n7.0/10 (expansions included)","March 24, 2013","true",""," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But the increased difficulty throughout is infuriating, even on the Recruit (Easy) setting and even in the expansion's early missions.\n\nGhost Recon's always had unnaturally accurate AI--but it was forgivable in the original and the first expansion because the difficulty was balanced. It was challenging, but not frustrating. This time, however, the AI will see you from miles away, take you out in one shot with an automatic weapon from miles away, and will swarm towards you from all directions or camp in alcoves and take you down the instant you present your hitbox. The enemies, which are supposedly some sort of amateur Cuban rebels, are in fact basically more aware, more accurate and better trained than a squad of Ghosts. It just feels like some sort of broken, halfhearted attempt to increase the length of the game, but instead damages what was once enjoyable gameplay, and will ♥♥♥♥ you right off when you find yourself restarting a mission for the tenth time.\n\n","June 5","false","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
