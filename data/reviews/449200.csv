I'll have my 59 cents back, thank you very much.\n\nEdit: The volume was extraordinarily loud, there isn't even a volume setting. The settings are overall poor. That annoyed me to the point, where I didn't feel like the developer of this game deserves my money already.\nAdding to that I expected a game, that needs me to apply calculus (don't know where I got that idea). Instead I got cryptic riddly language puzzles, I didn't find myself wanting to spend time on..","March 18","false","0.3"," 48 of 79 people (61%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","61","48","79","18","2"

You have to solve various logic puzzles to get through the game. There are 4 difficulty levels; the game's extra cutscene is only available if you beat the game at "hard" or "expert".\n\nLikes    Nicely coloured pixel graphics - Sense of immersion's there.\nSomething of a short story - Lame, but still fun in a childish, silly way, if you're the kind who likes having a story for your game (I am).\nMusic was ok - Nothing great, but it fit the game.\n2 of the puzzles were good - The first and last one in particular required a bit of thinking, though they sadly weren't original in any way (I've encountered puzzles like these many times before).\nGood puzzle instructions - Despite the poor English (see below), instructions were concisely written and perfectly clear. (Maybe the developers only had enough money to pay for someone to vet/edit the puzzle instructions and not the story dialogue for the entire game!!!)\nDislikes    Really bad English - Almost every message box contained a spelling or grammatical error.\nVery short - Minus the time taken to solve some of the puzzles, I'd say it was 30 minutes max.\nVery few puzzles - If I'm not wrong I think there were only about 5 in total, and 1 was repeated.\nMost puzzles were juvenile, unchallenging and very unoriginal - E.g. Touch an array of crystals so that all of them glow; match pairs of cards; etc\nPuzzles have nothing to do with maths - Other than a few that required basic addition skills, the rest tested more of logic. And as you can see from the example I named just above, one even tests memory.\nSilly ending - I rolled my eyes.\nMore for kids or teens - Due to a combination of all the factors mentioned above. Don't think adults will enjoy this that much.\nSummaryI can only recommend this game if it's free. There are too few puzzles, they aren't original (I have seen them all somewhere), the story is bland, and the poor English really kills the experience, especially when there's a fair amount of story dialogue involved. This game feels on the whole way too unpolished for a paid release.\n\nTips to developerYou could really improve the quality and feel of this game by getting a native English speaker to vet through and correct the language. It wouldn't take long and you could probably find someone to do it for you for free.","March 25","false","2.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The game mechanics are really interesting, the story is good, though it's going to be corny as hell in a couple years (well, it kind of is already, but even worse in the future) but the math and logic is really fun!\n\nSudoku: The RPGMaker game.\n\n7/10\n\nDO NOT have your sound blasting (there's no main menu option to control volume, so you have to do it from your comp, but I found it cute it enough to leave the sound on) and DO start on easy before trying the harder levels (humbly work your way up!!)  Also do get if you love sudoku and mastermind/logic puzzle games, but you can definitely skip this if you're looking for a traditional RPG Maker.  Also enjoyed having Marco from One Piece / Butters from South Park as main character.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeyth/recommended/449200/","monkeyth","Tetsuya Kuroko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/monkeyth/","223 products in account","There are 4 different difficulty levels with different puzzle designs. I recommend that you begin with the easiest level;\nI’ve tried the expert level first, and regretted it immediately.\nThen I move from one type puzzle to almost entirely different of puzzle immidiately after one stage. This game fails to provide some good learning curve experience.\nYeah, I could try another difficulty, but judging from the overall impression about the puzzle and the expert difficultty, no thanks. Maybe this kind of puzzle better suits some math nerds, than casual puzzle gamer like me.\n\nEven though it seems that the puzzle is fail to deliver, I find the short story in this game is interesting and fun with the puzzle accompany the plot of the story are well designed enough. So instead of good math puzzle, I get good story.\nThat's fine by me, considering the price.\n\nI'm not sure why some people leave the negative review and others are willingly up vote the review.\nI mean like seriously, for God sake, is it bad just because the volume is too loud?? ( fyi, I find the volume is not that loud, about the same volume like other games I’ve played before, and not even close to the point of annoying)\nEven if it’s true, it's a very silly reason.\nThe music has some original pieces beside the stocks RPGM music, and I think it's good.\n\nSo, I recommend this game for someone who are looking for a good simple  rpg story with some devilish Math problems (not puzzle) in Hard/Expert difficulty.\nAvoid this game if you are looking for some casual math puzzles.","March 20","true","2.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maharito/recommended/449200/","maharito","[BT] Maharito -WRITE mode-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maharito/","259 products in account","A young guy was flipping through a book of recreational math puzzles while a shonen anime aimed at guys just a bit younger than him played in the background.  He started to wonder how to make a successful game that he could proudly show to the world.  It filled him with immense hope and ambition, but the struggle to translate nerdy challenges to far-reaching entertainment tried him mightily.  Hours had already turned into days, then weeks, then months; he now knew the end was coming and he would have to pay his rent somehow.  In a fit of frustration and exhaustion, he attempted a cram session of programming and passed out on the keyboard.\n\nIn a dream, the guy encountered a mysterious and very powerful force that coalesced into a beautiful and imposing figure, a woman of mystery known only as LSD.  LSD invited the guy to explore the realms beyond light and time--a land of wild and supernaturally useful code snippets, with which even the lousiest hack could easily generate interest beyond their imagination.  But to reach the realms, he would have to exceed the greatest foes of his own mind at the very riddles he wanted to use as gameplay material for his star project.  After many tries, with LSD's constant guidance, he surpassed the dangers of Desperation; he conquered Past Failures more easily.  Nearing the realms, Inability almost forced his hand in defeat; but he found a sly detour by simply ignoring it until it ceased to exist.  At the realm's precipice awaited the final foe: a half-naked toddler with a gazeless stare, drool all over his face and body, and torn chocolate-and-crayon-stained papers crumpled messily in his sticky fingers.  Though he struggled mightily, he could not beat the toddler, who always seemed to know his riddling moves better than he did himself.  For what seemed like an eternity, the two waged a mental war until finally one finally exhausted and gave up.\n\nWhen he woke up, the guy's mother picked him up by the trainer-pants and put him back in the playpen.  She did not recognize the crumpled papers in his hands, though some of the handwriting clearly belonged to his father.  She thought nothing of the tatters of math puzzles and story problems upon them.  But when the father returned to his computer that evening, he panicked to himself that his hidden drug stash in the dusty old notebook by the monitor was suddenly gone!  And even more strangely, his Steam program now contained links to something he had never seen: the Steamworks API.  Therein, he found that his account had somehow published a game and posted it on Greenlight without his ever knowing.  He tried the game himself, but quickly gave up in frustration.  Somewhat amazed but mostly confused by the whole series of events, he decided to let the Greenlight process go on its own; when the game was actually published, he didn't even know how to take credit.  In truth, no one would.\n\nThat game, by the way, was called Jesus Christ RPG, and it's still better than this piece of crap.  In fact, you probably had more fun reading this than you would with this game.  In fact, I spent longer writing this review than beating this game.","March 31","false","1.1"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","9","16","4","0"
