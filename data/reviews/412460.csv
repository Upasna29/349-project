It has a really low replay value.\n\nThe story to the game pretty much follows tutorial missions. The story was somewhat interesting yet definitely one of those stories you probably do not want to hear again.\n\nThere is a lot of comparison between Villagers and Banished. The similarities are both there and not there. Seeming how they are both medeival builders there is always going to be similarities. Meanwhile most those spouting the similarities avoid the simple answer. Which would you rather play Banished or Villagers? Since I own both I would pick Banished even without mods.\n\nSo why the thumbs dumb?\n\n1. Maps. The game does NOT have a random map generator. I mean seriously, that is the majority of the replay value of any sandbox builder game. There is no map editor either.\n\n2. Production balance. After playing a while the production values of various buildings seem very wonky and unbalanced.\n- Barn had animals that pretty much died of old age before producing enough offspring to keep the barn producing.\n- Other production issues resolved.\n\n3. Combat. They tried putting some form of combat into the game.  Wild animal attacks and raiders. Honestly never should have bothered. Neither raiders or wild animals actually killed any villagers so kinda not seeing the point in investing in guards. It looks like the raiders basically ran in stole some stuff and ran off with it.\n\n4. No refilling jobs. Anyone who played Banished knows this one. If a villager dies their job should be automatically filled from the pool of available laborers. Not having that feature in this game made it annoying once your settlers start dying off and you miss filling their job.\n\n5. Bugs. Quite a few have been fixed however still a couple big ones that can ruin a game through population aging and starvation.\n\nThe game is getting better, there has been work on it since release. It just aint quite there yet I would recommend people to buy it. However if I knew someone that bought it, I would not make fun of them for owning a crappy game. So almost a thumbs up.","March 26","false","21.9"," 137 of 164 people (84%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","84","137","164","4","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Temko/recommended/412460/","Temko","Temko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Temko/","137 products in account","Villagers is a bit technically incompetent, having quite a few stability issues, some performance issues and abysmal animations. These are offset some by the lovely crafted graphics for the various buildings and objects with great attention to detail.\n\nFull review:\nView the video for the best possible and most accurate impression & detailed information.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkTZBPCh8RE&ab_channel=GuyLogic\n\nSummary:\nWhile the games system are competent and work in nice cohesion between the gathering, trading, crafting and refining processes. There are a few flaws that mostly stem from the way the game has decided to create maps and allow for population growth.\n\nSee, population takes forever to increase and while much like banished - which this game is a, albeit less good, copy of for the most part - population (micro) management is what this game is all about, you have to make sure people get babies, and those babies grow up to get more babies so your old people can die and your town doesn’t starve and get murdered by bears.\n\nAll good right? Except that housing is a major investment initially, and you need to get quite a few, that take up a lot of space & take quite a bit of time to get children and they take time to grow up.\nThis is doubly made worse by the map design decisions where campaign maps are reused for the "sandbox" maps... but aren’t adapted to fit with a sandbox mode, meaning that resources those maps might not have in the campaign (such as stone quarries or iron mines) heavily restrict your gameplay should you want to play those maps in sandbox mode.\n\nThis, while SOMEWHAT combatted by the x10 speed, really isn't a solution. The slow growth and the issues with maps bring together to create a problem that the game simply can’t solve in its current form: You'll never have enough housing to grow enough people to maintain enough infrastructure (pharmacy, market, church, farms etc...), because you can’t gather those resources initially due to population limits, and "faster" doesn't help this seemingly perpetual cycle.\n\nAlso because people who have a task, often wait too long to get food and what and simply fall over and die of starvation when both their house, the warehouse and the barns have all the food they could want. Which then compounds your problems to grow more people.\nLastly, the game tries to distinguish itself from banished by having a campaign and being a bit more forgiving. Sadly, while the campaign story is pretty fun, it only lasts 6 missions and those combined have a total gameplay value of 4 or 5 hours, they are a glorified tutorial more than anything.\n\nSo combining all of this: PC Performance / stability issues, Population + Ai issues + map design issues as well as the very limited campaign, I simply cannot recommend this game in its current form, just get Banished, it’s the same …but better in every way. And has extensive modding support.","March 25","false","25.9"," 134 of 204 people (66%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","66","134","204","7","5"

It's about managing resources and build up a nice town with many villagers.\nYou will get everything you expect: Unity engine, orchestral music, common UI features you like and love. What you will also get is a campaign and story! Nice, eh?\n\nBanished? Settlers?!Like some people mentioned: this game is like Banished! Yes! And it has some features from Settlers. Yes! But you have both what's a really neat feature! From Banished you will know the city building itself, from Settlers you will be reminded of the campaign where a real story stands behind all your actions. Banished does have NEW GAME and TUTORIAL. The first one is like an endless game, the second one is just a guided play through of certain game aspects - very basically and technically - without any story or "soul". With Settlers you have a big production game which sometimes offers "too much" although you want to do this or that, the game wants you doing certain milestones - very strict to a story.\nSo it would be harsh to say that Villagers is just a rip-off. It borrows the best elements and combines them in a very attractive way.\n\nThe good    Very nice story. Every action you make has some background and you are not doing just "this" or "that".\nNice characters. Since the dialogue is very well written, after just some encounters you have an idea, how character A or B is.\nCharming combination of game elements of Banished and Settlers.\nGame is running very well on Windows and Linux since Unity is used.\nVery good development studio. It's small, but nice. You get your answers at once and support is done very quickly. Remarkable!\nThe bad    Some minor bugs, like "hanging" Villagers when a new mission comes up or a disappearing mouse pointer on the mini-map when you play for hours. I'm sure it will be fixed within the next releases.\nAlthough there is a "free play" mode, the maps are not randomized and are too tiny. So you can't play them "endless".","March 27","true","13.7"," 45 of 63 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","45","63","0","2"

Many pros and cons can change after a couple of patches.\n\n\nSo the first thing everyone will say: It's like Banished\n\nWhile that statement isn't that far off I find Villagers' freegame mode to be a completely different type of challenge.\nEverything is kept small, beginning with the numbers of villagers to the limited recources and jobs.\nThis results the challenge to be micromanagement and carefully placing new buildings.\nMore often than not I found myself starting a new map and my people quickly starved to death or got sick.\nEvery single guy seems to make a difference and I'm always in need for more after I managed to get my food supply working.\n\nYou might say that some aspects I see going for the game are bad. Everyone has his tastes, so here are my Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n\n-Slow but steady growth.\nI am thankful for every new worker\n\n-Requires attention.\nAs I said micromanagement is important. You might miss a tiny detail on why whatever you are working on makes no progress.\n\n-No grid based maps.\nMin/max players might find this one debatable, but I like putting down buildings around a village center in circles.\n\n-A rather colorful style.\nHaving a friend who says Banished is too depressing, this is a welcome change.\n\n-Tutorial in form of a storymode\nYes, a tutorial is important to me. While it doesn't prepare you too well for the freegame mode, it really helps exploring possibilities.\n\nAnd most importantly: The devs are very active and listen to the players.\nThere will be at least weekly patches. Expect many bug fixes and new content.\nHeck, they still improve Ghost Control Inc. which came out years ago.\n\n\nMore Pros may follow.\n\n\n\nCons:\n-Bugs and slowdowns.\nA great annoyance, indeed. But really I haven't seen a bugfree release in a while when it comes to smaller studios.\n\n-Tiny gameplay annoyances.\nPutting down fields for the farm can be a bit of a pain if you want them in a very speciffic place\nIf you want to place any building in a free space you can't do it if a villager stands there\n\n-Questionable AI priorities.\nSometimes I get the feeling my villagers do anything BUT the job they are assigned to. Fulfilling personal needs like going to church etc more often than not. They don't even go get medicine despite being sick; their only reason for being unhappy\n\n-Speaking of not doing their job:\nI have encountered which I believe is a bug where woodsmen and herbalists won't do anything. Leading to wood shortage or when a disease breaks out there's not enough medicine to heal everyone. Villagers burn through 32 medicine (max for one herbalist hut) quickly and until the the next outbreak I don't have nearly enough despite resources being available.\n\n-"disasters" aren't much of a threat.\nExcept diseases(reasons given above), bandits, wild animals, storms and lifestock infestations don't have much on an impact.\n\n-Maps will always stay the same size, no random map creator.\nThis one might be the most important con to some. Personally I haven't reached the point where I either wished for a bigger map or seek the challenge of random maps\n\n\n\nCons might be added or deleted in the future.\n\n\n\nI cannot find a lot to dislike which is not patchable. The devs will look into it, no doubt.\nIf you are looking for a game which has not too much depth to it while keeping your attention, check it out once it's a little cheaper or on sale","April 6","true","21.4"," 26 of 33 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","26","33","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/taytothief/recommended/412460/","taytothief","taytothief","http://steamcommunity.com/id/taytothief/","6467 products in account","You'll likely read a lot of comparisons between Villagers & Banished. And for good reason. Both are Medieval City-Builders and both sell around the €20 mark, with Banished selling at €18.99 and Villagers at €19.99.\n\nThere is no contest. Banished is highly regarded, while Villagers is an entirely underwhelming experience. A long-winded, convoluted and tedious story begins when your character, by virtue of their natural-born "City planning" skills, is tasked with building a village. Each mission serves as part-tutorial with new features and buildings added with each new settlement you move to. Invariably each mission involves setting up your town hall, and gathering resources before some deus ex machina prompts you and your village to move along to somewhere else.\n\nThe shortcomings don't just end with the story-line though, where Villagers really falls flat is the lack of depth and difficulty. There are very few specialist buildings and very little micromanagement involved. For some, this could be a plus, with Villagers definitely offering a more casual experience than Banished, but for myself, it falls short of what I look for in a city-builder.\n\nIn terms of presentation and UI, Villagers offers a fairly simple interface thanks to it's lack of depth and the graphics are OK. I would expect users to have few problems running Villagers, visually it offers nothing remarkable or demanding.\n\nIn short Villagers is an expensive, casual city-builder, with a poor story and unremarkable features. And being priced more than Banished results in a disappointing experience.\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/.","May 12","false","7.6"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

It needs a little more polish but is still very fun. It's similar to Banished, but offers more challenge than Banished.\nThere are stealing bandits and attacking wild animals. The little villagers are alot more animated, they dance when happy, have little conversatiions with each other, become depressed when they don't have a mate, not little robotic things like in Banished\n. The game actually makes you concerned about your little people rather than being a _ how large can I get my population, and how large can I get my towns.\nI put alot of hours into Banished, once you know the what and when of the beginning, it's pretty much smooth sailing. The mods helped alot to increase the challenge and add production facilities, new buildings, etc,. They're great, I don't play without the mods.

Even more annoyingly, at one point my entire village simultaneously died "of natural causes", the seasons sped up to a blur of constantly changing, but despite the fact that everyone was dead according to the population screen, there were still people wandering around the village. Zombies, presumably. Also, I couldn't figure out why my farmers would only grow vegetables despite having a grain field as well, they never touched it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiny_Pirate/recommended/412460/","Tiny_Pirate","TinyPirate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiny_Pirate/","148 products in account","I’m going to recommend this game, but I’m going to caveat it with some big buts. And not the kind that one can not lie about. Villagers is fun, but it’s a bit derivative and doesn’t offer much in the way of fresh gameplay. Villagers is pretty, but it isn’t going to knock your socks off with its beauty (see Planetbase for another, pretty simulation/builder game). Villagers is entertaining, but not deeply engrossing like a truly complex or deeply engaging builder game.\n\nAll that being said, I’ve enjoyed my time with it, bugs and all (see the end of my second video below for seasons and people going a bit.. weird!). If you see this on sale, and love builder games like Banished, the Anno series, or Planetbase - well - consider picking this up. You’ll get ten or twenty hours out of it, and then you can move onto something else. As I put it in my vids, this game is good filler when you want to play games but don’t want to have to think too much.\n\nIn terms of gameplay it’s the typical indirect control you expect in base building games: You order trees to be cut down, rocks to be dug up, and buildings built and your minions go about doing it. There’s pleasant music to keep you company and some quite nice looking seasonal changes. The main challenges are getting food made, progressing up the tech tree, and keeping your people breeding so there are always fresh adults to work your fields and buildings. Yes - citizens become old and useless if you don’t keep them happy and breeding!\n\nUnless you’re freeplaying there’s an entertaining (if a bit silly) story that you can play through that also doubles as a tutorial. It goes on a bit long for my taste, but there’s some fun to be had there. Free playing seems a little limited right now as it looks like only a couple of maps have all the resources you need and you really do need a lot of resources. Although you can trade for resources, that takes away stuff you will want to build with and can leave you waiting around for, literally, trees to grow if you are resource short. That can be a bit tiresome.\n\nTo summarize: This is a fun builder that with a couple of patches and a good price you should pick up if you’re a big fan of the genre. It isn’t a game you’re going to be dreaming about and plotting about while you’re at work or school, but it is fun if you accept these limitations and treat it for what it is - a good distraction and a bit of a chuckle.\n\nBelow are two videos I made showing off the freeplay mode. They should give you a good sense of the scope of the game and the general style of play.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTSwf4M3mpo\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mEU9EdgNVLY","April 1","true","5.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

It's easy to pick up and play with very little challenge. I can't give it a positive rating because although I didn't encounter any bugs the game itself just isn't that great. There are not really that many buildings so there isn't a complex production chain to learn and there aren't any decorative buildings and there aren't even any roads. It doesn't seem to matter to your villagers if they live on a diet of a variety of fruits vegetables bread meat milk eggs....or if they just eat fish. Might as well just have 2 fishing piers. There is an herbalist in the game who gathers wild herbs and creates medicine. But in the entire campaign playthrough I never once saw a villager get sick and need medicine. You can build a chruch and the priest will bless houses and the villagers will go to mass, but if you turn the church off for an entire year they don't seem to mind all that much. Maybe the happiness goes down a little so they work slower but it's really not noticable. Overall the price is too high for what little you get of the game. It's lacking the complexities and decision making that makes city builders fun.","May 8","false","13.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

ALOT.\nThe design of this game is well done and things are easy enough to get a handle on fairly quickly.\n\nThe only issues that I have been currently having to deal with are\n-Farmers just forgetting how to do their jobs ( just not farming in any season )\n-Villagers falling through the map and then dying due to starvation\n-Foresters not planting trees or chopping them down.\n\nAll in all though, this is a very fun game and way better than bannished.\n\nAlso I have noticed that at X8 speed ( which I have set to most of the time ) villagers tend to freak out\nand just run in place looking all glitchy for about a min or 2.

It does however, so a positive differential between these two games would swing my vote.\n\nThe initial difference you will find is the visual novel superimposed upon the game. The story is written with some competency and as is the way with v.n.'s, it's quite in your face about some of the sordid details of life. Now when I first booted this game up it asked whether I was female or male, the default being female, this told me that the developers were targeting the fairer sex and that coupled with the visual novel aspect, really puts me out in the cold.\n\nThe game itself, is fine, the standard resource collection and settlement building is in place. Nothing separating it from Banished, save for the fact the simulation is less complex. There are nice touches, the way you build a jetty was quite nice and well thought out.\n\nThe graphics, they're better than Banished but only just, there is the most desperate need for SSAO, if they added that it would look so much better. The models, functional, again no better than the aforementioned game, no specular, no bump, modest scale textures.\n\nI won't touch on the maps, or lack thereof, the future will tell.\n\nAll in all, if the story was reflected in the code, this would be the most amazing game but at the moment, the separation between the two is so large, it highlights the loss of direction this team has experienced.","April 7","false","3.7"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","3"

Unfortunatly at this time a I can't recommend Villagers, it just needs a bit more work. I made a video review to better showcase the aesthetics and gameplay mechanics, if you prefer a written review you can find that below.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yOZ8v_uKBw\n\nVillagers is a town building game by indie developer Bumblebee, it focuses on village expansion and resource collection while also trying to keep your citizens happy and well fed.\nI’m reviewing this game in mid March 2016, about 2 weeks before the game is officially released on the 25th of March. Which technically makes this a pre-release review but I think we can safely assume there’s not going to be any major changes in such a short amount of time. I should also mention that the developer sent me a review code for this game, I’d like to think it hasn’t biased my opinions but I thought I should disclose it anyway. The current version number I’m reviewing is 1.003.\n\nAesthetics\n\nFirst off, Villagers looks absolutely beautiful. There seems to be two ways you could go with this kind of genre, either a cartoon or a realistic aesthetic. The realistic style works really well here and looks very nice. It runs very nicely too, I don’t have the best gaming PC but I have everything cranked to ultra and I’ve had no problems with it whatsoever. The minimum requirements needed to run this game are very easily achievable.\nThe boarders in this game are fantastic; the maps are surrounded by an ‘old-timely’ grid reference which gives it the feel of a ‘live action’ ordinance survey map on the table of an inn. I’m not sure if that’s ever been done before but I’ve never seen it.  It addresses a sometimes overlooked aspect of RTS games – “What in particular defines that as the boarder?” and “Why is that side of the field more important than the other side?” It would be cool if the developers took this one step further and added big pints of beer in the background or rulers and a compass etc.\n\nGameplay\n\nVillagers looks very similar to the game Banished. And I think that statement translates over to the gameplay as well. There are a lot of mechanics that are very similar to Banished and even when Banished was first released, people were saying “Hey this is a good game, but it’s going to take the modding community to make it into a great game”. Comparing the day one releases of Banished and Villagers, Villagers is a lot less ‘fleshed out’ and personally I think it’s the lesser of the two. On top of that Banished has had a 2 year lead with the modding community, which have helped to iron out any initial problems with the game and add a lot more content.\n\nVillagers also has a problem with the pace of its gameplay, things seem to happen very slowly – especially at the start. This is the kind of game that you could set up and leave for 20 minutes or half an hour and when you come back you’ve made some nice progress. Admittedly I’ve never made a large village which I assume would help to speed up the gameplay to a more enjoyable pace. However at that point, due to the lack of content, you’ve probably built all the available buildings anyway. The most villagers I’ve ever had at once was about 20 but there are steam achievements that go all the way up to 100. Thankfully there’s the option to speed the gameplay up x10 but I don’t think that’s enough, perhaps x25 would help to remedy the initial slow pace of the game.\n\nThere are two main gameplay modes available; the first is freeplay which is pretty self-explanatory but I’ll touch on that later. The second is the campaign, which also doubles as the tutorial, so if you do buy this game I’d recommend you play the campaign first. I’m hesitant to call the campaign a glorified tutorial because the narrative is so strong. Personally I actually really enjoyed the campaign and I’d have to say hats off to the developer Bumblebee for making a really interesting narrative, especially in the genre of game where you are essentially just building a town over and over with different objectives. That’s not to say that everyone will enjoy it, I’m sure you can imagine there’s a huge about of writing needed to spin a good plot into a town building game, none of which is voice acted at all so there’s a lot of reading involved. The entire campaign has six levels and probably took me around 4-5 hours to complete, which is a testament to both the amount of reading involved and the slow pace of the gameplay. There’s a funny part early on in the campaign where it explains about the foresters’ lodge which can plant trees to be later harvested, technically those trees should take 20 or 30 years to grow which completely contradicts the narrative, but they just point at it and joke about and don’t even attempt to avoid it.\n\nThere are three main building materials in this game, wood and stone can be used for most buildings and iron is needed for more advanced buildings. There are also three main ways of getting these resources, the first is to just pillage the land of what’s lying around, you can get wood and stone this way but not iron. The second way to get resources is to build a structure, I’ve already mentioned the foresters lodge for wood but to extract stone and iron from your map you’re going to have to build a mine, which can only be built in a very specific location. I’m bringing this up because the freeplay maps are exactly the same as the 5 maps available in the campaign. Early on in the campaign when it hasn’t explained about mines yet, there’s no need for the maps to have the specific locations where you can build mines. Which means that if you go to play that map in freeplay, you’re limited to the third way of gathering resources which is through a merchant at the warehouse. Which is a shame because the first map of the campaign is probably my favourite, but the very limited method of resource collection makes the gameplay incredibly slow. There’s obviously an easy fix that the developers or modders can do, just add those mining areas to the initial maps and the maps will be much more enjoyable.\n\nSummary\n\nAt the moment I don’t think I can recommend Villagers and I feel terrible for saying that because this game has been developed by a small indie company who have obviously put a lot of work into it. It just needs a little bit more work, there are some problems to address, some bugs to iron out and there’s definitely some more content to add.\n\nI Hope you found this review helpful!","March 25","false","10.5"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","1"

Just from start and Story Mode, Villagers are diferent kind of game, it has useful and helpful missions as tutorials, awesome artwork, characters and nice story.\n\nIf you don't want to bother with story mode, you have FreePlay mode, where you can chose one of 6-7 fixed maps, and play until you die or got borred :D\nRessources system are well optimized and with great tutorial people who are new to this type of games won't have trouble to start it.\nWhat I think it's special about this game, it has some personal touch, for example in FreeMode you will start with 10 villagers, they will get married, you watch them grow old, their kids married have their own families and your village expands, it is nice touch to watch how families mix one with another to prospere.\n\nGraphic has nice and quality textures and models, nothing spectacular but it is enough to please everyones taste.\nGame sounds are filled with enjoyable medieval music along with overall sound effects, a very good job!\n\nNow to keep review shorter;\n\nPRO's:\n+ Graphic\n+ Sound\n+ Ressources and NPC system\n+ Potencional\n\nCON's:\n- Low replayability (no random maps or editor, 27 buildings is to small for my taste, lack of random events, no diplomacy)\n- Price (19,99 at my opinion is too much with current content this game has to offer)\nP.S. I think Banished is overpriced too XD\n\nOverall:\nMaybe dev's should release this as Early Access until they add more stuff in game.\nI am recommeding this game to everyone who are in simulation/strategy games, because of it looks and potencional, however if you do expect tons of hours of fun spent in this one, maybe better wait for more content or bigger discount.","March 28","true","6.4"," 19 of 36 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","19","36","0","1"

I did received a key from the developers for review purposes.\n\nFirst, to address the elephant in the room that is already spamming reviews. Yes, this game is quite similar to Banished, That certainly is not a bad thing to my mind, and not at all shocking considering how broad the godgame/city manager genre is. They both focus on a similar scenario and involve many of the same resources, buildings and issues. That is not to say, as some reviewers have suggested, that this a copy of Banished. It plays and feels quite distinctive and focuses much more strongly on presentation and storytelling and less on hardcore survival.\n\nThe game is your typical village management game. Each villager is fully simulated with a day/night activity cycle. No villagers are directly controlled but rather carry out duties as assigned\n\nFor the bad, In it's current state, there are rough spots, but nothing major. It does graphically twitch a bit when running at 10x speed which is a bit of a problem considering how often you have to resort to time compression.\nSome of the UI and controls are a bit unintuitive but mostly from lack of polish rather from irreversible bad design.\nThe world seems very mild, although this may be just because I'm playing the early campaign. Villagers are obviously perturbed to not have houses to sleep in, but they don't seem any worse for wear from sleeping in a frozen swamp.\nOne rather large flaw I found, although I might just have missed it or not unlocked it yet, was the lack of a deconstruct option for completed buildings.\nMoving on to the good, I think there is a lot to like here and promise for more as the dev's polish the title.The controls are refined with full camera control, building rotation, etc. Villager management is by assignments which can be manged either ay work-sites or the central town hall. Most menu and gui components have an icon for a simple tool-tip explanation and many cross-link with other interfaces.\nOther than the aforementioned lack of exposure issues, the game doesn't seem to include any city-builder "cheats". Villagers have to walk to work, haul the goods from where they are gathered to where they are stored or used, go get food or water. Nothing teleports magically from work camp to warehouse.\nIt has a campaign/story mode. This is something so many developers sadly skip. Instead of being dropped into whatever situation that has been contrived for me and given a full toolbox of tools I don't understand yet, Villagers instead gives you a traditional introduction.\nThere is a big attempt at providing a deep back story. The presentation is a bit clicky and the plot a tad cliche, but the developers are making an effort to provide an impressive frame of reference to your game play.\nAlong with that back story there is a decent tutorial woven into the narrative. So far there hasn't been a moment when I didn't know what I needed to build next and why. I can't expect that this game will require a wiki or mathematical analysis of field sizes to get the most out of it.\nThe artwork is a bit outdated but still quite lovely. They could go for some higher resolution textures of higher poly models, however. The terrain is decently diverse and the various weather effects add a lot of personality to the game.\nAlthough the dev's decision to go with handcrafted maps will ultimately hurt replayability, the diversity and character really shines through. The swamp felt like a swamp rather than just a procedurally generated airbrush of water you find in so many games.\nCertainly not a "casual" title but far more approachable than most, this title has some potential to be a great village management game. It's fully playable and far more developed than some of the "other" comparable titles that languish in perma-early access.\n\nCurrent state: 7/10","March 27","true","8.2"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","20","38","0","2"

The similarities to Banished are minorly asthetic, and the characteristics that come with it being a god game.\n\nWhere Banished is a punishing and intense game that requires extreme dedication and time; Villagers gives you a bit more of a break and lets you discover things with a bit more time to breathe.\n\nAlso not included in Banished is the story mode you get with Villagers. Its great to discover how you've become the planner of your cities and why you are trying to protect your people. This is also a wonderful introduction to the mechanics of the game.\n\nAnd various other differences arise as you play through the game. Most notable is dealing with merchants is done with coin, rather than a straight recource barter. This is nice because you can use what is at your disposal to pool one recource for trading with wandering merchants.\n\nTL:DR  Villagers only looks a little like Banished and plays similarly due to them being connected through genre. There are many different and exciting things to discover within this game and should not be written off as just another clone.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5zJMX594bk","March 25","true","6.7"," 57 of 111 people (51%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","51","57","111","5","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/graystillplays/recommended/412460/","graystillplays","GrayStillPlays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/graystillplays/","42 products in account","If you're a visual person, I made a video of my review, which can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBOKpDGcipw\n\nToday we'll be checking out a brand new Medieval Village Building Simulator appropriately named, Villagers.  Villagers is a colorful new city builder/manager with a sense of humor.  I consider Villagers to be the Zack Morris of City Building Simulators, as it has absolutely no qualms with breaking the fourth wall and making fun of itself with a lot of light-hearted humor.  Everything from how exactly trees grow so fast to be harvested to the various menu options are discussed by the well drawn and colored characters that tell the story of a young city Builder, which is of course your Hero.\n\nFor the review we'll be looking at four basic categories, Gameplay, Sound, Look, and Polish.\n\nGameplay: The gameplay of Villagers is fairly intuitive.  The controls are responsive and simplistic, with the left mouse button often selecting whatever it is you are clicking on, and the right mouse button deselecting.  The tutorial is extremely thorough, to some, maybe even too much so, but it nonetheless does an excellent job at teaching one how to access various menus, construct buildings, assign villagers to various professions, and utilize the different resources found in the game.  The gameplay of Villagers can be quickened or slowed with the help of convenient fast forward and pause buttons, which are a very welcome part of the game.  The gameplay of Villagers is both fun and fulfilling, with enough variance due to the inclusion of a story mode as well as a free mode.  The only issue is that the story mode is extremely short, giving most players approximately 3-4 hours of gameplay.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\n\nSound: The music, ambient background sounds, and various effects are one of Villagers greatest successes.  The effects utilized for accessing menus, making selections, and moving through options are perfect.  The music itself is rich, appropriate for the setting, and very tastefully done.  The ambient background sounds are good, with various cheers, coughs, crowded talking, as well as effects for the buildings and even the more obscure actions, such as the firing of a hunter's bow.\n\nSound: 9/10.\n\nLook: The game is crisp and colorful.  The animations are smooth and the addition of various wardrobes dependent upon the profession is a welcome attention to detail.  The “map”, being represented as if it were a drawn cartographers map come to life on a tabletop is a fresh look at the very word itself.  The animations for the villagers are basic, stiff, and a bit repetitive, but still somewhat appropriate for the tasks that they complete in their daily routines.  The inclusion of snow accurately falling on horizontal surfaces during the winter, as well as the flash of lightning, the obscurity of fog, and the pelting of rain creates reasonably believable seasons.  The artwork of the game is professional and well drawn, with the coloring and shading done in an aesthetically pleasing manner.  All in all, the animations and artwork are not perfect, it is clear that effort went into producing a strong quality.\n\nLook: 7/10.\n\nPolish: The game suffers from great polish in some places, and a lack of polish in others.  Now, some of these issues may be fixed in time, but I'll mention them as they are now.  The name I had chosen for my character, although absurdly lengthy, could not at all fit in the placard upon which it was placed.  This caused the letters to flood over the sides, creating a very amateurish look.  The animations themselves, while appropriate in action as I said before, are not at all in the correct direction or area.  For instance, a hunter hunting a boar will fire an arrow to the right, but the boar to the left will die.  The various screens, options, clicking reticules etc are well done, and the script is mostly well written.  There was at least one area that I found where a portion of text in the story script was placed in the game twice, as if it was cut and pasted into the game two times.\n\nPolish: 6/10\n\nOverall, Villagers is a solid Medieval Town Simulator for an Independent Developer style of game.  There are areas to improve, but the attention to detail and the eccentricity of the game is very welcome.\n\nTotal Score: 7.5/10","March 25","true","6.6"," 22 of 42 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","22","42","0","0"

Like not every survival game is Don’t Starve, because you cut wood and make fire. But I guess people always need their comparison.\n\nI sometimes miss a certain freedom in the campaign though, making my own decisions when to stop a campaign or how to approach a challenge in a lesser tight arrangement. But together with the story restrictions make sense and work out. I only followed the story campaign so far, so I haven’t played any sandbox game, yet.\n\nBanished is the more perfectly balanced game, but can also feel a bit meaningless or dull after some hours. With Villagers the story gets a nicer feel for what goal you are actually working on. Especially the love that flew into the character creation is visible.\n\nWhat I hate though is the resource management/transportation system. Makes no sense, is not really transparent and feels like everything takes thrice the time if it were better planned. I’m also not a fan of the day/night cycle…\n\nI highly recommend it to everybody who loves medievil building games!","April 1","true","9.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

With Villagers, it seems like bumblebee was trying to create Banished with a campaign storyline, which is the main thing that Banished lacks, so that was a good goal. Unfortunately the missions are really buggy, and the pacing is off -- some are too easy and quick, and others are almost too hard to get through, partly because of bugs like merchants getting stuck in warehouses and never leaving. And all the clicking through the dialogue boxes can get seriously maddening.\n\nFree play mode is more fun. The game mechanics are a lot like Banished: you have to be careful not to grow too fast or everyone will starve to death, but grow steadily or your population will crash as your villagers age. There are guestworkers you can hire, but they can't move in and start families, like the nomads can in Banished. The trading system is much too simple. It seems like I can only trade wood, stone, and iron, and occasionally pick up some beer. Meanwhile I've got two barns producing a surplus of farm animals, meat, milk, and eggs, and I can't unload any of it to buy the wood that I've run out of because the foresters seem to plant trees at a geologic pace.\n\nOnce bumblebee works the bugs out, Villagers should be fun to play, and especially if they can fix the campaign mode, it will hit a good middle ground between Banished and Settlers.

Food is tough to gather, and so is stone and iron. Water is also a resource you need to watch. The villager reproduction rate also makes it challenging because losing one villager is enough to topple the whole system. Some people think that makes it too hard, I love it.\n\nCons:\n-> The game is buggy. Villagers do not move into houses that lose a family, so you end up with a bunch of homeless people while there's perfectly good houses sitting around.\n-> Farmers do not interact with the fields very well. As far as I can tell, the 'harvest fields prematurely' button doesn't even work.\n-> I had a few cases where merchants stopped showing up, I would have to build a new port or warehouse to bring them back.\n-> Limited help. There's not really a 'help' program in the game and there isn't a wiki yet. The campaign will teach you a lot, but I still don't know if it is possible to demolish a building or not.\n\nDespite the bugs, I would still recommend this game! I've logged almost 7.5 hours so far and I'm still on the campaign. It's a good, challenging game that will take you time to get through. All of my cons are bugs, and I'm banking on most of the bugs being fixed by future updates.\nFinally, if you're looking at this just because it is 'like Banished', buy it with a grain of salt. Both games have you building settlements from the ground up, but Villagers focuses more on the story/campaign and less on the sandbox mode.","March 29","true","8.7"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

The game is set in medieval times and as such life is not great, you’re constantly raided, food shortages, harsh winters and you’re spread very thin as you try and get your village together. I wouldn’t call this a city builder, more like a simulation of medieval life.\n\nThe game is harsh, you play for hours for 2-3 babies to be born, and hopefully they can survive through the winter before their mother gets attacked by wild wolves. Resources are limited and with a very small starting population it’s hard to cover all the bases. You’ll be spending your first years with a dozen people, with those dozen people they need to be set roles that all need to be filled, someone die? Well that just means you’re going to have to have no baths this month. Have everyone in your turn working jobs and no one to be a guardsmen? Pray to god you don’t get raided.\n\nOutside of the harsh setting the game itself doesn’t lend itself to being easy to play. Poor AI leads to a lot of wasted time and with poor explanations on a lot of the jobs a wasted opportunity. I’ve seen farmers for days straight just walk around my city as there are crops that need watering and picking. Sawmill worker, whose job is to plant and cut down trees, sleep in front of the town hall as there are no trees planted in my set area.\n\nThe game is rough, there’s no denying that but I did enjoy playing the game. I liked the idea of being put into a harsh setting where it wasn’t all big city lights or not handed to me on a plate.

Few downsides like some dodgy animations and campaign being on the shorter side (6missions). Most time spent will be refining towns in freeplay mode. Maps are a little on the small side, perhaps not progressed enough. Presented well overall with a clean functional UI and soundtrack I didn't feel like muting. Plays a bit like banished crossed with settlers. Feel the price is about right due to current content and lack of multiplayer but if you're tight on funds and buying for missions, it may be worth waiting. Runs on unity so performance is decent, only scales to 1080p (firstworldproblems). Toggles for dof/AA/AF/AO and the standard low-fantastic options, see no reason why it won't run on low spec systems.

Same concept, basically same building types also.  Better graphics for sure.\n\nCampaign mode:  if your a reader and like lots of story line content then campaign mode will please you.  Personally I found the story dialog banter wanter to long and tedious.  Some story cut scenes required 20+ OK button clicks to get through it all before you get back to building.\n\nFree Play Mode:  As expected a sandbox mode.  Where it lacks is that it only provides 5 different maps to choose from.  Unlike Banished where your world terrain is generated dyamically.  Once you try all 5 map scenarios returning to the game is repeat.  Not only is the world terrain the same for each map, so are the resources allocated to your game session.  So you will nothing new replaying a map.\n\nPotential bugs I found:\n\nAfter playing one free play map for about 3 hours at 5X time speed I STILL haven't progressed passed 20 villagers.  I've built just about all the types of building that could be built.  Half of them sit empty because by the time an infact grows to adult hood 1 or 2 of your working adults dies from one reason or another.  Usually natural causes.\n\nMerchants arrived only 2 times within the first 30 minutes of game play.  Once I upgraded my fishing pier to level 2 not only did the trader boats that were passing by stop coming by completely so did the land merchants.  So Gold income has completed stopped.  Thankfully I purchased some livestock before that happened.\n\nSpeaking of livestock, I purchased two chickens and two pigs.  Chickens are supposed to reproduce rapidly but I have found the pigs repoduce more than the chickens and within the hour I have a barn full of pigs and no chickens because the shepard killed them all for no known reason.  I checked and had plenty of food so it wasnt due to food needs.\n\nAll my villagers complain early for wanting a bath, which by the way is maybe the most expensive building to erect resource wise.  With a quarry built on a a stone outcropping that contains 150 stone resources, once my total stored stone resources reaches 40 no more stone is mined from the quarry therefore never allowing me to build the bath which requires 70 stone in total.  I have a town hall that currently holds 0/15 stone resources, a warehouse that current holds 12/30 stone resources and the quarry itself which is maxed out storage wise with 32/32.  I have 3 warehouse workers allocated but noone ever moves the stone from the quarry to the warehouse or townhouse so the quarry just grinds to a halt.  This is a bug with AI I am very sure.\n\nSO... first impressions are mixed.  If the developers continue forward with this release, adding omre free play scenarios or a dynamic worl generator that will do alot for game play longetivity.  Clearly there are bugs needing resolved.  Lastly the game is badly in need of some game balancing such as I pointed out previously, population increase TEDIOUSLY slow to the point of making the game almost not enjoyable once you've got around to building enough resources to support the 15 - 20 villagers you manage to expand to.  BTW.. thats a total of 20 villagers after 3 hours of game play and the free play mode starts you out with 10!\n\nWhile 16.99 isn't a lot of money I found myself wondering if I my money would have been better spent on another less than 20 dollar game here on Steam.\n\nAll that said I am hoping for an looking forward to seeing if the developers continue to expand on it.","March 25","false","28.3"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","1"

It has great potential to be one of my favorite games. However, it's too similar to Banished for me to enjoy enough to keep playing, and it still has some bugs that could mess up my village (farmers forever farming veggies, even when deleted. To fix: Reassign the farmers, but the field will be visually stuck there barren.).\n\nPros:\n-Funny adult humor (ex. the stork arrives shortly after hearts fall from the sky on a house and moaning can be heard XD)\n-Creative attention to detail (ex. the stork, different clothing) - I would like to see more because these separate it from Banished\n-Nice new style - different types of animals run around freely, each character has a spouse (even if this isn't obvious by their interactions other than making babies), the professions have different clothing (farmers look like farmers), etc.\n-I enjoyed watching my villagers. Even though they had a job, they slept at night, talked at the town hall and raincatchers/wells, and helped each other up if someone fell down.\n-It feels like the environment of the map I chose, and it feels quite alive (the way the merchant comes is kinda awkward for me though)\n\n\nCons\n-The map I played on was really small; I could see the issue of space down the line\n-Too many aspects of Banished. It feels like if Banished was simplified, given a new look, and had a couple cool added aspects.\n-Not many buildings - I know, it's small, and it does add upon and tweak Banished buildings, but it feels like there could be more since it has a villager-focus. The baths are a nice touch. Maybe a courthouse and random divorces? A school housefor the kids?\n-Some aspects don't seem to work as they should - Why does the merchant only want and sell building materials if he clearly has a food stand? The journal opens up in freeplay mode behind a lot of the other menus, such as when clicking on the town hall.","April 12","false","2.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Goodluck.. they breed and eat like rabbits.\n\n3) Lags when you reach 55-65 villagers.  There is so much going on at that point if you managed to provide enough food that you get this weird lag.

It does so well at doing what it does best, it looks pretty darn good, plays really well and I've yet to come across any bugs bar the one I mention in the video. It has alot of gameplay to sink into and alot of challenges to try and attempt to get past, hope you're ready for spending the wee hours playing!\n\nCheck out my first impressions here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cGkdegojmU","March 26","true","1.8"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

I think overall this game is too green. There's no instant gratification, there's no entertainment. You follow the tasks but they're not even fun. And OMG what's going on with all the text! it's like the Wikipedia times 10. Everything comes witha long text even if you're just cutting a tree I mean come on! There are 6 villagers to start with, and  they will all talk and talk and talk. And you cant even close those texts right away, they even have a slow slide animation. At one point your screen will be full of messages and texts of all kind, none relevant, none enjoyable, none entertaining.  This game feels like filling paperwork.\n\nAnd for the record I  do appreciate a good story. But this is not the case. The text is just noisy. There's no script, some villager drama at min 0? why would you care about this long complaint made by a hunter about patroling woods when you dont even have a house and are trying to figure how to make the dumb villagers move and chop some trees. It's so dumb","April 3","false","0.2"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I have not much time to play and i really love to have a intense story who i love to follow along and have some hours of fun. This game might not be at its full potential, but overall its one of the best i have played for some time now.\n\nYou can fully manage your Village and see by clicking on each villager how its mood is at this moment. The game has a great depth for this price. If you have some money to spare you should give it a try.\n\nOverall Rating: 8/10","March 27","true","8.0"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"
