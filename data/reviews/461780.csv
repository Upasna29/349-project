Very Rough. The tavern runs itself once you get a starting cook. No one needs you. It's incredibly disconnected. Your guests are your quest givers who occasionally vomit on floors. That's it. Adventuring costs you money in health potions. The difficulty grade of quests only changes the amount of maps you have to run through till you reach your goal. Notice "run through" as you cannot realistically fight and expect to survive. Each time you die it takes 10 points from your max health, ensuring your next death comes that much quicker. You can forage for ingredients sure. But the items you pick up are worthless for vendors, eliminating that route for early game cash. Leveling only allows you to use the next tier gear and is pretty much a joke. The most cost effective way to earn money is to sit on your hands and do nothing while the clock ticks over into another day. I wanted to like this game. I like simulation games. This feels like a rushed, unbalanced, grab at fans of Stardew Valley. Save your money and wait. Hopefully, with some work, this will be a good game. But right now it's not worth it","May 14","false","11.1"," 94 of 109 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","94","109","0","1"

Still, even with a few problems and frustrations, I've played the game for four hours, so it isn't all bad!\n\nI've found the game feels very unpolished and clumsy, and if I had known the game was in this state, I would not have purchased it.  However, I love the premise of the game, and I'm going to hold onto this game rather than request a refund, in hopes the developer will polish it up a bit and make it run smoother.\n\nThe framerate is terrible, and moving around it feels like the screen is constantly making tiny jumps, instead of smoothly flowing with the motion of your character. The tutorial is barely adequate, with a talking cat helping you find your way along a little.  Combat was confusing to me, and my familiar "passed out" as well as myself passing out (-10 max health after awakening in the tavern) and I have no idea how to see how much life my familiar has.\n\nUPDATE on screen jumpiness: Turning off effects helped a bit, but I'm still having troubles, and my computer, although two years old, isn't poor by any means... Still, I watched a couple videos on YouTube of this game, and noticed others are able to run the game fine without the screen jumpiness I experience while moving.\n\nIn town, the menus are clumsy, and I learned the hard way I can't simply switch from purchasing to selling items, without first exiting the purchase screen (by hitting esc) then hitting sell to get the sell menu.  I ended up buying something I didn't need by accident trying to switch screens instead.\n\nI think this game might be fun after spending some more time getting used to how poor the UI is, and maybe taking some anti-seizure medication for the screen jumpiness.  here is hoping the game improves with time and patches.","May 13","false","4.0"," 69 of 88 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","69","88","4","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/elkentot/recommended/461780/","elkentot","the elk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/elkentot/","6 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDisclosure: I was given this game free in alpha as a direct download and through Steam in\n\nbeta, this has not affected my review!\n\nMy Background:\n\nI’ve been playing games by FlynnFour Games since I backed STAR-BOX on Kickstarter. I have al ow/average pc and so I enjoy it when low spec games like these are produced with modern ideas. If you feel it matters, I am a girl.\n\nThe Review:\n\nThis game is two things in equal measure: a sandbox tavern sim, and a quest oriented, action RPG.\n\nThe first it does well, immersing you in the daily chores of a tavern manager in a fantasy world: mopping up sick, speaking to guests, hiring staff, setting prices, repairing leaks, chasing of rodents, dealing with bandits and hauntings, and generally upgrading the place to make it more accessible to a whole host of humans, gnomes, dwarves, fairies, and so on! As for the quest oriented RPG part it does this fine, not amazingly, but fine. There are plenty of different quests to go on from finding  eggs to hatch to collect new pets, through collecting resources, to slaying dragons. It is let down very slightly by the combat which is basically shoot stuff with guns and wands, or hit them with your sword (depending on your class). Personally I prefer to rely on breeding up a strong accompanying pet, or hiring heroes rather than doing much fighting myself. You still get all the rewards and XP if you let your companions do it, so I just run around foraging the maps as they do all the killing.\n\nOne of my favourite parts of the game, as you may have guessed, is the creature breeding. A talking cat has told me that there are around 50 collectable and breed capable creatures. You begin with two working stables although you can upgrade to five (please devs add more I hate sending pets away). You can get new eggs by going on quests and by breeding your creatures using genetimagic (don’t know how to pronounce that). Breeding creatures is simple yet fun, although crafting the magical ingredients can be difficult.\n\nCrafting is a huge part of the game. Alongside cooking there are so many armors and weapons, magic potions, scrolls, and magic gems that it can be, at first, a little overwhelming. Learning where to get all the ingredients from (which there are definitely over 100) is a challenge in itself.\n\nThere is of course a story, and although it uses some common fantasy tropes, such as a blight spreading across the land, it does so in a way that is new and interesting. I especially like that the elves seem to be the bad guys, although, as in all games by these devs, the whole world is cast in shades of grey rather than in black and white. The story is also linked directly to your success as a tavern manager which is obviously important. I’ve not finished the main storyline yet but I think I’ve guessed where it is going due to reading some of the books located throughout the world.\n\nMy Last Hour of Play:\n\nIn my last hour of play I purchased another tavern (you don’t get to manage it but you do get profit).\n\nI went on a quest for some magical ink to write out a scroll but I still need to find a feather before I can craft it. I got killed by some orcs in a mine. I did my daily forage and was annoyed that I got no feather. I spoke to my guests and met some new ones (all guests have a funny few things to say – definitely worth talking to. I tried to get married but there is a curse on my potential husband and need to go on another quest.\n\nPros:\n\n- So much to do – although can be a little overwhelming.\n\n- Great characters that you can talk to and get quests from.\n\n- Interesting story.\n\n- Can start as one of ten different characters and six classes.\n\n- Beautiful pixel graphics.\n\n- Breeding pets!!!\n\nCons:\n\n- Simple battle system – although can be mostly ignored.\n\n- I have to turn off weather effects when its blowing as it makes my computer lag. (2009 laptop)\n\n- Sound effects need to be more varied.\n\n- No journal so you have to remember what to do or go back and ask again if you forget. In a normal RPG this wouldn’t be so bad but it’s easy to forget when you’re running a tavern.\n\n- No window mode!?!\n\nOverall I would give this game: 8/10 – However you must be aware this is an RPG Maker game, and not a AAA title.","May 13","true","9.9"," 50 of 81 people (62%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","62","50","81","4","2"

The main quest is cool and engaging: even though I dont want to spoil anything, let's just say that there will be tons of interesting guests at the Tavern.\nOn a side note, there are a few issues here and there, mostly with the resolution and with the menus, but it can be easily fixed with a patch and it's not a big deal, overall.\n\nI was pleasently surprised with this one, to be fair.

As someone who has played Apocalypse Hotel, I can say that this game has a vastly improved interface and seems to be a much bigger world, which I'm excited to explore.\n\n----OUTDATED----\nThe problem is that the game is rather unoptimized and the low framerate has prevented me from doing much of that exploring. I'm giving this a thumbs down for now, but if the framerate issue gets fixed I'll edit this review as necessary.\n\nNote: While I consider this to be unlikely, I won't ignore the possibility that it is my computer causing the issue, rather than the game. If you are reading this and are experiencing similar issues, let me know in the comments.\n----OUTDATED----\n\nNEW VERDICT: A fix has been added to the game. Pressing the 9 key will disable lighting effects, which (for me at least) has solved the framerate issue. With that issue out of the way, the game can be played smoothly. The game itself is essentially a revamped and improved version of Apocalypse Hotel in a fantasy setting, so if you were a fan of that, you will enjoy this.","May 13","true","1.0"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","20","28","0","8"

For a indie title it is surprising how very well achieved it is as a product overall and I will start to explain:\n\nThe game runs perfectly on me after turning the effects off. Honestly it wasn't impossible with them on, just slightly laggy. It is a smooth experience, and most problems I've read about have been addressed by the developers in a very fashionable timeframe. Always good to know that the game is just not released as is, but a work further developed as bugs get pointed out. As someone already pointed out in a review, Performance Issues seem to be the only issues with the game so far, and that was taken care at most cases.\n\nYou get a big Tavern to run, a Hatchery for your pets (yes, a whole pet hatchery system) and a big world to explore. Beside the normal tasks that you will get from running the Tavern, there is much more to be done in-game, and the tutorial day will get you started with pretty much all you need to know. Day and night cycle, and each day will sum up how much you did with your tavern, listing both expenses, taxes and of course, profit.\n\nA lot of the game is set on exploration, so do not expect to be told about everything exactly. Some things you just have to go and give it a try (like Arena fights or promotions where you can get extra currency or special items). A whole lot of the game is based on completing some tasks so others can be unblocked (or used, like most buildings). At all times it will be required that you do your best from a day, and that implies task>exploration>task routine.\n\nGraphically it has a lot of "eye-candy", as everything is done in pixel-art style and always looks coherent with the rest of the scenery elements. From a visual appealing color palette to the little nice animations here and there, pretty much everything adds up to the gameplay itself. The tunes are nice and match the magical dimension you are playing in.\n\nThe user interface is very simple and works great too, the only think I would "touch-up" is really how the dialog system behaves. I would add extra smoothness to it, but it turns out to be a detail as they work perfectly as is (and I mean, you can always clearly read what you are supposed to read). I would point out the resolution issue, but it seems the development team is already at it. And maybe a couple of achievements would also add out to the experience and hook up players even more!\n\nSo if you are still wondering, I'd say go for it. It's a game you get to love very quickly and for the work obviously put into it the price tag is really low ;)","May 14","true","4.9"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iridium/recommended/461780/","Iridium","Iridium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Iridium/","329 products in account","I like the overall concept of the game but the execution here is terrible. The controls are... nonsensical is probably the best word to use. For instance, the escape button works to exit some menus but not others, and their claims of "mouse 1 to attack" seem to be incorrect. And also weird, because you wouldn't otherwise have your hand on the mouse at all. Further, gamepad support would be very helpful here, but of course it isn't present.\n\nAnd of course, no way to remap keys. Or at least not that I can find: the menus are another example of execution issues here. You can hit a button to bring up audio and graphics options, which launches a Windows options box with check marks and all, but doing so doesn't release the mouse cursor to you to actually have an affect on it, and therefore I haven't been able to click through the menus.\n\nI'd love to be able to say "but the story/art/music is so charming that once you get used to the controls it's great", but those aren't stellar either. The music is ok but not stellar, the art kind of irks me for reasons I can't quite put into words, and while the story (so far) is ok, the dialogue for it is weak. You don't feel transported to a magical land, you feel like you're still struggling to figure it all out.\n\nIf this was an early access game, or it had had a lengthier QA / testing cycle (as in, getting someone who was willing to provide direct and honest criticism to play it), then it might be in a better state and poised to sharpen itself up with some patching. It doesn't at all feel like that's the case here.\n\n","May 20","false","0.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Yes it's unpolished, but the devs are trying to take care of that.  Others are hating on how difficult/simpistic it is.  Either hire a human basic cook at the beginning and sit on your hands wasting time away or lose in frustration to the Royal Tax Collector (who seems to be the biggest actual enemy in the game).  But there's a pattern to everything.  As of this review, all you have to do is remember six dates:  the 5th, 15th, and 25th then the 6th 16th and the 26th.  The first three are when the arena happens and at 1900 the organizer needs rooms for his guys.  At the start an easy 300 gold.  The second set of dates is when the true archvillain of the game shows up, the tax collector.  Seriously?  What tax collector shows up that many times in a single month?  He's pocketin most of your harrd earned cash, no doubt.  But, if you stockpile meals with the cook, open rooms slowly, you can easily deal with these obviously over TRITE obstacles.  Just kill/gather enough to make up the differece and soon you'll be able to wander/kill/gather/kill to your herat's delight.  And as a bonus, please take this into consideration:  At 0600 (the start of the new day with the management screen popping up)  everything resets.  So, if you're in, let's say, a DRAGON HORDE MISSION, and you've cleared everything out  and it's close to 0600, just wait there until afterwards and watch every chest close and refill with goodies.  And don't forget about the Shadow Famliar.  It can be a major boon if you take the time.  The game is not perfect, but it is a very good time management sim that deserves some credit.","May 17","true","10.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Its pretty good, especially for the price, but low end computers might struggle a bit.\n\n\nHey there, if you're being discouraged by the bad reviews note that almost all of them are due to performance issues.\nIt doesn't seem to be optimized the best since I'm also getting fairly poor framerate, but I'm fairly certain that has more to do with my system than the game itself. He did update for a "no effects" option and that has helped slightly.\n\nThe game has been very charming and entertaining so far. The visitors to your tavern all have different quirks and stories to tell, and the variety of crafting/pets its nice.\n\nFor its price I think this game is well worth it, especially if you have a system that can handle it well. Hopefully it will be optimized a little better here in the soon future for people like myself.\n\nI'm not sure how limited RPG maker is, but I do have a couple suggestions for the developer, other than making the game run smoother.\n\n1: Maybe make it so loot from baddies is auto picked up when walking over/near it.  Sometimes when an enemy dies their loot gets sent flying behind some trees and it can be quite difficult to find.\n\n2: More random events within the tavern.  These travelers and heroes have character and it would be fun to see them interact more, maybe get into bar fights, have a druid accidentally set something on fire, that sort of deal.  I'm not sure if these are already implemented as I'm still pretty early into the game.\n\n3. Customization. Lots of people enjoy personalizing and making something their own.  If possible maybe implement some sort of decorating system. (different flooring, wallpapers, rugs, tables, mats, etc. That can be placed where they want, so you can make it different.)  It will make you feel more so like you've actually built it up from the ground.\n\n\nJust a few suggestions, but otherwise its a real solid game so far, just needs some polish.

You go out and adventure so you can earn silver to fix up the Tavern. You can add new rooms, hire people, add new facilities and many other things. Meanwhile there is enough information to guide you through various quests so you an unlock more areas. Eventually you will be able to even open new taverns. The graphics are not that great everything is in 8-bit (similar to the old NES,SNES, and Genesis) but I don't know as if great graphics would really add that much to the game. In terms of stability I must say this is one of the more stable new games I have come across. I have had no crashes and only a couple of minor glitches none of which hurt game play. Like all RPG games there is definately a level of grinding so you can earn money to fix up your tavern. The quests are a bit redundant taking you through a series of randomly generated screens. Over all I like the game I have spent 15 hours playing it as of the writing of this review.

I was expecting more of a Sim feel than an RPG retrospect.  This game has a Final Fantasy feel to it right off the start although, it is very different from any Final Fantasy game.  I really like the day and night effect feel giving you a small amount of light to see your surroundings.  This gives you a feeling of terror when trying to move around the map, and you are unaware of your surroundings.  The death part is also something I found to be interesting, even though your character loses 10hp when you die, your heath points will go back up.  I like the fact the when you die, you do not need to reload your game, you just reappear in the tavern to continue where you left off from.  Moonstone Tavern can go a long way with new updates improving the overall game and game mechanics.  I do not see anything wrong with the way the game is at the moment, and I would recommend for anyone to check out Moonstone Tavern if you are an RPG fan.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/461780/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","NOTE: This game was given to me by the developer for review purposes. This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Moonstone Tavern is the latest game from Michael Flynn, the developer of other great and original RPG Maker games: Apocalypse Hotel, Star-BOX, and Fortune's Tavern: the Fantasy Tavern Simulator.\n\nI have all of Flynn's other games, lacking only a couple of DLC, and I immediately added this one to my wishlist when I saw it on Steam. So bear in mind that I'm a bit of a fan; Flynn's games have been the most enjoyable RPGMaker games that I've played.\n\nMoonstone Tavern plays a lot like Apocalypse Hotel, but in a fantasy rather than a zombie-infested, post-apocalyptic setting. You play a very green adventurer who inherits Moonstone Tavern from you aunt, whom you've never met. Arriving at the tavern through a portal, you are greeted by your aunt's talking cat, who guides you around the tavern and grounds and introduces you to the basics of the game.\n\nIf you've played Apocalypse Hotel then you'll be familiar with the gameplay of Moonstone Tavern as well: alternately manage and improve your tavern, and go out on adventures in search of loot and resources to use on the next round of tavern improvements.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Moonstone Tavern is a RPGMaker game, so the graphics are as you'd expect for this engine: generally quite nice low-res graphics, in this case with a fantasy theme. The tavern itself and all of the maps I've seen so far are well designed and nicely laid out.\n\nThere have been a number of reports of poor graphics performance, and my laptop has these issues when playing Apocalypse Hotel as well, which I put down to issues with the RPGMaker engine on this hardware. However, I've not run into the same problems with Moonstone Tavern, which is a welcome surprise. The developer has been working with the community to try to identify and resolve these issues, in any case.\n\nSound - Sound isn't the best. The cancel sound (when pressing escape to close a menu) in particular is grating and too loud, but most of the other sound effects are okay. The music is quite nice, but seems a bit too electronic for the setting; I'd expect some nice classical flutes, rather than the electro vibe I get at the moment.\n\nGameplay - When you start a new game you get to choose the sprite you'll control for the game, as well as the generic 'class' of your character, based on his or her ability with magic, swords, and guns.\n\nGameplay is extremely similar to Apocalypse Hotel, but in a fantasy setting. In your 'safe zone' -- the tavern -- you wander around keeping track of stats, talking to guests, and tending to the running of the hotel. You then venture out of the safe zone into the surrounding areas, killing creatures that respawn each time you enter the map and collecting the loot you find, which is hopefully what you want to further your tavern enhancements.\n\nIt's a formula that works well and keeps you playing for longer than you mean to, with that "just a little more" feeling dragging you on to the next map, to complete the next quest, or to get enough silver to upgrade the next room. Unfortunately it doesn't include Steam Achievements, which would make this striving feel a bit more worthwhile.\n\nPersonally, I've been running into the same problem I had with Apocalypse Hotel, although not to quite the same degree: I keep running out of ammo and other necessary resources. I'm not sure if it's intended to be this way, or if I haven't quite got the hang of it yet, but each time I've played I've fairly quickly exhausted my ammo supplies, relegating me to melee combat whenever I venture out in search of food or other supplies. And I also keep finding myself changing map without intending to.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ A good sense of humour\n+ Tried and true formula, polished from Apocalypse Hotel\n+ Lots to do! Moonstone Tavern will keep you busy for a long time\n+ Responsible and responsive developer, with a proven history on Steam\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- It could use a copy editor: "Choose the character which you'd like play as."\n- The cancel sound (pressing escape from a menu screen) is awful\n- Hard to get started; not enough ammo, and basic resources are expensive, although the gift of silver near the start helps significantly\n- It's sometimes hard to tell when a dead-end pathway on a map is just a dead end, or whether it will lead to another map\n- No achievements\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================I really like Moonstone Tavern. It's a nice fantasy rework of Apocalypse Hotel and although it's not quite as original anymore, it's still a very good game.\n\nThe lack of Steam achievements brings it down a little, as do the numerous errors in the writing, but the cat-led tutorial works well and there's plenty to do once you get the hang of how the game works.\n\n7/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","May 16","true","2.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","9","18","4","0"

After a few minutes in, you'll discover that the tavern is understaffed and dilapidated, and requires your hard work to return it to its former glory.\n\nPart of the game involves you searching around the rather giant map, looking for ingredients to help feed your guests, as well as repair the tavern itself. Unfortunately, in "RPG-land", there's no such thing as safe, hence why there are monsters for you to battle all over the place. Thankfully, you won't be doing it alone, as the game has a pet system employed to help you protect yourself. This system isn't the type of thing that simply got shoehorned in, as in actual fact there are 50 familiars (pets) for you to take along with you and help train up.\n\nAesthetically, the game may disappoint some people with the fact that it is an RPG-maker game, but thankfully the developer themselves have opted to implement their own art assets for the game. Ultimately, this has only increased the enjoyment of the game, especially when you spend some time searching around the dilapidated areas in the game.\n\nOverall, Moonstone Tavern does a number of things different from your conventional video game, and breathes a little extra life and hope to the RPG-maker engine, an engine that tends to be linked with laziness, but with this title it makes sure to stay well away from such a feeling!","May 16","true","0.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

This review is made purely on whether or not I would recommend it or not as it is a Review. Trolls will be ignored. And Flamers will just make a fool of themselves as I watch them flame for some unknown reason.\n\nReviewer: Codex\nGame: Moonstone Tavern\nDate: 5/20/2016\nTime Posted: 11:01 PM\n\nFirst off! The negatives!\n\nThis game is fun and it really is..However I do not recommend it until they add more content. There is alot of repeat quests and such. And you can only marry one person (I chose the Unlikely Hero.) and to top that off the relationship between you and her in the game is totally rushed and find that they didn't work at all on the marriage system of the game.\n\nNow I wouldn't be upset about it if you NEEDED to be married in order to continue with the story after a certain point. That's right! You heard me. You have to be married after a certain point in the storyline. And to top that off, the only person you can marry is a girl who you talk to in the town. Once you talk to her she flirts with you a little and you flirt back. Suddenly she says for you to prove that you love her and get married.\n\nWhich I think is VERY flawed in a Marriage system.\n\nThere are also not alot but a few spelling errors such as when it is time for breakfast in the tavern, the tavern folk say "*Race name* break their fast"\n\nIt should be "*Race name* eat their breakfast"\n\nThere is also not much content as I said from up top as there is alot of repeated quests which can probably be boring for alot. Unless you are a person like me who enjoys playing it regardless.\n\nAnd onto the Postives!\n\nThe story is very interesting! I will not go into detail as it is spoilers I can if some request it and I will edit it later but for now nope.\n\nYou can get a familiar! Which is basically a pet/compainion! All of them are very different and you can only get them either by breeding other familiars, getting eggs as gifts from the tavern folks, or finding eggs from the quests you get.\n\nLOTS of upgrades for the Tavern! I don't just mean alot! I mean ALOT. Even now I am still upgrading my tavern I got all of the rooms upgraded up to 400 silver and now all I need is to upgrade all of them to 1000 silver..Which is going to take me awhile.\n\nArena betting! You can bet on who will win or lose it all at the Arena! The chances get lower as you upgrade the rooms for the combanants! However the lower the chance the bigger the reward. I got 3500 silver from winning the Arena bet while the rooms were maxed out on upgrades.\n\nGain Piety! And gain the help of the goddesses! Everytime you donate to the churches or do a good deed like donate to charity you will get piety which you can use to use magical scrolls that can grant you any effect depending on what scroll you got.\n\n\nThis is a great game! It really is! And I see potential! But for now I don't recommend buying it until they add more content and tweak the major stuff like Marriage and etc.\n\n___If you liked my review and want to see more reviews in the future please follow me on steam.____\n\nStay safe! And stay cool!\n\nReviewer: Codex\n\nEDIT: "Break their fast" is not a spelling error or coding error. Someone has informed me that it is based on the olden times and I looked it up some more, and it turns out they are right.

But the reason I cannot recommended this game is that currently it has some major issues with frame rate, and optimization, currently (5/17/2016), it is a good game idea, and if you want to support more, hopefully better games from the dev, then buy the game, and maybe try it out, but as is, I wouldn't call it really playable from my experience.\n\nFor reference, I have 8 GB of ram, and an Intel i5 -3570k CPU","May 17","false","1.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

The game is HUGE, and has a large, explorable world that you don't often see in indie games.\n\nI like the old school graphics and gameplay - they are reminiscent of old TurboGrafx RPGs like Dungeon Explorer\n\nThe combination of a simulator/management type game and a quest-based RPG is genius, and this game pulls it off well.\n\nMany RPGs these days hold your hand through the entire game, with quest markers, etc. - Moonstone does not, and that is a good thing. I like the challenge of actually reading the dialogue in order to figure out where to go next.\n\nThere is a fully featured pet system - neat!\n\nWhen a day ends, a screen appears saying "Day Over" - and you continue playing where you are. I really like this, as I generally find it annoying when games have you respawn in your bed at the beginning of a new day.\n\n---\n\nSome minor suggestions:\n\nThere are a few issues with movement/controls - they just require a bit more polishing\n\nI would suggest that items like coins be automatically picked up when walked over, instead of requiring a button press.\n\nAbility to move during dialogue would be nice, but not a big problem.\n\n---\n\nOverall, despite a few issues, Moonstone Tavern is a very good game.","May 15","true","1.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Well, first off, I got this game for free to play, enjoy and do Let's Plays of. When I first started, I started with out a class, which in all honesty, was funny. Other than that, starting out, things worked great! Tutorial was pretty straight forward, (im just an idiot at times XD ), Things start off easy, getting customers and making food and all that. I like how you have to manage things, like making sure you have money to pay any employees you hire, cleaning up sick guests messes, the diversity of the races you have in your Tavern, etc.\n\nA familiar, a great ally that can heal you, once you get a fountain repaired, is a wonderous thing. Even better is when you can repair cottages and have heroes to help you out. Makes things much easier to deal with, so you can gather more resources needed for things, like making food or crafting your own gear. And in the recent updates, you can ride a unipony, though I've yet to find one. And there's new merfolk beds just recently added as well. Combat is pretty fun. I've yet to try other classes, though I've been a Sword Saint since the beginning.\n\nEach weapon has a interesting effect/animation when you attack regularly, like the Fall Sword has a bunch of stars that come out when you hit an enemy. Underworld sword has fire. Even heroes have weapons like that as well. Your allies don't die either, they just get knocked out. You can revive them with revive potions too. When you lose all your HP (if it doesn't bug and transfer control to a allied unit, though you should either let the hp get to 0 or rush the quest, cause if you strike at all with a companion, the game will crash)  you go to your room in your tavern, so there's no game over.\n\nYou only lose a small amount of health or magic, which isn't a big deal! There's a few side quests, as well as the main ones and the quests you get from your customers. There's varying difficulties as well, ranging from easy, to impossible. I Suggest you don't take impossible, unless you have a couple allies with you, that being a familiar and at least 1 or 2 heroes. It's a fun, casual RPG. A lot of the time, it's hard for me to quit the game, even after finishing an episode of it, because it's addicting to me. Like all RPG's though, there IS some grinding, but you don't have to grind too much, really. Oh! Also, there's someone that everyone 'loves'. It's the Tax Collector as well! Giving him other things, like food or piety helps reduce the tax costs, though, if you're making enough money and don't want to sacrifice anything else, pay in full.\n\nIt's honestly not that much, compared to what you'll be making. Basing the taxes on number of people and rooms and such, can be a pain, but it's nothing you can't fix :D. The music is fairly interesting too. It seems to change after every few screens I think, I couldn't pinpoint the timing on that ha ha. Things only got better with updates/patches. Over all, it's a fairly enjoyable game! Sure, it had some bugs here and there, but most of them weren't game killing. By that I mean, making your game crash. Definitely worth playing!","May 13","true","36.4"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","4"

Here pick an Avatar... Pick a class (kinda?)... no details, just a vague here you go make choices. I would have appreciated my choices having some meaning and maybe creating a back story other then walking out of a ?Portal? and talking to a cat? Oh my aunt left me a Tavern? The charms of investment into the why is just as important as the what. I have only played a tiny part, I doubt I'll play more. If I ever desire to spend/waste time going any further in the game I made have more to say, but I'd simply recommend to the people who want a game with a reason to look elsewhere.

So I just randomly hear gunshots. The basic movement feels... disconnected and clunky.\n\nIt becomes clear pretty quickly that adventuring is what you are going to do, not quite so much of running the tavern itself, so the premise devolved into a generic 2d action rpg a little quickly.\n\nI hope this will be developed further, but right now it just doesn't feel like enough to spend the time grinding.","May 19","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has both a main quest line and repeatable quests of various difficulty that strengthen the main character in different ways.\n\n\nPros -\n\nLots of depth to developing the tavern\n\nEnemies are fairly difficult to start\n\nMarriage, familiar system, and hired heroes for a fairly large party (main character + 7 others that I know of)\n\nCrafting system to make most gear, as well as food for the tavern and other things\n\nCons -\n\nHeavy lag inside the tavern, less in combat but still enough to slow the game down and make fighting more jerky than it should be\n\nWhile there are many different enemy sprites, there are apparently only two kinds of enemies (melee and ranged) with no real distinction between any of them; higher level enemies sometimes move and attack faster, making them very dangerous, but there's no inherent difference between a dragon and a blob of goo.\n\nBad follower AI, party members often get left behind or trapped inside enemies and unable to fight\n\nClunky UI, mouse works in some areas and not in others\n\nA lot of terrain that looks like obstacles but isn't\n\n\nThis type of game is rare for RPGmaker.

It should have been developed more before being released.\nPros:\nNice art style, kinda like an old RPG.\nLots of freedom in what you do - sorta.\nYou can explore a lot.\n\nCons:\nNo instructions whatsoever, They tell you how to move around, but not where anything is, or how to do anything other than find the bartender. For God's sakes people, just put some signs up!\nQuests are all the same. You literally find all the same quests in difficulties you can't choose.\nIt takes forever to get any money, especially in quests. This is compounded by the fact that you have to pay A LOT of taxes. I'd either remove the tax system, or make getting money much easier.\nThe 'romance' is flat, one-sided, and doesn't take any 'story' progression at all. Seriously, this game needs a lot more work before I'd buy it, even for eight dollars. Also, the movement is shoddy.\n\nOverall, needs work. It's a neat idea for a game, but they went a bit overboard in terms of NOT THINKING about what they were doing. I returned the game for steam cash within two hours.\n\nSorry if this seemed like a bash on the developers.
