The crafting is more like how Terraria does it, you collect materials and choose something to craft, you won't be forced to lay out your resources on a 3x3 crafting grid during combat :P\n\nThe graphics are awesome too, what is lost in texture quality is more than made up for in particle effects with explosive plasma grenades, explosive sniper rounds, explosive explosives, and glowing swords.\nYou read this right, swords.\nGlowing, particle trail active, slashy swords.\nWhich give you superpowers.\nThen again, so do most of the weapons.\nJumping, dashing, vision enhancement, telekinesis, (you can redirect projectiles) the list goes on!\n\nWords cannot do this game justice, and just by signing up you can get cool exclusive armour, too :P\nShameless referral link, please click me[playminimum.com]\nAaaand if you purcahse and play while the game is in Early Access, you get an exclusive reskin of the Inferno Katanas to play with :D\n\nTL;DR\nQuake + Unreal Tournament + Warframe + Dota + Terraria + Michael Bay\nANGRY TITANS\nKillstreaks\nLots of weapons, lots of armour\nSuperpowers\nBuy now get extra swords\nGo play it now.","May 9, 2014","true","118.2"," 538 of 671 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","538","671","0","7"

So take some of my comments on tactics or ways to play, coming from bringing old game knowledge into a new game with old gameplay style.\n\nTL:DR If you don't like fast paced, twitch based combat, with no bullet drop, no lead time, and point and click weapons ALA unreal, or OG CS. you'll hate this game, because it will punish you for being a bad player. if you like those things and have always been good at them, enjoy your 23/0  score (hint: BH+SSG+Grenade = gg). The game is not completely finished! but has really tight controls and movement, feels like a solid game, and has lots of potential! Support these guys, they have created a really great hybrid. Thanks alot devs :)\n\n\nFirst off this game is SOOOO much fun! IF! you like twitch based shooters and MOBA esque gameplay smooshed together with a fun simplistic blocky style to it that keeps your attention focused on the action.  <---- If that turns you off, DON'T BUY IT!\n\nYou don't need to aim ahead, there is no bullet drop, quick scoping is a thing, and if your a high speed mofo, who used to love playing insta gib on unreal, playing snipers in this game will be cake, and will net you ALOT of profit.\n\nMAJOR DISCLAIMER: This game is JUST barely out of early access, it's basically a beta right now. Meaning, there are alot of coming soon, and not implemented yet, for different upgrades and such on weapons and armors and what not. It literally says the build is like 0.5#### right now.\n\nthat being said IMHO it is totally worth 5 dollars, hell i would pay ten (provided i have the information i have now after playing it).\n\nGameplay and Asethetics: The graphics are simple, yet convey quite well what's going on, with the glow of weapons giving off an idea of your opponents weapon levels, and armor being able to usually distinguish what someone is wearing, if your willing to get that close. The ability to mix and match armor sets, as well as choose your own loadouts is very satisfying, as you get to compliment your weapon build with your armor build, getting things like +20% or +15% damage. You get to earn resources and craft your gear from blue prints. The progression is very satisfying.\n\nTitan Mode: It starts, you have enough resource to craft one piece of armor, of three that you can wear. Helmet, Chestpiece, Leggings. You have your two weapons, and a extra item, grenade or mini gun turret.\nSo you immiedieatly go out to find your opponents and shoot/stab them to death. Did i mention their is melee!? So much fun.\nYour titans have also spawned and are marching to meet in the middle of the map, you want to go put as much damage on your opponents titan as possible as an early pressure can really hurt them if they are not paying attention. Usually though, if both teams are somewhat competent or decent, or just paying attention. Both titans die quite quickly, then it goes into creep farming phase. In this phase, you want to kill the wee little creeps for crystals (which add +1 to your titans strength) and give you resources to upgrade your armors! (+20% health? yes pelase! 15% MOAR damage?! yes please!). Keep an eye out for the GOLDEN CREEP! when it dies and drops it's ONE golden resource the team to secure this immiedieatly gets +10 strength to their titan. When the timer ends for this phase, then it's back to tians smashing eachother and your (or hopefully the enemy teams) walls and eventually base. That is the game currently.\n\nCurrent Game Balance IMHO: The overall balance is solid, with only a few weapons seeming kind of meh, and everything else feeling strong to use. The two main starter weapons are easily the strongest in the game sans snipers. but that depends on your skill level. Melee is strong, but low skill entry low ceiling, easy to kite.","September 13, 2014","true","17.1"," 442 of 572 people (77%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","77","442","572","22","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigstraw/recommended/214190/","Jigstraw","Jigstraw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigstraw/","175 products in account","Even having only played for a few hours, I can already tell this game has some serious issues that need to be fixed before I'd consider recommending it to anyone. Yes, it's a fun and unique experience, and I hope these flaws are addressed,  but some of the mechanics, while well-implemented, just aren't good mechanics to have. They sound great on paper, but are terrible when put into practice.\n\nI'm speaking of course, of the weapon power up system. When you get a kill, the victim drops a resource that "levels up" your weapon, granting it extra abilities, damage, fire rate, etc. Okay, not that bad, rewarding the player for getting kills. Except these powerups are lost in full as soon as you die, putting you at a massive disadvantage when you respawn. Not only does it reward the player who got the kill beyond the reward of the kill itself, but it punishes the player who got killed beyond the punishment of having died. All it really serves as is a massive snowball effect. The more kills you get, the easier it is to get more. This also applies to the rest of your team. If you're doing well, you'll quickly max out your weapon level, leaving the rest of the power boost resources on the ground for your team-mates. The game becomes easier as you progress not only because you do more damage, but because the enemy player has lost all of their weapon's progress, meaning they can't out-damage you, and the only chance they have of making a comeback relies on you and/or your team making a mistake. Also, it influences what weapons are viable, as you have to actually move to where the victim died to pick up the resource that powers your weapon, meaning sniping is an inferior playstyle that provides no reward. Why even have a sniper if using it is more punishing than rewarding? Not only do you not get a boost to the weapon by using it as intended, but the resource is left on the ground in the open, where anyone could pick it up, whether they're on your team or not. So in sniping, you risk rewarding the other team more than yourself.\n\nFurthermore, most of the Death Match maps I've seen have all lended themselves almost exclusively to close range combat. Cover is abundant, making mid and long range combat a frustrating game of peek-a-boo, as all of the weapons suited to mid-long range combat have such long kill times, the player can simply duck around a corner before you have a chance to inflict a lethal amount of damage, recover their health, and come back, inevitably rushing you and making the  fight a close range encounter. Also, the melee weapons are all absurdly broken, as they're equally as powerful and even stronger in some cases than the projectile weapons, take less skill to use, and are more rewarding, as close range fights make powering up your weapon even easier. That leads to a majority of the players in a match, outside of the bots that fill the empty slots in the teams, using melee weapons as a primary, making the projectile weapons seem like a mere afterthought. There shouldn't be a clearly better option in a game centered around balance and variety. And in my opinion,  weapon's damage output should scale with their difficulty to use, which I don't think is reflected in the game's aresenal of weapons.\n\nMoving on from that, a lot of the game feels very unpolished. When moving around, I've gotten stuck clipping on obstacles that should have easily been walked or jumped over, gotten stuck in walls, titans, and machine turrets, and even just gotten stuck on oddly shaped geometry due to what seems like bad collision detection.\n\nAlso, in pretty much every game mode, be prepared to have your shots completely blocked by team-mates getting between you and your target. I don't think team-killing is possible, but I've gotten killed plenty of times due to a team-mate blocking my shot on an enemy, then dying while reloading after wasting half a clip into the back of their head.\n\nThe game's Titan mode is fun and interesting, but isn't very well explained. I had to figure out the objectives, as well as how to achieve them, through trial and error. The tutorial tells you what to do, but it doesn't tell you WHY you should be doing it. And I didn 't even get to watch most of the tutorial, because I opened a menu in the middle of it, which was impossible to close once it had been opened, and obstructed almost the entire screen, including the "hint" text fields that are meant to provide information about the game. In addition to the lack of in-depth explanation, there are fixed spawn zones in Titan mode that can be outright camped by one or two enemy players, making it impossible for you or your team to collect resources to power your titan, destroy the enemy titan, or  defend your own from enemy fire.\n\nThere's also no visible health indicator in your in-game HUD (I eventually figured out that the more damage you've taken, the brighter your character glows orange, but the game never told me that I should be watching for that) as well as various UI problems, like the in-game scoreboard rarely shows an accurate readout of the match, instead displaying only your own stats, and the stats of the best player from either team, leaving your team-mates readout with a bunch of zeroes,  spite the actual score indicating otherwise. (This has been my experience with it at least. I tend to open the scoreboard whenever I die to keep tabs on the match, and I've seen an accurate, completely filled scoreboard like twice out of more than two dozen games. )\n\nOn top of all of this, every time I close the game, it hard-locks and can't be closed without hitting ALT+Ctrl+Del, opening the task manager, typing the name of the program (Because the blank game window stays on top of every other program you're running, making it impossible to see what you're doing) and hit delete to force close it.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is not bad by any stretch, and has a lot of potential to be incredibly good, in fact. It just needs to have a lot of these glaring flaws smoothed out before that can happen. If you're an optimist, and like the idea of what this game COULD be, then by all means, purchase it. If you're just going to casually play for fun, and not care about whether it's fair or balanced, go ahead. But if you're a competitive player that wants a tactical team-based shooter, don't bother. 90% of the players I've seen use swords, as they require the least skill and provide the most reward. The developers may as well just make a swordfight game mode, then maybe the sword kids wouldn't be such a plague in the deathmatch mode.\n\nIf these changes are addressed in future updates, I'll gladly change my review to be more supportive of the game, as I like the idea of a shooter/MOBA crossover and would like to see it succeed.","January 28, 2015","false","17.8"," 266 of 353 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","266","353","11","14"

It grabbed me and put two blue flaming katanas in my hand and said "See that big ♥♥♥ giant robot right there? yeah, go get 'em tiger!"\n\nI've only played a bit of this, and I gotta say it's one of the more fun Third person shooters out there, all three game modes are pretty damn fun, and the crafting system isn't TOO overboard when it comes to materials needed. Just in the first 30 minutes alone I was able to make my first guns.\n\nThe fact that guns level up as you get kills is really awesome too, it has sort of a gun game feel to it, except you don't feel like you're dreading the next level in gun. Like really, the feeling of upgrading suddenly from one katana to TWO KATANAS is awesome, and slicing people up is just as awesome.\nThe visuals, surprisingly are not as simple as they may seem, everything has a really nice solid feel to it and the atomsphere is still incredibly nice feeling, it's like you take Gears of War and you strip it down to it's base, and stylize that a bunch. I really do love it.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to waste 1-3 hours a day on with friends, or even just need something fresh, definitely pick up this game, it's cheap, it's fun, and it's got lots of charm to it.","September 11, 2014","true","3.8"," 154 of 220 people (70%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","70","154","220","16","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harharinfigar/recommended/214190/","harharinfigar","PWNomancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harharinfigar/","105 products in account","So I bought this game on sale, and it looked really good, but I couldnt play it because my com♥♥♥♥r was a ♥♥♥♥, but now, on my new com♥♥♥♥r, It works fine. This game is really fun, Like, REALLY FUN. I'd say that it's a lot more fun than even Space marine was for me, and as an avid fan of warhammer 40k, That means something.\n\nThere are a few balance issues though. For starters, jumping backwards is the same speed as running forwards, so you know, Melee is really easy to counter. Speaking of that, Almost everything you come across is a counter for melee.\nShotguns, Miniguns, Sniper rifles, Launchers, EVEN SOME GRENADES WHIPE THE FLOOR WITH YOU. Now, I'm not saying melee is impossible, quite the opposite, It's really fun. Personally i'm a fan of the Heal katana, but i dont see it often. It's just kind of annoying when you get someone with a freeze gun so that you cant move, a fire grenade so you cant heal, and a shotgun to sit right infront of you, but just out of range. Speaking of that, I cant figure out which one, But one of the shotguns seems really freaking broken. In three games, this same guy was wielding it, and it ended up deciding the fate of all three games. I mean what the ♥♥♥♥? It has a set spread and high damage and fire rate. Who thought that was a good idea? It doesnt even have a slow reload speed or anything. Once it starts rolling, it doesnt stop, unless you snipe him down, which you cant do because there's freaking terrain literally everywhere.\n\nOther than that, the gameplay really is quite fun. The main gamemode is titan mode, where, when the game starts, you have enough for one peice of armor, and both teams have a titan. Both titans are invulnerable untill they start to fight.\nPretty much at this point you have two choices, Help destroy theirs, or use excessive force to stop them from destroying yours. After either dies, the other goes on to try break two walls, There are turrets that assist you at this point, but the enemies can destroy those. After either has destroyed both walls, they have to break the enemies power core with four hits. When both die, a new phase begins called the creep round, in which you go around killing some creeps for recources for armor and to power up your titan. There are also golden ones, which are really fast and hard to kill with melee (Rip), Which, as you can guess, gives better recourses and boosts your titan even more. As you kill enemies, your currently equipped weapon levels up up to 5 times. When you die, it resets. I'm not sure how the reset is calculated, but i often end up with level 2-3 out of spawning, which is wierd. So armor has three levels and doesnt reset. Armor has really nice bonuses, For instance, i use a centurian armor set, which gives bonuses to yourself and nearby teammates, like movementspeed damage and healing bonuses. it also raises your health by a bunch. All in all, I reccomend this game. it's really fun, but not without it's kinks. I'd say about a 7.5/10.","March 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","45","58","5","9"

It's every bit worth it. Just thought I'd put this out there for those considering.\n\nNow, I've seen a couple bugs. If you're pressing/holding a directional key when a match is starting, your character can sometimes get stuck moving in that direction. I'm talking about with the keyboard here, so I imagine the same issue might be present on a controller (a positive that it's so easy to set one up if you wish).\n\nThe only other problem I've seen is a number of one-sided matches, whether I'm on the winning side or not. This can almost entirely be attributed to how new the game is, however. Everybody will figure it out given some time. FYI the ability to run and gun outweighs the benefits of swords at least in the early/mid game.\n\nDespite minor stuff as above, this game feels like a good shooter, and it feels like a very polished game considering how small the dev team must be. It's graphics are simplistic (or minimalistic, as the title plays on), but still very pleasant to look at, especially when maxed out.\n\nThere's plenty of depth and longevity to the crafting system and progressive power curve in each match. When it comes right down to it, what any MOBA or MOBA-lite needs is solid combat, and this game delivers.\n\nGIGANTIC looks like a great game as well, but to some extent, it feels like Minimum has already accomplished what that game intends to do.\n\nGreat job devs. Anxiously awaiting future updates as this game hopefully continues to grow.","September 13, 2014","true","6.1"," 80 of 119 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","80","119","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wiegraf/recommended/214190/","wiegraf","Wiegraf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wiegraf/","638 products in account","Minimum in its concept is an interesting idea : a third person shooter where, during the match, you weapons evolve as you eliminate AI enemies and enemy players while protecting your own Titan and trying to bring down theirs so that you can smash into their base.\n\nSounds familiar? It is actually as it's a pretty good attempt at mixing the intensity of a shooter with the non-permanent progression found in MOBAs with a few key differences which I'll cover a bit later. It's a game about mobility since you have a melee weapon component which also evolves and armor you can craft that grants benefits while taking away from you at the same time (Want more melee protection? You become more vulnerable to firearm damage, etc.). This makes it so classes are dynamic in that you can mix and match armor parts so you can create a set that fits your playstyle or the current situation in the match.\n\nWeapons usually evolves in 5 tiers, with the lowest tier being your 'basic ' weapon which usually does a pitiful amount of damage. With every player kill, your weapon changes forms and gains new attributes (higher fire rate, more projectiles, additionnal effects, etc.) which makes it perform better. Same with melee weapon, they grow larger, swing faster, are set on fire. Every time you get killed, that progression is lost and you are reset to the weapon's most basic form.\n\nAnd here lies one of the glaring flaw in the game : momentum. A match's outcome is usually decided in the very first minute due to this system as the first team to have a player to do reasonably well will gain weapons that will make matching up to him nigh impossible. Once that player has a foothold, he can usually blast or hack away any enemy without difficulty and, by doing so, ready his armor faster than any other.\n\n"Well, that's what happens in MOBA, right? You level up, gain better gear, kill more." Yes, except that in MOBAs, you aren't reset to level 1 each time you are killed. Add to that weapon balance which favors either very close range combat or extreme long range and weapons like an assault rifle becomes near useless in favor of people constantly running a shotgun, blades or a sniper rifle with the odd few which end up with launchers that will make any semblance of fair play tossed out of the window. A shotgun or blade user will rush you and can blast or cut you to pieces well before an assault rifle will deal enough damage to take them down and a sniper will likely one-shot you from range while your shots spread all over the place.\n\n"But, your armor stays even when you die." It does, but like stated, it gives and takes at the same time; it only helps your playstyle, doesn't directly make you stronger whereas the weapons themselves are the factors that grants a direct power boost. If your armor does, for example, 40 damage and you are given a 15% boost due to armor, the guy which has the tier 5 variant of the same weapon which does 60 damage will still outclass you.\n\nDon't get me wrong; this might actually appeal to people in that they find players who have tier 5 weapons during a match challenging to fight but the problem lies in that this becomes not a contest of skill past that minute but a constant David versus Goliath scenario where David gets constantly stomped unless Goliath flukes.\n\nLevel design-wise, the environnement are quite nicely presented, following the advertised style of having minimal detail. In fact, the style itself is perhaps one of the best point of the game as this simplistic approach makes level interestingly colorful and almost gives the impression of playing in different sport arenas, each with their own theme. This also means the landscape is clear cut and overall easy to navigate while still having enough Z-axis combat for variety.\n\nAnother downside is that despite its simplistic looks, the game tend to require rather capable hardware to run. Though it's possible to lessen the load by disabling a few graphic options, it feels at this point that the game might lack a bit on the optimisation side of things. It's surprising how even with an apparent low polycount for the environnement, the game seems to struggle that much to maintain a decent framerate.\n\nNevertheless, weighting both the pros and cons, I can't recommend this game unless you don't mind the inherent problem of momentum in the game; if that's the case, you might enjoy Minimum but otherwise, you'll find the experience to be frustatingly unfair due to the mechanical gaps created by the evolving weapons.","September 10, 2014","false","0.4"," 662 of 1,114 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","662","1","13","60"

However this game is still being built, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. There's also a lot of cool features that we don't have access to yet, with the promise of "Coming Soon" (such as being able to level up your gun) Even with the bare game I still love the look and the play of the game. For some reason I like the simplicity of shape based maps and players! (it still looks awesome and I feel it's easier to run on my rig)\n\nThe game modes are really cool (Team Deathmatch, Titan, and Horde, a survival Co-op type game mode against enemies/dinos) My favorite being "Titan" where you must get your Titan to the other side of the map whilist enemies trying to stop yours and progress theirs. If the Titans are destroyed you must battle it out for materials which come from "Crystal Spiders" or "Creeps" a bug like creature that just runs around spawn areas, in order to get your titan up and moving again. There's also a golden creep that gives your titan 10 points of power. The power is how strong your titan hits the other? or how much damage it can take? All I know is that the more points that your titan has, the better. The gamemode's very fast paced and the matches last a fairly long time if the teams are even, around 30 mins max. Even though the match lasts so long, I never find myself getting board due to the amount of things/objectives to focus on during the match. If everything is pulled off correctly your team will achieve victory through your titan smashing the enemie's core crystal.\n\nThe weapons are amazing, you can either run around like a ninja or rain down on enemies with your machine gun. Other weapons include, snipers, mini guns, machine guns, shotguns, light sabers, and much more crazy stuff to come. However if you want some extra awesome stuff you've gotta pay for it, and it's quite expensive. You can buy either cool special looking weapons or armour each with their own interesting effects and attributes (for example, a green light saber with the ablility to heal yourself and others around you).\n\nI feel they need to balance the sword more though because of how fast people can get near you and slice you in half(There are amours and Techniques to contradict this!) Each time you get a kill you can pick up a crystal that will upgrade your weapon (you can also get these crystals from friendly/enemies destroyed sentrys) and if you get more than a few crystals then you're maxed out and it makes your gun freaking godlike. It makes other players have to team up against you in order to kill you which is a cool addition to teamwork within gamemodes. Aside from working with your team to get rid of pesky enemies, you can run and jump quite smoothly in game allowing you to avoid gun fire and secure the kill. Last but not least I'd like to say a tad about armour and equipment. Armour can be bought throught the match with materials collected, different armour gives you different abilitys and new armour can be bought with points from playing matches. You may upgrade each peice of armour the same as weapons except armour upgrades don't go away when you die and you may only upgrade armour 3 times to max them out. Equipment can also help a bunch wheather it be a well placed gernade or sentry. You may unlock more equipment simply by unlocking and crafting with aquired points from matches.\n\nI've had a decent amount of server difficulties. Sometimes I'll play a whole match and get a good amount of kills and then at the end it'll say "You've been disconnected" or something as the match score board is up which is really frustrating to a guy that likes to stack up his kills and wins. It'll also kick me sometimes at random times in the match saying "Lost connection to host". Another bummer is that I don't get any xp when this happens so no leveling up.... I don't know if this is happening to anyone else though. It hasn't happened to me to many times but due to the fact that it has happened leaves me cringing towards the end of each match.\n\nI think that anyone whos got a few bucks should try this game out either now while you've got it half off, or later when there's more features and updates to play off of!\n\nI really enjoy this game. It seems like so far you're either going to fall in love with it or completely hate every thing about it. Might aswell give it a try while it's on sale.","September 12, 2014","true","10.0"," 92 of 144 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","92","144","0","1"

The game is VERY highly unbalanced, which normally, wouldn"t be a problem. However, Minimum takes the issue so much farther than it needs to go. The swords (every single one of them) will take a maximum of 3 hits to kill. Combine that with the Knight Armor which increases health by a mind boggling amount, and you're unstoppable. The game itself is fun if you can find a group who are around your level. I don't leave the game a thumbs down because of unbalancing though. My issue with the game at the moment is the way it works. During the tutorial, it says you're invincible during spawn. Nope. Players will idle in your spawn (which there is no penalty for) and spawn kill you with the 1 hit kill level 5 plasma cannon, over and over again. If they're not spawn killing, they're glitching, boosting, or lagging. This game struck me as a masterpiece during development (the earlier stages) but now it is so loaded with trash talking 12 year olds and spawn killing scrubs with +200% health and a 1 shot weapon, that it is unplayable. Wait until full release before you purchase, this game is just not good in its current form.","May 21, 2014","false","2.9"," 62 of 94 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","62","94","0","0"

Minimum on the other hand has changed me from a Steam plebeian into a Steam reviewing sensei.\n\nGame just left early access and still has more content than COD.\nUpdated: 4/9/15\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a multiplayer shooter since Badcompany 2. I was real skeptical at first with it just leaving early access. I've had my share of disappointments with early access games and betas on Steam (shakes fist at Starbound) But I'm glad I made that leap head first into Minimum.\n\nTitan Mode: I get most of my enjoyment from this mode. The smaller maps never leave you with a dull match. This mode is heavily team based, if you're 10x better than the other team but don't work together to kill creeps you're going to have a bad time.\n\nHorde mode:  It's come a long way and is a lot of fun. Not a whole lot of people play is sadly, probably because you can spend 40+ mins playing and the amount of currency squares you gain are minimum. "10/10 pun" but seriously one 13min game of Titan Mode will net you more than a 40min Horde Mode game.\n\nThe crafting system is pretty fun, not too in depth but fun non the least. Each match you start off with enough to make one piece of armor and from there kill creeps and players to build more. Each piece has its own unique set of traits and leveling your armor up is pretty crucial to winning.There are armor pieces you can buy with real money but are just cosmetic and are in no way a (pay to win) cash grab.\n\nAll in all for $9.99 this is a great 3rd person shooter with unique gameplay you wont find anywhere else.","September 15, 2014","true","17.1"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","51","78","3","3"

The menu shows it as 0.0.5-something, in fact.\n\nMany of the menu options are greyed out, and the tutorials take the time to explain how this is because those features aren't done yet. For example, there's a "schematic" system that has you crafting items mid-match, and it talks about building structures and deployables, but the only thing that you can create is armor. Deployables and structures aren't done yet, apparently.\n\nAs if that weren't bad enough, the "titan" mode that the game sells itself on is nothing like what they'd have you believe that it is. My impression, from watching the videos, reading the store page, and looking at screenshots, was that it was somewhat Monday Night Combat-like, with both sides having creeps fighting alongside them, and players defeating the creeps as well as enemy players to power up both themselves and their team's titan, with the objective of ultimately pushing their titan into the enemy's base to win.\n\nThis is not the case.\n\nInstead, it's team deathmatch, even down to the small, cramped maps, where little dispensers along the sides spit out "creeps," tiny cube-shaped robots that do absolutely nothing but arbitrarily wander around. These spawn whenever titans are inactive, and you kill them for "titan powerups" to improve your titan, which is never quite explained in any depth. "It makes it stronger," is about as detailed a description as you'll get. Once you collect enough, the titans spawn, and meet in the middle of the map to fight. The winner keeps moving and tries to break walls down until it is destroyed. This goes on, ad infinitum, until both walls on one side are destroyed, or you get frustrated and quit because the match has been going on for half an hour.\n\nPossibly the most egregious offense, however, was having to create an account and log into a third party service upon starting the game, and then to be greeted with a cash shop on the main menu.\n\nAlso worth noting is that the game is extremely unstable. Matchmaking frequently does not work, inviting friends to parties can return a number of bizarre and unclear error messages, or leave you in an empty party that doesn't even display yourself as a member, and having the Steam overlay open (especially during loading screens) can cause crashes to desktop and graphical artifacts. Often these errors can only be resolved by completely exiting the game and restarting it. Even the tutorial glitches out if you try to use the menu, forcing you to quit the game rather than being able to return to the tutorial or do anything else.\n\nCurrently there are very few maps, even fewer weapons, and tremendous balance issues, which I won't even go into, as they're covered extensively by the other Steam reviews. I would really not recommend purchasing this.","September 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 335 of 580 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","335","580","3","16"

And to be honest, my opinion still stands.\n\nAt this point? Save your money. Trust me. - My inital thought.\n\nWhen I wrote this down and made it public for you to see, this was during the Second Beta Weekend that they had where people could get a code and activate it on steam, and I obviously took part in this.\n\nWhen I first played Minimum, I instantly liked the visuals that they had to offer. The simplistic design is something you will either love or hate. I personally love them, but with the lack of detail it would be understanding why you would not like the visuals.\n\nNow when I first started to play Minimum, I did not know what to think. The game just throws you in without no explanation what so ever, which could be a problem for many new players coming into the game. Without you looking up or knowing ahead of time you would have no clue on what the armor does, or may not even know that it exists! A huge downfall.\n\nBalancing is also a major problem. As you get kills with your chosen weapon, they level up becoming more powerful and more unique. The problem with this is that one or two people on the enemy team can kill you in one shot while you try to kill them with a whole clip. A huge problem.\n\nAt this point, there is only one game mode, that being Titan. Titan being a Team DeathMatch which has an emphasis on killing an enemy titan to get your titan to move up and destroy There titan factory. (Or whatever its called.) You can also power up your titan by killing creep which spawn when both titans are destroyed, adding a MOBA element to a 3rd person shooter, which is quite unique in itself. But that being the only game mode, it can get quite boring really fast.\n\nAt this point, I still say do not buy this game unless you like the concept. However, I would still say that you wait for new game modes, new guns and new blueprints to be added to the game.","May 13, 2014","false","6.4"," 88 of 146 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","88","146","0","14"

It was progressing steadily enough but then the servers went down indefinitely and the entire community was left with a bad taste in their mouth. Come 2016 however, we had news of a revival and in the last month or two the servers have come back up and there are improved features.\n\nGameplayMinimum thrives off high-intensity, action-packed and extremely competitive combat. Whether you choose deathmatch or titan mode, you're sure to have a blast. One thing that makes Minimum stand out from the crowd, is its unique weapon-evolving system. When someone dies, they drop some fragments. Picking those up will automatically add it to your weapon, granting it a more upgraded form and more damage. This is one of the most fun aspects of the game, as you're essentially competing against other players in an effort to not only collect those upgrades, but keep them, because dying will cause you to lose all your weapon upgrades. But that's not all.\n\nMinimum also has a similar armor upgrading system. You have three parts of armor which you can upgrade in a match. Each armor section has different benefits, and once you lock into an armor path, you can't switch it again. For example, if you choose the berzerker chestpiece, you have to continue to upgrade that specific item, and you can't swap it out. However armor pieces can be mixed and matched, so that you can have different chestpieces, boots and helmets. Dying does not cause you to lose these upgrades, so even if the enemy team is somewhat 'stomping', you have an opportunity to shut them down, and beat them with the right upgrades. Each weapon and armor piece has different attributes and abilities, so there's a ton of fun to be had here.\n\nTitan Mode\nTitan Mode is one of the most fun modes I've played in any game ever. Essentially, each team is fighting to get their titan to the opposite team's base. There are a lot of things to empower titans, and seeing the massive struggle happen literally next to you is awe-inspiring and just plain awesome.\n\nCrafting\nThere is a pretty fun crafting system in place, allowing you to create or upgrade existing weapons, items and extras to be assigned to loadout slots. Weapons have a variety of effects and abilities so go wild and explore all that Minimum has to offer.\n\nVisualsThis game, is drop-dead gorgeous. It's like Minecraft or Trove, but without any of the crafting, and with highly detailed objects, environments and items. At maxed settings, the game's environments are sure to leave an impression on your mind, and yet the game is fairly well optimized to run on lower end pc's. The art style seems to be mostly futuristic and it really does this well.\n\nAudioThe futuristic theme does not stop in the graphics department. In fact, the audio is even more so futuristic at times. Sounds in every part of the game are done very well, and combine with the already beautiful environments and interface for one pleasant package. Music is pretty entertaining, though there isn't much on the side of voice-overs; not that this game needs that necessarily.\n\nOther ThoughtsThere have been complaints about balancing items/weapons as well as the cash shop. This is one aspect of the game that I'm watching tentatively to see whether it will be addressed. At the moment, the game feels overall fun and fair in a deathmatch type-environment, but whether some items may be overpowered in a more confined, team-based setting is yet to be seen.\n\nOne thing is for sure, the current developers are actually working to get this game where it needs to be. Right now, I'm just happy to be able to experience the Titan mode once again, as well as the evolving crafting system. I believe Minimum is one of the first modern games to do this right.\n\nA server browser has been added which is a breath of fresh air into the game, allowing people to actually join games on demand rather than wait for matchmaking.\n\nSummaryI never thought this game would return, yet it did, and for what this game offers I'm glad it did. Minimum offers a fun, third-person shooter combined with a very unique upgrade system which makes each match just a little more different than the previous. It remains to be seen how much better this game can get, but the devs have already proven that they are willing to keep their promises, so for that I am willing to believe in Minimum again.\n\n9/10 - Don't play with my heart again devs\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

That's the overwhelming feeling that I'm getting with this. Why did it leave Early Access when the game clearly suffers from serious issues, both optimization and balancing wise?\n\nLet's start with the optimization. I don't know why, but the main menu with the announcements gets very laggy, while the other options that seemingly show more of the 3D world give me a smooth framerate. Which wouldn't be as annoying, if it wasn't the page that everything defaulted to. Especially when changing servers, you'll just get punted back to that laggy main menu. Which, by the way, lags everything else as well. Don't try and pick another server in Steam Overlay when that's going on.\n\nAnd then there's Titan mode. A mode with obvious influences, not in the least with Moba influences where there are creeps to farm that power up your Titan. For people who start out, it can actually get very fun. Everyone's new and barely knows what to do, which means it usually turns into a straight up bout between forces.\n\nBut as I level, I seem to encounter more higher levelled people. And they seem to be wielding a nasty little baseraping tactic. One or two of them with maximum levelled weaponry, shells down the opposing team's spawn point while the others farm the Creeps, attack your Titan or escort their own.\n\nBut you may say, aren't there safezones that we spawn in? Yes, but more often than not, the baseraping happens just outside of there, at points where the team stil gets funneled. Whether or not they're doing it in sight of the Spawn cubicles is irrelevant, really. Even if you try to snipe them, your unlevelled weapon (your weapons delevel upon death) can't hit them hard enough before they can retreat just a little bit and continue what they are doing.\nIn short words: Baseraping is the name of the game, and if you're on the receiving end, prepare to get frustrated.\n\nHorde Mode seems fine, but the difficulty ramps up rediculously fast from wave 4 on. Enemies taking shots from the strongest of weapons straight to the face and still perfectly surviving. That's getting a little rediculous. And with a recent patch that apparently nerfs the rewards for these, I'm not sure I want to play these anymore either.\n\nWhich leaves Team Deathmatch. It's actually one of the better modes to start playing, and seems exploited the least. When more than three combatants meet, it all tends to get pretty chaotic and it seems moderately fun.\n\nBut even that gets soured when you realize that staying in a server is 9 out of 10 times absolutely not a good idea. A bunch of people leave the server as soon as a match is over, and you're stuck for a long while waiting on random people's mercy to join your game. Games will not start until most or all slots are filled (I've yet to actually see a game start where the final holes didn't get filled) I myself got so sick of it, I too started server hopping soon enough. It's the only way to consistently play and also get some rewards.\n\nBut if these holes don't get filled during a match... well, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck then. You can really feel it what team gets the advantage when someone disconnects and nobody fills the gap. In fact, I left a match for that reason, accidentally came back later and saw that autobalance was not a thing. Indeed, 3 v 5 is something that does not get resolved during a match.\n\nRewards are always three types of resources, used to craf weaponry or pay to make specific sets of armor available. Functionality wise, they seem fine, but the menu interface of them isn't optimal either. I was clicking on a weapons picture  (not the equip button) and was hoping to receive some interesting information regarding the weapon in question. Not so, most of the time. A semi blank and obviously unfinished window greets me. If I actually want to learn more about a weapon, I need to go to the crafting menu for it and spot it there.\n\nSome hard statistics would be nice, too. What's the rate of fire? How many bullets are there in a clip? Information like that can only be learned by crafting the weapon and taking it for a spin. Yes, that does mean you end up risking creating a weapon you may end up disliking solely because you weren't properly informed.\n\nThese are all complaints that would possibly get a pass or can be ignored if it was in Beta or "Early Access".\nI don't know, maybe the Minimum devs wanted to force some trust on us by scooting out of Early Access early on, making us think the product is totally worth your time on that basis. That's a wild assumption, but what isn't is that this game is unfinished.\n\nGet on that.\n\nOnce these things are addressed, I'll look into writing a new review that will properly portray the potential fun this game could provide... when finished.","October 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 113 of 194 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","113","194","7","7"

It's just like this game claims to be.\n\nIt blends MOBA and arena shooter concepts in a way that feels seamless, resulting in a fast-paced, highly tactical, and strategically demanding gameplay environment that will leave you with the itch to hunt down any blockman, block-creature, and block-giant in your path.\n\nWeapon balance is pretty decent for the most part, although a few improvements can be made throughout this Early Access period.  The main balance complain seems to be over the katanas, but as of now, there have been plenty of counters and a variety of loadouts that have been able to take on katana users no sweat.  The simplest solution is to backpedal and shoot.  You can also craft armors that give you melee defense, higher speed, or higher jump to easily avoid katana users.  As for ambushes? Well, that's kinda what they are good at, so watch your back!\n\nAs you should expect from Early Access, the content isn't exactly vast and it has its fair share of bugs, but these are highly likely to be improved upon by the time the full release comes since Human Head Studios has proven itself to be making much progress and be highly community-involved.\n\nIf you like games like Unreal Tournament, Loadout, and LoL, then this game is for you.

The graphics are unique and easy to get lost into, it gives a really nice and smooth feel to the game which is nice for gamers looking for escapism. As soon as you get into a match you want to get kills to upgrade you weapon which motivates the fast paced aspect of the game and everyone wants to keep upgrading so you don't really find people camping and sitting around the map. The shop is a really nice feature to the game, you get points which you spend in the shop from killing players in game. At the moment there are a some guns and equips you can buy but I believe the shop can be expanded greatly and it does look like it's in early stage. There are a few maps at the moment but I believe players will become way less bored if they don't get repeats of maps and if there were more maps in the future with unique enviorments like there are now then my love for this game would grow greatly. I reccomend this game to anyone, it's extremely fun and addictive and in an early stage.

On sale at $3 for the holiday, I couldn't resist and gave it a shot. I'm glad I did, because this game is fantastic. It has a nice art style, plays smoothly, is a solid FPS, and has several great modes including a sort of MOBA-lite style, where you protect your titan's running down the middle to battle each other as you kill each other on the field beneath them.\n\nNice selection of weapons. You can upgrade weapons. Craft armor and devices. Upgrade things on the field as you level up and acquire resources (from killing other players). It seems some aspects are still in construct, but there is a lot of meat here, already. This deserves to be the next big multiplayer FPS. Not too fast, not too slow. Not too focused on leveling and progression, but not too stark so as to lose your interest if you're into making progression and ranking things up over time.\n\nAnd again, the art style and the maps. It just looks damn good. If the player base keeps up, this is worth the $10 USD. Otherwise, anything $5 USD and below is a steal.

The mechanics seemed simple enough and we were having a good time but then for some reason I was forced onto the other team away from my friends and that's when the awful mechanics started becoming more apparent.\n\n1: The game is pretty much filled with bots. If there aren't enough players to play, the server will be filled with bots, and to be completely honest, are just kill fodder which will come up at a later mechanic.\n\n2.The whole "MOBA" aspect is kind of forced. You don't really feel like you're accomplishing much by shooting a titan, it does very small damage and kind of feels like you're just powering them up with the creep waves to pit them against each other in a rock-em-sock-em robots match.\n\n3. The weapon upgrading system is broken. It's an interesting idea and I can see why they would put one in to put some semblance of needing "momentum", but there's two issues with what happens that need an explanation. As you get kills against other players, you get weapon power upgrades that go up to level 5 which are lost on death. These power upgrades have differeing effects based on which weapon you're using but the main thing that can be said is that it makes your gun better and do more damage. Now the two issues with this is, one: Bots make it very easy to get these level 5 upgrades and two: certain weapons are VERY powerful at max level. All I needed to do to pretty much steamroll was to get a few kills with a shotgun and then proceed to blaze around the map at insane speeds two shotting everyone.\n\n4. The game doesn't seem finished. I'm not actually even talking about the art assets/models, I get that it's supposed to look minimalistic, but it looks like there's some missing features.\n\n\nAn interesting idea, but really kind of falls apart due to poor design and mechanics choices.","January 11, 2015","false","2.8"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","33","57","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/recommended/214190/","LaggerCZE","Lagger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/","137 products in account","Never thought guys who created Aliens: Colonial Marines would come up with this.\n\nSo, Minimum is a 'Just-came-out-of-early-access minimalistic 3rd person shooter with MOBA elements'. But that description is wrong about what it says: The game is not complete nor really minimalistic. Apparently, it's version 0.5something, and even though the armor system, base gameplay, weapon crafting and devices are generally done, it features only a couple maps, and the planned weapon upgrade system, structures and all the options that brings into the game aren't available yet. It also has a load of bugs, mainly in the UI and drop system, alongside with some sttutering during loading screens and occasional fails to end the program. It doesn't affect the main gameplay too much, though.\n\nThe second lie is 'minimalistic'. That's not what minimalistic really means. Sure, it doesn't have stupid drawings on the walls, nothing is lying on the ground, but the models are just blocky rather than being simple. Funnily enough, that gives the graphics an interesting charm - the blocky Titans, one color ground and upgrades that look like small futuristic car batteries go very well with all the lens flare everywhere.\n\nThe game itself then has three gamemodes: Team Deathmatch, Survival and Titan Mode. But right now I feel the game has actually only one gamemode truly worth playing - Titan Mode. In this particular one, five players on each side are pinned down in a conflict on a simple map featuring one main 'lane' and one or two 'Jungle areas', much like a MOBA would. The 'lane' is where giant robots named "Titans" march trough - meeting in the middle to fight to the death, where the winner may continue on to destroy the enemy's base. Bases are then made out of several parts - Power core, which is what the enemy needs to destroy to win, Turrets, which are your best hope to damage the enemy Titan after it destroyed yours, Spawn Rooms, whch are exactly what they sound like, and defensive walls, an equivalent of MOBA towers, which can be damaged only by Titans, and that usually combo with Turrets to keep the Titans under as much fire as possible. Titans, however, don't fight alone - players can help damage the enemy titan and destroy turrets, while the enemy team must be stopped from doing the same.\n\nBut then, the time comes - both Titans down. Then, the Creep Phase begins. The teams are informed that harmless creeps start spawning in pre-designated areas in the 'Jungle' map parts, where each killed creep drops a powerup that increases your Titan's strengh, making it more probable that it'll win the fight with the enemy titan. Of course, the enemy will do the same - so part of your team should start farming, when the other one should go interrupt the enemy's farming process to cripple them. Alongside with that there is the Golden Creep - faster version of the standart creep with more HP and no restrictions on it's position on the map - wandering around before it gets killed and drops a powerup worth ten times as much as a normal creep's. When time for this phase is up, titans respawn with their newfound strenght and the Titan phase begins once again. Rinse and repeat until the match time is up or one of the sides wins.\n\nThe PvP combat is based around weapons and armor. You can carry two weapons, one of which may be a meelee, one rechargable device, currently limited to several variants of grenades and turrets, and up to three different pieces of armor: Helmet, Chest armor and Leg armor. Each of these armor parts is crafted on the battlefield from armor shards and polygons (see the pun?), and can be upgraded up to level three. These resources drop every time a Titan is destroyed, a Creep is killed, a wall is broken or a player is killed. Each armor upgrade adds a small HP bonus, and also some kind of a special bonus, which in some cases comes with a disadvantage to keep things balanced. These armors come in sets - each with three individual parts, to provide a bonus to a specific playstyle, but you can mix different armor parts to match your personal one. These stay on you even after you die.\n\nWeapon upgrades, however, don't. Every time a turret is destroyed or a titan is destroyed, one blue weapon upgrade is dropped, which you or one of your allies may pick up to upgrade their current weapon by one level. Players, however, drop one upgrade if they don't have a weapon with level three or higher, and drop two of these if they do. Each upgrade increases damage and, beyond a certain differing point, adds the weapon a passive ability. Kills become necessary to have an advantage over your enemy, but with each level over them, the probability of you being focused down because you'll drop twice as much upgrades plus lose all your upgrades increases. This makes the action more dynamic, as you become more and more dangerous the longer you stay alive. Every weapon also features an rechargable active ability - dash, jump, burst fire or super powered projectile.\n\nOver all, I think this game is an idea that got ahead of it's age, but the game is still too uncomplete to be fully judged. Just look at the structure plans - there is one that would spawn weak combat creeps all around to slow down the enemy. I can still recommend it though - as long as you can take the bugs and the darn stupid camera most 3rd person shooters share.","September 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Scroll down for my views during the EAC.\n\nHaving returned to the game and given it a few more tries after it came out of Early Access I can definitely say I would not recommend this game as a purchase at the current moment.\n\nAs mentioned in my EAC review, this game has a whole lot of potential, but that alone is not enough to warrant paying for this game.\n\nBalance issues still exist. Devs and 'regulars' of the community continue to insist that weapons like the Giantkiller and other sword varients are easily counterable. The problem is their view of their own game is pretty short sighted.\n\nThe devs view so far concerning items/balance has been their damage outputs and offensive capabilities of armor and weapons. While that's needed, Minimum is one of those games where any slight change to your potential movement translate to HUGE advantages in combat.\n\nItems like Icarus Pants, swords, shotguns, and berserker pants all have the ability to completely spiral a game out of control.\n\nOn top of balance issues, my main concern has been that most of the items are hidden behind a grind system. Bought the autosniper because you thought it was cool but it turned out to be severly lacking in damage? Guess you're stick with it until you unlock it after grinding your next level.\n\nThere are interesting cosmetic items available to buy (which are a way of unlocking some weapons without leveling) but it feels like just an attempt at squeezing the last few dollars out of the last few dedicated groups of players.\n\nThe devs have spoken regarding this, and they're actually considering making items tradeable/sellable in the market and plan to give them unique modifiers. If that doesn't give you a hint of "pay to win" then I don't what will besides having to straight up buy each weapon.\n\nI initially bought this game in hopes of supporting a great idea from a great dev in the hope the dev would learn from their mistakes. I made this decision even with the knowledge that they were planning to add cash shops and weapon unlocks.\n\nSeeing how the game is developing, with half-baked changes and silly cash grabs instead of real content and consumer-friendly updates, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDoes Minimum have potential? Yes. Is it worth buying at this point? Absolutely not.\n\nI was initially on edge about buying this game (especially early access, which I've decided not to do anymore) but seeing that Human Head Studios, the creators of the Rune series, was making it I decided to make the jump and support them.\n\nThe game is pretty unbalanced, but this can be forgiven as it is early access and it seems the devs are pretty active at updating the game. The art style is hit or miss, personally I love it but I am sure a lot of people will not like it.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential, but other than that it's filled with a lot of balance issues.\n\nThe biggest issue in my opinion is you need to play many games to farm resources and unlock schematics. This wouldn't be an issue if it were for cosmetic items, but to place all weapons, armor, and items under this catagory is a problem. The idea of crafting your items on the fly is a great one, and opens up a lot of posibilities and variation as every item significantly affects your character's abilities and sometimes even your allies.\n\nTo force players to grind out those items puts you at a pretty clear disadvantage if you don't have the time to do so or you buy items that are not currently in the meta.\n\nThis isn't a free to play game (hell even F2P games like Dota 2 don't do this kind of thing) and shouldn't be treated as such. Until the system is changed, I can't recommend this game to anyone who takes competition seriously.","July 26, 2014","false","49.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","3"

It has a classic arena shooter to it almost akin to Quake or unreal with moba esc aspects in the titan gamemode.  Your weapons level up as you kill enemies and pick.. well whatever it is they drop when you kill them.  This isnt for the entire match just until you die. Though some times it seems to retain 1 or 2 of its level ups (weapons max level is 5)  Im not sure what Causes that.  Most weapons seem relativly balanced and easy to deal with if you know how.  I enjoy most of that It makes for a rather solid game.  Its aesthetic choice though not my personal favorite is appealing and simplistic.  The connectivity... was iffy at best.  Some matchs I noticed almost no lag.  Others I couldn't even hit someone At point blank range Because they were NEVER where My client showed them to be this is a huuuge problem and killed a lot of my enjoyment on it.  The game claims to have a crafting system though really its more of a Mid match shop than a crafting system.  The out of game crafting system is again... Basically 2 shops you have to go through to aquire a single weapon.  Which is really annoying.  Yes I do Recommend this game even with my small amount of time playing it though Im not sure how much enjoyment you can really squeeze out of it. I purchased the game while it was $2.50 instead of the regular $10  So I would recommend it for that price.  For the full price I am unsure.\n\nalso the game is not Early access Though it feels like it is.  Fairly few weapons and gadgets makes most engagments feel the same Even the different Variants of swords and shotguns are almost the same weapon save for the special which... well Makes no difference in my opinion.  If the devs add more weapons and gadgets and maybe some more variety with characters themselves It would be worth its full price.\n\nSo for what I paid I enjoyed it for its full price Not so much\n\n$2.50 7/10 would recommend\n\n$10 4/10 Not with current content.","January 28, 2015","true","1.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Personally\nI hope you do the 1st because 90% of the time the 2nd one dries up and gets shut down.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2: If turrents can kill you on there own, without bein manipulated by a player, then they should\ndirectly count as a kill, just as a player can kill you and they get credit for it.  Also I think Missile\nLaunching Turrents with longer range would be a good idea, balance the OP of the missiles with\na slower ROF, and make them expensive as ♥♥♥♥ to get crafting wise.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3: It is going to be extremely dificlut to holp a player base, if level 3+4's keep having to fight\nand match up against level 12 and 16's.  There is no way anyone that low will stand a chance\nwith those kinds of odds agaisnt them.  Try to curb how easy it is to get OP weapons like:\nGrenade Launchers, Plasma Launchers, etc.  Make the most powerful Level restricted to levels:\n10-12 etc for Grenade and so forth. Also keep the same or higher crafting recipes for them.  Lower the Armor Crafting recipes a tiny bit. It feels more often then not that you spend a day or 2 playing just to choose between either an armor or a weapon.  Make lower level weapons much lower crafting recipe wise and make higher recipe weapons much higher.  Also for the love of god please nerf the ROF of the Plasma/Energy Cannons.....way way too often with the AOE/DAMAGE, the game quickly becomes all bout getting them and using nothign else.","July 6, 2014","true","8.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

However, I'm not sure this is a purchase worthy of your time. This game recently came out of Early Access but it still might need a little more time in the oven. The core shooting mechanics are solid, but the supporting features are disappointing. The "crafting" system is really just a specialized currency system that you use to purchase new equipment. Don't expect very much customization here. I couldn't even figure out how to change colors. The deathmatch and co-op survival modes are what they sound like, but the core "titan" mode is confusing. Your goal is to protect your titan while trying to destroy your opponents and their titan, but the strategy pretty much always boils down to a free-for-all. I was getting waxed over and over again. With no real class system beyond your weapon loadout, player direction is really lacking. I was just running around most of the time hoping for a kill and would suddenly find myself sliced in half by a high level player with a lightsaber katana. Whatever...the game is really cool looking and it's got lots of nice weapon effects.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketSHIPlegs/recommended/214190/","rocketSHIPlegs","GoaT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketSHIPlegs/","88 products in account","I feel a little background info on gaming history is always helpful when choosing games so a brief intro.  The majority of my time spent PC gaming over my life has been dominated by Counter-Strike.  I could, and in my younger years did, play that game for 12+ hours a day when possible.  Minimum has many of the same qualities for longevity of interest that Counter-Strike does but in an entirely different package.\n\nThis is one of the most fun multiplayer games I have played, ever.  It's up there with UT99/UT3, Quake 2/3 and it's offshoots, Painkiller, HL2:DM, and while it has many CoD-like qualities it absolutely bests any of the non-WW2 games.  I know I'm having fun when time seems like it's flying; that only happens for me when playing the aforementioned games, running in the forest or cooking in a restaurant kitchen.\n\nThe netcode seems good but I have yet to play with above 80 ping so I can't comment on how it does above that threshold.  The game runs very well and looks good on systems ranging from new-5 years old.  A decent netcode and scalability are things that make or break these games so check that off as approved.  You don't need to change 6 or more settings with console commands to fix the game, it works fine out of the box.  Also, unlike CSGO, the bots in multiplayer are just adept enough to kill an above average player every once in a while and gives lower skilled players a decent challenge while waiting for a server to fill up.  Which, thanks to the matchmaking system, happens pretty quickly.\n\nAll of the maps are enjoyable to play and have resources scattered in heavily traveled areas to encourage engagement on a regular basis.  There have been a few games where the server was full and the majority of the players in the server were camping the far reaches of the map, action was hard to come by then.  For the most part games are near constant engagement followed by either a death or a short recovery/relocation so it's hard to get bored of playing.\n\nThere is a medley of guns and armor to choose from, all with their own intricacies to suit different playstyles.  If you like to run around and just wreck faces you will probably like a combination of Mini Launcher/Beam Rifle/Bullet Hell/Speedy Shotgun/Dash Shotgun with the Ninja chest and leg armor with a Berseker helmet.  All of the sniper rifles are useful in their own way, some are much better after getting powerups.\n\nAs a sniper you're not always in the best spot to pick up the resources before a teammate or enemy gets them so I would suggest avoiding the Rail Sniper unless you plan on being very mobile with it because all you will likely do with it is rack up assists, the Dash Shotgun or Beam Rifle is a good second weapon with it.  All of the other snipers are good for short-term long-distance engagement once you learn how to use each of them to their potential.  You still need to be more mobile than you would be in most modern FPS (CoD) games with a scoped weapon to keep gathering resources to at least give yourself a full armor stack before mid-point in a match.\n\nThe katanas are fun to play with but unless I'm in a server of low-skilled players/half of them are bots I don't rack up near as many kills or have a good K/D ratio had I decided to just use guns.  That said, I haven't messed around with them enough to give a competent recommendation on them.\n\nMaximized guns are a HUGE thing in this game.  10% more damage is no joke, do the math.  You can roll the dice on your 20% chance in crafting or you can just buy them on the marketplace.  A couple bucks will get you every Maximized gun you'll likely want to use and is well worth the price of admission.  I have $60 in CSGO skins/keys and they didn't make me any better at CSGO so this was a no-brainer once I saw them on the Market.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of some of the in-game menu elements.  I often double click on the images only to realize I didn't actually craft the armor.  The symbols for accessing the gun loadout/crafting/store buttons confused me for the first few weeks I played the game, maybe I'm alone here.\n\nThis game is awesome and would only get better with a larger playerbase and more content.  I implore the gaming community to jump on this train.  At $35 for 5 copies you've made 5 people, up to 10 if you count significant others(!!!), happy they didn't spend $60 on a game that has a once-through storyline and about 30-40 hours of multiplayer before you move on to the next half-baked shooter.  Real joy in life comes from accomplishing personal goals and making others happy.  Knock out 2 birds with 1 stone, buy the 5 pack and gift the other 4 to your buds.\n\nIn short:\ngood, cheap game\nbuy a 5 pack\nhave fun\nprofit??","March 21, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As of right now many features are not yet available but that does not bother me at all. Because what is available is quality. I love the stylized 3D graphics. It looks like a badass Tron shooter with just enough moba elements to make it a little different from most shooters. They should have stayed away from the word MOBA though. I know its the gaming buzzword of the decade but it sorta implies the game has lane pushing, rpg elements, deep strategies, which it doesn't. What it does have is double flaming katanas in a dope samurai setting and cool little arena shooter type stuff.\n\nIn the game you attack players, the other team's giant mech and creeps that spawn to power up your own team's Titan. The gameplay relys heavily on kill streaks, with each kill upgrading your current weapon with a new look and more power. Once you are killed you start over again. The animations are great, gameplay and movement are smooth. The crafting system is fun and gives the player something to play for. Adding armor to your character not only customizes your character but gives them stats as well. You can build your character for defense, offense, movement speed, etc.\n\nI'd like to see a mini-map, more levels and some weapon balancing but all that is to come in future updates. Swords are a little over powered but going on a 5+ kill streak with one is fantastic.\n\nMinimum sits a top of my competitive shooter list along with Nosgoth and Hawken. I think many were hoping it would be F2P and complained about the $20 price tag. This game is worth $20 easy. No buyers remorese here.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/PW4DS86trTA","May 26, 2014","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

To compensate for this, I'd actually recommend a way to get rid of old armor which you might have set up for a particular playstyle. This would free up a slot for some mobility or damage boosting armor for another loadout. And while we're on the subject, the momentum side of things could be improved, but the first weapon powerup compensates for this. Whatever weapon you have in slot 1 of the loadout will automatically be upgraded as the match progresses, up to lvl 5 (if you respawn during the 5 seconds your team takes to kill the golden creep on titan mode). This does make it semi-fair, while adding the test of skill: can you outmaneuver your opponent long enough to gun (or cut) them down? For some, comebacks aren't a problem, and others never stand a chance. But I digress. Overall, on a scale of 1 to 10, I'd rate the game a 7-7.5, just because of optimization issues, connection bugs, and the armor sticking with you to the end.","October 19, 2014","true","135.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you are not familiar with SMNC, you should probably ignore this review :)\n\nThis game will not scratch your SMNC itch. There are no classes, just loadouts. You can switch loadouts during a match. There are currently two game modes, and it switches back and forth between them: team deathmatch and Titan. It is the Titan mode that is most like SMNC. In Titan mode there are two giant robots that head from home to enemy base. When they meet, they fight each other. There are also barriers that come up and in the base there are some feeble defenses against titans. Once the Titan defeats the defenses in the base the game is over. So, it is sorta like SMNC... but with a single (albiet giant) 'bot.\n\nTeams are 5v5 and you can leave/join whenever.\n\nDeath comes quickly, sort of like MNC or Turbo. You can build yourself and weapons up during the game with pickups, when you respawn you start that process over.\n\nVerdict: it may be a good game, but it is not an SMNC replacement. Perhaps 10-20% of SMNC gameplay elements.\n\nOutside of SMNC: I was not pulled in by the game on its own merits. There are plenty of other similar games out there, not sure how this is all that different.","August 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I have given it a good few hours but will leave it till a few more patches come in.

Especially annoying when that weapons splash damage affects you\n-the schematics thing seems like an uneccesary complication, you buy a schematic for a weapon then need to craft it - for a game working with the mimimalistic theme it would make sense to simplify that\n-found there were too many resources to keep track of - little cubes for this and diamonds/shards for other things, again needs simplifying in my opinion","January 27, 2015","false","2.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","5"

I would recamend to wait for this game to be relaunched, and once it does buy it, becuase the gameplay is quite fun. some positives and negatives:\n+The designs of the weapons are very nice even though the style throughout is minimalistic.\n+Even though the graphics arent top notch, the gameplay makes up for it.\n+swords.\n+The gameplay: The genra of this  game is basically a moba mixed in with GIANT MECHS. And also guns and swords. It is also a third person shooter as seen in the trailer.\n+The main focus of the game, THE FREAKING MECHS!( and dinos too) Also gorillas are a thing too??\n-Swords. The reason why this is in both negative and postive catagories is even though swords do look awesome essicapply when upgraded and *evolved* They are. SO. OP. But if using the out of place targeting system is diffuclt, then using a combo of sniper rifle and sword is what I would recammend.\n-Matchmaking. Now This one is a bit wierd in my terms. Matchmaking can pair you up with reiduously high leveled opponents, and vice versa. Also The enemy team can consist of people just using swords, which can get quite annoying.\n-usefulness of weapons. Sometime there will be somewhat pointless guns that really dont help at all. For example theres a minigun( I forget the name of it) that had reboudning and boucning bullets, which can also hit your own teammates. Also gernades are kinda point less. This is beucase if your trying to hit someone with a gernade and they happen to have a shotgun(which btw allows you to DOUBLE JUMP!) then they can just jump over the blast. if they are using swords they can dash past the gernade, catch of gaurd and kill you in the process.\n\nLong story short, like many other games Minimum has its flaws and it truly is worth your money. But I would personally hold off buying it until the devs bring it back to the diamond in the rough it was.\nHave a good day.\n\nEDIT: ITS BACK. Its currently in a sort of mini beta as they put it, so once its fully realesed to be purchased  buy it. DO IT.

I kid you not, a game where literally the entire world and all it's characters are made from untextured cubes, the game has framrate issues on lowerend pcs. secondly, on top of that, matches come standard with massive amounts of rubberbanding, and just general lag. players have a tendency to intermitently teleport all over the place (which is made worse due to the fact that there is a dash funtcion on several of the games weapons). at it's worst I had a case where I was in spawn, hit the dash button, and sprint buttons at the same time and started flickering back and forth for about half a second until I remateralized at the center of the map (come to think of it that would be a cool game mechanic. too bad it's just a massive glitch!)\n\nnow that I've touched on the games massive technical issues, there are several game balance and design issue that I feel I should mention for starters the game has a really stupid progression system. basically because the game has moba elements, it has an in match crafting and resource system that acts very similarly to gold farming and item buying in mobas. it's a really neat mechanic IMO. the problem is that there is ANOTHER resource and crafting system OUTSIDE of matches that you have to use to craft the blueprints that you use in match to craft the items! I can't think of any other moba-esque game the forces you to unlock the ability to purchase in match items OUTSIDE OF MATCHES! and for good reason! it's really stupid! admittedly the default blueprints that they give you are pretty good, and it doesn't take much time to unlock all of the rest of them, but it's still unessecary, unjustified, and annoying for new players as it limits their ability to adapt their build.\n\nthere are numerous other potentially game breaking balance issues, such as a sniper rifle that when fully powered up makes it's targets unable to move, which isn't very fun to play against, melee weapons are a bit too strong/easy to use, etc.\n\nTL;DR this game has truely amazing potential, but it's no where near there yet. I desparately want to reccomend this game, but right now it has so many major game breaking issue that I have to reccomend that you avoid it like the plague until they are fixed. I hope that someday I'll be able to take this review down and give this game all the praise that it otherwise deserves.","December 31, 2014","false","12.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

What? Just, what? Furthermore, the game is poorly optimised to the nth degree, and the crosshairs for some of the weapons are disgusting. If that wasn't bad enough, the hitboxes seem a tad screwed while melee weapons at the general fps of the game end up being insanely powerful and a downright clustermug. Good concept, but it needs work. Which is a real sticking point when you claim the game has left early access and has half the features grayed out. I feel slightly misled and very dissapointed.","September 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 28 of 52 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","28","52","0","1"

I believe they are also why some of the maps feel very closed in and overall don't lend themselves to great shooter gameplay.\n\nSome weapons don't seem to offer any benefits over others, for example the cryo rifle looks to be superior to the rail rifle in every way despite the rail rifle having a delayed charged shot that you have to track while charging; it doesn't feel like it does more damage despite increased skill requirements. The grenade launcher seems to be inferior to the plasma launcher in every way. Swords are significantly more useful than shotguns, especially with more useful alt fires to escape with.\n\nMap design is the weakest aspect of the game likely because of the divided focus between shooting and melee.\n\nMaybe if they get things to a more balanced state and make some better maps it will be worth picking up in the future. As it stands it could be a fun for an afternoon diversion but not something you are going to play past that.","September 15, 2014","false","3.0"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

The weapons are balanced despite the claims about OP swords; all you really have to do when someone charges you with a sword is back up, jump continously, and shoot. Obviously they'll kill you in seconds if you let them close in on you, otherwise it'd be a pretty useless weapon. With that aside, the 3 game modes are varied; Horde, being the least fun in my opinion, is your basic how-many-waves-of-creeps-can-you-survive mode; Team Deathmatch is just that with the first team to 50 kills winning; Titan, being my favorite mode, is engaging, fun, and strategic for a game with such simple mechanics.\n\nWhat attracts me most in this game is the reward system: in-game, you have 6 loadouts with two primary weapons available with each, and with every kill you get with either weapon, the weapon upgrades in damage and effect up to 5 levels. However, you lose the level ups upon death. This keeps the game interesting by implementing a tide-like match, swaying back and forth if you aren't careful to stay alive with your upgrades. You collect Fragments and Shards from people, creatures, turrets, and structures that you destroy, which you use to craft and upgrade the armor that stays with you throughout each match; there are many different armor types for you to unlock, encouraging all types of gameplay from Samurai and Ninja armor, meant for hit-and-run playstyle, to Tactical and Olympian armor, meant for a tankier, frontline playstyle, to Disaster armor, for explosives and heavy weapon use if I remember correctly, to several others. Additionally, Minimum is very visually pleasing with all of its vivid colors, especially the increasingly molten glow of your enemies as you damage them. Out of match rewards stem from blueprints and schematics, a system that allows you to unlock all the goodies you want: new weapons, gadgets, and armor for your in-game loadout.\n\nThe only downside I see is in the relatively scant amount of people who play this game (though when a match isn't full/somebody leaves, semi-challenging bots with pretty funny names will take empty spots), which is why I recommend you buy this with some friends you'd like to play with in mind.\n\nAll in all, this is a very fun game to play and it's inexpensive enough that you could convince your friends to buy it and play with you, which makes for a much better experience. My only hope is that this game will pick up speed so that more updates, maps, weapons, and mechanics can come its way!\n","March 15, 2015","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I have a limited amount of time with the game so take it with a grain of salt, but I could really see this as being fun with friends.\n\nIt has three modes: 1-TDM, 2-Horde, 3-Titan\n\n1-TDM is what you'd expect from fps.\n\n2-Horde is also what you'd expect from a fps. It's playable without other people, but I don't think the horde mode will interest you for more than an hour while solo.\n\n3-Titan is about protecting your teams giant robot while it takes out the other teams power core. The two teams titans will fight it out to get to the next stage, bashing down a path, and then smashing the power core. Fairly simple.\n\nThe combat mechanics are simple shoot or smash the enemy and run/jump.You have a primary and backup weapon.  Each weapon has two modes: shoot and special ability. Not all weapons can aim down sights, that's a special ability. You also have a tertiary equipment slot for grenades or turrets. There's an interesting mechanic of leveling your weapons through kills, as long as you can stay alive, upon death your weapons reset. There's a metagame of collecting resources during play to build match-permanent armor, and building weapon blueprints between matches. If you're thinking about trying it out do it. I've seen it on sale semi-regularly. Make sure you pick up the 5-pack for you and your friends.\n\nI've tried half a dozen times to find people to play with. I don't know how many servers are live or when people plays this game. I decided I'd try it out solo style on horde mode, after trying so many times to play with others. The severs seem to hiccup every now and again. I joined a server that had people on it, supposedly, when I got a server error message that rapidly flashed across my screen (not exactly sure what it said other than servor error). At that point I was kicked into an empty server. I couldn't quit that server so after playing a few rounds I decided to ALT-F4. That happened to me twice.","March 23, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As if the devs aren't already getting $15 for every copy.\n\nAs well, the whole weapon upgrade pickup system is a bit flawed. Let me first explain. When you kill someone, they drop a glowy blue block that, when picked up, upgrades your weapon. The problem is: anyone can pickup the block. This means you could be sniping away at one end of the map, but all the blocks are miles away. In a way, this is good because it supports your teammates fighting on the front lines, but you still arent realy getting rewarded for your efforts. As well, you could be fighting on the front lines, get a kill, but have a teammate or enemy run by and pick the block up before you get there. I'll admit, I've done that before, but I still get a little mad when it happens to me :P\n\n\nIn the end, this game is a must buy for TDM-based shooter fans. I hope the devs will tweak the weapon upgrade system a touch, and I don't think the microtransactions are game-breaking (rather just immoral).","February 8, 2015","true","19.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The weapons are balanced despite the claims about OP swords; all you really have to do when someone charges you with a sword is back up, jump continously, and shoot. Obviously they'll kill you in seconds if you let them close in on you, otherwise it'd be a pretty useless weapon. With that aside, the 3 game modes are varied; Horde, being the least fun in my opinion, is your basic how-many-waves-of-creeps-can-you-survive mode; Team Deathmatch is just that with the first team to 50 kills winning; Titan, being my favorite mode, is engaging, fun, and strategic for a game with such simple mechanics.\n\nWhat attracts me most in this game is the reward system: in-game, you have 6 loadouts with two primary weapons available with each, and with every kill you get with either weapon, the weapon upgrades in damage and effect up to 5 levels. However, you lose the level ups upon death. This keeps the game interesting by implementing a tide-like match, swaying back and forth if you aren't careful to stay alive with your upgrades. You collect Fragments and Shards from people, creatures, turrets, and structures that you destroy, which you use to craft and upgrade the armor that stays with you throughout each match; there are many different armor types for you to unlock, encouraging all types of gameplay from Samurai and Ninja armor, meant for hit-and-run playstyle, to Tactical and Olympian armor, meant for a tankier, frontline playstyle, to Disaster armor, for explosives and heavy weapon use if I remember correctly, to several others. Additionally, Minimum is very visually pleasing with all of its vivid colors, especially the increasingly molten glow of your enemies as you damage them. Out of match rewards stem from blueprints and schematics, a system that allows you to unlock all the goodies you want: new weapons, gadgets, and armor for your in-game loadout.\n\nThe only downside I see is in the relatively scant amount of people who play this game (though when a match isn't full/somebody leaves, semi-challenging bots with pretty funny names will take empty spots), which is why I recommend you buy this with some friends you'd like to play with in mind.\n\nAll in all, this is a very fun game to play and it's inexpensive enough that you could convince your friends to buy it and play with you, which makes for a much better experience. My only hope is that this game will pick up speed so that more updates, maps, weapons, and mechanics can come its way!\n","March 15, 2015","true","19.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xhueloe/recommended/214190/","Xhueloe","Skwiggs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Xhueloe/","207 products in account","This game should have the EARLY ACCESS warning because there's a lot of features that aren't in there yet at the moment.\n\nFor a list of pro & cons, scroll down\n\nNonetheless, this is a rather pleasant shooter. The titan mode for example is really interesting, because it blends MOBA elements in different phases, which keep the pace of each round at the highest !\n\nThe in-game weapon upgrade & armor crafting mechanic is nice too, and nicely balanced as far as I'm concerned. Your weapons have 5 upgrade levels, which get upgraded whenever you kill an ennemy (you have to secure the kill to get the upgrade though, which means you have to loot the blue item). I haven't played sniper yet, so I don't really understand how you're supposed to snipe from afar and yet collect the weapon upgrade of defeated ennemies :/\nYour weapon upgrade gets back to the minimum when you get killed, but in order to make it fair, that minimum level goes up to 3 throughout a game. So unless you don't craft any kind of armor, you won't get insta-killed after your first death.\n\nAt the time of writing this review, here's my list of pro & cons:\n\nPros :\nSimple design, yet beautiful graphics & effects\nSolid matchmaking\nGunplay feels nice, and is quite balanced too\nNice variety of maps & guns (would like a few more maps though)\nCons :\nMany features are still lacking (at time of writing), such as weapon customization, craftable devices etc (greyed out, but should be coming)\nSometimes, firing a weapon doesn't really follow your aim (due to the orientation of your character. Might be intended, but is annoying)\nI've noticed that most of the GUI doesn't properly update at times (in-game score tab, end-of-game XP recap, etc)\nThat's about it really :)\nI wasn't expecting much of this game, but got pleasantly surprised ! You should give it a go !","December 30, 2014","true","3.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/recommended/214190/","comradesniper","gr8stalin's mustache!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/","528 products in account","I thought it would be nice to write a straightforward review for those who appreciate it, because a lot of the reviews here so far just rely mostly on hyping up their experience to make the game sound good. Minimum is a fun and solid game, possibly on track to be the next big thing for PC shooters.\n\nHowever, when looking at Minimum it’s hard to find anything terribly unique about the game after playing the games that make up its core. Honestly, it’s just a hodgepodge of mechanics different games: creep farming from MOBA/ARTS/ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S, civilian escort from TFC (payload from TF2), armor tiers from Quake, in-game crafting from RPGs, etc. It’s a very minimalist style of game that still manages to not look like a piece of indie garbage (aka the game has an artstyle instead of just “I LOVE X TYPE OF GAME LET ME JUST COPY ALL OF THE AESTHETICS FROM IT”). It’s a very functional game and has lots of potential to be fun, but it’s just nothing terribly special and I can’t really give it a whole lot of praise for breaking any new ground.\n\n“B-b-but it’s just fresh out of Early Access!”\nRelax.\n\nIn a time where the shooter market is focused mostly on console shooters and CounterStrike, it’s good to see a multiplayer arcade FPS take the scene with the promise of a fun multiplayer experience. The game is very fair in terms of hardware specs and can run on a variety of semi-modern setups. Getting kills and watching your gun go from basic to a beast of warfare makes me grin. There are lots of weapons to choose from but your basic weapons are still VERY viable, and it’s very easy to get the weapons you think might be fun to play with by just playing the game. You can customize several class loadouts for plenty of situations, and there’s a little cash-shop for alternate skins if one so feels the need to grab one to be a special snowflake. The maps are for the most part well-designed: it’s easy to get from point A to point B and figure out the general and some specific nooks & crannies of a map within a single round. There aren’t any particularly terrible parts of the maps that I’ve played where one player has been able to lock down a certain area just by existing. A majority of the weapons are Unreal Tournament/Quake derived (more UT than Quake), and there are old standards and familiar faces returning like a grenade launcher, rail gun, lightning gun, shotgun, plasma, and so on.\n\nIt should be easy to deduce from the trailers and Steam page that you’ll be playing in third-person. It’s got controller support but I can’t imagine why anyone would want to put themselves at that much of a disadvantage for a team-based arena shooter with a twist. When playing in-game, the more kills you get, the more damage you weapon can do and in some cases, the wider of an area of effect it has. You counter this by building into two currently existing armor types (to start): Knight and Berserker. The former is focused on protection and anti-Titan ability at the cost of player speed, and the latter is focused on dealing damage and brawling other players at the cost of protection and health. Using these armor types, players have to work together to keep their Titan safe while doing whatever they can to destroy the other team’s Titan. When both teams have their Titans destroyed, the game goes into a “creep farming” phase where both teams hunt small creatures for personal resources to upgrade their weapons and armor, while each creep kill boosts your Titan’s power. There’s a Golden Creep that gives a very large bonus to a Titan’s power, and it can keep the field even if a team lacking in creep farm grabs it or be the key to victory for the dominant team.\n\nHowever, there are some problems that plague Minimum. As with any game that has some element of MOBA/ARTS/ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S in it, it’s easy for one guy to feed the other team and let them climb the armor tiers a lot easier (one game I played just recently had me and one other guy with 2+/1 KDR while the guy at the bottom of our team was 2/35 and it took us an age to move forward). It’s also easy to just have everyone completely forget about killing creeps and just have underpowered Titans keep brawling each other; conversely, it’s also easy to have one team completely remember and the other completely forget and have a super-fast game.\n\nThere are quite a few connection issues with the game because there are a lot of moments where I end up thinking that the game is peer2peer. Rubberbanding is prevalent everywhere, but most commonly with those who end up dashing around with melee only. This is generally frustrating because someone will just hold W into you and you’ll shoot him, and suddenly he’ll stretch behind you and you’ll miss that one shot needed to keep yourself alive. It’s probably the biggest issue I’ve got with the game so far because it’s really easy to abuse with the Taser Shotgun, which will segway into the next paragraph.\n\nIn terms of complaining about balance, I’m not a fan of movement-impairing effects. I haven’t had any problems with anyone using the Cryo Rifle, but the Taser Shotgun is simply frustrating to play against. It goes against the arena shooter maxim of having freedom of movement and is a carry-over from the MOBA/ARTS/ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S themes of the game. I also am not a huge fan of the deployable player turrets because it’s particularly easy to deploy any time (beginning, middle, end) during a fight and at the very least make the job of a teammate getting an avenger kill for you that much easier.\n\n“B-b-but they’ll patch it!”\n“G-g-g-git g-g-gud!”\nRelax.\n\nLike any other multiplayer or co-op game, Minimum is best played with friends. I wouldn’t mind seeing a LAN option or true private server option in the future, and by the looks of it Minimum can have a bright future ahead of it. I just hope Human Head Studios doesn’t fall to the cries of the majority begging for melee-only hold +forward to win or some other vocal group. I also hope that those XP-based mod slots on weapons don’t become a thing. I really hope they don’t. I hope Human Head Studios learned from the mistakes of Loadout. I really hope they did.\n\nAll in all, even though I can’t really praise Minimum for setting any standards or breaking any new ground, I would recommend Minimum if you’re looking for a new yet familiar experience in the shooter market. I'm ready to see how Human Head Studios keeps Minimum going, and I hope it's in a good way.\n","September 14, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

The game is a twitch shooter but there are many different weapons you can customize to fit your play style. It has minecraft-like art so the design is really minimalist. It mixes fast 3rd person shooter action with MOBA elements you would see in games like League of Legends, Dota, etc.\nSo far, I'm loving the game and I hope the devs continue to support it, but so far it seems as though they are rolling out the updates and bug fixes (but there is still a lot of progress to be made).","September 29, 2014","true","43.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There's just so much missing.\n\nI was suprised to find out out how much this game really lacks when it comes to it's features. Basic stuff like soundeffects such as footsteps is screaming with their lack of pressence. As of writting this it seems they have lately put out a fair amount of updates with a hint about keeping the pace up. I hope that is so because this came have a huge potential if it gets the attention and love it needs.\n\nRight now you are tossed into a minimalistic world with customizable loadouts where you run around fighting, gaining rewards and as the match progresses you use the rewards to craft armour. Each kill drops a powerup that strenthens your weapon up to five times. All lost each time you die though. At the same time you use 2 different pickups to create on the spot new armourpieces and upgrade them.\nThe weapons have two firemodes. Depending on which weapon secondary might not even be an attack. There's a shotgun that has a highjump skill as secondary that is excellent to get out of fights or evade enemies. Meleewise you get a sword from the start that has a dash on secondary and as it you power it up it goes from one single boring plain stick to a dualwielding glorious flailing wall of death. All that seems really fun and proves the developer aren't afraid to break the classic mold of run'n gun shooters so we might see some awesome stuff in the future.\n\nBesides primary and secondary weapons you also have a slot for a device in the loadout. Here you equip grenades, turrets and mines. Not to much options yet but so far all I've tried have been useful and served it purpose.\n\nWhen it comes to gamemodes there are as of writting this three to pick from.\n-Team deathmatch, just as basic as it sounds really.\n-Horde mode, coop battling against waves of bots which seems a bit unbalanced and strange as bots can spawn on top of you. Clearly far from done.\n-Lastly we have the Titanmode. this is the gamemode held up as whats it all about. Two teams fighting against eachother over creeps to strengthen their titans and have it push into enemy base for victory.\n\nWith all this said and from what I can see in the interface I really hope this game can get it together and accomplish its goals. But I wouldn't recommend it as a must buy for anyone. Only those interested in seeing a game evolve should really buy it as it is now. Is it fun? Yes, but it is so incomplete and lacking in features that it really is for curiousity and willing to support you should buy the game. Not to actually play it. Better not burn out on it now and get to have all the funs later when it is more fun to be had.","September 6, 2014","true","9.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.\n2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).\n\nPrepare the cookie dough layer:\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).\n4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.\n","February 28, 2015","true","11.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","5","8","10","1"

Yes, if you're caught out of position by a sword-wielding opponent, you're dead.  Launchers are excellent on small maps where players tend to bunch up and are vulnerable to splash damage.\n\nOn the other hand, if you pay attention to enemy positions and fight at range, swords are useless.  If you stay out of big melees and work the angles, launchers can be countered.  If there's any area where there are balance issues, I'd say it's in the armors.  A big portion of the armor selections are next-to-useless.  Which would you rather have: a helmet that gives a 5% damage bonus for shotguns and rifles, or a helmet that gives a 5% damage bonus for you AND all your nearby teammates for ALL WEAPONS?  Could use some tweaking.\n\nStrategy and teamwork are very important in this game.  Combining weapon loadouts that synergize, and choosing the right armor can make the difference between a useful loadout and one that can't get anything done.  I really appreciate how leveling up and unlocking new weapons and armor opens up new styles of play, while the starting weapons and armor never stop being useful.  Sticking together with your team is critical, as it's almost impossible to win a two-on-one fight (if your opponents know what they're doing anyway).\n\nThe map design is great.  Mobility and positioning are a key element of strategy, particularly on Titan maps, which have opportunities for sword ganking, sniping, and everything inbetween.\n\nPersonally, I've been waiting for a game to attempt this kind of art style for a long time.  It's very reminiscent of Mirror's Edge, so if you like the visual style of that game, you'll enjoy the look and feel of Minimum.\n\nThat said, it really shows that the game is still in development.  There aren't a lot of servers, the automatching often puts you on servers with no players, I've exprienced some audio/visual bugs, and I'm pretty sure the "Pickup Hell" weapon, that claims to make creeps drop more items, doesn't actually do what it says.  On one of the Titan maps, I fell into a crack and was stuck until an opponent killed me (The Event).  I would like to see more maps, of course, and I feel that the Horde mode would be more fun if the difficulty level didn't ramp up quite so fast (I haven't seen anyone make it past the third wave without heavily exploiting the enemy AI and level design).\n\nOverall, a really fun third-person shooter that, I hope, will continue to improve.  It's $10 US, so buy it if you're sick of CoD.  What do you have to lose?","October 16, 2014","true","28.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Enemy teams user level was 5+ while my team was 3 or less. Felt like Call of Duty matchmaking.\n-Melee weapons might need a nerf or ranged need a buff. Many times I peppered an enemy just to have him walk up to me and cut me down in one swing.\n-Only main game mode (Titan Mode) is avaliable.\n\nFor a while I enjoyed it. The game is fun but what turned me off from it was how the handle the player drop in system. Its very counter mobaish but it made no sense to me. In one game a large amount of people just quit out. Which left the game 3 v 4 (my team having the 3). I go along play against the heavly leveled stacked team. Learning the trick to toss a grenade straight down to kill them off after they cut you in half with one swing. I then take a look at the scoreboard. It turned into a 3 v 5! How the hell does that happen?! No one joined my team at any point. I was always waiting for that balancing player to come in and help the team out but that never happened. It was depressing.\n\nMaybe down the line I will give it another try, but as of now.

Each team has one titan, which respawns shortly after death, and it's up to each team to defend their titan, while attacking the other, in the hopes of pushing their titan towards victory. It's a dynamic variation on the 'ARTS/MOBA' formula.\nThis game style works great, and is a tonne of fun but there are a few issues that need to be brought up.\n1. Nobody likes to communicate in this team game where co-operation is nearly always vital to victory.\n2. The game gives you the opportunity to get kills (which lets you upgrade your weapons and equipment while simultaneously getting score), or focus on killing or upgrading the titans (which lets you win the game). Being a video game, played by imperfect people, people often focus on getting kills instead of winning the game.\n3. It's really quite irritating that a player needs to grind to try out new things, and considering the fact that the balance can often end up wonky, it feels like Minimum asks for too much time.","January 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My views on the game would remain the same, however.)\nTo sum up my opinion: Although much of its content remains unimplemented, Minimum currently is a robust game that is quite well made and enjoyable to play. Be aware, however, that you will have to make an account with the game in order to play (or, at least, it was required at some point in the game's life).\n\nI bought this game shortly after it came out of Early Access, as it sounded to me like it kept the elements I enjoy of MOBAs while adding in the aspects of team-based shooters that I enjoy more. And, for the most part, Minimum does so.\n\n-What exactly is this game?\nSort of a cross between the standard MOBA and TF2, in my experience. There are three gamemodes, Titan, Deathmatch, and Horde. Horde can be somewhat confusing and is geared towards co-op (perhaps a bit like Mann vs. Machine in TF2) while Deathmatch is the standard shooters game type. Minimum's main uniqueness comes from Titan mode, a 5v5 format where each team attempts to activate and protect their Titan mech as it battles the enemy Titan and breaks through enemy defensive walls, eventually shattering their base to win the match. Although each Titan has a massive amount of health, players are able to deal noticeable amounts of damage to them if left unhindered, so each team will usually be fighting one another while the Titans are battling themselves. After both Titans have been destroyed, each team begins collecting charges by killing creeps located between the team bases. Whichever team obtains more charges for their Titan has an innate advantage in the next Titan battle, or 'Clash'. Games can last varying lengths of time depending on how many Clashes are required to break the enemy base, but in my experience they are usually on the order of 10-20 minutes, possibly 30 on the outside, similar to a round of Payload or Attack/Defence in TF2.\n\n-What do I do in this game?\nMainly, players run around and shoot Titans, creeps, and each other. There are no set classes, but as is common in shooters, players set loadouts of weapons and gadgets before matches and then may quick-swap while in-game. Also, there is an armor system- each player can craft a head, torso, and leg armor from materials dropped from various sources or found around the maps. These armors usually grant either a situational bonus, such as increased speed at low health, a weak all-around bonus, such as reduced bullet damage, or a strong bonus paired with a potent downside, such as significantly increased health but much lower speed.\nThe weapons are mainly what you would expect in a shooter- sniper rifles, shotguns, assault rifles, miniguns, and launchers, along with melee weapons in the form of swords. There are some interesting subtypes of these weapons, however- for example, their are shotguns with forward dashes or high-jumps as altfire options. Another of Minimum's important systems is the weapon upgrade mechanic- every killed player, and certain other entities, drops an upgrade part. Picking this up increases the power of the currently equipped weapon, up to five times if I remember correctly. Most or all of these upgrade levels are lost on death.\n-That sounds somewhat unbalanced for some players to have powered-up weapons and others not in a shooter. Also, aren't those melee weapons overpowered, like many have said?\n\nOccasionally, yes, but in my experience most times good aim and possibly suprise can take out any player, even if they possess a maxed gun, as they will still have roughly the same health as any other player. Yes, they have an advantage in drawn-out fights or in ambushes, but when they die, they feed that advantage to other players. And in their own respect, katanas are fairly reasonable- it takes several swings to kill another player, and should they escape out of range, you are extremely vulnerable, as the distance-closing dash on the basic katanas has a recharge time. Shotguns especially are highly effective against melee enemies. As is often the case in multiplayer games, if the teams are heavily imbalanced or if every person on one team is using the same weapon, things can become annoying and unfair, but most of the time, Minimum is as balanced as any other team-based game.\n\n-How are the graphics?\n\nAlthough not intensive, Minimum has some beautiful visuals, in my opinion. As the title might suggest, they are often minimalistic, but they come across much as the best pixel art does, vibrant, elegant and clear simultaneously. The colors are quite nice, the Titans look great, and the weapons and projectiles all match the art style well. Character movement and reload animations are perfect most of the time, and are animated in substantial detail. And, each map feels unique, with its own movement lanes and seperated levels, paths and flanking routes, and eye candy, such as Japanese designs or industrial machines. The only real problem I have is that the player characters are rather empty, being just pure white cube people, until armor is equipped, after which they look somewhat more detailed.\n-Final Notes\nMinimum has a reasonably long-term item unlock mechanic, where each completed match earns you XP and resources. Each time you level up, you may unlock one new item blueprint, which can be crafted with enough resources. Without playing all that much, I have unlocked enough weapons to enjoy myself, but it takes quite a while to unlock everything. For the most part, you may not purchase resources with real money, so it is mainly fair to all players, although it seems that purchasing a reskin of an item with real money may grant the item, even should you not own the normal version.\n\nAt least at release, Minimum required the creation of an account with a back-end manager called Mber, which syncs with Steam and does not require much attention beyond initial setup.\n\nFinally, many of Minimum's future mechanics, such as weapon modification, are not implemented yet, even though the game is out of Early Access, the daily tasks and menu screens could still use some work to function better, and, at least for me, the game occasionally crashes when attempting to exit. However, the devs have shown consistent support of their game and have continued implementation of the content they have promised, and have repaired many of the bugs since the game's release.\n\nEspecially at 75% off, I would highly recommend Minimum as an enjoyable, well-made team shooter with much potential.","January 27, 2015","true","21.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is when it becomes unbalanced. The more experienced players tend to work together rather than running solo. This ends up making the the newer players having a difficult time being able to compete. In the end, the newer players get pushed back into spawn until they all move out together which often end up killing the geared experienced players. Several times me and my friends almost beat the enemy team in the first titan clash where we would usually break the first wall and do some damage on the second. We all knew what to do and how to start off while the other team didn't. You can solo pretty well, but if your team isnt working together, you will often loss.\n\nAs for the swords being overpowered, it is both true and false. Swords do great amount of damage but their reach is somewhat short. To counter this, just carry a loadout with taser shotgun or cryo sniper, this is a perfect counter to all melee users. One or two shots will stop them in their place, keep your distance and finish them off with another weapon, the slow effect last about 4 seconds  which is enough to finish them off. You could also just stay near a friendly turrent which can be used as a decoy to distract the enemy and finish them off.","October 25, 2014","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although there is a nice variety of choice for melee and ranged weapons, it's only once you begin to observe the interaction through playing the game that you start to notice the problems with balance.\n\nFirstly, although the swords are a nice edition it makes the gameplay in multiplayer somewhat frustrating as there is little balance of ability to defer a sword attack if you have a ranged weapon, especially with people spamming the jump button every second (I will return to this point). The problem you get particularly with this is that you will damage a sword wielder to close to their death but with all the hopping around they do, ultimately they will run around an object that covers them before running back out with recovered health and quickly spamming to kill you.\n\nThe second major problem stems from some of the purchased armour which to an extent makes parts of this game "Pay to win" wherein I have seen people buying outfits to make them jump higher over and around players with large weapons making them very hard to hit and avoid their attacks due to their ability to jump far higher than any other average player, this is a serious problem in terms of combat balance in multiplayer as it means that not only can they jump above you and kill you faster, but it also means that they can escape to areas you would not be able to access as easily yourself without paying for the same privelege of armour.\n\nBar this the gameplay is very fun and engaging and there is a lot of potential for great things once player balance is focussed on a little more.\n\nCurrently 5/10 with potential to be 8 or 9/10.","September 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have recommended this game to several of my friends. This is a cheap shooter game that stands out from other games such as CoD and BF simply because it's a geometric-like game. A game can have blocks without being compared to Minecraft, so let it go. The developers chose to do this sort of art style most likely for two common reasons: They wanted to stand out and they wanted to spend more time on the engine. The game runs very well on my computer, the servers are 90% reliable, and there are many more features that are currently being implemeted in the game.\n\n[MICROTRANSACTIONS]- I'm sick of them, you're sick of them, he's sick of them.. who isn't? The developers have cut the price of the game from $20 to $10. They need the extra cash. At the time of me writing this review, they are purely cosmetic aswell. Each "cosmetic" item in this shop has an equivalent that can be obtained by playing the game.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]- I love this game. It runs so smoothly! I was amazed that the game was actually exactly how the trailer showed. I have enjoyed a couple of hours playing this game and I play on spending many more. It's like a mixture of Call of Duty, Titan Fall, and League of Legends.\n\n[GRAPHICS]- The game is pretty. It's not meant to have top-notch graphics, the developers wanted to make a fun game that's really cheap and can run on computers that are in mint-condition.\n\n[IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS]- Some weapons are clearly better than others. Anyone that has played Minimum for at least 15 minutes can honestly say that the swords are too op. I believe that swords should be at least half of the power that they currently have. I have purchased the grenade launcher and the fork launcher, I believe that the launchers should get at least a 25% speed buff because anyone with the starter weapons can kill you more efficiently. To get a kill with these weapons, you need to basically steal someone else's kill! I feel awful doing it so I stick to starter weapons most of the time.\n\n[MOST IMPORTANT SUGGESTION]- If I had to choose one thing, I would ask if the drops from players can have a 3-5 second shield on them for the killer because figuratively speaking, 75% of the time some dude with a sword rushes my kill and takes the drops.\n\n[ENDING THOUGHT]- In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games such as Dota, League of Legends, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Gears of War.","September 18, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunToxx/recommended/214190/","sunToxx","sunToxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunToxx/","253 products in account","Review: Alpha State and Focus on Low Skill Kills\n\nFirst the good things. The game's graphics are, at least for my taste, very nice. And the low poly design, along with some more optimizations, could allow this game to have very low system requirements. It's potentially the only recent shooter i could run at a constant and stable 120fps/hz.\n\nA little downside here, the game seems to be locked at 90 fps, which is a bit sad in times of 120Hz monitors. Probably an engine limitation, but most likely one that could be changed. Maybe even in the config files if one looks for it.\n\nAlso, the combination of a shooter with a moba, is extremely nice. Huge addictive potential here. The Titan game mode is spot on and could even survive as a single gametype in a shooter.\n\nUnfortunately, that's already all good there is to say for the moment. So now to the weak sides.\n\nFirst of all, they claim to have left early access. But this game is not even in Beta stage. In a Beta, most of the features are already there. In this game most feats are still placeholders. So what we got here is an alpha build.\n\nThe game's weakest point is, unfortunately, the combat part. Everything you found in the past 10 years in serious shooters, that was counted by top players as skill free, honorless or plain trolling, is what Minimum promotes at the moment.\n\nThat the weapon sounds, like the AR, sound like pea shooters, could be forgiven. But that the strongest "tactic" ingame is, to bunny hop (10 meters high, and nonstop) while spamming grenades (non stop), is ... well, i lack the words to put it in a nice way. It seems to be a bad joke, and one wonders how old the devs of this game are. Serious combat looks different.\n\nNext worst thing is the amount of melee in this game. An honorful melee kill is one where you sacrifice the chance for an easy kill, to get a cool kill with a melee weapon. In Minimum however, you get super speed, insane dashes, selfheal and whatnot, to get free kills.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you rack up insane numbers of kills this way. But it means that you get a lot of undeserved kills. Which is never a good thing in a game, because that is what makes a lot of gamers move on to other sources of entertainment. Very bad idea when you are trying to build a playerbase. One of the worst ideas in fact. So your main choices now are, to also go the crappy way of melee in a shooter. Or increase your armor, and thus becoming slower and slower...\n\nThe developers cleary point into a for me very strange direction. Instead of promoting proven to be addictive shooter combat, they degrade this game to a sort of hack'n slash'n spray'n spam fest. It's fun for a short while, but gets boring rather fast.\n\nBut this most likely strongly depends on what type of game player you are. If you are not happy by dominating through the use (or abuse) of certain game mechanics to gain an advantage, then this game is defenitely not for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if all you need to be happy is rack up kills, no matter how skillfree or honorless, then this game has a whole lot to offer. It basically combines all those mechanics that are frowned upon in serious matches in one game.\n\nAlso, one thing that i find very worrying, is an option in the menus. The game seems to support gamepads and has options for aiming assist. This is an absolute no-go in a shooter on pc, and i hope they will make sure that controllers do not even come close to the accuracy that can be achieved with a mouse. This would be almost as bad as officially allowing aimbots.\n\nKeep in mind though that this game appears to be in early alpha still though. So a lot can still change. And spending 5 bucks for it on a Steam sale is certainly not a mistake. Not only because some good laughs can be had, but also to give the devs more time to fine tune this game. This game could be very long term addicting and lure out of lot of cash out of peoples pockets for skins and the like if it were more serious.\n\nOne thing that would be very nice to see, if the general direction this game seems to go is maintained, would be if in the stats the different types of kills (shot/explosives/melee) would be visible seperately.\n","September 19, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But nevertheless the game still has a lot to offer at this point and will only continue to grow.\n\nThe art style, game modes, weapons + weapon customization (only a bit of customization), controls and gameplay are all really fantastic. I have a blast playing the two modes they have in game currently which is the titan mode and the team deathmatch mode. The only thing I'm fearful of is microtransactions. I have not looked up if they are going to add microtransactions but just by the way that you buy weapons which is the these little cubes that act as currency, I can't help buy think that they may add it.

A bare minimum game without any high resolution details or environments because it doesn't need them. On it's own it already outshines other titles of the same genre. With objectives and game modes so simplisitc all that needs to be done is grab your gun and run into action. Titan Mode pits two mechanical behemoths against one another as players run around collecting crystals to help stengthen their massive ally all while blowing away the opposite team in blocky destruction. Customizable loadouts, armor selections and schematic crafting add to strategy and overall enjoyment.\nMore than worth the money and with future improvements already on the way, this can only get better.\n\nA few suggestions for the devs\n- Implement a proper level matching system. Basically pitting players together of the equal level and skill.\n\n- Block off spawn containers once a player exits them. Too many people exploit the invulnerable aspect of them and shoot others while protected. Or at least prevent shooting from within them.\n\n- Lower sword melee damage. Base damage on swords seems a bit OP for single blades, dual blades can be an exception.\n\n- Armor crafting should be a sperate loadout option same as weapons. This can allow players to know what they want ahead of time and not hold up their teams with decisions. Armor leveling should be done at the respawn screen.\n\n- Tweak gun accuracy\n\n- Add interchangable mods to weapon loadouts","June 3, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

This game is borderline BROKEN. Well first, this game is fun BUT ONLY WHEN PLAYING HORDE MODE!!! Horde mode is really the only mode that doesn't have Level 5 Katana rushers charging at you every minute. Katanas are what breaks the game.\n\nReasons:\nLevel 1 Katana takes 3-4 strikes to kill.\nKatanas make you impossible to hit especially when the frames are down, but I'll ge to that.\nKatanas give you a speed boost.\nWHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!?!?! Absolutely not! How I think this situation should be remedied. Katanas give you a -30% health detriment. No speed bonus. (Why would you need a speed bonus when your katana has a built-in dash function already?)\n\nOkay, I think I've covered the Katanas. Now onto the snipers. VERY, VERY HARD. Do not come into this game thinking you'll be blowing robot's heads off left and right. No. The headshot hitbox is TINY. Honestly, come on. You're zooming around the battlefield at 30 MPH and the hitbox is literally the size of the head, which I get, because why should you be able to kill someone with a headshot when it would normally go right past their ear? Well, it's impossible to hit. And snipers take 2-3 shots to kill.\nHow to remedy: Snipers get a 40% faster rate of fire. PLEASE IT IS SO SLOW. Second, Make a sniper 1-2 shot kill. Third, expand the headshot hitbox.\n\nOkay, now those frames I was talking about.\nMy computer is overkill when it comes to this. Specs: Processer-3.16ghz Graphics-Radeon HD7790. More than enough? Yes. Soo, why am I getting choppy frames? I can play Battlefield 3 at 60FPS on Ultra, and this simple graphical game can only run at 30 fps avg with 10 fps frame drops? C'mon... I think this should have stayed in Beta a bit longer to smooth out these problems.\n\nI wouldn't advise buying this game until a patch comes in because you'll just end up screaming and throwing your mouse at the wall.\n\nBut it is a fun game, just really, really, broken!","September 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although there is a nice variety of choice for melee and ranged weapons, it's only once you begin to observe the interaction through playing the game that you start to notice the problems with balance.\n\nFirstly, although the swords are a nice edition it makes the gameplay in multiplayer somewhat frustrating as there is little balance of ability to defer a sword attack if you have a ranged weapon, especially with people spamming the jump button every second (I will return to this point). The problem you get particularly with this is that you will damage a sword wielder to close to their death but with all the hopping around they do, ultimately they will run around an object that covers them before running back out with recovered health and quickly spamming to kill you.\n\nThe second major problem stems from some of the purchased armour which to an extent makes parts of this game "Pay to win" wherein I have seen people buying outfits to make them jump higher over and around players with large weapons making them very hard to hit and avoid their attacks due to their ability to jump far higher than any other average player, this is a serious problem in terms of combat balance in multiplayer as it means that not only can they jump above you and kill you faster, but it also means that they can escape to areas you would not be able to access as easily yourself without paying for the same privelege of armour.\n\nBar this the gameplay is very fun and engaging and there is a lot of potential for great things once player balance is focussed on a little more.\n\nCurrently 5/10 with potential to be 8 or 9/10.","September 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is when it becomes unbalanced. The more experienced players tend to work together rather than running solo. This ends up making the the newer players having a difficult time being able to compete. In the end, the newer players get pushed back into spawn until they all move out together which often end up killing the geared experienced players. Several times me and my friends almost beat the enemy team in the first titan clash where we would usually break the first wall and do some damage on the second. We all knew what to do and how to start off while the other team didn't. You can solo pretty well, but if your team isnt working together, you will often loss.\n\nAs for the swords being overpowered, it is both true and false. Swords do great amount of damage but their reach is somewhat short. To counter this, just carry a loadout with taser shotgun or cryo sniper, this is a perfect counter to all melee users. One or two shots will stop them in their place, keep your distance and finish them off with another weapon, the slow effect last about 4 seconds  which is enough to finish them off. You could also just stay near a friendly turrent which can be used as a decoy to distract the enemy and finish them off.","October 25, 2014","true","54.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you feel like reading one with more content though head over to  RealGamerReviews  [realgamerreviews.com]\n\nNOTE\nThe game has been updated twice since my review was posted, and some of the things in my review actually got addressed. This includes some server issues, weapon maximization, deployables and structures (although the last two are only available in horde mode for now).\n\nOverall Impression\nThis is a great game once you get past the short comings of weapon balances and the sometimes poor server connections. The weapons, despite their balance issues, are fun to use and there are several varying weapons to choose from. Titan mode now feels like it has actual depth and also promotes teamwork much better than its first itteration.

I have recommended this game to several of my friends. This is a cheap shooter game that stands out from other games such as CoD and BF simply because it's a geometric-like game. A game can have blocks without being compared to Minecraft, so let it go. The developers chose to do this sort of art style most likely for two common reasons: They wanted to stand out and they wanted to spend more time on the engine. The game runs very well on my computer, the servers are 90% reliable, and there are many more features that are currently being implemeted in the game.\n\n[MICROTRANSACTIONS]- I'm sick of them, you're sick of them, he's sick of them.. who isn't? The developers have cut the price of the game from $20 to $10. They need the extra cash. At the time of me writing this review, they are purely cosmetic aswell. Each "cosmetic" item in this shop has an equivalent that can be obtained by playing the game.\n\n[GAMEPLAY]- I love this game. It runs so smoothly! I was amazed that the game was actually exactly how the trailer showed. I have enjoyed a couple of hours playing this game and I play on spending many more. It's like a mixture of Call of Duty, Titan Fall, and League of Legends.\n\n[GRAPHICS]- The game is pretty. It's not meant to have top-notch graphics, the developers wanted to make a fun game that's really cheap and can run on computers that are in mint-condition.\n\n[IMPROVEMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS]- Some weapons are clearly better than others. Anyone that has played Minimum for at least 15 minutes can honestly say that the swords are too op. I believe that swords should be at least half of the power that they currently have. I have purchased the grenade launcher and the fork launcher, I believe that the launchers should get at least a 25% speed buff because anyone with the starter weapons can kill you more efficiently. To get a kill with these weapons, you need to basically steal someone else's kill! I feel awful doing it so I stick to starter weapons most of the time.\n\n[MOST IMPORTANT SUGGESTION]- If I had to choose one thing, I would ask if the drops from players can have a 3-5 second shield on them for the killer because figuratively speaking, 75% of the time some dude with a sword rushes my kill and takes the drops.\n\n[ENDING THOUGHT]- In conclusion, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes games such as Dota, League of Legends, Call of Duty, Battlefield, and Gears of War.","September 18, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Amazing armor and weapon designs. The Titans are ♥♥♥♥ING AWESOME! A better game then COD. Textures are so high res my PC cant even run this game at 60fps on max settings... Swords are too damn over powered ♥♥♥♥ing level ones kept killing me with them swords. Really gay... It needs to be nerfed. Snipers got travel time which is great, makin it feel more real.\nI still don't get why can't we just permanently buy custom armor and not buy it in-game. The weapon leveling system is great though...\n\nHighly recommend this game to all you guys who don't know what to do with their money\nOverall I would rate 8.6/100","September 19, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunToxx/recommended/214190/","sunToxx","sunToxx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sunToxx/","253 products in account","Review: Alpha State and Focus on Low Skill Kills\n\nFirst the good things. The game's graphics are, at least for my taste, very nice. And the low poly design, along with some more optimizations, could allow this game to have very low system requirements. It's potentially the only recent shooter i could run at a constant and stable 120fps/hz.\n\nA little downside here, the game seems to be locked at 90 fps, which is a bit sad in times of 120Hz monitors. Probably an engine limitation, but most likely one that could be changed. Maybe even in the config files if one looks for it.\n\nAlso, the combination of a shooter with a moba, is extremely nice. Huge addictive potential here. The Titan game mode is spot on and could even survive as a single gametype in a shooter.\n\nUnfortunately, that's already all good there is to say for the moment. So now to the weak sides.\n\nFirst of all, they claim to have left early access. But this game is not even in Beta stage. In a Beta, most of the features are already there. In this game most feats are still placeholders. So what we got here is an alpha build.\n\nThe game's weakest point is, unfortunately, the combat part. Everything you found in the past 10 years in serious shooters, that was counted by top players as skill free, honorless or plain trolling, is what Minimum promotes at the moment.\n\nThat the weapon sounds, like the AR, sound like pea shooters, could be forgiven. But that the strongest "tactic" ingame is, to bunny hop (10 meters high, and nonstop) while spamming grenades (non stop), is ... well, i lack the words to put it in a nice way. It seems to be a bad joke, and one wonders how old the devs of this game are. Serious combat looks different.\n\nNext worst thing is the amount of melee in this game. An honorful melee kill is one where you sacrifice the chance for an easy kill, to get a cool kill with a melee weapon. In Minimum however, you get super speed, insane dashes, selfheal and whatnot, to get free kills.\n\nThis doesn't mean that you rack up insane numbers of kills this way. But it means that you get a lot of undeserved kills. Which is never a good thing in a game, because that is what makes a lot of gamers move on to other sources of entertainment. Very bad idea when you are trying to build a playerbase. One of the worst ideas in fact. So your main choices now are, to also go the crappy way of melee in a shooter. Or increase your armor, and thus becoming slower and slower...\n\nThe developers cleary point into a for me very strange direction. Instead of promoting proven to be addictive shooter combat, they degrade this game to a sort of hack'n slash'n spray'n spam fest. It's fun for a short while, but gets boring rather fast.\n\nBut this most likely strongly depends on what type of game player you are. If you are not happy by dominating through the use (or abuse) of certain game mechanics to gain an advantage, then this game is defenitely not for you.\n\nOn the other hand, if all you need to be happy is rack up kills, no matter how skillfree or honorless, then this game has a whole lot to offer. It basically combines all those mechanics that are frowned upon in serious matches in one game.\n\nAlso, one thing that i find very worrying, is an option in the menus. The game seems to support gamepads and has options for aiming assist. This is an absolute no-go in a shooter on pc, and i hope they will make sure that controllers do not even come close to the accuracy that can be achieved with a mouse. This would be almost as bad as officially allowing aimbots.\n\nKeep in mind though that this game appears to be in early alpha still though. So a lot can still change. And spending 5 bucks for it on a Steam sale is certainly not a mistake. Not only because some good laughs can be had, but also to give the devs more time to fine tune this game. This game could be very long term addicting and lure out of lot of cash out of peoples pockets for skins and the like if it were more serious.\n\nOne thing that would be very nice to see, if the general direction this game seems to go is maintained, would be if in the stats the different types of kills (shot/explosives/melee) would be visible seperately.\n","September 19, 2014","true","28.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is borderline BROKEN. Well first, this game is fun BUT ONLY WHEN PLAYING HORDE MODE!!! Horde mode is really the only mode that doesn't have Level 5 Katana rushers charging at you every minute. Katanas are what breaks the game.\n\nReasons:\nLevel 1 Katana takes 3-4 strikes to kill.\nKatanas make you impossible to hit especially when the frames are down, but I'll ge to that.\nKatanas give you a speed boost.\nWHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!?!?! Absolutely not! How I think this situation should be remedied. Katanas give you a -30% health detriment. No speed bonus. (Why would you need a speed bonus when your katana has a built-in dash function already?)\n\nOkay, I think I've covered the Katanas. Now onto the snipers. VERY, VERY HARD. Do not come into this game thinking you'll be blowing robot's heads off left and right. No. The headshot hitbox is TINY. Honestly, come on. You're zooming around the battlefield at 30 MPH and the hitbox is literally the size of the head, which I get, because why should you be able to kill someone with a headshot when it would normally go right past their ear? Well, it's impossible to hit. And snipers take 2-3 shots to kill.\nHow to remedy: Snipers get a 40% faster rate of fire. PLEASE IT IS SO SLOW. Second, Make a sniper 1-2 shot kill. Third, expand the headshot hitbox.\n\nOkay, now those frames I was talking about.\nMy computer is overkill when it comes to this. Specs: Processer-3.16ghz Graphics-Radeon HD7790. More than enough? Yes. Soo, why am I getting choppy frames? I can play Battlefield 3 at 60FPS on Ultra, and this simple graphical game can only run at 30 fps avg with 10 fps frame drops? C'mon... I think this should have stayed in Beta a bit longer to smooth out these problems.\n\nI wouldn't advise buying this game until a patch comes in because you'll just end up screaming and throwing your mouse at the wall.\n\nBut it is a fun game, just really, really, broken!","September 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A bare minimum game without any high resolution details or environments because it doesn't need them. On it's own it already outshines other titles of the same genre. With objectives and game modes so simplisitc all that needs to be done is grab your gun and run into action. Titan Mode pits two mechanical behemoths against one another as players run around collecting crystals to help stengthen their massive ally all while blowing away the opposite team in blocky destruction. Customizable loadouts, armor selections and schematic crafting add to strategy and overall enjoyment.\nMore than worth the money and with future improvements already on the way, this can only get better.\n\nA few suggestions for the devs\n- Implement a proper level matching system. Basically pitting players together of the equal level and skill.\n\n- Block off spawn containers once a player exits them. Too many people exploit the invulnerable aspect of them and shoot others while protected. Or at least prevent shooting from within them.\n\n- Lower sword melee damage. Base damage on swords seems a bit OP for single blades, dual blades can be an exception.\n\n- Armor crafting should be a sperate loadout option same as weapons.

However, with this art style it makes me wonder why I can only get 10 frames a second. Im just rendering blocks as well as some shading and effects. I dont have a very powerful computer, but what I have should be able to run this game relatively well on low or minimal settings. It says the recomended is 8 gigs of ram, but I didnt see it use all of the 4 gigs I have, and it didnt use all of my CPU power which passes the 2.0 GHz standard for the game. While it would be fun to play from what I can tell, and I can accept its early access and all, but save your money if you dont have a very powerful computer. I just cant understand what is limiting me to 10 FPS!! I hope they optimise this game SOON because I REALLY want to play this!!","June 25, 2014","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pretentiouswutangratz/recommended/214190/","pretentiouswutangratz","Me","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pretentiouswutangratz/","182 products in account","Minimum is a game where players in teams of five fight against another team, upgrading weapons, armor and their titan. Each team has one titan, which respawns shortly after death, and it's up to each team to defend their titan, while attacking the other, in the hopes of pushing their titan towards victory. It's a dynamic variation on the 'ARTS/MOBA' formula.\nThis game style works great, and is a tonne of fun but there are a few issues that need to be brought up.\n1. Nobody likes to communicate in this team game where co-operation is nearly always vital to victory.\n2. The game gives you the opportunity to get kills (which lets you upgrade your weapons and equipment while simultaneously getting score), or focus on killing or upgrading the titans (which lets you win the game). Being a video game, played by imperfect people, people often focus on getting kills instead of winning the game.\n3. It's really quite irritating that a player needs to grind to try out new things, and considering the fact that the balance can often end up wonky, it feels like Minimum asks for too much time.","January 28, 2015","true","11.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Don't listen to those who complain melee is too overpowered, it is very easy to counter with the right weaponry and with enough practice)\n\nCon's:\n*The inventory whipe kind of killed it for me, I had spent a long time obtaining my items and while they said that they made all cosmetics/items craftable, some of my favourites are actually not craftable, such as the harvest sickles and the pumpkin grenades.\n*Australian's may have a hard time playing as the player hosted servers can get quite lag, but its usually not unbearable.\n*Last I checked the co-op survival mode, I believe it was called Horde mode or something, was currently not working, which sucks because it used to be very fun.\n\n\nWhile the cons I've listed may seem to outweigh the pro's, this is really not the case. Minimum is a very fun game and I can't wait till it's completely restored to its former glory :)\n\nMinimum was one of my favourite games.\nHowever I would not recommend buying it (not that you can) in it's current state due to:\n\n#1 (This is the most important issue) The servers have been down for what seems like an eternity, you cannot actually play the game should you buy it![/b]\n\n#2 Prior to the server issues the new developers did not release that much new content. They redid some maps and released a couple new maps, but didn't add any new weapons or armour. (Not that the old developer were any better, as prior to the new developers taking ownership of the game they had not released anything new for quite some time). The last content update I remember was an april fools joke! When they added an invisible weapon and armour (the promo for said armour looked awesome, shame they didn't just make that armour)\n\n#3 Prior to the server issues the community was very small. Quite often you'd end up being put on a server with bots rather than one of the few servers with people on them. This was not always the case, as the community used to be huge before the old devs stopped making new content.\n\nMinimum was an amazing game and should they fix all the problems and actually bring the servers back online and start releasing new content (it would be a lot easier if they just hosted directly through steam like some other games) then go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it. But sadly it doesn't look like that time is coming any time soon :(\n\nThankyou for reading my review!","January 21","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

My friends and I picked it up over the steam summer sale while looking for some simple games we could play together. We found the matchmaking to be buggy, but still fun.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game involves you picking up powerups that drop from killed enemy's that upgrade your weapons up to 3 times, giving them more damage/new mechanics, as well as collecting materials to craft/upgrade armor sets. Powerups are lost on death but armor remains.\n\nIt has 3 game modes: Team Deathmatch, Horde mode, and a mode called Titan, where both teams try to escort a giant robot into the enemy base to destroy a power core. We mostly just played Titan mode, and had a fun time.\n\nThere are some pretty cool weapons like mine launchers and laser rifles, though some of them are imbalanced*Cough*Bouncechaingun*Cough*, meaning someone like me (Completely average at best) can stomp even people who are much higher skill level. Some, like the Cryo Sniper, are so weak/Hard to use that it makes it difficult to complete quests that require kills with that weapon.\n\nThere was an issue with rubberbanding, sometimes the servers lag out a little bit and makes everyone jump around, but it only happened maybe once a match, if that. The matchmaking as a group is a mess. Sometimes the group leader gets into a game while everyone else is stuck in a lobby, sometimes invites would not bring you into the group, and it seems the game won't put you on the same team if you have more than 3 players in your group.\n\nTLDR: Fun, but buggy.

So incredibly boring. The variety of the weapons and the level design is so low you've pretty much seen it all within an hour of playing.\n\nThis game is not fairThere's this idiotic system where kills upgrade your weapon, but dying resets it. This means the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. While I enjoy a good hunt on a player who's topping the charts, it should be about skill - not whoever gets the lucky first kill. Once someone gets ahead, the rest of his team picks up the spoils for his kills and get equally beefy. This means the match is pretty much decided by this point. Armor stays between lives, but most of the options are more of a trade-off than a downright improvement like the weapon upgrades.\n\nYou need a pretty beefy machine to run thisDo not be fooled by the game's lack of textures and low polygon count; your system will struggle like a moped trying to haul an elephant, and the fact that the elephant appears to be wearing a corset doesn't help very much. Even the main menu isn't smooth. I run a Radeon 7670M for a graphics card, which is not much but enough to run most games at low to medium settings smoothly. It can run Far Cry 3 no problem. But this game... even with everything set to minimum (including turning shadows off completely and running at a lower resolution), this game STILL didn't hit the stable 60 FPS mark. 30 FPS may be fine for some games, but this game is very twitchy; not to the extend of, say, Doom, but twitchy enough you're at a disadvantage running at anything below stable 60 FPS.\n\nIt isn't finishedEven the tutorial text says features are still missing. Besides, there's plenty of bugs. I often got a second aiming reticule drawn on screen and was unable to get rid of it, leaving me to guess as to which one was the one which actually indicated where my bullets will go. If the match starts while you're in the menus it'll force you back to the main menu. Energy cores often disappear when titans hit them. The news on the main menu displays 'Lorem ipsum' text while it loads. When you select 'titan' as the game mode and hit the server browser, it'll take you to a shoddy webpage and show you all game modes anyway. Oh, and there's no server names or ping display, making it very likely you'll pick a server halfway across the world with terrible lag.\n\nSome minor annoyancesThe game's own account system which the unnecessary password restrictions (it needs to contain at least 7 characters which one capital letter and one number). The keyboard input lag when entering said password. The unexplained glow on the titans when they first spawn (I'm assuming this means they're invulnerable at that time). Stats on the weapons (damage, firerate, etc.) are nowhere to be found, making your guess as to which weapon to unlock next as good as any. The sheer number of different pick-ups that all look the same, especially in the heat of the moment. Nowhere is it explained that health regenerates (it becomes apparent pretty fast, but I'd sooner associate making someone glow with a power-up, not being low on health). Aim assist and mouse smoothing are on by default. The giant hitboxes on titans, making it impossible to shoot enemies behind them. The jerky animations on the titans.

Even if you can stand all the aforementioned problems, the gameplay really isn't that good.

The idea with the titans and the creeps is interesting (though nothing new), but the execution is just abysmal. If you're looking for an FPS with a little bit of MOBA mixed in (like I was), Titanfall really does the whole creep thing a lot better, and you can actually pilot the titans in that game. If you want the big titan to protect and move forward, Team Fortress 2's cart mode is vastly superior (not to mention free and runs like a dream on old hardware).\n\nNothing to see here, move along.","January 7, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So incredibly boring. The variety of the weapons and the level design is so low you've pretty much seen it all within an hour of playing.\n\nThis game is not fairThere's this idiotic system where kills upgrade your weapon, but dying resets it. This means the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. While I enjoy a good hunt on a player who's topping the charts, it should be about skill - not whoever gets the lucky first kill. Once someone gets ahead, the rest of his team picks up the spoils for his kills and get equally beefy. This means the match is pretty much decided by this point. Armor stays between lives, but most of the options are more of a trade-off than a downright improvement like the weapon upgrades.\n\nYou need a pretty beefy machine to run thisDo not be fooled by the game's lack of textures and low polygon count; your system will struggle like a moped trying to haul an elephant, and the fact that the elephant appears to be wearing a corset doesn't help very much. Even the main menu isn't smooth. I run a Radeon 7670M for a graphics card, which is not much but enough to run most games at low to medium settings smoothly. It can run Far Cry 3 no problem. But this game... even with everything set to minimum (including turning shadows off completely and running at a lower resolution), this game STILL didn't hit the stable 60 FPS mark. 30 FPS may be fine for some games, but this game is very twitchy; not to the extend of, say, Doom, but twitchy enough you're at a disadvantage running at anything below stable 60 FPS.\n\nIt isn't finishedEven the tutorial text says features are still missing. Besides, there's plenty of bugs. I often got a second aiming reticule drawn on screen and was unable to get rid of it, leaving me to guess as to which one was the one which actually indicated where my bullets will go. If the match starts while you're in the menus it'll force you back to the main menu. Energy cores often disappear when titans hit them. The news on the main menu displays 'Lorem ipsum' text while it loads. When you select 'titan' as the game mode and hit the server browser, it'll take you to a shoddy webpage and show you all game modes anyway. Oh, and there's no server names or ping display, making it very likely you'll pick a server halfway across the world with terrible lag.\n\nSome minor annoyancesThe game's own account system which the unnecessary password restrictions (it needs to contain at least 7 characters which one capital letter and one number). The keyboard input lag when entering said password. The unexplained glow on the titans when they first spawn (I'm assuming this means they're invulnerable at that time). Stats on the weapons (damage, firerate, etc.) are nowhere to be found, making your guess as to which weapon to unlock next as good as any. The sheer number of different pick-ups that all look the same, especially in the heat of the moment. Nowhere is it explained that health regenerates (it becomes apparent pretty fast, but I'd sooner associate making someone glow with a power-up, not being low on health). Aim assist and mouse smoothing are on by default. The giant hitboxes on titans, making it impossible to shoot enemies behind them. The jerky animations on the titans.

I haven't played this game as of recent days so I have no clue of any changes that may have occured. I will say that it can be hard to play with friends and I have had a friend say to me that his graphics card was not supported. Very ashamed he was looking forward to the play a game different from the other games we have recently played. Also despite the name I have a friend who runs games on a low end laptop and he cannot play this game smootly even if he lowers the settings. For me however i have a PC that runs between a good performancee and a high performance. In this case i can play it pretty smooth on high settings. I do like the gameplay and  i will say that my favorite weapon is the beam rifle. One big reason as it embodies they "Hey I am over here" and the "You better stay there" intimidation of the weapon because it is just nasty how it can destroy them and stunt their through the battlefield. Will I play this game again? Maybe by myself otherwise it is a good joke to use when my friend asks "What vidya you guys wanna play?"","April 6, 2015","true","13.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Actually its not a bad game, don't let the cover judge the book. but it has its share of flaws. Down below I will list up all the things I noticed through our game session with friends. But first.\n\nPros / Cons Just a quickie..\n\nPros.\nGreat concept. [The Titan gamemode in this case]\nInteresting game styles.\nFast paced action.\nMinimalism done right.\nTeamwork needed to win.\nCrafting and Market mechanism.\nAwesome visuals.\nThat oughta' summed up the game.\n\nCons\nThe actions sometimes become unpredictable. [eg. Cutting people for an hour and dont die]\nLag spikes and low framerate on 4+cores and 4gb ram\nHitboxes for objects too big. [Sentry, Titans ... Can't move away beside them]\nIf playing in a party, It mostly never gives you the same team. Happens with 3+ people.\nI got this game for 5€ in the Team Pack for me and my friends, And we didn't /entirely/ regret getting the game, But it is good, Because it packs enough adrenaline it pulls you back to play more until you eventually tire out. It has badass swordplays, Sick gunfights and OP sniper shooting ranges. Like mentioned, The only setback is the lack of optimalisation. Even for a game with such low graphics can lag hard on good computers such as mine or my friends'. It kinda ruins the fun, But surely makes up later in-game. In overall, Buy the game to support the developers. It has room for development.\n\nI'd say: 7/10.

Minimum is a barebones shooter where your skill is determined by how fast you can maneuver and how well you can aim.\n\nMinimum is a fast-paced, strategic twitch shooter with solid, simplistic gameplay and so much more to come. There IS a community playing this game right now,  and people do keep up with it. It only takes about 4 seconds to connect to a match with all 10 people. The developers DO release updates fairly often, and they're high quality and expansive. I bought the game when it came out and even before the content they've added the game was good.\n\nThings to like:\n\n- The art style fits the game very well. The game doesn't have any sort of premise, so it doesn't try to fit any strict stylistic rules. The result: Firemen astronauts with Barney heads being attacked by raptors.\n\n- At the same time, the environments look very good. The map design is fluid and clean while having tremendous asthetic appeal. Maps have a well-organized balance of long range and close quarters areas.\n\n- Gameplay is very solid and clean. No frills, just skills. There are guns, giant grenade launchers and flaming swords to fit any playstyle. The better you are at aiming in two dimensions (something most modern shooters don't train you for) the better you'll be at this game.\n\n- Developers talk with the community! There's a thread on steam regarding weapon balancing and ideas, there's a website with forums for users to talk with developers, and the devs listen!\n\n- Matches have incredibly good back and forth. I've played matches where my team was seconds from losing only to take the next ten minutes making a coordinated effort pushing back and winning the match.\n\n- Movement is fast and smooth, akin to playing scout in Team Fortress 2. Except now you can play as a scout with flaming swords and a sniper rifle.\n\n- If you don't like multiplayer (or just need a break), there's a really fun horde mode where you face off against ninjas, raptors and knights.\n\n- It isn't free to play! This means you can actually have fun! Players can't buy weapons to have an advantage over you. There are skins for sale in game, but they're actually easy enough to get without spending any money. Because of Minimum's integration with steam's inventory system, you can trade and sell items you get by playing for skins you might want. I traded a few weapons for a pretty kickass shinobi armor set that I use all the time.\n\nThings to be aware of:\n\n- Balancing is a little tricky at the moment. It's easy to get frustrated at players that have the game figured out a little better than you might.\n\n- Getting kills buffs you, dying detriments you. This sounds frustrating, but with the way the game is balanced it isn't too much of a challenge. If you take time to practice and figure out what works best for you, it won't matter that you were killed and lost your level five weapon because you'll know how to earn it back.\n\n- Obviously still some bugs and lag issues, as this game is still being developed. Getting rubberbanded every few matches is a little annoying but I'm sure it will be resolved eventually. However, the servers are generally very good. I usually have a ping of 20ms or less.\n\nSo I hope me writing this enourmous review will convince a few people to pick up this game while it's on sale. It's only $4 right now, and we could always use more players.","June 19, 2015","true","24.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthehood/recommended/214190/","iamthehood","MD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthehood/","310 products in account","A bad server browser, poor audio and visual effects design, a limited amount of maps and imbalanced melee weapons bring down would could have been a well-off third person shooter.\n\nThe server browser button opens up a spreadsheet in a window in the steam overlay and from it you can see the IP, player count, and gamemode of each server but you CANNOT see the ping. I don't know of a solid multiplayer title that does display ping times in the server browser. Even in game I assume the ping amount that is seen in the scoreboard is false. I have 20-28 ping yet am rubberbanding and seeing delays in item pickups, delays in player deaths, and am not seeing all bounce minigun projectiles appear while firing is how I assume the ping number is false.\n\nThe audio fades out when you are at low health and even before then, many weapons sound as powerful as water pistols, like the speed shotgun. The audio fade makes it very difficult to hear incoming fire, and does not do a good job of discerning the already blocky(literrally) weapons one another. The visual choices of what should be displayed in the HUD(hint - a healthbar, which isn't) don't really make sense. Your equipment recharge icon is very small so it's difficult to tell when exactly it will be ready again. Instead of a health bar you can see how much health you have by purely guessing from how yellow and bright your body is. Seriously, there is not way of understanding exactly how much health you have at any one time. This game more than many others should show your health amounts, especially when there are weapon upgrades that do more damage the more they are upgraded, and when armor pieces either increase damage done to you or increase maximum health or increase resistances to certain damage types. If it was a game with fixed health amounts and fixed weapon damages then I could understand, I wouldn't need to know the exact amount of hp to see if I am winning a fight or not, or whether or not I can peak one more time for an extra shotgun blast for a kill, knowing I can trade a hit and still win. In this game you just guess. In addition to those poor visual design choices there are the effects. Upgrading your katanas will allow you to have fire burst in a significant area around you, many times making sight impossible past the fire. having very bright and obnoxious weapon effects on characters makes trying to tell the already innacurate hp to brightness system even worse.\n\nA perfect example of bad sound design is the fact that there is a hitmarker placed near your crosshair everytime you land a hit and the option of turning on hit sounds. Even the designer(s) knew it was bad.\n\nBut all of this is still bearable, despite the sounds, server browser, visuals, the unlock system being quite a pain to grind through and the maps being very few, the game itself is very fun... until someone uses the katanas.\n\nThe katanas, any type really, are the strongest weapon in the game and are very overpowered. They kill faster than any weapon in the game, have a large hit radius(even vertically) and do not require any ammunition or aim, as they will turn you in the direction of your opponent on every attack. The only way to kill a player with a katana is to kill them before they get close to you which is very difficult when you can see around corners with the 3rd person camera, can sprint and can use the alternate fire button to instantly close the distance on an opponent. Coupled with the fact that many weapons have a very substantial time to kill, unless you are in a very open area and the katana-wielder is far away, they will get to you 4/5 times and at that point you will not get away. They are simply ridiculous and most TDM matches come down to how many people are using katanas on each time. Every other weapon in the game requires you to put the enemy in your crosshair while trying to get yourself out of theirs. The katanas don't care and sword fights boil down to 2 players spamming attacks wildly and uncontrollably in an attempt to kill the other player. Due to the fact katanas can close gaps instantly means they are massively overpowered and have no direct counter other than using certain items to evade and run away from the sword.","February 2, 2015","false","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

Everything is subject to change. Serious balance changes are needed.\n\nMinimum is a game that i've been anticipating for a while, it's a neat concept, it has unique gameplay, and the gameplay is fluid.\nIt has tons of problems though.\nAs of right now, melee is absolutely overpowered, it's hard to get a single match without some spaz running around chopping everybody on the other team to pieces.\nSpeaking of teams, the matchmaking & balancing is also really terrible. Numerous times i've been on the receiving end of a 1v4, or worse. There is absolutely nothing that can be done if you're by yourself, unless everyone on the other team is braindead or afk, or if you're going hard with melee & speed.\nTons of balance changes need to be made, an example would be with the different armors. Most of the armor sets are hardly viable at all, and the rest are incredibly situational...Except for the berzerker set. Because you can't change your armor once you've applied it, there is never any reason to go with anything other than the berzerker set. It scales the best with levels, and is usable with ANY weapon. Don't get me wrong, some pieces like the Icarus chestplate are useful, it gives a nice increase to melee protection. The only problem is that it's as previously mentioned, very situational, and the movement penalty cancels itself out when you can't get away from a melee user.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, and hopefully this game's future will be brighter.","May 10, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The developers added new maps, cool things to craft and new game modes. The overall multiplayer stability is much better now. Matchmaking is not perfected yet - there is no server browser and no lobby system and sometimes, I have to wait more than 2 minutes to join a game. But this is manageable compared to the gameplay experience you get.\n\nTitan mode is the heart of the game, it combines old school deathmatch and MOBA focused gameplay, but you can also play classic team deathmatch or the cooperative horde mode against the AI. The gameplay is fast and dynamic, you have to put some time into the game to get more experienced. Your weapon gets more effective with every kill, so there is definitely some snowball effect here, but the better is the feeling when you get your first killstreak. Don't underestimate the importance of crafting and customization. Finding the right set of armor can be the key to dominate a match.\n\nLast but not least, the minimalist art style makes the game fresh and unique. You won't find many textures but the effects are great, the sound is powerful and the maps are very well designed.","September 12, 2014","true","25.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthehood/recommended/214190/","iamthehood","MD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iamthehood/","310 products in account","A bad server browser, poor audio and visual effects design, a limited amount of maps and imbalanced melee weapons bring down would could have been a well-off third person shooter.\n\nThe server browser button opens up a spreadsheet in a window in the steam overlay and from it you can see the IP, player count, and gamemode of each server but you CANNOT see the ping. I don't know of a solid multiplayer title that does display ping times in the server browser. Even in game I assume the ping amount that is seen in the scoreboard is false. I have 20-28 ping yet am rubberbanding and seeing delays in item pickups, delays in player deaths, and am not seeing all bounce minigun projectiles appear while firing is how I assume the ping number is false.\n\nThe audio fades out when you are at low health and even before then, many weapons sound as powerful as water pistols, like the speed shotgun. The audio fade makes it very difficult to hear incoming fire, and does not do a good job of discerning the already blocky(literrally) weapons one another. The visual choices of what should be displayed in the HUD(hint - a healthbar, which isn't) don't really make sense. Your equipment recharge icon is very small so it's difficult to tell when exactly it will be ready again. Instead of a health bar you can see how much health you have by purely guessing from how yellow and bright your body is. Seriously, there is not way of understanding exactly how much health you have at any one time. This game more than many others should show your health amounts, especially when there are weapon upgrades that do more damage the more they are upgraded, and when armor pieces either increase damage done to you or increase maximum health or increase resistances to certain damage types. If it was a game with fixed health amounts and fixed weapon damages then I could understand, I wouldn't need to know the exact amount of hp to see if I am winning a fight or not, or whether or not I can peak one more time for an extra shotgun blast for a kill, knowing I can trade a hit and still win. In this game you just guess. In addition to those poor visual design choices there are the effects. Upgrading your katanas will allow you to have fire burst in a significant area around you, many times making sight impossible past the fire. having very bright and obnoxious weapon effects on characters makes trying to tell the already innacurate hp to brightness system even worse.\n\nA perfect example of bad sound design is the fact that there is a hitmarker placed near your crosshair everytime you land a hit and the option of turning on hit sounds. Even the designer(s) knew it was bad.\n\nBut all of this is still bearable, despite the sounds, server browser, visuals, the unlock system being quite a pain to grind through and the maps being very few, the game itself is very fun... until someone uses the katanas.\n\nThe katanas, any type really, are the strongest weapon in the game and are very overpowered. They kill faster than any weapon in the game, have a large hit radius(even vertically) and do not require any ammunition or aim, as they will turn you in the direction of your opponent on every attack. The only way to kill a player with a katana is to kill them before they get close to you which is very difficult when you can see around corners with the 3rd person camera, can sprint and can use the alternate fire button to instantly close the distance on an opponent. Coupled with the fact that many weapons have a very substantial time to kill, unless you are in a very open area and the katana-wielder is far away, they will get to you 4/5 times and at that point you will not get away. They are simply ridiculous and most TDM matches come down to how many people are using katanas on each time. Every other weapon in the game requires you to put the enemy in your crosshair while trying to get yourself out of theirs. The katanas don't care and sword fights boil down to 2 players spamming attacks wildly and uncontrollably in an attempt to kill the other player. Due to the fact katanas can close gaps instantly means they are massively overpowered and have no direct counter other than using certain items to evade and run away from the sword.","February 2, 2015","false","5.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

This was compounded by the fact that swords seem to be overpowered (faster movement + more damage). Add it all up and what I was left with feeling was frustration that there seems to be little to no hope at 'getting better' since you only live a few seconds, die, and all that non-learning-curve losing just enables an already-knowledgable team to get even farther ahead in the match.\n\nIt's basically a snowball effect of initial loss creates greater loss, while people who have seemingly been playing longer exploit that to it's fullest. Which I suppose is fine for them...but I'd be worried by how far the community can grow, if the only incentive for playing is being crushed regularly, and thoroughly.\n\nWhich is a shame too - I bought a pack of this thinking it would be something fun for my friends and I to play. Now I will urge them against an installation altogether. I'm actually the one out of us who has some patience for punishing gameplay, and even I think the amount of overkill you can experience strangles any chance of learning and becoming better out of a losing match.\n\nIt's unfortunate, because mechanically Minimum is interesting. It reminds me of Monday Night Combat, except skills and classes are replaced by gear, and there's an emphasis on escorting Titans (at least in that mode) and improving them that, in theory, means different people could play different roles.\n\nAs it is though, the game is woefully imbalanced towards swords, and further punishing a losing team to the point of discouragement, than learning through loss. I'd rather take a more balanced experience like TF2 over this as it is.","September 21, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

There is minimal innovation here, and the minimum number of active players for it to not be officially dead. There's nothing overwhelmingly bad about Minimum, it's just average. The store page makes comparisions to twitch shooters and MOBAs, neither elements actually exist in the game. Combat is third-person and rather slow, with regenerating health and unlimited ammo. Strategy is pretty barren, as all characters are the same. Some weapons can provide utility in area control or slowing enemies, but they must be crafted in the awkward Blueprints system.\n\nThe core game mode is team deathmatch with minor lane-pushing elements. Two titans spawn and meet in the lane, while everyone shoots them or shoots each other. Killing enemies lets you pick up orbs to "customize" your weapons in linear upgrades. "Customize" normally means options, but this is all automatic. These upgrades are decreased when you die, which means you can weaken a fed opponent, but good luck. Armor can be applied and upgraded, which offers some real choices, but those upgrades are never lost in death. An opponent with max weapons and max armor will always be a problem. To make snowballing worse, there is a creep-farming period after both titans die. The team with more damage will destroy creeps quicker, and pressure the weaker team from farming creeps. The next Titan spawn will consistently be stronger for the snowballing team, enabling them to trap the weaker team in the spawn. A titan with creep advantage will win the fight and push naturally, and the only way to stop it is for the weaker team to shoot it down. Base turrets are pitiful against Titans, and there is little to stop opponents from filling your base with unlimited bullets while hugging cover.\n\nThe graphics style is interesting, but the game lacks engagement. Unlocking content is a confusing process with 4 different unlocking resources in a paid game. The progression system is trying to keep players hooked, but it clearly hasn't worked. Despite developer statements of over 120 thousand sales, there are only a few hundred active players. See http://steamcommunity.com/app/214190/discussions/0/622954747296773845/ for details.\n\nI got the game at 50% off at full launch, and I'm not really mad about that. I'm just not passionate about the game, and clearly thousands of people agree. It could be interesting, but it doesn't do much different. It feels like Loadout, but that game is faster, free, and offers unique weapons without massive snowballing designs. Titan mode doesn't change Team Deathmatch and is nowhere near a MOBA. The MNC games did that far better. Almost no one is playing Minimum, and everything is multiplayer. The game doesn't do anything great enough to justify consideration, and I don't see new content other than maps and skins. The potential was taken to the minimum, and playerbase rests at the minimum, how fitting.","February 5, 2015","false","20.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

A lot of levels also work perfectly to just go around with the shotgun and kill everyone. We all essentially just switched to the shotgun at the end because it was the only way to truely keep up.\n\nThe titan fighting seems cool but it's rather basic and they just seem to be giant sponges with little indication of how to kill them.

The gameplay is quite action packed and fun. TDM lets you just murder everyone, Titan allows you more space to roam and requires strategy to master, and Horde offers a unique man-hunt experience. Many people complain of weapon imbalances and while they are true to a certain extent I have not found a single weapon that cannot be countered one way or another. Yes, the glitches are there, but not adundant. It is definitely not refined, but what do you expect? It's in early access still.\n\nOverall I recommend the game, but you need to be patient with glitches and taking the time to obtain the weapons/armor you'll need to match your playstyle. Titan may not be for everyone, but even the TDM mode is fun. Balance is decent so long as you think reasonably and set up the proper counters.","September 23, 2014","true","13.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zero_Rogue/recommended/214190/","Zero_Rogue","[MAD6]ZeroRogue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zero_Rogue/","103 products in account","This game is very, very, very, unfinished.\n\nI came to this game because of titan mode that seemed like a interesting concept. While this is true, I cannot think of any other thing that this game did well. Half the game is missing, and due to this many elements of the game become useless after a point. The first issue is very apparent from the first match on wards, Lag. Both graphical and Network lag happens all the time. This game boasts a very low system requirements, This is untrue. I am at the high end of their Minimum-Suggested Requirements and the game was unplayable even at the lowest settings. I had to edit the ini files and turn off everything to actually get the game to work at a reasonable frame rate.\n\nBeyond this the lag persists in it's other form. Network lag is very apparent during the match. Often I find my character “rubber banding” forward and back as I walk, and have even gotten teleported back a few feet because the server said I got caught on some geometry while the client didn't. This brings me to the next issue. The maps are littered with places you can get stuck or caught on. I can understand this is an alpha game but with no way as far as I can see to force respawn yourself this becomes a major issue. And the issue of respawning continues the issues as there is no way to change your build without suicide. This became another serious issue in Horde mode where if you click the wrong button(something that I did while trying to get to the build select menu), you are stuck in that build till everyone dies on the map or the round restarts(given you thew yourself on the enemy).\n\nAbout a third of the time I  start up the game, and it crashes at some point within the first 30 seconds. The issues do not stop there. While in a party with my friends if we leave a match the party host has the restart the game in order to re invite us to play again. Many times I find the weapon description Missing as if it failed to load. Clicking on it multiple times eventually get's it to appear. The game Itself is just as broken. There are many parts of the game that don't seem to be balanced. The titans for instance seem to take random chunks out of each others health. The drop system is another concern, if you kill a player the loot from them drops at the corpse. This means both a teammate who had not fired a shot can steal all your items. This also means long range builds(such a sniping) becomes worthless as you don't get the items you need to upgrade. (you do get weapon upgrades through kills but no armor upgrades). Speaking of upgrades the crafting system in the game needs a MAJOR overhaul. Currently when you join a game your first job is not to see what you can do for the team but rather to open the crafting menu and start crafting up your armor. Armor crafting should be automatic.\n\nThis leaves me with the biggest issues I have with the game.\nFirst is the Bots. In games if there are not enough players bots fills the slots. While this is somewhat ok, the bots are what like to call “cheating bots”. These  bots are low quality bots that cheat to compete with players. Many times I've turned corners to have bots waiting for me. Or going along when a bot decides that I should die and starting hitting me from across the map with perfect accuracy. This makes any element of stealth impossible. Secondly, the name Minimum, way too common of a word. You try to Google search anything related with this game and half the results are for other things. A Third big issue for me is the Controls. When I play I often throw a grenade on the ground quickly. However when I quickly move my mouse down the camera go up rather than down! Beyond this the third person is not done correctly as your character is often blocking your view and enemies can spot you while you can't see them. A first person mode is badly needed for this game. The final and biggest travesty is the fact shots keep disappearing! Many times I've shot, or thrown a grenade and the projectile either disappears in flight or just does not appear! In a shooter this a very bad problem one that should never be seen alpha or not.\n\nTo put it simple this game might be fun when it's done but in it's current state, do not buy. Wait till it's done.","November 30, 2014","false","5.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game handles nicely I never felt confused by the controls it's very easy to get into and the armor crafting adds a layer of strategy to the game. Outside of matches progression wise you'll level up and earn rewards from that and completing matches wich can be put towards buying blueprints to then craft weapons. weapon crafting is instant there is no long wait timer and as someone who plays a game like Warframe alot this is a nice sight.

I haven't played this for very long, so I'm not gonna pretend that my review is worth any merit. So I'll just stick to objective observations at the time this review is written (30th Jan 2015,) and try to minimise MUH OPINIONS.\n\nPROS:\nNon-P2W. No amount of money can introduce advantage to anyone.\n[opinion]Art style[/opinion]\nLevel design (balanced, varied, thematic, and [opinion]beautiful[/opinion])\nAddictive\n[opinion]FUNFUNFUN[/opinion]\nGRAFFICS\nCONS:\nGRAFFICS (not very optimized as of yet)\nNo DX9 support. IMHO to appeal to a wider audience, they should support DX9. I can see the Titan mode being a popular e-sport because it's a simple game, yet there are so many elements to take care of when trying to complete the objective. Think DOTA. I don't play it, but I know that even people with the most minimal hardware can play and be very good at it.\nMenu UI can definitely be improved (non-gameplay sections)\nI'd like to add another point to the cons section, which is wonky netcode(?) but I'm not sure if it's justified. Currently I'm running on a mediocre-at-best hardware setup, with all the graphics feature set to the minimum, and I've seen reports of players with more than sufficient setups having only around 30-45fps. I'm pretty sure I didn't get more than 24fps, and it's really hard to hit anything. I've had myself and seen other people rubberband. Not sure if it's my network, my hardware, or the netcode. The ping never registers more than 65, and I play other games with similar ping just fine.\n\nOVERALL it's a weak 6.5/10 atm, but the devs are still improving it so far. Don't be fooled by my score - I've had tons of fun in Minimum, and I [opinion]think you should[/opinion] too.","January 30, 2015","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The thing is, it was executed so poorly beyond my expectations (and I wasn't even expecting much). There is no weapon balance. Katanas seem like the way to go because they're the only weapons with stupid passive abilities, as well as ridiculous damage output with the least amount of effort to even play. So if you are a katana user, stop. The servers are also poopoo, and for some reason there is a 1 hour tutorial for a straightforward game. This game should be free to play if they are going to include microtransactions. I'm not going to dish out $5 for a crappy game just to pay even more to unlock weapons.","September 16, 2014","false","0.8"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","1"

It's a 3rd person moba that you can get into verys fast.\nBut in its current state, it is unplayable for my friends and me.\nWe built a party and joined a game. We started playing, but we instantly were in different teams.\nNot being able to join in the same team breaks a moba, doesn't it?\nA while after, we decided to build a new party and join a game again. This is where it got frustrating.\nThe menu UI went bananas, displayed random stuff, buttons that did nothing, processes could not be aborted, and, worst of all, we couldn't join any game. The few rounds I've played we're fun, but we couldn't play any more than that.\nAdditionally, lag spikes reset you up to a few meters, which pretty much breaks whatever you were just going to do.\n\nWe'll try again in a week or so, since the game itself wasn't aware that it was not early access anymore (smells like a missing update...), hoping that things will work out better.\nUntil then... nice idea, but pretty  unplayable.","September 15, 2014","false","3.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game needs so much work to be really playable. The balance is horrible, the game creates a quick divide between the winning and losing team, and balance is quickly lost. Killstreaks are rewarded with more power, and power is lost upon death. This creates a team that has Tier 5 weapons against a team with Tier 1, and that divide rarely changes significantly. Many weapons are entirely surpassed by weapons bought or created later in the game, but matchmaking doesn't separate teams by level, and it is extremely common to find someone with Dual Master Fire Swords while you still have the basic Katana.","September 27, 2014","false","2.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

My gaming rig is(i only list important things): AMD FX-8350, 2x sapphire HD7790 OC 2gb vram gddr5(crossfire) and 4gb ddr3 ram, and the game sometimes a little-bit choppy(its rare) but, the game don't have big graphics so its crazy.\nMy ping is always arround 24-40 and its sometime slooks like 100-200...its not good, i hope only i have this problem, and everybody play without any kind of lag.\nI h8 cs:go because the micro transactions, you can buy skins and more skins for real money, the skins cool but if i paid X euro or dollar for a game, i don't want to see any microtransaction.\nThe level up system cool, u get "cubes" and one cube=one weapon recipe, the weapons don't depends on the players level.\nThe community not big but helpful and good, you can find always servers with enough player :)\nThe design&ghrapic is great, really simple but amazing and entertaining visual effects+design, the audio good2, i love the sound of water, and the noise of the battle.\nThe game have 3 different and interesting gamemodes, first of all is deathmatch, its not as popular as the titan mode and its not special, u kill players of the other team and gain point for your team. Titan mode is more complicated and(i think) better, the red and white team have 2 titans(the titans not controlled by players, its bots) and 3 defending wall with destroyable turrets, your and your teams mission is defend the titan and destroy all the walls, and the isk what, the "nexus", when the enemy team's nexus destroyed, your team won. When the titans dead, will creeps spawn, and you can gain titan power-up with killing the creeps and collect the...."crystals?".\nThe last gamemode is horde, it simple, you vs bots, the mission is survive as long as you can, kill raptors, samuraies and other crazy things. You have another 3 teammate.\nIn all, this game is really cool with an amazing design and sound&visual effects, with 3 interesting, different gamemodes,\nbut a little-bit unfinished, its not a big problem, the developers always update the game and fix bugs or add extra things(last update a new map added with custome titans and creeps).\nSo its wroth a buy (y).\n","January 30, 2015","true","7.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","3","6","2","0"

(weapon will say maxed next to it under loadout) these weapons wreck shop. Also weapons get upgraded in game, but the bonus goes away when you die. Basically these weapons are a little too op, i have the maximized bullet hound, and let me tell you i can go through a game with an easy 40 kills. if not more (titan mode) so far i come into matches and either im really good, or really lucky. Since most people have 0 kills, the most kills ive seen from another player so far is 30. Its an easy game. However, i will say the melee weapons are slightly op, your tactical items (grenades and what not) are nice, but not very useful at times. Sniper rifles and shotguns are basically the bottom of the barrel.\nSo nice graphics, gameplay, feel, gamemodes, music.\nNot so good balance and or community (they dont seem to do a very good job or i just get alot of easy matches)\nCould be people play pvp and not titan, works for me\nOverall an 8/10 game, really love it.

I have played a little over an hour and have seen everything there is to see in this game: I will buy armor, max out my weapon, slaughter bot after bot that comes in my crosshairs, find and kill the golden creep, then win the match. Unless the matchmaking system will put you up against real opponents now and again, every match will be a replica of the last. Even with human opponents, the gameplay isn't as deep as was suggested by the description.","May 7, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

When one team's titan wins the titan will proceed to the generator, but there are obstacles in the way, such as a wall and an enemy turret, your team must destroy the turret and help with the wall. After that the titan will proceed to the enemy generator. There is a TDM (Team Death Match) play style too. And there is the last play style, the horde mode. In the horde mode you will fight waves of dinosaurs robots and more.

The game handles nicely I never felt confused by the controls it's very easy to get into and the armor crafting adds a layer of strategy to the game. Outside of matches progression wise you'll level up and earn rewards from that and completing matches wich can be put towards buying blueprints to then craft weapons. weapon crafting is instant there is no long wait timer and as someone who plays a game like Warframe alot this is a nice sight. This game holds alot of potential i can see it getting big I just hope either the devs advertise the game or a famous youtuber plays it so that the community can grow.","June 27, 2014","true","4.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There are not a whole lot of weapons, but enough to keep it interesting and simple. Controls are easy\nIn terms of balance, this game lacks a little\nThere are obviously stronger weapons, these are usually bullet hound and any melee\nOnce maxed. (weapon will say maxed next to it under loadout) these weapons wreck shop. Also weapons get upgraded in game, but the bonus goes away when you die. Basically these weapons are a little too op, i have the maximized bullet hound, and let me tell you i can go through a game with an easy 40 kills. if not more (titan mode) so far i come into matches and either im really good, or really lucky. Since most people have 0 kills, the most kills ive seen from another player so far is 30. Its an easy game. However, i will say the melee weapons are slightly op, your tactical items (grenades and what not) are nice, but not very useful at times. Sniper rifles and shotguns are basically the bottom of the barrel.\nSo nice graphics, gameplay, feel, gamemodes, music.\nNot so good balance and or community (they dont seem to do a very good job or i just get alot of easy matches)\nCould be people play pvp and not titan, works for me\nOverall an 8/10 game, really love it. Its worth 10 dollars but on sale its a really good deal.

There are many different ways to play, like titan mode where you team has to protect your titan, and when you titan gets to the middle you teams titan and the opposing team's titan clash. When one team's titan wins the titan will proceed to the generator, but there are obstacles in the way, such as a wall and an enemy turret, your team must destroy the turret and help with the wall. After that the titan will proceed to the enemy generator. There is a TDM (Team Death Match) play style too. And there is the last play style, the horde mode. In the horde mode you will fight waves of dinosaurs robots and more. If you like fast paced action, this is your game.","January 1, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game itself is a 3rd person shooter copy of "League of Legends" or "DOTA 2" with the game objective is to destroy a tower at the enemy base.  Minimum even uses the name "creeps" from DOTA for its miniture enemies that are crititcal to winning the game.  I personally don't enjoy this game style but even if I wanted to play these type of games, I RATHER JUST PLAY "DOTA 2" WITHOUT PAYING 15 DOLLARS FOR THIS PIECE OF ♥♥♥♥!\n\n2.  The second complaint about this game is the way it runs.  I recently bought a brand new ASUS laptop to play games on.  Here are the specs: Intel i5 5th Gen @ 2.4 GHZ, Intel HD 5500 graphics (512mb dedicated ram; set in bios) 8GB of ram.  Yet with those specs I cannot run the game at its LOWEST SETTINGS.  Now I can accept the fact I can't run a game if it was "ARMA 3" or "Crysis (any of them, your pick) because those games are full of details and beautiful graphics.  Minimum however doesn't get any kind of exception.  This particular game uses ♥♥♥♥IN' BASIC POLYGONS TO MAKE ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MODELS OF STAGES, PLAYERS, AND THE WEAPONS!!!!   THESE MODELS AREN'T TEXTURED EITHER!!!   WHYCAN'T I RUN THIS STUPID ♥♥♥ GAME!\n\nOverall, whatever you do, do not spend your hard earned money on this game.  This game is trash and I don't understand why Steam has no product control so idiots like these developers can publish broken games.  Don't buy this game.","October 2, 2015","false","1.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I have played a little over an hour and have seen everything there is to see in this game: I will buy armor, max out my weapon, slaughter bot after bot that comes in my crosshairs, find and kill the golden creep, then win the match. Unless the matchmaking system will put you up against real opponents now and again, every match will be a replica of the last.

It really takes away from the fun when you are restricted to only one mode. Personally, i think if it went free-to-play it would attract a lot more attention, gain more popularity, and way more people would be playing it. The crafting system i didn't get to see much of so i can't give my fully developed opinion on, but it seemed really cool that you have to craft the weapons rather than unlocking them like ine every other shooter game.

The team has worked tirelessly to bring the game back into a playable state.\n\nBefore the game went down I spent a load of time on all 3 game modes. The combat is fluid and adaptable. Your character is responsive and agile. They are robust enough for new players to get into the game, but fragile enough that the element of suprise still plays a large factor in deciding who wins a 1 on 1 combat scenario.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of the game is that players using melee weapons are nearly invincible compared to other weapons. I've never had an instance where swords were decidedly unkillable, as mentioned in other reviews. Like any game, players need to adapt their playstyle to the weapon they use. Machine guns will not work well in cramped spaces. Likewise, swords are next to useless in wide spaces. Your weapon decides what lanes you take.\n\nI have encountered two bugs, a texture error that does not affect gameplay whatsoever, and a leaderboard glitch that should be fixed with the new netcode the team is writing.\n\nFor me, the lack of gore is a huge bonus. I can play it with my young cousins without complaints from their parents.\n\nWhen this game is playable again, I would recomend it to anyone looking for any type of non-military shooter.","February 19","true","33.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The game used to be owned by Atari, if I am not mistaken, and Atari decided to stop funding it. Suddenly a few people start giving it a thumbs down saying that the game is dead and it wont come back. Yet the developers found another company willing to help fund it, and now the game is back up and running, the problem being that when most of it's previous players found out that the game "shut down" they didn't bother checking if it came back.\n\ni'll be honest giving a game thumbs down or saying it is bad because it has a low player base is wrong, the devs didn't implement that into their game, it should simply be a warning sing. Now the question is, is it good?\n♥♥♥♥ YEAH IT'S GOOD\nThe game allows the player to literally play their way, by allowing them to customize their loadouts with multiple guns and swords to choose, and armor sets with different stats and models. It has a quake feeling to it because of the crazy gun play, but third person. The concept for the game is creative and pretty original for one game mode, that being Titan Mode which is the most played, you have to kill these creeps and collect titan power up to make your titan more powerful, players will fight for the creeps, specially the golden creep which gives the titan a power up.  the other 2 game modes are survival (Horde) and Team Deathmatch. The game does have a lot a space for skill gameplay, it may seem sometimes very casual, but when you play the game you realize it requires more skill than it seems.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that it feels oddly optimized, when I'm in the menu it drops to 10 Fps but in game I have 30 Fps, thing is that I have ran heavier games and they run at 40-60 fps. Crashed very little time and the game has never gotten stuck on me. Other than that the game is fine.","May 21","true","14.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Titans respawn and back to Rock'em Sock'em robots.  Rinse.  Repeat.\n\nYou start with a selection of weapons and you can unlock more;\nmachine gun, sniper rifle, shotgun, sword\nYou can build armor during the game: head, chest,  and pants\ncurrently 2 option weapons - grenade and minigun turret\nupgrades drop when players or turrets are killed, all weapons upgrade 5 times.\n\nand now the bad news;\nall bullets travel through space, so sniper rifle and shotgun are mostly worthless unless you have precog.\nupgrades quickly get out of hand, and once you get ahead, staying ahead is easy.\nno minimap, no safe zones. you'll more than likely get spawn camped by players that know the maps.\nswords are OP and bunny hopping lets u win (since the whole my bullets need to travel through space thing)\n\nMost games will boil down to either getting snowballed and be done in 5 minutes, or players that want to pad thier xp and will turn it into a meat-grinder that is frustrating as all hell, lasting upwards of 30 minutes being farmed for kills. often those matchs can be won because the famers fail to creep properly, being too busy farming kills.\n\nEach game will reward u with bitz for unlocks both a win and a lose supply the same amount, so its better to get steamrolled then get meat-grinded.  The unlocks themselves are hit or miss and with no way to know beforehand or try stuff out.  And since you only get 1 per level you gain.  So poor luck choosing upgrades = sad tromebone.\n\nSo all and all, frustrating beyond words, aggravating in the extreme, and ♥♥♥♥ this game.

Today I will give you my rundown of Minimum.\nMinimum is a fast paced minimalistic combat game. When I say minimalistic, I mean it in a good way. The blocky theme gives it its own unique feel to it, something completely different from call of duty or any other FPS. Some will say "This is such a rip off from minecraft" when in reality, Mojang has not trademarked squares. Suprising, I know. It is not imitating minecraft for increased profit, it is not scamming roblox out of its share of fame, it is redefining fast paced combat, with minimal graphics that don't jump in your face screaming "LOOK AT ME, THIS IS ART, NOT A GAME!". My point being, this is combat at the core.\nI purchased this on sale for $5.00, and I am very pleased with it, especially since there are so many things that can and will be expanded upon.

It's a third-person shooter with block styled graphics. A lot of people are sick of blocky games, but I think this one looks pretty great. The game is not very expensive but offers a lot of fun. But be aware, currently a lot of people are having issues launching and connecting to matches. If you get it you might not even be able to play it.\n\nEven though the game left early access it's still as good as in beta. Lots of missing features, and still quite some issues. Still, I still think the game is worth it in its current state. It will only get better as the developers add new features and fix issues.\n\nThe current game has 3 modes, the main mode the game tries to focus on is the titan mode. You have to escort a giant robot trough the map, where it will fight the enemy's titan. Once a team's titan is destroyed, creeps will spawn. Players have to kill these creeps and collect their drops to make their next titan stronger. If a titan destroys the other team's titan, and manages to push forward enough, it will face a defensive wall covered by turrets. Once this wall is destroyed the current, and possible next titans won't have to deal with it again. The titan will face one more wall, and then get to the other team's base which will cause your team to win. Sounds pretty simple, but it's really fun.\nOther modes are a simple team-deathmatch, and a co-op horde mode.\n\nWhile playing you get to upgrade your weapons and armour by collecting drops you get from other players, the ground, minions or destroyed titans and walls. You will see the armor you buy appear on your character, and your weapon will become stronger and more awesome as you find upgrades for it. When you die however, your weapon resets to a lower level. While you get to keep your armour.\n\nEvery weapon and armour has its own stats, you have to unlock new ones with in-game materials you get by completing rounds and missions. Currently it's kind of grindy, but this might be fixed in the future.\n\nThe game does have microtransactions, but only for re-skins of free weapons and armour. These do give stats you'd have to grind for without paying, but it's not that bad really.\n\nOveral the game is a nice little third-person shooter with a lot of fun features, and even more to come.","September 16, 2014","true","6.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The swords are overpowered and the only weapon in the game worth using if you dont want to be ♥♥♥♥♥ over and over again by other sword users. all other weapons are terrible, the launcher is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke. How dare they compare this trash game to quake, unreal tournament, Moba's etc.  Dont waste your money the game is trash and will likely fail.\n\n\n10/10","May 14, 2014","true","2.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

Many options are not in the game yet and are greyed out. There is also a clear showing of gun advantage as the higher level weapons are way better then the lower levels. Dont get me wrong this could me an amazing game as it has a really good idea but just made it poorly.\nAnother thing to note is the microtransations, yes there are microtransactions in this B2P game. Isn't that just a little too greedy? So the game is extremely hard to progress in the early stages as people who has bought OP weapons and swords will just ♥♥♥♥ on you. They also need to tone down the swords as 75% of the players in this game are just sword maniacs who dash behind you and you are dead before you even know it.\nI really did want to like this game as it looked so good, but i just can not enjoy it in its current state!","January 31, 2015","false","3.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monogon/recommended/214190/","Monogon","Multiple Goldes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Monogon/","65 products in account","Alright, gotta be honest here, I've considered this one of the better games I've played, but it's got its own problems just like any other game..\n\nIt's got fantastic graphics despite being presented to you in only blocks. The hit animations, procs lighting, ambiance simply all fit too well together into one image. The map designs and the UI are extremely clean, very fitting to the modern style of 2 dementional shapes devoid of depth and complication.\n\nThe unique ingame level-ups are also very innovative and revolutionary, it brings tactics into play, thus promoting a whole new level of metagaming. Along with the flashy good looks. Your gameplay also changes as you progress through leveling your weapons, instead of the monotony presented in just about all other games, minimum presents fluidity. The game also offers you 6 loadouts you can customize right off the bat, and then swap around freely in battle, giving the players an incredible amount of flexibility.\n\nYes, competitive play is viable in minimum. Nothing's significantly better than any other thing, And kills arn't awarded to the best camper in town, but rather to who can control their character to their heart desires, and outplays their foes on an extensive level.\n\nHowever... Its grasp extends beyond its reach, the game is simply too awesome to have such a fatal flaw. Which is quite a shame, but nonetheless fun. It simply can't hold a playerbase because the progression system is so poor to the point of none existent.  Level has no meanings other than a badge of dedication. All the items in you've so diligently worked for are worth nothing, as anynoob just starting off the game can easily purchase'em off the market for less than $5 in total. Nor is there an ELO rating or dedicated competitive games, which completely shuts off the competitive scene that should be but thriving as we speak. Because the skill spectrum in a typical match is so diverse, an experienced player would quickly get bored as he mows down the wave of charging newbies, whereas on the other hand, the new players would feel bashed upon. Leaving no fun for both parties.\n\nNew players would leave so quickly because they have to put up with the monotony upon reaching level 5, as there's probably acquired all the guns they found cool when starting off the game as the point of interest deminishes, the incent to keep playing lingers...\n\nThe game may appeal to retro gamers from quake back in the ol'days, where being skillful is all they need to have fun.. But however, times have changed. In our times, it's all about having and preserving a uniqueness that solely belongs to each individual player. In which case, you developers reading this should base your business model off of. A typical example would be CS:GO, or Blaclklight : Retribution (my favorite game). Because the quantity of their items (or skin) hast became astronomical, and the price range of them vary drastically from a few cents to maybe even over $1000. It keeps people attracted because we always want to work for something better than what they have, and the fact that there's almost always something better than what they have. If you make 10 different skins for each weapon, and each of them being 10 times more difficult to acquire than the latter.\n\nThe game also desecrates the point of having "skins" for weapons and armor, in any other game, a skin is meant to be unique, it's meant to be difficult / expensive to get as a trophy of dedication, but no that didn't happen.\n\n\n\nIt may appeal to oldschool gamers.","February 15, 2015","false","62.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Titan mode has 2 teams of players doing battle at the feet of giant Titans.  As the Titans do battle one will die at the hands of the other and begin to march on the fallen Titans base, fighting its way through defensive walls and turret fire.  The team being attacked must focus on killing the Titan before it reaches their base and ends the round.  If both Titans are downed the game switches momentum toward the "creep spawn" phase, where small NPC creatures begin to spawn around the edges of the map.  Kill the creeps to power up your Titan for the next Titan battle, keeping an eye out for the Golden Creep for extra power.\n\nThe game starts you out with 6 available loadout slots, and a basic arsenal consisting of a sword, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade, and deployable turret.  More weapon options open up almost immediately as you begin to play and spend currency earned in game (no pay to unlocks) to unlock and craft new weapons.  Weapons range from Titan killing giant swords to swords that heal your after a kill, to new versions of the sniper rifle and a few launcher weapons.\n\nOnce you've chosen your loadout and begin the match there is still some customization and and specialization to consider.  At any time during the match you can hit the M key and open the armor crafting menu.  Each round you start out as a naked block man, completely capable of getting kills and winning the round, only without the bonuses and negative effects that come with the armor sets.  Armor bonuses range from increased Titan damage, ability to double jump, increased run speed, to increased damage and more.  Now that you've entered the match, crafted a piece of armor, and got a kill you can pick up the power orb dropped by the enemy, evolving your weapon and increasing your power until you are killed.  For example, if you are wielding the sword weapon and grab a power up orb, you are now dual wielding swords and look like a bit of a badass.  Power it up further to wield two flame covered swords and strike fear in the hearts of anyone you can sneak up behind.\n\nSo, grab a load out, craft your armor, kill the enemy, power up your weapons, and defend your Titan until it's time to creep farm and make the final push on the enemy base!\n\nI'm writing this review an hour before I leave for work and I can't wait to get home and play some more.\n","May 14, 2014","true","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Shame, because the core game was kinda fun too. Alas, as this game proves, just because you know how to use UDK doesn't make you a programmer.","February 15","false","0.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"
