Very few games give me a headache when playing them.  This is one of those games.\n\nThis game really needs someone with incredible patience to create a video walkthru just to explain how to play this crazy game.   So far no one has done this.  Not sure anyone will.  I'm sure as hell not going to try.  I didn't even get through what I think was the tutorial before giving up in frustration.\n\nI got to a wall where it said hold W to climb wall.  Uh no.  That doesn't work.  Not at all.  You have to use a combination of hitting W and the space bar in the right way to get up that wall.  And that is provided you didn't waste energy sprinting around and stuff.\n\nThe game doesn't bother to tell you that sprinting or using your "jet pack" consumes energy.  And if you consume too much energy, then you cannot get past the next obstacle.  Too bad.  What to do?  Hit X and autodestruct and start over.  My first attempt I did just that in trying to get over that stupid wall, where I didn't have enough jet pack whatever to get me high enough.  Except I didn't know to hit X, until I accidentally hit in randomly hitting keys on the keyboard.  There is a way to get a list of the controls, including the magic use of X, but it's not obvious why you would want to autodestruct, so it's easy to overlook.\n\nAfter the wall, I got to a switch of some kind.  I tried everything, but I could not figure out for the life of me how to flip that freaking switch.  It's probably some use of the E button with the cursor positioned just so, maybe with CTRL mode on, maybe not.  After futzing with it for a few minutes, I decided I no longer cared to play this game.  It was giving me a headache.  And not the fun kind of a headache either.  If such a thing exists.  No.  This is get an aspirin and not ever play the game again kind of headache.\n\nThis game might be playable, or possibly in some alternate universe, enjoyable even, if you had any idea of what you were doing half the time.\n\nThe game boasts that it is the hardest sci-fi side scroller.  Ever.  Yeah right.  Having a game where not enough time was taken on basic stuff, like spelling or creating a descent tutorial, doesn't make a game "hard", it just makes it "unplayable", or more precisely, "frustrating to the point where you don't want to play it anymore".\n\nAs a side note,  it's kind of amazing really how bad the spelling is at times.  Instead of the word "destroy", you have "destrov".  Instead of the world "following" you have "follawing" and so on.   But I digrees and I'm getting yet another headache even thinking about all this.","November 5, 2015","false","0.5"," 52 of 58 people (90%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","90","52","58","9","1"

This is not a game for playing -- this is a game for uninstalling and avoiding. This game is only for those keen on regurgitation. I think – no, I’m positive - that this is the most unattractive game I have ever played in my entire life. You know, in the short time I played this, this game demonstrated every loathsome characteristic of bad game design and even discovered a few new ones. It is visually repulsive, and intellectually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Charging money for this is morally reprehensible, vulgar, insensitive, selfish, and stupid. The game has no purpose, a lousy sense of functionality and is broken in every sense of the word. I played Busby 3D, one of the worst platformers ever made, CortexGear:AngryDroids makes Busby 3D better, more enjoyable by just existing and lowering the bar.","February 14","false","2.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","15","16","5","0"

I believe that I got it for free, but even at that price I would strongly advise against getting it. The developer's claim that this game is the "hardest sci-fi shooting side scroller ever" is certainly true. In fact, it is so hard that it is unplayable.\n\nGraphics: Terrible. The game is in windowed mode and takes up about 1/3 of the screen which is useless. The resolutions are bizarre and nonstandard. The background is patchy and looks like a game being run on windows 95. It's so badly optimized that it lags dreadfully even though it's a side scroller with essentially one moving part.\n\nGameplay: I think I got stuck somewhere during the tutorial section of the game. Certainly there were parts which seemed like tutorial, but it was still incredibly difficult to glean any instructions from what was on screen. At one point I had to hack a computer. It told me to press "pause, storage, info" to know how to hack a computer. When I did this it simply said "melee attack can turn on the rage mode". This didn't seem very useful so I tried to work it out myself for a minute or two before giving up and coming to write this review.\n\nStory: N/A. The only fragment of story I got was a strange voice during the load up screen saying "I will destroy you". One of many background voices that seemed to bear no relevance to anything within the game. I had a mission at one point "Destroy every droids in the ruin". Just one of the many grammatical/spelling errors within the game.\n\nSound: As mentioned before there were weird voices/sounds popping up in the background with no discernible purpose.\n\nOverall, a dreadful, dreadful game. Never buy this.","March 3","false","0.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is truly, utterly, and completely awful.\nThis game starts with you looking at a list of instructions. These instructions are not for what you are doing now. They are for what you WILL be doing. There are also several dozen spelling problems.\nFor the first several seconds after loading, the screen will flash in a headache-inducing manner.\nIf you manage to think to look behind you, you will find the main menu, where you can start the game. Maybe. If you can figure out how. The 'start' button seems to allow you to choose which save file you are using. It does not, in fact, start the freaking game.\nFrom what I can tell, the 'Alpha Simulation' button is what starts the game.\nThe first time I managed to actually start the game, my character fell for a few seconds, died, then exploded. Then the game froze because it doesn't seem to understand how to handle the character dying. Though I'm not exactly sure what the heck I did to start the game in the first place, because I didn't use the 'alpha simulation' button, but instead clicked around for two minutes in utter confusion before it began for some reason.\nThe second time I got it working, I did use the 'alpha simulation' button, which brought me to a long, very gray area with lots of boxes. There was a wall on the left, a wall fairly distant to the right, a few platforms, and a green thing in the middle. It told me to press F, and after I stood precisely on top of the green thing, it did... something. I'm not sure. It made a little green pillar thingy. I'm still not sure what it is.\nThen, background things started moving around. I moved around some more and found nothing of interest to interact with. I tried attacking the green thing, to no avail. I noticed the top right corner told me to press m. I pressed m, and saw an overview of the level and found I had the ability to spawn things in. Now I'm getting somewhere! A weapon, another droid thing... Some ammo... Some... Well, not much, actually. Basically nothing of use. I picked up the weapon, and shot the other droid because I think it attacked me (I honestly can't say for sure).\nThen, I kinda jumped around and waited and wondered what in the world is going on. Nothing seemed to actually be happening.\nThis continued for a while as what looked to be some kind of city approached from the background and connected itself to the boring gray box I'd been stuck in. Unfortunately, I had no idea whatsoever as to how in the world I was supposed to handle this new dimension. After attacking the green thingy some and jumping around a lot, I closed the game so I could look at the controls again. The controls did not help. I fruitlessly started the alpha simulation once more before I just gave up because THIS GAME IS USELESS. I HATE IT. I HATE IT MORE THAN ANYTHING.\nI SPENT ELEVEN MINUTES OF MY LIFE ON THIS USELESS PIECE OF TRASH AND I WANT THEM BACK.\nEdit: I forgot to mention one of the other 'features' in this useless thing. If you happen to press the wrong button (it's either x or c, I'm not sure), your character gives up on life and self destructs, which will always cause the game to freeze. Enjoy.","January 28","false","2.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nirantali/recommended/375620/","Nirantali","NeXuS23","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nirantali/","335 products in account","Yet another "Powered by Unity" Game biting the dust.\n\nIt started in a tiny Windows with no Option to change the Resolution first, it captured the Mouse and auto-clicked which caused flickering, then after finally finding the Resolution Option somewhere, there is No Fullscreen Option and the max Resolution is 1900x950 which is, well certainly not a default Resolution.\n\nAlso the real Challenge is to actually start the Game, because a Click on Start does nothing, you need to click hack save or something to actually start it and what you get then is an Empty Level where you fall down on the left and can slowly, very very slowly move to the right, where you then get a Wall you can't pass, that's all.\n\nAnother strange Thing to mention is, it starts in 3D but the actual Game is a 2D Side Scroller, looks like there was some Decision Problem if it should be a 3D Game or not. So the Mainmenu is in a 3D-World where you hear some Monkey, but after managing to actually start the Game it's a 2D Side Scroller that probably play on the Moon or so. You only see such mix-ups in "Powered by Unity" Games for sure.\n\nIf you click all Buttons on the Keyboard in boreness, because nothing is going on and you click "C" you see a little Explosion and "Signal Lost" and the Game freezes with no Option to go into Main Menu or what ever, only Task Manager can help you out then.\n\nAlso the Game has No Controller Support, so anyway unplayable for me because i started it on TV, but this doesn't matter because it's only another "Let it run, Trading Card Collector Game". So the purpose of this Game is to start it, let it run and come back after some Hours to exit and delete it.","January 8","false","2.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
