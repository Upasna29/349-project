A malliciou Chinese warlord blitzkriegs it with an Ethopian army of child soldiers and african- I mean Shadow Warriors.  Using Aurora Borealis. our heroes teleport themselves themselves away and end up landing in a different continent in the city of Kardia, where capitalism. misogyny. and science exist. (I swear it's not America)\n\nTrapped in these new lands, without their magical universal healthcare, they must find a way back home before they die of mana-deprivation. Along the way, you get to experience the sociological analyzation of societal and culture developement as a result of resouce scarcity, AI and human morality defining what is 'human', environmental psychology, philanthropy vs patronage and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of other things I wouldn't have expected from a what I thought was going to be a $15 lucky star. Now they must journey back, gain experience and retake their capitol before the enemy scores a domination victory on the other civilizations.\n\nI bought this game because I thought "This art looks pretty, if this was an anime I was watch it."\nSecretly this VN contained Mozart level music and was so indepth with it's discussion of politics and culture that I had to look and see if this was a Paradox Interactive game. The writing is fluid, detailed and never dull, and the characters alongside their stories are livid. It contains alot, ALOT of feels pertaining to loss, repentance, forgiveness.\nIt has Clannad level emotional scenes. It's an extraordinary story and I will be buying the second milestone.","July 23, 2015","true","9.7"," 222 of 246 people (90%) found this review helpful 141 people found this review funny","90","222","246","141","9"

As the duo managed to escape from the Melano's party, they got teleported (shift) to the other side of the world. Their journey began as they want to return to Ruzenheid and confront the opposing mysterious party that is supposingly lead by Melano.\n\nTrying not to spoiling much on this review, -milestone one- is mostly focused on the mysterious character named Rune/Sara and "her" dark pastime. The story started light-hearted but more and more mystery comes up later on and the duo is determined to solve this problem regarding Rune/Sara despite the limitation that is imposed to their body because they are running out of natural mana to supplement their body. Do note that the ending of this VN is quite sad (like CLANNAD-ish sad) and twisted (how twisted? Just play the game :^)\n\nThere is only one choice in the VN which serves as turning point of the story. The characters are likeable and the story gets darker and more interesting starting from Chapter 5 as more foreshadowing are created that will pique your interest to finish the story until the end. Lots of action in the beginning of the chapter but it might get a little bit information crunch towards the end and a big plot twist at the ending.\n\nThe UI for this game is very fluid and vivid. I was amazed that this was actually done on Ren'py (props to Sekai Project for porting it I guess) but it's kinda feel too bad that this amazing VN is not voiced. The art is well done ESPECIALLY the main menu artwork, I kinda wish that they have some 1920x1080 artwork but all of them are 1280x720, it's not a bad thing but it leaves me wants more of this epic art. The soundtrack that plays along with the scene are reaaaaallly well done, it helps build up the atmosphere for the situation pretty well especially that one time on Rune's madness scene!\n\n8.8/10 a must buy Visual Novel, some of my interpretation of the story might be wrong because my Japanese is not perfect (since I play the beta build) but it's enough to make me immerse myself in the story (it actually have some hard kanji too so yeah :^))\nIt would be a 9.3/10 if it was voiced but it's already great in its current state. Definitely recommended if you like the classic Sci-Fi theme that mixes kingdom with magic and stuff.\n\nNote: I was asked to put spoiler tag for the screenshot I upload because I finished the game on the beta while everyone still waiting for the english translation. Yes, that's how interesting and eager I was on reading this VN ~\n\nAlso, Melano & Mharo are qt3.14 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)","December 15, 2014","true","30.1"," 85 of 91 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","85","91","6","2"

I'd definitely recommend this game to people who enjoy a story about family but also about how we as humans can be oh so different in where we grew up but at the same time be oh so similar to one another.

[Just for the audio elements area]\nFault is a Science Fantasy Kinetic Novel developed by ALICE IN DISSONANCE, and Published by Sekai Project. With the addition of a new 3D camera system, Fault Milestone one aims to introduce a more immersive and “larger than life” reading experience.\nFollow them on their journey of a lifetime as they try to make it back home to the Kingdom of Rughzenhaide. This partucular VN in my opinion really stood out among many other VNs that I have played I really enjoyed this the most among all that have been released.\n\nThe story A princess named Selphine a bubbly, happy-go-lucky Princess and her sharp-witted but slightly misanthropic Royal Guard Ritona. While attempting to make an escape from a brutal assault that’s devastated their homeland of Rughzenahide, the two mysteriously teleport to an unknown forest surrounded by vegetation not native to the surroundings of Rughzenahdie. The atmosphere is thick and heavy and no sign of life can be found, which is particularly unusual for such a lush forest. Sign of life isn’t the only thing missing though. Something is odd about this land – something is amiss – but Selphine and Ritona are too startled to notice the obvious.\n\nWho were the assaulter and what was their goal? Where did Selphine and Ritona end up traversing to? Will the two make it home safely? And more importantly, what will they come home to once they do?\n\nAudio and Visual elementsVisual elements – All top notch, from character sprites to character designs, backgrounds and CGs anyone who have played or do plan to play Fault series the art is very distinctive. It s eye catching very made a huge impact I loved the mix of colors that were use to bring out each character personality like for example, Purple that signifies royalty, etc.\n\nAudio Elements – The OST all of them are top notch, extremely detailed and fitted in perfectly into its environment and cues in at the perfect timing. Its soundtracks is immersive when playing through this VN it felt that you are a part of it it felt good and it has very good abilities of conveying the mood and situation of the VN. I loved all of them, but there were a few that stood out here is the list of them that stood out, “The divide” and “Sol” (Sol Main Theme) and “Ode Piano Version” and “Homeward Bound” and “Death of dignity” and “Lines are drawn”. I wish I could share those soundtracks but I am not sure of its copyright issues on this matter but I here is a video of its trailer, from it you can tell it is good just from its trailer.\n\nTo sum up Will I recommend Fault series? Yes! Absolutely in fact you should not even give this a miss, missing this is like walking past a box filled with gems and then regretting it later. I am honestly glad I picked this game up, usually after I buy a VN or game I will regret later becasue I simply did not enjoy it and they usually does not keep me in intrest to make me wanting it to reread it but as for the Fault series its different. I have reread Fault milestone one and two 3 times each and I am still not bored at all, despite it being a kinetic novel.\n\nClick here a review filled with images and afterwords at the end[azusantiara.com]","February 6","true","112.7"," 47 of 57 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","47","57","6","1"

That told a story of a princess and her royal guard on a quest to go back to their kingdom after escaping it due to an attack. The story took place in a science fiction+fantasy world. Since this is a novel with visual and audio, i'm not gonna talk about the gameplay since there is none.\n\nThe writing i gotta say is both superb and kinda lacking. First, you are introduced to this grand and epic fantasy world fill with manakravte (Magic) and medieval enviroment just like normal fantasy universe, but after the main protagonist get teleported away to different land, they introduced us to a new world with few manakravte, but the people in the new land adapt to it with technology and sciences.. They make it really immersive to the story so we don't feel strange at all with the sudden changes. Apart from that, they did not shy away from mature content, (no, no.. not hentai mature.. But more like dark kind of mature) the villains is portrayed as a mysterious and evil characters that laugh and joke around when they killed their opponents, it feels like all the villains have a real and mysterious personality that we didn't know yet. But I kinda wish that milestone one would focus on the princess conflict with this mysterious villains instead on the back story of the third main protagonist which is.. don't get me wrong, that back story is really great and touching, it fill with the story of somebody struggle against the hardship of life, family love and issue along with a nice twist that makes us gripping on our seat trying to put the pieces together, the character interaction in that back story feel really realistic. But.. It feels like it doesn't belong in the main plot. Like when you put a Pizza on a steak, they both taste really good, but its strange to mix them together. Its also really strange that they invest a lot more on this third main protagonist and her family more than they invest on the princess and her royal guard. In the end, we know a lot more on the complexity of the third main character and her family personality more then we know on the princess and her royal guard. I thought the princess and her royal guard is the main protagonist.. But in milestone one, strangely they feel more like a side character than a main character. Aside from that, the battle scene.. Well, the only battle scene in this novel, is really epic and exciting. I really can imagine it really happening inside my head with the help of the visual, writing, and the audio. I say its a good writing if you can make your reader imagine it in their head.\n\nThe visual of this game is really clean and gorgeous, it whats makes me want to try this kinetic novel in the first place. What makes this kinetic novel different and better than alot of kinetic/visual novel out there is that they make a character sprite for nearly all the character that speak, even though they only speak in one scene. That's a huge plus for me. aside for that, they change the background scene constally even though they re-use alot of that background scene for alot of scene.\n\nI really recommend this kinetic novel because this is the type of japanese kinetic/visual novel story that a lot of people can consider a good story without actually a fan in anime or other japanese stuff. I'm sure a lot of my problem with fault milestone one will be solved in the sequel, because the ending tell us that milestone two will be focused on the main plot that is still full with exciting mystery. Besides, the writer and the designer is really talented at their job and i really excited waiting for the sequel to be released.

I noticed that female characters look more typical animeish and that the males look somewhat westernised. Mind you you that's not a bad thing, it makes for a good contrast.\n\n+I really like the interface. You know it's there but it's kinda out of the way and only comes up if you want it too. Some people have complained about the font and in hindsight, yeah it could be better but while playing I did not complain.\n\n+This game is the first in what I THINK will be three games or "milestones", the story started out a little generic but the way it goes about it and the themes it deals with ends up making the story VERY interesting. Until the other games come out I can't say the story is superb but I'm itching for more so that's a good sign.\n\n+The verse has some nice backstory and details with an encyoclopedia to boot. Mind you it's no where near mass effect level, but considering this is essentially made by a couple of people in Japan, it's pretty detailed.\n\n+The sound track at first sounded decent. Nothing stood out too much though, UNTIL it got to the more serious scenes. OMG the way they use the music in this is amazing, made me get goosebumps a couple of times which leads me too...\n\n+RIGHT IN THE KOKORO....I'm a guy, but i had to shed some manly tears at certain scenes..jeez..\n\nOn a scale of 1-10 I give this game a 8, BUT I would give it a 9 if it fixed those 3 big issues and a 10 if I had a good closure in the story.

Good, notable music that I would enjoy even outside of the game.\n\nSTORY The lore is impressive and enticing. Rather than the typical fan service filled, hormone driven storyline, It revolves around a world in which mana is used and manipulated by specially skilled individuals. In addition, it is very focused on society, politics, and foreign culture.\nAs to not spoil, I won’t delve too deep on the storyline, but admittedly, it does feel a bit lacking.\nHowever, it is excusable, as it is the first novel of the series. Because you have to understand the basics of the lore to fully enjoy the novel, you will find that you are mostly being introduced to the main characters and the way this world works.\n\nCONCLUSION In the end, it feels a bit lacking and short, but you do gain a firm understanding of the world in which our lovely characters exist.\nIt leaves you hungry for more and provides a perfect stepping stone to the sequel, which I bought without hesitation.  (Click here for my review)\nI fully recommend Fault Milestone Two, more so than the first, but Fault 1 is absolutely crucial to understanding the whole story.\nI’d recommend purchasing both if you’re interested in a well written science-fantasy visual novel.","April 25","true","6.2"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","17","19","5","2"

During my 1st encounter with the demo I was immediately hooked by its outstanding Intro, theatrical story, and breath-taking moments that I could barely wait to finish the demo. Instead, I went to steam and purchased it right away without a second thought.\n\nCombined with hundreds of hours gameplay in Final Fantasy XIII, XIII-2, and hoping The Lightening Returns could ever come to steam short after, this is the only game I play when I need a break from FF XIII. It just wields its mysterious power that can capture me.\n\nAs a visual novel lover, I had played thousands of visual novels through the past 12 years.  I love reading just as much as the air I need to breathe in.\n\nHowever, when the games refer to the subject like magic with fantasies, I’d hardly list anything like Fault Milestone one that has offered me.  If I had to recall, the last time I had something amazing like this, it was back to 2004. There was a game called Fate Stay Night (I believe) made me felt the same way. And it was heavily involved with sexual contents (which could never and ever get on steam with its full version); I died a lot due to the little knowledge to understand advanced Japanese.\n\nIt’s really a shame that I’ve walked passing by Sekai Project Studio for several times, wandering around but never knew what it was. Now I am becoming a big fan of it just for saying thank you as one of the leading roles on steam who introduces Visual novel to its large audience towards western society.\n\nVisual novel just had its start on Steam; the show has opened a prologue. Don’t miss this precious stone before it vanishes into an ocean deeper than the Atlantic Sea.\n\nScarlet's Score 8.7/10\n","January 27, 2015","true","23.1"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","18","21","2","2"

Felt some feels.\n\nMusic: Pure (synth)instrumental with a touch of electronics and light beats fit the magitech setting well. Battle BGMs certainly did justice to their scenes and the suspenseful scenes had creative BGM too. Probably the strongest aspect of this visual novel.\n\nWriting: I'm afraid to slap a "very original" label on this VN even though the entire read was a very refreshing experience. Other Japanese games have probably used similar ideas and themes before. Let's instead say that it's extremely inspired, in all the best ways. It's certainly written and localized well if you forgive a few typos here and there. Some of the ideas brought up in the story were fairly ambitious since they touched on subjects that are barely understood in real life but were honestly addressed fairly thoroughly in this fictional world with its unique metaphysics. The characters were all memorable and smartly utilized in progressing the story.\n\nArt: Nothing to scoff at really. You'll like it if you like anime style? The style is a bit inconsistent but there might have been multiple artists in which case it's sort of understandable? Proportions are weird at times? Why is that girl's neck so long in that one CG? Maybe she was trying to be an alpaca.\n\nWhat else? Oh it criticizes androcentrism. Yeah.

I may have even been tipping to the negative side of the scale when it came to things like anime. That all changed when I, for some reason, found myself on the steam store. Now let me tell you, I'm a frugal guy. I don't like to spend money. You can see that by the amount of hours  I put in on F2P games. I just don't have anything else to play lol. So here I am, on the steam store because I was bored. I'm shifting through the recommended games in my queue, when something catches my eye. It wasn't the flashy Fault logo or Selphine's blue eyes: no. It was a certain purple-haired, crimson-eyed, black-clothed girl. The first thing that went through my mind when my eyes were graced with the privledge to gaze upon her was, "Damn, she's cute." So me being perverted or possibly just curious, decided to take a peek at the page. What I saw impressed me. Since the only anime I've seen is Death Note, and I've only seen the first 8 or so episodes, I stereotyped all animes to be like it. Dark, bleak, and depressing. The screenshots totally blew me away, and it was probably the first time I was excited to do anything related to anime. I downloaded the demo for the game/kinetic novel to give it a go. Utterly mesmerized by how much of a badass Ritona was, I immediately threw away all thoughts of frugality and basically begged the steam page to take my money so I could experience more of this amazing story. Please, AiD... I need more Ritona. I can't imagine life without her. Everything would go back to being so old, and bleak, and Death Notey. And to you, reader. Sorry for breaking the fourth wall but buy this game. Don't go out into the interwebs and pirate this. AiD deserves the money and needs it to make more novels about Rit- I mean Selphine and her journey back to Rughzenhaide. Don't let us down. Buy the game. Do it for this poor soul writing this review. Do it for Ritona.\n\nP.S.

I got everything I needed for my trip back home. Then I met Sara and Rudo who answered some questions but left more in their wake. In an act of desperation I went to a lovely cemetary to ease my mind except when I met her there. Ever since that day i've never felt a chill run down my spine so unnerving as I did that day.\n\n10/10  Would grave dig again.\n\nEdit: December 27 at 3:54 a.m.\n\nI have now finished the story in its current entirety.\nMy first review was indeed meant to be funny and foreboding at the same time but now that i've been through hell and back I will write an honest review of the Visual/Kinectic novel.\n\nPros:\n\n1) The story is great and you can tell that there has been a lot of time and effort put into making the story as relatable and engrossing as possible. The character developement is on a whole other level and there is indeed much you need to learn about this world. Each character is flawed in their own way just like we all are and each one has their own ambitions. The relationships between all the characters are incredibly complex and in my own opinion make it so that you truly care about the fates and decisions that the characters are destined to make.\n\n2) The music is beatiful and never bothered me. I can't remember who the composer for Fault Milestone one is but they made a soundtrack that made me go from happy to depressed and finished me off with a sense of tension and real unease like so many other games have failed to do. Where it not for the music, I truly feel that the game would have lost much of its splendor.\n\n3) The art is by far of the upmost quality. It is rendered in full 1080p from what my search into the game folders has told me and it feels lifelike to me. I am personally a fan of this type of art mainly because I am an avid anime fan and this art of course is the defacto type to have in an anime. That being said, the mood and feel of the game while largely expressed by the music and story is perfected by the art. Without it I don't think i'd have fealt the antagonizing feelings I get from Melano or the suspicious stance I had towards Rune as I read the novel. I really wish there was more art than was provided but I suppose that quality over quantity is always the better choice.\n\n4) The Encyclopedia and Gallery are a godsend! I can't argue enough how enjoyable the game became once I memorized the meanings and importance of all the games complex magics, societies, sciences, and locations. The fact that it was put in here shows how much the creators wanted the audience to become a part of the world as though it was all common knowledge. I even found myself asking how it was that the main characters didn't know such simple information half way into the game only to remind myself that I had access to information they didn't storywise at the time. To me that will always be a plus.\n\n5) The story is quite long actually. I was surprised when I read another player's comment saying the game was too short but after about 5 hours of playing the game I truly believe I got my monies worth when I pledged to help this game be translated on Kickstarter. Always remember "Quality over Quantity".\n\n\n\nCons:\n\n1) The translation was done quite well and it managed to get all the crucial moments across without a loss of emotion. Yet there were a few moments with Kudo's and Albey's dialogue that had broken english which would easily have been corrected with one last pass through quality assurance. Those few mistakes actually ruined the mood for me as it violently yanked me away from the story when I tried to understand what they were saying.\n\n2) Unanswered questions......While not a negative thing I really wanted to know what had happened in the homeland after Melanos attack. I wanted to know if the Alliance amassed its forces in an attempt to help our heriones people or if Melano has led them towards war.\n\nAll in all I give this game a 9 out of 10. (Worth every penny I invested in Kickstarter)\n\nEverything about it is great and it has so much more left to offer since it is part of a series. The unanswered questions are just a pet peeve of mine so they won't affect the game rating. Lastly I know the game is in beta right now so I will replay it once the full version is out and if they corrected the spelling errors then it will receive my full "10 out of 10 rating". Mind you that the only other games to receive that rating are. Bioshock, Bioshock Infinite, The Half Life Series, Heavy Rain, and Infamous.","December 25, 2014","true","8.3"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silvachief/recommended/286260/","Silvachief","Silvachief","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silvachief/","190 products in account","Christmas seems to be the season of visual novel releases this year with a number of recent completed translations. fault –milestone one- is the first project worked on by ALICE IN DISSONANCE, a group with the goal of combining western storytelling with eastern art. While I think the success of that particular goal is debatable, fault is one of the better short visual novels I’ve read in recent memory and certainly isn’t a bad addition to the current line-up of VNs available on Steam. Despite some issues with pacing, grammatical mistakes and inconsistent visuals, fault’s interesting concepts and endearing characters make it worth your time and earn it a tentative recommendation from The Geek Clinic.\n\nManakravte, the use of purified energy found coursing through the veins of the world and all living things, has characterized life in the Inner Pole for as long as anyone can remember. It has enriched every aspect of life, from creation to communication, and when the capital of Rughzenhaide, one of the region’s kingdoms, falls under attack, it allows the princess Selphine and her protector Ritona to escape with their lives intact. They are whisked away by Manastreams flowing underneath the soil and emerge in the last place they would have thought possible. The Outer Pole, the Godforsaken Continent, is a place where Mana has never been plentiful and people have had to struggle to merely survive. Using the mysterious discipline known as ‘science’ to harness what little Mana they can get their hands on, those of the Outer Pole have developed massive corporations and technology that the royal pair have never seen in their homeland. On the journey to return home, they meet a happy, bubbly girl by the name of Rune who agrees to show them around. The locals don’t trust Manakravters, however, and any caught in the Outer Pole risk suffering Manashock Syndrome.\n\nI immediately found fault -milestone one- interesting because it takes the time to establish the importance of Mana and Manakravting before whisking its readers away to a setting where those ideas simply don’t apply. Rather than feeling like I had missed out, however, the contrast between the areas described earlier in the tale and the reality the characters faced kept me that much more intrigued by what was going on. What starts off with a grand premise and a great deal at stake becomes something smaller without losing its importance, which I thought was quite well done; there’s an emotional component to the lesser scale that allows you to connect with the characters that probably wouldn’t have worked its way into the production otherwise. My problem with the story itself is that, after having built up the problem to be faced and prepared the heroines to face it…it kind of just goes away by itself, and suddenly at that. The ending and epilogue are a tad too rushed for my liking. Additionally, the short length of the story itself means that it lacks the impact of a longer title, so while the experience itself is satisfying it fails to leave a lasting impression.\nWhile it’s difficult to evaluate the quality of characterization in a visual novel of fault’s length, I can say that there was enough room left for future releases to develop the main characters and allow readers more of a chance to connect to them, which is something that didn’t happen for me in this first instalment. This is one of those times where character development has been set aside to focus on a story that will grip readers, which is only okay because there are sequels planned. Strangely enough, it was the side characters that were given the most time in the spotlight (no, that doesn’t make them main characters) this time around, and their personalities and motivations had been well developed by the end of the story, even if they felt a little contrived (only a little, mind). In any case, I felt that any of fault’s deficits in character development were made up for by the events surrounding those characters and keeping them on their toes, so there aren’t any major issues in this area.\n\nfault’s technical aspects present us with a mixed bag. On one hand, the package itself is very well presented, with the UI, visuals and feel of the OST fitting together very well. On the other, character and CG quality is quite variable and it’s very apparent which components have had more time put into them than others. Some characters have fantastic clothing designs and natural poses/expressions, while others come across as a little lacking in both departments. Either way, the art isn’t top-notch, high definition stuff like you may have seen in longer releases but it is easy on the eyes in its own stylized way. Having played the full release and not a beta version, I have to mention that a number of grammatical errors and typos were present. While there weren’t enough to ruin the experience, I noticed them in more scenes than not which isn’t really acceptable for a commercial product. Hopefully these issues will be fixed up in future patches, however, so I haven’t allowed them to affect my final score. The background music, while not something I would seek outside of the visual novel, fits each scene it is used in well and is pleasant to listen to, adding positively to the experience overall. There’s no voice acting to speak of, either, which is a bit of a shame.\n\nSummary – All in all, fault –milestone one- makes for a satisfying and interesting experience but has little lasting impact. The story is interesting and somewhat unique, if not to the same degree as other, bigger titles. While I may not be crying my praise from the rooftops I enjoyed reading it and am looking forward to the planned prequel and sequel visual novels. This is a story and setting that could do very well in episodic instalments that lead up to a massive finale, so I sincerely hope that we will see it develop over time.\n\nScore: 7.5/10 - Enjoyable\n","December 27, 2014","true","7.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Truth is, I knew nothing about this series until I tried the demo out. Not only did the demo give me a surprising amount of gameplay (about half the entire episode), it interested me enough to buy it immediately so that I could see what the rest of the story was about. And I was not disappointed.\n\nfault reminds me of Long Live The Queen in one aspect: They both have an outward cute and lighthearted appearance, but when you delve into it you will end up in a very dark place of violence and madness. And while you get a glimpse of this evil in the first few minutes of fault milestone one (cute anime girls committing mass murder), the true descent into the abyss comes later on (with a fair amount of it making its way into the demo). It certainly deals with some heavy subject matter and the darker aspects of humanity, to the point that I wonder if the works of Key/VisualArts were a source of inspiration for ALICE IN DISSONANCE. This, of course, would not bother me in the slightest.\n\nfault milestone one however is not perfect. Good, perhaps even great, but not perfect. I liked pretty much everything relating to plot, world-building, and the characters (Ritona being my favorite). The artwork and soundtrack are fantastic, but that just makes the lack of voiced characters disappointing since those probably would have been great too. I don't really mind the length (~6 hours) since this is only the first part of the story. Nor am I too much bothered by the fact that you only make one inconsequential choice during the entire game (like Planetarian, this is a VN with a story to tell, rather than one that the player sets up through their choices).\n\nNo, what I do mind about fault milestone one is the rather abrupt way that it ends, leaving the reader/player with many unanswered questions and forced to wait for the next installment which won't be here for quite a while (Fall 2015). It's like Telltale's Walking Dead, except the episodes are longer and so is the wait between them. :(\n\nSo if you are willing to put up with waiting a good while before seeing where this story goes next, then giving this a look may be worth your time. ALICE IN DISSONANCE and Sekai Project, whether by accident or design, have provided us with one of the largest (in terms of size compared to the full version) demos I have ever seen. So if you are even remotely interested in this game, check out the demo. If you like what you see there, then picking this up would be the logical next step. As it was for me. :3\n\nOr you can wait, possibly a very long time, until the entire game is released on Steam. Either way, I hope to see more of this series! ^_^","January 30, 2015","true","19.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/286260/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","TL;DR: Science fantasy kinetic novel with gorgeous art and both psychological and philoso-scifistic themes. I read it in 6 hours.\n\nSpoiler-free review.\n\nThe first part of the fault - milestone series introduces a world setting not quite unfamiliar from our own. The main difference is the inclusion of mana and the associated magical powers, which work as an additional set of physical laws for the world. Being a kinetic novel, the story is linear and there's only one ending.\n\nIt's a science fantasy world\nMana is infused with everything in the world and used instead of all those modern-day items and technology we are familiar with, sometimes in surprising ways. In some ways, the magical technology is more advanced than our own. This allows that many concepts akin to science fiction can and will be explored in the course of the novel.\n\nStory explores both these ethereal concepts as well as mundane ones. Problems of faring in unknown lands and dealing with mental disease are discussed in surprising detail, the latter associating with the more morbid side of the malady. One of the more esoteric topics explored is the very concept of sentience.\n\nI found the characters to be very likeable. The protagonists, Selphine and Ritona, fare from an apparently utopian kingdom of Rughzenhaide, rendering them extremely liberal and naive in outlook. The main storyline about the mysterious mana industry company and its associates is both sad and fascinating. In the end I even teared up a bit.\n\nEven though the story curiously begins with them, only the antagonists of the story are left unfamiliar and distant, perhaps to be explored in further installations. The perplexing and slightly annoying thing about most (though not all) characters is them being teens or at most very young adults. Maybe this peculiarity fares from the manga style.\n\nTechnical near-perfection\nCharacter artstyle is obviously of the familiar manga style. If you don't mind that, the art is generally excellent, background scenery looks good and characters have several facial expressions for dialogue. The camera is used dynamically in the narration: it zooms in and out as fits the scene or dialogue for dramatic effect, a technique I liked a lot. The only technical imperfection is the total lack of voice acting.\n\nSoundtrack is excellent for a visual novel. Twenty (20) different tracks are used throughout the novel to set the mood for each scene. If only they were integrated into Steam Music player since the soundtrack would fit for listening for fun or as background music for reading.\n\nReading at its finest\nI read the whole thing in some 6 hours. In addition a few hours was spent on listening the soundtrack, reading the encyclopaedia and idling a quirky achievement. I read the English translation (Japanese version is also available).\n\nWriting in English is very clean: I don't think I saw any typos during the whole read. Only few expressions were confusing or hard to understand (English is not my first language), probably because the royalty tends to sometimes speak in elaborate fashion instead of being wrong.\n\nConsidering I got it for 66% sale I feel I got more than I paid for. I was rather surprised of how much I liked it. So yes, I can recommend fault - milestone one! In doubt, there's a demo available in Store and as I said, you can get it for relatively cheap.\n\nBe warned though: it ends in a juicy cliffhanger. Afterwards, you might be inclined to get the sequel, fault - milestone two:above as well.","April 20","true","13.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

As such, it's basically just a story with accompanying music and anime-style art, rather than a game per se - there's only one choice, and it has no real impact on the overarching plotline.\n\nThis first episode in the series does a lot to introduce the setting and develops into a surprisingly emotional story about a girl named Rune that Selphine and Ritona meet almost immediately after arriving in the strange land they teleported to - amusingly, a bit that I take issue with in the store description of the novel, because Ritona and Selphine do very little in the way of trying to make it home safely during the course of milestone one!\n\nAnyway, it gets a thumbs up for having a plot twist that actually surprised me despite the fact I really, really should have guessed it was coming, and also making me really look forward to the next part, where hopefully the heroines will actually get somewhere! ;)","December 16, 2014","true","7.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This can be quite overwhelming, but rest assured that you will learn which and what in details as the game gradually progresses. Based on the general consensus it has seemed like a lot of players agrees that the font of the game is pretty unsatisfying to look at.

If you were expecting a game that focuses on one overall plotline... much like how typical asian style drama shows do... then you may be a little disappointed.  Instead, you should expect something more episodic, much like American drama shows like CSI.  There is an underlying major plot, but the focus will be more about the subplot.\n\nThis is the only real "fault" of the storyline... that it is just the first part of the adventure.  You may not feel strong attachments to the main characters as you read through it from beginning to end.  This is a natural flaw of both good storytelling and releasing your work in a matter of series.  Character development is slow, yet steady, as it should be.  If this sort of thing bothers you, I would implore you to look at this series later when more episodes are released.\n\nFor those that don't mind, the intro of the game almost makes you expect that this will be a sort of generic JRPG stereotype.  Beginning with all of these cute anime girls with their own quirks almost feels somewhat stereotypical.  I almost expected that it would be the kind of game where every charcter is a girl... but I was pleasantly surprised when even that had an answer of it's own...  Let me say this, the writer put a lot of effort into worldbuilding... the world itself is organic and full of life and complexity that far surpasses most current storylines I've seen to date.  The last good well fleshed out world I've experienced was the Type-Moon universe... and that work is nearly ten or more years old.  So how can I sum this up?\n\nPros:\n* Amazing music\n* Complex and fleshed out world\n* Emotional and thought provoking\n* Not your typical generic story\n* Focus is episodic oriented rather than saga oriented\n\nCons:\n* Only first part in an incomplete works\n* May feel a little generic at the beginning of the game\n* Focus is episodic oriented rather than saga oriented","July 24, 2015","true","123.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

[At least People within the VN would call it Science-Fiction..., wouldn't they?]\n\n"Btw: My Opinion in general is based on milestone one + milestone two"\n\nI found this to be a truly amazing display of story-writing. Even if it is not Voice-acted the music fits. The style of art leaves no room for further wishes and I loved the turn of events when it came to the actual plot about Rune/Sarah's background.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversuriv/recommended/286260/","silversuriv","silversuriv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/silversuriv/","1360 products in account","==== Review ====fault milestone one is a medium length (~5-8 hours) fantasy kinetic visual novel that display gorgeous artwork and an enjoyable soundtrack. Starting off with an invasion and assassination attempt on a manakravting nation's heir apparant, the novel quickly takes you to a new land across the world where science dominates a mana barren country. Compared to  many of Sekai Project's other VNs, fault does not focus (nor does it even include) overt fanservice. This game was designed to tell a compelling story with deeper and darker psychological themes. The world of fault is fairly well fleshed out with information presented on the history and society of the nations, along with somewhat acceptable guidelines/theory regarding mana (magic) usage.\n\nAlthough fault is a well produced and designed VN, I am really disappointed in the game's second half. With an active start to the story involving battle magic, the pace comes to a complete standstill after the MCs are teleported to another land. The game then shifts to introduce a family with a tragic history. Some of the chapters were way too longwinded and a solid couple hours of gameplay could be reduced by removing repetitive/redundent lines or shallow scenes attempting to fabricate a strong backstory. I was definitely not a fan of this half of the story, even though I understand the developers' desire to introduce a new POV character. The weak dialogue left a lot to desire, and encumbered my playthrough even more as I tried to slog through to the end.\n\nThe game includes traditional VN options as well as a sound gallery. There is only one ending, and although the achievements are easy to attain, one requires repeating a scene 50 times, and another forces you to stare at a CG scene for 2 continuous hours. Two annoyingly designed achievements, though there are ways to cheat them.\n\n==== Score ====fault one is easily one of the best fantasy VNs on Steam atm; although there is a severe lack of competition. Be sure to checkout the direct sequel fault milestone two side:above. For anyone that may be on the fence about this series, both games offer demos on the store page to tryout.\n\nVery Good\n- 8/10","May 18","true","4.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I honestly cannot wait for 'fault milestone two' to come out!\n\nIts a futuristic, science fantasy, adventurous, dramatic and psychological Visual Novel. It puts you in the situation in which you have to find your homeland Kingdom of Rughzenhaide before you run out of time, this happened all because you used a teleporting device that wasn't fully tested...yeah smart move eh...During this time, you encounter many things like a A pawn shop that doesn't sell any stones A so-called friend called Rune/Sara and many more! They could've at least made it more interesting though...but oh well, that’s all I can say without spoiling too much plot.\n\nGraphicsThe Visuals are awesome, I liked the art style they put into this, especially in the Opening song.\nOverall 10/10\n\nStorylineExcluding any potential spoilers, the storyline is pretty solid. It has some parts where it gets a bit confusing...like all psychological things, but its all straightforward when you know what your dealing with. You definitely read this VN for its plot, nothing else. There is no lewd/ecchi in this VN\nOverall 10/10\n\nSound/Voice/CharacterThis is where the VN loses its stride. The sounds are fairly simple, it didn't impress me at all and at points the same soundtrack is played over and over again, I would've like it, if they added more soundtracks in the game. The characters could've also been a bit more "smart" with the situation in hand and with the choice provided that was not possible to achieve. Apart from that, the voice acting was pretty good, no errors there.\nOverall 7/10\n\nPriceAnother VN with the price tag of £11. I gotta say, its worth it for its price right now, I honestly would pay more, but I got it on sale when it first came out. Its still worth the price in my opinion.\nOverall 10/10\n\nI cannot wait for  Fault Milestone Two","March 29, 2015","true","13.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I had my doubts about the medium's storytelling ability, honestly. I get it now.\n\nThe first thing that hooked me wasn't even visual, though. The soundtrack is amazingly powerful. It nails the emotion of each scene perfectly, and I found myself lingering at times just to enjoy the music more. Characters are refreshingly rational throughout, which was the next element that stood out to me. It was nice to see science back in the sci-fi, even if it just happens to be a simple acknowledgment of evidence, or lack thereof.\n\nI enjoyed the art style as well. The character design is good enough where I don't think they necessarily had to go the "every girl has different colored hair" easy mode route, but that's the way it is and I'm not complaining. Speaking of the opening girls though, were they used to hook a certain type of audience into a better story? It worked, but I'm eager to see the continuing volumes engage with them again.\n\nBut this story.. it took me by surprise. After the opening chapters, I was starting to think that maybe it was biting off more than it could chew. Sure, I was interested in the world and the characters, but how was it going to answer all these questions I'd accumulated in a satisfactorily scientific way? Then, one by one, they were answered. Some elements that I wasn't even expecting to be acknowledged were later given a spotlight. I'm sorry for underestimating you.\n\nNegatives? There aren't many. I felt that some of the localized dialogue choices pulled me away from the fantasy world. It was only a couple times, and a very minor complaint, but I noticed. UI isn't super polished, but it worked just fine. Again, minor complaints. Seasoned VN readers might prefer choices and routes; this is linear, or kinetic. Still, I was satisfied in that regard.\n\nWhat a fantastic experience, though. I can't even buy half a volume of manga for what I paid for this during the summer sale, and I actually feel bad about that. I'll be taking advantage of their Patreon, hoping to make up for it. Wish I'd known about the project when it was on Kickstarter. I highly recommend Fault Milestone One.","July 4, 2015","true","11.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I've tried the likes of the Higurashi and Fate series, both of which were undeniably very good, however Fault Milestone One delivered something that other VN's simply couldn't. The world in which the Fault Milestone series takes place in is just so utterly fascinating to me, I mean I've always been a huge fan of the fantasy setting, but the way magic or "Manakravte" is potrayed in this game just makes so much more sense. The characters are all fantastic and stay away from the typical anime tropes I've learned to absolutely hate. At some points the story felt like it dragged and got boring, but the payoff at the end made it all worth it.\n\nIf I were to list the definite pros and cons, it would be as follows:\n\nPros:\n- Excellent characters\n- Interesting plot\n- Fantastic world/settings\n- Good art\n\nCons:\n- Writing was pretty bad in some parts, it's bearable, but definitely detracted from the game a lot.\n- The plot sometimes got boring (entirely subjective of course)\n- Short\n\nOverall, if you're thinking of picking up this game, I'd definitely recommend it. It is one of the best Visual Novels on Steam at the moment.","May 3","true","6.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I woud like to go in details about this, but I don't want to spoil the fun of making a discovery to potential new players. But I can say one more thing - it's filled with various emotions and it surely won't leave you emotionally untouched.\nThe translation quality is very impressive, text is very fluid and each sentence follows other with a flow, which only English language has (I am not a native English speaker).\nSo, if you like kinetic novels and fantasy settings you should go and try this one.

Is. Gorgeous. The main menu is especially striking, though there's nothing quite as vibrant and sweeping in this first milestone proper. That's all that really needs to be said about the visual presentation of fault. It's just solid all around.\n\nAs for the story--and speaking in strictly vague terms so as not to spoil anything--you're presented with an effective hook in the introductory chapter. The high action doesn't last long, though, and the original impetus for the plot is set aside rather abruptly in favor of a pseudo-mystery adventure; one that, frankly, would feel like filler in an anime were it not for the last half-hour. The pacing is a bit awkward in these early parts and drags in the middle, but the story does a reasonable job of holding the reader's interest, thanks in large part to an endearing cast of characters.\n\nThe writing is decent, marred only by the occasional syntactic stumble and typo. The world of fault and its rules are detailed and fairly easy to understand thanks to the fact that almost every aspect has a parallel to the real world or its history. The presentation of the world, however, is done clumsily. The flow of the story is broken at several points by exposition-heavy monologues that, while interesting, encourage impatient skimming more than dedicated reading.\n\nNarrative issues aside, if you enjoy character-centric stories about love and loyalty, I wholeheartedly encourage you to give fault: milestone one a chance. The coming milestones promise adventure on a much grander scale, full of beauty and heartache. But I'm confident that the narrative will continue to focus on our heroines; how they will change (and be changed by) the world during their travels.","January 4, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, I did modify the writing to make it more fitting for a video, but it's mostly the exact same as it is written down there. The differences are, really, just minor things.\nSo if you prefer listening over reading, watch the video instead! Thanks!\n\n-sigh-\nIt really pains me to give this visual novel a negative score, I really want to like it. Trust me.\nBut it's not giving me a reason to.\n\nFirst, lemme go over the positive things I have to say about this visual novel:It has an amazing artstyle, which does a good job of replicating the Japanese/Anime artstyle. I feel like a lot of passion & love went into drawing this entire visual novel, from all the colorful backgrounds to the unique indiviual characters, it all looks very pleasing to the eye, especially those "special scenes", for example, Ritona vs. Koko.\n\nI also feel like the soundtrack of this game is just fantastic. It's all so full of energy, fitting each and every scene so well. It's so good, I wish I could purchase the soundtrack, really.\n\nAnd lastly, from the 2 or so chapters I've read through - the story has an interesting enough premise and seems to be pretty good..\n\nBut...that's about it.\n\nNow, what did I mean by "it's not giving me a reason to like it"? You love the way it looks, you love the way it sounds and you like how the story (so far) is set up, so what gives?\n\nHere's my answer:I don't like the way it's executed.\n\nNow, I understand that Visual Novels in a nutshell are supposed to be books, just presented in a different way. I understand that completely well, but I've played other Visual Novels (for example - planetarian ~reverie of a little planet~ is one of them) and the way those VNs kept me interested - is with the way they were executed. The VN parts were animated and voiced, which kept my mind active whilist reading them.\nAnd fault milestone one is not animated, nor is it voice acted. It's completely silent, 100% of the time, while you watch a picture of a character change to match the situation.\n\nI can understand why they left this out, I mean, getting voice actors & animators for a game must be very expensive and I'm certain they emitted this because they wouldn't be able to afford it.\nThis is just my personal preference, to be quite honest.\n\nI also don't like a few character designs. Once again - nitpicking. I said I loved how this VN looks, but there are a few character designs that I don't like. Here's what I mean - this is Melano, the leader of the bad guys of the story, and this is how we see her for the first time. Looks really freackin' sweet, right? And then, this is how she looks from the in-game VN cutscenes (third one from the left). (picture credit to Chudah) Suddenly, it feels like that creepy, villanous vibe I got from the first picture turned into more of this...old woman's, joker-ish vibe. And she's not the only character that gives a different impression than the original meetup, Ritona applies here as well.\n\nAnd those two reasons alone are why I just didn't find fault milestone one a very interesting Visual Novel to just continue reading on.\n\nSo, in conclusion, the reason I'm giving fault milestone one a negative review is because I am not a fan of the silent execution & the character designs leave too different of an impression each time. The entire "silent approach" with just the BGM playing makes my mind fall asleep. I lose interest. And is solely the reason why I don't recommend it.\n\nBUT!If you don't mind having a totally silent Visual Novel as well as non-animated cutscenes, then, honestly - go for it!\nLike I said, the story (at least from the two or so chapters I've played through) is (so far) really interesting! It's set up not too badly, the songs themselves are just pure sex to the ears & the artstyle, besides the aforementioned character designs, is really good! The complaints I have about this Visual Novel are just personal ones and please, don't let this review make you decide whether or not to buy this game. I was merely offering my explanation on why I didn't enjoy fault milestone one as much as I thought I would.\n\nWill I read more of the Visual Novel in the future?It's hard to say, but I'm certain that, one day, I will finish it. And who knows, maybe when I get around to doing that, I'll change my review.","August 2, 2015","false","3.6"," 77 of 148 people (52%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","52","77","148","10","9"

A VN, especially one like this with only one choice to make during play, lives and dies by its writing - and I'm sorry to say, the writing here is not very good. Overly wordy dialogue takes forever to get to the point and worse, 'sounds' unnatural which makes its characters difficult to invest in; they don't feel like people, they feel like boxes labelled 'sad backstory' and 'exposition'. While this could just be a problem with the English translation, the level of craft that went into the plot itself seems to suggest that clumsy writing is a Thing here. I like to get my emotions played with as much as any VN reader, but I do not enjoy it when a game grabs me by the shoulders and screams at me to LOVE THIS CHARACTER, DAMN YOU!!! which this game does in spades. It feels forced.\n\nThe art is passable: nice bright colours and lovely backgrounds are a joy to look at, but some character designs are hit and miss. Thankfully, the principle characters are all very well-designed, so the less appealing designs will hopefully not show up in future chapters. Sadly, unless the quality of the writing improves substantially, I won't be bothering with those future parts of the game.\n\nSorry if this review sounds harsh; I didn't HATE the game. I just think it has a lot of missed potential.","May 21, 2015","false","2.6"," 25 of 47 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","25","47","0","0"

And this one nails it right on the head. The music is moving and adds a lot of extra depth to the scenes.\n\nArtwork is wonderfully done and the backgrounds seem to fit the tones of the scenes well.\n\nStorytelling in this was quite good and really sucked me in resulting in me reading more then half the novel in one sitting. At the beginning I was lead to believe it was going to be strictly fantasy but that changed after the first chapter into a mix of that and sci-fi. I thought that it actually worked out quite well, as they molded magic and the uses it could have as a energy source in a more technological society. Keep in mind this isn't future tech its more industrial revolution era tech. The novel is however pretty short, I finished it in ~7 hours. I am a pretty quick reader though.\n\nSome of the scenes were quite dark which I enjoyed a lot. They really built up to them and they left you truly horrified of the events that occured and were set to occur in the aftermath.\n\nOverall I think this is totally worth your time reading and would totally recomend it to anyone who wants a light read.","October 4, 2015","true","7.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I thought I would be reading the tale of the princess and her guard's journey as they try to make their way back home. What I got instead was just the first episode of that, all told about some local intrigue they find at the first city that they come across on their journey. And, what a story it told...\n\nI wouldn't call the story particularly innovative, but a story doesn't necessarily have to break completely new ground to be good. It wasn't a greatly emotionally moving piece, albeit there were some rather touching moments. There were definitely some interesting philosophical themes explored during the course of the story, though not in any great depth as they were merely another piece of the story. However, the weaving together of the different threads of the story was nicely done, such that when the pieces started to all fall into place, I found myself clapping on a number of separate occasions.\n\nfault milestone one isn't your typical VN where you are given choices that affect your progression through the story; it's a single storyline that you follow all the way through. There's a single choice you're given at one point, and it only changes some dialogue without changing the flow at all. It doesn't bother me at all; what's the difference between that and reading through a regular book?\n\nThe graphics serve well in accentuating the environment of the story. Some extra sprites and more backgrounds would have been nice to see; the number of locales felt a bit sparse, and that's likely due to the budget. The art is quite good; can't call it spectacular, but it's by no means mediocre or sloppy. The music is also well done and matched nicely to each scene. It's always a good sign when I find myself wanting to listen to the tracks again after hearing them while reading, and I've loaded up the game just to do that from the music gallery.\n\nMinus points?\n\nCharacters are a bit over-the-top at times. To be expected from this genre, granted, but it does feel a bit jarring when it happens.\n\nThe technobabble (thaumatobabble? whatever term you use for its magic equivalent) infodump at the very beginning was a bit much. Thankfully once that was out of the way, it only throws in the odd term here and there throughout the rest of the course of the story. And there's a handy encyclopedia provided in case you need to check on the definitions.\n\nThe biggest? It's a bit short. I'm a very fast reader, and I went through the whole thing in roughly 3 hours; somewhere between 5-10 hours seems to be the norm for most people. And of course, this is only the beginning of the story, being the first episode!\n\nLooking forward to fault milestone two!","July 25, 2015","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/makure/recommended/286260/","makure","Makure","http://steamcommunity.com/id/makure/","158 products in account","I highly recommend Fault Milestone to anyone who loves kinetic novels or is interested in getting into them.\ntldr: Excellent story, art, and music, but no choices, which is upsetting to some people. FM is a story, not a game.\n-------\n\nBefore I go into a real review of Fault Milestone (which I will refer to as FM for most the remainder of the review), I need to delve into a couple of points.\n\nFirst and foremost, this is a KINETIC NOVEL, not a visual novel. This confusion is often the source of negative reviews of FM.\nThe difference between a kinetic novel and a visual novel is small, but significant. A visual novel is a text based game accompanied by visuals. The story will have several points where the reader has to make a decision, and thereby influencing the flow of the tale. The most common example of this is the dating-type visual novel, where your choices as a reader will ultimately change which of the pursuable characters you date/marry/etc.\nA kinetic novel is also a story accompanied by visuals, but almost completely lacks choices, and the choices that are available do not change the flow of the story. The exclusive aim of a kinetic novel is to tell a story, and not be a "game". It is a term that most people are unfamiliar with, so I understand why FM is labeled as a visual novel (I doubt there was a tag for kinetic novels when FM came to steam, or even if the tag exists now), but if you go into FM expecting choices in the story, you will be disappointed on that front.\n\nThis leads to my second point. This is more of an angry rant targeted towards a particular type of negative review, so feel free to skip this next bit.\nI have read a number of comments that sum up to "well, if all we are doing in Fault Milestone is reading a story with pretty pictures, why didn't they just make it into a movie/comic?"\n...This particular question grinds my gears a bit, because the focus of the person asking the question is off and unfair to FM. The first reason they ask this question is that there is no real game mechanic to FM, as I addressed above. This leads to the mentality of "well, why are you telling a story in a video game-type media? Why didn't you just use (insert more typical story telling medium here)?" And this is where the heart of my gripes lies. This implication of this question is that a kinetic novel is not a valid story telling medium. If the asker did view it as a valid story telling medium, the question would seem just as absurd as asking "Why wasn't (comic book title) just done as a picture book?" or "Why was this play not just done as a movie?". It is because the creators of the story chose to tell their tale in that given medium.\nI guess what this boils down to, for anyone bothering to read this, is that you need to view Fault Milestone as a story, not as a game. If you judge it from the perspective of a typical video game, you will unfairly judge FM.\n\nThat being said, kinetic novels, like visual novels, manga, comics, and so on, are not for everyone. If you really aren't looking for a story, or if this medium isn't for you, that is entirely okay. Just be aware of that when/if you go into Fault Milestone.\n\n\n...\nNow that THAT is squared away, I will review Fault Milestone.\n\nVisuals- Excellent. There was a lot of work that went into this game, and you will be treated to more than stills of characters. There are a number of full screen images, all of which can be viewed in the game's gallery. And while the art is manga-styled, it deviates from what people stereotypically expect from anime-styled art (thanks, Sakura series). No fan service shots, no girls with watermelon boobs, no "uguu". The art is very tasteful. The only character that starts to encroach the stereotypical manga art territory is Selphine (the blonde princess in the title card), but it is very infrequent and not at all overwhelming when it does occur.\n\nWriting- Again, excellent. Writing is the most critical aspect of any translated story, imo. Even slightly awkward translations can take away from the atmosphere created by a story. Fault Milestone does not have that problem. The writing is excellent, and if it weren't for a few Japanese culture hints in the script, I would never have guessed that this was translated into English from another language. The only clarity issues that arise are some errors in dialogue, where the name of the character currently speaking is wrong. But that is more of a formatting error, not a problem with the writing.\n\nCharacters- I personally like them a lot. Again, Selphine is the most tropy character, but even she has a lot more going on that most characters of her trope (read Fault Milestone 2 above, and she gets even better). Every character is well done, and more than just the reskinning of a trope (which is what many of us have come to expect in stories).\n\nStory- Beautiful... I cried... twice. Basically, you are thrown into FM during a castle invasion, where the two main characters, Ritona and Selphine, manage to get stranded in their escape and must try to make their way home. Saying much else will start to spoil things, so I will say no more.\n\nMusic- I love it. If you end up playing FM2a, I even suggest buying the soundtrack. Even if you don't get the soundtrack, you there is a gallery section that has all of the music for the game in it.\n\n\nOverall, I find that FM is an absolute necessity for individuals that enjoy kinetic novels, and a great one to start on if you are new to them. If you don't like reading and aren't much of a kinetic novel person, you can pass on this, but if you want to give them another shot, FM is a good place to begin again.","January 25","true","15.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And yes, this type of fantasy VN will be perfect with VO.\n\nThe whole game quality standard is fine. No issue performance wise, has standard VN options like text speed, you can even use controller to play leisurely in your bed. There are an option to even change the language to Japanese if you prefer.\n\nThe story, however, if you look as it stands has big question mark in it. The main plot we see at the start of the game is left unanswered and has no progress until the very end of the game. The subplot, which is introduced around half hour into the game, though, is well expanded and written quite nicely. Don't get me wrong, the theme is good, and although the ending is in cliffhanger, the conclusion to the subplot is satisfying. It just takes a whole different approach to present the story, and some might find it upsetting. After all, I can't find any comparable game with the same technique of story telling like this.\n\nAs a whole, I can definitely say I won't buy this full price. Luckily though, it's now bundled as per 30/4/2016 on bundlestars (where I got a copy of it) and have seen big discount as a part of Steam's anime sale.\n\nIf you're into casual game and love VN genre, give this a go. My personal score for the game is 7/10, lack of VO, short story and cliffhanger ending are my major complaints.","April 29","true","12.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I used to be kind of aghast at them until I played Blazblue and realized that I was starting to get annoyed with all of the combat scenes in story mode.\n\nThe VN has some very glaring grammatical issues but nothing earth shattering.  The basic core and setup to the overall world is pretty generic.  Magic, people use mana, etc. However what fault does very well is create a compelling character portrait of a character that calls herself "Rune," the introduction and explanation of whom is essentially the entire arc of this episode.\n\nThe game ends on a cliffhanger, but only after firmly resolving the episode's central storyline.","January 25, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The writing is, quite surprisingly, eloquent and natural, despite the use of rather elaborate diction coupled with the fantasy science of "Magickrvte". The artworks are first-class too, but these you can judge for yourself from the trailers. The storyline starts as a tale of war and peace, of mercy and ruthfulness, but swerves to touch the theme of identity and humanity.\n\nIt should also be noted that unlike many other VN, fault - milestone one is very polished, from the main menu to even the slightest animation or sound effect.\n\n"A possibility for compassion..."","January 1, 2015","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Taken to rehashing Tolkein clones, it has lost any sense of fantasy. For me, fantasy is a sense of awe, wonder, and fascination with an unprecedented premise. It needs to have a "wow" factor that seduces the audience into the intricacies of its world so that it can stand on par with the complexities of reality. Moreover, fantasy should behave something like a daydream: an entertaining diversion which is grounded in the issues of the day, yet is not afraid to give itself wings in liberation.\nHonestly, Fault is the first series that has made me feel like "fantasy" stories can still be written- and written very well; the writing in here is way above the par of any visual novels I've read.\nThe characters are tight, well-developed, and placed at the center of the story. The locations are varied and showcase different aspects of the characters, in addition to being well-detailed (you could almost say that it's a story about places as much as people). Serious social issues are handled without seeming trite or contrived. The art is gorgeous and the sound design produces some rivetting moments. Really, you should play this.

Even with elements of magic and fantasy, the story feels real, every character is memorable in their own way and the ending had me almost crying. It's a good length, I finished it in just over 8 hours, so it doesn't feel drawn out or too fast paced.\n\nThe ONLY thing I disliked about Fault Milestone was the lack of decisions. Some other visual novels have you make lots of decisions that take the game in new directions. During my read of it, there was only one choice. Even so, I would not consider the lack of decisions as a fault in the novel, it tells an absolutely brilliant and fantastic story, even if it does so linearly.\n\nI very highly recommend Fault Milestone to anyone, even those who have never read a visual novel.","January 2","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I think giving/reading a plot synopsis will ruin the enjoyment because world building is one of the main attractions. I  recommend the demo  even if you're slightly interested Just know that main characters have great chemistry together, are all likeable (Ritona's my fav), and never do any thing illogical or infuriating. The art and characters are gorgeous and what first drew me in. The music is on point; all the tracks accompany the scenes and have a magical fantasy vibe that fits the theme and setting very well.\n\nThere are a few Faults in Milestone One...\nThe beginning of the story may overload readers with new terminology and can move too fast. I wouldn't worry too much as a lot of the terms come back as the story progresses and are reexplained to the player, and there is always the encyclopedia in the pause screen. The climax also happens a bit too fast for my liking, but had everything I wanted to see.\n\nI don't see the following as faults, but people should know that this is a static novel. I don't remember any animations or flashy effects that grabed my attention. There is no voice acting. I don't see these as standards for visual novels and won't dock Milestone for lacking them.\n\nFault Milestone One was able immerse me into its world and made me care about the main characters.

Really really good characters in fault milestone, that are surprisingly 3-dimensional, and thus create a very captivating story. There were only 3-4 grammar mistakes throughout the entire thing, so it was translated quite accurately. The music was wonderful, and was able to define whatever the current mood should be, and thus compensating for the lack of voice acting or animation. 10/10 Would reccommend for anyone looking for a good read.

I actually started crying at one point (a scene towards the end, you'll know it when you see it), and the set up for the next game, which is already in my library ready to play, was very intriguing.\n\nThis game goes into a few of the issues we have. It presents a perspective where there already exists, what we might call, a perfect society. This is where the two main characters come from. Then the game contrasts that society with a persona of our world (well, America at the very least). This created a strange sort of feeling as I was reading in which I felt that things could be so simple but they aren't. That doesn't really make any sense, but I was just really pulled in by the story and personalities of Fault milestone one. After a point, the reason for Rune's existence is not to difficult to discern, yet I still felt a sense of satisfaction when the characters figured it out. And just when you think it's all over, of course, we mustn't forget about the antagonists that literally started this whole thing in the first place.\n\nOn a side note, it did sometimes feel like there were two different people doing the character art. Or maybe the artist put more work into some drawings than others? Regardless, the art was beautiful at best, acceptable at worst. I'd say that's fine considering I like the story. Voice acting obviously would have been great, but I finished the VN happy so who am I to complain?\n\nBasically, I thoroughly enjoyed this game, and I'm off to play the sequel. It was hard to explain my feelings without spoilers, so just go play it. I mean, it's only 5 bucks right now.

I am not sure what would change if I had picked the other choice, but I suspect little.\n\nAs novels go, it's quite nice. Very rich world building, albeit I was thrown a bit off balance with the sudden shift of location/cast; the villians established so early on aren't relevant for the rest of the story here, as they are the antagonists for the series as a whole, not this part.\n\nThat said, part 1 really solidifies the feel of this new world, and it doles out humor and drama in nice bite sized chunks. The change of the title screen after completing the game is a nice touch.\n\nAs I have played the demo for part 2, and it looks to be shaping up to be so much better than part one, I can safely say Part 1 is a good purchase; right after I finished it I was unsure what to think, as the story had written some checks it had yet to cash. Part two hits the ground rolling, and reassured me immediately that nothing in part 1 was frivolus or wasted in that sense.\n\nThe price point is only 15 dollars, and standing alone I wouldn't have called it a good buy, but this was always intended to be part of a greater series, so the lack of closure was to be expected. What's been shown so far of the next entry (since the first entry sold so well) has earned my faith in the rest of the series. Buy this, play it, and grab the free demo for Part 2 and play that.

It lacks in voice acting, which is either a plus or a minus depending on your tastes. It also takes the world it creates very seriously, to the extent that it includes an encyclopedia to help you understand some of the terms (which aren't English, but are honestly close enough for me, but others may not feel the same.) It ends on a cliffhanger and there is currently a part 2 out there, but I haven't tried that one out (but I will). I feel like this is the best way of handing a VN, as it manages to incorperate multiple perspectives and the reader gets the best understanding that no other character could. Not everything is spelled out for you, especially with there being quite a cliffhanger, but the story itself has a lot going for it.\n\nA major problem with the VN genre is that the music is very much hit or miss. I will say, I genuinely enjoyed the music here. You have to actually finish the story, but you unlock a gallery that also includes the entire soundtrack, albeit within the VN itself. I actually prefer this myself over the concept of paying another 5 dollars for it. The game itself is kind of pricey, but I would say if you enjoy the genre of VNs, pick it up. If it's your first? It's worth it, but wait for a sale. This is a rather expensive genre for the newcomer, after all.

I have watched countless hours of anime and enjoy manga so I don't know why I waited so long to try out VN.\nFault: Milestone One was a gift to me solely based on the genre and positive feedback on the game. I have to say "thank you!"\n\nIt is beautiful, elegant and deeply thought-provoking. The intro is stunning and gives a different feel compared to other VN I have played. It has all the components of enjoyable VN/anime/manga while engrossing you into a new, yet familiar world with these two characters. The writing and music is new and intoxicating, driving you through turns of tragedy, hope, darkness and light.\nI love that the story allows you to potentially feel and understand all the characters rather than just the main ones. The question of morals, ethics, compassion and the 'what what you do' scenarios keep you reading.\nThe only negatives I have is the every now and then mis-translation (or maybe I should just finally learn to read Japanese) and the fact that I have to wait for the next Milestone.","June 22, 2015","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This was my first time as a virgin to the genre.\n\nAnd I am not dissapointed.\n\nTo anyone trying to get into the Visual novel flare, this is your thing, it is exactly what it says it is, a visual, novel.\n\nIt may seem a little underwhelming, where are the light sabers, where are the tactical rpg elements, where is the sword and sorcery?\n\nWell there is none, if you're not into that kinda thing then this genre in general probably wont be for you, nevermind this book.\n\nSo, as a book, since thats what I regard it as, how was it?\n\nSpoiler free opinion:\n\nI rather enjoy stories that have depth, this one didnt dissapoint, with a beautiful art style, an epic soundtrack to accompany it, I found myself deeply engrossed into this novel all the way from the beginning to the end.  Its 6 hours of my life well spent that really pulled me into the franchise and has me excited for the future.\n\nIf I was to give a few minor gripes, the translations are a little awkward but I can forgive it since the context of the story was still relevent.  It also lacks VA which, while I dont necessarily find that a bad thing, reading the entire thing from start to finish can be a chore for people that dont have any patience.\n\nIt also teases you with the idea of a choice half-way through the game, though I dont think that the choice actually affects the ending or the story, it seems ot be more of a personal preference.  That might make some a little dissapointed since it railroads the experience but what a railroad it is.\n\nThe story takes us from start to finish on a rollercoaster that constantly makes sure that your reminded of events previously so you dont die of boredom like most novels might throw at you.  This series made me cry in the first volume alone a few man tears of empathy towards the progression and characters in this story.\n\nThis stories strongpoint is how much a persons life can change and what gives them the ability to do so, it also surprises you with depth from anime steriotypes that might be cliche at first only to completely catch you off guard later.\n\nAs to its ending? The mother of cruel teasers for the next episode that left me squeeling "god damnit I want to know what happens next!"\n\nI really "really" enjoyed this as a first timer to the visual novel franchise, I avoid Harem and Reverse Harem for a reason and I was glad to find what I was looking for, a visual novel in the purest sense.\n\nAnd I am not dissapointed, at all.","January 11, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/286260/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Fault milestone one is the first game in the fault series and a Visual Novel where we follow the adventures of a princess called Selphine and her guard Ritona on their way back home. Upon starting the game we are immediately thrown into a dangerous situation where Selphine's castle has been overthrown and the assailants are searching as to where she is hiding. One thing leads to the next and they manage to make a hasty escape to a far off land. It is a slightly overwhelming and a bizarre introduction to this unique world as characters are bound to go into a long and usually out of place  inner monologue about everything. Seeing a character blather on to herself about something that should be basic to her while in a life or death situation definitely seems out of place and since this does feature an in-game encyclopedia detailing the world and lore, a simple optional link to whatever they're referring to would have greatly helped with the flow.\n\nThe previous event of escaping and arriving on a foreign land is pretty much all that happens within the course of this game. It is nothing but world building and delving into the backgrounds of the characters you meet. The questions on the store page like “Who were the assaulters?” and “What was their goal?” and every other question except where they have landed will not be even remotely answered in this game. Fault milestone one really reminds me of Dragonball Z in that they take forever to do anything as they keep delving into character's backgrounds as the writers keep padding it out until they write the next section of the story. We accomplish nearly nothing and as soon as the story starts to actually go places again it is over on a complete cliffhanger.  I'm making this game sound completely terrible which I assure you it is not, just do not go into this expecting an adventure. All it really is an introduction with no plot advancement after the beginning whose goal is to set up the world, lore and characters for the player.\n\nWe will mostly be learning about the side characters and learn very little about the main characters Selphine and Ritona. Luckily the side characters are all very interesting and memorable, though I really doubt the importance of knowing everything about them since they were children all the way to the present. The world itself is pretty interesting too, featuring both magic and science. Saying anymore would be a spoiler but rest assured this is not your typical fantasy world with anime waifus. In fact it is surprisingly dark and violent at moments so it is a title not to be judged by appearances alone. The art is all really well done and features multiple interesting locations. A rather strange problem with the text is that as if there are multiple lines in one text box the bottom half of the currently scrolling line will be cut out giving a glitchy, really annoying look as you try to read a sentence with the words cut right down the middle. As for the translation to English it is usually spot on with an occasional error or word missing though nothing enough to make a sentence incomprehensible and happens rarely enough to be a minor issue.\n\nThere is no voice acting to speak of and all dialogue is done via text. We are given a “decision” rather early into the game which has no effect whatsoever and will never have another decision to make so it is the type of game where you will just be reading, not one with multiple outcomes or dead-ends. I'm not sure if we play as any character or are just an observer though I'm assuming we play as Ritona since her inner monologue and thoughts are the only ones we can see while not in a flashback. Along with the in-game encyclopedia we also have a gallery for all the artwork and a music player to listen to all the tunes in the game which are definitely worth a listen on their own. It's a shame I can't really go into what makes fault milestone one good as giving even one spoiler will reduce the surprise of an already lacking game. At the price it is being sold at I would have felt really ripped off personally, especially due to that quite shameless ending but it does feature a demo for those curious which is really nice of the developers to add and is sadly pretty rare these days. At the end of the day even though I felt this first entry into the series lacking in both substance and story development I do desire to play the next entry since the interesting characters & world have all been introduced and the pieces of the story are now in motion.\n","March 14","true","9.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Probably my favorite one to date.  The story is quite unpredictable and isn't really anything like you might expect from just reading the Steam store description.  The characters are likeable, it's an interesting universe and the plot is solid.  In the first chapter, it can be a little bit technical describing the various types of mana in the universe, but it really sets the stage for what is to come.  I cannot write too much without giving away plot so I'll keep it brief.  What makes Fault M1 stand out is the fact that it is not overly depressing nor is it merely superficial and overly sweet.  A lot of VNs tend to be very depressing which is fine sometimes, but not really something I seek out. If I want to read something depressing, I'll read some Hemingway.  Instead, Fault manages to convey an interesting universe with just the right balance of whimsy, fun, emotion and seriousness.  In all, a masterpiece.  The ending is a bit of a cliffhanger, but you'll be glad you read it and anxious for the next milestone.

For me, the story has some pretty strong themes, made even better to imagine by pretty good and appropriate music.\n\nThere are many themes covered in this supposed Episode One alone;\nif I were to sum it up in my own opinion, it would go like this:\nMagic vs Magic.\nMagic vs Science.\nScience vs Religion.\nReligon vs Corporation.\nScience vs Humanity.\nFriendship vs Fate.\nFriendship vs Magic.\nNow from those; Fault Milestone One may sound like some a heavy and serious story, but it actually does a nice blend of those themes without obvious jarring. Though by the time you reach the ending of it, a certain story scene will instantly remind you that this is just a prologue and that there will be more episodes, hopefully.\n\nMy only complaints:\n1) No voices.\n2) No plans for an OST release. In my opinion the soundtracks are really good.\nI put in about 3 hours to read the entire Fault milestone one.\nThe rest of my hours? Just listening to the soundtrack.\n(I've asked Sekai Project about the OST in the community hub, you can check there)\n\nThis would make a decent show if it gets adapted into anime.

Don't play this story for a game, read this for a good character drama and that's all.\nI'm going to keep this one short, because honestly  I just spent 9 hours that I halfway enjoyed, compared to the 1000s of hours that I never really enjoyed on WoW. Okay, so fault: failed to capitalize titles is a story about magica girls that get banished from the magica land because of a coup d'état and end up to the place with no resources and lots of suffering where nobody respects magica girls; essentially Africa.\nNow most people would think that they are getting a visual novel, and they're right. For you oktaku (nerds), I know that you miss the days that you could read The Very Hungry Caterpillar by Eric Carle and your mother wouldn't berate you to to get out of her basement (attic master race), but visual novels are pretty ♥♥♥♥ing annoying for me. They ruin any imagination in how I visually construct a character as I would in a normal people's novel. But, a good visual novel uses this to paint a unique picutre that cannot be conveyed through text. What happens in this story? You go full Japan. Great job you Japanese Japaneurs, you uphold the status quo of electric socket eyeballs.\nSpeaking of eyeballs, they actually bothered to explain why some of the characters' eyes are the spawn of Satan. Apparently, it's magic, I'm sorry, mana. Okay, so that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ blue bar that would never regenerate while I get ganked by a rogue is the driving force of the world, and I'm fine with that, I am. But why in the opening section is there no character that I can relate to? The idea when introducing someone to a world with foreign concepts such as magic is to use a character or another entity to learn along with you, to avoid the blight of direct exposition. I never took AP Lit (I dropped out 2 weeks later), but it's really isolating to see all of these characters do these mana whatevers without me getting the context. I know what a shaman does because I spent 50 hours of my life casting lightning bolt and kiting with earthbinder, not because I saw a level 60 shaman do windfury crits for 5 hours straight. The villains come into play and you forget them because the gud gurls use a teleportation spell.\nThankfully, this entire act of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ends and we get thrown into a new land. This new land make it near impossible to cast magic, and the people of this place use  SCIENCE  to power their world. So now we get to learn about this world, and so are those magic girls in the beginning chapter. We, the audience, now have the beneift of vaguely familiar material and a group of people to learn with us. Great! The rest of this story like chapters 3-7 are really good, going over the tradgedy of the great families of this region. This is really the part of the story that I liked, because it has some intriguing tension and drama for a super srs mlg magic girl story that opens  and closes  with.\nI honestly couldn't care about the villains in the beginning, because the middle section was a half decent character drama with qualms that I could understand and characters that I liked like Rudo, whose past experiences with some characters are a hurdle for him to forgive the accident that he was burdened with as a child.\nBut at the end, guess what? Those ♥♥♥♥ing stupid anime villains are back, god damn it. We started weak with the typical magic fight opening where nobody knows what's going on, then a strong middle, and then a massive wave of disappointment at the end with the reminder that this was a magic girls show, with the royal assasination plot rearing its ugly head for a stupid cliffhanger. If the ending was vague, and not this stupid, I would be excited for a sequel. But no, don't get invested into this storyline, the mid section was just a fluke, and the overall storyline bogs down any interest. When it says chapter 8, turn off the game, just leave it there.

More serious than I expected, quite a ride. Quick breakdown below:\n\nStory: Very well done. Managed to get an emotional response out of me, which I must say is pretty rare. Though it started out rather slow and forced, by the end of the second hour I could not put it down, the development is rather bizzare. A point to note that it is very linear, I have encountered but a single choice in my playthrough.\n\nVisuals: Nothing extrodinary, but very nice nonetheless. CGs are plentiful and well-drawn.

One of the biggest criterias for buying a game for me is the artwork (and storyline). I know, how shallow. But Fault Milestone's art exceeded all of my expectations and the CGs were stunning. It definitely drew my attention when I first saw the game. It also had an amazing storyline and it was well delivered. I teared up a bit (a lot) at the end, but that's probably just because I'm sensitive. It had a very powerful message at the end and the CGs complimented it well. The music is another plus to the VN. The OSTs matched the mood perfectly.\n\nBut like all other games, Fault Milestone One also had some cons to it.\n\nCons:\nWhat I didn't like about the VN was that there was not much of a choice in the storyline, but I guess that's to be expected. There really isn't that much to complain about, so I'm just picking at the small details. In the beginning, there was a lot of information thrown at you that you later forgot. I had to look up half of the magic terms the characters were talking about. In the end, it was also kind of confusing because you didn't know who's perspective it was in, or whether it was in the present or the past (a memory).\n\nAll in all though, Fault Milestone was an amazing game! I would definitely recommend it to others. Especially if it's on sale.

It's nice to look at. Really. Presentation is also really good, sometimes even stretching definition of "VN" somewhat.\n+ Story. Theme is very interesting, characters are believable. Plot twists are not very obvious.\n+ World. There is much world-building going on, and it's really interesting, at least for me personally. It's not your run-of-the-mill fantasy world, and much care was put in making it somewhat logical. It's not the case of "it's magic, just roll with it". That said, world-building tidbits aren't integrated very well, so it breaks narrative somewhat.\n\nCons:\n- There is one choice in the whole VN. Which changes effectively nothing. So, just bear this in mind.\n- As I said, world-building can get in the way of narrative at times. Not a huge deal, but can sometimes be a little jarring.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time with it, so a definite thumbs up from me.","February 26","true","8.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I don't want to spoil much because you really have to read it for yourself, but without a doubt if you enjoy a good read that will keep you interested, make you really connect and feel for the characters, and will make you question reality, emotions, and the gap between human and machine, along with thoughtful inner discussions of philosophy, then this is the Visual Novel for you. I'm not much a reader myself unless it's internet documents pertaining to technical and/or historical information pieces but even I couldn't turn away from this, everytime I walked away from it I couldn't wait to dive back into this vibrant and invigorating world so don't worry if you're not a venerable or heavy reader. Overall this is well worth anyone's time especially for the price whether you enjoy the genre or not and serves as a great benchmark for other Visual Novelists, if you haven't already purchased this then what are you waiting for? The story isn't going to read itself after all.","March 4","true","9.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I am terrible at reviewing narratives (like VNs), so I'll just put this in perspective.\n\nI've played a bunch of visual novels, ranging from Katawa Shoujo to Muv Luv (which I despised). Honestly, fault is the only Visual Novel I've ever read that actually managed to be so good I wanted to throw all my money at it. Pretty much everything else out there doesn't compare to fault.\n\nWhy? Well, besides being very well written with lovable characters that succeed at breaking away from generic anime stereotypes, it also has something very dear to me that every narrative should have; a detailed, fascinating world. Of course, it really helps that this world clicks with my interpretations and views of HOW FANTASTY SHOULD BE and such. I guess this entire review is sort of pointless then, because of everything out there fault is one of the only things that actually managed to click with me.\n\nSo if you've heavy into detailed, intricate fantasy worlds with a spirit of adventure, a healthy dose of sci-fi, and covnersations about society and politics, fault is your cake.\n\nIf a stickler like me can love this, then there is no reason you shouldn't.","November 6, 2015","true","8.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Let's start from the beginning. The prologue seems completely disconnected from the main story of this first part, which makes me wonder why they even decided to throw it in. Even thematically the connection is weak. Then we get to start of the story, where the writers decide to begin with the ill-conceived decision of quickly throwing you into a battle scene and filling it with more than half the in-universe jargon terms in the story. You're quickly whisked away somewhere else though and never encounter that location again, or most of the characters in it.\n\nThe main plot of the episode revolves around Rune and the city of Kadia, but unfortunately most of it is told through long passages of past events that almost feel like infodumps, with the present day events affecting little. There is some actual substance behind it and in the relations between the characters involved, but the resolution to the conflict feels extremely shoehorned, with a character having a change of heart that doesn't make sense and contradicts a lot of his past behaviour. Everything is just very miraculously resolved and then you're thrown a very bad sequel hook.\n\nThe art and production values of the VN are good, but lack of utilisation of facial expressions well kind of diminishes this. Whether the fault of the original text or the translation (probably both), the prose also reads awkwardly at quite a number of instances. There are also a few design choices that don't really make much sense--what's the point of that one choice in chapter 3 which barely affects anything, at least Higurashi (Minagoroshi) had a point to make when they did that. The VN also wasted quite a lot of potential on Kadia, where it could have really delved more deeply into the social climate, customs, and expectations of the society, and the interactions between the two companies, but settled for some rather shallow observations here and there. All in all I expected a lot more, but the VN really didn't deliver on any front except art. At least I got it while on the discount, and it does have some very valuable steam cards.\n\nEDIT: Seems it isn't an OELVN (pretty sure I've heard it referred to as such before) but rather just a poorly localised small Japanese VN. Also the game time listed is inaccurate since it includes the time I spent waiting for my trading cards--I took around 3 hours for the story. And the cards aren't really valuable anymore.","December 27, 2015","false","7.9"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Unfortunately the story it settles on likes to lead you by the nose with a drip feed of information and little else to carry your interest. Ultimately it does pay off but not sufficiently so to justify the slow build. Along the way the game finds time to drop out of place sophmoric insights on such topics as religion and gender politics.\n\nWith the main story thread resolved, the game returns to it's initial premise in the closing five minutes to deliver a cliffhanger that will keep few people hanging.

I wanted to get attached to the characters, to know who they were. But instead the game bombards you with exposition about the magic system, with the most convoluted dialog imaginable.\n\nIt didn’t help that the music was very excited about what was going on, like there was supposed to be an action scene there. Instead it was just two people throwing lame one-liners at each other, talking at length about their amazing magic techniques. Apart from the nice artwork it screamed “made by amateurs”. But since I’d bought the damn thing, I was determined to continue. Surely at some point it’d introduce me to the cast and story. And eventually it did!\n\nThe story is intended as the first of a series. But as an opening it’s a bit bewildering the way they’ve done it. The main characters hardly get their due. The focus feels confused. Maybe because the creators wanted to make it episodic, they dove straight into a side story, which feels like it’s stealing time from what’s “really” supposed to be going on. The story has many good moments, but it’s buried under a lot of crap.\n\nI wish they’d done things differently. Like the opening scene introduces a bunch of characters, which are all irrelevant because the story moves somewhere else. They’re obviously coming back later. But what’s the point of giving them 30 minutes of screen time in the opening, when they’re ultimately not part of this story? I also can’t stress enough how awful the exposition is. I just can’t recommend this. It’s not entirely awful. I kinda understand why there’s so many positive reviews of it. You just have to have a very high tolerance to ♥♥♥♥ in order to get to the good parts.

A perspective jumps from person to person sometimes making it hard to know who we are supposed to follow. The situation is especially bad in a part where they supposed to read each others mind but the magic lets them to keep certain thoughts to themselves. Let the chaos begin!\n\nThe dialogs are a bit awkward and the character developments are happening suddenly out of the blue. A certain brother is especially guilty in this last regard.\nThe characters themselves are ok most of the times except they seem to have a habit of acting stupid. (I mostly have issues with a certain father's idea of not letting his son to be lonely. Seriously... wtf?)\nI have to give points to the writing in regard of the two flashbacks though. That two flashback really is well written perhaps because they are told from only one perspective instead of several at the same time making them much easier to follow.\n\nThe graphics and the sounds are mostly ok. However this game really needs a feature that allows me to color the lines of every character differently. Focusing on the story sometimes I didn't notice that a different character started speaking. Especially visible with a certain company's secondary bosses. I don't even know which sprite supposed to belong to which name!\n\nThe game contains only one choice which doesn't absolutely nothing making it totally useless.\n\nHowever, I would still recommend this visual novel it weren't for it's price. it's 15 euros so yeah it's cheaper than most visual novels but:\n1:\nI'm not a fast reader and English is not my first language but I managed to read it in seven hours!

Which is good really but it means that translation costs were covered before the release.

Well there is a multitude of reasons which I am going to list right here.\nYou may already wonder: " How can you judge the game if you only put ~40 minutes into it?"\nWell that is thanks to the fact of the handy skip buttones which might be one of the few good things about the game, alongside the music and the videos, aswell as the prolouge everything else is pretty bad.\nSo what is left to be hated?\nWe got the story\nthe writing\nthe fact that you should not format an actual novel like this\nthe fact that this is hardly a visual but rather a kinetic novel (you get 1 yes a whole lot of one choice during the         game, in chapter 3  (equal to holding down the spacebar for 10~15 minutes depending on your settings for text speed   and transitions)  which affects a whole 4, yes four lines of dialouge or monolouge, not to sure I kinda skipped  on it   because of the writing...)\n\nThe last point is pretty much explained already which leaves just 3 more, so let's start of with the story.\n\nI am just going to start of with an example as to why you might consider the story bad,  The whole thing starts of with anime loli girls slaughtering an entire city, sadly you are not shown the slaughtering only the less compelling ♥♥♥♥♥alking, and after a lot of pointless and boring dialouge you get the first bit on actual conflict between the presumable Protagonist  (only character who ever gets narration from the first person perspective as well as inner monolouges)  and one of the anime loli girls.\nThe protagonist challagens her to a duel, wins and then goes: "I won't kill you, I don't want to shed any blood"\n... Well apparently royal guards could care less about the life of countless guards and citizens as long as the princess is fine, because ♥♥♥♥ moving a finger for peasants...\n\nAnd what follows afterwards seems plain uninspired and average, hell at the end you don't get any real advancement towards anything, you only get sidetracked, read the story of some guys who I did not care about and then get a new companion, only to end with something that might just have been interresting.\n\nYou meet the assassin who killed the king and then the princess goes somewhat batshit and wantsyou to incapitate her to do god knows what with her.\n\nTo sum it up you get a whole lot of nothing for you money with a grand topping of disapointment.\n\nNow on on, it is time to talk about the writing.\n\nWhile this "review" might be phrased quite horribly and lacks any decent formating it should still be levels above what the game gives you, because you get a whole lot of captain obvious and useless information rather than something that makes you want to read it, it became an annoying chore for me 10 minutes in and got followed by a lot of skipping in order to find out whether it might be worth getting through it for something later on.\n\nnot going to happen there is nothing there despite anger, disapointment and a feeling of "♥♥♥♥ I spend money on this ♥♥♥♥"...\n\nIt spells out everything for you, and does this with a whole lot of 1 or 2 lines of dialouge per screen, presumably because that was the only thing they thought you had to do to call it a visual novel, it isn't though...\n\nWhich gets me right to the point of "you should not format an actual novel like this".\nThis "game" is just a novel with horrible formatting which makes it a pain to read it and due to the writing it is not compelling to read, the whole thing that makes something a visual novel, to me at least, is that you can interact with the story in a, at least somewhat meaningful way, and that it actually adapts to your choices, kinda difficult with a whole grand amount of 1 choice though...\n\nIn conclusion there is better free visual novels on steam than this and there are better VN for the same amount of or even less money, so as some kind of reward and at the off chance that you were not aware of the existence of these already I will simply list the ones I can actually recommend and are present on steam.\n\nEverlasting summer (for free)\nFading Hearts\nHatoful Boyfriend\nRising Angels: Reborn (for free)\n\nThanks for bothering to read to this point and please give it alot of thought before you spend money on this game, no matter the discount it got on it, because even for 1$ I could not recommend it to anyone.","December 23, 2014","false","0.7"," 19 of 80 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","19","80","2","6"

"Oh my god."\nfault milestone one : emotional trainwreck. "Not again! For god's sake!"\n\nI intend to read it as a warm up for eden* because its paycheck and I have spare bucks to spend but I get riled up instead.\n\nWell, I won't review about music, graphic, or story because another person already reviewed it and that's pretty much spot on and I satisfied with fault milestone one. I will take different approach, translation.\n\nThis VN translated beautifully. It translated changing Japanese suffix into proper western suffix (e.g: -san, -chan, -kun into Mr. / Ms, -lly, Master) without losing its nuance and feeling. Mind you, I usually REALLY hate when someone did that (changing Japanese suffix into western) because changing suffix will change how I view character's distinctive personality. But this translation surpass my expectation, it's very natural and not forced at all. I can still see how distinctive their personality. Good job for translator who handle this VN.\n\nThey didn't use literal translation for each sentence but 'westernize' it to make it easier to read. Example:\n「　『ルーンの様子がおかしい』　って…　ちゃんと話してくれてたのに…　『仲良くして』　なんて…　」\n(lit translation: "Even though he said 'Rune's behavior is not making any sense' to me... I just said 'Get along with her'")\n\n”He told me what Rune did to that poor cat, he warned me that she was up to no good again... but I didn't want to believe a single word he said."\n\nAs you could see, it sounds pretty differently. But it read a lot of better in SP's translation rather than in literal Japanese translation. So yeah, they did good job and I can enjoy this VN to the fullest. I enjoy Japanese and English equally, both of those satisfied me.\n\nI click 'J' and 'E' button to compare Japanese and English like a madman and I don't regret my brief madness.\n\nPersonal Verdict:  8,3/10 I'll buy fault milestone 2 when it out.","February 4, 2015","true","26.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I didn't really expect much from this VN, but it pleasantly surprised me. I enjoyed it so much that I thought to write a review about it. Plus it's not a high-school-harem-love-fest VN, so that's always nice.\n\nIt opens a bit cliche-esq, with the kingdom under attack and a small force of magical girls (yiss) storming the castle looking to find and kill the princess (of course). There's a small battle sequence that's admitably pretty cool, and then we're warped to an unknown location in the middle of the forest. Blah blah typical fantasy setting with magic and swords and such.\n\nBut as the story progresses, there's a lot more detail added. The town the heroines travel to shares almost no similarities with their kingdom under siege; and while that in it's self isn't anything new, I think it's handled very well in this VN. It doesn't pander to the reader with filler about how lost these two characters are. It jumps right into the depth and storyline of this new society, rather than silly antics that could have been used as a filler.\n\nThe characters are likeable and all offer their own unique take on each situation, even as things seem to progress into the absurd. There were a few moments that didn't seem to make sense based what the reader has experienced in the characters. Like the graveyard scene. Why would Rune act that way towards Ritona?\n\nAll in all, a good VN with a lot of promise.

The royal palace of Rughzenhaide gets attacked by a mysterious group lead by a woman named Melano. In order to save Selphine, Ritona transports her out of the palace but they end up getting lost. Now, they have to find a way to get back to Rughzenhaide. Along the way they meet a girl named Rune and she is what this game is mostly about. There is a second part to this game, so I assume we will find out more about Selphine and what is going on between the Kingdom of Rughzenhaide and the group who attacked it. I really want to know what happens next so I'm glad the second part got licensed.\n\nThe story did keep me engaged and I wanted to know what was going to happen next. I also liked most of the characters.\n\nThe character sprites and the CGs are well drawn. No complaints there. The music is also pretty good especially for the intense moments. I'm glad it wasn't thirty second samples that repeat over and over again like in other visual novels made by small groups.\n\nI liked the mix of fantasy and science fiction in the overall world. The game can get caught up in technical jargon at times interrupting the flow of the narrative. All of a sudden the characters start explaining what something does and the story flow just stops. It's no big deal but it was noticeable. The game does have a dictionary explaining terms that come up and a pronunciation guide, which was helpful cause I had no idea how to properly pronounce the names of places.\n\nThis is a fairly short visual novel compared to others I've played. It took me about five hours to read (I didn't skip the demo parts either). It is part of a multi-part series so it's not much of a negative. The font could have been better but it didn't bother me much. I did notice that they fixed the speed of the words in the intro. I remember that they used to be much faster in the demo. I consider myself a fast reader and even I couldn't keep up with the words in the demo. So that's good that they fixed that. As for choices, there is only one choice in the whole game. It doesn't seem to make a difference though. I may be wrong since I haven't played it again all the way through with the other choice. I\n\nAlso, there is no yuri. Most of the characters are women but I saw no yuri at all. If you are looking for yuri romance, there isn't any.\n\nIf you like visual novels, buy this game. It seems like there is more to come. I can't wait till the second part comes out. If you don't like spending lots of time reading then this game's length is good.\n\nRecommended.","January 5, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The characters are interesting enough, and they are not that stereotypical. The flow of the narration is also good, save a few segments in which it gets a little too caught in its own jargon (but luckily the encyclopedia built in helps for this). The only fault I can find is that a certain event happens right at the end out of the blue, mostly for cliffhanger purposes, but I would have liked some sort of mild foreshadowing.\n\nTechnically speaking, the game is competent: being a doujin game people can't expect a lot of backgrounds or characters, but the character design is nice and the CGs are well done. The music, though a bit repetitive sometimes, complements the scenes well. The game is unvoiced, but that is not a problem at all.\n\nThe localization, from the looks of it, is generally solid. In short, a recommended title, even though perhaps the regular price is a bit high considering the length (around six hours) and no replay value unlike other Visual Novels.","January 6, 2015","true","4.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whereas most visual novels offered to the West either lean heavily on violence, romance, or sex as their major narrative and entertaining force, fault milestone manages to distance itself from those into a more distinctive meld of fantasy and human, interpersonal drama. Some combat does indeed happen, but it is sudden and short, if nonetheless intent on explaining the nitty gritty details in the short time it happens.\n\nDon't expect the most groundbreaking plot threads and themes, but fault milestone one offers a competent and heartening drama and sets it in a world built that could easily have encompassed a lengthier RPG game. For a VN that features all heroines, it also treats them with a lot of respect in this first part, which is commendable. At one point, the heroines even discuss with disdain "androcentrism".\n\nOther notes:\nFeatures only ONE choice that does not seem to significantly alter the story, so for all intents and purposes it is a linear visual novel.\nThe artwork for the heroines and some of the villainesses are all quite good, but the quality isn't as consistent when it comes to the side-characters.\nThe script has a couple of nods to pop culture memes that feel pretty out of place, particularly the last one which may hurt the drama of the scene for you.\nCapes look ♥♥♥♥ing cool.","February 17, 2015","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, the VN suffers from a lack of distinction when presenting characters thoughs which can be especially confusing when switching between characters rapidly within a scene.

Been a while since something I've bought on Steam has utterly blown my expectations out of the water the way this amazing little number did.\n\nLet's start with the easy tangibles. fault is a kinetic, multi-part visual novel (VN for short) translated and localised by Sekai Project. For those unfamiliar with the terms, a VN is kind of like a computerized comic book or graphic novel. You have backgrounds for different locations in the story, varied character art to express different emotions, and a couple other differences (such as the ability to save), but by and large they're simply a way to tell a mostly non-interactive story via a computer. Some VNs allow the player to make choices that affect the game's ending, but a kinetic VN such as fault only has one ending that the player can't affect. This isn't a good or bad thing in and of itself, but some people will prefer being able to make choices, while others will prefer to sit back and let the story guide itself.\n\nI'd like to talk about the artwork next. As several other glowing reviews testify - not to mention the actual screenshots from the store page itself - the art is pretty amazing, both the background and character art. I'll admit I've got a bit of a skewed perspective here; most of my VN experience comes from older VNs, and obviously artwork from newer entries in the genre will be a step up. Still, I think it's safe to say with how many other people have consistently lauded the artwork, it's safe to say that, even compared to its contemporaries, fault's artwork is in a class of its own.\n\nNow, the soundtrack. I think it served its purpose quite well - no tracks grated on my ears; on the contrary, it was quite nice. There wasn't any instantly memorable track that jumps out at you like Fate/Stay Night's EMIYA or Clannad's The Place Where Wishes Come True, but that's easily forgiven. I did notice a problem that I also noted in my review of WORLD END ECONOMiCA: Some songs have a somewhat painfully-noticeable loop point. It wasn't as particularly egregrious as with ECONOMiCA's abrupt stops and starts - the songs here have smooth fades - but I feel a couple emotional moments were hurt because of a song that was too short to naturally cover the scene. While I'm on the topic of sound, I should note that this VN contains no voice acting. That's a showstopper for some people, but at the same time, voice acting in VNs is a relative luxury; you're missing out if you're only reading voiced VNs.\n\nAnd speaking of emotional moments, the writing. Oh, the writing.\n\nDon't be put off by the screenshots or by the admittedly somewhat slow start. There's a fair amount of topics that the game touches pretty eloquently upon, such as cultural divides and how those standing across such boundaries are perceived, the inner machinations of (vague spoilers) a sociopath and how they come across and are dealt with by those around them, and even (vague, but major thematic spoilers for late in the game) a Ghost in the Shell-esque discussion on what defines humanity, and what defines a particular person as that person, which caught me completely off guard. You might also want to keep the Kleenex handy; this game has instances where it rivals the tearjerker moments of Jun Maeda's best works. And if you read my review on planetarian, you'd know exactly how much that statement means.\n\nI will say, as the previous paragraph mentioned, that the VN has a slow start, and takes an hour or so's worth of reading to really hit its stride. And, well, it's short. 5 hours - how long it took me to read through the entire work - is pretty short, especially for a VN that has only one ending. That said, this is a multi-part work, and as I write this, the 2nd installment is already available to purchase on Steam. Yes, you do have to buy them separately.\n\nAll things considered, fault: milestone one is one of the best VNs currently available on Steam. I highly recommend checking it out, even if you've never read one before.","November 6, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prepare to settle in, there's a good few hours of click-and-reading to be had. While I believe Fault is well worth the time, it is not without its stumbles. I have attempted to summarize the aspects I took issue with below, but if you are looking for a mix of fantasy and science fiction, read my review no further, and instead raed the VN!\n\nArt\nPretty good. In the style of manga, with a nice color balance. Less animated than I'd like, but more than is stricktly neccessary. Fault is much more novel than visual.\n\nSountrack\nReally quite good! I am always surprised and delighted by a good soundtrack, and fault made good stylistic choices. The music adds a lot of emotion and energy to its scenes.\n\nWorld Building\nThe world of fault is quite complicated. The game engine provides a helpful encyclopedia of terms, depending on the reader's memory it may or may not be neccessary to keep track of the many items and concepts introduced. As of reading this first episode, the narrative jouney though the various countries, continents, and cast has almost raised more questions than it has answered. The world-building is good, and leaves me hanging, waiting for more.\n\nCast of Characters\nPerhaps it is difficult to be novel, when writing in the niche VNs occupy. The cast of fault are mostly familiar archetypes, given depth of character by long, expository backstory. Oddly enough, the protanists themselves may be the characters with the least explicitly given history! While not exactly new, they do not feel like tired tropes.\n\nStoryline\nThe story of fault is as complicated as the world, if not more so. ...And, I expect, only going to become more complicated with future installments. Spoiling as little as I can, I will say that the complexity is mainly by virtue of its episodic design; the majority of this story appears to be a "sidequest" for the protagonists. Whether the many characters introduced will be reused, I cannot say.\n\nScience/Magitech\nFault describes a rules-based magic system based on "mana," although what exactly mana is has been largely hand-waved away. Despite the implication of rules, little is explained about the function of this mana, and highly complicated machines are hand-waved away as "maga engines." This magic is both combined and shown in contrast with technology, but the line is not defined. Frankly, the mix feels sloppy, but this may be only due to my desire to see the inner workings explored in depth.\n\nGame engine\nLooks good, functions, a little annoying that scrolling causes text to advnace forwards.\nSeems to be renpy, but performs very well! Less CPU usage than Steam itself :)\n\nBottom Line\nFault is a good read. It's not very long, and while most of the game engine's features are not required, they look great, and are made good use of.\nI recommend it.","June 14, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you’re not a crying mess at the end, you literally have no soul.\n\nI’ll give you the categories at the start and elaborate in the second part.\n\nWriting:\nWhile it’s coherent and engaging, they didn’t always manage to create great suspense during supposedly tense dialogues. But they managed to invoke all other feelings of the spectrum exceptionally well, so it’s quite all right.\n\nCharacters:\nThey seem well balanced and the protagonists are super likable. To avoid spoilers I'll just say that almost all the introduced main characters have very unique and mostly original backstories and personalities. The way the writers handle antagonism in this part is a little unconventional and really well executed. (I won’t go into detail as that would be a massive spoiler)\n\nSetting:\nIt starts out feeling like a relatively standard magic/fantasy world, but several nuances and problems get introduced over time for the world to feel very unique.\n\nPacing:\nOne of the things they did really well was the pacing of serious and light-hearted scenes. They play into each other beautifully and the contrast between them never makes you numb for the feelings of joy, tension or sadness of either type of scene.\n\nLength:\nI’m a relatively fast reader (English isn’t my mother tongue though, so I think I’m pretty slow compared to fast English readers) and I finished the whole thing in rouhly 5.5 hours. I’d guess depending on your reading speed and how much you want to think about what you’re reading, it’ll take you 3 to 10 hours to power through the whole thing.\n\nArtwork:\nIt‘s not extraordinarily awesome, but pretty enough and enjoyable to look at.\n\nMusic:\nSome of the pieces overstay their welcome for the situation or could at least use a little volume reduction during the lows in the suspense curve of each scene. Apart from that the music is quite beautiful and fitting.\n\nGameplay:\nThere is none. You have one dialogue choice during the entire game and it isn’t exactly impactful, yet. Apart from that, it’s just reading.\n\n\n\nConclusion:\nTo put it in a nutshell, Fault Milestone One is a highly emotionally impactful visual novel set in an interesting fantasy/industrial world with very likable and complex characters. To put the cherry on top, the game made no mistakes (in my opinion) and thus creates a very fluid and enjoyable story that never takes you out of the experience.\n\n\n\nNow for the more in-depth stuff; beware of spoilers, though, there will definitely be some.\n\n### SPOILERS AHEAD ###\n\nA large part of the lore’s exposition was done somewhat lazyly and is basically just one of the characters talking about their past. It takes a pretty damn long time to read through as well, if you compare it to the whole thing. At the same time, they managed to make the narration seem distant enough so you aren’t reminded that it’s basically just someone telling a story and it feels more like you’re retrospectively watching the plot unfold as it happens.\n\nThe game also deals with some heavy philosophical topics like what it means to be human, how emotions guide our actions and how important they really are. Milestone One doesn’t really go super in-depth with it (which would have felt weird and out-of-place anyway), but it is expertly interwoven with the story and really makes you think.\n\nSpeaking of emotions, the game is a real tear-jerker. I was sobbing uncontrollably at the end for a straight 5 minutes. If you want context about me, the only stories that managed that so far are Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Blue, the third Hunger Games book, Clannad, and now Fault Milestone One.","April 26, 2015","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/equinoxmg/recommended/286260/","equinoxmg","Masonasaur","http://steamcommunity.com/id/equinoxmg/","137 products in account","I was actually expecting something longer than that, but I can't say I'm totally dissatisfied.\nA word of advice: 'fault milestone one' is not just a fancy title for the first full VN in a series from the same universe, it's more of a part one for the "fault" storyline...literally the first milestone in Selphine and Ritona's journey. The entire VN after the calamitous opening scene takes place in Kadia surrounding a character who introduces herself to you as Rune, so if you are reading this before deciding to purchase this VN, keep that in mind.\n\nI approached the entire experience (up until the ending smacked me abruptly in the face) as a long-winded segment within a much larger and potentially more interesting story, which left me fairly bored at several times as I did not invest myself very deeply in what was happening and merely wanted to move on after 10 hours, but which actually ended up taking something closer to 15 hours in total. So, it's hard to say how I would have felt if I had known better what to expect from start to finish, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that I would have enjoyed it much more than I did, which I did very much enjoy it to be fair.\nWith that said, it definitely felt like some things were repeated at various points during the story, literally being hammered into the mind of the reader so that no matter how uninvested you may be, you won't miss any details I can assure you. For some people, that may be a good thing and I definitely recognize this fault in storytelling as being a pet peeve of mine, so other people may not see it as nearly as serious of an offense as myself, but I'm confident in suggesting that this VN could have concluded in a significantly shorter span of time.\n~*~SPOILER~*~\nAlso, there was that one graveyard scene that never made any sense to me. I understood that importance of what Sara said to Ritona, but was the eeriness surrounding that moment ever made sense of, or was it just some artistic license taken to give the scene more impact so as to cement the information in the reader's mind? It just seemed very contradictory to what the writer was trying to convince the reader of about Sara being the new, better v2.0 Rune with new emotional karate chop action, and Ritona never mentions the incident again. I feel like it was just a gimmick and any important it may have once had in earlier drafts of the plot were scrapped without also removing the scene itself.\nThere was only one player choice, and I'll gladly admit I had only followed through with one option, but I have a distinct feeling that it won't matter very much given the way the story is split up between separate VNs. I can imagine that the choice will either lead to a dead end, or will be overwritten by the NPCs in the story, forcing the player to return to the selection in order to choose the right path anyway. I'll have to verify this.\n\nAll-in-all I'd give it an 8/10 regardless of what the play choice holds I don't think it will sway my opinion one way or another. There is no voice acting, but the characters are all beautifully unique and don't stand out as being cliché. The writing itself is good (and especially the translation), but the scripting leaves something to be desired. As I mentioned before, some parts and information were repeated, unnecessarily long, or entirely pointless, which is forgivable in moderation, but you may find yourself being told the same thing again or reminded of the same details and suddenly feel yourself pulled out of the story as you think to yourself "Yup, heard this already...moving on..."\n\nI would definitely recommend this, even if it's only for the lovable cast of characters. Definite waifu material within this VN. For $15, you're arguably getting your money's worth unless you just really don't like reading, or at least can't stand reading a VN without some kind of voice, be it native or foreign (Japanese in this case).","September 15, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Prepare to settle in, there's a good few hours of click-and-reading to be had. While I believe Fault is well worth the time, it is not without its stumbles. I have attempted to summarize the aspects I took issue with below, but if you are looking for a mix of fantasy and science fiction, read my review no further, and instead raed the VN!\n\nArt\nPretty good. In the style of manga, with a nice color balance. Less animated than I'd like, but more than is stricktly neccessary. Fault is much more novel than visual.\n\nSountrack\nReally quite good! I am always surprised and delighted by a good soundtrack, and fault made good stylistic choices. The music adds a lot of emotion and energy to its scenes.\n\nWorld Building\nThe world of fault is quite complicated. The game engine provides a helpful encyclopedia of terms, depending on the reader's memory it may or may not be neccessary to keep track of the many items and concepts introduced. As of reading this first episode, the narrative jouney though the various countries, continents, and cast has almost raised more questions than it has answered. The world-building is good, and leaves me hanging, waiting for more.\n\nCast of Characters\nPerhaps it is difficult to be novel, when writing in the niche VNs occupy. The cast of fault are mostly familiar archetypes, given depth of character by long, expository backstory. Oddly enough, the protanists themselves may be the characters with the least explicitly given history! While not exactly new, they do not feel like tired tropes.\n\nStoryline\nThe story of fault is as complicated as the world, if not more so. ...And, I expect, only going to become more complicated with future installments. Spoiling as little as I can, I will say that the complexity is mainly by virtue of its episodic design; the majority of this story appears to be a "sidequest" for the protagonists. Whether the many characters introduced will be reused, I cannot say.\n\nScience/Magitech\nFault describes a rules-based magic system based on "mana," although what exactly mana is has been largely hand-waved away. Despite the implication of rules, little is explained about the function of this mana, and highly complicated machines are hand-waved away as "maga engines." This magic is both combined and shown in contrast with technology, but the line is not defined.

Less CPU usage than Steam itself :)\n\nBottom Line\nFault is a good read. It's not very long, and while most of the game engine's features are not required, they look great, and are made good use of.\nI recommend it.","June 14, 2015","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The demo is great. I have to write a little weird review for this VN. Here's why I absolutely loved it.\n\nHave you played Undertale? Don't worry, I won't spoil anything. (Even the stuff in spoiler tags is arguable whether they're spoilers.)\n\n(In fact, if you're still worried about it, just get the demo for this VN already and play it. This entire review isn't really necessary if you just check out the demo.)\n\nI want to note just one thing: the description of Undertale. "A game where no one has to die". Except, unsurprisingly, there are just a few characters where this seems to be impossible. Well, afterall, death is a part of life. You can't save an old man from his age, for example. It's poignant because no matter what you do, how hard you try, it's just not part of the game, so whacha gonna do, right? Among such characters, there's one character I've been obsessing over. One I've really felt for and connected with, yet nobody else seems to care about. Maybe it's because, rare enough for most, I've experienced depression, strong enough to feel that level of hatred, that some people may not empathize with.\n\nThis game saves that character. I felt like this game saved me.\n\nAs the top review states. This is a peaceful magical country attacked by rebels or something. The princess and her friend/bodyguard escape by teleporting away. Instead of their intended location, they fall into a place with no magic, just technology. When they're completely lost there, they find an awkward, but friendly girl who wants to help them. Rune... (Oh, and if you didn't yet, maybe watch that trailer video up there.)\n\nIf you're still unsure... Get the demo! Please.","October 12, 2015","true","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Before they can really start their journey back to the kingdom of Rugzhenhaide, they meeta girl named Rune, whose shrouded past attracts their concern.\n\nfault milestone one is the first chapter in what is expected to be a long running series of science-fantasy kinetic (linear, non-branching story) visual novels that details Ritona and Selphine's journey back to Rugzhenhaide. Story-wise, most of the visual novel is comprised of flashbacks after the first couple chapters which also gives it the feel of a mystery story. While it is the first installment in a series, the main story for fault milestone one self contained as the overarching plot for the series takes a back seat once Rune gets introduced.\n\nThe visual novel's UI is pretty basic for a visual novel, although it's pretty dolled up so it doesn't look like a generic visual novel UI. Regarding extras, fault milestone one has galleries for music, the CG images used throughout the story. There is also an encyclopedia which gives further details for many of the terminology, mainly ones regarding mana and manakravte, this world's semi-equivalent to magic, used in the story. However, there are no character bios.\n\nClocking in at around 5 or 6 hours, fault milestone may seem a bit expensive at $15, but the gripping, emotionally charged story is well worth the full price.","September 28, 2015","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The entire VN after the calamitous opening scene takes place in Kadia surrounding a character who introduces herself to you as Rune, so if you are reading this before deciding to purchase this VN, keep that in mind.\n\nI approached the entire experience (up until the ending smacked me abruptly in the face) as a long-winded segment within a much larger and potentially more interesting story, which left me fairly bored at several times as I did not invest myself very deeply in what was happening and merely wanted to move on after 10 hours, but which actually ended up taking something closer to 15 hours in total. So, it's hard to say how I would have felt if I had known better what to expect from start to finish, but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and assume that I would have enjoyed it much more than I did, which I did very much enjoy it to be fair.\nWith that said, it definitely felt like some things were repeated at various points during the story, literally being hammered into the mind of the reader so that no matter how uninvested you may be, you won't miss any details I can assure you. For some people, that may be a good thing and I definitely recognize this fault in storytelling as being a pet peeve of mine, so other people may not see it as nearly as serious of an offense as myself, but I'm confident in suggesting that this VN could have concluded in a significantly shorter span of time.\n~*~SPOILER~*~\nAlso, there was that one graveyard scene that never made any sense to me. I understood that importance of what Sara said to Ritona, but was the eeriness surrounding that moment ever made sense of, or was it just some artistic license taken to give the scene more impact so as to cement the information in the reader's mind? It just seemed very contradictory to what the writer was trying to convince the reader of about Sara being the new, better v2.0 Rune with new emotional karate chop action, and Ritona never mentions the incident again. I feel like it was just a gimmick and any important it may have once had in earlier drafts of the plot were scrapped without also removing the scene itself.\nThere was only one player choice, and I'll gladly admit I had only followed through with one option, but I have a distinct feeling that it won't matter very much given the way the story is split up between separate VNs. I can imagine that the choice will either lead to a dead end, or will be overwritten by the NPCs in the story, forcing the player to return to the selection in order to choose the right path anyway. I'll have to verify this.\n\nAll-in-all I'd give it an 8/10 regardless of what the play choice holds I don't think it will sway my opinion one way or another. There is no voice acting, but the characters are all beautifully unique and don't stand out as being cliché. The writing itself is good (and especially the translation), but the scripting leaves something to be desired. As I mentioned before, some parts and information were repeated, unnecessarily long, or entirely pointless, which is forgivable in moderation, but you may find yourself being told the same thing again or reminded of the same details and suddenly feel yourself pulled out of the story as you think to yourself "Yup, heard this already...moving on..."\n\nI would definitely recommend this, even if it's only for the lovable cast of characters. Definite waifu material within this VN. For $15, you're arguably getting your money's worth unless you just really don't like reading, or at least can't stand reading a VN without some kind of voice, be it native or foreign (Japanese in this case).","September 15, 2015","true","18.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Been a while since something I've bought on Steam has utterly blown my expectations out of the water the way this amazing little number did.\n\nLet's start with the easy tangibles. fault is a kinetic, multi-part visual novel (VN for short) translated and localised by Sekai Project. For those unfamiliar with the terms, a VN is kind of like a computerized comic book or graphic novel. You have backgrounds for different locations in the story, varied character art to express different emotions, and a couple other differences (such as the ability to save), but by and large they're simply a way to tell a mostly non-interactive story via a computer. Some VNs allow the player to make choices that affect the game's ending, but a kinetic VN such as fault only has one ending that the player can't affect. This isn't a good or bad thing in and of itself, but some people will prefer being able to make choices, while others will prefer to sit back and let the story guide itself.\n\nI'd like to talk about the artwork next. As several other glowing reviews testify - not to mention the actual screenshots from the store page itself - the art is pretty amazing, both the background and character art. I'll admit I've got a bit of a skewed perspective here; most of my VN experience comes from older VNs, and obviously artwork from newer entries in the genre will be a step up. Still, I think it's safe to say with how many other people have consistently lauded the artwork, it's safe to say that, even compared to its contemporaries, fault's artwork is in a class of its own.\n\nNow, the soundtrack. I think it served its purpose quite well - no tracks grated on my ears; on the contrary, it was quite nice. There wasn't any instantly memorable track that jumps out at you like Fate/Stay Night's EMIYA or Clannad's The Place Where Wishes Come True, but that's easily forgiven. I did notice a problem that I also noted in my review of WORLD END ECONOMiCA: Some songs have a somewhat painfully-noticeable loop point. It wasn't as particularly egregrious as with ECONOMiCA's abrupt stops and starts - the songs here have smooth fades - but I feel a couple emotional moments were hurt because of a song that was too short to naturally cover the scene. While I'm on the topic of sound, I should note that this VN contains no voice acting. That's a showstopper for some people, but at the same time, voice acting in VNs is a relative luxury; you're missing out if you're only reading voiced VNs.\n\nAnd speaking of emotional moments, the writing. Oh, the writing.\n\nDon't be put off by the screenshots or by the admittedly somewhat slow start. There's a fair amount of topics that the game touches pretty eloquently upon, such as cultural divides and how those standing across such boundaries are perceived, the inner machinations of (vague spoilers) a sociopath and how they come across and are dealt with by those around them, and even (vague, but major thematic spoilers for late in the game) a Ghost in the Shell-esque discussion on what defines humanity, and what defines a particular person as that person, which caught me completely off guard. You might also want to keep the Kleenex handy; this game has instances where it rivals the tearjerker moments of Jun Maeda's best works. And if you read my review on planetarian, you'd know exactly how much that statement means.\n\nI will say, as the previous paragraph mentioned, that the VN has a slow start, and takes an hour or so's worth of reading to really hit its stride. And, well, it's short. 5 hours - how long it took me to read through the entire work - is pretty short, especially for a VN that has only one ending. That said, this is a multi-part work, and as I write this, the 2nd installment is already available to purchase on Steam. Yes, you do have to buy them separately.\n\nAll things considered, fault: milestone one is one of the best VNs currently available on Steam. I highly recommend checking it out, even if you've never read one before.","November 6, 2015","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each and everyone has their own ups and downs also you will get attached to the main characters, in which you will care about them and worry as what might happen as the story progress.\n\nSummary : This is a great Visual novel but its only 1 part of the whole story, which means you won't get the full story and the game it self is quite short ( 6-9 hours depends on how fast you read ).\nThere is a second part and soon will come more 2 parts of the story in the near future.\nBut while the main plot isn't finished there is a "side plot" in which the game mostly will concetrate on, and it is there you will be satisfied by the ending of that plot ( in this case its about that mysterious girl "Sora" ). In fact it made me shed a tear T_T from the amout of "feels" and "emotions". I have no doubt that those who enjoy reading and Visual novels will as well enjoy this one, It is clearly worth to buy","December 18, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's so much detail on specific points that most people could get lost; I read through it again when I got fault milestone 2 just to keep a clean, straight story. Reading it twice does fortify information though, first time through I understood the abstract concept and emotional value, and the second time through I really did feel like the world opened up to me.

The story is brilliant. Especially for an original piece of work some might even call it spectacular, but I struggle to use that word seriously. The story is about a princess and her guardian as they have fled their home and war using a temperamental magic. Using this magic they find themselves not where they expected and in completely unfamiliar territory. Before they get home they need answers as to where they are and how to get home but as they dig for the answers, they dig a bit deep into a mystery of the town and find themselves in serious danger. Before they leave, they need to solve problems that threaten who they find themselves caring about all while in serious danger themselves.\n\nThe characters are nicely fleshed out, and each have a non-stereotpical personality however, you may be able to pick out the inspiriations for these characters which may take away from the experience for you. I instantly recognized the story of one character in particular but it didn't stop me from liking them.\n\nThe artwork in this game is pretty damn good and it isn't all about dem girls even if pretty much all of the cast are female. Combined with the good soundtrack there is a pretty nice atmospheric feel to it.\n\nAll in all, this visual novel is a fantastic start to the fault series and a great entry into visual novels in general if this would be your first one.","March 6","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To help you to enjoy this experience, consider going to a play-that is largely based on the exposition and dialogue rather than action scenes or animation. So rather than playing a game, you're having a novel acted out in front of you. And it's great.\n\nJust remember that when you go in. If you go in thinking this game is going to be user-intensive, you'll feel left out. Sit back, and read it like a book, just with a lot more visual and auditory investment due to pictures and sound.\n\nAlso, this is the first of a series, and this series relies a. on an episodic story, b. on a lot of exposition, and c. on you enjoying the technical aspects of learning about worlds and world building. While it can get a little heavy for some, I found it perfectly handled especially with the introduction of a character who wouldn't know anything, thus managing to hold onto the story well.\n\nI really enjoyed this series, and found it really well done. The characters were memorable and multi-faceted, or set up in such a way as to become more memorable in the future, with regards to the sequel. Interesting world that keeps you engaged through exposition, a neat twist on magic that is used to comment on society, and overall a great game that involves lots of thinking and commentary on real world events.\n\nAlso, the main and side story are handled really well as it reminds you of the main story but also builds upon it's characters with both the side and main stories, providing a nice garnish for your entree, to use a gustatory metaphor.\n\nOverall, I would give it a ten out of ten, and cite the only complaints as this series not really being to someone's tastes, but it's well done to those who would enjoy it. Most of the negative reviews are complaints about the game's designs-and this design is one whom you have to figure it out whether you would enjoy it yourself or not.\n\nI would say it's definitely worth a whirl, at least.\n\nPlus, the art is absolutely gorgeous, and the soundtrack is simply divine.","June 16, 2015","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art, music and story evokes memories of DS can can fully stand on its own in its sci-fi storytelling with interesting concepts such as the complex role of mana in the world; the characters are written with purpose, each with a compelling motivation for their presence; and the music is emotional and appropriate to the situation at hand.\n\nThis is a pure kinetic novel - there is virtually no gameplay (with the exception of one decision which I don't think changes the outcome of the story in any way), much akin to Juniper's Knot.\n\nMy only gripe is the first chapter can feel grueling to read through - the villians presented in the first chapter feels overly cliched and their personalities were beyond too bubbly for the eventual serious tones the VN was to dive into.

This was my same question some time ago when I downloaded the demo of this game. Spoiler: the answer is yes.\n\nWell, a lot of time passed before I decided to buy the game. At first, I though "well, I appreciate what I've seen so far but I'm not gonna buy it. I won't appreciate it as a novel I do nothing to shape in anyway. I want real routes, at least!". Then I eventually bought fault milestone one on sale, loved it, and then bought and devoured fault milestone two as well.\n\nI used to think I could never appreciate VN. I just wasn't into the genre, maybe. But I really love the work put in by the developers, as it really can be graphically and plot-wise awesome and personally meaningful at the same time. The story is awesome and convincing, there is no flat character, not even the "bad" guys or not even the secondary ones. And, jeez, you don't shape the story, but the story does shape you.\n\ntl;dr: Feels, good waifus, beautiful story-line, amazing plot-twists and top-notch fighting girls.

Now, they must find a way to get themselves back home. Not just that, the story explores other themes such as redemption, technology, wealth over morals, and even a tough situation where, If you have a loved one who isn't "right", would you still love them? I know that's been shown countless times in fiction and TV, but if you enjoy these kinds of questions, this one delves into these types of scenarios.\n\nIt's an adventure type story, from the overly friendly stranger, the suspicious, curt local, that one person who seems to know everything, a secret, and the motions of trying to learn the land that they are in, Fault has it all and while it doesn't really do anything new to the genre, I think Alice in Dissonance weaves all of these elements very well. The characters are fairly likable, with Selphine's naive but kind persona sometimes being at odds with Ritona's more serious and practical nature, creates interesting moments and character development. While the story at first has a grim atmoshphere, it also has a fair amount of moments of joviality and overall fun to it. The VN's balances is pretty well but does get heavy handed with the feels, and angst later on.\n\nOne other thing, some of the dialogue is stiff and unnatural. I with I can pull a line for the review but lets just say that some of the lines here are overly formal and aren't things that normal people would say or talk like. The only way I can describe it is "anime speak". If you've watched anime, you know what I'm talking about.\n\nThe artwook is good. Nothing too great, but not bad either. Definitely one of the better looking ones! Some of the side characters look bad though, and head proportions seem off, particularly for Selphine IMO in certain sprites. Music is excellent! Fault's theme is simple, repetive, and hypnotic and has joined my Top 5 favorite of VG themes. Each track sets the mood well. Fault also has got to have some of the most realistic and grounded magical lore I've ever read. Now granted, I don't read a lot of fantasy novels; perhaps RR Martin's work or some other fantasy writer has a very in-depth mythos of their fiction's magic, but this one takes the cake. AiD did a good job of trying to explain how "manakravte"- the game's label for magic"- works, but they also weave those around the story in a seamless manner. It takes time to try to sort everything out but if you think about it a little, it will come together.\n\nOne majore flaw I find about this though is that there's a certain character whose story arc that seems to overpower the overall narrative. There's a story within a story, but it's a pretty long one! I'd say a 1/3 or 1/4 is devoted to the arc and while it does make me like this certain character, I feel like it almost hijacks the original story. I know Fault isn't just about Selphine and Ritona trying to get back home, the series wants to show a part of humanity. How we work, how we think, and that despite our differences, there are fundamental things that we all share and want but by the time the arc is resolved, I thought to myself, "Whoa! I almost forgot this was about Selphine!"\n\nOverall, I'd rate it 8/10. Some pacing issues later on in the end, predictable twists, and frustrating, "Just TALK it out!" moments mar the experience, Fault is a VN that shouldn't be overlooked, especially with its pleasant cast of characters, great music, and lively presentation.","May 8","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At some point in the early stages of the game you get the feeling which good old-school RPGs gave you - that you can't go on playing, because your head is stuffed with new information. It really feels as if some grand old-school RPG was pressed into the format of a visual novel.\n\nThe writing is good and keeps you hooked from the beginning to the end, the graphics are nice, and the music in the background is very emotional and ideally matches the situation. The production value is very high, the game looks well-budgeted.\n\nThe only negative moment, at least for me, is the fact that closer to the end the plot goes into the topics that were so many times chewed before in literature, cinematograph and pop-culture, that it can make you grimace seeing the story going down to this.\n\nBut of course I would recommend this game, because it offers far more than you would expect from a visual novel. Just be sure to try the demo, it contains the first (and, in my opinion, the best) half of the episode.","May 6","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story starts with an incident mentioning an invasion of the Kingdom Rughzenhaide which forced both protagonists to leave their own kingdom.\nHowever, after they used their special vectakravte ''Riptide Effect'' to escape, they failed to control the spell and were teleported, instead of the expected destination, to the border of a city known as Kadia, in the Outer-Pole, which is at the other side of the planet for them in comparison to the distance between their kingdom that is in the Inner-Pole. Soon after this, they encountered Rune, and here, the prologue ends......\n\nThis is not a total Science Fiction, nor a replete Fantasy. It is rather settled as a human drama influenced by the 2 genres above, with a length of 4-8 hours in a read-through.\n\nIn this VN, we have pretty, dynamic, strong and shocking melodies inside the soundtracks which really played a good role as a support to the story, I have to say that the creators did put a lot of effort into making this visual novel on its story, design of graphics and composition of soundtracks,. Therefore, I would like to say that it is a good example to other VNs.\n\nPositive remarks\n+Beautiful and touching story.\n+Well-designed graphics\n+huge varieties of genres of soundtracks in order to support any circumstances of the story effectively\n\nNegative remarks\n- a little translation mistakes\n\n(P.S : I don’t know why my timing record is 114 hours)","November 4, 2015","true","114.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
