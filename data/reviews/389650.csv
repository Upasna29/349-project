It didn't detect the max refresh rate or resolution, so I relaunched the game and all was well. I did have to set it up to the maximum resolution though.\n\nOn to the game itself. This appears to be a co-op bullet hell that you can customize the experience of. The graphics are crisp, the music is catchy, and it looks to support both K&M and Xbox style controllers (based on the graphics shown, though I admit I don't have a Dualshock 4 to test with).\n\nOn my system, (2600K @ 4.3Ghz, 16GB DDR3 1600 CL9, and a GTX 980) it runs beautifully at 2560x1440, I can't detect any framerate drops, but I'm also using a G-Sync monitor.\n\nCharacter selection is small, but the items within them are significant, I look forward to pressing on and figuring out what my favorite options are.\n\nBack to the Galaxy I go now!","April 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/recommended/389650/","Dragnix","{FITH}™Dragnix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dragnix/","743 products in account","This key was obtained from the developer for the purposes of review\n\nSummary:\nSolid across the board is the name of the game with Stardust Galaxy Warriors. It's not a game that takes it self too seriously, as you fight everything from a giant talking asteroid to a giant disco ball. What stands out here is the customization and options that are available. Your weapon load outs will play to specific play styles that will do well in parts of levels but not in others, and it helps that the local co-op can play to the game's strengths in question. The customization of fire rates, enemy durability and power ups help to create an experience that can work for any player in the end, giving challenge for those SHMUP pros while scaling back the experience for those who need a little help. Also: props to the fantastic soundtrack here: it's the highlight of the game and frankly makes me recommend the soundtrack as a purchase in of itself, even if you don't like SHMUPs. Does the game's combat over time drag a tiny bit? Yes it does, but in the end, for a 10 dollar title, you can't get much better then the bang for buck that this game provides.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_rkwYRPnZg\n\nLists:\n+:\nCustomization options for gameplay is one of the strongest in the genre this year, or of many SHMUP like games I've played. Customization of fire rates, enemy durability, and what power ups do makes a game that can tailor itself to you specifically, if you put the time into it. While it can screw with the balance, the default selections do a good job to balance, and it's your decision in the end.\nFantastic Soundtrack. Well worth a look by itself.\nWeapon and Mech selections make a huge difference, as you can really change up your playstyle based on what your selection is. Coop choices makes a difference.\nSome backgrounds are fantastic (the water level in particular). The graphics options are great for a game of this cost, and while it doesn't take every opportunity for the visual style to come through, it's pretty fantastic.\nThe controls are solid.\nThe 4th wall breaking humor does the job. It's a cheesy storyline, but hey, did you expect otherwise?\n-:\nThe Gauntlet mode could use a little bit more punch in the end. It feels very similar after a couple of plays. Over time, the game does have slight trouble in variety.\nBoss patterns needs a little bit more as they repeat too often.\nIt's hard to see the detail on the Mechs that they put on them\nLike other games in the genre, sometimes there's too much on the screen, and the explosions and bullets can get lost in the visuals.","November 10, 2015","true","6.3"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","28","36","0","0"

Feel free to keep reading if you want to know my reason.\n\nI'm not a hardcore fan of shoot-em-ups, I didn't even know what the word "shump" meant until today, but what I do know is that this game is really fun.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up and play, the controls and mechanics are simple and none of that convoluted stuff, which I feel is a great thing.  I don't want to spend an hour learning about wierd game mechanics when all I want to do is just destroy enemies.\n\nThe soundtrack is excellent it has a "pop" feel to it and really gets you pumped up to fight enemies.\n\nDownside to this as others have mentioned already is the lack of online multiplayer.  To me this is not a big deal because I am mainly a singleplayer type of person, and from a singleplayer standpoint this game is still excellent.  Although having other people to play with would be awesome, but not needed.\n\nAnother downside that you may not like is the length of the game.  It is pretty short, took me about 3 hours to beat.  Again, I'm not super hardcore, just an average player, so hopefully this will give you an idea on game length vs. cost of the game.  BUT there are 4 total characters at the moment each one with their own special skill set, and a selection of weapons to use, so if you're the type that likes to replay games, then you will totally get more hours out of this game.\nThere is also a light stat system where you can upgrade your mech stats such as strength and defense.\n\nTo summarize, you should definitely pick up this game especially if you like mechs :D","November 12, 2015","true","20.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

Stardust Galaxy Warriors is an instant classic that reminds me of those days. Who doesen't love the idea of flying around as a big robot blasting bad guys and cutting them in half with a sword.\n\nIf I had to label the game I would say "Fresh Nostalgia". The music is classic and not boreing. The leveing system is reminiscent of Radient Silvergun, but covering a wider range of in game stats and abilities.  It is rare that you find a game that instantly give you that "Happy/Good" feeling while playing. This game is a hit in my opinion. It may not be true bullet hell but it is worth checking out.\n\nI hope for more selectable characters, weapons, and stages as DLC will be released. An update to allow for online Co-op would be a great addition.\n\nNote: I play with a wired xbox 360 controller, and have not tested the keboard and mouse controlls as of yet.\n\nIf you like Jets n'Guns gold on steam, you will like this title.","November 10, 2015","true","4.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lunaclysm/recommended/389650/","lunaclysm","Auraclysm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lunaclysm/","274 products in account","Pros:\n* Mechs have well defined roles (tank, ranged dps, melee dps, and evasion) which allows for synergy between players (tanks deflecting bullets and making everyone invincible to help those who are less familiar with this type of arcade-style game, sniper marking targets to take more damage from all sources, melee dps slowing time for everyone, ...)\n* Good amount of customization between picking a mech, a main weapon, and a sub weapon, which are all available immediately. Also frequent upgrades (usually 2) in the middle of levels that allow you to build towards your defined style (such as being a sniper and picking up crit upgrades) as well as a shop at the end of each level that allows for spending points towards more upgrades.\n* Tons of game customization (enemy durability, player shot speed, hibox radiuses, spawn rate, fire rate... just about all low level manipulation you can think of). Lots of presets available, so you can easily switch between 5 difficulties' worth of settings, as well as extra presets like "Iron Man" where you have 0% shield multiplier.\n* Lots of environments - from frozen skies to exploding suns, underwater wrecks to alien hives, gas giants to robot factories, there's 10 locations in all with quite a bit of variety.\n* Can jump right in with the gauntlet mode - basically a never-ending mode (well, until you die) where you go for the high score.\n\nCons:\n* Story dialogue / plot is seemingly intentionally bad, but just ends up being unfunny and adding very little. Anime avatars for the characters seem a bit out of place. Wish I could turn it off entirely.\n* Would really benefit from having online multiplayer (as well as would probably sell a ton more copies. I know I'd be able to get some more friends to play it with me if it had online).\n* Achievements would be a nice touch, as it would give me more reason to play and try out all the mechs / weapons solo (and more reason to spend time in gauntlet mode).\n\nOther:\n* Pretty quick game - around 2-3 hours. Want to call this a con, but can be a pro if you have trouble spending lots of time with friends after school/work since this game only has local co-op - it does mean you can beat this game in one sitting though, from start to finish.\n* Music is ok (opinion), although if I bought the soundtrack it'd probably only be for a few tracks (namely the last boss ones, because that fight had multiple phases and is pretty exciting)\n\nUpdate Feb 2016 - it does look like they are listening to users, and they added a bunch of new upgrades, a new level, steam achievements and a bunch of other little features while I wasn't looking. Definitely a plus, and it rips out one of my few cons about the game.","November 22, 2015","true","10.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

You need more than that? Really? Oh well, fine:\n\nSGW is a fast paced single player/co-op sidescroller shoot 'em up with light hearted humor along the way. The mechs all get a primary and secondary weapon to use(primary one being mostly something fast like a minigun and secondary something heavier like a grenade launcher) and they also have a melee attack to slash through enemies with. Every mech also gets their own distortion ability(superpower) and another special attack(like Silver Wolf can make a quick dodge dash). Several difficulties to choose from and if you aren't content with the base ones, make your own to use. There is a campaign mode where you progress through several maps, varied enemies/bosses and get upgrades along the way and then theres a gauntlet mode which goes on until you die(or get tired). Fully playable alone or with some friends, especially due to quick and easy customization of difficulty. The developers are also very responsive to feedback and are quick to fix whatever bugs or issues might come up.

It is quite pretty. The enemy variety is quite good so far. There a few small cosmetic glitches I have noticed (spacing of menu options) but this is quite rare. Played with K/M, but would be much better with a standard controller.\nOverall, a very pleasant experience. Will play much more in the future.","May 7","true","8.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But the inclusion of an upgrade shop made the enemies too easy, right? Well then you crank up the enemy health to 300%, enemy fire rate 300%, and your own health to 20% to get a true bullet hell experience. This creates absolute chaos and I love it.\n\nStory:\nIt's a pretty standard story with plots of alien rulers, missing ships, etc. Characters are not memorable, but their design adds a charm to the game. The writing however, is pretty funny.\n\nVisuals:\nUnlike the characters, the environments were all very unique with enemies to match. Underwater enemies actually look like they belong underwater. The space environments look pretty wicked, and the projectiles are flashy and feel like they belong in a bright, chaotic space battle.\n\nMusic:\nIf you like upbeat, intense electronica, then you'll like this.\n\n","May 12","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Unlike a bunch of western-made mecha games, this one is less "lol, mecha cliches" and more just nonsense, which I found more entertaining and less rehashed. I mean, it's a game in which the final boss's first form is a giant disco ball.\n\nUnfortunately, though, it's also a game with a major problem - it took me about 90 minutes to complete the campaign on the default difficulty settings, during which I only died once, and rarely came close to death on any other occasion. Unless you mess with the settings to make things very difficult on yourself, it's just ... not a difficult game, between your small hitbox, taking several hits on your armor to kill (and being able to repair that damage), having regenerating shields on top of that, and frequently being able to destroy enemies before they can pose a real threat to you, as well.\n\nThis also causes the customization system to feel kind of futile, since I never really saw any reason to play as anything but the first combination I found that I liked - the Blue Falcon with the Taranis LB-02 plasma shotgun and Mjolnir UG-08 particle beam, which I settled on pretty quickly after realizing that I didn't like the Vajra 75-ZS pulse rifle. As in, I basically completed the entire game with the second weapon set I tried, without the game ever making me think a different setup might be useful for certain stages.\n\nAs a result, I'm not entirely sure I can recommend it for its current price of $10. (Well, $9 as of this writing, due to the launch discount.) It's probably fine if you want to spend time messing with the settings to challenge yourself, or if you're just not that good at shoot-'em-up games, but ... eh. Kind of a letdown, ultimately, given how many things Vasara Entertainment got right.","November 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 12 of 34 people (35%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","35","12","34","0","5"

Its a great horizontal arcade 2D shooter in its own right, but the RPG elements make it unique. Has a very PS3 look and feel to it. Right off the bat I noticed the trigger buttons were my firing button, kudos. Lets face it this game is meant for a console controller, not an arcade stick. Very much in the vain of SkyForce Anniversary, the RPG elements really bring a lot of replayability to the floor. With so many 'ports' coming to STEAM, its a breath of fresh air to see a title like this one. I really don't mind pixel graphics, but so many bad ports in general. I honestly have no idea if this game is a port or an original, but I can assure you, its done right! I love a good arcade shooter, Raiden III/IV, Crimson Cover, Mushihimesama etc, but after a few continues and 15-20 minutes I'm watching the end credits. But as PC gamers we sort of want a little more depth and replayability. No its not as deep as SkyRim, nor was it ever meant to be. If you are like me, love anime, mechs and video games, its a must have!\n\n","December 26, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It didn't detect the max refresh rate or resolution, so I relaunched the game and all was well. I did have to set it up to the maximum resolution though.\n\nOn to the game itself. This appears to be a co-op bullet hell that you can customize the experience of. The graphics are crisp, the music is catchy, and it looks to support both K&M and Xbox style controllers (based on the graphics shown, though I admit I don't have a Dualshock 4 to test with).\n\nOn my system, (2600K @ 4.3Ghz, 16GB DDR3 1600 CL9, and a GTX 980) it runs beautifully at 2560x1440, I can't detect any framerate drops, but I'm also using a G-Sync monitor.\n\nCharacter selection is small, but the items within them are significant, I look forward to pressing on and figuring out what my favorite options are.\n\nBack to the Galaxy I go now!","April 26","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
