Avoid the obstacles while cruising down neon highways to the amazing soundtrack by Chipzel. If you don't believe me just take a listen for yourself. http://chipzel.co.uk/album/spectra\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQSQQOZejXQ\nDownsides are the inability to use your own music, no visible global leaderboards and sometimes procedural nature of track generation could be a little unfair. Mostly due to the camera being zoomed in quite low and hitting blind hills. Keyboard and gamepad both worked well but no mouse control was supported. 10 levels included with standard and hardcore modes for each. Screen resolution scaled upto 4k+. Decent game in shorter bursts. Cheers folks.","July 10, 2015","true","2.0"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","27","37","2","0"

In the end, I chose a thumbs up.)\n\n"Spectra held great potential but the end result is too simple for its own good. The gameplay is intriguing but it never evolves and is plagued be repetition as are its visuals. One could make an argument its main draw is in the scoring system and attempting to beat it, but with no online leaderboards this too fails to meet expectations. At least it offers a stunning soundtrack."\n\nFull Review: http://www.tech-gaming.com/spectra-review/","July 13, 2015","true","2.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","10","14","2","0"

I like the concept of it, very simple with great atmosphere. But i wish there were checkpoints. Being at 60-70+ done on the map to only wipe out at the end really kills the vibe. Even if it starts you at half way, It would be so much better than starting all over again. That or i wish the maps were just a bit shorter. Thats all personal preference though.

There are little touches in each level's design that show that each area is indeed different, despite not appearing so at first. This works in the games favor, because after playing the game for a few minutes and going through each song, the tracks could start to bleed together in a macabre painting of bleeps and bloops if the soundtrack was too uniform the tracks are set up in such a way that it never gets to that point, unless you try the same stage over and over again.\n\nThe players' struggle for perfection might also be hampered by the sometimes unfair obstacle placement which, while it is avoidable, requires a sort of hair-trigger reaction time that not even the most seasoned Counter Strike players have. It's when your ship is going downward on a track and then in suddenly tilts up, and it's very likely that there will be a block in the way causing you to lose a certain number of points. This can be increasingly frustrating when you've built up a lot of points up until this section and you end up losing them all to a randomly placed block. That's the issue with procedurally generated levels: you're never quite sure on what you'll get and there will be times that it does seem that the game is stacking the deck against you. While it does test your mettle, it can be frustrating and cause quite a few outbursts of profanities.\n\nFull Review[www.noobfeed.com]","July 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

During my time with the title, I found the game to be fun and compelling to want to do better but feel the game is not making full use of it's potential by not including a multiplayer component like a versus mode which I feel would work excellently with this title.\n\nOverall while I do recommend the title, I do so cautiously due to the lack of diversification in the levels and amount of them (10). However the main attraction in this title is the stellar soundtrack which was upbeat throughout. I will say pick this up but at discounted price as I feel £5.99 is a little steep for the amount of content currently available.","December 10, 2015","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Keep your ship on the track, steer it away from danger, and collect points. Hit an obstacle and you lose your current score chain. The game focuses more on the score attack aspect than actually completing the track, though for obvious reasons, completing a track gives the player more opportunity to build his or her score. There's 10 tracks total, and a hardcore version of them as well, offering the player a decent amount of gameplay.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VIvQHbbXEY\nVisually the game looks great, with a cyberpunk, almost Tron aesthetic. The music and audio are great as well, with fantastic upbeat chiptunes that fit right into the game's atmosphere. Presentation wise, I have no complaints.\n\nThough the game is simple, yet challenging, it does suffer a little from monotony. Though each progressing track get harder and harder, it's really more of the same, but with more obstacles, or an extra turn. As far as variety is concerned, the game lacks in the department.\n\nOverall, Spectra is a very easy to learn, yet hard to master game. It has a nice polished presentation, and ideal for the who like score attack games, or as a distraction from your more main staple games.\n\nPros:\n- Polished presentation\n- accessible\n- Challenging Gameplay\n\nCons:\n- Repetitive","July 10, 2015","true","0.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The interesting element here is actually the point system: the idea being you collect points and need to run out a timer before collecting the points, but with all the hazards and points around you, that can be more difficult then meets the eye. The game's core gameplay is good: it plays to twitch reactions and gives you room to experiment as you skirt along barriers and the edge for extra points. It's the staying power that lacks: the game has 10 tracks, and while the levels are procedurally generated, that only goes so far as a lack of hazards/traps shows. The game is solid at what it does, but don't expect it to keep your attention for a long period of time.\n\nGameplay Footage and Video First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S7U93DOhNA\n\nLists:\n\n+:\nSolid gameplay mechanics in particular with the point system and the risk/reward elements that it creates\nControls work to the games advantage giving you the level of control you need without it being too forgiving.\nVisuals and transition to the PC work reasonably. It's a mobile port, however, it was available on windows phone, so availability was limited.  Also love the gameboy in there even if it doesn't make sense\n-:\nVariety over a period of time.

The art style tickles my 90's nostalgia, and music is fantastic.\nTracks are quite long, longer than I'm use to, but they feel nice due to how well the music blends with the overall game.\n\nThe objective is simple, get to the end of the track with the highest points and time possible. You do this by running into little cubes to up your points, and over arrows to build up speed. Be careful though, if you hit any obstacle it massively reduces speed and knocks off points. You can also easily go off the edge, failing you instantly.\n\nMy main concern is the drift like nature of your vehicle. While it handles well enough, it has a dissatisfying glide/drift to its movement. I would except a twitch based racer to handle a bit tighter. Even so, it doesn't detract much from the game, and you quickly get use to it. After miserably falling of the track and running into things.\n\nThe game certainly kept me on the edge of my seat at time, especially after hitting triple arrows a few times in a go, and then suddenly seeing a tight maze of blocks to navigate through at high speed while trying to get my cubes for my score; all while desperately trying not to fall off the edge.\n\nIs the game perfect? Not at all, I still don't like the glide/drift movement of the vehicle much. Even so it does a great job and I do enjoy it. Especially the music. It's a shame the soundtrack costs so darn much as I really like it and would even just buy it for that alone.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRFL3chdrSM","July 10, 2015","true","1.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

The scoring system is interesting since you earn points by doing dangerous actions (like touching the walls), but be careful, if you bump into them, you lose your multiplier (you gain multiplier with boost on the floor) AND the point you accumulated from your chains.\n\nAt first, you have to take the maximum of Yellow Pixels you can. Don't take everything if you know that you'll lose them.\n\nSo if you wanna score well, you have to know when you have to take a break, resetting your multiplier to zero but counting the accumulated points to your total points. Those points cannot be lost.\nBe careful to not fall from the track, because it's game over.\n\nAwesome game, and Chipzel is a really big plus. <3","July 10, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game could and should be so much better but instead it feels like so much wasted potential.\n\nThe controls are terrible: You'll be sliding dramatically left and right even with the slightest press of the controls, as if the entire game is covered in a thick sheet of ice. In a game where obstacles are often placed in rapid succession, this makes it almost impossible to actually avoid everything. If you're lucky, you'll grind off the side of something and get bonus points. If you're not, you'll bounce off of the very same thing and fly off the track, immediately ending the level.\n\nThe levels are procedurally generated in such a way that you can get a different track even when playing the same stage at a different time, so while this adds some variety it also makes the game feel even more inconsistent. It feels like the the music should be synced to the gameplay but it never is. This might be in part because the start-of-level animation also starts the music, meaning you can skip up to 15 seconds of the song just by letting that play out.\n\nThere are plenty of smaller quirks that make the game feel unsatisfying and frustrating. If it detects a controller, you can't interact with the game using keyboard and mouse at all; it will refuse to cooperate. When using keyboard and mouse, you have to use the keyboard in the game but the mouse to navigate everything else: you can't use mouse controls like in Audiosurf and there is no way to quickly replay a level or advance to the next without using the mouse. Smaller issues, such as an in-game timer that always shows 0 tenths of a second, pale in comparison to the greater problems with this title.","January 4","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
