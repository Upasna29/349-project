It used to be an amazing game I admitted. But if you're looking to come back for the good old days, there's not much iRO can offer here.\n\n1) Pay2Win system:\nIt is against term of service to purchase in-game gold (zeny) using real cash. Yet it is ok to sell your warp portal energies into zeny ( which is obtained by cash). So the only way to cheat is to give money to WarpPortal.\n\nCash shop items also rendered many other in-game gear useless. And the only way to upgrade safely to +9 is to choke up $20-$50 in game cash for it.\n\n2) Cheaters\nThere are so many bots in this game. Honestly I only see around 100-300 active players in game, and the rest are either bots, vend bots, or afkers. Worst part is some bots are actually ok, I see them roaming around cities buffing people, and somehow that makes everything ok? Also there's this thing called ragial which is obviously run by third party bot systems.\n\n3) Lag issues and DDOS:\nIt's 2015 and this game is still constantly lagging and I am using 75mbps fiber optics internet.  Also their servers keep crashing very often,  and usually at the worst time of the day.\n\n4) Immature game design decision:\nFor those who paid for VIP for leveling, the GM sometimes decide to change the turn in quests so impossibly difficult that only godly geared veterans can do them. So you're likely wasting 1 week of VIP time afking or slow grinding your level. Also good luck finding public parties to play with outside of the turn ins.\n\n5) Slow customer support:\nIt literally takes them days weeks or months to answer ticket issues. Worst part is they will just ban you and give you no reason sometimes. So you have to open them a ticket just to find out that some of the items you bought may came from a cheater, causing you to have weeks of downtime.\n\n6) Good luck finding players to play with.\nFinally, good luck finding enough players to play with. It's a dying game, and most of the time you'll be spending time waiting for a party to setup (30min - 3 hours recruiting time just to setup 15 minute leveling session)\n\n\nI'd say save your money folks. The old days of Ragnarok is loong gone.","June 14, 2015","false","126.8"," 95 of 117 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","95","117","4","4"

I have not played on the Renewal server.\n\nIn terms of a decade old MMORPG, Ragnarok really hits home for the nostalgia factor. Gameplay is still smooth and fun. I quite enjoy playing.\n\nThat said....\n\nThe botting is rampant, don't bother trying to sell anything through vending. Someone has more on sale for less because bots.\nWar of Emperium is a cycle of 3-4 guilds exchanging castles on a weekly basis. If you want to try and bring a new guild in, be prepared to be squashed by maxed out veterans wearing god-items.\nThe market is beyond skewed. The botters have so much on the market that you are LUCKY if you keep a vigilant eye on sites like ragial.com for good deals, as some poor sap tries to undercut the botters of their excessive amounts of loot.\nTo counter the botters, folks will often crack "dead branches" (spawns high-level mobs) where bots frequent in an attempt to grief kill them. Chances are you will die a few dozen times to these things walking from Prontera to Izlude or just trying to get to your hunting grounds.\n\nLogging on, the server is usually at 500+ players. Of that, I suspect 150-200 are vending and about 100 are actual human players. The rest are botting.\n\nWith the population so low, it does make the game a bit more fun, in terms of not having to fight over mob spawns (unless it is a profitable area with decent returns, in which case you'll be fighting with botters for mobs) and Prontera is, pretty much, the only place one will find Vendors. There are some in Payon, sometimes. Ragial.com's bot only survery's Prontera/Payon, so why vend elsewhere?\n\nThere are constant "jump" events. Events where people can take their character from lvl 1 to 70 in a day with a few simple quests.\n\nFalling outside of the 15 level limit for shared exp in parties will leave you lonely and bored as the rest of your guild refuses to help you catch up because there is no profit for them in it, despite having helped them along...\n\n\nTL;DR, plan to play a solo game and you'll have fun. If you played this back in the day, Classic Loki is, pretty much, exactly the same game you played 10 years ago.\n\nDespite all the annoying and frustrating things I listed above, I still like the game. I just wish there were fewer botters. :(","January 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 36 of 36 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","36","36","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xiiram/recommended/215100/","xiiram","Hyo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xiiram/","1481 products in account","Ragnarok Online was for me the best MMORPG out there, but its official servers confront some issues mong them:\n\nI. Economy. The cash shop of Ragnarok Online offers a lot of powerful hats and items, that aren't available normally inside the game, of course, you can purchase some of those items with IGC if someone else is selling them at the market, but this has two issues: 1. A player can become rich in a short amount of time by purchasing items from the Cash Shop and then selling them for IGC. Making it completely unbalanced for F2P users. 2. The price of those items is so high, it demands a ridiculous amount of effort to acquire only one item. It's funny how is illegal to sell IGC for real money and yet is OK to sell Cash Shop Items bought with real money for IGC.\n\nII. Bots. The game is plagued with them. There are many solutions to deal with bots, but, either, Gravity got tired of trying or just didn't try hard enough.\n\nIII. Lag. The server has lag peaks, not only on WoE time, but at any other time as well, it makes it horrible to play, even when alone. The problem must be either, the way the servers are distributed or their capacity, which is strange, considering there aren't that many active players nowadays.\n\nIV. Rates. People grow and time decreases, the rates of experience and drop of the game are so demanding, that you either, have a lot of time in your hands or you can forget about getting anywhere inside the game, it doesn't particularly appeal to new players and it didn't adapt it to its actual player base, causing a constant drop of users.\n\nAs you see, those problems could be easily fixed, but Gravity never seemed to care about them, that's why, if you still want to play Ragnarok Online, I'd highly suggest you a private server instead.\n\n‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ | Loved it, but disliked iRO servers","November 15, 2015","false","10.4"," 78 of 103 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","78","103","6","0"

I played Ragnarok Online religiously before it was released on steam and while it was on steam. Although it seems my hours are not logged, They are there. I have had the best times in this game. It really breaks my heart to not recommend this game.\n\nBest friends of mine who played this for decades, girl friends who hated my soul for WoE timed events, craziest card drops that changed the whole tide of war, awesome battles in WoE, and PvP. Please beleive me. I am trying to warn you of your current time.\n\nYear 2000. Alpha and Beta stages all alike. This game was the best MMORPG you would ever of played, even surfacing vanilla WoW Imo if u had a chance to play it. PVP and Guild WoE slaughtered the idea of capture a flag.\n\nSince around 2005 till now its cash shop has screwed and spread like a virus crossing the korean world and globably to not just this game but many others. It has ruined this game. This game is also ran on a bot fest economy, if it isn't then problems start showing up. This is another hatred of many. But the problem is that its needed, yet not allowed, supposedly lol.\n\nThis game has turned into a phantasmal ghost yet people still feed into it and I can't blame them, It's beautiful. Not alot of games come close to the joyous, no holding of the hand feel of entering a world such as midgard. There is always something to do unless you have it all. Venturing map to map as your cool class, seeing and slaying awesome pixel monsters, hopefully with friends. Hearing some classic music that makes your nostalgic sense kick in always, and collecting items such as cool hats, accesories, and of course those cards. Gosh, next to increasing your skills and stats through an allocation system. You will never wanna leave.\n\nBut heres the hard truth. This free game still lives because of the real life dirty money still being pulled through botting and idiocracy. You either need to be in this game to be slaving someone, becoming a botter, or selling into the cash shop. But why not do it all? Lol. Zero game experience\n\nIt will never shine like it used to and as a retired vet take my word of advice. You are better playing on a private server or just a different game. The people playing this game are mainly young millennials experiencing a zombie game full of bright colors and cool effects being mislead, or adults still milking this game dry.\n\nDo not be mislead by my words.\n\nR.I.P.

Yes it's old like other people have said but it's graphics were setup in  way so they don't age. Wonderfull 2D sprites in a amazing easy on the eyes 3D world. I've actual played this game since late Alpha, early Beta, about the 1999-2000 time frame. And I still play to this day, though mainly on the classic server.\n\nBeside the easy on the eye graphics another amazing feature is the customization you can do with your character's stats and skills. Unlike nearly every other game on the market you stats matter. Your character's ablity will change massively based on what stats you take.\n\nWant a Swordsman that dodges attacks and hits faster instead of just taking hits and having high hit points ? Put points in to Agility instead of Vitality. This means you trade High Hitpoints and high defense for High Flee (dodge) and high Attack speed. You then could go on to make a Agility based knight or Crusader with your swordsman. Or go the middle of the ground and do a hybrid of Agility and Vitality, You might not dodge as well as pure agility or have as much hitpoints as pure Vitality but you can take less damage per hits then agility based characters, and dodge more then pure vitality.\n\nAnd this is just the start of it, You can go pure support acolyte forgoing increased melee damage for the ability to heal massive amounts of damage, or for a true acolyte and have a mix of Melee damage and Healing ability.\n\nWant a Mage that beats things as well as toss magic at them? Put points into Strength, Vitality, and Agility, instead of going pure intelligence. You lose magic damage but can dodge, take hits, and do better melee damage then a pure magic caster. Go the sage route and get the skills that let you move while casting and add the chance to auto cast a low level bolt spell while your hitting monsters.\n\nLike making money, while beating on things with axes, swords or maces? Go a Merchant class character. They don't have the Melee skills of other classes but you can carry more loot or healing potions items then any other class, can buy cheaper and sell for more then any other classes, have access to a cart to carry even more loot/potions, and use your fortune to pay the god of the merchants to attack your enemies (Mammonite skill). Want to craft potions or weapons, take your Merchant to ether Alchemist or Blacksmith. And even Blacksmith and Alchemist have the ability to go Pure Battle, pure Crafting, or a Middle ground, not building items as well as their pure counter parts but still being able to fight for themselves.\n\nAnd there are many other classes to chose from like Archers, thief, TaeKwon Kid, Ninja, Gunslinger ans Super Novice. On top of all that it's free to play, with subscription players (only 7 bucks a month) only get 50% more experience and loot drops, larger storage and other minor abilities. I've spent most of my time since it's gone free to play not using a subscription (they call it VIP) and had no problems with it. So give it a try, nothing to lose but a lot of your free time, and a lot of fun to be had.\n\nedit: fixed some spelling issues","May 2, 2014","true","1.5"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","23","28","0","0"

Where do i even start,  For starters i am what you would call an old time veteran when it comes to Ro1. This game and me go way back, I couldn't even tell you how many years/months/days i have spent running around in this game. This is one of those classics situations where i have a sudden wave of nostalgia and emotion run through my head just thinking about it.\n\nNow, here's the nitty. I have of course played this game, i was an avid hard core player of Ragnarok, But i moved on to other things and basically rarely ever turned back unless i was just casually hopping on to see what changed or for nostalgia purposes. And let me tell you this game is not the game it was back in 2002-2007. Oh no, The new IRO is just a mess of Trolls/Bots a very strange slapped on questing system as well as many other band-aided systems trying to keep this game afloat or up to par with what i would call mmorpg standardization. Many server merges causing lots of strange naming conflicts and renaming issues. Some people given free character name changes, While others somehow being skipped over.\n\nThe game at its core is still the same old Ragnarok, But the magic that is Rune Midgard has just somehow been lost somewhere down the road these past years. Partially the community, and just the way the game is ran, The game even seems to somehow run worse now than it did years ago, as if the Server technology has been downgraded even tho computers have gotten better.\n\n\nSo what is my final verdict? I would say give the game a shot, But don't go into the game expecting a lot, It's pretty laggy and seems very quiet at times. gravity definitely seems to be letting the game run its course, But on the bright side at least it seems to be alive and probably kicking for many years to come.","December 30, 2014","true","0.1"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

My username is a result of my love of RO.  I played on iRO all those years ago, and broke into tears when I hear the Prontera Theme for the first time in years.\n\nThing is, all that love is nothing more than rose tinted glasses now.  This game is old.  REALLY old.\n\nOld time Thief players (like me!) will easily understand that much of the combat is literally just "Right Click, AFK"  Sure it gets more involved once you go up against MVPs and play in PvP/WoE, but fact of the matter is that you still have to chew through the leveling to get there.  Fast travel is still "Blow entire newbie fortune on Kafra, or blow entire newbie fortune on FWing spam".  Unless you're a Priest.  There are also really archaic mechanics like how spell channeling is completely cancelled when you take damage; dumb fact, but that's the whole reason why I hate Mages to this day.\n\nThankfully, at least the graphics aged well.  The styalized look somehow managed to hold up for more than a decade, and the game itself could literally run on a toaster.  Also, you don't have to deal with ye olde iRO "Server Connection Failed" shenanigans as often as we used to, nor do you need to deal with a steep grind (by today's standards) due to the questing system...although said system is rather haphazardly cobbled together.\n\nIf you're an oldie, at least Warp Portal set up a Classic server because you'll be completely lost on the Renewal ones.  Quests are nice, but mob spawn locations and even spawn power were COMPLETELY overhauled.  Simple example: Zombies are now less dangerous than Skeletons.  The level of a Kobold is roughly 3x higher than it used to be.

There's just a certain charm to it.  On the surface this might seem like a usual simple grind-fest, however the game is very complex. Mainly because it gives you complete freedom to build your characters the way you want (and make many, many mistakes in the process).\nWant to build a battle-priest because you do not like monks? - go for it.  Want to make a full-crit assassin with the sole purpose of hunting high-def monsters? - go right ahead. The beauty is that with enough research and equipment planning you could make even the most bizzare character builds work.

At a quick glance - it may seem fun to you but however, the community of this game really makes up a lot of your in-game experience. Talking about community, this game has real players who gave you the cold shoulders because of the vast amount of bots in the game. Lot's of Philipino and Asian players, you know you could reach out to them and make some friends if you are one of them - and assuming they don't ignore you. They are generally cocky and arrogant, but few handful would still help you out if you are lucky enough to meet them. Noobs start out weak (of course) and without a proper guild, party and friends, its almost impossible to get powerful unless you spend on the game. Well, duh. That's the main purpose.\n\nThis game has a rich art base and many fans would draw them for fun, laughter, peace and joy. It's a 3D game, and a very successful one during its time - one would not simply ignore the art and just play the game. The art is great in my point of view and I do admit that their art makes me get hooked to the game. You will rave about the awesome sprite of your character, no matter the class you are in.\n\nThe core design of the game offers you guild wars, Player VS Player, vending, and turn-ins. (for exp) It's a wonderful world out there to explore as well, though you might just go for the shortcut and teleport around the world if you purchase their premium services. With that said, the design is very multiplayer heavy - and you will only gain from it if you play with someone else. There will be events held often in the game, be sure to take advantage of it and not miss it ! Wide diversity of classes, you will always find a class that suits you most. However, some special classes do not offer you rebirths - so you lack some extra stat and skill points which makes you weaker than most players.\n\nGraphics is cool. The skills animation are awesome in my opinion and they are truly worth raving about as you scale later on in to the game where you do job advancement for your character. There are items in the game that needs to be purchased in real cash to exchange for better graphical aesthetics. Other than that, the animation might be a little choppy due to the latency of the game - it depends on where you are from and all.\n\nSound. The reason why I gave sound a 9/10 is because they are really awesome. You can grab them in your directory for free as well, and I have used the BGMs of this game before in my school projects as well. They have a wide range from classical to metal, and different maps invoke your feelings and really puts you into the world of Ragnarok with their music.\n\nSummary: Do NOT try to play this game alone, because you will probably ragequit due to all these bots who would KS you and helpdesk takes a super long time in looking and solving your queries. It can be a very fun game despite my critics, you should try this timeless game out before giving judgement of your own. Support the game if you like it, but I would highly doubt it because of poor customer service. Lastly, great way to kill time with your friends! I have hundreds of playing hours in this game and and made awesome lifelong friends - talking about a gamer for 4 good years in here.","May 15, 2014","true","441.0"," 19 of 34 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","19","34","0","1"

Don't mistake RO for being a downgrade from its 'sequel' Ragnarok Online 2 - as both games are almost nothing alike and RO2 is a very disappointing 'sequel' for any old RO fan out there.

Èõ® ]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rizno/","745 products in account","Rangarok Online (RO) was one of my very first MMORPG games, and quite an amazing experience it was. The graphical art style and blend of 2D/3D looks very good and pleasing to the eyes, especially for a 2003 video game. But what really gives me the most nostalgic value was the soundtrack, RO has one of the greatest soundtracks to ever exist and has always been very memorable for me and thousands of other players around the world. Don't mistake RO for being a downgrade from its 'sequel' Ragnarok Online 2 - as both games are almost nothing alike and RO2 is a very disappointing 'sequel' for any old RO fan out there. Play this if you haven't already, and ignore RO2's existence. You can thank me later.","November 2, 2013","true",""," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, a MMORPG cannot be a good MMORPG without a playerbase, because without one, that would make it a single-player game. The single-player experience and MMO experience of the same game is totally different.\n\nThat said, the "playerbase" of the current RO is just what all MMORPG suffers from; AFKers as well as bots, automated third-party programs that does the grinding for you.\n\nI can't recommend RO on Steam.

The only problem I have with this game would be that I have the hardest time getting my character to actually walk where I tell them to.

And it is your job to become the hero, and drive the evil away from the once peaceful lands. The real question is. Is this game really the story driven game that the description says it is? Does your killing of monsters do anything to help the world? Technically, no. Once you create your character, you will either take the tutorial, or go straight to the main game. This often makes players feel very lost at the start of the game. But other then that, once you are on your way, you will very well be on your way to bash monsters around and make friends! It's that simple! Ragnarok Online is just the perfect game for starters of the MMORPG genre. If you are looking for a MMORPG and are just dieing to try one out, this may be the one for you.

Classic, RePlay, and their newest edition. I've been a constant fan ever since they first started; I still remember when they had issues properly coding the 'Bash' move for swordsmen. I started playing their newest server, and though it stays reminiscent of what I'm used to, it seems to have molded for the future that MMOs in general have carved out for themselves. Instead of monthly fees, they have a cash shop. They make items for new interesting events thta I wish I could take place in, for say, the hat quests, but even though I am a high enough level to collect the items, I am not a high enough level to initiate the holiday event. I find that fairly irritating, personally. Holiday events should be available to all, and accomplished by those whom can, but it shouldn't be limited to those that spend hours and hours, if not possibly days in front of their computer trying to speed level in order to catch the event in time.\n\nBut, that's just an event. The market has certainly changed. I remember when a 4-leaf clover costed millions because of what you had to go through in order to afford it. You would have to painstakingly kill hundreds or thousands of vine whipping stationary, but pretty mean monsters, pretty much giving up the hours you normally would use to level in order to find that one item. Now, they're being sold on market for 50k. Advanced drop rate? Or is it because they're so easily accessible now as a chance item in Giftboxes?\n\nI have more virtues than vices for this game still. There are things that have changed, things that I wish was still what I am used to, but I can always play the 'classic' server. I still love the community, and it's pretty social! It's still worth hours of fun, and some time I want to see them have cool achievements for Steam for me to accomplish. I highly recomend this game as a simple MMO that has been striving with a several thousand person community for about ten years. It was my first MMO, and it will probably be my last, at that. Why? Because every time I step away from it, one month later I get another random craving for it and end up running right back to this amazing community.","January 14, 2014","true","35.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first two, League of Legends and Dofus, really weren't the greatest thing- hence role playing games aren't my selectable game genre. But Ragnarok is quite pleasurable for casual gamers.\n\nThe game features the usual Role Playing tactic in which you build your character in your first few levels, then take a pernmament "job" that determines the type of player you play forever. Of course, some people might get bored of their class eventually, but Ragnarok makes up for this lack. Ragnarok allows you to have three character profiles at a time. So if you are willing to start fresh or try another character class, you can! No more having to stick to one destiny for the rest of\nE T E R N I T Y .\n\nRagnarok can be confusing to new players, the game is open freely and vast, and easy to get lost in. you will spawn at first near the heart of the entire game map, from there you can build up your job skill, then be let go into the depths of Ragnarok's world. All areas have different mobs that can be passive or hostile, they also vary by Level everywhere. You can find a relaxing spot here and there with easy passive mobs, or you can run into a mob that is 40 levels HIGHER than you, and it WILL ATTACK you at it's will. This leaves gamers to be adventureous, alert, and competitive. This concept is what probably brings in my attention.\n\nRagnarok is also fun to play with friends. Beacause it is Free to Play, you can ask your friend to join without any worries. The probable downside is you have to create an account on their website, which shouldn't be too hard if you have spare emails for probable spam.\n\nI highly recommend this game to great RPG players who are looking for challenge, Ragnarok, despite the other RPGs I have played, really adds up to have many differences that give players more freedom. Role Playing Gamers would not be disappointed.\nI somewhat recommend this game to those who casually play RPGs, Ragnarok Online is a great game to play on your spare time, but sometimes you can get really lost like me - if that happens.... pray that you'll make it back without dying, or just die and respawn at the heart of the map, you get to keep your stuff, but you loose some of your experience.

I am now 23, and although I don't play it anymore; I can safely say that it is THE game of my childhood. Its an emotional, beautiful, breathtakingly HUGE, diverse, complicated and a time-consuming adventure. I am confident that over 15 months of my life were spent on this game, (or atleast with the game open overnight so that I could set up a market, or so that I could idle in a town and fall asleep to the gorgeous soundtrack.)\nObviously this game is old, but it has soul. Mmorpgs do not have soul these days. WoW has no soul, Ragnarok 2 most likely has no soul, but RO1 is the epitome of beauty in the gaming world.\nIf this isn't your thing, (grinding, patience, socialising) then maybe a private server would suit you more, but if you want a true experience then download this game now and don't waste a second.

Hitting 99 lets you become an improved class with new skills and higher stats, and hitting 99 again lets you break the cap as an entire new class and go for 150 with another whole skill tree. There is no specific path to take in the game, you can go anywhere at any time assuming you can survive. The farther you get from a town, the stronger the enemies become, and it's not uncommon to get into dangerous or challenging situations facing a horde of enemies. The game is best played with friends or a guild IMO, but out of 10 years of online gaming, i haven't played an overall better MMO, especially from KR.","November 2, 2013","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I first played back in 2004, when it was still a P2P and when Payon still had it's old map up. Everytime I feel like playing RO, I would buy either a P100 or P350 everytime, this was before I discovered private servers lol. While iRO used credit cards, pRO used prepaid cards. I was ecstatic and overjoyed when I found out it is now Free to Play. As a veteran player, I have enjoyed this game over the years. The community is friendly but not too mellow. Crazy things happen, and by "crazy" I mean wacky... in a good way, like having fun. I love the players here. They are friendly and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t rarely ever happens... only thing annoying now are the pesky bots roaming around the hunting maps (this never happened back then and don't worry, they don't appear in all maps). But they can be overlooked if you just simply ignore them, they don't KS or anything really.\n\nThe gameplay itself is mediocre, considering it's a point-and-click, nothing too fancy. The sprites are adorable and the 3D background graphics are astonishing. The Eden and event quests are really fun to do. The tutorials teach you the basics really well and you get good stuff. There is a massive number of job class branches to choose from. (My favorite is the Assassin branch followed by the Wizard branch~) The merchant class is are something that is not so common in MMOs, so that's a plus too. There's also the guild siege or WoE (War of Emperium) which is really fun. The reasons why I enjoyed this game are the friendly community and the cute sprites. Some monsters are cute too and you can make them as pets. I love the idea that the entire game was based on the Norse Mythology.\n\nTruth be told, this is actually a game and depending on your preferences, you might either like it or don't like it. This is because there's no specific plot or any major storyline (there are quest lines that tell interesting stories though) and point-and-clicks can be boring at times. However, in spite of these, the events, quest lines, cute sprite, creative and realistic 3D maps, the nice visual effects when you use skills and magic, rebirths, and the merchant class are all the reasons why this is a pretty good MMO.\n\nI recommend this MMO to those who prefer the classic style of gaming and/or 2D games, because this is what Ragnarok Online gives.

I would love to try this out again one day. I rate this game as one of the best MMORPG games around! There are so many job classes, including 2nd and 3rd jobs and a lot of maps to grind from. Quests isn't the main focus for this game but you will have to grind a lot in order to become useful in its best feature, the WOE (guild war). The WOE or War of Emperium is basically a guild vs guild taking over castles when its WOE time and it is the most enjoying part of the game!\n\nI also think this game has the BEST soundtrack of ALL MMORPGs around. I would sometimes login just to hear the music. Each city/map has their own theme song! My favorites are Prontera city, Gonyryun, Alberta, and even the WOE music!\n\nThe game does look childish because of its graphics but what do you expect from a very very old game? Try it out and meet people to guild with and get stronger and get better in WOE and you won't be disappointed.

Back then Ragnarok Online was entirely pay to play so in order to play, private servers were made. Until gravity made it free-to-play which made people play the original servers rather than private servers.\n\nSo, Ragnarok Online is a animated 3D fantasy MMORPG. Players can move around and explore the world through a simple yet polish point and click controls. Ragnarok Online has an interesting system where players have two levels, a base level and a job level, How you raise those levels is by gaining experience either by clearing quests or killing monsters, but the job level tends to level up slower. Each base level earns you status points that can be allocated into different attribute and each job level earns you job points which you can allocate into skills which the player can use.\n\nWhat makes Ragnarok Online feel like a complete game is the large selection of job advancements.","May 24, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Really showing what the game is about.\n\nI come from a background of private servers, back when this was still pay to play. I played midrate, and it was nice. When this turned F2P, I was like "Yeah, now I can see what the motherland is like!"\n\n...I regret this. Barely a few minutes in, I see why I was pointed to private servers. Shops. Shops everywhere. On the private servers you get reported and kicked if you trade anywhere but the designated markets. I can't walk without tripping over a shop selling god knows what. Even the less organized ones, people have the decency to stay on the sidewalk!\n\nExp rate is slow. I knew it would be. After all, the lowest rate I ever went on still gave 50x exp and job exp... I didn't anticipate, however, that you would be too weak to kill a single monster in less time than it took to make a cup of tea, and that this would only give you maybe half a novice level, and you'd just have to rinse and repeat over and over until you didn't suck. (Pro-tip: that's almost never.)\n\nJob changers are unfair, I admit. It cuts out a greater part of the game; the quests to change jobs... But good lord if I don't wish I didn't have to WALK to the towns to change my job. There should be a free transport like the old way, where it'd give you a tutorial on an island outside of shoptopia (Izlude and prontera), then ask "What do you want to be when you grow up" and dump you on the doorstep of the place that could teach you.\n\nFree transport is unfair too, but come on, at least a one way ticket for the newbies. I spend more time picking up dirt and garbage off the ground to sell, and walking from place to place at snail and a half rate than I do actually getting anything done. I can't afford a single health potion, what makes you think I can afford transport at those rates?\n\nAnother thing I noticed is that the translation is-.... Just bad. I mean, you're the main company. You should be able to afford proper translators. Somehow though, private servers STILL are better in this way. What the hell Gravity? The guy in the tutorial who snatched up items before I got there didn't annoy me for taking things, he annoyed me because he was translated so awfully!\n\nAlso, I know that there's pay to win in everything free these days. Doesn't make it anymore fair, especially when you offer something good, then take it off the market and giggle as prices in game rocket. That's just bad. If you pay for anything, it should be cosmetic only. That just being polite game devs, and not catering to the rich folk.\n\n...Also, the private servers block spell effect spam within major towns. Genius.\n\ntl;dr somehow the nigh-adminless, backwater near empty servers running based on charity alone are still better. Sure some features like free travel, skill resetters and job quest skips break part of the game, but the overall quality is better, and it's more fun to kill a monster and see an immediate increase in your strength, as opposed to just needing to continue to grind.\n\n...Plus it's nice to be able to walk without accidentally tripping into a shop called "DEAD CHILDREN".

I found it randomly on the internet when looking for games to play on my decade-old piece of scrap metal that was my last computer and, to my amazement, was pretty hooked. Back in the iRO days when I didn't have the money for a subscription I used to make multiple accounts just to play the 72-hour trial until I was told about private servers. Played those for a bit, found a few fun ones with a healthy population and then found out that WarpPortal had come out with RO for North America, free to play.\n\nBursting with excitement I left my friends from the private servers to play this new completely legit, completely free server and...bots. Bots everywhere. Not once would I ever be around levelling and come across someone who isn't botting in one way or another, which had me feeling really down. Even when I played iRO my most favorite thing to do was explore the scenic places with my friends (the floating islands near Geffen, ruins in Morroc, Prontera's west gate garden) and hang out. So now that I had upgraded my computer I have long since left Ragnarok behind...\n\nEvery now and then I get a rush of nostalgia that makes me want to play the game again and lo and behold I'm currently downloading it to play it again. Do I recommend this game to others? Absolutely. Botters aside, this game has an amazing soundtrack, neat places to explore and if you happen to come across a genuine player and you like each other, BE FRIENDS. Because you'll never know when another one like them will show up the next time you play.","July 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Maybe I've got my nostalgia goggles on or something, but I've always loved the art, pixel work, music and just overall feel to the game. (Although I will say the story itself and the dialogue is still -- since I started playing in 2004 -- some of the worst Engrish I've ever read. I can't understand a thing!)\n\nI've been playing the game since its launch in 2004 when it could barely run on my clunky, poorly-made computer and have been playing on and off since then. It's been over 10 years but I saw it on Steam and had to REALLY get back into it again. It's been a long time, but I think I can see what makes this game so addictive and yet so frustrating at the same time. At age 14 I was't exactly sure how to pinpoint the amazing things in this game, nor did I know how to word exactly what was wrong with the game, and how it got worse over the years.\n\nBasically there's about 394304034 bots, a Cash Shop which throws things off and the Engrish is so bad you can't understand the storyline if you tried. Also there's constant crashing and Gravity will ignore your emails for weeks until they feel bored and answer your question.\n\n10/10 would continue to play constantly and be treated like garbage","February 8","true","157.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","1","2","2","0"

The servers are animaRO, AnthemRO, CakeRO, HiddenRo, RareRo, mysticRO. I'm a huge fan of this game and well this server is the worst server i have ever played. I believe the conpany running the server is in it for the money but the thats not the only problem. So lets start with the money problem. I dont have a problem with dontations until the items are break the game or you get more exp for paying. This server does the ladder and that means there is a gap among the players. Next the server basically lets you bot. This kills the community aspect of this game. This leads to the guilds being unbalanced because people who pay have extra exp and bots that follow the person usually healing them. So this means the economy is unbalanced too. I estimate their to be about 300 actually people to be playing this server. Even the most experinced players would have a hard time in this enviroment. In the end, i wouldnt even bother with this server and i would go to ratemyserver and find a good server to play.

Even with this having been officially on Steam for a while, I still recommend finding a private server you like, instead.\n\nThe grind isn't *quite* as bad as it used to be as you do at least get your early levels and can start playing around with your class' skills a little earlier, and there's more ways to get experience than simply killing stuff now...you can get quests to kill a specific amount of stuff. Huge improvement, there.\n\nBecause of its slow progress, mid-to-late game grinding is best done in organized groups to improve the speed at which you kill mobs with coordination and drip-feeds of buffs and heals. Unfortunately, the official server's population is fairly volatile so finding these groups is going to be up in the air. Ragnarok has a somewhat archaic system in that by lategame if you're gonna be grinding alone, you might as well not bother - most mobs that give decent exp yields need at least a  minor degree of teamwork to take on, in part because few classes have the tools to manage aggro alone without running their MP batteries dry, so even those that can drop all the mobs after their blood spend a fortune on MP recovery without help.\n\nThe heart and soul of Ragnarok still exists, but you should seek it elsewhere.

Even with this having been officially on Steam for a while, I still recommend finding a private server you like, instead.\n\nThe grind isn't *quite* as bad as it used to be as you do at least get your early levels and can start playing around with your class' skills a little earlier, and there's more ways to get experience than simply killing stuff now...you can get quests to kill a specific amount of stuff. Huge improvement, there.\n\nBecause of its slow progress, mid-to-late game grinding is best done in organized groups to improve the speed at which you kill mobs with coordination and drip-feeds of buffs and heals. Unfortunately, the official server's population is fairly volatile so finding these groups is going to be up in the air. Ragnarok has a somewhat archaic system in that by lategame if you're gonna be grinding alone, you might as well not bother - most mobs that give decent exp yields need at least a  minor degree of teamwork to take on, in part because few classes have the tools to manage aggro alone without running their MP batteries dry, so even those that can drop all the mobs after their blood spend a fortune on MP recovery without help.\n\nThe heart and soul of Ragnarok still exists, but you should seek it elsewhere. The vanilla experience has too many flaws to let the game's strengths really shine.","December 11, 2015","false","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's all about the pay2win kafra shop, refine gambling simulator and kawaii hats. Lots of bots that populate AT LEAST 50% of Chaos server. After pRO closed down, all the pinoys have been segregated into Thor server where no one knows how to speak english and is 1/4 that many players than Chaos server. Everyone likes to RMT although most never admit it in forums and there is a dedicated facebook group for each server. Some get caught some don't. All MvP cards are account bound and you 'd have to trust a GM to verify if it is legittimate or not. Some GMs are so incompetent that A.) they dupe your card and consider it legit B.) they take it out because it is NOT legit C.) They ban you without giving an explanation. D.) They don't respond to you after 1 month. The community is so small you will the same people in-game over and over and over again. There is also this one outvoiced vet who plays sinx that is the reason why classic server gets DDOSed everytime and have had guilds perma banned. Now you know why classic server is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and will always be ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Better off playing private servers or yet play an AAA mmo like guilds wars 2 or WOW or FF14\n\n","February 17","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

Spelling and grammar is terrible, some sentences just make no sense at all. The very first quest you get as a tutorial from the Information Staff can't be completed because the "hidden item" is so well hidden - it's not there at all! The Warp Portal website that you must register with doesn't sync your login info to the rest of the site, like the forums. I tried to get into the forum to find out how to finish the tutorial quest, but it refused my login. When I tried to register, it refused my email address because it was "not available" which ostensibly means, it's all ready recognized and therefore I should be able to login with it! So far, I've been trying to play the game 2 hours, the first hour spent trying to find out how to switch from windowed to fullscreen because the in-game font is tiny and I couldn't enlarge it except to enlarge the window (fullscreen), the 2nd hour trying to get into their website, find support, submit a ticket, SOMETHING to help get past the tutorial. So, yeah, this game isn't worth this much hassle, save yourself the headache, play something else!","January 20, 2014","false","1.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

But, for some reason, the developers nowadays are sucks.. I really damn missed the old RO, where knights and crussaders holds the role of tank.. I really not recomended this game for a long term and serious game to play.. Since there's a lot of changes to it. Some classes are OP, and some classes are useless..\nPoint form for all review :-\nGameplay : for the sake of old memmories\nCurrency : uses a lot of cash item to survive in 3rd class (especially for 150 to 175)\nVariety of class usefull : less, only 5 classes that are really2 usefull (sura/tank, priest/healer, genetict/DPS, ranger/AOE, and maestro/strings) other than that are supportive classes\nResidence : almost 30% (or more) of the players boting on few maps\nGuild system : are not developted as a proper guild system should be. Example (guild bank, storage, etc)\nOther reviews :\n1. The game now kinda PAY TO WIN, since who have the good equips, wins.\n2. There's a bias on some class (on stats, and bonuses), classes are cosly are less.\n3. Party booking system are useless, and never used by anyone. (Plus it is not a proper system to called party booking system)\n4. Common server lag issues from the iro servers. (while stream any vids are fine, RO still lags)\n5. The Homunculus and Mercenaries AI didnt include in the RO package folder. (so u have to download it manually from 3rd party)\n\nAs a player who played since the beta, this game really2 changed from awesome to sucks. RO1 and RO2 have its own gameplay, but for players who likes to TANK, RO1 is the game that tankers can't use heavy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• armor and they wear robes. While in RO2 tankers works fine, but the gameplay are suckier than RO1.\n\nSo, thats my review for this game after few years playing it and review the system of the game. Hope this review helps some of u guys.. Thanks.","February 14, 2015","false","092.1"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

I have played this game since early 2000's off and on till now and this game hasnt lost a single bit of its charm. The community is kind competetive and engaging they like to help new players get started out on their fresh new adventures.\n\nThis game is free to play from every aspect and they even help new players withan academy the game text is sometimes translated poorly but i think its comical sometimes. You can understand what the point is. The artwork is amazing! I love the little character sprites so much. The graphics are cute and charming and have aged exceedingly well.\n\nOn a Side Note the Customer Service is top notch I had several issues with witch were dealt with the same night of submitting a ticket! most major gamwes require 48 hours for a response I was Highly impressed to say the least.\n\nA Game this small deserves a chance, If you enjoy the classes and wrecking massive MVP's or slaying giant groups with devastating spells then this game is for you!","February 1, 2015","true","43.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some of it's nostalgia for me, but the game definitely has a lot going for it.\n\nPros:\n-The skill trees and class system are hard to beat\n-Cute art and a decent amount of items and whatnot to personalize your character (Though most of it is headgear)\n-The music is beyond phenomenal\n-It's been around for a long time and still gets content updates.\n-Some of the newer updates have been to make the game more user-friendly and easily accessible to newer players, such as an in-game navigation/search function for NPCs/Zones/Mobs, an in-game map with general level guides for each zone, and an amazing quest setup to make levelling worlds easier.\n-Events!  Loads of events, including monthly dungeons getting double exp/drops, Lunar Festival celebrations, and other holidays!\n-Rich, vibrant community\n-Game's so old, you could run it on a Windows 98 machine (I did)\n\nCons:\n-Combat is very simplistic, based around a point and click system (Think Diablo 2)\n-The grind is real.  Killing monsters, expect to be happy if a monster gives .04% exp.  (Update!  The exp grind is much better!  Monsters *seem* to give more exp, especially in double exp dungeons)\n-Droprates are similarly bad.  There's a lot of headgear customization and cool items and whatnot, but most of the items of note are at 0.01% doprate or less, including ones from rarer, MVP monsters that require groups and coordination for a handful of drops.\n-The game is basically running dungeons and collecting hats.  There's more to it, but it's almost like garnishing.\n-No Auction House, and an entire Merchant Class dedicated to buying and selling items.\n-Very defined class roles (Don't expect Support classes to be able to solo).\n\nNow, the cons seem to outnumber the pros on this, but let me break down some of them, starting towards the bottom.\n\nIn regards to MVPs, there are items called Dead Branches which spawn a random monster.  They *can* be MVPs, but they can be any monster in the game.  There are Bloody Branches which, I dunno how to get them on official servers but, are always MVPs (no guarantee if it's the one you want).  The game relies heavily on casting lots and hoping the RNG gods favor you this day.\n\nIn regards to the Merchant Class (And I apologize for the big shpiel here), it's heavily support in its first form.  But the way the class tree works is, everyone starts as a Novice and at Job level 10 (Normally your base level is around 6 by then), you can switch to your first job, of which there are 6.  Then, when you reach level 40 at a minimum, you can upgrade to your second class (Each of the base jobs branches off into two separate paths).  Every Job level, however, you get a Skill point to spend, so it's highly adviseable to go to job level 50 (max in most cases) to squeeze out all the skill points you can.  Merchants upgrade into Blacksmiths, which can make weapons for folks.  And that's great!  Incredibly profitable, and very useful, as they can be a stopgap for those super high-end dropped weapons, PLUS they can be made elemental to take advantage of weaknesses and allow you to hit ghost property enemies.  OR, Blacksmiths can focus their stats on damage, and be a devastating damage dealer.  There's also Alchemist in the other branch, which is a pretty decent damage dealer too.  So there's light at the end of the tunnel for this support class.  Other ones?  Not necessarily.  Most of them are incredibly group reliant.\n\nBeing group reliant isn't so bad, though!  Because the community's pretty awesome, on the whole.  Sure, there are bad eggs, but you'll find them in any game (plus you're likely to find a bunch of friendly folks here).\n\nNot having an Auction House lets you set whatever price you want, but people have to manually find your store you've set up with your character, and hopefully buy at your prices.  You have to be logged in the whole time for that, as well, and ONLY Merchant class characters (or above) can set up a stall.\n\nAlso, when it comes to stats for characters, you get to completely decide them for yourself!  Which is good and bad, since it's really difficult to reset your stats.  I would advise finding a guide on the character you want to play, and how you want to play it, because you *could* make a high evasion/max attack speed Paladin, but it really wouldn't suit... anyone's needs well.\n\nThere's the RL money component of the game, but this game is far from P2W.  There are a few incredibly useful things in the store, but you can get almost all of them in-game, or from other players.\n\nIf those cons don't sound off-putting, I'd highly recommend giving it a try.  What do you have to lose?  It's fast, it's easy, it's free, much like pouring river water on your socks (But much more rewarding).","January 15, 2015","true","84.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hate saying this seeing as I would very much like to see this game get support all these years later but Privet servers are where you need to be to fully enjoy the emersion of Ragnarok.\nI've spent countless hours in heRO, TalonRO, as well as dozens of higher rate servers such as GarmRO, ScytheRO, FrosakenRO, DreamerRO, and so on. Ive even been a GM and Event GM in privent servers, ive seen it all. In my mind no game will ever come close to being as indepth and fun as Ragnarok, but sadly new players will never feel the same way. If you guys really want to get into RO, go with TalonRO privet server.

The highest character classes during those times were the Priest, Knight, Wizard, Merchant, and Hunter classes. I took a long break from playing due to my studies at school.\n\nThis is based on Norse mythology and on the manhwa title "Ragnarok" by Lee Myun-Jin. Sadly, the manhwa was left unfinished but the game goes on.\n\nCharacter designs are 2D but in a sort of 3D environment.\nThe game itself will run even on a "normal" or non-gaming GPU.\nOST is great to hear.\nThe quest stories are great if you read those dialogs.\n\nAs with other online games, there are bots that farms for items but the game masters are doing whatever they can to reduce the impact on legitimate players leveling up their characters. There is no in-game advertising from other companies except by those bots that sells in-game currency in exchange for real money (scam). That practice is illegal though and if a player is found to be involved in that transaction. Then, character ban will result and sometimes character and items deletion.\n\nJust don't do something illegal in-game and this will be a good game. Lots of grinding if you go solo.

It's messy, outdated, unpolished, broken, and the economy has been absolutely CRUSHED by bots, which now likely outnumber players 8 to 1. And yet there is no other game in the world like it! I've gone back to this game more times that I care to confess, and it's because of just how damn unique it is.\n\nOn paper, this game is outstanding! There's a crazy amount of content, the branching class system is unmatched, the specs each class can follow are wonderfully diverse, the soundtrack is whimsical, and everything about it is so damn enchanting!\n\nBut then you find out everything costs a billion zeny, high level players troll outside of major cities to unleash boss monsters that kill everyone on the map, the UI is horribly outdated, there's no direction or guidance in the game, not every class spec is good or even viable, most classes need to follow very specific online builds to be good, and there are basically only 2 or 3 classes fit for PvP. Once upon a time, grinding was one of the absolute worst parts of the game. It would take actual months of straight grinding enemies just to level up once. One death costs you 1% of your experience, 5 months or more wasted, once you reached the mid 90s.\n\nThankfully, that much has been fixed! Getting to level 40 alone may take you just a few days and its much less stressful. And while the game is still a broken mess, laggy as all hell, and outdated by over a decade, you may still find this game as enthralling as I have. The community is great, as well. There's an unbelievably vast number of online resources, from guides to metadata about every area, item, and monster--mostly due to the game data being cracked really early on, everything about the game is now available everywhere online! It's at least worth a run through level 40. And bring friends! Nothing livens up a busted system like a bunch of comrades to laugh and play with.\n\nThere really is no other game in the world remotely like Ragnarok Online~","November 1, 2013","true","250.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I hate saying this seeing as I would very much like to see this game get support all these years later but Privet servers are where you need to be to fully enjoy the emersion of Ragnarok.\nI've spent countless hours in heRO, TalonRO, as well as dozens of higher rate servers such as GarmRO, ScytheRO, FrosakenRO, DreamerRO, and so on. Ive even been a GM and Event GM in privent servers, ive seen it all. In my mind no game will ever come close to being as indepth and fun as Ragnarok, but sadly new players will never feel the same way.

Simple enough to get on and make great progress in a few minutes and yet complex enough that there is allways more you can do, these combine to make playing the game for hours very easy. The older sprite-style design of the characters, monsters and gameplay also seem to add to the game letting the player know they are being lost in their word of fantasy, which can be lost on the graphics we have today, which make everything seem so realistic that we can't seperate them from our average boring world. I am not so far in the story at this point that I feel any compliment I could make would do it justice but what I have experienced so far has allowed me enough room to say that it is a fantasy epic that could rival those of Final Fantasy and Star Ocean. I know that I will be enjoying my adventrues with my little poring for hours to come with this game, that is if my friends don't kill me first for talking endlessly about the game.\nI give it a four out of five for gemplay and enjoyability, and a five for the graphics for the unique way they bring the user to a new life.

To be completely honest, I, taken by nostalgia, wanted to try out RO again solely because I wanted to relive the past. This may sound hypocritical because I'm trying to brag about how great this game is, but RO isn't very exciting compared to all of today's great games. It was the greatest thing in the world 10 years ago, but not the greatest anymore. However, it's not terrible and for veterans it brings a tear to one's eye to hear the old theme song of the capital city playing in the background.\n\nI tried out RO 2 first because I wanted to see what changes were made. To my disappointment some of the game mechanics in RO 2, which worked well for RO, didn't really transition well. So I thought "oh well" and moved onto to RO. It took a little grinding to get started, but I fairly enjoyed it. Some people might find grinding miserable, but after playing years of fast paced games it was suprisingly enjoyable to slow down a bit. The graphics are 2D/3D...and of course it's crap since it was made 10 years ago. (but it was some really great crap back then) The controls consist of the function keys, alt+(letter keys) and just clicking. Moving and attacking are clicking/clicking+holding. Hotkeys are function keys. Very simple~ but it worked fabulously.\n\nThe training grounds gave me a bit of a refresher on all the little details and it's a good place to start out as a beginner if you don't know anything at all. This is great because RO can be a bit complicated even for veterans. There are a bunch of requirements you have to meet for certain things and stats you have build on for certain jobs. You might hate tutorials, but trust me... you'll need all the free items, easy levels, and explanations as possible or the beginner stages will be slow and painful. I can't critique on the rest of the game since I haven't gotten too much into it myself, but if memory serves me right this game was well worth my time. Once you make some friends or get into a guild the game will be a little easier to understand and you'll start to play strategically (or not...I prefer strategy). It's a lot more fun to play in parties (especially with experienced players that don't do all the work, but assist the little guys) vs clicking on a bunch of monsters...alone... for hours. Since your characters don't "dodge" (they stand still and exchange blows with the monster you're locked on) the most you can get out of solo playing is really just standing still and hitting monsters. The beauty of rpg's is to figure out (for example) who's going to tank, who's going to heal, who's going to range, etc. And seriously it's going to suck if you solo...\n\nA little tangent here- I loved how the game gave the option of playing the classic RO vs the updated one. When I played in the newer one I couldn't help feel like a total noob because maps were different and monsters had changed levels/locations. The classic RO option let me get used to the game and relive those younger days :D\n\nIf you're looking for high end graphics and fast paced gaming... this is not for you. If you're looking to get into an old mmorpg because you want a change of pace, go ahead. If you're a veteran of the game and you haven't played in a while just try it out for a bit. I'm not asking you to commit. It's really hard to start from square one, but playing it once in a while still feels great and you might be able to get serious about it later.","February 26, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamKMEO/recommended/215100/","IamKMEO","KMEO5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IamKMEO/","84 products in account","Don't let the low play time fool you. I've played this game wayyyyyyyyy before I DL'd this on steam and I've got two level 150 toons (Warlock & Ranger) that are very geared, three others in their third  jobs (Arch Bishop, Mechanic, & Rune Knight) with one going to its third job (Champion going Sura), and two toons ready to transcend (Assassin -> High Thief -> Assassin Cross & Crusader -> High Swordman -> Paladin).\n\nFirst off, I'd like to say that Ragnarok Online was one of the first MMOs I played as a kid and I really enjoyed the hell out of this game, back then. I played this game in its prime when a lot of people used to play this game. Every screen in PC-bangs were all just covered with RO. I wish this game were as popular as it was then, but sadly, the appeal to this type of game is, sadly, a niche. Far superior games (e.g. WoW) have taken over many of its player base and it is sad to see it dwindle. In addition to people jumping ship to other games, one of the most off-putting thing about this game is purchasable gear. This game has turned into a pay-to-win game and it's really sad that it's going in that direction. There is also a bot problem in this game that many people hate, but I tend to side with the bots; sure, it saturates the market with cheap items, which in turn makes it difficult to earn "easy" money, but it also provides cheap supplies and it frees you up in doing things you want to do than mindlessly killing low level monster just to get a chance drop of some item. Another problem with the game many people, including me, find very frustrating: the game is RIDDLED with MVP cards and God items that are WAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too overpowered in PvP settings; it's cool to use it in PvE because this game is just a total grindfest, but in PvP (at least not for WoE), it should seriously be disabled. Getting lucky in this game, or just having a boatload of real money to buy gear, is really taking out the skill aspect in this game; all someone or some guild has to do is roll into your castle with MVP Cards and God items, and all your hardwork turns into a loss. Yes, it's not easy to get these items, but why put it in the first place to give people an unfair advantage over others? There's a huge item gap in this game and the devs should do something to even-out the playing field. Oh, and another thing: this game expects you to know what you're doing. Every. Damn. Time. Like, I literally think some people, whom had no lives, managed to figure out what to do because they just kept clicking on stuff and accidentally "figured out" what to do. One of which is the Rachel Access Quest... HOW DO THEY EXPECT YOU TO KNOW THAT????????? There are many other glaring issues (e.g. rubberbanding & some other gameplay mechanics), but I don't want to list them all.\n\nI separated this from the rest because it's not too much of a problem, but the game is plastered with bad grammar, spelling, and lack of punctuation; I'm not the greatest when it comes to the English language, but I'd seriously go over every single dialogue there is in RO to make it better (of course, they'd have to pay me to do it). They should've seriously hired an English major to write the script and dialogue for the game because it's unprofessional and it really breaks immersion, and I start to lose interest in the story line (if there's even any to begin with) reading broken English. Yes, I know it's an pretty old game, but it doesn't hurt to fix some of those very old mistakes.\n\nI'd really like to recommend this game to bring in new players and veterans alike, and to see it shine in its former glory, but it's proving too difficult to do so with the things I find, and I'm certain many current and ex-players would agree as well, that are too problematic.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I really love this game. Heck, it was part of my childhood! I might even play it soon because of the amount of nostalgia I have for this game. However, until they resolve some of these issues, I really can't recommend this game to other players. If this niche suits you, then by all means, go play the hell out of it!","January 27, 2015","false","60.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well,you always can kill time with this game and its a lot less boring if you playing with your old friends(probably reminded to the poop hat in this game while taking dump,and suddenly decided to play RO1 again!).","May 14, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was initially hooked onto this game with its branching job system and PVP, but in order to get to the good stuff you have to trudge through all the bad stuff.  When I first logged in there was an options screen, for the sound there was an ON tickbox. Naturally, I ignored it since the UI was poorly designed and hasn't aged well. So I made a character and ended up in the tutorial. The first thing I noticed was that text in the game was terrible. The devs basically put the whole Korean game into Google Translate, hit translate and bam, didn't bother editing. The graphics are fine, I have no problem with they have aged well. However, the controls for movement are terrible, movement is tile based so you have to click to a tile and you can't click rapidly like in an ARPG. Also instead of the sound being turned on default, you have to turn it on yourself. Basic MMORPG features are missing from this game and the minimap is terrible. If you want me to keep playing this game, I should be able to understand it properly and it should be presented well. Fix the UI and don't run your whole game through Google Translate please.","April 21, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This version of the game plays like it's been updated with a lot of MMORPG standards like questing and a navagation arrow.\n\nThe graphics are what they have been and these days tend to show it's age quite a bit. If one of your top priorities is graphics over gameplay then this game is NOT for you. The controls while simple enough for a MMO which is to say movement is based on point to a location click and go. Can and do feel delayed at times and if that wasn't bad enough lag issues don't help.\n\nThe ever present action hotbar is here as well but in all fairness by this point in a MMO that goes without saying. and each character has skills that where made to feel unique to that class. but with that there are ways to somewhat circemvent that limitation since some items grant use of other classes skills.\n\nCombat for the most part is just as simple as navagation. point and click on moster and your character does their basic attack you can use skills in a similer fashion. use the action hotbar button for the skill you want then point and click on the monster. The combat does get repetitive and feels grindy at times but you may find yourself in a sort of trance after a bit and when you snap out of it you will realize that you have been mindlessly killing for hours and have rocketed up several levels for your effort. And if that doesn't help this game comes with the standard F2P cash shop though if your expecting a P2W mentality then you will be somewhat happy to hear that for the most part it doesn't appear that's the case here.\n\nOverall this game will bring back memories for a lot of people. good bad and ugly ones. and while this may be my first time with the "official" version of the game. i have been playing this game for years and still find it fun to play on occasion. My recomandation is that you try it out since free 2 play you don't have anything to lose other then time.","February 19, 2015","true","29.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game was a masterpiece, the classes are amazing and fun to play as. I play with a Lord Knight as my main, and a ninja as my alt. The games population is still surprisingly high reason why I say this is because the games old and its been out since 2002. So much like really good and old mmorpgs(Ever quest) they slowly died off. I enjoy this game and I would gladly keep coming back to it.\n\nPros-amazing class system, huge world to explore, fun culinary system, a nice pet taming system, and a loyale and dedicated fan base.\n\nCons-Bots i think(ive talked to people who say there arent any), and some server lag but i havent experienced any.","August 12, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Truly surpassed all its competitors back then.\n\nOver ten years later, I still feel the same way. It's still the most entertaining to me and its sequel, while possibly enjoyable, truly sucked in comparison to the original when I played it. Disregarding gameplay, RO is a game that will never expire: its art style with beautiful sprites is still fantastic and its environments while dated are done just well enough that they hold up well from the angle you play the game at.\n\nMany hours were burned through with this game and having not played it in two years, I'm sure many more will be, this time on Steam. Even after the game went free to play, it maintened everything that made it great. It's gone through so many changes but its core is still the same, and I can't recommend it enough to someone who wants to play a MMO that's satisfying and not completely generic.","July 8, 2014","true","127.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a beautiful game with lush environments and colorful sprites and monsters.  However, it gets repetitive and boring when you start leveling up in hours instead of minutes and the charm wears off.  For a purely casual RPG gamer side step this one.  This is also not a game you can play on your own which is bad for a solo player like me.  You will need friends or join a guild or you will never see all of the game's content.  To it's credit the combat is solid and the skill trees are good and leveling is satisfying.  I did though spend a lot of time trying to close out a dozen hot-key bars I accidentally opened.  All 100 different maps, charts, bars, screens have a macro to turn them on and off in your display and each one is explained briefly and only once in the 2+ hour tutorial section and good luck figuring out how to close them.   If you can spare the time to grind all the way to 100 twice, create another character to craft all your gear and potions, farm for card drops for weeks, and turn Ragnarok into essentially a full time job then go for it.  I am already tired of it and I'm not even level 30 so there's no way I have the patience for that.","January 30","false","29.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"

Your character struggles as he is pushed into the centre of a war wherein he spends half his time lying on his back with the title 'Return to last save point' above his aggrivated corpse, the words 'skill has failed' echoing through his mind.\n\nYour hero will meet many others on his journey whom he talks to and will immediately vanish upon mention of the word 'bot', 'report' or 'god-poing.' The many NPC's you meet will likely ask you to fetch several hundred incredibly rare items for incredible equipment that will offer a massive increase of 1 to your agility (wow!) or maybe even 2! (but not without minusing 20 off your vitality).\n\nThe many incredible monsters and foes will fall before our hero's hundreds of many carefully-saved potions from his alt merchant whom has the 'discount' skill and is actually able to afford basic necessities for stepping more than two meters outside of town! Provided that he saves up for a few days..\n\nOur great hero will be rewarded from these great enemies with clovers, feathers and an incredible 0.05% increase to his next level! That means he only has to kill one thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine more monsters to advance to level 2!\n\nYou'll say "Wow!" you'll say "Oh!" you'll say "Please end the maddening terror that is my life!"

If they could just fixed the server then this game would be the best!. Its a really fun game if your willing to play it 7/10.\n\nAfter a year:\nThis regard everything i said before, IRO has started for more than 5 years, and still no progress with anything that i wanted them to change. Im not sure whetever the problems is on not improving the lags and bots. But if they can't fix it, why even bother giving this a good review?\nThey probably wont fix any of that problem so im change my review into bad review and a rating out of 4/10.
