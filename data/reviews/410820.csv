"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/410820/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I've mentioned this before, but I'm glad Arcen Games exists, even if I don't really enjoy most of their games. Every one of their titles tends to venture beyond the normal bounds of game design, mashing such disparate concepts as open worlds, puzzles, and zombies into a single title. Starward Rogue has earned the distinction of their most enjoyable game for me, perhaps because it doesn't go as far afield in design as the rest.\n\nStarward Rogue places you in a head attached to a robot body, stomping around the Megalith, a giant construct sticking out of a star. You get to pick one of six bodies, and they vary wildly, from close-combat flame-spewers to a clever thing that freezes time when you're not moving. According to the tutorial you're here to rescue some AI dude, but that never really comes up during runs. Each run is a top-down descent through five randomly-generated levels, featuring rooms of all shapes and sizes. Armed with your gun, missiles, energy cannon, and whatever upgrades and single-use items you can find, you have to blast your way through tons of enemies, bosses, and minibosses to... win, I suppose. I've beaten it once and you just get a stat screen.\n\nIf this all sounds a lot like Binding of Isaac, that's because this is its manic sci-fi cousin. Your enemies are colorful drones and ships that will sling thousands of bullets at you in every configuration imaginable. Much like the Touhou shmup games, bullets can curve, seek, chain, turn at right angles, form walls or fields or mazes, or perform even more dastardly manuevers. Be prepared to do a lot of complex dodging and narrow escapes to survive a run. The health system is luckily quite generous, giving you a pool of health you can easily upgrade, but also a shield or two (much harder to upgrade) that recharges for every room, like a free hit. You also move quite fast and can freely sprint, which is a welcome addition and gives the game a much quicker pace than most.\n\nAside from the coins and keys you'll pick up, there are three classes of weapons, passive upgrades, and consumables to find. Weapons tend to be few and far between but will completely change your style of play. Some guns fire through walls, some spread like flamethrowers, and some only work in melee range. Consumables can have similarly dramatic effects, like summoning temporary helpers and nuking everything in sight. You'll also level up and earn perks, but until level 10 or so those perks won't be very conspicuous, mostly being health or ammo upgrades. Oh, and there are permanent drone buddies you can find that provide some much-needed support, but can be easily confused with your foes.\n\nAnd that brings me to my one real gripe with the game, the art style. Arcen tends to favor very bold, brash color schemes for their games, but too much variety in the palette can make important features hard to single out. Everything in Starward Rogue is brightly colored and detailed, but there's no real theme to the enemies, helpers, or even you. In huge battles everything can start to blend together, even moreso with thousands of glowing bullets flying around. The camera and the pace of your robot help keep it distinctive, but I've started skipping the drone familiars because they almost always confuse me and get me killed.\n\nThe art style may be hit or miss, but the rest of the presentation is excellent. Arcen games often have somewhat shoddy menus and interfaces, but the ones here are clear and even a bit polished. All the information you need is readily available and easily navigable. There's a little jank to some of the room transitions, and I thought the tutorial was bugged because the text popups are location-specific so you can blink and miss them, but those were the only two polish complaints.\n\nWhat really keeps me coming back is just how plain ol' fun it is. The raw enjoyment of blasting hundreds of robots as you grow stronger and more unstoppable is in full force here. A pumping soundtrack helps keep you moving at breakneck speed as you look for the next boss to thrash. The difficulty is pretty even-handed as well, with only the final boss giving me any real trouble. With hundreds of enemies to encounter, tons of items to find, six classes to master, and plenty of secrets to uncover, Starward Rogue is a worthy competitor in the arena of roguelike shooters.","January 29","true","7.7"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","52","57","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdentityNon/recommended/410820/","IdentityNon","TRU±Identity","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IdentityNon/","287 products in account","Key supplied by developer for review.\n======================================Starward Rogue (Read on for the full review!)\n======================================\nTL;DR:I'm going to assume Starward Rogue is the first bullethell roguelite mashup, but if not, I bet it's the first that will be a success! Satisfying gameplay, nostalgic but qualitative art and sound, numerous progression and playstyle options, and highly configurable controls lead me to believe 100% that this will do the same for the rogue genre as Necrodancer, but with bullethell.\n\n======================================\nPros:+ Addiction: This would be a major hit in the arcade era, but thanks to the PC, I can keep my quarters...and house!\n+ Graphics: You can see space through the floors. Nuff said.\n+ Audio: Great music, variety of satisfying SFX.\n+ Bullets: A total of over 100 enemies with a large variety of bullet patterns and colors.\n+ Controls: Fairly extensive customization.\n+ Variety: Tons of mechs, enemies, powerups, weapons, modules, and consumables.\n+ Gameplay: It's downright fun and satisfying to have bullet hell, action RPG, and rogue elements deftly interwoven.\n+ Dynamic: Multiple difficulty options, risk vs. reward upgrades, and mechs can provide engaging differences in gameplay, feel, and challenge. There's even a mech that stops time when you aren't moving; great for many reasons.\n+ Romance: It's so much cheaper than real fireworks!\n\nCons:- Defeat: As with any roguelike/roguelite, after getting far, death can take the wind out of your sails. There's something wholly unpleasant about slowly gaining power, overcoming odds, skillfully besting pure chaos--and then getting sent back to what now feels like baby's first dungeon. Solutions:\n- Gametypes: I'd love to see an arena or endless mode, preferably with player-triggered waves, the ability to select or unlock items for starting loadout, and the ability to skip to a certain wave.\n- Gametypes Pt 2: No boss attack mode?\n- I'm bad at bullet hell games.\n\nNeutral:± Graphics: I don't like the green floor type at all. Preference.\n\n======================================\nIntroduction:Welcome to my review of Starward Rogue, an unapolagetic bullethell roguelite fusion. As with any rogue, most of this is going to come down to gameplay, so let's just move on immediately!\n\nGameplay:Upon starting up a new save file for Starward Rogue, you will find yourself in a quick voiced tutorial that covers the basics and then sends you on your way. There are slow, default, and sprint movement speeds. Slow and normal speeds will be used to navigate mazes of bullets and traps carefully, while sprint is good for dodging quick enemies and bullets, as well as backtracking. You have your primary and secondary weaponfire, modules that can alter any number of things, and consumables that can also have a large variety of effects. The tutorial will also get you started on your way to recognizing enemy types and the way their bullet patterns work, as well as how a room might generate and how that will change the dynamics of combat based on their structure. There are traps and obstacles aplenty.\n\nWhen looking at the stats screen pertaining to your save file, you can see that there is a total of: 124 enemies, 8 minibosses, 20 bosses, 13 condemned enemies, 223 items, and 11 incredibilities. Upon beating (as of the latest update) three 5-floor runs, you will unlock 7-floor runs. This is a downright impressive quantity for any game to feature, and yet the enemy types and bosses all seem balanced, weapons and items all seem to have their pros, cons, and uses, and you have 6 different options for what type of mech you wish to tackle it all with. The level of variety these possibilities produce, combined with the recognizable patterns and attack types of enemies, makes for a fun and challenging but fair experience. If that isn't the case for you, though, there are also 5 difficulty options to suit your needs! I should also mention that there are level-up perks, as well as health, currency, ammo, and exp drops. Even further, if you pick up a different weapon, consumable, or module it will swap their locations instead of overwrite the old with the new. Try something out for a few rooms and don't like it? You can just go back.\n\nAfter 15 runs, I am at a measly 18% completion, and am still discovering interesting new room and floor layouts that catch me off guard. There are tiles you can't walk on, bombs you can't touch, barriers you can't pass, a variety of barriers that you or your enemies can still shoot past, timed and infinite lazers, turrets with various behaviors, etc. When you throw all of these into a room, of varying size and shape, in various formations, and then mix in a multitude of enemies with various attack patterns--some of which might make dodging impossible when combined, and stir it all up--you're in for a hectic, chaotic, fun-filled time! Thankfully, for scrubs like me, in a lot of situations simply taking cover between assaults is an option.\n\nEven with death's strong attraction to me, I find myself compelled to deftly navigate the pretty, colorful volley of fireworks that are my enemy's bullets and laugh maniacally when they die with a satisfying explosion. Starward Rogue has a great concept and execution, and is just good old plain fun. With the right combination of hull, primary and secondary weapon, module, level-up perks, and upgrades I firmly believe that you will have an adrenaline-filled journey where you make a stupid mistake, die, curse the heavens, and then feel all the more eager to become similarly powerful and vanquish your enemies!\n\nGraphics:Here are the highlights: the main menu background art, beautiful. The interface, suitable and thematic, if a bit blue and large; good mix of retro and modern stylings. The textures and level design, fairly good, but not super amazing. I hate the green space background, but I once encountered a pink-yellow-orange background that was gorgeous and gave the game an amazing feel for that run. Super distinct, polished, and shiny would be a fault in this case, anyway, because the most important thing to see are the enemy attacks; displayed here in distinct, vivid colors and patterns. Finally, it is worth noting that the bosses have pretty detailed pixel art that I find lovely.\n\nAudio:Great music, fits nicely, good when playing but can get old fast if you happen to alt tab for something. There are some nice subtle atmospheric sounds, and various other sounds that generally remind me of some of the better oldschool games around. It won't win any sound design of the year awards, but if you are a fan of rogues, sound is not the first thing on your mind.\n\nConclusion:Due to the quality gameplay, strong concept, good execution, massive variety, and an appealing mix of challenge and fairness, I recommend purchasing Starward Rogue at:\n\nFull price. All the time, any time.\n\n======================================No drama, Just Reviews.\n\nIf you like my reviews, you can easily keep up with them here.\n======================================","February 3","true","8.0"," 40 of 45 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","40","45","0","0"

If you don't, this is a great introduction to the rogue-lite genre.\n\nMuch like the aforementioned 2 games, this is a top-down rogue-lite with secrets and rooms of enemies. So what makes this one different?\n\n- More interesting rooms. The rooms in Isaac and Throne are mostly afterthoughts -- simple arenas in which to fight enemies. Here, you generally get far more interesting patterns.\n- More bullet hell. The other games take inspiration from the SHMUP genre, but they're too afraid to go all the way, preferring enemies that charge at you and simple bullets. Starward Rogue goes full SHMUP, with really cool bullet patterns that make dodging a real challenge. Think the Hush from Rebirth, but without the crazy HP.\n- Cool sci-fi feel. This genre was really missing a true sci-fi setting, and this is it.\n- Excellent *hi-res* art. Isn't it about time we got good art in rogue-lites? Why do they all want to use low-res art? The art here is beautiful and detailed. Each bullet glows with energy, and the explosions are satisfying.\n- Explosions. Awesome explosions everywhere!\n- Crazy good music. Seriously, just listen to the trailer.\n- Easy to mod. Remember how Rebirth needed forever to give us modding tools? Well Starward Rogue has them out *now*. Make good enough rooms/enemies, and Arcen will even put them in the official game. How cool is that?\n\nWhat I would like to see:\n- A daily run. This has become standard among rogue-lites.\n- Some co-op action, even if it's local only.\n- Networking co-op would be even better.\n\nAll in all, I highly recommend this game.","January 23","true","27.1"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/recommended/410820/","SamuraiVader","Samurai Vader","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SamuraiVader/","4009 products in account","Starward Rogue is a roguelite/bullet hell game made by experienced indie studio Arcen Games, previously known for games like AI War or Bionic Dues. Developers obviously favor the sci-fi theme so Starward Rogue is no exception. You'll control a mech that will venture into "The Megalith" to destroy every threat on sight.\n\nTo do that important task, you'll be assigned with many weapons. From the start you'll get a basic rifle, energy rifle (with limited energy for every room) and missile launcher. That doesn't mean you'll keep those through your run, as you'll be finding many great weapons and tools (some apply as a permanent passive bonus, others are only for one use).\n\nBefore you start, you'll select a mech that you want - if you don't like the basic one, you can pick a mech that focuses on treasure hunting, or a mech that can manipulate time (in a Superhot style), for example. Don't worry, there are even more unique mechs for you to pick, providing more variability for your runs, which is necessary for every roguelike/roguelite game.\n\nVariability of runs is also high because of two important things: There are many room patterns that can surprise even experienced players, and every enemy has a unique way of attacking. Every type of enemy has a different way to turn your run to inevitable end. This fact made me really excited for more runs, seeing the awesome developers' creativity for bullets and attacks. This applies also for bosses and though there aren't many of those, they still offer a great bullet hell experience.\n\nBesides of health (and shield), you'll be also taking care of money that will drop from several objects in the rooms, and shopping - you can spend your money for bot helpers, new weapons, upgrades, heals or experience. Starward Rogue follows classic leveling system, where every level up offers you a special passive upgrade (you pick one from three possible upgrades). Through the levels, you'll be also collecting a health shards that can upgrade your maximum health.\n\nFrom the presentation point of view, the visual style of the game feels pleasant in terms of the sci-fi theme. That applies also for the soundtrack, which belongs into electronic/dubstep genre and though I don't listen to that music genre, it felt fine there.\n\nTo make it a great experience for both newbies and skilled players, Starward Rogue has five difficulty options. Unlocking achievements tends to be really satisfying, as developers made them only for challenges that truly tests your skill... to a certain extent, since you can unlock them even on the easy difficulty (but I guess that might even make 100% achievement hunters happy).\n\nDevelopers definitely deserve praise for this game, which they even continually update with new content and bugfixes. They also support mod creators, with their active Arcen Games forum community and detailed documentation on wiki.\n\nConclusion:Starward Rogue is a great case of using currently popular roguelite and twin stick shooter formulas into developers' favoured futuristic theme. With continued support, great room, weapon, item and enemy variety, there aren't feature that would deserve a negative critic. I can recommend this game with a clear conscience. Great game!\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Starward Rogue was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 27","true","9.1"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

You know, like Nuclear Throne and such, except with a lot more bullets. Very much recommended.\n\nI didn't have many expectations for this game. Lack of personal exposure to  games like this and Arcen's history of mostly making slower paced games made me wonder it it'll end up being any good. I'm glad to say I was wrong. Starward Rogue is a solid "roguelite" shooter with a varied selection of mechs to start with, plenty of powerful-feeling weapons, interesting enemy attack patterns (which there are a lot of) and nail-biting bossfights.\n\nIt's also hard. Sure, there's easy and very easy below normal difficulty but my pride won't allow me to use them. There's often very little room between all the bullets to navigate through and at least for me a good early run means I get overconfident and get smacked down hard before reaching the fifth level boss. Things are mostly manageable on normal but when kicking it up a notch to hard, the bullet hell part becomes quite obvious. To my  knowledge Misery difficulty bullet patterns didn't quite make it to 1.0 so it remains to be seen what kind of masochistic hell that ends up becoming.\n\nOverall I was positively surprised how good it turned out to be and it'll probably become my go-to game when I don't have all evening to spend on gaming. I'll probably gift it to a friend too since the price is reasonable and I myself got it for free.\n\n9/10\nOne point off for unfinished Misery difficulty and some confusing UI stuff, both of which will end up being sorted out once more player feedback gets to the developers.","January 22","true","16.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

It has different difficulties to appeal for everyone, I've never played this type of game and easy was well... a tad easy (there's also Very Easy.) Normal so far is pretty challenging but I'm slowly making it further and further with each successive run. Bosses are fun and each one is unique. Depending on how intense you want it you can change the difficulty accordingly, but it does seem each difficulty is a fair amount harder then the previous one (with a total of 5 difficulties atm.)\n\nSo far the game seems like it has a lot of replayability and this would be the perfect type of game to let some hours slip by without you even realizing it or just to do one playthrough, or even just a floor or a room. It's very friendly in that you have plenty of opportunities to jump in and out inbetween combat (I haven't tried doing that in combat yet.)\n\nThe Game starts off with 5 levels but you can unlock two more levels (I haven't done that yet so idk how it's done but from the impression I got you just have to beat the game a couple times.) The Graphics are good and it's easy to distinguish between the background and the neon bullets so that isn't a concern.\n\nStarward Rogue was made by Arcen and all the games I've played by them have been supported well after launch. The Devs are pretty active on their forums (Arcengames.com) so you can stop by their for questions or to chat.  The music was produced by the same person who produces all of Arcens games and it fits extremely well in here imo.\n\nLastly according to some people this feels like a really good Binding of Issac clone (again I haven't played the genre so I haven't played it) so if you like that game you'll probably like this one as a refreshing breather at the minimum.","January 22","true","11.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

They always create unique experiences that are hard - sometimes impossible - to find elsewhere.  Starward Rogue is no exception.  It's an action rogue-like with bullet hell influences.  You have 6 mechs to choose from, each with different stats.  During your game, you'll encounter tons of perks, equipment, and weapons to aid, or sometimes hinder, your quest.  There are bosses, enemies, and items to unlock on multiple playthroughs.  You'll fight through 5 pseudo randomly generated levels, each ending in a boss fight.  A single run should take around 30 minutes to an hour to complete, depending on your play-style and difficulty.  If you find it too easy or too hard, there are 5 difficulty levels to choose from.  Both keyboard/mouse and gamepad are equally playable.  All of the keys are rebindable, so it should be trivial to suit the controls to your taste.

Seriously.\n\n---\n\nWhile Arcen Games business model may be struggling, you wouldn't know it from their latest release - Starward Rogue. This roguelite is very much in the same vein as the mammoth twin-stick shooter The Binding of Isaac in the sense that its a top-down shooter with heavy emphasis on upgrades and knowledge of the system (oh, and with a bit of bullet-hell, too). While Starward Rogue is not without its flaws, it certainly gets alot right.\n\nPros:\n+Its really fun. This game will certainly have you coming back for 'one more level'. Very addicting.\n+While the controller support needs some work in the menus (should be patched any day know as per devs), the in-game controls are really tight. Edit: Its even better playing with keyboard+mouse.\n+Lots of meaningful upgrades that actually make you think functionally about how you play the game. This is heavily inspired from BoI I am sure. Its done well.\n+The setting is cool. There is something quite appealing about the odd situation of the ship stuck in a planet/asteroid.\n+Level design is quite well done. Definately has *some* lite puzzle aspect, and strategy as you go about completing a level.\n+Music is great and high energy.\n\nCons:\n-There are some minor bugs with sound/getting stuck on doorways. All small stuff. AND any crashes I may have had, I was able to reload and it had autosaved, so its all good.\n\n\nThis is a must buy.","January 30","true","25.2"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

Espcially if you've played Binding of Isaac(BoI) or Nuclear Throne(NT).\n\nIf there is one thing I have to give props for Arcen games beyond all else, it has to be consistently making games that feel unique, even in a genre (shump roguelite) that's been getting more and more attention as of late.\n\nIt focuses more on the bullet hell aspect, which is something that I didn't know that I wanted, but was sorely needed.  It does have the same design beats with keys and missiles that essentially act like bombs that can access secret rooms.  And it has NT's perk system when you level up.  Keep in mind though that for better or worse you can't break a run by getting essentially infinite items like in BoI.\n\nThe level design is fairly well done with the battles usually having some twist to them in terms of obstacles and layout.  The background graphics for the game can look a bit busy though, which means that you won't be able to instantly grasp what needs to be done in the room (like dodging spikes for instance).  However, you can easily see the bullets against the background, which has been a problem with some more colorful shmups.\n\nThe music is appropriately techno and fits with the mecha aesthetic.  Other than the menu (where you control the cursor with the control stick), the game works well on a controller, which is a plus.\n\nThere's also future support coming from the company itself.  And there's an active modding community that's been constantly adding more variety to the base game.  All Arcen has to do is to curate it before the created content gets patched in.\n\nSo it's not a clone.  Starward Rogue has its own take while still cherry picking the best of others in the genre.\n\nA solid 8/10 that scratches an itch I've had for a while and a likely candidate for that part in my game library where I never uninstall.","January 28","true","3.3"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

They do Good Things. They do Fun Things.\n\nThey are not a big corporation, and I doubt they ever will be, because they most of all do Unsafe things.\n\nStarward Rogue is, functionally, much like Binding of Isaac; But whereas most games look at Binding of Isaac and say 'Okay, let's basically make it like that', this game took Binding of Isaac far beyond what it should be. The characters are very, very different- One of them even turns the game into a Frozen Synapse-esque strategy, with the action only moving when you do. The controls are crisp and ultra-responsive. Unlike Binding of Isaac, I have never had a moment where I ran into something because the character was moving like they were on a patch of ice- Except for that one game where I picked up the item that specifically makes your sprint movement faster, and slippery. Controls are completely amazing.\n\nThe vast breadth of items and monsters makes the game hugely fun. There are tons of different items, and enemies, and each enemy works in a different way. The roguelike bullet hell is endlessly entertaining, always throwing new challenges at you. Bosses aren't AS varied, but there are twenty of the damn things, each one of which is very unique in its fight style, and insanely fun. The items vary from simple passive boosts to the vast variety of different primary and secondary weapons, which encouage different gameplay styles.\n\nIt's insanely fun. It is definitely worth more than 12 dollars. And Arcen Games needs your help, because they do strange things that don't slot easily into other people's labels.

Like a variegated ballet, you weave through a diversity of bullet patterns and enemy types, clearing rooms and floors as you progress ever deeper into The Monolith. Each time you level up, you select a perk from a given set to customize your mech. Additionally, you find or acquire robot companions, attachments and other bonuses to further mutate the experience. This makes each run slightly different than the last, rewarding flexibility and adaptation.\n\nThere's so much content included with the base game, you'll be finding new items and enemies even after hours of playtime. A great strength of the game is how easily content can be added or modified. In fact, a portion of the included rooms, enemies and bosses were created by community members, vetted by Arcen and released with the game. Arcen has said they intend to release additional content for what is an already content rich game.\n\nEasily worth the asking price and oozing with replayability.

I'd further like to elevate that this little gem comes with a very reasonable pricetag.\n\nLet's start by saying that Starward Rogue is really overwhelming cool!  The bullet patterns are sheer madness and indicate that whosoever did them really did his homework properly and thus developed a unique approach to something well known and liked.\n\nThe coreplay itself is very fast and fluid, a difficulty setting and different types of armor make it very approachable for beginners and long-term-fans to the genre as well. The vast amount of different weapon, perk and skill combinations make it become a decent overall gaming experience that due to it's clever but simple design comes with tons of replay value.\n\nA great plus is that some of the actual game content is inspired by it's community.

You are a disembodied head, and your sole use to is to control these mechanized warriors. You are replaceable, you are not someone special, you're just a cog in the machine that allows it's usage. The game reiterates this many times that it doesn't matter if you die because they can just replace you. You're a genetically modified space dragon that can regrow it's head upon death after a certain amount of time. You and many others in a similar situation to you are aboard the Megalith which is a giant ship in space that is lodged into a star, and your 'masters' have been paid handsomely to rescue Rodney from his metallic space cell. It is up to one of you to traverse the ship, combat it's many enemies, traps and hidden rooms in hopes of finding Rodney and maybe get yourself out of this hellhole. Is there any better motivation than that?\n\nThe tutorial is entertaining and short enough to keep you entertained while subtly showing you what to expect from a gameplay perspective. There are simple traps, revolving guns, and one special enemy which gives you a true glimpse of the future horrors to come. The game feels natural with a controller and the controls feels intuitive, very typical of twinstick shooters you control the direction of where you shoot with the right thumbstick and move with the left. You also have other weapons depending on the mech you choose, the standard mech has a gun that shoots infinite bullets, a rocket launcher and an energy weapon both with limited ammo. The energy weapon fully restocks after each new room you enter so it's a great wave clearer when you're overwhelmed by enemies. Once you finally clear the tutorial, you can pick a character to choose who you want to traverse the Megalith with.\n\nThere are 6 different mechs to choose from, all with their own strengths and weaknesses that will directly cater to almost any playstyle. There are also 5 difficulties to choose from, ranging from Very Easy to 'Misery' which hasn't been fully implemented yet but aspires to be Touhou levels of hard once it's finished. For my first run I decided to go with Normal which describes itself as meant for people who are experienced with SHMUPS or roguelikes. I'm fairly well acquainted with the genre with over 100 hours in Nuclear Throne, a game that is ruthless to it's players and refuses to hold your hand. The first thing I noticed was how well balanced the game felt on Normal, while it was a bit 'easy' for a roguelike veteran like myself it was nowhere near what I would consider a walk in the park for anyone except the most battlehardened SHMUPS players. I decided to give each difficulty a try to test them out, and each difficult felt very well balanced for the player it was intended to cater to. For reference, I died at the final boss on my first Normal run and completed both my runs on Very Easy and Easy. Hard felt a bit more natural, with enemies now having more attack patterns at their arsenal and you had lower health. At times I would die on the very first floor depending on which mech I chose.\n\nOne of the coolest mechs in the game is called Redshift, and his special is that he can control time. Time stops when he stops, and only starts to move forward when Redshift is either moving or shooting. This is such an interesting mechanic to fiddle with, as he only starts with 2hp and no shields but his special gives you much needed time to think about what move you're going to make next which is invaluable at higher difficulties.\n\nEach run consists of 5 floors that you need to navigate and explore, each floor is filled with tons of rooms that are RNG based so no run will ever be identical. There are four types of rooms, enemies based, treasure based, shops, and bosses. Enemy based rooms are filled with robots who are hellbent on trying to kill you with shiny 80s inspired neon colour bullets. The doors behind you lock once you enter an enemy based floor meaning you're trapped until you clear the room of it's enemies. It almost feels like you're disco dancing while trying dodge all the colourful bullets being thrown at you along with the synth music thumping in the background.\n\nOne of the strongest elements of Starward Rogue are the enemies themselves and how they're designed for you to exploit their weaknesses and their attack pattern themselves. Some of the attacks enemies throw at you look impressive visually and pleasantly surprise you. Enemies would usually specialize in an ability like reflecting bullets off walls or slowly expanding bullets that would lay on the ground and cause contact damage if you didn't wait until it disappeared. Some enemies would have a shield that lasted indefinitely and their only weakness that you could exploit was shooting them from behind, at the same time there could be traps laying around the room that could take your bullets and reflect them in every direction. It was the variety of constantly finding interesting enemies and the element of being filled with traps like laser tripwires or spikes that enemies could hide behind would keep me on my toes at all times. But it was worth clearing all enemy based rooms because they would give you that sweet EXP to level up, and with each level up you were given a choice between 3 upgrades that would benefit you greatly. Level upgrades most commonly ranged between HP, damage or loot based, where I would always choose extra damage since the faster you killed an enemy the less dodging you would have to worry about.\n\nWhen you weren't busy mowing down enemies, you would come across many rooms that were filled with treasure or power ups that would help you in your venture to the last floor. There were even secret rooms where you could sacrifice HP permanently for amazing upgrades such as infinite Energy but with a huge downside where it was only infinite until you received damage for the first time. There are countless weapons and items to be found, some of them adding onto your weapons or outright replacing them. If it's the latter, a box will pop up showing the specs of the weapon you own compared to the other weapon and a description of it's attack pattern.  One interesting moment I've come across is the time when I killed one of the merchants only to find out the stuff he was selling was replaced by super upgrades found nowhere else in the game, but the downside was that you could no longer buy items for the rest of that floor.\n\nI reached the text limit right around here so I'll skip to my conclusion. I'm missing the last 3 paragraphs from my review.\n\nOverall, Starward Rogue feels like a great entry to the Roguelite genre mixing it up with SHMUP and dungeon exploration elements makes it feel fresh and exciting. It isn't the prettiest game around but it is definitely one of the more fun roguelites. The gameplay is great and feels rewarding at higher difficulties for veterans of the genre but I could easily recommend it to anyone with it's well balanced difficulty settings and catchy music. I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of twinstick shooters, or roguelites!","February 2","true","7.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I enjoy getting wasted to oblivion repeatedly but I had to tone down the game's difficulty to 'normal' to get a chance to reach the second floor...lol.

Your arsenal is always random but you are given the option to select from three items in some rooms & purchasable items in others. You can even buy xp if you like! If you die, you restart from the very beginning. Also, every floor is randomly generated with every restart so no two gameplays are ever the same.\n\nThis game is well optimized for use with an XBox controller & it works perfectly by using the left analogue to move & the right analogue to shoot.

I think all top down shooters should be enjoyed with other players.\n\nOverall, I find this game very fun to play.

The combat is fast-paced and diverse but also has a very tactical level to it as well; almost nothing shoots at random, so the game rewards being able to think as much as hair-trigger reflexes.\n\nFor the price, there's a lot of game to run at and good replayability, expanded even further by the difficulty levels. This is definitely not the sort of game where each boss you run into is just a slight reskin of the last. There's a huge amount of enemy and room variation. In all of my playtime, I've yet to feel like I've seen a room over and over. The game is also likely to see even further expansion in enemy types and rooms (amongst quite possibly a lot of other things) thanks to the level of modding that Arcen have enabled for the game and how supportive they are being about it as a developer.\n\nOverall, I'd say it's definitely a very fun game, accessible to a wide range of skill levels and, had I not been in the beta, one that I'd be happily buying right now.","January 22","true","19.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

My playtime exceeds the possible gameplay time since release on Steam cause of that.\n\nNow onwards to the review.\n\n\nBullet extravaganza extraordinaire. Definitely shmup and roguelike gameplay. Everytime I play it it remembers me of the movie Tron. As always a magnificient soundtrack from Pablo Vega bringing back those pac-man era feelings.\n\nIn this game you play as one of 6 choosable mechs. Be it the Flame Tank (kinda beginners mech and my favorite), Red Shift aka time dilation mech (when you don't move or shoot time stands still), White Gloss (average mech with rail cannon), Indigo pole with its magnetic missile launcher that pulls any bullets towards it, Green Envy mech that is meant for players who like loot (higher chance to get credit/keycard) and Deep blue mech with weaker attack but with a droid companion from start.\n\nEssentially each run is divided in to five to seven floors in which you fight through a procedually generated dungeon (from premade maps). You have rooms full of traps like laser beams blocking your way, fire canons shooting fireballs occasionally, moving walls trying to crush you depending on how you move. There are very thin bullets flying through air and blocking your way forcing you to slowly puzzle your way through them without getting killed. There are maze rooms with arrow mazes testing you if you can find the way to the middle where your award awaits (if it was worth the hussle who knows).\n\nEach room you go through has its purpose. Some rooms are protecting bigger amount of health pack or health shards, (8 health shards increase your total healt) or a ton of credits. Some rooms are long hallways where treacherous nearly non beatable enemies await. Rooms with teleporter mazes (hm, which one is it going to get me to that blasted mini room? ).\nThere we have countless mini bosses that can make you pay for your mistake like Hunter who is trying to get you with his shield lines to make you go slower. Or Reaper who likes to lash you and kill you slowly. Then we have countless bosses that all have their personal bullet hells ready for you. There is Crystal Mother with its bullet and bullet lines and bullet walls. Wallmaster with its exchanging bullet walls. Labrinyth with its four henchmen and many many more. Every boss more or less has three stages with which he shows his anger at you after you injure him sufficiently.\n\nWith every floor that you reach and fight through the stakes grow and the game gets harder but not impossible.\n\nThis is one of those games where you think "Just one more run" aka "just one more turn" and the hours go past without you noticing that its already evening :) When you start the game you will ultimately die very fast but with each run the game will get easier when you begin to understand how to play and what the dangers are but remember nothing will save you from the bosses but your own skill :)\n\nHighly recommended!\n\nWill definitely rebuy it later for support.\n\n\nShort gameplay video with me using Flame tank on floor 1:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGU2FAvB4Bs&feature=youtu.be\n\nfloor 2:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4PflUlG9i90\n\nfloor 3:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDCUnOXmEFw&feature=youtu.be","January 22","true","20.6"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/recommended/410820/","Lady_Dawn","Lady Dawn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lady_Dawn/","1305 products in account","What is Starward Rogue? Imagine if a neon-soaked SHMUP had a baby with a space-themed rogue-lite. There's a tl;dr "bottom line" section at the bottom.\n\n.Game play.\nYou are a mech seeking to free your A.I. buddy from a dangerous, robot-infested dungeon. Or... something like that. You can use mouse and keyboard or gamepad. I prefer and used the latter, but movement is fluid and responsive either way.  You can shoot in eight directions (including diagonals) and your mech possesses a primary weapon, an energy weapon, and a missile--more on those later.\n\nEvery mech is unlocked from the very beginning, which is something that I really liked. Each has its own pro and con (i.e, this has more health, but a weaker arsenal or this has less health, but a bigger shield) and each plays substantially differently. My favourite thus far is the one with the flamethrower.\n\nYou get experience for killing enemies, which is a nice little RPG touch, and each level allows you to select a perk for your mech like more health or greater percentage of crits--adding greater diversity to each playthrough. Much in the manner of games like The Binding of Isaac, subsequent runs through the original dungeon opens up more floors and power ups.\n\nAfter every run, successful or unsuccessful, you can view your stats regarding secret rooms found, accuracy, how many pieces of equipment you've unlocked, etc.\n\nThere are six levels of skill, from very easy to suicidal (not really, I just don't remember what the highest was) and they're all available right off the bat.\n\n.Equipment.\nThere's a pretty wide variety of weapons, though I've found that the basic weapons tend to feel the same. It's the energy weapons and one-time use items that really vary up your combat and those can range from bullet-blocking shields to explosive traps.\n\nYour weapons include your primary, which has infinite ammo, your special weapon, which uses energy that regenerates over time, and your missile launcher, which consumes missiles that can be found throughout your run. Interestingly enough, the missiles can also be used to block oncoming enemy fire, which is something to keep in mind when you find yourself in a particularly bullet-hellish situation.\n\n.Enemies.\nThis gets a section of its own if only because the enemy bots found in Starward Rogue are unique and awesome looking. Some are fast and rush at you headlong, some\n\nThere are turrets that fire off bullets and can only be deactivated by clearing the room as well as mines and other floor traps that will damage you if you come into contact with them. There are also breakable objects which can be used as cover and sometimes conceal pickups. Some objects can only be broken by using missiles, adding an element of resource conservation.\n\nAnd then there's the boss fights. These big, bad robots require you to memorize their attack patterns and they switch those up once they take enough of a beating. The enemy A.I. in general is pretty smart and even at normal difficulty I found that I had to be very careful of getting backed into corners or traps.\n\n.Level design.\nNo two rooms look alike. Some rooms will be large and filled with traps and only a handful of enemies, while others will be a maze of corridors that become impossible to traverse thanks to enemy fire. The variety is substantial, but I'm sure if you played through several runs in one sitting, you'd start to see some repeats.\n\nThe level design also forces you to play accordingly or die horribly. In narrow, maze-like rooms, you'll be forced to slow down and try to remain behind cover. In larger, more spacious rooms, you'll be encouraged to dodge torrents of bullets by taking advantage of your full range of motion. In rooms with traps, you'll want to time your movements to avoid laser beams and take care where you step so as not to set off a chain reaction of explosions by stepping into a minefield.\n\n.Graphics.\nLovely. The enemies hail down neon bullets that, and all the partical effects only add to the hectic sense that your life could end if you don't dodge well enough. That being said, the effects don't make it impossible to see your own shots or make it more difficult to find yourself on screen as I find happens in other titles. And, believe me: the screen *will* be flooded by bullets at many points in time during your run.\n\n.Soundtrack.\nOne of my favourite things. It's chill and electronic--the perfect companion for the frantic game play.\n\n.Bottom line.\nIf you're a fan of rogue-lites, pick this up. If you're a fan of shoot-em-ups, pick this up. There are difficulty settings for even the most casual of players, making Starward Rogue easy to pick up for gamers with varying levels of skill.","March 13","true","1.8"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

I'm not an 'action roguelike' player, either. To be honest? I bought this to support Arcen Games. I haven't always loved their games, but I love their brand of innovation, and I hate to see them in dire straits.\n\nSo I figured, "I bought the game--might as well give the game a try, right?" After a couple hours of play, it's pretty fun! Even if you suck at these things!\n\nOn 'Normal' difficulty, the pace of play is measured enough that navigating my way through "bullet heck" is as dependent on strategy as reflexes. And the variety of powerups is super cool! Every game is different after the first few upgrades. And there's such a variety that I haven't seen the same stuff twice. (To be fair, that's in two hours.)\n\nNow, I've seen enough SHMUPs to know they can be very lush and beautiful productions. Arcen doesn't do "lush." But for those familiar with games like AI War and Last Federation, the graphics and controls are frankly better. Everything's clean and smooth, and it's enjoyable to discover the different variations on enemies. As with the loot, there's a whole, whole lot of enemy variety.\n\nI can't say you're in for a fantastic journey through sound. The score and sound effects are pretty basic. You're probably going to want to play your own music in the background, but I do that with lots of games, so it's fine by me!\n\nI'm playing with an X360 controller, which I imagine is how it's meant to be done.\n\nIn conclusion: I can recommend this as an amusement for casual players, especially if (like me) you're a fan of 'roguelike' genre conventions. It's not too punishing, even on the default difficulty level, and the design is clean and sharp.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordfrikk/recommended/410820/","lordfrikk","Jonathan Strange","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lordfrikk/","637 products in account","A surpringly solid twin-stick shooter which takes inspiration from the best of the genre but doesn't just blindly follow in their footsteps.\n\nDespite being pretty skeptical about Arcen pulling it off, I've conclued very fast that, fortunately, it is a pretty fun game! You can choose from 6 mechs who have different stats and some of which also start with some weapons or special skills that makes them unique. One of the mechs literally turns the game into SUPERHOT. For the uninitiated, SUPERHOT is a FPS where time flows only when you move so it basically turns from frantic battle for survival into a very chill experience.\n\nEach mech has 4 slots, primary weapon with infinite ammo, secondary energy weapon with limited usage that refills upon entering a new room, limited ammo weapon like a rocket launcher that functions like bombs in Binding of Isaac for breaking stuff/killing enemies in emergency and lastly a consumable slot. Apart from that you can find drops that just upgrade or modify your mech without being restricted to slot.\n\nThe game starts you off at 5 floors in total, each floor is very Isaac-like with shops, miniboss rooms, secret rooms and floor boss. You also gain experience, upon leveling up you can choose a perk like becoming the Keymaster and getting 100 keys, seeing the non-special and later special rooms automatically on map or learning you gottagofast. Yes, game actually has sprint button for traversing long distances AND for use in boss fights. Some of them like the Hunter miniboss will actively chase you at higher-than-normal speed so you gotta put those mech legs to work.\n\nThe enemies use bullet hell patterns but on normal they are mostly avoidable even for someone like me who doesn't play typical bullet hell games like the Touhou series. That is, at least not until you increase the difficulty and/or get to the later floors. The difficulties alter enemy and boss patterns, among other things, which is really cool way to do difficulty tiers in general.\n\nOverall, the game has pretty rad soundtrack even if it can get a bit repetitive during a longer session and solid gameplay with plenty to do on each floor and bosses that don't feel like copypasta of each other.\n\nIt's a good choice of a time-waster whether you've already played all the usual suspects or just getting into the genre. Highly recommended!","January 29","true","6.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Sounds pretty cool right? It is. This game is tons of fun, I've owned it for just a few days and already have more than 8 hours in it (might seem like a casual time for some, but for me that's quite a lot for a relatively short span of time). The controls are nice and fluid, the game boasts hundreds of items to pick up to augment your mech, and lots of weapons, attachments, bosses, minibosses, and enemies to make each play an indivual, enjoyable experience. With a catchy electronic soundtrack and nice graphics to top it off, the game really comes together.\n\nNow that the good is out of the way, let me talk about just a few issues I have with the game.\n\nI may just be bad, but from my experience there seems to be just a couple room types that are near impossible to come out unscathed. From clusters of enemies that mow you down to tight rooms where you get swarmed easily, some rooms just feel a tad unfair.\n\nAnother room type I for one have a big issue with is rooms where there's laser barriers everywhere that you have to sit and wait to turn off before weaving through to the next segment of the room, only to have to wait some more for the next barrier. It really breaks the flow of the game for me and since enemies are allowed to pass through these lasers without taking damage makes me really frustraded when I encounter such rooms. I feel like I take damage on those rooms because of the layout of the room itself, not because of some lack of skill on my part. I'll admit when I mess up, but in some cases I feel taking damage/dying outright is beyond my control sometimes.\n\nDon't think I'm being critical because I don't enjoy the game, that's not the case. I really want this game to succeed because I'm having lots of fun with it and the company behind the game (Arcen Games) have had to lay employees off because this game hasn't brough as much money as they needed to sustain themselves. I feel with a few tweaks this game could be on par with some roguelikes I love like Isaac or NecroDancer, but as it stands it's showing a huge amount of potential but a few minor quirks get to me.\n\nI would urge anyone who's interested in this game to pick it up. Support the developers, especially when Arcen Games is on the verge of collapse. $12 dollars isn't a huge amount to ask, even just getting 6 hours out of the game makes the expense worth it in my opinion.","February 2","true","10.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/recommended/410820/","mastatsan","Carlz0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mastatsan/","1578 products in account","This game is great, and deserves your attention.\n\nSummary of gameplay: (the big one, TL;DR at the end of this section.)\n\nThis is a top-down, "twin-stick" style game.  Of course, being on PC you can play with mouse and keyboard OR a twin-stick controller like a 360 pad.  It's a rogue'lite'.. meaning, in this case, permadeath and procedurally generated floors.  Similar to games like Isaac, the rooms are hand-crafted but placed in randomized configurations, with randomized enemies, pickups, loot, etc.\n\nYou will be exploring labyrinths of rooms, finding powerups to make you stronger, gaining experience by killing enemies, fighting minibosses, and looking for secret rooms.  Each floor has a final boss that you typically must defeat before proceeding to the next floor.\n\nI don't know how many room designs were made for this game, but it seems like a lot.  Some are small and square, some are very large, long, or wide.  Some have an optional obstacle course of sorts, with prizes for those skilled enough to attempt them.  The design of the room can really change how you'll fight the enemies within.  Some large enemy that was easy to fight in a big, wide-open room may be much harder if you find him in a room that is divided into narrower corridors, or full of environmental hazards.\n\nYou, and most of your enemies, fire bullets, beams, and other ranged attacks, and the game can be a little bullet-hellish, especially on some of the bosses that I've seen so far, who shoot in very bullet-hell-like patterns. This is what I like most about Starward Rogue.. most enemies fire different types of shots, in different configurations, meaning each one is a unique challenge, especially the bosses and larger enemies.  I've also come across a few very unique and well-designed bosses that break the mold a little bit, and add even more variety.  The enemy variety is top-notch.\n\nThe weapons, consumables, and upgrades that you can get are full of variety, as well.  Aside from the fact that there are several different mechs, with unique starting configurations, that you can play as; as you play, you'll come across chests, shops, boss drops, and other ways of obtaining new and interesting weapons.  Some are objectively better than others, while some are just a matter of preference, playstyle, or the 'right tool for the right job.'\n\nYour main weapons consist of a main gun with infinite ammo, a subweapon that uses a universal ammo simply called "energy", and a missile launcher.  The subweapons tend to have the more unique effects (such as the Guardian Blaster, that fires a shotgun of bullets that can destroy enemy fire, as well as harm enemies), though there is plenty of variety to the main guns as well.  Missiles can be used offensively, but are often best saved for destroying obstacles that cannot otherwise be destroyed.\n\nYou can also carry one of many consumables, which each have their own effect that can be used once, and then the item is gone.  There is one slot for passive 'defensive' items.. and you can also find or purchase different robot buddies that will circle around you and do stuff.  On top of all of that, you can find all kinds of upgrade items, and collect as many of those as you like.\n\nAnd that leads me to another strong plus for me. The game is not cryptic about what items do.  You can walk over something to see what it does before you pick it up, and the descriptions are usually pretty clear and straightforward.  It doesn't try to screw you over, force you to trial-and-error, or make you check a wiki to know what you're getting.\n\nI almost forgot perks!  Basically, you gain experience, level up, and pick from one of 3 perks, similar to something like Nuclear Throne.  Simple, but another layer of complexity that may make you play your run differently, or give you more options when combating foes.\n\nTL;DR: There are lots of weapons, enemies, items, room layouts, and just lots of variety in general.  Plays like a twin-stick shooter.  Procedurally generated floors comprised of hand-made rooms, similar to Isaac, with a bit of Geometry Wars and Nuclear Throne thrown in.\n\nGraphics:\nYou can see them for yourself by watching the trailers, or looking at the screenshots.  There are some really cool-looking enemies, and each floor has it's own theme to the floors and walls.  The lasers and bullets are shiny and pretty.  You can see what you're doing, tell things apart, etc.  Overall, pretty good graphics, unless you just hate 2D games or something, for some reason.\n\nSound and Music\nHere's the thing about sound effects.. when they're good, you hardly notice them.  When they're bad, you notice.  I haven't really noticed anything bad, so they must be pretty good.  Nothing has really seemed out of place or ugly, to me.  There's a nice little sound effect to let you know when you've cleared a room.  The guns go tatatatatat and pew pew and fwooosh, and the explosions go boom..  What more do you want?\n\nThe music is okay, but it's not really my thing.  After a while, I turned it down a bit and found it more pleasant to have it faintly in the background  Other people will probably love the music, it's just not really what I like.\n\nControls and OptionsI have played using a 360 pad, and my mouse and keyboard.  Both work good.  I may slightly prefer mouse and keyboard, but the option of using a controller is nice if I want to sit back a bit and relax, or hook up to my TV and play from the bed or sofa.  Everything is rebindable, and the bindings make sense as-is.  I like that with my 360 controller, I can shoot at any angle with the right analog stick, or at 8 compass directions by holding the face buttons (individually, or two at a time for diagonals)\n\nAll aspects of the sound can be adjusted individually in the options menu.. and there are plenty of options for graphics and performance, too.  Fullscreen/window, resolution, refresh rate, scale.. even brightness, contrast, and sharpness! Nice!  And there are toggles to turn off shadows, reflections and such for people with slower computers.  Very good job on options.\n\nConclusionI like this game, if you couldn't tell (duh).  It emulates the Isaac formula a bit, but definitely has its own thing going as well.  The game seems stable and I haven't noticed any bugs (except one time when the game seemed to hang on a black screen when I tried to start a run.  No biggie, at least it didn't ruin a run in progress.)  Nothing seems lazy or half-♥♥♥♥♥, and I'm struggling to think of any real 'cons' besides not personally caring much for the music, as mentioned.\n\nLike most indie games, it's inexpensive and this is certainly well-worth the price.  And you really have to hand it to Arcen Games for always trying new things, and finding ways to bring twists to old ideas.  Even if their games aren't always the most popular, they have a few hits, and this is totally one of them.  So try Starward Rogue, and tell your friends about it if you like it.  At the time of writing, it's a hidden gem, but I hope to see more people discover it and play it.","January 29","true","2.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

The tutorial was sloppy and abrupt, the UI is average, some of the visual elements fall flat, and the soundtrack is rather repetitive.\n\nIn spite of all of this, I am going to recommend this game.\n\nPut simply, this game completely nails the most important elements in this genre. The game handles well with a gamepad, the variety of rooms is staggering, there are plenty of different weapons to choose from, and the game handles the balance between the player's three guns (one of which has infinite ammo, one of which has finite ammo that requires pickups to be refilled, and one of which has finite ammo that recharges between rooms). There's also six classes that all play completely differently and a few frustration-reducing features like a Borderlands-esque shield that lets you take one hit per room without losing health. Special commendations, however, go to the enemy bullet patterns. Every foe has a distinct and elaborate firing pattern, some of which require thinking ahead or precision to successfully avoid. In this way it's closer to a bullet-hell style than other games in this subgenre.\n\nI must also note that balance-wise the game is still rough around the edges in a few places, but Arcen Games seems to be vigilant on fixing issues while adding small amounts of additional items and minor refinements. Not enough to detract from a recommendation, but I feel it would be amiss to not mention this.\n\nIf you enjoy other games in this style, pick this one up. I can say with certainty that this is the best twin-stick shooter I've played since The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. It's also worth recommending to anyone who likes arcade shooters of any type, as the RPG elements one would associate with a roguelike are very downplayed, leaving only a XP system and currency.","April 19","true","10.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It's very good. One of the main things that sets it apart for me is RNG isn't totally running the show. You do get random items and perks, but there are many opportunities to leverage what you have for something different, a lot of the time at a cost. Being able to actually spec into what you want means you can not only have your own play style but actively work towards it during the course of the game. Not to mention the fact that there are 6 different mechs to suit your style to begin with.\n\nThe music on this game matches the pacing so well, and it is just pumping. Beasting a room is followed by a rise in the music volume. It feels good.\n\nMovemewnt is crisp and precise (unless you're sprinting), obviously a must for a game that gets pretty bullet heavy at times.\n\nArt style and sound are effective throughout. Weapons you pick up are represented visually on your mech, and have their own unique sound effects. The devs also understand the use of bass for music, explosions, and guns.\n\nHeres a video going further in depth on the game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3bma2jUf5o\n\nWhole-heartedly recommend this game.

Starward Rogue is less action-adventure and more bullet-hell shump. Rooms quickly fill up with shots of all kinds and the game has less crazy upgrades compared to Isaac. Overall, I enjoyed the game, but I'm not seeing the replayability and variety that Isaac had with the ever growing items and their combinations and varients of rooms and enemies. Still, a great first attempt by Arcen and hopefully one that does well enough to let them continue supporting it.","January 24","true","4.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

To get this to work, I rebound the secondary weapon to capslock, and I use the touch-screen to aim and fire the primary weapon (hold finger to screen = fire).\n\nMy original plan, after playing it for a few minutes, was to wait for the Steam controller to arrive -- the Steam controller that I ordered after playing this for a few minutes.  But, waiting would mean not playing for several days.  So I adopted the control scheme above.\n\nObviously, Redshift is the mech to use if you're uncertain about your control.  But I've played as all of the mechs so far, and beat the game with the treasure hunter.  The White Gloss mech looks boring, but the advantage of so much health is that you can spend it on health-costing upgrades.\n\nIt's a shame that killing shopkeepers is so punishing.  OTOH, it's pretty easy to kill them, and they don't hunt you down afterwards like they do in some similar games.\n\nMore mechs, please.\n\nMy life's goal is to get the "fit for a Hydral" achievement.\n\nWhat I'm saying is, this game is good.","February 2","true","2.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I started out on normal but got killed multiple times in the first room floor. After I switched to Very Easy, it got a lot more fun. There are lots of different enemy types and each floor has multiple minibosses in addition to a main boss at the end. It's pretty chaotic, but there's also a lot of strategy. There's ammo management over three different weapons: a primary gun with unlimited ammo, an energy weapon that recharges every time you enter a new room, and a missile weapon that you have to find ammo for. Additionally you can collect credits which you can use to buy upgrades in shops and you also gain exp for killing enemies. After you gain enough exp, you gain a level and get to choose from one of three perks at random. There are also shops that let you buy powerful upgrades at the cost of some of your max health. These are pretty cool, and are an interesting risk vs reward system. You'll also find keycards throughout the levels which unlock secret chests and rooms, though there probably won't be enough for everything so you have to pick which you want more. For instance, you might have to choose between unlocking a loot chest or a shop which has defensive items. This isn't my favorite game of theirs, but it is a lot of fun for a couple hours at a time and I definitely see coming back to it again.","January 29","true","7.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Although the game is simple at first, the higher difficulty levels require you to master the speed of your mech.  You can speed it way up, walk at a normal speed, or walk very slowly.  Learning when to do what is crucial for successfully dodging the complex bullet patterns.  There is also a ton of variety in weapons and attachments, and a huge selection of innovative enemies.

I'm a turn-based guy these days.

You have to manage your ammunition as well as health, and you can't just mash fire buttons and get through. Some thought is required while dodging, you have to constantly plan your next target, attack angle, weapon choice and movement.\n\nIf you're worried that this is a reflex-based game, the more forgiving difficulties don't take away the fun, and it has a challenge for the brain as well as the spine.

Also like most of Arcen's games, it combines a lot of ideas into a package that ends up being a little bit greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nWhat SR does, is take some of the most superficial aspects of Binding of Isaac (randomized arena style rooms) and mixes it with some bullet-hell sensibilities.  Selectable characters, adjustable difficulty, and some freedom of choice within game to customize your build adds up to a game with quite a lot of replayability, and potentially a lot of challenge. And if you don't want to slog through multiple playthroughs to unlock everything, there is an "Everything Unlocked" mode (though trophies and unlocks are disabled while you play in this mode)  Overall, this is a really solid game.\n\nPS: Good luck to all the staff of Arcen.","January 29","true","3.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I will play on a harder level later on to make it a bit more challenging.\n\nSo far my only complaint is that there isn't really a definite sound effect when you get hit. I'm used to Isaac and friends grunting when they get hit by a ball of blood or a certain boss named The Bloat.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reath987/recommended/410820/","reath987","Reath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reath987/","662 products in account","Starward Rogue is a sci-fi roguelite with bullet hell influences. The game takes a lot of inspiration from Binding of Isaac. The basic structure is the same, although SR adds a lot of its own twists on top of it. It's also much more intense, often having a huge amount of bullets on screen at once.\n\nThere's a large variety of weapons. You can carry one of each type at once, and swap them with ones found in chests and stores. Energy weapons are interesting in that they have a limited amount of ammo, but automatically recharge whenever you change rooms. This is a clever way to encourage using the weapon regularly. There's also an experience system, along with selectable perks. All in all, the game has a good amount of depth, without feeling overwhelming.\n\nYou can pick from six different mechs at the beginning of a run. All of them have different starting loadouts and attributes. One of them starts out with an unique ability, which pauses the time whenever you stand still. This makes the game almost feel like a turn based game. It's pretty hard to use, but it's an interesting alternative way to play the game.\n\nThe camera can be zoomed out further than Steam's screenshots show. Doing this makes the game look a lot less claustrophobic. If you're using a 1080p monitor, the game shows a good amount of distance around you by default. For lower resolution displays, there's an option to zoom out the view. This is very handy, as being able to see the bullets from further away makes them easier to avoid.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, featuring high resolution 2D graphics. The UI has a simple look to it, making it easy to read.\n\nThe soundtrack features a variety of upbeat electronic music. They're all good songs, and fit the game's atmosphere well.\n\nMost of the game works well with a controller, but the menus were obviously made with a mouse in mind. Some of them require you to move a cursor around with the analog stick, which is a bit clunky.\n\nThere's more options than you usually see in 2D games. I especially enjoyed the option to switch to SHMUP style controls, which removes the friction from your movement. It makes the game feel a lot more responsive and familiar, for those who are used to playing bullet hell games.\n\nI recommend Starward Rogue to anyone who enjoys roguelites or shoot em ups. It's a fun game, with few flaws. It's challenging, yet the difficulty rarely feels cheap. Arcen Games has a reputation for releasing interesting, yet flawed games. However, Starward Rogue is much more polished than their games usually are, so give it a shot.","January 29","true","51.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorrorFox/recommended/410820/","HorrorFox","Horror Fox :3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HorrorFox/","343 products in account","Hey everyone and this is my review about the game!\n\nThis is a Rogue-LITE bullet hell FAST PACED top view game.\n\n\nInterface/Menu/Settings\nYou can have multiple File slots. (Up to 6)\nThere is a Toolbar at the bottom right with settings/Stats/Trophies and other things.\nThere are in-game Achievements.\nYou can change the in-game controls.\nThere are alot of Different Resolution sizes.\nThere is Screen/Sharpness Bar Slider.\nThere is a Volume/sound/voice/Combat bar slider.\nYou are able to play this game with a Xbox controller.\nYou are able to choose from 6 different MECHS. Sadly there are no "unlockable MECHS"\nYou are able to choose from 5 different difficulty settings. From Very easy to Very hard.\n\nEach Mech has their own advantages and disadvantages, Power and weakness.\nThere is no Random button, so you have to choose a MECH.\n\nI think the "Delete file" and "back to file select" are a bit too close to each other. There will be a warning notification however if you press the "delete" by accident.\n\nAbout the game.\nThere is a tutorial.\nText lines are voiced over.\nYour hitbox is your head. Bullets won't damage and hurt you if it hits another part.\nMusic is weird and OKAY on the same time. (loops alot and if you get a bad soundtrack it could be even annoying too)\nMusic does need some variety.\nThere are passives buffs. (Example: You attack for 25% faster, Your damage is 25% lower).\n\n\nIf you press ESC,  you will see your equipped items. In the middle you will see a MAP.  However you can't see your active/consumables here.  So if you have forget about their stats. Well there is no way to look back, However you can see their effects.\n\nYou are able to see items on the Map and if you hover your mouse over the rooms. Then you are able to see which items. Only 1 icon will be shown on the map, so if there are more items in that current room then the only way to find out is by hovering the cursor over the rooms.\n\nThere are shops, You can trade Credits/Money for experience or items.\n\nYou have an experience bar and you are able to level up. If you kill enemies you will get experience.\nYou can choose 1 perk out of the 3 once you have gained a level.\n\nThere is a "Devil's room", You can trade your MAX health for items. So if an item is -5, You will permanently lose -5 HP for that current run.\n\nThere are "Health Shards", You have to see it like those collectable hearts from Legend of Zelda. Once you have enough Shards, you will gain 1+ Max HP.\n\n\nAbout the Ships.\nI will explain about the ships a bit. I won't spoil too much. There are no unlockable or Secret Ships.\n\nShip 1:  This is the Standard Overall ship. Nothing too Special about it. It's a good beginning MECH and it is easier to dodge bullets. You are able to see the MECH's Head, which is the only part that is able to hurt you. I personally don't like the secondary weapon.\n\nShip 2:  This is one of those "High risk, high reward" Ships. He is very strong and kills enemies in no-time but his energy is on the low side and his range is very very limited. You have to be close in order to kill the enemies.\n\nShip 3:  This is a ship that requires alot of patience but could be rewarding. Especially his secondary weapon. It places a landmine, which only could be good against big or fast enemies.\nHis missile makes him unique and a lifesaver too. It attract enemies bullets. So if you shoot the missile and bullets are already on your way. Well the Missile basically drag them away and makes you unharmed.\n\nShip 4:  This ship pays off the longer your run goes. You need to gain more experience in order to level up compare to the other ones. But in return you will be able to find more cash and even KEYS! His secondary is a monster but not accurate, This is one of my favourite Mech's including Ship 5.\n\nShip 5:  This is my other favourite Ship. He has weaker attack power but he has a companion that helps killing enemies. Secondary weapon is only powerful if you charge him up. Otherwise it won't offer much. Attack speed isn't high aswell and he is very vulnerable. A difficult ship but fun!\n\nShip 6:  This could be a good second beginner's ship to see the enemy attack pattern. I find the idea from the unique power very well done but on the same time it slows down the game by alot. Enemies and bullets will stay still (even your own) if you are standing still aswell. So you could see them coming. Secondary weapon is powerful but the biggest downside that the ship has is surviving. Starts with only 3 HP and no shield makes him the most squishiest ship on the game.\n\nOther things.\nThere is no option to open the map only. You have to press ESC in order to open the map. It would be good if you only press 1 button and you will see only the (Zoomed) map.\n\nOnce you have cleared a room, You will hear a "notification" Sound.\n\nMusic Changes everytime if you enter a "Devil room". So if you want to hear a different music track, Go inside of the Devil room and go out again. Not happy with the soundtrack? then go back inside again.\n\nSoundtracks keeps looping over on the current floor and there is no "Toggle to next song" button.\n\nThere are "Secret rooms", You are only able to destroy those walls with missiles.\n\nI RECOMMEND TO GO THE OPTIONS/SETTINGS. Then go to GRAPHICS and slide the ZOOM BAR all the way to the left.\nThis will make the game a bit more easier and avoids annoying camera's. The game will be a bit more zoomed out and it will improve your gameplay.\n\nI do see some Potential for Local Co-op. One with keyboard and the other one with Xbox controller.\n\nThe Run will be saved automatically, So if you decide to stop and play later again.

There is always at least 1 in a room and it is super easy to boost out your Health. I had once 3 of those Health shards in  a single room. You need 8 Health shards to get +1 Max HP.

There's not much story, but that's not the point, is it?  You came here to see bullets flying across the screen by the hundreds and to fling lead at dozens of enemies, all of whom have their own quirks.  Ankle-Biters which try to attack you from behind while you engage them from the front.  Bulldogs which rush up to you, grab on, and slow you down.  Spiders which create web-like trails of bullets, making the place unwalkable.  Banshees which SCREEM BULLETY DEATH when you shoot them.\n\nAnd that's before we've even engaged the difficulty modes.  This game knows there's a casual croud and has both an Easy and a Very Easy difficulty. I had to give up on Normal, I couldn't finish 7-floor runs (I was barely managing the 5 floor runs!) Above Normal, there's Hard, and then Misery.  Hard already made someone want to punch Misery in the face so you can only imagine the horrors that await the hardest difficulty (oh, you thought "Misery" referred to your state of mind while playing it? No no, the Misery difficulty is called "Misery" for forumite Misery who had a hand in creating so many of the enemy shot patterns).\n\nYou have it in your wishlist, it's only $10, why haven't you purchased it yet?","April 3","true","37.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There's a solid range of difficulty levels, from easy to the forthcoming Misery mode, and I found Normal to be nicely balanced for me, and I'm merely decent at bullet hell games.\n\nThere are six mechs that change the gameplay in small (weapon changes) to huge ways - one mech will stop time unless you move or shoot, turning the game into this weird combination I'd call tactical, turn-based bullet-hell. I haven't seen anything like it, and I adore it - threading the needle to fight the bosses poses some tense questions - dodge or inflict more damage. But I digress: the standard mech is more than fun enough, presenting fast gameplay that caught me in the trap of "one more level!"\n\nYour mech is armed with the standard bullet hell style infinite ammo shooter that you can aim with the mouse, a missile launcher, and an energy weapon that varies by mech - the basic mech has a bouncing ball of bullets, while the time-stop one has a machine gun burst.\n\nThere's a huge variety of weapons and items - I found myself a ghostly sword that would erase bullets directly in front of me at regular intervals, and I learned to love it - up until I got sloppy with a third floor boss and died. Whoops!\n\nThe levels are randomly generated pre-made rooms - some are mazes, some are open arenas, some have laser traps and other complications, and they're populated with a huge variety of enemies, each with their own bullet patterns.\n\nNow - flaws. The music is good, but you'll hear the same tracks multiple times while playing.\n\n... That's it. That's all I've got. The game seems balanced so far, I'm having a blast playing it, and the graphics are great. There's a nonobtrusive plot, the tutorial does its work, and I was able to easily put the game into windowed mode.\n\ntl;dr It's a top-down bullet hell shooter with roguelite elements with a lot of variety that presents some interesting twists on the genres - AND it's fun to play.

You get several different characters to use, all of which vary in stats (stats being your health, shields, damage, stuff like that), weapons, and some even have awesome side effects during the game. After you choose both the character and the difficulty, it drops you into a level. I'm pretty sure this game has the same floor level creation process as the Binding of Isaac. A large amount of pre-made rooms are set up, and then those rooms are randomly plotted around to create the floor that you traverse through. Anywho, the game has a lot of content right now. Lots of different varied enemies, lots of different room designs that make some rooms tricky to deal with, so on and so forth. The only thing this game lacks, in my opinion, is a lack of both MUSIC and ITEMS. The music, while awesome and catchy, does get old after a while. There are, like, 4-6 different loops (not including the boss music) that play during the different floors, and it gets kind of tiring after a while. I would really love to see more music added in the future. The next problem is the lack of items. Now, there is still quite an amount of items in the game. Different primary's, secondaries, attachments, useables, so on and so forth. Shops that offer you health/shield upgrades, and other things like that. But even with all that, there seems to be a lack of them. As I play the game more, I will change this if I notice a difference and there's actually, yknow, a LOT more then I've noticed. But until then, there ya go. It's a game that I would extremely recommend for it's price tag, and it's super fun.","February 6","true","22.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I love rougelites, but most of them do not offer a ton of varied strategy in approaching a win; generally you don't get many options, and the options you do get are dealing with the items/situations handed to you. This game gives you a ton of options each run. Do I take more damage? I could, but I have such little health! Or, I could forego both and choose to get more credits ($$$) from enemies.\n\nThe devs clearly love this game and are very active on the forum. I asked a question and made a suggestion and it was patched in literally 3 days later. All of the changes since launch have been positive ones, and the game feels well built as is. In an age where games are perpetually in Early Access, having a roguelike/roguelite that is a complete product is also a major bonus.\n\nAnd of course, this game is a LEGITIMATE bullet hell. Trust me. Turn the difficulty settings up if you don't believe me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/recommended/410820/","angryjedi","Amarysse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angryjedi/","481 products in account","I’ve followed this interesting developer for a few games now, most notably A Valley Without Wind and its sequel: two games that fused, oddly enough, turn-based strategy with Metroidvania-esque platform shooting. Arcen’s latest game Starward Rogue continues the dev’s tradition of fusing disparate genres together, in this case arcade shooters and roguelikes.\n\nI say “disparate”; Starward Rogue isn’t the first game to combine roguelike elements with a shoot ’em up core, but it is the first I recall seeing designed around the principles of Japanese-style arcade shooters, particularly those of the “bullet hell” variety. That means intense, complex bullet patterns that you need to navigate through as well as enemies to defeat, and it makes for an exciting, very interesting take on a genre that all too often coasts along without any real innovation.\n\nStarward Rogue casts you in the role of a severed head in a mech as you attempt to rescue someone called Rodney from the depths of a dungeon called the Megalith. I believe these two elements are a reference to one of Arcen’s other games, but it’s one I’m not familiar with at this time. Fortunately, no real knowledge of whatever the other game it’s referring to is required; it’s simply a bit of fanservice for those who have played the game’s spiritual predecessor. Rodney is an entertaining character in his own right, though my only direct contact with him so far has been in the tutorial sequence.\n\nStarward Rogue‘s gameplay is balanced nicely between exploration and action. Each level of the Megalith is split into discrete rooms, each of which has to be cleared of enemies before you can move on to the next one. Unlike similar games such as The Binding of Isaac, though, Starward Rogue’s rooms are often more than a screen wide and tall, and there are a number of unique designs and layouts that you’ll encounter over the course of the game, which are then combined with various enemy and trap waves — the latter tending to be non-destroyable obstacles or gun turrets that will spew out hot fiery death as you try and take down the enemies, then deactivate when you’ve cleared the room.\n\nLevelling up is a simple process: no stat allocation here, simply pick one of three randomly selected perks. These vary from increased damage to having a full map available from the start of the floor — and even being able to skip the rest of the floor you’re on. Alongside these passive bonuses you get from levelling, you can also equip and upgrade your infinite-ammo main gun, your recharging Energy-based weapon (which recharges when you enter a new room) and your limited-ammo Missile weapon. There are also various other passive upgrades you can collect, and one-shot consumable items that generally have some sort of “smart bomb” effect.\n\nMuch like the aforementioned The Binding of Isaac, Starward Rogue is a game intended to be replayed and rechallenged. There are a number of different mechs with which to play the game, and there’s a checklist of enemies and items you’ve found over the course of all your runs. There are also five difficulty levels to choose from, with Very Easy all but guaranteeing a full clear run unless you are the very worst kind of incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥, and the highest difficulty claiming to offer difficulty on a par with the legendary Touhou series. And on top of that there are a bunch of achievements to earn, too, so it’s very much a game that will keep you busy for a long time if you get it — though it’s accessible enough to be able to pick up every so often for a quick blast even if you’ve left it alone for a while.\n\nI completed a Very Easy run earlier — there’s no shame in starting either a roguelike or a shoot ’em up on the lowest difficulty, and this game is both! — and am already looking forward to giving it another shot soon. If you’re a fan of The Binding of Isaac and its ilk — “roguelites”, to use the popular term — then you could do far worse than give Starward Rogue a look.","January 28","true","3.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/logorouge/recommended/410820/","logorouge","logorouge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/logorouge/","90 products in account","Now that I beat the 3 wardens and finally completed a full run, I think it's a good time to write a small review.\n\nThe game is a healthy mix of roguelite and bullethell. Think Binding of Isaac with mechs and lasers, where the huge selection of enemies all have very unique styles of attacks. But don't get scared by the Bullethell tag, it's not the "barf bullets all over your screen and call it a day" bullethell, it's more like "each pattern is a little puzzle you have to solve to dodge it" bullethell.\n\nControls are tight, which I think is pretty crucial for a game like this. I do recommend activating the option called "Use SHMUP-style controls" so you can stop your movements at a moment's notice. You'll be glad you did during most boss fights.\n\nDifficulty-wise, the 5 levels of difficulty available before each run can give players of all skill levels a fun time.\n\n-Very Easy: Enjoy the ride and learn at your own pace\n-Easy: Quite forgiving\n-Normal: Challenging\n-Hard: Punishing\n-Misery: Still in preparation, but a good description for it when it will be released should be "OH GOD, WHY?!"\n\nFor each run, you get to select a mech to use from a selection of 6 so far. You got the treasure hunter mech for extra cash and stuff, the flame tank to get a strong starting kit, the time manipulating mech that lets you stop the action to think/plan for a bit, the vanilla mech that's good at everything but doesn't have anything special per say, the magnetic mech that can break through any bullet pattern and finally, the energy mech which can fire its secondary weapon for extended periods of time.\n\nWeapons/items variety is pretty good from what I've seen. (Up to 231 so far if I look at the ingame menu) Which weapon would you pick? A super fast machinegun or a powerful flamethrower or a fancy phaser that can shoot through walls? Add to that a secondary energy weapon and a bunch of upgrades/modifiers and things can get crazy. Crazy fun that is. Consumable items were a bit underwhelming/overpriced, fortunately those were tweaked in an update and are now quite desirable/effective.\n\nGraphic-wise, the game looks clean and colorful. You can spot enemy bullets without issue and it's easy on the eyes. What's not to love?\n\nFor the story, the tutorial does a good job of quickly explaining what's going on and what is expected of you. I thought the voice acting was pretty neat and the humor well dosed, but opinions on that may vary. It's short and pretty straightforward, but I personally like it that way.\n\nThe music isn't really my genre, but still found it well done and enjoyable. Doesn't detract from the experience and adds to it instead. There's a lack of variety in the number of music tracks available, but I remember reading the devs were planning on adding more later. So hopefully we'll get more tracks from their very talented music composer in the future.\n\nModding: The devs took extra care to make it easy for the community to make their own content for the game if they so desire. New enemies, new items, new mechs, new room layouts, new bosses, etc. I always appreciate it when devs put the effort to allow easy modding.\n\nBugs and balance: Since this is an Arcen game, if something seems weird or just not fun, you can report it and the devs will listen. Plus, those guys are ridiculously fast at releasing updates. You reported getting stuck because of a glitch? Don't be surprised if you get an update a mere few hours later, fixing your issue the same day. How awesome is that?\n\nOh my, this review got a bit lengthy after all.\nIn conclusion, it's a very good Isaac-style roguelite with a very satisfying bullethell aspect that will keep you coming for one more run, over and over. Pure, concentrated fun filled game. Highly recommended.","February 6","true","79.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

With a capital E. The only flaws I can see are these: Story, which has been mentioned before on the forums, and arcen says they're aware of the lack in story and are working on that so it's not a concern. Items. There aren't that many things that switch things up a lot. Yes, there's the incredibilities, but i'm talking about something like mom's knife of brimstone from TBOI. Something less normal than, say typical glass cannon aka risky assassin. Finally, rear-burst turrets. They seem like a cool idea. Turrets that shoot bullets behind you which explode into more bullets sounds neat but they easily snipe with the extremely fast bullets that then explode, thus creating the bane of anyone who took risky assassin, which removes shields and reduces you to 1 health, thus causing anything that hits you instakill you. 1 health + nigh-unavoidible damage = ragequitting. I haven't mentioned any good things about this game yet, which is because everything else is exellent, however i'll go over the best things in this fantastic game here. Updates. Updates and bugfixes come faster than holidays, even more so if you don't count every obscure holiday you can think of(or look up on google). Enemy variety. The enemies aren't typical "flying thing that shoots bullets"esque tropes. Laser boomerangs? Check. Slow bullets that shoot fast but short range bullets behind them? Check. Bosses that use intricate bullet patterns to create a maze and then spawn minions that use slow-moving bullets to hinder your movement even more? Check. Difficulty.  The difficulty settings range from "Literally like 3 minutes of standing still for a boss to kill you" to "5 hits with bullet patterns that Touhou would be scared of". Anyhow, I give Starward Rogue 8.5/10 for an exellent roguelike.","February 21","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The enemy variety is excellent, with creative designs involving strange bullet patterns and AI behaviours. The weapons are interesting too, and quite distinct. There is even a character to play as that changes things into a neat sort of turn based mode where enemies only move when you do.

If you like skill based challenge with rogue-lite randomness and permadeath then this game is for you.\n\nI find the challenge to be more skill based than knowledge based and for that it's a welcome change from BoI.  When I die in this game, it's because I screwed up. This is in stark constrast to BoI where I feel that half of my deaths are caused by wrong item choices based on incomplete knowledge of the possible item synergies because I haven't looked them up.\n\nThe choice of difficulty level is really satisfying. Normal is a fun challenge while hard is an impressive step up in difficulty without feeling like it is impossible one. It's definitely a bullet-hell game on the harder difficulties and trying to manage missing all of the bullet patterns while still hitting the bosses is a rewarding challenge.\n\nEDIT:\nMy only complaints is that not all of the menu options in the game have intuitive controller mappings. For example, in the pause menu, it gives you a mouse like control to select options.  Lame.  But that doesn't take away from the fun you have while playing it.","January 31","true","12.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

With a capital E. The only flaws I can see are these: Story, which has been mentioned before on the forums, and arcen says they're aware of the lack in story and are working on that so it's not a concern. Items. There aren't that many things that switch things up a lot. Yes, there's the incredibilities, but i'm talking about something like mom's knife of brimstone from TBOI. Something less normal than, say typical glass cannon aka risky assassin. Finally, rear-burst turrets. They seem like a cool idea. Turrets that shoot bullets behind you which explode into more bullets sounds neat but they easily snipe with the extremely fast bullets that then explode, thus creating the bane of anyone who took risky assassin, which removes shields and reduces you to 1 health, thus causing anything that hits you instakill you. 1 health + nigh-unavoidible damage = ragequitting. I haven't mentioned any good things about this game yet, which is because everything else is exellent, however i'll go over the best things in this fantastic game here. Updates. Updates and bugfixes come faster than holidays, even more so if you don't count every obscure holiday you can think of(or look up on google). Enemy variety. The enemies aren't typical "flying thing that shoots bullets"esque tropes. Laser boomerangs? Check. Slow bullets that shoot fast but short range bullets behind them? Check. Bosses that use intricate bullet patterns to create a maze and then spawn minions that use slow-moving bullets to hinder your movement even more? Check. Difficulty.  The difficulty settings range from "Literally like 3 minutes of standing still for a boss to kill you" to "5 hits with bullet patterns that Touhou would be scared of". Anyhow, I give Starward Rogue 8.5/10 for an exellent roguelike.","February 21","true","32.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Each mech has various pros and cons that set it apart from the others, and the difficulty choices encompass all types of players, whether you want a casual experience or a gruesome challenge.\n\nDungeons consists of various rooms. Most have enemies in them, which you have to kill before proceeding further, others have some kind of puzzles or obstacles such as lasers that go on and off in a pattern. You also pick up a variety of items and equipment for your mech to improve them for the duration of the run. At the end of the floor there's a boss, which you have to defeat in order to be able to descend to the next floor. Bosses all have unique attack behaviours and are generally very fun to fight. I'd say, this game is very similar to Binding of Isaac, except in a sci-fi setting.\n\nVisuals are very pretty and shiny, despite being very simplistic. At first some stuff can be a tad confusing, like the glass floors overlooking space at first seemed like death drops/impassable places to me and it's not often easy to tell which of the obstacles are destructable and which aren't. Music is all right too. There are some nice upbeat tunes here and there, but I think the music in other Arcen games is way better.\n\nIt's a simple but fun gameplay. Don't expect deep tactics and strategy like in other Arcen games (such as Bionic Dues and The Last Federation), but if you just want to have some fast-paced fun and challenge your reflexes, then the game is well worth getting. It is a welcome change to see an indie dev that changes the formula in each of their games and does something new rather than churning out clones all the time.","February 4","true","7.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is fun, fast-paced, graphically well-polished and unique, with a lot of customization options and smooth, fair controls.  A good coffee-break sort of game that is easily played in short bursts, or as long as you like.\n\nYour goal is to clear a dungeon room-to-room, floor-by-floor, using your primary weapon with infinite ammo; your secondary weapon that uses energy that refills every time you (re-)enter a room; your finite supply of missiles; findable modules that give unique passive effects or abilities; 1-shot uber consumables; and your ability to WASD-dance your way between a hail of living, oft-unpredictable bullets.\n\nYou can find or purchase power-ups, health restoration pick-ups, ammo for your missile launcher, new weapons for your primary and secondary slots (which can be a HUGE boon in either case), etc.\n\nYour choice of class at the start of a run can have a huge impact on your run based on their various strengths and weaknesses and starting weapons, but once you start picking up new weapons and power-ups, the character you started with may be a different one entirely from the one you die a painful death as. :D\n\nYou will lose.  A lot.  But this game is fast-paced--you can rest between clearing rooms, though--and fun, and death never really feels unfair.  The wide selection of difficulty levels also ensures you'll always be able to have a good time, as well.\n\nHighly recommended either for casual fun, masochistic self-harm, or anything in-between.","March 28","true","2.9"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I've been playing on normal difficulty and doing pretty well while still being challenged, as someone who doesn't usually play twin stick shooters that's a good balance for me. If you're more experienced in the genre you can ramp up the difficulty.\n\nI would say that this game doesn't seem to have the breadth of features that other games in this genre have, for instance pickups seem to be mostly upgrades with little drawbacks, except for weapons which are more varied and have their ups and downs. In these kinds of games you usually get some risk/reward decisions with item pickups that you don't get much of here - you'll pretty much want to pick everything up. There are challenges on each level though, like don't use missiles to get a big boost next level sort of thing, which is a neat idea.\n\nThe character selection isn't huge, but varied enough to be interesting and they're all available from the start which is a big thumbs up from me. There aren't really any unlocks that I can see, which is great for someone with limited time.\n\nStarward Rogue is a fun game that you can jump into and it wont suck thousands of hours of your life away, a run can be done start to finish in a couple of hours, more or less depending on skill.

There are different mechs to choose from, with a slew of different items, plus a perfect combination of bullet hell thrown in.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatdamath/recommended/410820/","whatdamath","WhatDaMath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/whatdamath/","297 products in account","This is a pretty good title for the niche that it tries to represent, but I would not recommend this to a casual or regular gamer. In a nutshell, Starward Rogue is a twinstick shooter mixed with RPG and rogue-lite elements. You play as one of six mechas shooting enemies progressing from level to level and unlocking special weapons and skills.\nThe game is quite challenging and many casual players will be put off by the lack of other essentials:\n-no catchy music\n-graphics are sub par\n-gameplay is limiting\n\nThere are however some good things about it, such as a variety in terms of gameplay when it comes to mechs. At least one of the mechs, gets a unique mechanic of stopping time and only advancing it when it moves around. Other than that though, I'd have to say "pass this unless you really lack a challenging twin stick shooter in your life and are okay with it being mediocre in other departments"\n\nEDIT:\nA lot of you inquired what I meant about "no catchy music".\nIf you play other Arcen titles you'll notice that sometimes despite really mediocre graphics, it's the sound effects and music that give their titles that extra atmosphere. A twin stick shooter title is also often dependent on some sort of a catchy and rhythmic melody that makes you want to come back to it over and over. This title however lacks that and it feels like a product that was pushed out of the door a bit too quick in that sense.\n\nAs for the gameplay being limiting: when I played this title it didn't draw me in even as a twin stick shooter. It felt impersonal. It didn't make me feel like I was the last survivor of a catastrophic disaster or had some strange reason to persevere and defeat the neverending overpowering enemies despite all odds. It just dropped me into the middle of a randomly generated level (thus the rogue part) and told me to go on my merry way using a somewhat generic control scheme, generic enemies and generic level layouts. Nothing really screamed "omg, I wanted to do this more". It was more of a "ok...well I died now should I really bother to do this again?"\n\nAll in all, it's an okay title and I definitely recommend supporting the indie game developers, but I feel like this title in particularly has been pushed out of the door a teeny bit too soon and most likely because the modern indie developers are under a lot of scrutiny when it comes to releasing games and competing with others.\n\nSo all in all, good title, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you want to donate money to an indie company because you support the industry.","January 27","false","3.4"," 35 of 138 people (25%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","25","35","138","2","15"

Whether it's "slow down and stop running over spikes" to "maybe next time you shouldn't trade your shield for health" I never feel like the game cheated to kill me. I just cheated myself.

Like all Arcen games this one has some nice outside-the-box design concepts.  I only played for about a half-hour at this point but I can see myself coming back and playing some more as the game is very appealing.   Personally I picked up the game more as a 'Arcen fan' than anything else but for the money it is worth it even if you are not just a fan of the developer.  I am no bullet-hell expert for sure but from my short time with the game so far I would have to say that Starward Rogue is one of the better more interesting ones I have played in a good while.  I personally like the look and feel of it better than games like BoI.","June 4","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
