I'm very happy that the game and developer will get the greater attention that each deserve through the new release.  It's an amazing but simple platformer that really demonstrates how much there will always be left to do with what seems like an old genre.  The game might follow just a few simple rules, but the emergence of complex phenomena from the seemingly simple restraints will be a constant and entertaining challenge.\nI remember reading a blog post by the developer where he stated challenging himself to not use the color green for the surfaces of the game.  It would be too easy to make the ground green, too obvious.  He instead chose to work the color in such a way that green would be implied, giving us dusk views where the blue suggests grass, or strange and outlandish colors that strangely connect themselves to grass in our minds.  The same degree of thought went into every aspect of the game, and it certainly shows.\nAs far as I’m concerned Ian Snyder is right up there with Terry Cavanagh, and this game shows it.\n","May 30, 2014","true","2.9"," 52 of 57 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","52","57","0","0"

As the title states, the floor is jelly! So every surface you touch bounces around, which creates chain reactions you utilize in the game. For example you can jump higher and higher if you time it right, because the floor will bounce you up and down. There are different "worlds", each with new mechanics that are very creative and get harder and harder as you progress. It's a platformer, one that's tough from the second half, but it feels quite different from others on the market.\n\nThere's a great variety of levels and mechanics, and I never got bored of the art style. However as mentioned in the cons the difficulty curve gets quite random - there will be random very difficult levels between some easy ones, before I really got used to the controls. It took me roughly 6 hours to beat, but I am speaking for one that likes platformers but doesn't play very difficult ones. I've read on forums of people finishing in 2 hours or less so if you've played something like Super Meat Boy that'd be closer to what you would get out of the game.\n\nThe art style and music are both amazing, very pleasing to the eyes and ears! Music is relaxing, on the minimalist side.\n\nDo I recommend this? Yes, it's very aesthetically pleasing, with refreshing mechanics that'll give you a good sense of achievement.","May 30, 2014","true","7.0"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","49","54","0","0"

A lot of different mechanics - you won't get bored with jumping. The game is pretty short but diverse. Calm music fits the gameplay.\n\nThe game is written in FLASH, so it will lag A LOT, especially when you get these flying white things. It will also lag when there are too many curves. Yes, the calculations take a lot of CPU, but why should I care? The game runs SLOW and it is unacceptable for a platformer. One slider for music volume and game volume (the music in the water level was meh and there was no way to turn it off without silencing jumping sounds too), non-customizable controls. No map at all - exploration may be fun, but not when you are trying to remember all these windows. Achievments should be always related to the game itself (I am talking about "U KNO WUT I LUV" which requires visiting site about another game. If you want to add puzzle reference in your game  - don't make it an achievment).\n\nThe Floor is Jelly is a good game, but not good enough to make me replay it.

Disregarding the obvious stickiness it sounds like a rather ridiculous and amazing idea to me, but luckily video games exist so we no longer have to wonder and can see for ourselves what a world made of gelatin might be like. As it turns out, Ian Snyder's The Floor is Jelly is almost entirely as delightful and playful as you could hope for, with so much raw joy and charm oozing out of it that I found it nigh impossible to restrain the enormous smile plastered across my place as I played.\n\nAs the extremely literal title lets you know, the floor (and pretty much everything else) is made of bouncy, jiggling jelly that sways and molds as you platform your way through levels. More than just an enjoyable gimmick, Synder constantly finds incredible simple but ingenious ways to use it as a mechanic, from the obvious trampoline effect propelling you higher, to bouncing into the ground to momentarily cause it to sag as you scurry under obstacles. The game never dwells on any one jelly application for more than a few levels, driven by an erratic "need" for variety that keeps every level feeling completely unique from the last, but held together by the constant wobble of the world. The nonlinear structure is incredibly relaxed, never wanting to punish the player and allowing you to explore at your own pace, which is a very welcome change from so many hyper demanding platformers we've seen released as of late.\n\nThe one instance where the continual reworking of mechanics works against the game is in the final few levels, which take on a faux-glitch design that involves changing the properties for the jelly you bounce on. The idea is good in theory, but in practice it causes the world more often than not to spazz entirely out of control, leaving it largely up to luck if you can make it to the exit before things go insane. It's really a shame that it ends on a pretty sour note, because up until that point I was absolutely in love with the game and its laid back atmosphere, which the later levels go entirely against. Some unexplainable slowdown and technical issues add to the list of annoyances that should have no place in such a beautiful game.\n\nTake one look at any of the other moments in the game, and it's hard to stay upset about a lackluster ending. The art design is absurdly charming and endearing, with the way the jelly moves being particularly delightful in ways I can't put into words. The color pallet changes with each new level you enter, all of which align with a chill design philosophy akin to laying in a hammock on a lazy summer day; it's impossible to keep from wanting to stay in this world forever. A gorgeous soundtrack by Disasterpeace (who my admiration for seems to grow on a daily basis) perfectly blends into the background, with spurts of sound accompanying your actions, creating a dynamic musical score that feels like a living organism playing along with you.\n\nIt's not quite perfect, but The Floor is Jelly enchanted me in ways I haven't felt from a game in a long time. The level of love poured into the game by its developer is palpable, to where you really want to overlook the bad bits because there's so much more to enjoy about the experience. It probably won't charm everyone like it did me, and anyone looking for a challenging or lengthy (you'll likely finish it in about 2 hours) will come away disappointed, but if you can take it for what it is The Floor is Jelly is the sort of game that's more than willing to curl up under a blanket with you and hug you to death with its cuteness.\n\nMaybe that's a little weird to say about a game, but The Floor is Jelly inspires unusual praise and deserves all it receives.","June 2, 2014","true","1.8"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","2"

If you ever played - and liked -Super Meat Boy then this is for you. It doesn't have any controller support however, so movement is a bit more difficult compared to using a controller but it's easy enough to remember as it's literally only a few keys to take into account.\n\nThere are several worlds, all with their own physics and little puzzles (if you can call them that). You drop out of a window and have to enter a window somewhere else in the level. But there are many obstacles in the form of platforms and you have to be quick or need to know how to figure out how the physics work. Fortunately the levels last only a few minutes and they're easy enough to complete...\n\n...Until the end, that is. Near the end the world becomes corrupted and the levels become frustratingly hard and start to rely on luck instead of skill. And this goes on for quite a while. Every time I thought I was finally finished, the game gave me new levels. They kept coming. Until finally, it stopped. In that aspect the developer seemed to try and mimic Fez, which is totally unnecessary because it has enough charm and style to give it its own identity. A little bit disappointed there.\n\nThe graphics are colorful and the style reminds me of Ibb & Obb (which I haven't even started playing yet). It looks great, especially the animations and things like flowers popping up from the ground and the music is relaxing, even if it's repetitve.\n\nThis isn't a very long game. I think it can be finished within 2-2,5 hours. Which is more than enough for me personally. Platformers usually don't stay fresh long enough to keep them interesting for tens of hours. But that's my opinion, of course.\n\nSo, in short; The Floor Is Jelly is a great platformer, but prepare to be annoyed and frustrated near the end. Look past all that and you have an incredibly smart, charming game right here.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","June 4, 2014","true","2.9"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","0"

The game looks beautiful from the very beginning and the music, which changes as you progress through each uniquely designed zone, is best described as relaxing. While the controls handle well, it was initially difficult to get used to them due to the nature of the "jelly" floors, walls, and ceilings. The minimal astheitic accompanied by tranquil melodies really does wonders for this platformer.\n\nNow that the positives are out of the way, I can honestly say that I will not be recommending this game at it's ten dollar price point. The options menu, unfortunately, lacks numerous features including the ability to change the resolution and rebind hotkeys. More importantly, it is not worth spending the game's full price tag when you find yourself stuck in a wall after only 11 minutes of gameplay. Common sense tells me that I should be able to open the menu and restart the level. For whatever reason, there is no such option. For a game of this genre, a simple level restart feature that you can bind to a key is a must.\n\nRestarting the game fixed the glitch and respawned me back at my previous checkpoint. After roughly 20 more minutes I stumbled upon another glitch. The new checkpoint where the game had me saved had no ground below it causing me to continuously fall to my death upon each respawn. Restarting the game has no effect as there is no way to switch checkpoints or restart the level. The only solution is to clear my save file and start again from the beginning. Unbelievable.\n\nEvidently, there is a workaround which you can find here that involves 3rd party save editors. However, this should not be necessary for a game with a Metacritic score of 81.\n\nIt is unfortunate that my experience with The Floor is Jelly has been a negative one. If you decide to pick this game up, do so when it is on sale and pray that you don't get stuck.","July 9, 2014","false","0.5"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

Why so? well, the hate part comes purely from the controls and that mixed with the theme of the game (jelly floor mechanic). There were times when I was close to rage quit, the controls just feel so off in some of the segments of the game (there were numerous times, when I just dies because of the really overly sensitive and not so accurate controls). Also the only way I was able to play this game with a controller, was to use Joy2Key. Normally control issues like this would be a total turn-off for me, BUT the love part was just so strong, that it made me want to play and play it again until I finished the game.\n\nI'd like to say, that in a way this game is a lot like games 140 and BOXBOY!, not because its mechanics or simple aesthetics, but the fact, that this is a kind of game I'd like to call "concept game". What I mean by this is, that it takes one core mechanic and then explores that mechanic to the fullest, presenting all kinds of scenarios tightly wrapped around that core. And boy, The Floor Is Jelly does it so well, like 140 and BOXBOY! do to their mechanics.\n\nThe level and scenario design is just really good, and has a lot of variety between the different challenges the game throws at you. Sometimes the consistency of difficulty level isn't perfect, having some difficulty spikes, but overall the difficulty is well executed, not easy, not frustratingly hard either. Aesthetics are simple but very pleasing to the eye. Music/sounds are also perfect fit for this game.

No title describes what this game developed by Ian Snyder is really about more. This is a platformer game where you control a little tiny human guy and guide him through each level, with each level split up into several rooms connected by windows.\n\nYour little guy can jump around, and can climb up walls by jumping up them like in the Mega Man X games. It doesn't sound that simple, though. Whereas other platform games took place on solid ground, in The Floor is Jelly, well, the ground acts exactly like that. As you move around, the ground beneath your feet violently wobbles and jiggles around like a gigantic waterbed. It's not just the ground that flings around, too. Even the walls and ceilings ripples and bounces as you wall jump and hit the ceilings retrospectively. It's not all bad, however. You can take advantage of the wobbly ground by using it as a trampoline, but you'll need to time your jumps right or your bounce may fall flat. It may take you a while to get used to these bouncy castle physics, but soon enough, you'll be bounding around like a pro.\n\nThere's no enemies or monsters to fight, but there are plenty of hazards along the way. Each level is strewn with bottomless pits and dark purple spiky blobs, and if you fall or hit them retrospectively, you'll be sent back to the entrance of the room. Thankfully, there's no lives to worry about or anything, and you restart very quickly as well, which is good.\n\nThe puzzles are well done as well. For example, very early on in the game, you'll come across a spiky wall which you cannot seemingly pass. You'll have to bounce on the ground next to it and then use the resulting ripples in the ground to quickly run underneath it. Had the world have been solid and not bouncy, this wall would have been outright impossible to get past. Each level also has their own gimmicks as well; two stages have water where your gravity is reversed underneath the surface, and you'll need to utilise the resulting momentum to get through their rooms at times. Another level sees you rotating several structures to let rain water reach white plants while trying to keep 'catflowers' out of the rain at the same time. Another level has platforms that only become solid while you're touching one at a time, allowing you to slide down or walk across into the inside of another platform, which then becomes inverse-solid in which the outside is solid and inside is air. Some levels are less linear than others, these levels require you to explore to find a certain number of 'keys' that will open a portal that leads to the exit.\n\nAfter reaching the end of the first level, you'll come to an underground cavern which serves as the game's central hub. As you make your way through this bouncy cavern, you'll come across a large locked door, and you'll need to beat the three levels that this cave branches out to in order to unlock it. Through this door is a darker cavern that branches out to three more levels, and after beating them, you'll unlock another door that leads to the final two stages.\n\nThe final two stages is where the game starts to get more tedious. In the second-to-last level, you must jump around in low gravity to find three keys at the end of three separate sections to unlock the portal. It sounds simple at first, but then as you grab each key, the way back becomes riddled with... I won't spoil it entirely here, but let's just say 'instakill hazards' on the same lines as spikes. These hazards are erratically placed, and often requires trial and error in knowing where they are, leading to a few deaths. The final stage itself is no better, with most rooms requiring sheer luck rather than skill to get through.\n\nThere's also a few secrets hidden around the world as well. There's 31 in total, and each contains a house that contains a terminal. Activating all 31 terminals unlocks a neat secret that's fun to mess around with. However, there's 6 terminals that can be permanently missed in the second-to-last level as you start collecting those three keys, and with no warning or indication that this is the case until it's too late, it's pretty frustrating to have to restart your save file.\n\nThe aesthetics here are amazing. The environments are beautiful and dreamlike, the wobbling of the ground is very fluid, and the interactivity is incredible due to the world's bouncy properties. Objects like trees and bushes sway and move with the wobbling ground as you bounce around, and in two of the levels, if you bounce next to a tree or bush, the sudden movement of the tree or bush may scare off any birds nesting in them and then they'll fly off to a more stable tree or bush. There's other neat stuff, too, like frogs making wobbles in the ground as they hop around in the underground hub level, and the rain in the Wetlands level makes the ground constantly jiggle as each raindrop pounds down onto it. The houses in the secret areas are built on stilts, and even wobble around as you jump onto them as well as onto the ground underneath. There's also a neat window effect that let's you see their randomly generated interiors as you get close, but disappointingly, their furniture stays fixed in place, no matter how much the house wobbles. Each level is also accompanied by a beautiful soundtrack, most of which is written by Disasterpeace, known for his work on music in other games like Fez.\n\nUnfortunately, some effects could cause slowdown at certain times, such when more intricately generated houses are onscreen. The initial Humble Bundle release allowed you to switch to lower quality graphics in the options menu to help eliminate some slowdown, but that option seems to be missing in the Steam release.\n\nDespite it's playful physics and unique platformer gameplay, The Floor is Jelly is over way too soon. A level editor would have been amazing, with the ability to create our own jelly worlds and share them online, but it's very unlikely we'll see one anytime soon.\n\nPros:\n+ The whole world is bouncy!\n+ Varied stages.\n+ Soothing music by Disasterpeace.\n+ Bouncy worlds!\n+ Dreamlike environments.\n+ Some well hidden secrets.\n+ Some of the bounciest landscapes and caves in videogame history.\n+ No lives to run out of, and very quick restarts.\n+ Very fluid wobbling effects on the terrain, and how the background objects wobble and move around with it.\n+ Did I mention bouncy worlds? Because the world is bouncy.\n\nCons:\n- Some slowdown in some areas.\n- No low quality graphics mode.\n- No level editor.\n- Secrets in the second-to-last level are permanently missable, with no warning given.\n- Final stage relies too much on luck rather than skill most of the time.","June 27, 2014","true","50.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Super Meat Boy is totally a no-no for me.\n\nWhen I first saw The Floor Is Jelly and noticed it had insta-kill spikes and tricky jumping, I was sure it was not for me. I still got it, but figured it would not be played much. I was wrong.\n\nIt does have some really tricky bits, and you will die a lot on some levels, but the gameplay is just fun and actually quite relaxing. There is rarely anyhing to force you to rush, you can take your time and figure out the level, while listening to the wonderful ambient soundtrack.\n\nThe influence of a game like VVVVVV is clear, especially with the kind of open world and the need to explore more than the usual platformer.\n\nClocked about six hours on this, including a bit of exploring, and enjoyed all of it, even the slightly hard puzzles and jumping sections. Of course, if you are part of the OCD crowd and want every acheivement expect to spend a lot more...\n\nI played it with a controller, and it's probably easier than with the keyboard, since you have more analog control on the stick.\n\nHighly recommended if you want a nice platformer which is not too frustrating, with orginal gameplay and a great soothing soundtrack.","June 5, 2014","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The level design is solid, twisting your brain just a little to do most levels. The floor is indeed jelly-every surface is elastic, meaning you will oftentimes find yourself building up tons of momentum and leaving a jiggle mess of straight-edged surfaces in your wake. It's fun to build up speed, but unfortunately, you rarely get to use it. I can definitely recommend the gameplay to any platformer fans.\n\nThis game also features music by Disasterpeace, the artist behind the Fez soundtrack. Which is good. Unfortunately, the game doesn't stop there in its similarities to Fez. There's a distinct "meta" aspect to every scrap of "plot" you reveal while playing the game. There is even a point where the game "breaks" and you play through it (a la Fez's opening/glitch level). There are several secret terminals spread out through the levels, and on them is some code you may or may want to decipher (I didn't). The secrets and the related deciphering is almost completely borrowed from Fez's anti-cube collectables. Furthermore, the game has no enemies, and focuses on exploration. This is not specifically something Fez owns, but it does add to the familiar atmosphere.\n\nNow, I said "unfortunately," but I actually love Fez. What gives? Well...Fez has a semblance of a plot. It has more of a point to "meta" items and hints of a long-forgotten ancient race. The Floor is Jelly has...nothing. There's nothing set-up for you at the outset, there is very little text, and everything tossed in feels just, well, tossed in. It reminds me more of antechamber in how developed its world is than Fez does, by a long shot. So taking elements from Fez just feels out of place.\n\nAll this talk of unneeded elements is just a gripe though, something I wanted to point out. Overall, it is a solid game with a solid draw, even if the follow-through is somewhat shallow. I enjoyed my experience. I don't think I'll play it again, but I definitely would tell a friend who likes platformers to try it.","October 4, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What if the whole street was jello, or the continent? The world? The Floor is Jelly posits a universe made of jello. Purely for your amusement. No longer need we look to our walls and our floors and sigh: "How solid! How sadly immalleable! How I wish for a world consisting only of Non-Newtonian fluids!"\n\nDeveloped by Ian Snyder, this game realises this dream. The world is filled with simple, yet utterly beautiful, shapes and colours. All underlined by music (adapting dynamically) composed by Disasterpiece. The gameplay is spot-on perfect! The controls are tight and the exploration drives your progress forward steadily. The only gripe that one could hold against the game, is the time frame, which is with two hours, on the shorter side. Nontheless, this game is a must buy if you are somewhat interested in either platformers or artistic indie games.","May 31, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The levels vary in difficulty, flip-flopping from hard to easy on some occasions. It did seem to drag on a little bit in some sections, but that wasn't too bad.\n\nIt's shortly after the third hub world that the game takes a nosedive. I'm not sure what the developers were thinking when they made this design decision, but I really wish that they hadn't. They took their basic gameplay style and chucked it out the window in favour of what I can only assume is their attempt to be zany and wacky. Suddenly, the very concept of the game has changed and there is no consistency in the core mechanics that the player has used up until this point.\n\nBecause of this, I can't recommend the game.

The graphics and music are pretty good, and the challenge of trying to use bouncy jelly to reach the end is a novel one, compared to many other platformers where the world is totally solid. The game falls down in some key areas though:\n\nNo map. This game requires a lot of jumping through doors that lead to adjoining areas. Unfortunately, this makes it very easy to get lost, or go in loops. A map that updated new levels as you found them would have solved this, and without it things can get very frustrating.\n\nThe jelly physics isn't consistent. Most of the time you can count on the jelly to interact in a certain way, and that's fine once you learn how it works. But there will come times when the jelly just refuses to act the way it did before, and you will randomly get thrown off a wall into the void, or find yourself completely unable to jump up. Given that is the whole point of the game, I find it very frustrating that this issue existed. [This issue gets more pronounced later in the game].\n\nThe controls require a keyboard, and I just found it very difficult to play this way. I feel this game would have benefited greatly from controller support, so you may want to look into a keyboard-xinput mapper if you want to play it.","November 15, 2015","false","2.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I just don't know where to start. The environments are so unique; sometimes you are in a cave, or space, underwater, or you are in earlier levels plus a big twist. (You'll see what I mean) Second, the music is so soothing and subtle. At one point in the game, there are flowers that you can jump on like trampolines that make a guitar note when touched. If you jump on abunch of them in a row, I swear it makes a song. Third, it's just so intricate, beautiful, immersive, and fun. You feel a lot more like you are in the world when every step you make disturbs it. Not only that, but throughout the levels you are faced with all sorts of different puzzles, and it becomes a lot more than a platformer. The trees (coral in the underwater levels) are so perfect for whatever environment they are in, and it makes a really cool effect. Not only that, but there are so many little details that makes it even more beautiful.

Because it is Jelly and very wobbly aswell :)\n\n2. Because the art work is lovely and very colourful. :)\n\n3. Because the game looks fun and very, very cute, and also very differant, because its Jelly and it wobbles like jelly aswell :D\n\n\nWhy I am Giving a negative review for The Floor is Jelly !\n1. Because the controls are just awful. Spacebar to jump, and arrow keys on keyboard to move around, this I dont like. :(\n\n2. Because no controller support at all, this I prefere, but thats just me I guess. :(\n\n3. I payed $5 au at 50% off. I feel for my playtime and enjoyment time this was to much and should be maybe 75% off :(\n\nMy personal view of the game, what could improve it !\n1. Please add controller support, this will make the game easier to play and to control the little guy :D\n\n2. Please add some lovely trading cards, as I love the little cute emoticons. But this is not really important ;D\n\n3. Please if you find platformer puzzler games very difficult, then believe me I found this even more difficult than Ori and the  Blind Forest, thats why I did not play much of it. The controls are shocking I think.\n\nThe game is rather well made, and very promising. :)\n\nBut I would like to be able to control the little guy much better, the keyboard controls I just dont like :(\n","April 5, 2015","false","0.7"," 25 of 52 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","25","52","0","5"

Great visuals, really! Something uniquely done. The jelly physics are pretty nice, though you would need to get used to them. Jumping requires precise timing (need to time your jumps as you bounce back up from the jelly) so this again needs getting some used to. The soundtrack accompanies the cheery and colorful nature of the game well.\n\nOnly negative thing about the game for me is that the game is 4:3 ONLY. This somewhat breaks the immersion. Worse is the fact the screenshots on the store page have been "gamed" to look like 16:9! Mind you, this is not game breaking, but I'm just peeved the developer wasn't upfront about this and would like to highlight this to others.\n\nSo yeah, from the short time I've spent on it, the game is something unique. 2D indie platformers are a dime a dozen, but this can stand tall and distinguish itself from the horde.\n\nUPDATE: Having completed the game, I would say it was disappointing overall, but not outright bad. A lot of nice touches (the visual aesthetic especially) but the game didn't have a hook. It just didn't draw me in. I don't have any problems with the relatively short length, but this was a game that felt...empty. There was no soul here, for me at least. Given I went in with lofty expectations, I naturally come out disappointed. Would still rate it around 6/10, so it still gets a thumbs up from me.","June 25, 2014","true","3.4"," 7 of 27 people (26%) found this review helpful","26","7","27","0","0"

Not a particularly difficult game and actually generally relaxing with its simple graphic style and calm music, and I think that's best how to play it.\n\nUnfortunately the game runs into a few poor design choices; one of the puzzle mechanics does not seem well-suited at all to the bouncy gameplay style, and as well, the entire endgame sequence is, while interesting the first time through the game, not very fun and very unfair.

The atmosphere crafted by the art style and music will help to sooth your frustration as you work your way around the puzzles presented to you. The levels are eloquently designed to guide you in the right directions without being overt.\n\nThe platforming puzzles offered by the game can be quite challenging. My laughter in the first few levels turned to swearing mid-way through the water levels as I plunged myself again and again into the spiky blobs of death. Expert maneuvering is required to bounce, dive and narrowly avoid touching the spiky blobs to get to the next window. Despite my vocalized frustrations though I couldn’t stop. “Just one more time, I’m so close, just a little in the other direction…” I kept thinking. And then finally I would make it to the window! “Hey, this level doesn’t look too hard, let’s give it a try” and the cycle would continue.","September 22, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Floor Is Jelly is a very fun, addictive, and creative game.  You play as a little creature jumping across jelly floors that make you bounce high if timed correctly.  You go through a fwe zones.  Each zone has a different and fun gimic.  The controls are perfect, very responsive and allow for easy movement in the air after you jump.  The graphics are beautiful.  They are very colorful and unique.  each zone has its own very specail color scheme made up of bright colors which give the game a very fun atmosphere.  The story is non-existant, but this is the type of game that is fine without one.\n\nMy only major criticism is the game's length.  It took me 5 hours to beat on my first playthrough.  This is the saddest part.  The game was so fun and creative that it really left me wanting more.  I hope the devs expand this game with free updates (no DLC ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t).  If this game was 8-10 hours long, it would be perfect.  Anymore than this would make the game tiring.\n\nAll-in-all, good game.  Smooth controls, creative levels, and nice atmosphere are its pros, but its lenght is a big con.\nI give it an 8/10","April 4, 2015","true","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The good thing about it is that this jumping on jelly follows some sort of rules and there's several sections of levels each offering a new twist on this mechanic or simply just a change of scenery. The problem I have is the last section of levels just throw away all the timings and rules you've learnt and just make a mess of just about everything. For me at least, completing the last couple of levels didnt require any skill but just an insane amount of luck and the willpower to not give up. I'm all for dying and trying a level over and over again if it is my fault that I have died, but this wasn't the case, the wonky game mechanics for the final levels was killing me and I was much less happy about this. It is a shame it couldn't finish well because it was down as one of my favourites up until the craziness at the end, that being said it certainly isn't a bad platformer and I'm reasonably glad I played it but to be honest I won't be rushing back for another playthrough. I'm recommending based on the beginning but once you've finished the space levels I'd advise calling it a day and ending on a high.","March 27","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No rules or mechanics are ever explained (except maybe in the title). Yes, the floor is made of jelly, but that's all you know. Your goals are windows that you must use your knowledge of jumping on jelly to achieve. There are things you need to collect every now and then to open up new doors, but there are no sign posts to guide you. A lot of the game is exploration. The other main part is puzzle solving. Slowly, they begin adding new mechanics, never explaining them to you but giving you a safe(ish) place to experiment with them until you figure out how to manipulate your mechanics and environment. There is a bit of simple(ish) puzzle solving in order to unlock your goals at times, which adds another bump in the interest curve since, as usual, you have no indication what the puzzle is or how to solve it. This start getting crazy at the end, adding in mechanics like low gravity, high gravity, permanent deformation of the floor, the penultimate "the floor is spazzing out", and the final "the floor is NOT jelly."\n\nPros:\n+Lots of variations of tasks, mechanics, puzzles, etc. Everything stays fresh and nothing wears out its welcome.\n+Very atmospheric music. Music reflects surrounds and is ultra soothing. Do yoga to this, honestly.\n+Great art. Minimalist with lost of variations of color in the levels. Wintry white and blue, beautiful sunsets, bluish wetlands, warm pinks and oranges, etc.\n+Nice level of difficulty. Not simplistic or trivial, but not frustratingly annoying. I felt challenged without feeling stupid, and I'm really terrible at platformers, so it's good for different skill levels.\n\nCons:\n-Short. My total runtime was 3 hours.\n-Last few levels hurt my brain, not because of the difficulty level but because the platforms seriously start spazzing out and take over the whole screen. (No, not a glitch, it's one of the mechanics introduced.)\n\nOverall: 10/10. Super fun puzzle-platformer. Would bounce again.","March 4","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Firest, there is no gamepad support, and that is very odd for a game like this since it would be quite enjoyable as a couch game. Second, there is a level where you can become stuck and have to restart your save. I was fortunate enough to encounter this level early (you can do some levels in any order) and it can be avoided if you know what to look for or have a bit of forethought but it is still a problem.\n\nAside from that, the game is short, but memorable. What story it tells isn't unique in this age but that doesn't make it less charming and the graphics and music compliment each other very well. Having a stringed instrument accompany a jiggly world was a good idea.\n\nThe last level is very frustrating and intended to be completed in unconventional ways - as far as the rest of the game is concerned anyway - but it's not necessarily a flaw. it is nonetheless challenging in a different way than the rest of the game but the rest of the game makes up for it.\n\nThe levels themselves are varied and keep the experience interesting. My personal favorite level was the rain level. I also think all the levels, with the exception of the last one, are of acceptable length; I never felt like I was in one for too short a time to appreciate it or too long to become bored. This is definitely a game I can see myself replaying in the future.\n\nIt's definitely worth your time. If nothing else, at least buy the soundtrack.

Its cutesy exterior hides a dark secret. Sometimes the controls made me want to smash things, but I kept on playing because it's very compelling and I wanted to finish it. But people should know going in that some mechanics are just unnecessarily frustrating. By the time I got to them I was already invested in this game and wanted to love every aspect of it, so this was ultimately disappointing, and the ending of the game just escalated my negative feelings. However, I'm still giving it a thumbs up, I just wanted to warn people if they happen to read my review - you will have fun, but you will get angry.\n\nAs much as I enjoyed this game and would like to get all the achievements, the controls are bad enough that I'm unfortunately going to pass on this achievement hunt.

The colors, the concept, even the physics are amazing.\nSo, pros and cons, let's go.\n\nPros\n+ Easy game to get into.\n+ Simple controls, you can only jump and move right and left.\n+ Momentum based physics, similar to the Portal series.\n+ Runs very smoothly.\n+ Vibrant color scheme.\n+ Beautiful graphics for a 2D game.\n+ Not very much money. 10 dollars for 7 hours of fun? Hell yes!\nCons\n- The game has no direction. There's no tutorial or anything.\n- It gets very confusing at some points, like when your being chased around by a rainbow fake code error.\n- This game needs a better epilepsy warning.\n- Almost impossible achievements.\n- You can't use WASD to my knowledge, just the arrow keys.\n\nOverall, the game runs smoothly with amazing graphics, is easy to play, but can be a bit confusing at times.","May 26, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/recommended/295750/","literaryvideogames","Literary Video Games","http://steamcommunity.com/id/literaryvideogames/","23 products in account","The Floor Is Jelly places the player in a beautiful world composed entirely of—you guessed it—jelly.  This translates to gameplay in a variety of ways, but most notably the player gains momentum by bouncing off the gelatinous ground and walls.\n\nWhile this sounds like a fantastic set-up for an intense platformer, developer Ian Snyder shies away from that approach.  Instead, the majority of The Floor Is Jelly involves loose experimentation in order to solve puzzles.  Although there are a few difficult platforming sequences—especially as the story progresses towards its conclusion—this game focuses more on experimentation than frustration.  This style of gameplay works well—instead of appearing as yet another Super Meat Boy clone, The Floor Is Jelly establishes an identity in a crowded 2D platformer market.\n\nThe relaxing, relatively easy gameplay meshes perfectly with the game's art and music.  The minimalist world pulses with energy, and the soft soundtrack (produced by Disasterpeace) fits the art style perfectly.  I would go so far as to say the simple beauty of The Floor Is Jelly turns playing these levels into a mild stress relief.\n\nThat said, this is not a game without flaws.  Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of The Floor Is Jelly lies in the game's complete lack of story.  I love plots hidden in abstractions, but Snyder's game doesn't even go so far as to announce itself as a generic love story.  Instead, the player is left with bright colors and the wanderings of an odd shape. My other two complaints warrant less attention, but I still wish they had been addressed: first of all, The Floor Is Jelly does not offer controller support.  The arrow keys work well enough, but I greatly prefer using my Xbox controller.  Secondly, the ten dollar price tag may be seen as too high for a game that takes between two to four hours to beat.\n\nOther than the lack of story—my only serious concern with this game—there isn't much to critique about The Floor Is Jelly.  Ian Snyder took a common concept and transformed it into a standalone game.  The excellent design, combined with the incredible art and music, turn this into a game worth checking out.\n\nFINAL SCORE: 8.3/10\nThis review was written for Literary Video Games.

Your goal in this game is basically to complete each trampoline-like environment level and make your way to the last door.\n\nCompared to other platformers, this is by all means not a difficult game, nor are the puzzles extremely hard to complete, but the gelatinous environment gives this game a super, unique twist, that definitely adds a lot of replay play. There are some stages that require quite a bit of luck to beat, but it doesn't hinder the gameplay to a huge extent... just makes it really tiring and frustrating when things don't go according to plan. Some of the best game design I've seen especially during the later stages.\n\nOverall, the soundtrack for the entire game was super soothing; very minimalistic much like the game. It doesn't crowd with the situation and certain sections of the players movements can add to the music giving it a different playthrough each time. Visual asthetics wise, the graphics and colour scheme in this game is breath taking. So simple yet so stunning.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nFavorite stage would have to be The White World.\nWhile blinding to the eye at first, it's definitely one of the more challenging stages, but once you figure out the pattern on how to trigger certain platforms, the stage becomes super fun. Play it backwards for the achievement, and it becomes twice as fun and challenging!","July 26, 2015","true","19.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
