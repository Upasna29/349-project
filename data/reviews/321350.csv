The idea is sound enough, and the trailer is tempting, but the execution is lacking soul and substance.\n\nSo what works? You can dogfight both AI and human controlled fighters. The AI fighters are a lot easier, but still rewarding. You also have to discover the universe, it's not justg handed to you on a plate. This encourages exploration. The controls are ok.\n\nWhat doesn't work? The sound is weak (which is easily fixed guys!). The waypoint system is a nightmare. Scratch that, the nav system is a nightmare. It needs simplifying. If a civilisation can create a spacefaring culture, then the navigation system would be paramount, and easy to use. You can fly a space station. Sounds cool right? Wrong. Space stations are for deploying and making money from while you are away doing someting else, not blasting level 1 pirates!\n\nThis game is not as terrible as some reviews would suggest, and even though there seem to be periodic updates, there is no info on the steam channel about what those updates are doing.\n\nOverall this is playable, and a definite distraction, but the price is too high for what you get and there are stronger games out there for about the same cost that bring far more to the table.","October 25, 2014","false","1.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","2"

I've seen many improvements/updates made to it, and each time the dev has listened to the players, made changes they wanted or needed.  The community is a big deal in this game, and luckily it's a good community.\nThe combat/flight side of the game is smooth and well executed and it's a breath of fresh air to play a space mmo that gives you direct control of your ship.\nTrade and exploration is a big aspect of the game.  Your map starts out fairly empty and planets, stars, nebula etc only appear as you find them.  So if you want to make the money by finding the really good trade routes you will have to head out into the unknown.\n\nThe game could benefit from some updated sounds and graphics, but even as it stands, it is a solidly playable game.","October 17, 2014","true","0.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","18","24","2","0"

I like the variety of shipments you can carry from planet to planet. The graphics are great, and run smoothly on a low-end computer. For the price I couldn't turn it down. I like space fighter games, but the "trucking" aspect of it keeps me coming back to this, playing for hours. It like a combination of Moon Breakers and Euro Truck Simulator. I would like to see a little more personality thrown in, like better space station stops. Perhaps a more "Truck Stop" feel to it, or some humor here and there.\nOr just throw on the "Convoy" soundtrack on Winamp and your good.\nExcellent game at the price. Easy to get in to, Lots to explore,   and you don't feel ripped off.","October 10, 2014","true","99.3"," 26 of 43 people (60%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","60","26","43","5","5"

That game was great. I thought the trailer looked half decent, and I glossed over the fact that the graphics were pretty gross. I started the game, created an account, laughed at all the misspelled words. I started to explore the GUI. This was when I barfed a little. Jesus! Okay, okay, okay. Maybe. Just maybe the game plays decent. I saw I had a skill point. I put it into something that said I would get +5% more XP. Cool. I also saw my ship had some weapons already. Alright. I don't want to shop too much before getting into my first battle. I set out. Wow. This looks nasty. I start to mess with the controls. Hmm. How do I shoot? LOL! DID MY GUN REALLY JUST MAKE THAT SOUND? It's a pea shooter. What the ****? Okay. That's pretty awful. Let's go do that mission I picked up back in base. What was I supposed to do again? I can't find it. Let me just go to the waypoint it set up. It took me a bit to find out how to not travel at a snails pace, but that was okay. I encountered some hostiles while en route to the waypoint. One shot of my pea shooter and they made a little dumb blowing up sound. It didn't feel satisfying whatsoever. Eh. My time here is almost done. Lets get to the objective. I get there. Sitting on the waypoint thinking. What. The. ****. Nothing is happening. I look for 2 minutes around the GUI for information. Nothing. I quit. Do you recommend this game?

One day I was bored and decided to give it a try and I liked it. sure it doesnt have the best graphics like elite dangerous but with the easy flying and active devs this game sure is a fun one. The only real problems is that the server is barely populated and some things are a little overpriced (1 map with 3 locations is 3 mil) also some other small ui stuff. Its still fun to accidently get too close to a sun burn up and loose all 1000 of your diamonds or buying a ship in a level 50 territory and flying it all the way back to your level. id give this a thumbs up because I got my monies worth buy for 9 dollers I wouldent buy it maybe for at its current sate id give it a 5$ price mark.
