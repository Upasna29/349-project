"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jad95/recommended/242720/","Jad95","J-ADdiction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jad95/","75 products in account","Very disappointed at this game. MAIET is the worst company to have hold of this game; They ban you for 40 years on an Early Access Beta- Some of these players paid over hundreds of dollars, I know one who's paid over $200 and is banned- because of you getting caught up in a glitch not caused by you - A hacker once ruined the Tesla Shop RNG weapon winning section and glitched it for everyone making them get free rolls for a main prize in the shop - and they call you a hacker afterwards when it was never your fault you got a bunch of weapons from their own game being exploited due to ♥♥♥♥ coding and server control! In addition, they don't care about their players; they treat you like ♥♥♥♥ and only care about money. It's a Pay 2 Win game; blazing weapons that do 10 HP damage over 3 seconds in addition to bullet damage from the shop and have double the stats as the other weapons? Totally not Pay 2 Win. If you are going to play this game, DO NOT INVEST ANYTHING in it. They will treat you like trash and ban you with 0 conflict nor ♥♥♥♥s or apologies given.\n\nOther than that, here are some extra features to make the game good! (Start sensing sarcasm, after all this IS a bad rating):\n\n-P2P Hosting: Amazing, just get a group of 4 people all sitting next to each other, group up, and queue to get the 0 ping host advantage while the other team gets 300+ ping!\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥ room controlling: You get in a match, crash. You finish a match, crash. You find a match, crash. You can't control anything, you have to wait an hour for a match, no one queues in ranked play because of this ♥♥♥♥.\n\n-Unbalanced classes: That's right, I'm throwing out the old Elena complainer here. But here's why: She's a gunslinger, weak at melee and is supposed to die and get caught by an assassin chasing them with melee easily- WAIT A SECOND, NOPE, UNCLE MAIET'S LOGIC THINKS, lets put 30% melee damage resistance and 150% extra melee damage at level 20 on the weakest melee character and make her the best one now! Not only that, lets make her have the ability to outdash spam a melee asassin while being able to fire a 6 shot kill super accurate rifle while in manuevers! Perfect, now she's the best ranged AND melee, AND WITH AN ADDED TWIST, the nade spam! Not only can you non-stop fire the nades, they also stun you, can stunlock if fired non-stop, and each one easily does 100 damage.\nAsassins? My ♥♥♥, I can out asassinate enemy players with my Max, A SHIELD TROOPER.\n\n-♥♥♥♥♥♥ limited campaign mode!: Gunz 1 had a million dungeon quests and made the hard dungeons require a brain for unlocking them a first place, as well as being hard. But Maiet. Maiet, why. Why do you do this. Lets put levels that can be solo-ed and don't even need skill/thinking to finish. Same boss attack patterns, same map and objective, and same enemies and levels. Where's the variety!? Gunz 1 has a better PvE system than yours, and that game is so ♥♥♥♥ing old compared to your just released ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\n-Not convinced yet? WE'LL THROW IN, the Tesla Shop, and limited playing features! (4 characters only, 3 game modes only)\n-Tesla Shop: Get ready, for the best weapons to be won at a 1/200 chance, with 2000 players rolling all for one item at once, and for each roll taking 5 hours to obtain! Unless you choose to pay, $50 for only 10 rolls at a 1/200 chance! It's such a good deal, we'll even throw in a limited edition 6 hours common-tiered timed weapon! Anddddddd Don't forget! This system is so ♥♥♥♥, it got exploited by hackers who got away with hacking, and instead got innocent players- some who paid over hundreds of dollars on this game- banned permanently because they tried to win one weapon, so the next time you try to win a weapon, be careful and dont get banned for 40 years IN AN EARLY ACCESS BETA!\n\n-4 Characters: Make sure to ENJOY the same 2 weapons over and over!\n\n-3 gay modes: Speaking of variety, LET'S PLAY, Team Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch Elimination, and Team Deathmatch timed!\n\nSo folks, get ready, GET READY FOR THE SECOND DUEL- err I mean DEATHMATCH- IN A 4V4 ONLY ROOM which has a 50% possibility to crash with 0 ping hosts you're playing with hosting from Antarctica to make your ping freeeeeeeeze to 500!\n\nSuch an improvement in features compared to Gunz 1. Ohhh man it's just too great to be true.","March 11, 2014","false","121.7"," 1,045 of 1,381 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","045","1","3","86"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoyamiox/recommended/242720/","xoyamiox","Yami","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xoyamiox/","150 products in account","As this game is in  Early-Access  it is still a review that is subject to change when the game releases, There is a server player cap at the moment which they are increasing, but currently if you do manage to log in the game is currently playable. The best part is this is FREE. I've waited over 5 years for this, and il wait as long as it takes for a stable expirience.\n\nAt First Gunz: The Duel was a Third-Person Action game from the humble origins of Free-to-Play gaming\nThe game became a close memory that many of us hold close to our hearts, bringing a unique game from the wave of free-to-play gaming from korea in the 2000's. It provided Fast-Paced gameplay, with a high skill curve due to a glitch in the game that allowed players to execute complex inputs. Mainly known as K-style, it truely provided a "hardcore" expirience due to it's difficulty in execution and strict timing. For those who are unfamiliar with K-style below is a example along with the inputs (There is music so beware),\nThe more difficult imputs are shown later in the video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQpQHTZusiA\n\nNow, Maiet came back to revive this cult classic among many, but with various changes.\n\nBelow is a quick bit/review from my expiriences of trying both the Taiwan server and US server.\n\nOne main factor is  The Removal of K-style . For many this is a  BIG  deal, it was the sole reason why alot of players loved the first game so much. As the game strayed away from it's original intent, Maiet already adressed the issue in interviews regarding the decision on removing k-style. I understand many of you are upset, i was bummed too but im not going to let a crucial change for the better ruin my view on a franchise, if i really want to expirience K-style again there is allways private servers.\n\nThe playstyle of the game is now a tense, fast paced TPS more reliant on using firearms compared to what many were used to advanced attacks with melee weapons. Melee now is very situational.  Another is seperating playstyles into classes instead of a single character.  Although it is a different game, it still preserves the freedom of mobility the first game offered which made it unique. The gameplay is much more focused on run and gun, but it can still be great fun. Simular to another TPS, S4 league, the game's insane pace is still here, with a shiny coat of paint. Getting the timing down and using the enviroment to your advantage still provided great key-mashing fun, such as when chaining dashes while in combat. It is still very easy to die if you make yourself a easy target by just aiming while on the ground, you will just get taken down quickly by easy head shots.\n\nMost games were pretty great to run about and kick ♥♥♥, but when played as a team it can be great fun. Deathmatch sort of reminded me of the good ol days of Quake-styled arena FPS, hectic as hell as you mow foes down and rush for Armor/Ammo spread about the place to sustain your rampage. There is slight inbalances among the game, but for the most part the classes do a great job of seperating playstyles, weaknesses and strengths, and many approches to gameplay.\n\nThe maps are very well designed, balanced with team-tactics in mind with each map having it's own unique feel. There are symetrical maps such as the mansion, big maps to even small closed enviroments that result in a chaotic brawl. But the most striking joy comes from using the map itself to your advantage, which is one of the key hooks of this game that make it unique. Thinking on the fly about every wall to climb, piece of cover, vantage point, object or area to decimate your enemies.\n\nAlthough there is no K-style, there is some "techniques" players have discovered such as Melee animation canceling via jumping to create a stun-lock melee combo or cancelling dash frames by jumping to dash quickly again to move faster than running.\n\nIn terms of how it runs, so far ive had no graphical issues and it runs fine without my FPS dropping below 120(cap) on Max.\n\nI do have one issue with the game's host system, if you have a ping above 80, your gonna have a noticable ammount of lag. If the host is close to you however there are no issues. Dedicated servers may be nice for ranked play later on for a fair fight.\n\nThe class system is intresting, you can't try out the others on a single account without purchase.\nSo make sure you research abit on your class of choice. (Kind of a bummer here, i will admit)\n\nAfter trying out multiple classes on different accounts, each has great pros and cons and your role plays a big part in engagement decisions. For example, a shield trooper(Max) going rampant and simply burning whoever gets close enough to him, while you stay back and just cleanly engage or harass from a distance giving a easy kill. None of the classes really stuck out to me as "OP", you just have to learn how to engage each class. Another new feature related to classes are unique Active/Passive skills that run off a meter gained from drops and actions. It works sort of like a fighter in the sense of a "Super Meter", however when full you enter a powered up stage that allows you to use any of your abilities that drains at a moderate pace over time.\n\nJust like in the first game, there is a PvE mode with a actual story now. While the story isn't gripping it's decent and the art is great. It still retains the same harsh difficulty like the first game in the later stages, but even in the first few missions enemies can cut you down very fast. It almost forces you to play the game in a entirely different style seperate from PvP, staying beheind cover and picking off enemies.\n\nThe overall game itself has a simple yet clean interface, and the game loads quite fast.\na VERY nice feature is, the game contains a Host-selection option in the game, so if there is lag you can pass the host to another player who can improve latency for everyone. There is one big change, the game uses a match-making service based on levels simular to league of legends instead of a server browser. With this, they also added a ranked mode for serious players above level 20. I would very much love to see a custom game option, for battles with friends or for practice or the return of GunZ CTF.\n\nFor players new to this genre, this game is MUCH easier to pick up compared to the first. You just need to get down the idea of thinking outside the box, be unpredictable. Get off the ground and on the walls, and choose your engagements wisely, don't bite more than what you can chew. The first thing to get down is understanding how movement works, practice with wall running, bouncing, dashing. View the map like it's your own playground to freely move how you want, you have the ability to use any surface to your advantage,go wild with your imagination. Don't forget to aim for the head, you do significantly more damage.\n\nIf you ever wanted to play a game as some badass armed with guns and blades while you run on the walls and mow players down, you might want to try this out.\n\nAt this moment it is in Open Beta for western audiences via steam, there is bound to be many issues but i have high hopes for the team to pull this game to greatness. So far they have adressed a severe gamebreaking issue immediatley and provided a solution along with communicating with the community to help polish the game.\n\nOf course since this is in Beta, i will update this once it is out in full-detail.\n\nWill this live up to the legend of the first game?, It's very different but I will say it has ALOT of potential.\n\n\nYou will most likley enjoy this if you like: Monday Night Combat, S4 League, Quake or other classic arena gameplay aspects, Double-tap dash heavy games such as Phantasy Star Online 2, fluid mobility options, dense battlegrounds, team tactics, and fast breakneck online gameplay.","February 17, 2014","true","15.5"," 538 of 731 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","538","731","0","33"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hikumi/recommended/242720/","hikumi","Hikumi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hikumi/","64 products in account","I was an avid player of the first GunZ back then. Actually I still am, in the many private servers available. When GunZ 2 was announced, I had mixed feelings. Many questions popped. Can GunZ 2 be better than GunZ?\n\nThe answer is, neither yes nor no. GunZ 2 is an entirely different game from GunZ, so you really cannot compare the both of them. GunZ 2 is designed with realistic gameplay in mind, so it lacks a lot of the "mechanics exploits" available in the first GunZ game.\n\nIn other words, if you've gotten very used to the controls, mechanics and physics of GunZ, you won't like GunZ 2. But if you started playing GunZ 2 without playing GunZ, chances are you won't mind.\n\nWith that comparison out of the way, I'd say GunZ 2 is a pretty decent game. Graphics are definitely a major plus side over GunZ, but you're talking about years apart between those 2 games. Being a GunZ player, I find myself not used to the new mechanics, but I still think it is a good game.\n\nLike GunZ, you still get PVP and PVE matches. The only drawback thus far is the lack of players. It would be great if you could get a bunch of friends to play together.\n\nNothing much else I can say about this. It's definitely recommended though. It's free anyway, so why not add another third-person shooter to your games library?\n\nHikumi gives this game, a 6 out of 10.","April 26, 2015","true","101.7"," 131 of 160 people (82%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","82","131","160","21","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/auctaway/recommended/242720/","auctaway","auctaway","http://steamcommunity.com/id/auctaway/","97 products in account","Good game with a terrible community. I've played this game since the Steam release, played in most servers/regions, and have seen so many people come and go. The game has been abandoned by the original developers and sold to a company that, so far, has only made sure the servers stay up and running. This, however, does not stop the community from  playing. The good matches that you can get into between legitimate players and games with friends are the only reason I can still enjoy this game.\n\nThe combat is great, movement is fluid, glitches (for the most part) and unintended merchanics add to the gameplay, and good matches can be very thrilling. The game isn't impossible to learn, but many new players make the mistake of thinking this is a melee game. Good movement and aim will get you farther than anything else.\n\nPractice rooms also exist and provide most players with what they need to learn the game, if they are willing to ask. That being said, it is also possible to simply learn the game by just constantly queuing normals and base everything off what you experience in matches. More experienced players in this game often play together, but there are many who solo queue just to balance out the matchmaking. You will fight the same people often, no matter which modes you play, and most people know who each other are.\n\nThe biggest issue is that the game has no anti-cheating measures and the community is filled with players that hack, or are willing to party with those who do. That being said, there's still a good amount of players who play fair. You can still get good games more often than not by arranging premade games between groups or from just queuing, but many hackers in this game go out of their way to ruin the experience for others.\n\nOverall, the game itself is fine, but can take a while to get the hang of. If you have decent aim and learn the movement mechanics, you'll be fine. If you run around trying to melee better players, you won't have much fun. At the time of writing this, I have the most kills in ranked/normal match queue at almost 70,000 and roughly 3,400 hours of playtime. Although a lot of that time is waiting in queue, I have experienced and tried pretty much everything the game has to offer. I hated this game at first and can now say it is the most enjoyable game I have ever played. GunZ 2 is, at the very least, worth trying.","November 3, 2015","true","923.9"," 91 of 109 people (83%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","83","91","109","11","0"

Not because I think it's a bad game, but because the way it's handled.\n\nlotta prollems.\n\nHacking\nHacking's an issue, I don't remember one hack free week of gameplay when I  was into it. I'm sure with all these hack threads in my absence, it's only gotten worse.\n\nUpdates/support\nThis game hardly updates, when it does it's mostly a balance patch, and personally I don't mind, balance patches I think, are a good thing, the prollem is they do it wrong.\n\nAlso, the focus of this game has changed region several times, first in closed beta for korea(totally different game then), then kill it off and bring a new beta to EU(resembling what we have today), then bring the Open beta to the US on Steam, then pull it off steam in EU and sell it to Aeria games which doesn't seem to care about the game in the end as it somehow died there and is now back up in steam in EU I think? I don't even know, AND NOW IT'S IN MALAYSIA!\n\nCash Items\nWhile I would prefer cash items to not exist, and I personally don't think the Tesla system is bad in the sense of earning a weapon, it makes it a real hard sell for people wiling to put money in the game, you're paying, to get a chance at getting a  weapon. You can find yourself spending hundreds to get everything you want.\n\nNetcode\nSo we're still using the Host system. I got to play on the dedicated server in US-West for a while, but not every game that night was on the dedicated server and afterwards I think they just droped it.\n\nWhat's good? Gameplay.\nIt's fast paced, it's intuitive, honestly gameplay alone, it's not that bad, just a few tweaks with the games hit and block stun and melee combat in this game would be great imo, The melee combat is fun, it's just not good. This game does incorporate strategy in Team Elimination mode and it's always great to have a team that works together just right, Ivans can snipe opponents just out of the hallways in Mansion, Elena's can locate any hiding opponents with her E-skill, Renas and Waynes can provide a distraction to assist in kills for their team, very effectively. Yeah, the game really isn't that bad for competitive play, but unfortunately, there isn't much competition and the Host system in this game basically makes one member on either team really hard to kill, and it makes it too easy for them to kill you, so you will have to precede with caution when you fight against the host.\n\nBtw, anyone expecting this game to play like Gunz1 will be disappointed, they're totally different games.\n\n\nConclusion\nI will close my review saying what I said before, I cannot recommend this game, I like it, I've had a lot of fun playing it, but it just doesn't deserve the love that neither I nor the many veteran players that have stuck with it give it today, because maiet just doesn't know what to do, it's like they're throwing the game everywhere just to see who likes their product the most instead of actually working towards making it a truly good product.","February 22, 2015","false","733.8"," 84 of 113 people (74%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","74","84","113","16","0"

Well back to the drawing board for me.\n\nDevelopers Choices\nSeems that alot of people are split on some of the choices GunZ 2 did.\n\nFor one alot of people appreciate how its VAC secured now and that equals alot less hackers or in my opinon 0. In comparison to the Hacking feast that was the first gunz the duel. So great job devs on that choice!\n\nFor two alot of people do not like k style removed, in fact the blowback from what I saw was pretty crazy. Saying things like "they took out the skill of this game" and the like. If you will think about it though how would K style pan out if it was implemented into this game? A tank K styling seems a tad unbalanced especially with a flamethrower.\n\nLobby and Characters\nThe game itself? Pretty fun joining lobbies is pretty simple and I never had to wait above 35 seconds to actually join a game. I felt every class was imbalanced so there is probly balance to the game, its just one of those things where people are good at a certain character they just seem outright OP.\n\nCharacters and Style\nThe characters have a nice differeintation of styles though melee seems a tad similar in all cases except animation. The guns handle pretty well and seemed somewhat balance athough in some situations it feels like one character trumps another. For example the grenade launcher is awfully effective against people who like to use the sniper. The sniper seems effective to people who are tanks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heretocracy/recommended/242720/","Heretocracy","Heretocracy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Heretocracy/","","Extremely fun at times, but ruined by a couple of major issues. Too many flaws for me to recommend.\n\n- Unreliable gambling shop for acquiring upgraded weapons. Under no circumstances should you be required to wait an entire day to attempt to gamble for a weapon with unreasonable odds. Even when maximizing your odds you are unlkely to get a weapon, you can only buy crystals in bulk and hope for the best. If MAIET wants to turn G2 into a cash cow, could they at least make it consistent? Put the blues at 3.99, yellows at 14.99. The people who got lucky from the shop or have hundreds of dollars to waste love it, but nobody else does.\n\n- Bad netcode. Zero attempt at lag compensation. You need to aim where they will likely be by the time your ping reaches the host, rather than aim where the enemies actually are.\n\n- Even worse host & matchmaking system. MAIET is intent on keeping it P2P either because they're unwilling to fund a revamp or they don't realize just how ridiculous P2P is for the region the game is on.\n\n- Lack of progression/direction. Weapon stats are hard to compare, and many of the bars are extremely misleading. Having to datamine to get the actual stats for comparison is unacceptable. Convert the bars to numbers, make the differences between weapons more noticeable and less clearcut as to which one is best for use, and do something to further weapon upgrade progression beyond "Get the green gear, then gamble for a couple days straight and hope you get lucky for the next tier of weapons". Make it so you can buy the blues for gold or USD, or achievements where if you get a certain number of kills with the green weapon, you get the blue version of it, and so on with the yellow version.\n\n- The list goes on. Rena & Max are extremely strong in certain ways but terrible in most others. You need to pay for the other classes. No duel mode. Some cases of bad map design. Almost nobody prefers Time Assault. No custom games. No server browser. Ad nauseum. You get the idea. The game seems to have been released too early.\n\nDon't let my ranting confuse anyone, I love the basic premise of GunZ. The combat, the classes, the campaign, etc. There are a lot of things about this game that MAIET did correctly, I just wish they'd done the majority of it correctly.","April 11, 2014","false","140.7"," 32 of 41 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","32","41","0","1"

The game allows you to create one character with the opportunity to purchase another character slot. If you didn't choose Rena, you already set yourself back 40k as she is 50k to purchase, and the rest are 10k.\n\nServers get full instantly, and there is no queue to let you know what place in line you are in. When you finally get into character selection, it takes a little while to get into the main lobby as well.\n\nThe Lobby is nothing like the the first Gunz: The Duel. Gone is the "Join open game" and the option to create private games (again, this is Beta, it might change later in the stages). A game can only be a max of 4 v 4 which is really strange as you can invite 5 of your friends to a party. When you enter a room, there is no option at the moment to leave the room which is bad because as of writing, if one person in the room does not ready up, the entire room gets stuck in frozen room hell. This means there's no leaving the room and no game starting, and the only way out is by quitting the application which brings us to the login issue mentioned earlier.\n\nActual gameplay has been dramatically changed as well. There is no more "K-style" which is what made the original Gunz so popular. And other styles have pretty much been removed as well. So Veterans to the original game, this is NOT the same. Then again, I haven't played the original Gunz for maybe 3 years now. As mentioned before, there are 4 character classes, Gunslinger, Slient Avenger, Shadow Dancer (new to NA from what I hear), and Shield Trooper. You can kinda guess what each class does if you haven't seen any gameplay videos before. I played Rena, the Shadow Dancer, who is a fast paced dual wield character. The game, when it works smoothly, plays fantastically and feels polished. But if you have a ping of over 200, you'll struggle, and anything over 500 is just a walking dummy. Prepare to die. A lot. I don't know if it's because I'm low level, but it looks like they removed health and armor packs, and grenades from the game. Kinda disappointed by that change.\n\nThere's also a new Campaign mode which tries to tell a story, but being as it's so new, we (my friends and I) jumped right into the action to test out the gameplay. The first mission is made up of a lot of mini rounds, and can get quite difficult if you like to use melee weapons. Try to space out your weapons or else you'll find yourself out of ammo a lot when facing a big mob. Be wary of the red barrels because if your teammate blows them up, you can get damaged as well, and they hurt. Note that when you first start an account, you are given 3 revival coins for use in the campaign. These coins allow you to revive when you are KO'ed during the mission, but these coins are also $2.50 in the shop. Real money, not in game currency, use those coin sparingly if you're cheap. Speaking of the shop, it's pretty brutal. Comparing to other games, the items are a lot of money. Accessaries start at $10, up to $15, and these are PER item. Being F2P, it's understandable that you want to charge money for perks and asthetics, but that is a lot when comparing to say PSN or XBLive that charge maybe $5 per item.\n\nMusic is very true to it's predecessor, and quite enjoyable. Everything starts out quite loud, esspecially if you are wearing headphones, so headphone users, be sure to set it to a likable volume. Sound effects are pretty much the same from the old game as well. Overall, I found the music the best part so far in the game.\n\nPros:\nGameplay when there is little to no lag\nEveryone at the moment is on equal footing (No k-style means no "noob hunting")\nMusic is wonderful\nCampaign is a fresh new element\n\nCons:\nFrozen Room Hell\nBeginning beta mode means huge server lags that happen frequently for now\nNo private rooms, and a max party of 4 even though the room can host up to 8 (4 v 4)\n\nAgain, this review is based on opening day beta and these critiques can be subjected to change by Maiet (please change for the better). I personally think the game has a lot of potential, and can outshine the original Gunz given time, but at the moment, the game is a bit unbearable due to the stockpile of mini issues. For now 6/10, and I'm sure I'm missing elements to nitpick on.","February 17, 2014","false","3.5"," 206 of 364 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","206","364","0","5"

(Original game was just skill + equipment)\nThey added classes.. (Original game you decided your 'class' by what you equipped)\nThey took out K-style and everything associated with it (Advanced animation exploit that added a huge gameplay mechanic)\n\nThe gameplay just feels slower in general as well. Though you can still run on walls and flip around, the level designs don't really encourage it, with many more corridors, uneven surfaces, and smaller areas, it's usually more effective to stay planted on the ground, and play it as a typical 3rd person shooter. Acrobatics are only useful in this game to get away quickly, but serve little use in direct combat. Unlike the original game which feature larger levels with alot of open spaces and the acrobatics were used for getting around quickly, and mixed in with combat fluidily due to the nature of the gameplay and levels. In this sequel useing acrobatics in combat just causes a mess due to the close proximity you always tend to have to other players.\n\nCompared to the first game there is a slight delay to every action, that as a diehard fan of the original, makes Gunz2 just painful to play.\n\nIt's free, and it's a full experience. It's a quality game that you may enjoy.\nAs a fan of the original, I can't recommend this, it feels watered down, generic, and generally boring.","June 22, 2014","false","4.8"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","1"

Putting the server issues aside, the matchmaking system is horrible in the sense that I am at the moment level 2, and i'm matched up with level 10+ clans. This reiteration of GunZ puts almost no emphasis on guns, instead focusing almost completely on melee combat. The gunslinging class is helpless against every melee class, and the only counter to melee classes is the tank class. All melee weapons will stun-lock you, and some even have an AOE effect where a melee hero can easily take out two or even three teammates in close proximity. It's not unheard of for an entire team to empty their clips on a melee class just for them to rush behind you and take each of you out.\n\nThis game looks great on paper, and is visually a big step up from the original GunZ, but until classes are fairly balanced, this might be one game you're going to want to stay away from.","February 21, 2014","false","4.2"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","26","40","0","2"

Instead of being bound by classes, you were free to experiment and customize your character as you see fit. Your main limitation being weight, your loadout would usually be quite balanced. If you wanted to carry a rocket launcher, heavy machine guns, and a sword for maximum DPS you might have to head out without armour, for instance! You could go full melee, full ranged, or anything inbetween. It was a beautiful system that encouraged you to try everything it had to offer.\n\nAs time went on, players also adopted K-Style. Using animation canceling, players could perfect a complex series of keypresses that'd allow for seamless traveling across any given map - and unrivaled combat prowess limited only by a K-styler's skill level and dedication. Both K-Stylers and the more average vanilla-gameplay style worked hand-in-hand and made for amazing and intense matches.\n\nQuesting was a bit confusing, but entertaining and challenging all the same. So much freedom, new gametypes and updates every so often, it was fun while it lasted. Near the end of its life, GunZ the Duel introduced an almost MOBA-style gametype that allowed players to get better gear than the real-money store offered. This killed the sales and "forced" them to shut the original GunZ down before GunZ 2: the Second Duel was released. It seemed like the timing was a little too perfect and on-purpose, but I digress.\n\nGunZ 2: the Second Duel changed some things up.\n\nMovement was made to be more accessible. They moved away from the steep learning curve of K-Style, opting for a system where you can run up walls and get around with but a few taps of the spacebar. This seems alright. Where I think it begins to fall apart, is the addition of classes. For me, this destroyed much of the experimentation and customization that made GunZ so balanced and fun. With these classes, at times it almost seems like a rock-paper-scissors scenario. Everything feels clunkier than the original GunZ. The first game had very tight controls that were beyond responsive. It was built to be that way. This one isn't as quick and generally feels a little sluggish and off for one used to the old style of gameplay.\n\nNowadays, the servers for this game are barren... With no community to even play with, this game simply needs to be avoided entirely at this point. I'd say give it a try if you were still interested, but I can't even offer that much anymore. Just avoid it.\n\nIf you're like me, and very much enjoyed the original GunZ, look into something called Freestyle GunZ. It is a fan-run version of the original game with a bunch of fan additions. It isn't the real deal, but it's the best we've got now and has a decent playerbase. Way easier to find a match there than the mess that is GunZ 2: the Second Duel. Old veterans and those new to the series alike won't find what they're looking for here.","December 30, 2015","false","4.3"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Wait, you changed... WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?\n\nAfter long years waiting, we finally have the second iteration of "GunZ: The Duel" on our hands, and it's bitter sweet. On one hand, it bring us that K-Style, fast-paced pump action that we all knew and loved and the ever so memorable maps! But there are too many "deviations" from the original that keep this game on its predecessor's shadow: gone is the free-reign customization you had with your character, opting now to offer you only classes with very limited customizable options.\n\nThe addition of special moves, like a Hurricane Kick and a Deathslash are cool concepts on paper, but take A LOT out of the skill based game that was GunZ. Who likes to be one-shot with an uninterruptible special move from behind? Only with Headshots, the most sublime art in GunZ, do I condone one-hit deaths.\n\nAND DON'T GET ME STARTED ON MATCHMAKING! WHAT MATCHMAKING?\n"Are you new to the game? Are you an old veteran of the original game, but have already forgot how to play the game? Here, go play with level 20 characters that kill you with three hits from a sword-cancel Butterfly and reload shot."\n\nAll in all, it's a great game. If it was a totally new experience, or If you never had the luck to touch the original GunZ, I would recommend this game. But with the memory of the original still imprinted in my mind, I find it lackluster, and do not recommend it for the OG GunZ player.","January 3, 2015","false","1.0"," 37 of 63 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","37","63","3","0"

GunZ was a fast paced action TPS that involved either great amounts of skill, or great amounts of panicing. That game was fast paced, from the start to finish of any match.\n\nMany advanced players would be sporting their respective fighting styles, and many newer players will be resorting to classic methods of run and gun. GunZ presented many ways to tackle problems; to rush in with your sword and come out like a bad ♥♥♥, or have a heated gun fight and blow some lead into your opponent.\n\nGunZ truly was a to the book, fun game. And here we have, GunZ 2 being released. Now at it's current stage, GunZ 2 is very much in it's early access/ alpha stage, so this review may not be valid if it so changes drastically, or proves me wrong in the future.  Granted, from the time I have played so far, here is what I have gathered.And this may all well just be an extended first impressions, so take it with a grain of salt.\n\nFrom the get go, the first thing I noticed, was the uniquely different art style that GunZ 2 has. It's a lot less, "dark" shall I say than GunZ 1 in my opinon. But GunZ 2 does have slightly better graphics than GunZ 1, only, it would take a lot of time getting used to it. The style of GunZ 2 kind of reminds me of S4 league, not in any terms of art style, but just how they present their characters ,and how they move about and battle. But it just may be me. Either way, it's definetly a lot different than the original GunZ, but new players of the franchise probably won't get this feeling of disconnect from GunZ 2, which is a good thing.\n\nAnother thing I notice, is that the movements of the characters seem a lot less fluid. Granted this is probaly due to the Alpha effect, from the dashing and wall jumping, it just all feels a little clumpy, and even when I'm running around and hitting enemies. The epicness of actually landing my awesome combos in GunZ 1 isn't as evident in GunZ 2 at this current stage. Rather, landing a simple basic melee combo pretty much obliterates anyone and empting out maybe half your clip destroys anyone. Trying to land any fancy techniques could easily get yourself killed by an opponents team mate spraying you down. A very common experience I had was trying to chain a basic melee combo and then get gunned down and literally stunned since my opponent would then trap me in a melee combo himself and I would have no chance of escaping. At least in GunZ 1 I would have had some chance to escape since the basic melee combo didn't horribly trap me in place while taking all my hp away.\n\nOther than some combat issues and some overall atmosphere feel, as GunZ 2 does not feel at all like GunZ 1, i admit it was still really fun to play. It was fun beign put back in the GunZ universe and to experience the fast paced TPS battles I once had. As a near end note, GunZ 2 also brings a lot of RPG elements into play.\n\nThe leveling system is actually used in conjunction to skills unlocked in actual combat, gear is now upgradable and has a durability system, and your loadout is preset towards certain gender locked characters during character creation. The RPG elements just seem like a little bonus feature and not much to fawn over, the real thing I want to see is for MAIET to bring back the good old GunZ feel back for us.\n\nAt the moment, GunZ 2 does not feel like a sequel, if I stretch it hard enough I could call it that, but it strayed so far from it's predessor in my opinion. Honestly, If they can improve on combat mechanics, combat play, fluid and actually useful movement plays (The dash is pretty much useless since it gets you nowhere, I've chased down plenty of people with my sword while they dashed away like it was nothing. Also, gunning them down with the dash was a piece of cake as well. Wall hanging was a nice thing to have, but it was pretty much just there for stealth players, I'd like them to incorporate a way to be able to shoot off walls. That would be an improvement. And don't get me started with wall running) then I think that GunZ 2 could be an amazing game.\n\nBut alas GunZ 2 is still in EARLY ACCESS (At the time of this review/first impression) So I will give MAIET the benefit of the doubt and press on. For all of you who haven't tried it out yet, I honestly will recommond it, give it a little taster, at least for a little while, even if you hate it later.","February 24, 2014","true","18.0"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","1"

I didn't play this game much to be honest and in fact, this review came late: I played this game last year when it first launched.\n\n1. As before, ping plays a big role, and at that time, I was playing in Australia. The drawback was that my network was quite terrible and the fact that I could not connect to servers outside Oceania meant that I could not play with some of my friends from other games. Some of the "solutions" were to use VPN, but honestly it was a terrible mix anyway.\nComparison to GunZ the Duel: It didn't matter where you are playing from because you are all connected to the same server (official servers = ijji and Aeria back then, or others would be private servers). Old GunZ 1: Second Duel 0\n\n2. Movements are bloody rigid.. HONESTLY. It just feels like a simple run and shoot game. It helps if you have a spray weapon in case of you or your opponent lagging, Melee is now worse...but then again a gun should always win vs melee...\nComparison with old GunZ: Precisely because movements can be exploited, it makes the character movement more fluid.  It makes the game REALLY FAST-PACED, not to mention many finger-breaking moments (I'm sure everyone knows what I mean) as compared to the sequel. Old GunZ 2: Second Duel 0\n\n3. Storyline. Now this is where the Second Duel sort of triumphs over the previous game because the previous game has no particular storyline. Old GunZ 2: Second Duel 1\n\n4. Customisation. The Second Duel is all about classes. You can't configure your weapon loadout a lot, so if you picked a class you don't like, you gotta start over.\nComparison with old GunZ: When you first create your character, it allows you to select "classes" with different loadout. However, you can customise it to something out of the ordinary, meaning players have more freedom to explore the choices they are best suited to. Did I also mention you can also add elemental colours and attributes to your melee weapon? Old GunZ 3: Second Duel 1\n\nOverall... I plead Steam to host the old GunZ: The Duel, please!","October 24, 2015","false","5.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","16","26","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unialot/recommended/242720/","Unialot","Unicorn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Unialot/","516 products in account","Okay now that I can actually get into the game, it's time to give it a fair review.\n\nGunZ 2: The Second Duel is the successor to the fast-paced third person shooter GunZ, which was by far one of the best experiences I've had with shooters. GunZ is a very unique game which requires good positioning, dodging, and accuracy. Now with GunZ 2, there are many changes from the first game, both good and bad.\n\nBefore I begin, I am neutral on the removal of K-Style, I believe that it both helped and killed the game, creating elitism where people were making "smurfs" and just completely obliterating the new players. I believe it is what killed the community, and it was a decent idea by Maiet to remove this ability. However, one of the best parts of K-style was the incredible pace that your character was able to move at. It was absolutely amazing to be able to slash shot from wall to wall while shooting people. It gave such an "epic pro" feeling. Also, it made sword fights and 1v1s amazingly fun, where it was a competition of whoever could position themselves best, and making one single mistake lead to your demise. In the end, I believe that Maiet's decision to get rid of Kstyle certainly does improve the community and help new players ease in, while also reducing the speed and pacing of fights. Now time to carry onto what I believe they did well and didn't do well in.\n\nWhat I believe they did well with.\n\n1, The gun play and accuracy is much, much, MUCH better and smoother than GunZ was, where in GunZ  it was only viable to use shotguns and SOMETIMES pistols due to the difficulties with aiming with other weapons (Renards cough).\n\n2. Sort of branching off of the first point, the amazing amount of diversity in weapon choice. With the new class system that Maiet created, you can now choose certain weapon kits that fit your playstyle. For example, if you feel that you want to be a tank initiator, Shield Trooper is your man. I feel this is one of the redeeming features for why GunZ 2 is amazing, since in the predecessor, everyone was using the exact same weapon kits with little variety (Maybe someone will use a breaker 7 instead of 8 or something...)\n\n3. The pace of the game. In addition with GunZ 2's new lobby match making system, you're going to be able to join and finish a game within 5 to 10 minutes no problem due to the extremely fast pace that it moves in, which I believe is what makes GunZ amazing. Who wants to play a slow game anyways?\n\n4. The leveling system. I don't know if I'm remembering correctly or not, but it felt like MILLENIUMS to level up in GunZ, it surely took me a while to be able to wear my sexy brown trench coat..\n\n5. The Interface and lobby. It feels that one of Maiet's focuses was to make some quality of life changes to social aspects of the game, where now you can have tabs to chat with friends and your clan, with a public lobby where you can chat up and meet new people!\n\n6. PvE! I wasn't much of a PvE'er in GunZ, but from what I remember it was pretty decent, but needed those materials in order to increase the difficulty, which I personally did not enjoy. With GunZ 2 now, we have an entire campaign mode for PvE, which includes difficult bosses and hordes of enemies. I'm currently on season 1 (I don't know if it goes further?) but I'm assuming that there are more seasons to come :)\n\n7. Tumbling. Nobody, and I mean nobody, liked tumbling. Theres always that moment where you trying to slash shot while dashing and accidently tumble into 3 people just waiting for you with rocket launchers. The removal of tumbling is definitely a good move by Maiet, it improves the viability of using ranged weapons and sets melee weapons down a peg. But maybe by too much.\n\n\nWhat I feel they didn't do as well in\n\n1. One of the parts of the game that I am most disappointed with personally is the dashing. The speed of dashing is worlds different compared to the first game. In GunZ, you were able to dash like crazy, moving at an extremely fast pace which increased the difficulty of getting hit, and hitting your target. This is what made GunZ so much fun for me, the fast paced action where you need spot on accuracy in order to win, while also managing your character's location and trying to dodge according to where they shoot.\n\n2. The synergy between your weapons! Where is it?! GunZ is meant to be a fast pace shooter, which means that it is essential to be able to synergize your attacks and be able to react quickly to the situation. In the predecessor GunZ, you were able to switch weapons at extreme speeds, where people often used two shotguns, two pistols, or a mix of the two, to switch between the guns to achieve a faster firing rate. I think that it was what made it so important to choose which weapons you want to use. Now in GunZ 2, when you're in a fire fight, you're basically stuck to using one weapon until the enemy needs to reload or you are able to run and hide. This is extremely offputting to me, and it gives off the "Spray and Pray" kind of play style that I personally hate.\n\n3. Stagger, stagger, stagger, stagger. I am Ivan. But seriously, the stagger given off from melee weapons is just ridiculous. It now makes it so that you are screwed once somebody is within melee range of you because of the extremely slow weapon swap speed, and how it cuts out your attack animation completely. I feel that it should let you continue shooting, but making your screen shake so they don't just get nuked in the face once they get near you.\n\n4. Wall climbing. I personally enjoyed the epicness of running against the wall and shooting at somebody down the hallway in Mansion. However, with the removal of slashing the wall to climb, it seems now you're in such a vulnerable situation if you ever want to climb the walls. It certainly screams out "SHOOT ME IN THE ♥♥♥" while you climb to the next floor in Mansion. I believe the system of dashing + slashing up the wall should have stayed.\n\n5. Lobbies. I personally HATE the CoD matching making system where you are simply randomly placed with other players with no choice. This is limiting the freedom that us players have by not allowing us to have our own rules and what not (Attack and Defend anybody?). It also means that... gulp... random host. I'm sure that if any of you have been playing for at least an hour or two, you have run into that one extremely laggy host who uses it to their advantage. I'm talking about that time where everyone is at 999 ping, teleporting everywhere, while the host is racking up kills faster than an AC-130 in CoD.\n\n\n6. Last but not least, the lacking of character customization. By this I mean different character faces, facial features, body types, etc. I expected a greater amount of customization out of GunZ 2, where you can change your features similar to how most MMORPGs do it. This is probably not one of their highest priorities, but it would certainly be nice to look different than the thousands of the other people playing Rena.\n\n\nTo wrap this up, I think that overall GunZ 2 is an improvement from GunZ, and it feels that it will stay alive for much longer, as long as Maiet continues to update the game with new game modes. I'm really hoping they bring back a swords only game mode, and introduce a community workshop to allow new costumes to be introduced :)","February 19, 2014","true","28.4"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","1"

Now I believe most server errors are gone and people can finally join the game. I've been playing for quite a long time and this game is incredibly fun. Veteran players of the first Gunz will not experience the same moves and same mechanics, this is a completely different game but, however, I believe there will be new awesome moves aswell just like the first one.\nThe class concept is simple: Every class is overpowered. They are equally overpowered so it's balanced. I don't believe people will start using only one class anytime soon (Maybe most people will choose Ivan, idk why).\nThe game modes are really cool. They are:\nTeam deathmatch Self explanatory. Two teams of 4 players battle against each other, you respawn when you die and the team that reaches a score of 450 first wins.\n\nTeam Elimination 5 rounds where players wont respawn. If you die you have to wait for the next round. It's cool because you end up being careful on where to go and people will stick together to make a good team. And a team with different classes will always be better than one with only one class.\n\nTeam Assault I like this one most! Unfortunately it's got only one map. It's pretty much an attack x defense mode where the attackers have to make their way through 3 gates, destroying them with bullets or swords while the defensors have to stop the other team. At the end of the round the roles will switch: attackers will defend and defenders will attack.\nIt's cool because people are pretty much obligated to work as a team to make their way through the given time (10 minutes) and hold the other team from doing it in less time than your team.\n\nThe classes, as I mentioned, are equally overpowered. I say that because each one got an special effect or damage that will get people on their nerves. I haven't tried all of them yet, I'm going for it as soon as possible but I assure there's no best class in this game.\n\nIf you're smart enough to know what "Early Access" stands for and you like GunZ you should definitely try.

The animations are good, the map design is very decent (ignoring a few flaws of a young game), and maps from the Original GunZ make their way into this iteration too. The campaign is a good challenge too, despite very little reason to play it.\n\nBut then there's the Cons:\nStunlocking is too easy to accomplish as some classes, basically guaranteeing the lockee's death.\nAnd then theres the community, rather small at the moment, but currently full of people who exploit the stunlocks, and spawn kill extensively, ruining the fun for the people who just want to play the game, not tryhard it.\n\nApart from these small issues, its a fine game, and i recommend it.","May 4, 2014","true","16.2"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","0"

The sniper rifles don't deal nearly enough damage for the amount of aim required to use them effectively, and the sheild protects way too much of the body at the sides. Another problem with the game is the complete inability to defend yourself if you get hit by two melee hits. Another issue, is the level up system. Abilities don't work until you restart the game at times. Some of the damage tables are silly, and one character is rediculously overpowered in gladiator mode.

I played the first game and loved it but had to stop due to the amount of hackers that flooded it unfortunately. When I heard a 2nd game was being made I was pretty ecstatic knowing one of my all time favorite 3rd person shooter was making a reboot. Unfortunately... I was dissappointed.\n\nBefore I begin, this is a side-by-side comparison review between Gunz1 and Gunz2. For those of you who have NOT played Gunz1, then you will have NO idea what i'm talking about and won't know what I felt when playing this game. Though I do bring up other points that are a "by itself" case in terms of Gunz2 gameplay but that is up to you to decide if you agree with me or not.\n\nWithout further ado, here is my Gunz2 review:\n\n\nFirst off... classes... WHY?\nIt's sad to say this game tried to mimic the currently famous/mainstream shooters like COD and BattleField by introducing classes that uses specific weapons and has different playstyles. To make it worse, if you want to play the other classes you need to proceed to buy them. Just... no.\nGunz1 was fun because you could buy w/e weapon you wanted, try out different combinations and play it your own way.\nWith the class system it chooses FOR you limiting your playstyle and forcing you to either make a new account or pay to play another character if you get bored with the one you've been grinding for who knows how long.\n\nOh wait did I say grinding? yep... there is a level system in this game.\nEvery other level or so you unlock skills that are a necessary core playstyle for your class such as... I don't know... being able to save yourself mid-air when an enemy knocks you up which was a clear distinction in Gunz1 if you were going against a bad player or not.\nThis also brings me back to playing the other characters... oh boy now you got to level THEM up to.\nI wanted to play a 3rd person shooter and go crazy, not grind and be forced to level my character up to access his abilities to fully experience the CORE of the gameplay.\nGunz1 had a level system but each level unlocked new weapons for you to try out, NOT necessary skills.\n\nThis brings me to playstyle itself.\nI've reached level 6 before stopping (reasons which i'll explain later) and noticed a distinct play style everyone incorporates. Rush the enemy, knock them down using melee combos, then proceed to fill them with lead using your gun.\nYou see in Gunz1 most of the time you did NOT see a gun pop out unless it was a quickdraw. Most of the time you would see people flying around everywhere with their swords out using wall-slash climbing techniques or butterfly sword fights. Melee is completely obsolete in this game other than to do what I've mentioned above and to use your .... *ughs* ultimates/active abilities.\n\nOh boy... lets bring in some abilities that takes about the same skill level of a 13 year old targetting a mob in World of Warcraft and give it 1-shotting capabilities. That's right folks. Once you reach 3 bars in your power guage, you get access to a specific class based ability that pretty much 1-shots or gets close to it if you land it... which is pretty much easy since every single melee hit manages to stagger you and the game isn't as fast paced as it used to be.\n\nSpeaking of fast paced... this game is slow as BALLS compared to Gunz1. Seriously, they literally dumbed down the gameplay for people of all skill levels can somewhat compete with one another. When the point of a game is to try and out play your opponent in terms of wit and playstyle and you dumb that down so there is hardly any learning curve and the combat system is generic and repetitive, you get Gunz 2.\n\nOh and what a way to complement the slow gameplay with laggy servers...\nLaggy servers that are chosen beforehand in a system where a "host" is designated to provide a specific region that best optimizes the rest of the players internet stability. Just as warning, that internet stability is nonexistant 3 out 5 times where hosts are constantly being shifted to different players due to the horrible connectivity issues.\n\nPay to Win.\nYep folks, this is a pay to win game. Gear is HEAVILY weighted in this game where a gear difference is enough to shift a balance dramatically to one team. For example: if you were to have a stand off with the enemy without moving, the person with better gear WILL kill you before you even break his shield. In this aspect, outplaying the enemy means nothing since he becomes a versatile one-man army being able to TAKE hits and dish out twice as much damage than you can.\n\nBut wait, there's more!\nThe queue system and lobby system, I admit, is one of the better ones I've seen that incorporates it. It's fast, it's clean, and gets you in a game without any trouble.\nHOWEVER, the matching system is broken to all hell. There is no brackets in this game, as far as I can tell, and you WILL get paired up with people 2x, 3x, 4x, 5x + level than you. This is the main reason I quit the game because I constantly got paired with high leveled people that HAD the gear, the ABILITIES for the class, UPGRADES to their armor, and so forth. It was entirely one sided in most matches I've played since there is always a high level in yours or the enemy's team.\n\nI'm pretty sure there are more points I missed but constantly thinking about Gunz 2 just keeps filling me with dissappointment and anger.\n\nAs a disclaimer, this review is purely OPINION. That's right folks... OPINION. So if you get butthurt because you enjoyed the game and I didn't then keep your comments to yourself. If there are people out there who do find this game fun then good for you. I'm not bashing the people who play this game, I'm just stating my opinion on why this game could have been better and what they changed that should not have been changed in the first place.\n\nWell that's that. I hope my review sheds some light on w/e woes you have.","March 9, 2014","false","8.8"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

In addition to that, there are hackers.\nThe game has been dead since its release; it is hard to find a decent match with the available matchmaking option, and if you do, you end up in a DUEL, most likely a 2v2, where your opponents will have at least a dozen levels over you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/durtynam/recommended/242720/","durtynam","TheNaughtyNarwhal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/durtynam/","141 products in account","GunZ 2: The Second Duel, is a fast paced 3rd person FPS showdown between a selection of four different classes with unique skills, weapons, and skillplay. Although the game is currently in beta, many problems exist with achievements, the host system, and broken mechanics. Despite the joy that comes out of playing GunZ 2, I have concluded that it would be better not to play this game. The reasons I mentioned - particularly miniscule at first glance - are the core reasons why the game has such a small community and unsatisfactory results/reviews. Despite a new sense of intense gameplay that can be derived from the game, with no indication of future success or plans, the time spent on the game will most likely be wasted. I am not downgrading the game far enough that I would call it unplayable; however, unless dynamic changes are in store for the future, this game will disappear. (This may change over time, but how closely related the mechanics and systems are of the korean version, I doubt any plans that fixes any of the above issues will come of it.)","March 25, 2014","false","15.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

One of my personal gripes is that at times feels spammy, by this I mean it is tad of a button masher feeling more like a 3d Street Fighter where you can move around the map, but with less of the charm and skill of the Street Fighter series.\nThere is also a lacking of block abilities many attacks cannot be blocked or doged which makes for quite some frustration.\n\nThere are some good point to the combat, for instance the wall running ability is pretty much flawless feeling insanely smooth, there are some minor issues with the dash feature in conjunction with the wall run both graphically and functionally.\nOn that same point it is to be noted that the dash is one of the main elements of batted, by default you have to double tap the W key to increase your movement speed, this can be used to do the only effective dodging in the game.\n\nOnto the weapons, these themselves are quite fun but to use any weapon aside from the defaults you must craft them with a generation system, by which you use ores gained from completing achievements in game in the Tesla Shop, unlike a normal system you cannot craft the weapons that you specifically want you must input the ores into a machine which then pops out a random wep.\n\nOne last thing to do with the gameplay, K Style was all but removed from the game. Granted it wasn’t really supposed to be in the first owing to the fact it was a series of glitches but after seeing the number of people who enjoyed using it, would have been nice to see MIAT bring it back in some form.\n\nI shall move onto the graphics and playability levels:\nThe Graphics are not great even on the best settings, yet they are drastically different on high than the low setting which is in all honesty an affront to the eyes.\nThere is a major problem with the fact that until you engage in a match you are unable to set the game to fullscreen mode.\nGunz 2 lacks the playability level for me, I started out loving the game but after about 20 hours it just started to feel like a pointless button mashing grind.\nNot too many other features to discuss but this review is getting long so I shall cut it short.\n\n*Update as of Jan 28 2015*\nMAIET has not patched anything, there remain constant hit detection issues, graphical problems, a lack of dedicated servers, infinate z glitches etc.\nSince the introduction of Rose there hasn't been anything really done to the game, there are still very few maps and its become hard to even play the game.","May 24, 2014","false","43.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game is fast so your reaction needs to be as quick as a snake, but at the same time, you have to be good enough to kill an hawk from below.\n\nOnly 4 vs 4, but that's more than enough. Maps are small so there's like 0 downtime. An other game where you don't want to feed the enemy or you will be the reason for the loss of your team. In melee, it's more like a fighting game since you can also block and use special abilities to pin your opponents down. Cool none automated combos.\n\nI expect to see a greater amount of players duking it out in the near future with larger maps too,\n\nMy only problem with this game is the balance.\nThe big guy is overpowered with his flamethrower and you can't even knock him down while he spit fire. I think this is unfair and it automatically makes him the best character in melee and he don't even have to use his melee weapon. That character is as buffed as Sylvester Stallone and he is just as agile as the other characters combined with the fact that he is more resistant and he may block with his tower shield for ever.","May 2, 2014","true","15.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","1"

It cost 5$ for 12 coins. It cost 7 coins for a roll. And the chances are slim that you will get a item that is permament. That right you are mostlikely going to get a item that last 6 hours from the time you got it. So if u want the full affect of your $2.50~ item you have to play for 6 hours non stop. It will not be ther tomorrow. Out of the 15 items i got in the premium shop [Gave me extra coins cuz i did the BETA] i got zero permament items. Granted i did it before the ODDs were below 100/200. But no one told me to do that at the time. The game did not explain what the system was either. I had to browse the fourms and find a comment someone said. So i "Gambled" 2 more rolls and made shure it was below 100/200 and i still got 6 hours items. Now the derps defending the game and saying 70/200 [never happens].\n\nThe game mechanics are ok. Needs a bit more scripts to be fluid and not a chance this will happen. Some characters are OP with stagger lock abilities. And its not yet supported by Steams Anti Cheat system. I loved the origional more because of the shop, levels, weapons, game modes.\n\nThe k-style people are crying about was a unintentional programming.

I literally fell out of my chair when I saw this game announced for real. I waited patiently for it and finally when it was released I quickly downloaded it and nearly had a nerdgasm...but it was not to be.\n\nI live in Jamaica and according to what I read, this game uses some sort of P2P connection which is more affordable than say hosting a server in various countries. This however has led to my game client being unable to even find 1 multiplayer game. I literally let it run as long as it could possibly run (I think it was well over 300 seconds) and it said it was unable to find a game in any of the 3 game modes. Surprisingly enough I saw between 70 and 100 users online at the time so I figured finding one would be a breeze. But no, it couldn't find one.\n\nThe one time I had a little bit of enjoyment in the game was when I created a Mission lobby and after about 10-15 minutes 1 person joined and we played a little bit with a few minor setbacks. He had been searching for a game forever and was unable to find one either. He was from another Caribbean island also. Never have I ever played a game that I am unable to join up with other users. How am I to give this game a proper rating if I can't even create a multiplayer lobby and play by myself?\nI'm really not interested in the story, just give me the ability to play with some people, that's all.","May 16, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I have nothing to say about this travesty of a game....other than the fact that it's not good. Not good at ALL! There are so many problems I don't even know where to start! So I'll just list them as I go along.\n\n1. The game's coding is straight up sh*t, honestly, I've been in a match where a guy exploited a glitch that allows him to get a vantage point without anyone being able to hit him, and the spawning is so bad that players literally camp where you just spawned.\n\n2. The single player campaign is completely worthless, all you do is 1. Shoot guys, 2. Shoot guys, 3. Shoot guys, and possibly 4. shoot up a boss. THAT'S IT! Repetitive and boring, and the AI is SO dumb! Some even literally run against a wall!!\n\n3. PVP connection.....oh GOD the connection, there wasn't a single, I repeat, NOT A SINGLE time I wasn't lagging in a match, and guess what, other's didn't have the disadvantage and they end up killing the laggy players with 300+ ping while they only have 20- ping\n\n4. The weapons are either not powerful enough, or overpowered to the point of straight up SPAMMING and the ammo runs out too quickly, so chances are, you're probably screwed without ammo\n\n5. The game is suffering from MicroVolts-Character-Syndrome, meaning if you want to play as another character, you have to play over 100,000 in game currency to play as the character, and even then, there's still the chance that you'll be screwed because of the glitch I told you about eariler.\n\n6. The characters themselves are unbalanced, and the game is too stupid to balance out the teams! Seriously, there was even a team full of sniper dudes and another with two demolition ladies, a minigun guy and a cowboy, guess who won?\n\nAll in all, ♥♥♥♥ game, nothing is redeemable about this.","May 18, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Early access and they've gone straight to p2w. You don't stand much of a chance against anyone in a match with more than one level 10+ in a match because all the abilities you don't have yet don't let you. If you decide to download it and play, stay away from Gladiator Mode unless you're willing to put it a decent amount of hours grinding for Refined Ore to get a decent sword, or willing to pay for swords.

As the game chooses a host for the game lobbies, there is very little lag if you are hosting which is good. The amount of customisation is astounding with choices ranging from a curved sword to a straight one. Important notifications are never missed as they scroll across your screen obstructing your view of everything else that is unimportant i.e everything else so you will always know when there is a maintenance which happens very often as MAIET clearly knows how to manage servers and strive to achieve the best game performance they can by constantly taking the servers down to fix the very few issues the game constantly has. The game feels more responsive than a blind, deaf and crippled elderly about to kick the bucket which is really impressive and certainly a next generation improvement. The death animation is amazing as it feels painful to watch, a once lively body suddenly a corpse ragdolling across the map because of a few invisible bullets is incredible. MAIET must have done a really great job as the servers are constantly full which indicates people want to play this game. The only thing that I could possibly criticise is the title of this game, GunZ 2. This implies it is a sequel to another game but I do not believe that this is actually a sequel to anything. If you didn't get the major tone of sarcasm, this game is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing let down and should not carry the name 'GunZ'. You don't have to be good at this game to be good, you just have to be host. The new physics engine so good the game actually breaks and becomes unplayable, wall running is so easy now, you can run through the walls. MAIET, how the ♥♥♥♥ to you down grade like this. Low skill cap as any 'special' moves require ZP and just one press of a button to instantly kill anyone infront of you or escape certain death because you got caught. MAIET takes pride in GunZ 2's biggest strength being freedom of movement, yet this is clearly a very weak point as movement is choppy and too static because they tried too hard in removing animation cancelling. Wisdom comes from age and experience comes from time and work, a few (hundred) years developing this and MAIET managed to become ♥♥♥♥♥ier and the work they have produced is basically just every amateur TPS out there with a few 'perks'. MAIET, did you spend a good year or two perfecting the breast jiggle physics or something? High speed, hard to detect explosions in a small area is a great idea as well as having a stealth skill that takes too long to use on the spot and no where to set up. Also melee in this game is incredibly unbalanced and it is much easier to 'trap' someone now. Any settings higher than low is a party bag full of seizures and frame drops although it does look quite nice, for a bunch of  pictures. Server stability is an issue, the game uses a player hosting system. How the ♥♥♥♥ do you manage to do this? It takes a lot of skill to be this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to make a game this ♥♥♥♥, only skill the game has hey? I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that MAIET's offices are filled with spastics, wouldn't be surprised if I was right. Logic and balance sorely lacking, why are there snipers in maps that are small and crowded and don't get me started on the grenade launchers on the most overpowered class, the ♥♥♥♥♥ wielding, noob tubing, jack-of-all-trades, master of everything, spraying ♥♥♥♥ bag. That is not a character for a game, it's a character for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porno. You might argue that it's still early access and beta and all this testing ♥♥♥♥ but this has been in development for 10 years or so and has been out in Korea and Europe for how long? And it's only at this stage. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing work. MAIET is a bunch of cheap porno watching, spastic, call of duty loving, trash of trash ♥♥♥♥ for brains, sub-humanoid idiots that failed their lives. MAIET didn't make GunZ good, the players did and now since they've limited that, they have this, which is less than nothing. " ... excited to release and operate online game service on our own for the first time. " - CEO of MAIET. Mate you guys haven't done ♥♥♥♥ on your own, this ♥♥♥♥ uses a user hosting system and it still lags.

This is practically a completely different game than the first one even though it may look very similar. There are classes in GunZ 2 which I didn't like at first but now that I have 300+ hours sunk into it I have changed my mind. Each class brings something different from the abilities you unlock as you level to 20 to the weapons available to that specific class. There are currently 5 classes and at least 1 more coming. The game isn't without it's flaws; the Tesla Shop feels awkward for a free-to-play game and still feels almost border-line pay-2-win despite the recent buff to the rate at which you aquire the currency used to purchase Tesla Shop gear as it'll take the average player a few months to deck out your character in full Blazing/Lightening equipment. It's not a huge advantage but it's enough to force you to stay out of Ranked until you get a set yourself. Each class feels incredibly unique and appeals to different play-styles. As a beginner, you'll probably want to pick up either Elena, Max, or Ivan as they have the lowest skill-ceiling (least amount of effort in order to do decently) but in the hands of a skilled player they're all balanced fairly well.\n\nThe developers have pushed through a lot of criticism early in beta and have been working hard to bring out more content and shape the way the game feels. Their efforts have really been paying off and the latest balance and content patches have been excellent. Aside from the Tesla Shop and more custom game options (which was just released so I'm sure it'll come), my only complaint is that there needs to be more clothing and weapons purchasable for gold as well as cosmetic gear that people can buy to distinguish and customize their character. You can mix and match clothing pieces to suit your tastes.\n\nIf you're a GunZ 1 player who's looking for a carbon-copy clone, GunZ 2 is not it and that's for the better. You no longer have to be able to press 6 keys per second to effectively evade bullets, ect. While the game might feel slower-paced to people that were used to GunZ 1, it's actually just as fast or even more-so once you learn to utilize wall-running and objects to get around the map instead of dashing on the ground. Wall-running and the like is something EVERY player will have to master if they want to become a great player and it's so much fun once you do.\n\nHope this review was helpful and that some of you who're interested will give this game a shot because it's simply fantastic!","May 1, 2014","true","500.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Wall running. Sick soundtrack.\n\nCons: Rena is OP is all hell, matchmaking is horrendous (lvl 1's being matched with 20's, wtf m80?), and the more you play the more obvious it is that this game is pay to win. Early access and they've gone straight to p2w. You don't stand much of a chance against anyone in a match with more than one level 10+ in a match because all the abilities you don't have yet don't let you. If you decide to download it and play, stay away from Gladiator Mode unless you're willing to put it a decent amount of hours grinding for Refined Ore to get a decent sword, or willing to pay for swords. The community is kinda already headed downhill. Plenty of people complaining about facing noobs, or being matched with higher levels, not the god awful matchmaking system. Frustrations all around.\n\nI hope this game gets better. I loved GunZ 1, I played it for nearly the entirety of my middle school career. I want to love GunZ 2. Until matchmaking is fixes, toons are balanced, and it's playable without having to shell out 30 bucks to get decent gear, don't play this game.\nI'm sticking with it for now, but I shouldn't.\nCome on MAIET, don't mess this up.

As the game chooses a host for the game lobbies, there is very little lag if you are hosting which is good. The amount of customisation is astounding with choices ranging from a curved sword to a straight one. Important notifications are never missed as they scroll across your screen obstructing your view of everything else that is unimportant i.e everything else so you will always know when there is a maintenance which happens very often as MAIET clearly knows how to manage servers and strive to achieve the best game performance they can by constantly taking the servers down to fix the very few issues the game constantly has. The game feels more responsive than a blind, deaf and crippled elderly about to kick the bucket which is really impressive and certainly a next generation improvement. The death animation is amazing as it feels painful to watch, a once lively body suddenly a corpse ragdolling across the map because of a few invisible bullets is incredible. MAIET must have done a really great job as the servers are constantly full which indicates people want to play this game. The only thing that I could possibly criticise is the title of this game, GunZ 2. This implies it is a sequel to another game but I do not believe that this is actually a sequel to anything. If you didn't get the major tone of sarcasm, this game is a complete ♥♥♥♥ing let down and should not carry the name 'GunZ'. You don't have to be good at this game to be good, you just have to be host. The new physics engine so good the game actually breaks and becomes unplayable, wall running is so easy now, you can run through the walls. MAIET, how the ♥♥♥♥ to you down grade like this. Low skill cap as any 'special' moves require ZP and just one press of a button to instantly kill anyone infront of you or escape certain death because you got caught. MAIET takes pride in GunZ 2's biggest strength being freedom of movement, yet this is clearly a very weak point as movement is choppy and too static because they tried too hard in removing animation cancelling. Wisdom comes from age and experience comes from time and work, a few (hundred) years developing this and MAIET managed to become ♥♥♥♥♥ier and the work they have produced is basically just every amateur TPS out there with a few 'perks'. MAIET, did you spend a good year or two perfecting the breast jiggle physics or something? High speed, hard to detect explosions in a small area is a great idea as well as having a stealth skill that takes too long to use on the spot and no where to set up. Also melee in this game is incredibly unbalanced and it is much easier to 'trap' someone now. Any settings higher than low is a party bag full of seizures and frame drops although it does look quite nice, for a bunch of  pictures. Server stability is an issue, the game uses a player hosting system. How the ♥♥♥♥ do you manage to do this? It takes a lot of skill to be this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to make a game this ♥♥♥♥, only skill the game has hey? I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that MAIET's offices are filled with spastics, wouldn't be surprised if I was right. Logic and balance sorely lacking, why are there snipers in maps that are small and crowded and don't get me started on the grenade launchers on the most overpowered class, the ♥♥♥♥♥ wielding, noob tubing, jack-of-all-trades, master of everything, spraying ♥♥♥♥ bag. That is not a character for a game, it's a character for a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ porno. You might argue that it's still early access and beta and all this testing ♥♥♥♥ but this has been in development for 10 years or so and has been out in Korea and Europe for how long? And it's only at this stage. ♥♥♥♥ing amazing work. MAIET is a bunch of cheap porno watching, spastic, call of duty loving, trash of trash ♥♥♥♥ for brains, sub-humanoid idiots that failed their lives. MAIET didn't make GunZ good, the players did and now since they've limited that, they have this, which is less than nothing. " ... excited to release and operate online game service on our own for the first time. " - CEO of MAIET. Mate you guys haven't done ♥♥♥♥ on your own, this ♥♥♥♥ uses a user hosting system and it still lags.

I'm no Master of Epeendom so I died in the tutorial haha\n\nIf you're used to the shift key being for sprint this will be tricky for ya, was for me.  Shift is for guard in this, and then there are these key combos of tap space then tap w twice or press space multiple times to climb a wall, not bad, but takes some getting used to.\n\nThe tutorial isn't enough for slow folks like me to get acclimated to the game environment.  When I died the game said "continue" while counting off from 10 to 0, I pressed enter, left clicked, right clicked, nothing seemed to work to continue, and, since the guys hitting me took 90% of my health in one hit, I realize I'm not out to play a stressy "campaign."\n\nGone it seems are the days of a challenging games, without just making it all about shear force or key combos, games with a decent story, puzzles to complete to gain a permanent bonus or skill on top of what you'd normally have and usually from, or as an incentive for, talomg a different path exploring.  Stress comes from concern of losing your progress if you die from a mob that, if there were more than one of them you wouldn't make it.  No more games with stories that walk you through the gameplay to learn versus just run you through so you can forget more than you remember and let down teammates.  This really could be fun to play, but clearly this game is for a small market, and as a previous reviewer said, "the game is dying," maybe the developers just want it that way.\n\nSure it's a shooter, yet, that doesn't mean it can't have a story or any of that, I figure it's just a Korean game appealing to Korean players in a country where gaming is a significan't national sport, for the most part, thus void of consideration for more casual  players or the full range of possibilities for their game that would bring in a larger range of players as well.","July 21, 2014","true","0.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The game definitely rewards skill and with great precision you can kill even the highest levelled players. The combat can be frustrating when you get completely stunlocked by another player, which is especially frustrating for a new player who does not understand the game yet and is attempting to learn the mechanics. In terms of the gameplay, this game is very good.\n\nThe second thing that I have noticed is that this game is EXTREMELY unbalanced. Although the game claims that it will match you with players of "equal level and skill", it is lying to you. At level 1, you will get matched with level 20 players that have full sets of gear and will tear you apart. This makes learning the basics of the game very difficult. It also makes the game somewhat unfair. They definitely need to fix the matchmaking in this game ASAP. It deters new players (like myself) almost immediately from wanting to play the game any further. The gameplay is great and so is the game itself, but this level of unbalance and the feeling of it being unfair from the very beginning has made me turn my decision and not recommend this game for the moment. The learning curve is too great for you to be thrown into a game full of high level players.\n\nI hope that this gets changed soon, I see real potential in this game.","March 16, 2014","false","2.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

Melee is seriously downgraded especially with the variety of characters' special skills.  Most of the time, their special skill with a full meter will OHK you which is seriously annoying and absolutely does not require much to do.  People spamming their guns at you and waiting for that meter fill up just to do that OHK is what I'm talking about.  Gun play is boring and can't be experimented at the fast rate as it was in the first GunZ because certain guns belong to their respective classes, which I think is massive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  This is also definitely pay-to-win because of that well-known cash shop that every F2P game seems to have.  I'd very much rather pay $20~ to play this game rather than having it F2P and dealing with people who can't afford to be OP and with people who can apparently afford to be OP.\n\nIn all honesty, they should have kept it like the first GunZ, or at least keep it running because this is just a boring mess.  This game is just good as a time-waster now, nothing more.

I personally didnt care either way but k-style or not the game itself is just lacking in so many areas and the prices of the cash shop is so expensive that i just can not recommend this game.","April 19, 2014","false","92.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","3"

What's the problem with it and what are the alternatives? As most GunZ 1 players know, GunZ was a P2P method of gameplay but it didn't for a long time get anti-lead measures.\n\nAs of now, whoever the host is gets extreme priority on hits, and whoever lives closer to the host is the runner up. Meaning that competition will always be tilted in the favor of the host & closer players, aka coast to coast competitions will always be unbalanced.\n\nFuthermore, rather than just having every player connect to one another P2P (not quite sure why not opt for this if you're just going to use a worse and more biased form of this), which would result in equal gameplay between all players, i.e., everyone gets equal priority in games.\n\nOr simply consider measures for setting up dedicated servers & the ability for players to purchase dedicated servers of their own if MAIET doesn't have the money to fund such an endeavor.\n\nWhile there are some other glaring issues, I believe that the current method of networking will inevitably turn players off from the game, even if its other issues are fixed.\n\nP.S. Have been through T Gunz 2, Eu Gunz 2 and some private servers in between. MAIET has been aware for a while about the inefficiency of the system but has not yet decided to re-work the networking.

In fact, it's so dumb and useless, the developers had to create a special area in the campaign missions just so you have a reason to use it. Double jump would have been better. Every time I attacked a group of enemies, my character would finish her combo, and then be counter attacked and die because she feels the need to spend 10 seconds trying to look cool with an animation.\n\nAfter creating my character and playing a few missions and death matches, I realized I had spelled my screen name wrong, and found that there was no real way to go back to the character screen.  So I had to exit the the entire game, and after restarting, I found that you only get the choice of one character, which you can't delete. This game just has a bad format for trying to make it easy for the player. I immediately exited the game, and uninstalled. I don't even wanna try. Even the tutorial was dumb and useless, take a lesson from TitanFall's tutorial, which was both intuitive and interesting.\n\nI did not really have fun playing this, and I loved the first Gunz.","February 20, 2014","false","0.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","11","20","0","0"

The game offers several different characters which each represent a different class. The gameplay itself centers around two main modes, a competitive team deatchmatch style mode, and a cooperative vs ai mode. The gameplay itself is easy to learn but hard to master and just when you think you've figured it out, someone comes along to school you (like me :P) The game offers an old-school shooter feel with powerups and health pickups scattered around the maps. The game features a different mix of gunplay and swordplay for each character.  You can purchase much of the costumes and weapons with in-game currency and if you're a very skilled player, wont need to upgrade very much at all. It offers a challenging third person shooter experience thats free, so its worth a shot. But if you arent very good at shooters to begin with, you might have a hard time getting any fun out of it. (Since you'll be dead)\n\nTHE GOOD\n+ Good graphics for an F2P\n+ Fast Paced Third Person Action\n+ Melee is a blast when you master it\n+ Oldschool shooter feel (not another COD)\n\nTHE BAD\n- Not recommended for beginners\n- Community leaves much to be desired\n- High Learning Curve\n- Matchmaking sometimes screws up pretty bad\n\nTHE UGLY\n"Diehard" fans of the original complaining about everything\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIf you like fast paced shooters or games like devil may cry, this is a fantastic game. Plus its free, so give it a shot! It cant hurt too much.

They also have a ranked mode, featuring the same modes as normal, just with a ranking system (duh :P) and you can only play with 3 other people, while in normal you play with 7 others. Campaign is the same, but you play with 3 others cooperatively against NPCs through a story-driven adventure.\n\n\nMy personal experience from playing this game has been phenomenal. It's really fun and gives me a chance to really break physics :D The people in the community are active and fun to play with (some are just grumpy :P) Either way, I'm sure you'll love the game as much as I do. Also, yes, Maiet's match-making system is pretty bad atm, but I'm sure later on, they'll put in their own servers.\n\n\nI also love the soundtrack in this game. Love it <3\nNow what are you still doing here? Get going and fight it out!","July 12, 2014","true","255.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Because reality is boring.\n\nThough having played the old Gunz and now GUNZ 2, what I felt was a been there done that scenario. I won't whine about the lack of K-Style, the game is excellent in its own way, but it gets stale surprisingly quick, the difficulty of jumping to another lobby after you have finished one has produced some "idle moments", it simply can't keep me hooked on the game.\n\nIdle moments finding a lobby = more procrastination and would lead me to do something else, something more productive rather than spending time playing this game.","July 11, 2014","true","39.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although I do dislike how some of it is pay to win and the items you buy expire, most people you find never use bought items. Also, the matchmaking system can ♥♥♥♥ someone off as you sometimes fight people with much more higher skill than you.\n\nThe campaign is extremely difficult, and you have to always be alert of any enemies spawning behind you, and use your ammo carefully, as the minibosses are full on tanks.\n\nMost of the fighting is usually with guns, but the swords are extremely efficient, as you can just launch enemies up into the air and rekt them. Whether a newcomer or a pro, you will always enjoy this game.\n\nIf you're looking for a game that has fast paced action and a variety of playstyles, pick this up, it's free.\n\nthe costumes are pretty hot too","July 3, 2014","true","7.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Early access is what it is.\n\nI've only played this a handful of times and can say with certainty that it is a decently fun game and somewhat enjoyable to an extent. The maps are diverse and the character abilities are so different between each character that it can help you try to bring a team together with those abilities in mind.\n\nHowever, the amount of lag experienced in the game and the constant rubber banding of players is a hassle to deal with and the weird frame skips at parts. Even some people of the community take advantage of this and make it less enjoyable for players on both sides. Now on to the report function, from my experience if someone dislikes someone, as an example, carrying the team, they can report them for harassment/hacking/etc.\n\nI don't know if there will be anyone looking at the in game logs, but excuses like that happen every so often it's getting really tiring. There's also the fact that the game is in early access and has its own set of bugs that need ironing. That won't stop the bickering however as some are hell bent on being the most 'opinionated' individul in the session.\n\nIt's not a bad game otherwise, just be mindful of the idiots that play.","February 21, 2014","true","4.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikedot/recommended/242720/","mikedot","Mikedot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mikedot/","104 products in account","(PLEASE NOTE: This is technically not a "review" of GunZ 2, but more of an early impressions piece since the game is still in beta form. A follow up review will be made once the game is declared "finished" by MAIET.)\n\nFull impressions: http://www.onrpg.com/articles/editorial/gunz2-steam-early-access-impressions/\n\nAfter several years of waiting, MAIET Entertainment has finally released their high-action multiplayer shooter for (most of) the world to enjoy on Steam’s Early Access program. GunZ 2: The Second Duel is an online third person shooter about killing stuff with style. Players can run up walls, pull off acrobatic movements and switch between gunplay and melee combat on the fly. It's a sequel to the original GunZ: The Duel which came out back in 2003-2005.\n\nor those that do not know: One of the biggest changes in GunZ 2 compared to its predecessor is the removal of K-Style and D-style: Two popular play-styles that significantly changed the overall flow of gameplay by allowing players to jump, dash, block, slash and shoot all at the same time. While this made the gameplay a lot more intense and exciting, it also brought weapon imbalance, made latency issues more apparent and even brought about health concerns from prolonged performance of these techniques, such as Carpal Tunnel.\n\nMAIET thought long and hard about wanting to bring "style play" back for the release of GunZ 2, but came to the conclusion that it was too much of a hassle to bring it all back if they were going to achieve a more balanced shooting game.\n\nWith my extensive time spent playing the South Korean, Europe and Taiwan versions of the game (as if I couldn’t get enough of this game in my life…), it was now time for me to jump head first into the Steam Early Access for North America, just to see if there has been any significant changes made, as well as being able to play against others in my region of world.\n\n---\n\nFirst bit of disappointment that I had with the Steam version was that MAIET still has not included any initial character customization when selecting between the four available classes, which for some reason all have names attached to them unlike before. The Silent Avenger is now called Ivan, the Gunslinger is called Elena, the Shield Trooper’s name is Max and the newest class, the Shadow Dancer, is named Rena. Between these four classes, they each have many different strengths and weaknesses, but you still cannot select different hair styles or faces for them, unlike the original GunZ.\n\nIn the original GunZ: The Duel: Instead of different classes, players had access to a weight system, where they could select any weapon they wanted just as long as the player had enough weight space available to hold them all, and this was all dictated by the armor each character wore, so if a player had good armor, they could carry multiple weapons or heavier weapons. However, this proved to give a false sense of customization in the later levels due to the use of K/D-style limiting most loadout options.\n\nOnce I selected my character, I went through the tutorial which hasn’t changed very much since the EU and TW versions. After completion, one noticeable change was the inclusion of crystals and ores which can be earned from unlocking achievements, opening supply crates every hour and from dismantling equipment. These ores and crystals can be used to earn weapons and equipment from the tesla machine, which is basically a fancy gachapon system. And as much as I dislike gambling systems, the tesla machine is actually very fair in comparison to other gachapon systems, mainly because it actually shows a global number of chances to win each available prize. Once you understand how the tesla machine works, it’s quite possible to wait patiently for the prize list to drop as low as possible to increase your chances of getting the main prizes, which are usually permanent weapons or special costumes.\n\nThe three modes that are currently available in GunZ 2 include Team Deathmatch, Team Elimination and Time Assault:  While Team Deathmatch is fairly self-explanatory; Team Elimination is similar to Team Deathmatch except that players have one life per round. If you die during a match, you cannot respawn. Think of it like a typical round of Counter-Strike with bombing run or hostage capture mode, except that there’s no main objective other than defeating the enemy team… and that people can jump around the environment like something out of a Cirque du Soleil show.\n\nThe other available game mode is Time Assault, which is very much a straight forward Attack & Defend game mode where one team defends one of three target points on the map while the other team tries to destroy those targets. This mode and Team Elimination mode is where the gameplay truly starts to shine, as teamwork plays a big role here. Of course, it’s hard to engage in teamwork when the thought of trying to be a nonstop, badass, one-man army kind of action hero is so tempting, but it usually pays off.\n\nAs to whether or not GunZ 2 takes skill to play compared to its predecessor, I would answer that by saying: It’s debatable. Gameplay is now more focused on team play rather than solo performance, although it is still very possible to hold your own in solo situations, no matter which class you choose. As I’ve seen time and time again where players have been able to carry entire teams on their backs or have been able to clutch it out during a 1-on-4 situation during a team elimination match. These intense moments really show that quick wits are now what GunZ 2 is all about, rather than repetitious muscle memory and a shallow overarching strategy of “spot an enemy and K/D-style them as hard as you can.”\n\nPersonally speaking: After a few matches in normal mode, and having the opportunity of playing with people in my region, I would have to say that Gunz 2 is actually more difficult to play than Gunz 1. Without the crutch of insanely high mobility, I was forced to make decisions more quickly. I found myself dying a lot in Gunz 2 because of the difficulty of adjusting to the more team-based and snap decision making nature of gameplay. Some battles do get pretty mindless (especially up against grenade spamming Elena players and YOLO flamethrowin' Max players), but usually when you’re up against a full premade group, you really need to focus.\n\nThe biggest issue with the Steam version of GunZ 2 is most definitely the lag issues. It seems like MAIET didn’t get the memo that peer-to-peer connections do not work well in online video games outside of South Korea, since not every country out there is the size of a small state, and not everyone has access to T1+ internet connection speeds. Unlike most modern shooting games that use dedicated servers, GunZ 2 randomly assigns one player as the “host” before a match begins, which means that if the host lags, everyone lags. And even if the host has a decent connection, they will still have a major advantage over enemy players due to hitscan detection and registration time. If a player is not selected as the host, they will need to lead their shots constantly; otherwise they’ll be missing a lot of hits. This is especially noticeable when using Ivan’s sniper rifle, where it can take up to half a second or more for a shot to travel from point A to point B, and by the time the shot travels across the map, a target would have already moved from their position.\n\nOverall, in its current state, it shows a lot of promise. Even with the direct removal of K/D-style, it still managed to give me the same thrill and excitement that the original GunZ gave me. If they can manage to develop some kind of netcode that can compensate for the latency issues before adding new content, then I could see GunZ 2 having quite a long life span.","March 3, 2014","true","157.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The peer host system is out of date for today's standards, it's hard to adjust from 100+ ping to 50 ping games when they keep fluctuating one after another (and you also get them people who download 500 million torrents while they're the host). The classes are NOT balanced. For instance, the stealth class's melee attacks are nearly as slow as the heavy class's but weaker, so you get stuck doing swing aniamtions that are not as powerful and make you a "not so stealthy stealth person". The heavy class gets a flame thrower, minigun, AND a riot shield... so the only efficient way to kill him is from afar with grenades or a rifle. If they made the stealth class faster (in animation and cancles), and the heavy class nerfed (just ever so slightly), this game would be much nicer. Also people use tons of macros in this game, so if you don't have a gaming keyboard and/or you don't have macro software for it, then you will likely not enjoy this game as much.\n\nBut hey, it's only in beta right? what could go wrong?","March 14, 2014","false","38.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Seeing as it is my only point of reference to any game that comes even remotly close to this game for Action based Shooting goes. One thing from the original that is not present here is the K-Style which was just an interesting combination of exploits animation cancel bugs and glitches. It will take those who are used to that some time to adapt to the new style of play but it is worth your time to do so.\n\nI have logged 15.8 hours on this game while working each day and i am loving every moment i spend on it.\nA worthwhile grab for any old GunZ Vet looking to make some heads roll and for te person who maybe never touched the Original title.  Once you get pasted the learning curve you will find hours of fun in TDM Team Elimination and A&D Maps with more modes to come!\n\nI CANNOT wait to see what the future has in store for GunZ 2 bu you can expect me to be there waiting Katana in hand awaiting my next Trial by fire.\n\n-Blyte","February 21, 2014","true","40.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was expecting some rather fast paced combat, with all the quick sword dashing, of the original but it was not to be found. Instead this version seems to focus much more heavily on the guns while making the melee weapons significantly less better this time around. Everything about this version of GunZ is essentially prettier but much more watered down. I wouldn't recommend it.","March 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Everything is much more "restricted" in this game.  Your choice of character design for the most part doesn't exsist.  Skills like aerial recovery(which at the time of writing doiesn't work btw) or wake-up attacks are now tied to a meter.  Instead of "styles" you're given a skill tree which you have to unlock by levels to even get were once basic skills such as aerial recovery.  Every class has a skill from the get go that is basicly an instant kill.  Lag is rampent due to the p2p structure and net code they use.  Oh and instead of their being a lobby with a selection of games you're auto matched into a game LoL style.\n\nOn the plus side the game looks nice.  Wall running is slightly more flexible than in Gunz1.  Did I mention it's prettier than the original?  Not to say that the game doesn't have any other good points, something about it is enough to give me a small hope for the future.\n\nI've tried repeatedly to like this game as a GunZ successor since I was a fan since Ijji days but honestly I can only enjoy it knowing thinking its not a true successor.  Hopefully MAIET pulls a FF14 and polishes this game into something more rather than pull a FF13.\n\nEdit\n\nWith the last patch update the netcode has gotten even worse increasing lag to horrid levels.  Match making is pretty unbalanced placing unranked players of low level against ranked players of max level.  And its come to my attention that gear heavily influences the flow of the game.  If you have no premium tesla gear and go up against someone who does, chances are you're gonna lose severely especially if the level difference is not in your favor.","March 16, 2014","false","110.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game should really just have a standard male/female character with more customization.\nTHE BIGGEST ISSUE is that this game is no longer skill based.

Everything is much more "restricted" in this game.  Your choice of character design for the most part doesn't exsist.  Skills like aerial recovery(which at the time of writing doiesn't work btw) or wake-up attacks are now tied to a meter.  Instead of "styles" you're given a skill tree which you have to unlock by levels to even get were once basic skills such as aerial recovery.  Every class has a skill from the get go that is basicly an instant kill.  Lag is rampent due to the p2p structure and net code they use.  Oh and instead of their being a lobby with a selection of games you're auto matched into a game LoL style.\n\nOn the plus side the game looks nice.  Wall running is slightly more flexible than in Gunz1.  Did I mention it's prettier than the original?  Not to say that the game doesn't have any other good points, something about it is enough to give me a small hope for the future.\n\nI've tried repeatedly to like this game as a GunZ successor since I was a fan since Ijji days but honestly I can only enjoy it knowing thinking its not a true successor.  Hopefully MAIET pulls a FF14 and polishes this game into something more rather than pull a FF13.\n\nEdit\n\nWith the last patch update the netcode has gotten even worse increasing lag to horrid levels.  Match making is pretty unbalanced placing unranked players of low level against ranked players of max level.  And its come to my attention that gear heavily influences the flow of the game.  If you have no premium tesla gear and go up against someone who does, chances are you're gonna lose severely especially if the level difference is not in your favor.","March 16, 2014","false","110.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game should really just have a standard male/female character with more customization.\nTHE BIGGEST ISSUE is that this game is no longer skill based. The game has turned into a contest of who can melee the other one down the ground and finish them with an SMG first.\nTHE SECOND BIGGEST ISSUE is that once you've been struck by a melee attack, you're stuck in the combo until you get knocked down and shot with an SMG.\n\nIt's really quite displeasing that there's no real way to block once you've been hit.\n\nWhile although this game is a slight letdown to anyone who has played the first GunZ game, it's still relatively fun. Since it's not a complete game I can only hope that the Devs listen to the community and bring back a playstyle that is based on skill and reactions.\n","March 10, 2014","true","3.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/magikavin/recommended/242720/","magikavin","Magi Kavin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/magikavin/","445 products in account","One of those stereotypical Korean games, it's a sequel to the old carpal-tunnel-inducing game GunZ: The Duel. Whereas GunZ: The Duel was fast-paced gunkata action that would wreck your wrists and fingers permanently, GunZ 2: The Second Duel is a slower game that focuses on player classes instead of allowing everyone to customize their characters and kit them out with whatever weapon they liked the most. This is both good AND bad.\n\nThe Good: Every character has their particular quirks that makes them great against some and weaker against everyone else. Each character comes with a particular set of skills; passives and extra movement options are unlocked as levels are earned. You can feasibly unlock every character and level them up individually, but that's tedious and boring. You're better off finding the one character you click with and sticking with them through your journey into the disappointment that is GunZ 2: The Second Duel.\n\nThe Bad: Everything else. The game has HORRIFIC netcode. I mean, I had not thought it was possible to beat old early 90's FPS netcode meant for 56K modems, but GunZ 2: The Second Duel proves that they achieved what they'd set out to do. Expect to see enemies warping around the map, and dying to enemies you can't even see on a regular basis. The only time these problems are alleviated are if you are the game's host; then, your ping is non-existent and you pretty much win the game if you're even slightly competent.\n\nThe Ugly: It's a free-to-play game, so it attracts the worst kinds of people the internet has to offer. The game insists on upgrading your weapons, but there's ALMOST NO DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE between the weapons statistically, and some of the weapons you can upgrade to EVEN WITH USING REAL MONEY have LITTLE TO NO IMPACT on the game whatsoever, and some are even WORSE THAN YOUR BASE WEAPONRY. Admirable, but no-one cares what kind of flashy weapon or skin you're using, 'cause 90% of the time people aren't even looking at you. Similarly hilarious, some of the miscellaneous items for sale - such as a hat that looks like a cat cutely perching on your head, ready to pounce - are EXORBITANTLY expensive for a F2P game.\n\nHonestly, steer well clear of this game. If you're even slightly interested in the game, at least wait for them to fix the netcode before playing, else you'll walk out of the game wishing you'd listened to me.","March 12, 2014","false","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

So, when the Beta finally opened for NA... well... I had to wait a few more days.\nAfter the standard launch issues cleared up, I jumped in to see if it would live up to the hype.\n\nFirst off I was disappointed to see that they had removed customization in favor of four preset classes.\n\n\n\nIvan wields a sniper rifle, katana, and SMG.\nRena duel swords, duel pistols, and SMG.\nElena a baseball bat, assault rifle, and nade launcher.\nMax is equipped with a riot shield, mini gun, and flame thrower.\n\nEach character does have a few sets of clothing and weapons to purchase, but it's cosmetic and slight stat variations. At least it means nothing is pay to win at the moment.\nThe shop does sell a few cosmetic items for real money at the moment.($15 for a hat!)\n\nI picked Ivan and moved on to the lobby, which is your standard shooter lobby other than that(for the moment) there doesn't seem to be a way to select the room you join. You can queue up for 1-3 types of PvP.\n\n-Team Death Match\n-Team Elimination- Kill the entire enemy team. First to 5 wins.\n-Time Assault- Destroy the enemy teams object within a set time.\n\nor you can do the Co-op campaign.\nI picked PvP.\n\nSo, now we can talk about combat.\nIn GunZ 1 I despised K-Style because of how it was implemented. It was basically a glitch that the developers didn't bother to fix. For GunZ 2 I was hoping for a more refined combat system. Something fast and elegant. Something that could match the good parts of K-style and remove the bad.\nSo did GunZ 2 deliver?\n\nWell, it can be fast. Really fast. Not just movement but TTK is really low. If you get caught in a combo, you're stun-locked and dead.\n\nI personally miss the epic battles from GunZ 1. Two equally skilled players could fight back and forth for minutes.\n\nIn GunZ 2 that's replaced by a lot mindless spamming. Blocking is made almost useless by special abilities that characters gain as the level up, meaning that combat in GunZ 2 is roughly the equivalent of Call of Duty with swords.\n\nDespite the disappointment from the combat system, I decided to give the campaign a try. Surprisingly where the games shines. They're actually MMO instance quality missions. There are lots of waves but the require awareness, positioning, weapon and ability management to clear.\nBosses can feature multiple stages and well scripted abilities that require a bit of thought to counter.\n\nI haven't finished the campaign yet but so far it's fun. The downside is there doesn't seem to be any form of reward. I have yet to get a shinny new gun or even a dirty sock. Cash gains from it are also slow in comparison to the PvP modes.\n\nOverall, it's a fun game despite the fact the combat is frustratingly lacking of depth. I really hope they refine it a bit more and try to get a little closer to what I liked about GunZ 1 rather than a third person version of Team Fortress 2. Still, It's free the campaign is pretty cool. Give it a try.","February 25, 2014","false","59.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solification/recommended/242720/","Solification","Sol","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solification/","36 products in account","For me this game has its ups and downs. I don't know where to bomb this game or to just keep playing to the point where i WANT to like it. it's very unfortunate to say that "The Wait was worth it" because overall it's not.\n\nOld GunZ players, you guys know what i'm talking about when i say this.\n\nThe bad in my eyes in this game are:\n\n- The Classes. Why? why make classes? before, you either made a male, or a female, then choose from a WIDE Variety of "GunZ" (Lolol) And own people to your pleasing. Now, you either choose from a\n\n1) Assassain (Sword , Sniper, Smg)\n\n2) Gunslinger (Rifle, Shotgun/Genedier?, And a bat)\n\n3) Tropper (Heavy Gatling Gun, Flamethrower and Sheild)\n\nI mean, why break what isn't broken?\n\n- The Matchmaking. there is no Lobbies per say. its something my Friend calls a "Queue Lobby". It's where you can invite friends and Such for 5v5 4v4v 3v3 2v2's against others. It's pretty sick, thats actually a good side , but what bugs me is that you can't make a private room for you and your friends. What if we wanted to get some practice in? it sucks that the game didn't implement that in the beginning.\n\n- The USD Prices. Wtf? i saw a beginner's box set for $34 bucks. What? Bro, thats like me spending $34 on candy thats expired. Why are the prices so high in this game? a damn horse head was $15. i LITERALLY got a unicorn head in real life for less!\n\n- R.I.P K style. The "Styles" in GunZ went into a era that GunZ ever experienced. The "styles" were made by the users, its a way of life when it came to GunZ. i was a D Styler, Dagger user. and it was Pretty dandy. but in GunZ 2, that Era Ceased to exist (For now hopefully). So for now, R.I.P K style.\n\n\n__________________________________________________________________\n\nNow the good stuff that i actually liked\n\n- The movement. That's some great movement speed i was going with the tropper, i'm maining him, so i was thinking that he'd be REALLY slow. But thats not the case at all. its quite the opposite. He's Fast, He climbs (Literally) up the walls, and he can keep up with the team.\n\n- Dat Shield tho. the shield literally makes me happy . The fact that you can run WHILE blocking is Phenomenal. it literally makes me go "CHARGING STAR" and all that. i love that damn shield like it was my mom.\n\n- The fact that the whole game is a "Early Access Game". MANNNNNNYYYYY of us, including myself, forget that this game is basically a beta, a Open beta to be exact. This game is basically not finished yet. this is actually my first time palying a beta. and i see why i don't like it so much AT THE MOMENT. probably in a few days, they'll add all the good things we Gamers want into this game.\n\nOverall? i LIKE it. like, if GunZ 2 added me on Facebook, he'd be understand "Acquaintance". Thats exactly how i feel about this game. it has it's ups and it's downs. He may be someone i just met and added, but he has the potential of being a friend, or being deleted.\n\nAnd yes, i recommend this game to ANYONE, New or old.\n\nThat's all folks, if you want, see me in-game (IGN: Frisbee) . i'll be honing my skills till the game comes out.","February 18, 2014","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

And when I downloaded and played it, that is exactly what I received.\nI was also pleasantly surprised by the 4player Co-op option and the the campaign doesn't start off fantastic I hear it gets fairly good, and playing with three friends always makes things more fun.\nThe game also has pay to win and MMO elements;\nMMO elements like friends lists, PMs, and the option to make a clan, add something nice to the game.\nI found the "pay to win"esque nature of the game wasn't a deal breaker for me, because it's more like "pay to advance faster". Without paying a single cent you can exceed at the game by skill alone easily.\n\nThe other thing is game progression, meaning players who have spent longer on the game will have better gear than you, and a few extra abilities.\nHowever, this does not put them at an extreme advantage, and is balanced nicely.\nOn my first game I was able to get a nice amount of frags even though I was a beginner.\nIn terms of gear, the best gear is only slightly better than the defalut stuff, with upgrades being slight. This means that no matter what, you still need skill to win, not money. A player with the best gear will still easily be poned by a more skilled player.\n\nI think this game s a lot of fun because of the ninja like elements to it with the wall running, the variance in the classes, and because of a lot of the unique gameplay aspects in it. Being able to switch weapons quickly means that a lot of the time you will be most efficient in using your entire aresenal agains an opponent, like switching from close range to mid range quickly to retreat from a flamethrower, or as a sniper dashing back quickly from an approaching assailant with a sword, to then quickly pull out your own sword and dash forward to catch them off guard. I like that you can use weapons while dashing and wallrunning, meaning I can dash sideways to avoid a sniper, and then quickly run across the wall towards him firing my SMG while jumping from wall to wall to avoid his fire, then dash to the side onto a pillar, then change to my sword while running in a spiral around that pillar so he can't keep track of me, then dash behind him and finish him off with the sword.\n\nThere are breast physics as some have so crudely fixated on, but unless you are swinging around character models in the lobby, they don't distract from gameplay. Also when characters with skirts die sometimes, they ragdoll into some compromising positions, but again, it's easy to either ingore or fixate on, depending on your attittude.\n\nSo in short, I really love the gameplay.\nI love the way it blends long, mid, and closerange.\nI love how fast paced it is.\nI love the ability to form my own clan or get tegether a team line up with my friends and together wreak havoc online.\nI love fealing like a ninja when I drop off a chandelier to take down an unsuspecting enemy.\nI love the split second reactions in just the sword play alone, and I love that there is a whole gamemode dedicated to this.\n\nPersonally, I recomend this game, it's fun and it's free.","May 12, 2014","true","208.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

All the other classes seem pretty balanced... like Max is very good close range , Ivan long range and Elena mid range.... but Rena just seems to be like a cross between them all and is not really great at anything... i had hard time earning exp on Rena really.... on Invan i'd go like 12:6:X 20:X:X and just level up early on from 1 game you know why ? cuz of his long range pewpew... And no im not talking right now about skill... im talking about the Mechanics of guns ofc( just my opinion ) anyway to shorten this - all classes seem well rounded except Rena.\n\n(EDIT): maybe  make her pistols more precise  or instead of this pretty useless burst fire mode on pistols give her kinda like a "sniping" mode to increase accuracy on her shots well.. okay maybe leave the burst fire mode for high mag pistols but like i bought the pistols that do more dmg has smaller fire rate and less ammo in a mag so burst fire is pretty useless cuz i lose all my ammo in an instant and dont really do much... so maybe make some sorts of other pistols that are for sniping at mid/high range ? that'd make people have a choice between fast fire rate or high dmg output. make her a mid-range sniper of sorts... just something so she doesn't feel as "allover the place" when it comes to a role\n\ncuz let's be honest - Ivan has a zoom that helps him ( doesn't increase recoil or decrease accuracy... why give Rena a burst fire mode that decreases her movement speed ? like really ? doesn't it seem weird to you ? yeah it seems to give you a little less recoil but not really that much to make it reliable... i personally haen't found it useful in fights at all... unless you get to somehow stand still somewhere people can't see you in mid/low range to use it... which usually doesn't happen.\n\n-Not enough video option control - when i enable a single option in Advanced options tab it DRASTICALLY reduces the fps... how about giving some more options if that's possible ? also some brightness slider would be nice\n\n-Restrictions on Swords... why does Rena Strictly have to have 2 swords and Ivan 1 Sword... i get the thought process behind making guns class specific but why melee weapons ?  it's nice to make some restrictions but imo too much is not good either.\n\n-No advanced Movement mechanics... yes yes i know blaa blaa Gunz 1 broken.. stuff.. stuff noobs are noobs , pros are pros, stuff stuff.... but really... im not talking here about the HUGE bugs like Reload shot or dagger lunge bug thing ( forgot how its called ) but simples ones really that made it more fun and the movements more varied to trick your enemy etc.\n\nwall slash-climbing - when you hit the wall to jump again and go up the wall.\n\nMaybe some kind of a dash cancel maybe not quiet butterfly step-ish but something that would let you to cancel your dash in mid air or maybe just make the gap between dashes shorter.. you know what i mean,... like something not as straight forward... the dashing is really now just 4 direction 1 dash a seconds or smthn...\n\n-no replay function... one thing that should be there. Gunz 1 had it why not implement it in Gunz 2 ? it's not like it was a bug or anything.. just a convenient tool.\n\n\n- no changeable crosshair ( size , shape etc )\n\nanyway i hope that made sense , sorry for my awful english and ty for reading i suppose.\n\nStill love the game and will Continue playing it and following the news and such,\ncya ingame buddies ^^_\n\nP.S ofc i left out the "need more maps", "need more items" garbage... since that will come probably soon.","February 24, 2014","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If you like old message boxes of GunZ past,  you'll be sure to enjoy the new "yellow" message boxes.

Fight and learn to outsmart your targets. This game is a great example of what a action game should be.

It was one of the best experiences of my gaming life. Met people, joined a clan, reeeeally got into mid-pvping (thou never was good enough to get even near the top 500 xD) and had a good time just being part of a game that was actually not too bad, for what it was.\n\nNow after saying that, Gunz 2... is nothing like the original, besides the name. Yes the combats similiar, but the limited choice of equipment without buying extra characters can be annoying. Pvp is full of the predictable hackers (F2P, watcha expect right) that just never seem to get taken care of after numious reports, and Co-op is just.. generally bad for new and casual gamers. Seriously, the price tag for the coins you need to revive in that mode is $2.50 American Dollars.. that is actual money you got to put into this game just to revive one time. One. Time. Can anyone else say giant rip-off?\n\nDo I recommand this game? Only if you go in, not expecting more than you normally should in a F2P. It has its perks, and if you get heavily enough into it, ya, I can see why theres a community at least attempting to go around the company trying to make it pay to win.\n\nJust.. don't try to make water into beer here. At least you don't got to pay a dime into it to enjoy casual games with a select group of friends, and having a good time dueling :)","May 13, 2014","true","24.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Gunz the Second duel is a huge dissapointment. I came willingly with my money ready and my memories of the hack and slash fun times i use to have (when there weren't hackers all over it) i was brimming with excitement when i saw this hit the steam store and was playing it immediatley, but what i thought would have been a smoother re-vamped super shiny new content filled game... turned out to be one of the worst experiences i have ever had with an online game. Sure while i write this review the game is in open beta but it doesn't even feel ready for that it is clunky, laggy, choppy, buggy, the game feels like it is still in pre alpha and should not be played yet. My first experience with this game was myself and my brother jumping into the single player campaign  thinking oh sweet some fun co-op to play beside the main multiplayer side of it, but what we got was a bunch of hallways and corridors filled with enemies that could so easily destroy you the second you take a wrong step careful not to get hit once or the enemies stun lock you and kill you almost imediatley. They also have the nerver to add  in a life system with COINS as your life you start the day with 3 coins you can use to revive yourself and fallen allies if you lose all 3 of them back to the start you go with nothing gained, making it super hard to enjoy it with just a friend. they then basically force you to buy revival coins to continue playing the single player side of the story when it's not lagging that is, and don't even think of playing it alone there isn't a hope in hell of playing through it unless your willing to pour money into the game. Now the multiplayer... OH BOY.. THE MULTIPLAYER... there is nothing good to be said about it it's CLUNKY, IT'S GLITCHY, and from my experience so far so laggy that your enemy if they are the host will have killed you before you have even seen them appear, you simply die while seeing these bodies of the other players jumping around the room at 1 frame a second. And the classes are NOT BALANCED AT ALL. Swordplay is almost useless in this game the only thing it's good for is it's knock up ability and even then once they are knocked up they can't be hit again unless you switch over to your gun and shoot at there stunned body on the floor. and the servers are terrible. This is not gunz this is not fun if your thinking this will be just like the first game don't even bother this is not worth your time give it a year or two then look back into it maybe they might have a working game, and a non-linear unbalanced story, MAYBE!!! they might not use every asset they have to extort the player base into spending money to play the damn game... i give GUNZ THE SECOND DUEL a 3/10 for at least giving me a look at what could have been a sequel.","February 24, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can still turn back on a few bits of old skills once you get the hang of it but wall climbing is NOT the same. You simlply run up the wall until you run out of momentum and re-apply the wall-run to climp up.\n\nI'd say the only downside is you can't used the weapons you want to use like the first one.

Now they have this lame certain gender only character class system that lets you only use certain weapons. BIG DISSAPOINTMENT. Instead of locking the weapons to specific characters they should have just made each character have different stats and maybe some different abilities with Pros and Cons to each character (i.e. The big tank dude would have more health than other characters but be alot slower in the movement area.) another feature to help balance it out would be that some weapons will have different affects on some characters (i.e. If a smaller character used the gatling gun it would slow down her movement speed a little, big guy used lighter weapons it would not be able to aim as well cause of his big muscles( I cant really think of a downside to this at the moment)). It seems that game developers wasted their time making up these characters when they could have focused more on gamplay and customization.\n\nWith that said the combat system has improved and without that ridiculous butterfly technique in the first game, Gunz 2 is alot more nooby friendly. Adding the special moves and passives help make your character a little more unique. The Story missions is a nice change of pace and gives you something else to do other than pvp.\n\nOverall its about an average game that can be fun for awhile and would have been better if you had the ability to mix and match weapons.","May 10, 2014","true","13.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KneeGrovv/recommended/242720/","KneeGrovv","Knee - Summer tiem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KneeGrovv/","30 products in account","Play this game first. The biggest problem that people have with this game is that they never play it long enough. Until you get at least 100 hours, you don't know what you're talking about.\nThe game is a lot different from when you first play it to when you have learned how to play it.\n\n0/10 no sdk, no anti-lead, barely any customization\n\nSome people like some games, others don't.\nReviews are never solid.\nTry this game for yourself and come up with your own opinion, that is the only way to get an accurate review for yourself.\n\nThis is what I think Maiet should have done:\n• Add weapons, maps, characters\n• Add patches when you add weapons, maps, characters\n***• KEPT IT LIKE THE KOREAN BETA, EVERYTHING LOOKED FINE BACK THEN\neven early access was better than today's GunZ 2\n\nAfter a substantial amount of time with this, I don't like how this game feels.\nLet me give you a few reasons why:\n\nI: The feeling of the game\n\n1) Dashing, as useful as it is, it doesn't flow as well as GunZ 1, though MAIET makes it a point to    make this sequel very different from GunZ 1, the only way to keep your speed is to keep dashing.\nThe only way to make dash work is to make things a bit more complicated, not too much.\nIntegrate it with double dashing, dash jump dash\n\n2) Wall climbing\nIt's inconsistent. I'm not trying to ring in anyone's ear about GunZ 1, but it has the same problem as    dashing does. You can't go up at a constant rate. When you are at the top end of your wallrun    upwards, you completely stop until it finally reads that you've pressed the spacebar again. It takes    too long to get anywhere.\n\n3) Stunlock\nThey should have thrown this out altogether. You can't guard against it and you are at the mercy of    your attacker. It is one of the main reasons why this game feels awkward and why melee is ruined.\n\n4) Melee\nOne of the most broken pieces of the game. Why on earth is every hit a stunlock? Why am I    playing 3D super smash bros? I understand Maiet's part in trying to make this game more    strategic, but he just recreated another way of playing the game "chicken". I would much rather    prefer stunlock until your target finds a way out of it. Max is a fine example of that, a good melee    stunlock until his opponent finally turns around and blocks.\nNo counter attacks besides parry? Really? That's really boring.\n\n****************************************\nAll of the melee weapons do the EXACT SAME THING, they stunlock, then eventually knock you    down, if you got rid of the sounds and models, you couldn't tell who is using what\n\nThe daggers don't have a lunge (Rena's R doesn't count)\nThe sword and blunt weapon and daggers and shield ALL can flip\nEVEN Wayne's whip can flip\n****************************************\nII. Weapons\n\n1) Accuracy\nThe accuracy of automatic weapons (and Wayne's pistol) are just horrible.\nThough thirdperson may distort your depth perception to make everything smaller, it shouldn't make    your gun shoot in the same cone shape a shotgun's spread has.\nIt is far too inconsistent and there really isn't that much to compensate for it, it is a completely    random circle that the bullets decide to go to.\nI understand that they don't want people to die in an instant from any distance but the Coffin and    Striker are just unusable at mid range.\nSure, they are supposed to be close range weapons since they are SMGs but being close range    just makes you vulnerable to melee attacks.\n\n2) Variety\nThere is no variety here, another thing that irritates me. Each class is limited to 2 different    weapons, and you cannot have 2 of the same or one that belongs to a different class (With the    exception for Ivan and Rena's SMGs). No standard revolvers or pistols for anyone to share.\n\n3) Tesla shop\nI don't feel I need to explain this\nTrying to get premium items without money?\nGood luck.\n\nIII. Customizability\n\n1) Characters\nThey come with preset clothes? And they HAVE to buy them with 15000 gold?\nSure gold is easy to come by, but you can't by clothes for every class\nafter already using 15000 for each individual weapon\n\n2) Weapons\nI liked the level weapons from GunZ 1 only because there was a huge array of options\nThough, I appreciate being able to buy anything no matter what level I am, there are very little    options to choose from.\n\n3) Maps\nThe maps are okay, but I wish they'd make a replica of Dungeon from GunZ 1\nThe new maps are not okay, they just rip them from the campaign levels and call it a day (with the    exception of the hunter training course)\n\n\n---------------------------------------------OLD REVIEW--------------------------------------------------------\nJust as its successor was able to make a freedom of movement type of gameplay, this seems a much more balanced game.\nNo more shotgun spamming, no more slash shot spamming or any overpowered moves that eliminates the purpose of all the other weapons.\nThankfully, people's aim will be improved as soon as they stop using those shotguns.","February 17, 2014","false","057.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenHeaven/recommended/242720/","FallenHeaven","FallenHeaven","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FallenHeaven/","117 products in account","Ok so my friend challenges me to a game of gunz and suggests Gunz 2 as an alternative since it came onto steam. First thing we look for is a practice mode and a private match mode. Both of which are missing. This is a troubling begginning since the first gunz was all about skill and what is that without a method of practice? I start looking through the inventory and shop and such to see if there are any minor improvements or otherwise that I could make. Yet again I am sorely dissappointed by the addition of some for of RPG like stats for random crits etc. These are not for a shooter which is what I remember gunz to be. Next we have the clan set up. We started one up before even getting into first match which is good for accessability however inviting people from the clan menu does not work. Invite from friends menu worked. Let's try clicking our game mode. Oh...it kicked my teammate...Oh...now it won't let me reinvite him. Relog. Works again. Try out campaign time because the PvP is looking very far out of the question right now. Get in game> Try dashing.....well....that was uneventful. Try chaining dashes>...Oh...doesn't do anything. Try wall running> Very clunky...kinda slow... Ok so they firmly destroyed the games mobility aspect. Let's try some combat. Slash>Block Nope, animation is too clunky for that. Oh hey right click jumps higher than space bar. Maybe I can use that with dash! Nope disappointed it again. Weapon swap works well!...Oh look at that...There's no way to really defend as a melee specialist. The only thing they had before was mobility and that is very...lax...If you are looking for the original gunz play style you are going to be sorely disappointed. Sorry Maiet...I had major suspicions when "Raiderz" was announced as a trial of the engine before Gunz 2 came out but this surely affirms all the failures I foresaw.\n\nTL;DR: It plays with the mobility of TERA and has the nerve to call the game a sequal to Gunz","February 25, 2014","false","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The combat flows nicely, there is some decent customization, and everything has had a graphical upgrade. There are 4 characters that play drastically different depending on one's play style, all of which are very balanced (despite most people saying they aren't). All of the characters also have there own arsenal of weapons and skills which adds some depth and progression to the game. This game is skill/knowledge based which makes it extremely fun and gives it a reasonable learning curve. The skill is mainly dodging and gunplay while the knowledge is how to counter certain characters/playstyles. The game also has a decent story through The Campaign Mode which is also fun and challenging. They currently only have one campaign but by the looks of it they plan to add more along with some challenge modes (which I am looking forward to).\n\nHowever, there are 3 minor issues that I have had with the game which I pressume are being worked on. The first problem I have is lack of PvP game modes. There are currently 3 (being Team Deathmatch, Team Elimination, and Time Assualt) all of which are very basic (i.e. Kill enemy team). The Second problem I have is lack of map variety. There are currently 7 maps most of which, although funtional and good looking, are very bland in design. Basically all maps have 3 ways to get to the same area which makes maps seem very small (I assume this is to keep up the hectic and fast paced action of the game). My final issue I have with this game are the coins for the Campaign. The coins are extra lives for when you die and you only get 3 a day, which dont get me wrong is more generous than most games, but I think the vast majority of people would have prefered 3 per level or checkpoint revives.\n\nOverall I find this game enjoyable but, slighty lacking in variety. I would reccomend this to any fan of the original Gunz, or someone looking for fast paced enjoyable gun combat.","February 24, 2014","true","16.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

(he can't move much while shooting and is an easy target), it's also frustrating that he gets immunity to knock back from mellee weapons when shooting but I guess it makes him somewhat powerful, though Ivan can easylly HS 1 hit him.\n- Bugs I've encountered so far (often): At the end of 25% of my games, I 've had to close the game by pressing alt+f4 in order to reopen and go back in lobby, losing my crates. If you chat in team chat right before entering a game in the lobby the game closes and you get hell banned for 14 minutes from getting in another pvp game (red card).\n- Options that should be implemeneted to facilitate the UI : A leave group button when in a party.\n- Options that may cater to other players: Practice mode, Custom games, A game lobby (you can still implement the quick start button), Voting to change hosts (some laggy hosts don't know a lick of english for some reason)\n\nAside from whats mentionned above, the game is amazing in it's current state, I do not mind the removal of butterfly, which was, as mentionned in alot of previous statements, a bug. The class system is nice, but alot of old gen players hate it, maybe it would be better to have a character creator where you could make you're own character, chose skills and use any weapons (like in gunz 1, but way more elaborate). The class system in this game has been done before , people look for innovation, not copy paste.\n\nAnyway, I do not mind the class system, I love the fact that it takes no time to get to level 20 as well. The current cash related model is fine and not p2w which is great. It'd be cool if crystals were a bit easyer to get since it' incredibly hard to get anything good from the tesla shop.\n\nAside from all mentionned above, Gunz 2 is a fun fast paced mmofps that I love and hope will grow into something better. If anyone reading this is new, Rena is 50k gold, so start with her to avoid whining about that later on. See you in the mansion (most probable map)","February 24, 2014","true","43.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

So let face it. this is beta! you cant ask for a Full game in beta- Beta means there will be bug's (and heck their not noticeable after the last few update's). So im here to explain the downside's of current beta. the diffreance of Gunz1 & 2 and what old gunz1 viet might be missing and soon love.\n\nThe current major downside is trying to get into the game. you need to restart the game about 4-6 time's to get into the "full server"\n\nun-noticeable learning curve for wall running/ fighting that old K-styler might enjoy. The gun system is little wacky at time's and there definitely some OP combo's at lower tier's (level15 bellow).\n\nif you just started the game. worry about leveling up a char to lv10+. heck lv20. save your money for those nifty screw thing's like +hp, +Def. lv10 you get 1. lv20 you got 5. then take those screw and upgrade em. IT WILL FAIL UPGRADE'S. but you will get end results of ALOT more armor and HP or w/e one you pick and you just end up owning everyone cuz they don't know about the screw upgrading (do it alot ;p )\n\n\nSo whats change from Gunz1 in Gunz2?\n1.No K-style.\n\n2.No over powered items that you need to use real money to buy from Shop/lotto.\n\n3.New leveling system. what can be a big change for some people but it has it's up's and down's.\n\n4.Character system with set 3 weapons.\n\n-Currently 4 character's to pick from- more will come out later\n-This looks to be inplaced into the game so that not everyone useing the "sword+shootgun" only set. and let's face it Gunz1 everyone used a sword+shootgun. From my understanding they will be adding more guns later so there were not all stuck with the same 3 weapon's.\n\n5.Old gunz1 maps are still around in gunz2 (there still being added)\n\n6.Quickly enter game's with the new lobbying system.\n\n7. Freestyle wallrunning (and OMG once you get the hang of it, it's way nicer then then old K-style wall runing(im not one for the glitchy looking wall run sorry))\n\n8.The storymode is semi hard. and bosses are dam fun once you know there trick's. you get 3 respawn coins once a day and they stack up (so now i got 10. respawn for days!)\n\n9. The new lotto. Every hour you can claim a gift (normally ore's) that can be use for the lotto to get gun that last for 1-7 days or can be perma. you can also take appart the tier 1 guns to get the tier2 ore's and get the nice prim item's (so hot) but same thing for em'. last for 1-7 days or they can be perma (again so hot). This rewards the players who play gunz more o/c and the new players have abit more struggle (sorry newbies).\n\nI hope to review more later on about this game later on. if you got any question's feel free to ask!","February 21, 2014","true","151.0"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

On one hand, the PVE mode is pretty bad. It's brutally diffucult. You pretty much die after taking 5 hits, so the learning curve is pretty high to start. But even the most experienced player will find it's impossible to clear the PVE mode because of the shockingly limited ammo supply characters have. With little to no way to restore ammo, you find yourself, one way or another, out of ammo, and forced to use your melee weapon...in a gunfight. Death usually follows shortly after that...and then the game will try to pressure you into buying revival tokens. Clearly, the PVE mode was crassly put together to force players to buy revival tokens. It will take close to 30 tokens to clear your average level, so unless you enjoy paying close to 60 dollars just to clear a level, I suggest you steer clear...\n\nDespite how awful the PVE mode is, the PVP mode is worse. Basically, it's entirely pay to win.\nOnce you're dropped into a PVP round, which will most likely lag and stutter to a strong degree, you'll notice the only way to really get kills is to use a melee class, or a sniper rifle.\nBut not just any melee or sniper rifle, oh no! You need the special premium gear, which can only be obtained by using this game's abomination of a cash shop, the "telsa shop." Basically, while other games charge you big bucks for game winning items, THIS game charges you big bucks for a CHANCE at game winning items.\nThe kicker? Even if you spend hundreds of dollars (which is, by the way, a low estimate of how much it will cost)\nand get lucky, there's no guaruntee that your class will even be able to use the item you get.\n\nBasically, this game is a very expensive coin op. Pay for extra lives, or you can't have fun in PVE.\nPay for the best gear in the game, or you can't have fun in PVP.\nBest to stay far away from this game, unless you happen to enjoy flushing money down the toilet.","September 25, 2014","false","8.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Though the population favored katanas and Shotguns, always loving the Red Blood and single pistol for the challenge.  When MAIET announced this I got excited to think this would be a major updated version of it, with possibly the same weapons and armor, new stuff as well, updated graphics, When this game launched things have turned really quickly, feels more controlled instead of free.  Lack of gear, lack of fun...  Unfortunately now this game is just another empty lobby simulator.  I was also hoping a story that actually catches you, not something that you see from any other game.  I even remember when they promised that anything can be used as a weapon as well, including debris from the map, that had to be changed when MAIET lost a few members and so on...

This game was broken by the classes they added and any sort of competetive aspect of this game is more about who can exploit class strengths and weaknesses.\n\nGunz one had a tough learning curve because there was actually things to learn, like how to lead shot, chain dashes, look for opportunities, and when to fight and when to run - fighting tooth and nail, gracefully. And I say that BEFORE taking into account K-style and the more difficult things to do in that game.\n\nGunz 2? Spam your skills, wait for an opportunity to cheese someone to death, and pay to win. Granted ijji-Gunz had the cash shop and some pretty OP gear from time to time it didn't RUIN the game if you were good in my opinion, and you could always go back to I-Gunz and stay on your server.\n\nGunz 2 is an embarassment to the name and the good memories from the years I spent playing the original Gunz, I'm surprised Steam has kept it on.  The only thing I could MAYBE give kudos to is the quest missions for the interesting boss fight and the attempted story line, but that's far from the reason anyone wants to play Gunz - not to mention it's just as buggy as the original Gunz quests...","August 18, 2014","false","20.9"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","1"

GunZ 1 never really made them money, and this game's free to play too, so there's not much they can do.\n----------------------------------------------ACTUAL REVIEW------------\nThe game is good. Classes are welcome, as they add new elements into the gameplay, regardless if they are gimmicky.  It's quite noob-friendly, and has PvE and PvP. The PvE is repetitive, albeit a bit challenging based upon the amount of players you have.  PvP is where the game focuses on, and it is well worth it.  It has some of the basic gameplay elements of the first game, such as wall climbing/running, dashing, melee, and such.  Some people think that the game has lost the butterfly and dash cancelling, which isn't true.  It is still there, albeit with slightly different execution.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VULDtQp_1Tk\nThere are also new weapons within the game with their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of usually solely shotguns and revolvers in the metagame, there are classes that all have their own guns, such as g launchers, snipers, machine guns, and more.  In this one you die quick compared to the original one, and you can sometimes be instantly killed, by getting headshot or by getting hit by a special attack.  This can sometimes turn away new players.\n\nThe more you play, the more levels you get, and also, the more money you get.\n\nHere's the issues I have with the game: the strongest equipment is all down to luck.  They are found in the Tesla Shop.  When you play games, you will sometimes get ores/crystals that you use here for a lottery ticket for equipment.  The more tries that have been used for that item by you or players around the world, the better your chances.\nUnfortunately, this means you will very rarely get the items you want. Usually, you get random equipment that 1) you already have, or 2) is worse than the ones you have or 3) you don't want.  When this happens, all you can do is salvage the equipment into tokens. Then there's the premium shop, where it's even more costly, and is even worse on chances.  These have the best weapons in the game with bonus effects and, the best reason of all, look cooler (because this means you automatically win, right?).  These are mostly the same items you can find in the normal shop, without special effects.  The weapons can come with fire, lightning, or more.  The armor comes in sets, and have the highest stats in the game for armor. When someone successfully rolls for these, it is announced along the top or bottom line, along with the chances for that item being reset to default (the lowest chances possible).  I've rolled in the premium shop possibly thirty times, and I was lucky enough that I got an electrified sword for Ivan.\n\nAnother huge issue is that there are no servers for the game, other than the ones made by players.  In other words, peer to peer connection.  There are no regions either: as far as the game is concerned, you're just somewhere on Earth. And if you're on Earth playing this game, that means you're put in the only player pool.  Meaning, you get matched with people like brazilians, polynesians, whatever (or rather, wherever). I do not blame the company for it, though, seeing as they didn't get money from their original game, and they can barely get money from this one.\n\nShould you play this game?\nYes.  At least, give it a try. If you don't like it, then just leave, but don't start being the people who put negative reviews like "0/10 don't play". If you're going to negatively review it, atleast REVIEW the game.","April 22, 2015","true","16.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

This is a fast paced 3rd person shooter multiplayer game that allows you to execute gravity defying moves. Unlike the first Gunz many advanced techniques were removed and the game is now fit for casual and the more hardcore gamers on this franchise. Though free to play you can buy items from the microtransaction shop. There is a gambling system called the Tesla Shop, which uses purified ores and purified crystals, which are a type of currency in Gunz 2. This game has a player hosting system which allows players with the best suitable network to host the server, which may cause lag and is still a work in progress. There are so far 6 classes with different unique playstiles and different set of achievements, Gold and Ores are easy to get without using the microtransaction shop.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinobi-kun/recommended/242720/","shinobi-kun","Shinobi-kun","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shinobi-kun/","9 products in account","Think Perfect World Entertainment. Think RNG and cash sinks.\nAnd unbalanced PVP, with lag, with queue systems that half the time you spent doing nothing until you get into a session.\nMelee in PVP is an absolute (even guaranteed) clusterf@!#. Oftentimes you don't even realized that the guy you're trying to hit may be your ally and that most players are using the same character with the same aesthetics / appearance.\n\nNow we move onto the characters. Players can choose from a wide spectrum of characters each with their own playstyles and equipment restrictions (bar a few characters).\nI like this part, but what imagine happens when you pit 2 players together, 1 comes with a sword, a slow firing and weak hitting sniper rifle, a rapid-firing but highly inaccurate after a few shots peashooter and the other a mace, a moderately fast-firing albeit slower a few margins, harder-hitting assault rifle carrying more ammo and a grenade launcher for the Lord's sake. Oh, and all the characters move so sluggish that everybody had to perform 'dashes' (double tap for...you know, dash, a la Megaman double tap dashing). Plus stun-lock melee. Guaranteed you'd stun-lock them to all Oblivion and get stun-locked in turn.\n\nPVE. Close to Hazard Ops-style. But you don't stand a chance going Solo and that PVE balancing is so damn balanced, you'd think you're playing PVP but against dumber-than-dumb AI bots. And OP bosses. OP bosses with 1 hit KOs, x50 health bars and are superior bullet sponges. If you run out of Revival Coins (think coins for arcades, Metal Slug etc), don't expect to continue your session, just drop out in less than a set time or get kicked instead. Or pray your surviving teammates lose and get your exp. There's no option to purchase coins while in-game either and you can only get coins by purchasing them via microtransactions or daily log-in rewards. (You don't get them everyday.)\n\nMarket. I don't even know why'd they bother with the in-game currency (gold, currency farmed by playing and not real cash). Almost all the items of the same category cost the same. And very rarely those weapons are better compared to the rest. Gives off a sense of variety but you'd probably be disappointed, I know I am.\n\nAnd let's talk about the lottery system. Players are probably better off with the market instead of this because most of the time you'd get a random timed item that may or may not help you at all which most of the time you'd get a timed version of an item readily available in the market. And you waste your hard-earned crystals and ores.\n*Crystals and ores are used in the Tesla machine (lottery).\nBut if you're lucky, you'd get some of the mostly-coined 'privileged items'. Some looked pretty good, while some just plain look dumb. They even have a black / purple version of Captain America's mask-suit combo.\n\nGraphics. They're okay but just so-so. They focus more on character details and lesser on the maps / background objects etc. Expect obvious mesh clippings, though.\n\nAnimations. While they, without doubt, look good, it is only so much good they could do. Animations are slow, ragdoll physics are sub-par, and check those legs out when they gun n' run, they even keep their backs straight up 90 degrees as if they're standing at attention.\n\nMusic. They're good, but I get the feeling that they lack drive or motivation. Like most of the time they don't even fit the theme or the situation players are in.\n\nVoice acting. Honestly, I was shocked. They're pretty damn good when it comes to NPC dialogues in Campaign. Sadly, voice acting only kicks in in boss fights (towards the best of my knowledge). Player characters' voice acting? Some are okay, some just sound strained with shoddily imitated accents (Elena with the assault rifles and the noobtube). Not all of the characters speak the same language though. Some spoke English, some spoke Korean.\n\nIt lags in PVP, but not so in PVE because PVP groups you randomly with players from neighboring countries or globally. And when it lags, you gonna get wrecked. Stun-locks or group stun-locking, getting sniped off or riddled with bullets while downed. (Yes, you can shoot people doubled over to death and is highly encouraged. Apparently, people losing their footing is a close to sure fire way to donate points to the enemy team). And I think the only way to prevent that is to level up and get that level-specific skill to which that has escaped my mind.\nDoesn't matter much, expect things to go wrong even when you've done it right.\n\nLike some of the reviews here on Steam. Jiggly breast physics and underwear are among the few 'goods' here.\n\nPlayer matchmaking in PVP. Aside from the notoriously, infamously 'queue' queuing system, you'd think they done good with the matchmaking. Nope. Good luck going against veteran players with the aforementioned 'privilege items' and better 1 hit KO skills and better stats. And lag. Usually, the enemy team might prefer to lag alongside their teammates instead of changing hosts. Why? They get to lag the entire session but with the chosen host as their chosen Hero. Because he isn't affected by the lag.\n\nAnd player's are vulnerable to getting reported by temperamental players throwing fits of tantrum or just because they alone lagged (8 players, 7 doing fine, 1 lagging). Democracy don't work there, folks.\n\nIt has potential, but sadly, it may require an overhaul of the current build. I do not recommend it.\nBut hey, to each their own.","August 26, 2014","false","9.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

One of the only reasons I quit playing it was due to some pretty bad carpal tunnel. I remember making myself learn to K-Style and D-Style. I remember going naked so I could carry 2 rocket launchers and lol spam rockets in death matches while flying off the walls. Gunz was a great time with an extremely high skillcap. So how does Gunz 2 match up?\n\nThe first thing I noticed was the movement. Although individual character movement seems slowed down the feel of combat is still extremely fast paced. You can no longer keep dashing into a wall to keep yourself afloat and dashing is much slower in this game with more time in between each dash. I remember being to dash 2-3 times in a single jump in Gunz 1, where in this I might get 2 sometimes.\n\nThe most obvious and controversal thing is the removal of K-Style. People who couldnt learn K-Style complained about it being a glitch and not suppose to be in the game. People that did learn found it to be a fundamental aspect of what made Gunz, Gunz. While K-Style is gone the overall idea of it still exists. K-Style was used because it was the ultimate offensive and defensive playstyle. You basically were a constant moving target that could not only defend but also attack very quickly with your sword. It essentially covered all your bases.\n\nYou can still block and move in Gunz 2 but not at the speed you used to. Also attacks are now comboed so you can not constantly butterfly to attack.\n\nI will now explain the 2 main gameplay changes that seem to seperate it from Gunz 1.\n\nFirst is that in Gunz 1, the sword was the main weapon. It did everything except attack at range. I've done and seen people kill multiple people just by butterflying even when they used guns. In Gunz 2 there is an increase movement to using ranged weapons. Your melee weapon is great when the enemy gets close, but anything outside sweep range you are basically wanting to stick to your guns.\n\nSecond is the more emphasis on team play. Gunz 1 was more about who had the best player. A single elite player could take on a team of 4 by himself in Gunz 1. This is no longer as easy in Gunz 2. The class system also further emphasizes it. I found the class system to be interesting and similar to TF2 in that basically every class has a counter.\n\nClasses:\n\nThe Silent Avenger is basically your extreme range and extreme close range specialist. Their weapons are swords, SMG's, and Sniper Rifles. They are great at really far range sniping and when they get in close their SMG's and swords make quick work of enemies. They are not great at medium range or groups and their counter is the Gunslinger because she can basically defeat him at any range outside extreme close and extreme range.\n\nThe Shadow Dancer reminds me of the closest thing to Gunz other than the Silent Avenger. Quick and fast, she specializes on killing enemies that don't see her and is amazing against 1v1. A good tactical Shadow Dancer can take on multiple enemies quite easily with her decoy skill however. Her counter is the Silent Avenger. Better at ranged combat and having just as good melee, she has a hard time against SA's.\n\nThe Gunslinger is your ranged class obviously. Her Assault Rifle does great damage at medium range and her grenade launcher is the only current indirect weapon, meaning you can lob it around corners and other places too set up traps. She excels at ranged combat and against groups however she is poor 1v1 and at close range the high rate of fire of the SD and SA's weapons makes mincemeat of her. Her counter is the Shadow Dancer because she can easily get within the GS's range and jungle her to her doom.\n\nFinally is the Shield Trooper. He is like the Heavy from TF2. He is amazing at close/medium range thanks to her Minigun and Flamer. He also excels at fighting groups. Where the gunslinger is better at medium/long-indirect fire, the Shield Trooper is better at Close-Medium range gun damage. He is kind of a wild card in terms of counters. He can easily get beat medium range against Gunslingers, but if he gets in range, youre boned. SD's can dash around him all they want but his health and no juggle make him hard to kill. SA's can snipe him, but if he gets close,, again, its a bad thing. Basically all classes counter him and he counters all classes.\n\nOverall the gameplay reminds me of Gunz 1 with just a different feeling. It is without a doubt extremely fun. There wasn't a moment in the couple hours I've played so far that I was bored. The best way I can explain it is like Resident Evil series going from 3 to 4. 4 turned the game into more action oriented, but it wasn't a bad thing, it was quite good. It didn't feel like Resident Evil, but it was a fun game in it's own right. Gunz 2 doesn't quite feel like Gunz 1, but I think it will be a great game and I can already see people coming up with new techniques for it.\n","February 20, 2014","true","43.5"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I can however write a review based on my experience with this game, so here goes. (I'm gonna type this as I go, might revise a few things here and there) To start off, for an early access game, this is beautiful. Gameplay is fast-paced and exciting, controls are fluid and responsive, and everything I've seen has been aesthetically appealing (How the aesthetics look could be different for other players, because the game sets a default graphical setting depending on your computer. Mine was defaulted to low, but today I decided to try a higher setting, and going from low to medium is like going from 8-bit to 1040p HD. Anyways...) So far the game has been very good. I love the diversity in character weapons and skills, and each character I've played (all but Elena so far) has been fun in a unique way. There are many different strategies that can be used with each class, which keeps playstyle diverse even when multiple people play the same character. However, as much as I love this game and don't want to say anything bad about it, I kind of have to give some constructive criticism here so the developers can continue to improve it. Firstly, although its not too big a deal, there is a little bit of balancing issue with some of the characters. I know with this much variety its hard to keep perfect balance between classes, and the developers have done a wonderful job with the balancing, but two weapon types in specific need to be addressed here. There's Max's flamethrower, which is extremely overpowered in close quarters, and there's Elena's grenade launcher. I haven't noticed too much abuse with the grenade launcher, but for balance I would reccomend making it damage the user and/or making it less accurate. I have, however, noticed a very large ammount of flamethrower abuse. To prevent this, I would reccomend decreasing the range, as well as damage or ammo capacity. Second off, I realize that with a free to play title developers need to find a way to make money. I can understand in-game purchases and feel they are justified, but only to so much extent. There are a few things that should be changed, for the developers' benefit (look, more people will buy things if theyre cheaper) and for the players' benefit (more fun stuff for everyone). #1, I really want to play through the campaign, but its impossible without spending a ton of money on revival coins. I havent actually checked how much they are, but from what I've heard, theyre 5 bucks a pop. Sure, you dont HAVE to play campaign, but I find it enjoyable sometimes to kill a bunch of weak enemies instead of get the crap beat out of me by other players. If they were to lower the price on them, (or better yet get rid of them) I would be very happy, or even if they would mess with a few of the numbers so enemies don't 3-shot you and drop more med-kits. #2, I enjoy having horse masks and top hats as much as the next guy, but people probably arent going to buy them at 10-15 dollars each. I probably would have bought one by now if they weren't so damned expensive, because I love this game and want to support it, but dont want to spend $40 on accessories. #3, I hate to be nit-picky, but each character has a "starting kit" available for purchase that comes with a costume and a good weapon. While I dont see anything wrong with that, the price tag on each one is a whopping $35, and that was when it said %50 off. I know after all that it may seem like I berated the game, but if it did that wasnt my intent. I intended for the developers to read this and maybe take my suggestions, so that a great game can get even better. While I didnt talk about the good as much as the bad, I felt it would be difficult (and boring for any of you that read this) to try and stretch out the positive more than I needed to. In conclusion, this is an excellent game and I most certainly reccomend playing it, but I dont really reccomend planning on too many purchases unless your wallet has a lot of money in it. I'd give this game around an 8.5 to a 9 out of 10. If you actually read down to here, congratulations, you'll probably be able to tolerate school text books if you havent gotten through school already. Thank you for reading this, and have a wonderful day full of gaming. That about sums it up, cya! :) (Edit: Forgot to mention, the music is top-notch. Theres not a ridiculous ammount of tracks, but the ones they do have are really good and never get old)","March 19, 2014","true","55.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","4"

I really love third-person shooters and it's a huge plus how fast-paced GunZ 2 is. But there's a problem with the way connection works here. In GunZ 2, the host server is a random player. There's no proper server that everyone connects to, therefore not all games will be fair (some refuse to change the host in fear that they will lose to better players, who are most likely lagging). Expect to be a decent player with a good kill-death ratio, but in some matches, go 3 kills with 12 deaths because the host's connection can't support itself plus 7 people.\n\nThat's the ONLY problem I have with it. I'd probably find myself playing this game more often if they just fixed that issue and got a proper server.","April 27, 2014","false","28.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I was passionate about the first GunZ. It was the first game that I played extensively online and will always have a warm place in my heart, so I had a lot of expectations going into this game. It doesn't feel even in the slightest to be in any way similar to the first GunZ but it is still an okay game. The issue is the first installment in the series died out due to the mass amount of hacks that released for it and how easily it was to cheat. I played this game for a weekend and then the next weekend when I logged in I went four games straight with a hacker on my team or on the opposing one. It took a while for hackers to take over the first installment and it seems this will fall like the first had before it even gets a lot of attention, which is to say the least... pathetic.","April 27, 2014","false","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe if it allowed for custom games or maybe if it had dedicated servers instead of letting some random guy host then maybe it would be worth it. But my experience so far after reaching level 8 is a mix of unsatisfaction and irritation. The game is decided almost immediately after it starts just by looking at who's the host and my corresponding ping to the said host and it's frustrating.\n\nBut I will not dwell more on that because thankfully the game gives me more to harp about.\n\nGraphics:\n\nYes, the game indeed surpasses its original but you've seen this kind of detail before and even better. In fact, I can even dare say that this falls off compared to some games because there are some actions that are not rendered too well. The characters you can choose from are lack-lustered and it wouldn't be too annoying if you had morethan four to choose from, i am not too sure if you can change hairstyles later on cause as I said I am only level 8 but the inability to do so even at my level makes looking at my character a chore.\n\nPlot:\n\nThe previous gunz didn't have this but now we have a campaign mode. It's always a good thing for me if a game has a single player mode that can help him burn his time while waiting for his friends but this campaign mode doesn't really hit that spot. The game just basically keeps spawning mobs and mobs of 'Adam Soldiers' at you until you die. Are there respawns? There are but you have to buy them with steam money.... Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ that. As I said this mode is repetitive and gets really boring really fast so I didn't even bother to finish up to the second chapter. Maybe I will when I get some of my friends to play with me. Hopefully they don't get bored and last at least two chapters.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf Gunz 2 does something right it's this. Fighting with another player is intense and exciting. The different classes add variety and forces players to incorporate strategy into their game which the old GunZ didn't have. The class specific specials look amazing and feels amazing to use! One can feel like a total badass after slicing an opponent into half with a katana as the poor victim slowly kneels on the floor electrified before he dies. A successful and cunning illusionary escape with a shadow dancer feels very satisfying after you see your fooled foe die from the explosion your illusion creates! All of these plus the already amazing wall walking mechanics now improved to make continuos wall run possible without being a validictorian at the game. You can run from walls to walls just by properly positioning your mouse and pressing the jump button without having to pause and this makes for very flashy acrobatic kills!\n\nToo bad though that no matter how good its gameplay is the fact remains that it only matters if your enemies don't stand in front of you and take the brunt of all your attacks and yet take no damage because you have too high ping due to the host living in the far side of the planet or because he has a dial up. Over and over you will hear complains in game about changing hosts and even if the host changes it's still not guaranteed that the next host will be more decent! Your only real salvation is if the system chooses you to host the game but even then, your experience will be mediocre as people who lag with you as host will soak up damage like the world's most porous sponge! Having dedicated servers instead of this kind of interface will fix this! There was lag back in the old gunz but not like this! This kind of lag makes the game almost unplayable as the good lag free games are very, very, rare.\n\nOverall gunz is a good game but I cannot recommend this game with all the lag. It's free to play so it's safe to try but I wouldn't recommend buying bundles for it because chances are you will quit this game unless you're a hardcore fan of the prequel. However, I do recommend keeping this game in your memory because if the game fixes its lag problems then it's an experience worth your money.","February 24, 2014","false","24.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This most likely happens to  the host of the game.\n-You cannot pick a room. The game chooses a room for you randomly. If you leave a room chances are you can't enter the same one.\n-Its stupid how you publish a game WHILE IT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT. The company could have at least have its own testers. THE GAMERS ARE BASICALLY TESTING THIS GAME AND THEY ARE ALREADY CHARGING REAL MONEY FOR SOMETHING THAT'S STILL DEVELOPING.\n-Game in campaign is difficult even in very easy mode. The only way you're gonna win is if you have coins which cost real money. THERE IS NO HOPE OF WINNING SOLO ON CAMPAIGN UNLESS YOU GOT REVIVAL COINS.....DOZENS OF THEM. This game was made so you spend money to finish it. The developers might as well rob me. (This game was meant for the rich, hardcore community not casual gamers)\n-Dashing and wall running does not make this unique. It really serves no purpose other than being eye candy. This game is a Devil May Cry wannabe.\n-It's all about the firearms. Melee yields little success.\n-I had a critical error happen. A window prompted me to send a report to the publishers. I wanted to but it was taking so long JUST TO SEND A REPORT. THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES WITH REGARDS TO THE QUALITY OF THE GAME.\n-This game needs a vote-kick function when playing the maps. Some players will troll and not enter the rally point, running out the time which is frustrating.\n-A game is NOT FUN if it has to make you GRIND to become better. If you want better equipment you have to buy it in the shop with gold (not real money). But then you have the problem with durability. You have to grind away at the game like a dumb robot to maintain your advantage. In other words, upkeep. GAMES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FUN, NOT FRUSTRATING. You already have the daily grind of real life, now you have to grind in a game?\n\nI'm a casual gamer. I have a life outside my monitor. So you would expect games to be fun and help you forget the troubles of the day. Not this one though. No I have not played the first GunZ.\n\nMy advice: Play it if you like a "diluted" Devil May Cry type game but don't spend your hard earned cash on something that may not take flight.\n\nI realize that being a free game the developers have to make some profit for their work, but seriously iron everything out in this game. I have no problem paying real money for a decent, enjoyable game.\n\nP.S. I DARE THE DEVELOPERS TO PLAY THIS "GAME" THAT THEY CALL AND SEE HOW IT MAKES THEM FEEL. DO NOT PAY TO WIN. PLAY LEGIT.","February 24, 2014","false","96.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShakemasterNixon/recommended/242720/","ShakemasterNixon","Shakemaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ShakemasterNixon/","449 products in account","As a forewarner, this game has quite possibly the worst netcode in existence. Seriously, if you aren't the host (it uses *peer-to-peer* hosting in 2014), your shots register about three-fourths of a second behind where you are currently looking, making it impossible to hit people whom are usually dashing about incessantly, meaning any character not focused on AoE or wide-arc melee will be left missing well over two-thirds of the shots tehy would have otherwise rightfully hit with. To test this yourself, play games until you get host, and notice your accuracy and kill ratio skyrocket astronomically when the game registers your shots properly.\n\nThe classes are an awful change to the GunZ system. Players are given little to no detail about each class other than a vague single-word descriptor like "heavy" or "gunslinger". When a player chooses a class, they are effectively locked into that class until they grind enough gold (which admittedly isn't hard) to try another class. Weapons are locked on a per-class basis, so to try all weapons in the game, you'll have to grind ~70000 gold (around 60 wins, up to over 100 losses) to unlock all the classes, and then an additional 15000 gold per weapon, plus upkeep costs, because there is a tumor-like durability system built into all weapons purchased with in-game money.\n\nMost of the weapons are, according to their stat bars, objectively worse than other choices. There is usually one weapon other than the default that is considered "good", with the others having severe deficiencies that make them frustrating to use. Ranged weapons, as per the awful netcode, are basically spray-and-pray with little to no skill involved, as the mental gymnastics of seeing the future to land a hit is, understandably, a bit much to ask of any human being.\n\nThe melee is overstated and overemphasized. Melee combos are unbreakable, meaning that once you've been staggered by one attack, if the enemy is in range, they are free to melee you until the comobo ends, usually with an automatic knockdown, whereupon they are free to pull out automatic weapons and spray you down for what very little of your health is left afterwards, because melee does way too much damage. As a result, you will often find yourself literally losing to knives in a gunfight because melee is basically a free 1v1 win as soon as they land one hit and lead into a combo with you being left staggered and unable to get out of the way because the netcode is so awful that by the time you've gotten down the timing to dodge out, they'll already be registering a hit on you on their screen, and then it has to go through a P2P host network, and by that point everything is a complete crapshoot except for the fact that you will automatically lose if you don't have your melee weapon out before they start hitting you. But really, if you need to have your melee weapon out before a melee gets to you because ranged weapons are severely ineffective, you might as well exclusively play Ivan and swing a katana, because by god it's the most reliable way to get a kill.\n\nThe only way to get permanent weapons is through either level-up reward crystals or through cash-shop currency, both of which run on a luck-based lottery system prevalent in many korean F2P games.\n\nOverall it's a frustrating mess of a game and wouldn't reccomend it to anyone. It's a buggy, sloppy, laggy mess of a game and  will probably be dead within half a year in its current state.","February 24, 2014","false","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Maybe if it allowed for custom games or maybe if it had dedicated servers instead of letting some random guy host then maybe it would be worth it. But my experience so far after reaching level 8 is a mix of unsatisfaction and irritation. The game is decided almost immediately after it starts just by looking at who's the host and my corresponding ping to the said host and it's frustrating.\n\nBut I will not dwell more on that because thankfully the game gives me more to harp about.\n\nGraphics:\n\nYes, the game indeed surpasses its original but you've seen this kind of detail before and even better. In fact, I can even dare say that this falls off compared to some games because there are some actions that are not rendered too well. The characters you can choose from are lack-lustered and it wouldn't be too annoying if you had morethan four to choose from, i am not too sure if you can change hairstyles later on cause as I said I am only level 8 but the inability to do so even at my level makes looking at my character a chore.\n\nPlot:\n\nThe previous gunz didn't have this but now we have a campaign mode. It's always a good thing for me if a game has a single player mode that can help him burn his time while waiting for his friends but this campaign mode doesn't really hit that spot. The game just basically keeps spawning mobs and mobs of 'Adam Soldiers' at you until you die. Are there respawns? There are but you have to buy them with steam money.... Yeah, ♥♥♥♥ that. As I said this mode is repetitive and gets really boring really fast so I didn't even bother to finish up to the second chapter. Maybe I will when I get some of my friends to play with me. Hopefully they don't get bored and last at least two chapters.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIf Gunz 2 does something right it's this. Fighting with another player is intense and exciting. The different classes add variety and forces players to incorporate strategy into their game which the old GunZ didn't have. The class specific specials look amazing and feels amazing to use! One can feel like a total badass after slicing an opponent into half with a katana as the poor victim slowly kneels on the floor electrified before he dies. A successful and cunning illusionary escape with a shadow dancer feels very satisfying after you see your fooled foe die from the explosion your illusion creates! All of these plus the already amazing wall walking mechanics now improved to make continuos wall run possible without being a validictorian at the game. You can run from walls to walls just by properly positioning your mouse and pressing the jump button without having to pause and this makes for very flashy acrobatic kills!\n\nToo bad though that no matter how good its gameplay is the fact remains that it only matters if your enemies don't stand in front of you and take the brunt of all your attacks and yet take no damage because you have too high ping due to the host living in the far side of the planet or because he has a dial up. Over and over you will hear complains in game about changing hosts and even if the host changes it's still not guaranteed that the next host will be more decent! Your only real salvation is if the system chooses you to host the game but even then, your experience will be mediocre as people who lag with you as host will soak up damage like the world's most porous sponge! Having dedicated servers instead of this kind of interface will fix this! There was lag back in the old gunz but not like this! This kind of lag makes the game almost unplayable as the good lag free games are very, very, rare.\n\nOverall gunz is a good game but I cannot recommend this game with all the lag. It's free to play so it's safe to try but I wouldn't recommend buying bundles for it because chances are you will quit this game unless you're a hardcore fan of the prequel. However, I do recommend keeping this game in your memory because if the game fixes its lag problems then it's an experience worth your money.","February 24, 2014","false","24.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Playing this game makes me happy and sad at the same time, GunZ had K-Style (yes i'm going to QQ about K-style, it was amazingly well and was what made the game exciting yet addicting) The level limit is quite annoying, and I wish it had more features from GunZ: The Duel, However, GunZ 2 : The Second Duel has unique additions along with frequent server monitoring and, apart from all the new features, it is in Early Acess. I've been waiting for around 8 years for this game, and I would recommend a 7 or 8 out of 10 ( 7/10 or 8/10), it could use some prequel features, but I believe the developers will not let their fans down on the upcoming game, so I keep my head high. Some might not be able to play this game due to the server cap being 1,500, but I HIGHLY doubt it will stay like this for a lot of time. Posting negative comments on the discussions help marvelously, but posting stupid, unevidental hate on this game not only annoys the community, but might aswell as the moderators and developers. Whilst it is ok to provide negative feedback on this upcoming game, keep in mind to be respectful to these people and to contribute with evidence. This game has more potential than GunZ: The Duel, with extra help from the fans of Maiet Entertainment, and while this game came out  on 2011 and has been translated for our own use in 2014, I still am priviledge to get a taste of the game and move along with the game aswell.","February 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakrave/recommended/242720/","breakrave","Subhuman Scum™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakrave/","271 products in account","Disclaimer: The following is a review/retrospective of the intial impact of Gunz 2: The Second Duel - EARLY ACCESS/LAUNCH DAYS.\n\n[The TL;dr]\n-Server issues make this hard to enter, easy to put down.\n-Looks alright\n-Soundtrack inferior to first Gunz: The Duel\n-Pay advantage is present. Increased damage/health for those who buy certain items.\n-Cash shop is expensive | RNG elements for free players (Gear modification.)\n-Free play will fall upon playtime, meaning that if you get a weapon - in most cases, it will be a temporary (6 hours, example) item. No permanent value without spending $ in early stages.\n-Game is near-unplayable due to server congestion. Once inside, it's a smooth ride.\n-Gameplay as fast, furious, and frustrating if you don't have prior experience within the game. Learning ceiling isn't "Extreme High" like Gunz, but high enough. Prepare to die and be useless to your team lots unless your opponents are on equal footing, which is doubtful this early.\n\n-Reccomendation: Barely yes. It's not fun when the 1,100 people that never log out are over your skill and literal ingame level because they actually got in. Skill variance and coping with being made a bullet-catcher is going to be a make or break for new entrants into the arena of GunZ:2\n\nEdit: Due to elite macro skills, I have a way into the game. Still, the good is far outweighed by the bad. If you're a masochist, the recommendation is still there - but the game isn't fun. Not particularly.\n\n[Loser's Perspective: Gunz2 - The Duel]\n\n\nInstallation went smoothly, as I started the game I know I'd never succeed in. It's pointless - but the vast majority of games on PC these days are multiplayer. Shooters, Racers, MMO's. Whatever - I need to kill time, and this is how. I had fond memories of Gunz being ruined by hackers and elitists, and upon hearing that the "elitist tool" known as K-Styling was removed, I figured I'd give it a try.\n\nLittle did I know, I'd not get to try for quite some time. 2 full days of ~10 hour attempts of logging in alongside a normal work day, and I still didn't get in. MAIET is sure showing a convenience to the Steam playerbase!\n\n2 days and 4 hours later total from release, I finally managed to get into the game, make a character, and drop into the tutorial. Easy enough - the tutorial fails to tell you just how easily you'll die, though. Guess it's implied with the mobility techniques they drill you through.\n\nFirst real match within the game was PvE just to see how my computer would run it. Ran great, and the PvE is surprisingly tough. Ammo disappears in instants due to just how many enemies there are, and the game only gives you one life. If you want to rise again after death, you spend a token - once you run out, you pay real money to replenish your stock of them. (Even Dungeon Fighter had free tokens replenished daily. Come on now. MAIET is more jewish than Nexon?)\n\nRegardless, overwhelming enemy odds and bad players rendered me the last survivor, and I too, succumbed to enemy forces. Inevitable loss. But that's not why you're playing Gunz. You're playing Gunz to ♥♥♥♥ on people and make them ragequit like any other multiplayer ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a game, right?\n\nThere's a mode just for you - Elimination. It combines the stupidity of one hit deaths in general in a game where you have to buy health and armor to survive, with the "one life system" similar to that in Counter-Strike. Die? You're out for the round, bye! I'll be the first to say that going against level 15 opponents in a game where levels DO INTRODUCE NEW SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES for battle as a level 1 had the most obvious outcome. 0/5/0. A straight loss.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, but only when everyone can log in and the pool of players isn't "pros vs new players who can't get a shot in edgewise." If they had level-capped matchmaking perhaps, it'd be fun. Right now, it's a fight just to get into this ♥♥♥♥, let alone actually play it.\n\nOnce inside, if you aren't getting carried, you're getting dumped on and made useless. No point to do anything but play until the game randomly kicks you for getting a surprise kill. There's no in between. Win, or lose HORRIBLY. If you can get by that? It's a recommend. Loadout's a fun alternative that offers counterplay at the cost of not being able to wall run. I'll take that.","February 19, 2014","false","59.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The gameplay itself is quite enjoyable. Campaign mode is fun, deathmatches are not bad, so long as you end up with people that aren't a much higher level than you and have reasonable pings.\n\nThat being said, even ignoring the difficulty getting into the server, there are still some pretty significant drawbacks. The class system, for one thing, is pretty awful. You are stuck with the class you choose at the start until you mange to accumulate 10k gold for all the other classes except shadow dancer, which you need 50k for (Unless you choose it initially). There appears to be some sort of crafting system, though I have yet to figure out how it works. You get 3 lives to use in campaign mode per period of time (I think probably per day, but I'm not sure). After that it is three dollars to bring yourself back to life. However, it is still quite fun.\n\nAll in all, the actual core game has some promise, but I'm pretty disappointed with the lag, class system, unintuitive item crafting, and the $3 pricetag on campaign mode continues.","February 20, 2014","true","109.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolius7/recommended/242720/","coolius7","Coolius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coolius7/","100 products in account","Prepare to be frustrated. Prepare to be mercilessly beaten by better players over and over again. Prepare to constantly think, "No way! That's totally broken!" Prepare to have an open mind and realize that while, yes, the balance between classes is a little skewed, it all boils down to player skill. Prepare to stay mobile, for a stationary player is quickly killed. Prepare to spam your directional keys, yell at your screen, and sometimes even win. Prepare to have a lot of fun... if you're willing to learn and get better.\n\nFor those familiar with Gunz 1, the sequal is essentially the same, but with the removal of animation cancelling, and everyone has about a third as much health. In addition, everyone has a melee weapon, a short range weapon (usually smg of some sort), and a long range weapon (sniper/mortar/etc.). Combat is still frantic, and even moreso frantic now that deaths happen so quickly due to low hp. Also, successful execution of a melee chain usually results in death.\n\nThe campaign mode is back, and is much more robust than before. However, the reduction of player health pools makes it... well, a little different than before. If you try to just jump in and melee, you will die. Quickly. However, it's still fun, and even has a story connected to it.\n\nWhile the game does have a slight pay-to-win aspect to it, the advantages you gain are minor, and mobility and aim are so important that a better player will beat a worse one regardless of the gear/class equipped. Either way, the game is free-to-play, so go ahead and give it a shot.","February 21, 2014","true","15.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninengel/recommended/242720/","roninengel","Xion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninengel/","147 products in account","I've been a fan of the Gunz series for quite some time, even with all the ups and downs the original Gunz had gone through. Really the only thing that drove me away from the first was the invasion of hackers, either wise I'd probably would've been playing it until this finally launched.\nLet me make something clear that this game definitely has taken another route than the original Gunz template laid out. Mainly the whole "style" attributes are gone but I do believe this helped open the game up to many more players as well as bring a lot more importance onto every aspect the game has to offer, instead of just a small segment. The customization, while not currently as diverse as I'd like, has the potential for a lot of growth. Currently there are 4 classes and most of them boast weapons unique to their class. The only similarity currently is Ivan (Silent Avenger) and Rena (Shadow Dancer) sharing the same automatic weapon type (an SMG). However they all have a firearm that is unique to them as well as a melee weapon that is unique to them as well that have quite the diverse abilities for them. Rena for instance wields two short sword nodachis (the game calls them daggers for some reason) and as a result she has the longest combo both on ground and air. She is also, I believe, the fastest character in the bunch; though all of them are pretty quick. While on the other hand you have Max, who wields a giant melee shield into battle. This shield may be a bit slow and boasting a low combo count, but it certainly hurts to get hit with. Not to mention he has the only block that completely protects against most firearms. His trade off is being one of the slowest classes and also having a pretty short reach with his firearms, though you can get some lucky shots with the minigun.\n\nBut I do like that each character is now unique. In the original Gunz, there were several classes to choose from but I never really noticed any difference between them besides what weapons they started off with (which could all be changed to whatever you wanted later on). Now I mentioned customization is a bit lax atm as all the classes are pretty much restricted to their own weaponry currently. I don't know if they plan to allow mixing up weapons later on or keeping them restricted to help make the classes stand out, we'll just have to see where it goes.\n\nNow the only major drawback to this game so far has been on the server side of things. Unfortunately it is quite a bit difficult getting into the game (with the low server capacity cap, currently only 4500). However another server side issue is the downside to peer to peer network. Unfortunately lag plays a huge factor when it comes to fast paced games and even with a strong connection, you can end up with a nasty lag situation all depending on who the host is. There aren't really any official servers people play on but more so user hosted matches. This ultimately can lead to many instances where some players can connect just fine but others have horrible connections or spike all over the place, simply because of the distance to the current host. Now the host can be changed via an option to help mitigate this issue, but unfortunately you're still at the mercy of whoever is in the room. While someone's own internet may be pretty good, that doesn't necessarily make them ideal hosts. Not to mention that the more people trying to connect to one game, the worse a lag situation can get. I discovered this issue playing Tenchu Z on the Xbox 360. The multiplayer lag in that game increases expotentially depending on how many participants are in the group (max 4 players). At 4 players, the game is essentially unplayable for anyone but the host. However when you remove that 4th person, at 3 players the game is a lot more stable. Likewise dropping it down to 2 people, depending on who is hosting, there may be little to no lag at all. But it never mattered who was hosting or how good their connection was, the second a 4th player was involved, the match would always lag horribly.\n\nNow the devs for Gunz 2 are working on increasing the server capacity and trying to improve their network to help make the experience much more stable for everyone but that stuff takes time. However, that is why the game is in an early-access stage (something many players tend to forget). There are many improvements to be made and stuff to add to the game to make it an amazing experience. However, Gunz 2 certainly can be an amazing title as long as it could pull its act together and remain strong, especially for a free-to-play title. Which by the way, they took a bit note from the original Gunz in how to handle the free-to-play market. There was a big divide between players who bought their gear in game and players who purchased better gear using actual currency, essentially creating a pay-to-win model. Though Gunz 2 handles this well by only having cosmetic things attached to the real currency, while every gear piece can be purchased with in game currency. Definitely an improvement and something that lets many new players come enjoy the game without feeling at a disadvantage because they don't want to make a real money investment to a game they may or may not spend a lot of time with. Now people who want to put a little cash into their characters can help make themselves stand out and feel unique, without gaining an unfair advantage over other players.","February 20, 2014","true","217.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Playing this game makes me happy and sad at the same time, GunZ had K-Style (yes i'm going to QQ about K-style, it was amazingly well and was what made the game exciting yet addicting) The level limit is quite annoying, and I wish it had more features from GunZ: The Duel, However, GunZ 2 : The Second Duel has unique additions along with frequent server monitoring and, apart from all the new features, it is in Early Acess. I've been waiting for around 8 years for this game, and I would recommend a 7 or 8 out of 10 ( 7/10 or 8/10), it could use some prequel features, but I believe the developers will not let their fans down on the upcoming game, so I keep my head high. Some might not be able to play this game due to the server cap being 1,500, but I HIGHLY doubt it will stay like this for a lot of time. Posting negative comments on the discussions help marvelously, but posting stupid, unevidental hate on this game not only annoys the community, but might aswell as the moderators and developers. Whilst it is ok to provide negative feedback on this upcoming game, keep in mind to be respectful to these people and to contribute with evidence. This game has more potential than GunZ: The Duel, with extra help from the fans of Maiet Entertainment, and while this game came out  on 2011 and has been translated for our own use in 2014, I still am priviledge to get a taste of the game and move along with the game aswell.","February 19, 2014","true","1.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConcreteEnema/recommended/242720/","ConcreteEnema","MB Shoober","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ConcreteEnema/","631 products in account","Long winded review\nGunz: The Duel was an all time favourite of mine in terms of Online gaming. It had three things that would attract any testosterone filled young male to its seductive grasp: Guns, Swords, and acrobatically combining them along with flexible coats and scarves for extra Flair. I spent months grinding to level 20, relishing every battle and every lesson I learned to get that flexi coat. Naturally I felt inclined to play the long awaited sequel/reboot to theis all time high speed Third person shoot-em-up.\nTo specify a number of things the Original game had: there was a character customization system, with a wide array of weaponry and outfits each with attributes to suit different play styles, an incredibly high speed parkour system that required both skill to use and to shoot at, very reasonable ping games due to popularity and localization, as well as compatibility with most graphics cards due to the 2006-era appearance. On top of all this, Gunz' main draw was that it seamlessly (for its time) integrated the use of firearms and swords as weapons in battle, no fight was just a firefight or just a swordfight, each weapon type had strenghts and weaknesses to comabt each other, and players were required to use guile to use this to their advantage.\nWhat does New GunZ2 has? Does it back this up, Does it immprove on this? does it have an even better system?\nNo.\ncharacter customization? enjoy having a selection of one of four racial sterotype, cookie cutter, CLASS BASED, "Actors", bear in mind you have to pay micro transactions if you blindly make the wrong decision, as you cannot test each class out.\nWide array of gear? ♥♥♥♥ that, have a choice of three aesthetic costumes and barely a handful of Class based guns that have only slightly varied stats\nParkour system?I have no idea how they managed it, but they seem to have made parkour the single slowest part of the game, not to mention painfully user unfriendly. It seems like they were catering to americlap babies who couldnt keep up with experienced koreans. In fact, it seems that the parkour only remains as a tribute to its predecessor for which it was so revered. I could easily see that GunZ 2 was designed, and then some chaep system was thrown in at the end for parkour. its insulting\nWhat about ping and graphics lag? welcome to APB Reloaded, only you live in australia, and the servers are still in the US. no matter what your ping is, you're gonna get shot through walls or have that random asian cat magically teleport behind you and stunlock you with their swords.\non the topic of APB reloaded, the new GunZ shares the same, miserably colourful art design. the old game had an art style of muted colors gothic hallways and an all-in-all grim and gritty feel. the new one simply looks like they took a level of street fighter (and characters) mashed it to fit a basic CS:S layout and called it good art.\nFinally, gun-to-sword combat. This is what GunZ is famous for, right? this must be what's coming through to prevail for the new game?\nNOPE, NO DICE.\nGun. always. trumps. sword.\nDiscarding the fact that the game designers ignored the existence of assault rifles, you can pretty much bet that the nly reason people run into one another with blades is either to depserately try and scarpe any of the old exhiliration from the old game, or they're simply trying to stunlock the other guy until he dies (which is a thing. a very bad thing. That I exploited and won every match with).\nThere is no tension, no risk that someone on the enemy team might have a knife making you wish you picked kodachi. the worst you have to worry about is "oh, someone was stupid enough to pic shieldguy? nvm I flanked him he's dead now"\n\nShould you play GunZ2?\nIf you want to see how maiet have successfully managed to cripple the name of an amazing game by producing the exact opposite, and you have no concerns wasting your time which is better spent playing an actual game.\neven then No. go play an actual game. this is one of the worst pieces of ♥♥♥♥ I have ever played. Uninstall it from your computer and use that memory space on a game worth playing, such as the Original Gunz: The Duel\n","February 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After the 5 year wait, I can say, the game has delivered on the hype. Seeing all the effort the team made by developing such a great starting screen, full of expensive lightning particles (must have taken many years to develop that), and bright lights, has truly made me understand why it took so long to make the sequel to Gunz 1. The starting screen is so amazing that you won't even be mad when you can't get past the screen because your keyboard does not contain 'any key'. Once Riot finally allows you to enter the game, you'll be greeted with an amazing lobby system and a full functioning cash shop that will provide you with all the great items to smash your enemies (you don't even need to spend time to get the items!) After spending hours upon hours of trying to start a game, I finally called it a night.

This game is nothing like the original Gunz: The Duel. It is very sad and made Maiet look bad. They promised K_style, j_style, none of those can be done in Gunz 2 the sesond Duel. In fact, Gunz 2 is a completely new game without much to expect in my humble opinion. Basicaly, Gunz 2 is unique in its own way but lacks what Gunz 1 had: bugs.\nIt may sound weird but the bugs  of Gunz the Duel was what made the game so popular: fast passed styles that were done using the sword and the wapons of your chioce (ie: K_style) that uses the sword to move (dash) and the shutguns to shoot at point black distance.

And I mean A LOT, of the Original GunZ. So I had high expectations when playing this game.\nWas I disappointed? Yes.\nWas it so bad I would stop playing it? No.\nThe original GunZ had a few things that are missing in the new one. First off, what I see as "K-Style" in the game, appears to be I would say not really "K-style" as it is so easy and oddly ineffective. The ineffectiveness comes from the fact that many people are just running around shooting you which is way more effective here than it was in the first game. Also, classes are an intresting thing I didn't find myself as happy as I should've been. The original GunZ didn't have classes; so if you wanted to be a grenade launching maniac with a shotgun and a pair of dual katanas, go right ahead. Here you're restricted to the weapons your class is alotted to. Such as a Sword, SMG, and Sniper rifle for one class, or a Mace, Assault Rifle, and Grenade Launcher for another. Also, many of these classes I find to be a tad broken. By broken I either mean overpowered. Max, for example is just a running Pain Train that can flamethrower you in seconds before you can even defend yourself. Like you'd have to be extremely lucky to avoid a flamethrower Max. Plus Max's weaknesses, can only count in games such as Team Deathmatch. Max in Team Elimination? Better hope you hit first, because you can't parry or block if he does. And it's not only Max, some characters have a sense brokeness in one way or another. In particular, Wayne's wide range stunlock whip, or Rose's stunlock High damage Rocket Launcher.\nThis next line was supposed to comment on the how screwed you are if you're ping was too high, but then again, Maiet is based in South Korea, so I'll cut them a little slack, as much as I hate lagging in EVERY GAME.\nAnother annoying thing I found was the Campaign. I remember the Old Campaign as being a fun round for a few games that you could've done yourself. I always used the old Campaign as a way to practice my "K-Style" when none of my friends were on. Now, Campaign is a gamemode I just can't play anymore as it is next to impossible to complete on your own. The First Level is still isn't done for me. And the fact that it is has a time limit, really makes it unecessarily challenging for those who play Campaign on their own, like me. Additonally, Campaign for me was fighting Goblins, Lizards, and Skeletons, that was more interesting than fighting a bunch of soldiers who can't fight seem know which end of the rifle is the shooty end.\nAs much as I complained and ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the crap above me, I'll talk about why I still play it.\nApart from experiencing good ol' nostalgia, its still the same challenge I had when I first started the Original GunZ. I still get the same feeling of acomplishment when I knock a Max into the air and headshot him so I can charge up my Q to kill the Loli and Gay Cowboy infront of me so I get the triple kill. Its that odd sensation of doing something so impossible that lets me come back. As much as I would like to see more players play this game, knowing the steam community, I'd prefer not have an entire army of Max's up against me in a Team Elimination.\nThe only changes I'd make is probably fix the broken characters (Max, Wayne, Rose), and see what you can do with the Lag issue. If I'd add anything, I'd add Island and Prison from the Original GunZ map. On top of that, I'd like to see Colesseum changed so that it matches more closely to its original counterpart. (I want my old pitfalls of death back!) But if I were to reccomend this game to anyone, it'd be Koreans, people who played GunZ: The Duel, and people who play games like Guitar Hero, DDR, and other timing based skill games.","July 18, 2014","true","81.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This game has some of the worst controls and gameplay mechanics I have ever seen. They promise fast paced, high-mobility action. However, they deliver boring, clunky, hard-to-learn controls, and stun-locked gameplay. The weapons are extremely unbalanced, some weapons killing you in one hit, or taking you from full health to none in a matter of seconds. Swords, which are one of the basic, and suposedly more fun elements of the game are either useless, or overpowered. One hit from a sword stunlocks you into oblivion, where you might as well take your hands off the keyboard and wait for your inevitable death. Or, swords are useless, trying to run up on an enemy with any kind of machinegun is pointless, because you will be annihilated.\n\nThe controls are the worst part of this game. Double tap this, double tap that, but don't double tap spacebar while running up a while, you'll jump off. Oh, but to get on the wall, press spacebar after jumping towards it, which is activated by spacebar. To dash you have to double tap the movement keys, but the dashing is unlimited so there is no disadvantage to double tapping all the time.\n\nI may have only played a little bit of the game, about an hour, because I honestly couldn't stand it. The matchmaking is unbalanced, placing level one characters against level twenties. The community is toxic, constantly using offensive remarks: "fggt", "gay", etc.\n\nMy review may mean nothing, with such little time in the game, and that's fine. It's a free-to-play, so go ahead, try it for yourself.","September 27, 2014","false","0.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"

Even if you have a pretty low ping to host the enemies will teleport or appear alive after dying, etc.. During that time their animations appear jittery too. Temporary weapons from the game store which can also be repaired or upgraded to give you a huge advantage over those using default weapons, which can't be upgraded. I haven't seen it for myself, but I saw many hack complaints. Pay2Win is very real here as well. Multiplayer is a mess, and the co-op campaign is not good. Sniper(Ivan) is a significantly inferior class/character to get stuck with when people move around like monkies on crack in multiplayer.","March 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninengel/recommended/242720/","roninengel","Xion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roninengel/","147 products in account","I've been a fan of the Gunz series for quite some time, even with all the ups and downs the original Gunz had gone through. Really the only thing that drove me away from the first was the invasion of hackers, either wise I'd probably would've been playing it until this finally launched.\nLet me make something clear that this game definitely has taken another route than the original Gunz template laid out. Mainly the whole "style" attributes are gone but I do believe this helped open the game up to many more players as well as bring a lot more importance onto every aspect the game has to offer, instead of just a small segment. The customization, while not currently as diverse as I'd like, has the potential for a lot of growth. Currently there are 4 classes and most of them boast weapons unique to their class. The only similarity currently is Ivan (Silent Avenger) and Rena (Shadow Dancer) sharing the same automatic weapon type (an SMG). However they all have a firearm that is unique to them as well as a melee weapon that is unique to them as well that have quite the diverse abilities for them. Rena for instance wields two short sword nodachis (the game calls them daggers for some reason) and as a result she has the longest combo both on ground and air. She is also, I believe, the fastest character in the bunch; though all of them are pretty quick. While on the other hand you have Max, who wields a giant melee shield into battle. This shield may be a bit slow and boasting a low combo count, but it certainly hurts to get hit with. Not to mention he has the only block that completely protects against most firearms. His trade off is being one of the slowest classes and also having a pretty short reach with his firearms, though you can get some lucky shots with the minigun.\n\nBut I do like that each character is now unique. In the original Gunz, there were several classes to choose from but I never really noticed any difference between them besides what weapons they started off with (which could all be changed to whatever you wanted later on). Now I mentioned customization is a bit lax atm as all the classes are pretty much restricted to their own weaponry currently. I don't know if they plan to allow mixing up weapons later on or keeping them restricted to help make the classes stand out, we'll just have to see where it goes.\n\nNow the only major drawback to this game so far has been on the server side of things. Unfortunately it is quite a bit difficult getting into the game (with the low server capacity cap, currently only 4500). However another server side issue is the downside to peer to peer network. Unfortunately lag plays a huge factor when it comes to fast paced games and even with a strong connection, you can end up with a nasty lag situation all depending on who the host is. There aren't really any official servers people play on but more so user hosted matches. This ultimately can lead to many instances where some players can connect just fine but others have horrible connections or spike all over the place, simply because of the distance to the current host. Now the host can be changed via an option to help mitigate this issue, but unfortunately you're still at the mercy of whoever is in the room. While someone's own internet may be pretty good, that doesn't necessarily make them ideal hosts. Not to mention that the more people trying to connect to one game, the worse a lag situation can get. I discovered this issue playing Tenchu Z on the Xbox 360. The multiplayer lag in that game increases expotentially depending on how many participants are in the group (max 4 players). At 4 players, the game is essentially unplayable for anyone but the host. However when you remove that 4th person, at 3 players the game is a lot more stable. Likewise dropping it down to 2 people, depending on who is hosting, there may be little to no lag at all. But it never mattered who was hosting or how good their connection was, the second a 4th player was involved, the match would always lag horribly.\n\nNow the devs for Gunz 2 are working on increasing the server capacity and trying to improve their network to help make the experience much more stable for everyone but that stuff takes time. However, that is why the game is in an early-access stage (something many players tend to forget). There are many improvements to be made and stuff to add to the game to make it an amazing experience. However, Gunz 2 certainly can be an amazing title as long as it could pull its act together and remain strong, especially for a free-to-play title. Which by the way, they took a bit note from the original Gunz in how to handle the free-to-play market. There was a big divide between players who bought their gear in game and players who purchased better gear using actual currency, essentially creating a pay-to-win model. Though Gunz 2 handles this well by only having cosmetic things attached to the real currency, while every gear piece can be purchased with in game currency. Definitely an improvement and something that lets many new players come enjoy the game without feeling at a disadvantage because they don't want to make a real money investment to a game they may or may not spend a lot of time with. Now people who want to put a little cash into their characters can help make themselves stand out and feel unique, without gaining an unfair advantage over other players.","February 20, 2014","true","217.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is a game for you! GunZ 2 resembles a fast-action-packed shoot em up & ninja fighting genre all at once! And surprisingly all the character's are very balanced! Despite certain opinions of other players each character has a fair advantage or disadvantage about them and with 6 unique character's that has their own creative abilities it gives you a good set of game time to play them all and figure out what is your favourite! Most of my hours on this game was based on playing just one character so think of how long my hours would be if I played all six! Also to put it out there, with lots of different maps, weapons, costumes & even a type of case pack opening scenario all for free this game has left me very impressed! Despite having a few items that you can pay for with real money I don't find this a concern as they have a play more to earn more system with every item being available to buy with in game currency.\n\nMy only flaw with this game (unfortunately) is the following:\n\nLack of players on the server, making searching for games in ranked a pain.\nConnection issue: Despite having indiviual servers for EU & NA & SK we still have lag from players in NA or SK on a EU server which makes it unfair for all the EU players in the lobby as the NA or SK player always get host advantage.\nNo trading/timer weapons - I know i mentioned previous a case opening scenario but once you get the item it's either on a timer or untradeable to other steam accounts... (but the game is free so it makes sense)\n\nApart from that GunZ 2: The Second is most definitely a worthy game to give a try (LETS NOT FORGET THIS IS A FREE GAME)\n","April 8, 2015","true","10.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"
