I can't really call it a game since I don't think the point is to entertain you. It was originally a website and this is just the web-kit version of the site put on Steam. I'm not sure it will help anyone with depression, so much as it lets people with depression think, no you are not alone (the player, not the character 'You'). Other people feel the way you do.\n\nThe basic gameplay in Depression Quest is that you will read through things (You is the player character that you will play) and then make a choice of what to do (click a hyperlink).\n\nIt sets a story and gives you background information on things. You have everything going for you, a significant other, a circle of friends, a day job. Your girlfriend, Alex is supportive of who you are and understands you. That's more than some people have in real life, but it illustrates you can have everything and yet depression still affects you. At least the characters in the game are supportive of you and not questioning why you have depression or does depression exist or are you just lazy? Its almost like everyone accepts you, but you are the one with a problem that doesn't accept yourself. Its all inward in this experience. You make enough money to support yourself, so money isn't the issue, but money is never a discussion or a reason to the depression, its just all you.\n\nBelow each life choice, Depression Quest bluntly tells you that you are not in therapy, nor taking medication for depression, you are just dealing with it. The 'happy' or 'logical' choices are always crossed out forcing you to select the sad choices such as, 'watch TV, work on a project (Depression Quest) or crawl into bed.'\n\nThe big thing that I take away from this is everyone around you (the player character) really cares about you. It also seems like there's no way out. Maybe there would be a way out to happiness with diet, less beer, soaking up some sun so your body can make vitamin D or a life change, but that's never explored, you are just suffering from depression and forced to live that way. Depression Quest brings up minor what ifs, such as going back to school or finding a better job might help... but well there's risk. Those statements are never followed up. You have no choice to change things in your life (the character's).\n\nYou see the character get worse and worse with no help in sight. Almost as if the entire point of this is to make you the player depressed (which is different than depression). Crossing out logical happy choices for depressing ones. This is a quick experience that finishes after maybe 2 dozen pages of text. I quickly played through it three times and it felt like while there are multiple endings, it didn't feel like I wanted to take the time to see them all. Like reading and carefully selecting my choices leads to more reading to endings that I didn't feel were satisfying. It was too quick of an experience to feel nothing more than a brief diversion. Someone did write me on how to get to the 'good ending' where you are allowed to get help, but with so many choices and endings, I found it difficult to even get the good ending with someone telling me how to achieve it. Again, the happy ending just didn't feel good or satisfying. Maybe that's depression in a nutshell or maybe that's poor writing.\n\nTo anyone suffering from depression, there is always help. There are always people willing to help and you are never alone. *hug*","August 18, 2014","false","1.1"," 6,046 of 6,797 people (89%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","89","046","6","18","96"

It doesn't make the user understand depression at all. In fact, it's just the story of some overpriviledged guy too stuck in his head. Nothing awful actually happens to the character. The player isn't made to sympathize with him in any way. Instead it just comes off as "Make the right decision and get moderately better". Actual depression is nothing like that. It just fails on all levels to capture just how dreary and dreadful the world actually looks when you've got depression. There's no sense of hopelessness or despair.

Depression Quest takes the impossible  weight and drain of simply feeling /bad/, and reduces it to a rather whiney, irritating and self-absorbed narrative. It /then/ takes the raging emotional battles and incredible fears cloud rational thought and displays them as so many single-line responses. I KNOW WHAT TO DO. I KNOW A SEEING THERAPIST IS THE CORRECT CHOICE. I KNOW LYING BACK IN BED IS THE WRONG CHOICE. It's not about what you should do, it's about how in the heck to conquor all that negativity and emotional drag to get anywhere. It's about how to consciously break those cycles of self-hating thoughts and stop those feelings before they happen. Bear in mind these are only my objections to the depiction of depression as a disorder.\n\nDepression Quest as a game? I have literally read popup books that were more interactive, and I use the term correctly. The 1996 classic Wishbone and the Amazing Odyssey was 100 times the game this one could ever hope to be, and it had a neato dog. I tried to think of games that came close to being as frustrating to play, aside from personally offensive, and I counted to None! None games!

That's the easiest way I can describe it, but even that does no real justice. This game did the very thing that is almost impossible to do, offend me. It offends me, because of how terribly it misrepresents actual suicidal depression.

Keeping in mind that this is dubbed "an interactive fiction game" with almost no gameplay, I would like to think of this program as more of a webpage story. The writing in this program is at a level of articulation and description that I would expect from a middle school student. Personally, I was disapointed in the level of writing most of all, with this program being a text-based program.\n\nI'd like to make a note for anyone coming here thinking that suicide is a theme here. Chronic depression rarely results in suicide. On the other hand, major depression is typically what actually can result suicide.\n\nI find this program cringe-worthy and I am personally embarrassed to have this associated with depression. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoyed Gone Home, anyone without strong emotional intelligence, and anyone with depression looking for a good laugh with friends with depression.","August 16, 2014","false","0.2"," 1,353 of 1,624 people (83%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","83","353","1","7","6"

And while it tries to be an interesting interactive fiction game, it suffers from several misteps that ultimately made me feeling like DQ was poorly done and pointless to play.\nThe first thing was the music. I understand something upbeat and jazzy may not have been appropriate, but the same three or so bars of minor chord piano music just got annoying far too quickly. I would have liked an option to turn it off.\nAs for the gameplay, it's completely told through text with decisions at the bottom, like Choose Your Own Adventure books. The writer was of average quality. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't exactly Virginia Wolfe either. The choices frustrated me, however, by having you frequently unable to select more positive choices over more negative ones. I get that this was to simulate the 'it will never get better' feelings of depression, but there is a difference between feeling it will never improve and actively being unable to make a positive choice in your life, even ones like seeing a therapist. When I was depressed, they couldn't make me NOT see one.\nOn the bottom of your screen, you have boxes that discuss your condition in regards to depression, if you're in therapy, and whether you take medication or not. It seemed to me, though, that no matter how well the little box said you were doing, the story never reflected that through a brighter outcome (until the ending at least) or by letting you make more positive choices. I understand depression is a struggle, but I never felt any sort of real sense of progression beyond the game occasionally telling me I was with a token pat on the back.\nI also question whether this game belongs on Steam. I know it used to be a browser game, but it still looks and plays exactly like a browser game. Why does Steam have to be involved? In the end, I would not have played this game if it wasn't free.\n4/10","August 17, 2014","false","0.8"," 970 of 1,159 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","970","1","2","3"

It's just boring and is entirely all reading.\n\nDepression Quest is a very, very basic wall of text formatted into several linear paths about depression. Literally, wall of text after wall of text without any visuals other than grainy photographs at the top and a really depressing audio (similar to Minecraft's music). The story is written in a way that makes you feel like you're living a dead-end life without any motivation to go on. A bad event comes after bad event. Think of the game like a text-based version of The Walking Dead.\n\nDon't even bother trying this "game." If you really wanted to read up on depression, you can do so online with an easy Bing search. They even have a controls page. Don't know why anyone would ever use that, but they do.\n\nObligatory Score: Steam asks "Do you recommend this game?" Is this a game? Can I review it? Is this real life? N/A.

Each person deals with depression differently; when I feel it come on, I know to get out and do something to feel better. To have those options in the game scratched out makes the game seem biased to what most people think is depression; lazy, defeated, unhappy for months on end. Really, it was getting hard to play this game. There were problems in how depression was put out in this game. This isn't a game to play if you have experienced depression; this is sort of a mockery to ways of dealing with depression and posting this negative view of people with depression.\nLastly, I'd like to add that this isn't a quest. Depression isn't a quest that someone goes through. It's a real life problem that many people suffer with. This game makes it out that there is nothing you can do to make things better, which is even worse to read.\nI would not recommend this game.

To you I say: You are so much more important to others than you realize, and there is no shame in needing and getting help. In fact, it is quite heroic of you to be able to admit your weakness to others and to seek to better your situation.\n\nAnd to those who are depressed, this "game" will do absolutely nothing for you. Please go get professional help.\n\nTo those who are NOT depressed, you would be better of looking at your group of friends and looking for signs of depression yourself. Skip this "game" entirely. It is a waste of time.\n\nHere are (some) warning signs of Depression and/or Suicide.\n\n•Always talking or thinking about death\n•Clinical depression -- deep sadness, loss of interest, trouble sleeping and eating -- that gets worse\n•Having a "death wish," tempting fate by taking risks that could lead to death, such as driving fast or running red lights\n•Losing interest in things one used to care about\n•Making comments about being hopeless, helpless, or worthless\n•Putting affairs in order, tying up loose ends, changing a will\n•Saying things like "it would be better if I wasn't here" or "I want out"\n•Sudden, unexpected switch from being very sad to being very calm or appearing to be happy\n•Talking about suicide or killing one's self\n•Visiting or calling people to say goodbye\n\nIf you notice that somebody you know or love exhibits some, any, or all of these symptoms, make sure you say something to them. Offer them your support. Tell somebody else about it, whether it be your high school or college councellor, this person's parents, lover, doctor, etc. Encourage this person to seek professional help.

I've been suffering from depression since ten years old and I can't let some game make it look like you'e just "lazy." No ♥♥♥♥ you. You're not just "lazy." You're depressed. Depression is not as simple as an emotion. Depression is a location. That location is the end of the road, a gun to your head and screams. When your mother and father get divorced. When your mother beats you so badly child protective services has to get involved. When a ten year old child has to see his own brother accuse his non biological father after his original father killed himself. The man who raised him when he was a six. The one who did all this. And he accuses the ten year old boy's father of beating him when he was young. When it turns out the mother was cheating on the father. When you realize the garage door opening at five in the morning at night was the boy's mother going to the gym to cheat on the father. Depression is watching your whole entire world fall apart. This game just makes it look like you smoked a bit of weed and are lazy and sleepy. This game has nothing special other than depression. I don't believe anyone on that team had ever experienced depression. Because the real thing about depression is. There is no escape. It will follow you around and whenever you're having a happy moment you remember the bad moments, you always do. Even when I had no will to live, when I just wanted to end it all. I still soldiered on, I hated myself. I thought I was ♥♥♥♥, like everything was my fault. I soldiered on because people cared about me, people loved me. People talked to me. They taught me how to love myself, they taught me how to be myself again. Talking in this game doesn't help, it doesn't solve anything and it doesn't help your character which is a total and utter lie. So at the end of third grade the boy was depressed. By fifth grade the boy was happy. And by sixth grade the boy was loved. From one depression survivor from another, don't kill yourself. You might think nobody cares about you, but really all you had to do all along was open your eyes and experience the good. Therapists are overrated, talk to a dog and or cat.

I'm not the type of person who would intentionally make the character kill themself, but this is a story about depression. Many people with depression commit suicide. The fact that if I made certain choices, the character would kill themself would give me an incentive to play it so that they wouldn't kill themself. I feel like this would work better if it were a dating sim style game (I think they're called interactive novels), where you're the friend or family member of someone with depression, and you have to spend time with them to make them feel better, or they could kill themself.

This isn't a quality "game" (it isn't a game), and I was given no reason to give a ♥♥♥♥ about the character.\n\nUPDATE: I tried it again. Still found it terrible. And, yet again, I didn't finish it, but I got further this time. The fact that you are prevented from selecting certain choices is still infuriating. It was like a carrot on a stick. I don't have depression, but the fact that you can't even make an attempt to help yourself is absolutely frustrating. I had a few friends in school who did have depression, and they weren't like this at all. They were able to come to school, and have an enjoyable time with their friends, even if they were depressed. The main character just seems to shut down. Many people are still able to function with depression.\n\nSince the first time I reviewed this, I have played a few other visual novels, and found myself really enjoying the genre. This one still remains incredibly boring. The scenes weren't long enough, or descriptive enough to let me connect with any of the characters. The scenes were basically "X shows up and starts talking to you. They point out that you don't seem like your normal self. Here's some choices. The ones that will help you can't be selected, so you lie to them or brush it off. They make another point about you being strange, and the scene ends." This isn't good writing, it's lazy.\n\nSince the last time I played this, I learned who developer Zoe Quinn was. I greatly dislike this person, and her unprofessional attitude. Most of the positive reviews of this game I read were just someone joking about her reputation of sleeping with reviewers to get good reviews on this piece of garbage. That isn't a good sign.","August 17, 2014","false","0.3"," 215 of 262 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","215","262","2","0"

This is the kind of thing that I imagine as a flash game, somewhere on Kongregate or Armor Games where you don't have to keep it on your computer for the fact that it's just about clicking on links and expecting that you chose the right option.\n\nThe music I'd have to say is something I that I myself did not enjoy. The piano was slow, and as far as I could tell it was just a few second loop. The party music would have to be the same in regards to it just being a loop as well. Anyone who is seriously considering trying Depression Quest out, I recommend listening to something on youtube. "Under the Sea" from The Little Mermaid made playing this game a fun experience but if you don't like that song, "Hakuna Matata" from The Lion King is a good substitute.\n\nThe story itself is something that I personally could not get into. I think it was something to do with being depressed and having a girlfriend named Alex and yeah ... Couldn't get into it.\n\nThe fact that certain visable options aren't available in Depression Quest is quite annoying - but I guess that was what was intended when it was being developed. The choices when in your first reading were quite obvious to make, the train of thought that I had was "Choose the options that make the most sense. Don't focus on work? Hell no. Ignore girlfriend? Hell no. Go to party? Hell YEAH (the most exciting thing that happens until you find out that you're socially awkward even though you HAVE a girlfriend who tries to be intimate with you)"\n\nThinking that you clicked the wrong button and then backtracking to try a different selection of options probably made my experience a drool. Also the fact that choosing different options didn't really change the story all that much was also a bummer, for as short an experience as Depression Quest is, it does seem rushed, and if not rushed then not thought out a lot.\n\nAlthough this review in my opinion was not well thought out and was just me typing out things about Depression Quest that came into my head, I'd have to say that this isn't a fun or interesting experience. If you want to have fun with it, try listening to music that doesn't come from Depression Quest itself and don't get your hopes high when you see options that require you to be in any way social as they probably won't be selectable no matter what you try.\n\nNote: I avoided trying to call Depression Quest a game for a reason, the reason being because it doesn't take long at all to finish. Seriously though, not a long experience, I read it over a decent number of times just to see how fun I could make the experience with whatever I could find around me at the time.\n\nI recommend trying a 'Doctor Who Choose Your Destiny' book if you want to make choices in a story that directly impact how it plays out and haven't tried a interactive story before.","October 28, 2014","false","0.9"," 322 of 412 people (78%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","78","322","412","6","1"

Maybe it IS like this for some people in worst case scenarios, but still, even depressed people have a personality of some sort. Also, the music was very boring, slow, annoyingly repetitive, and just made me even less interested in playing more of the game. This also applies to the visuals. If I could, I'd rather continue to read it as a visual novel instead. Maybe it gets better the further you play, but until then, I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you have depression.

Anything positive, anything sensible anybody with half a brain would do and should do in these absurd situations are all blocked out to tease you, as if in an attempt to say "Because I have depression, I can not do this" -- which can not be further from the truth. The game attempts to showcase the mental disorder in an understandable standpoint, but fails terribly, instead taking it as some kind of given. It makes no attempt to show any glimmer of hope or actual realism in logical solutions, and instead wallows in its own idiotic sense of loathing.

Let me start out by saying that I have had depression. This "Game" is not accurate to what depression is like. I say "game" because it's not a game. You can't win nor lose. There is no challenge, it's an interactive story. The player has no reason to be depressed, and there is no conflict. There's no rising action, no climax, not even an actual ending. There is no structure. You're just told that you are depressed. The big problem is that the more depressed you get the more limited you are in your choises. My first play I got the worst ending possible for making choices I would realisticly make (or choises I was forced to make). Second play I chose all the good options and nothing really changed. All that happened was that I was less depressed. Nothing major to the story changed. It's less of a story and more of a series of events that sort of connect. The players depression is not realistic whatsoever. You just are depressed for no reason. The problem is that depression is a unique experience for everyone. The basics are the same but the way you deal with it is entirely up to what works for you. I personally shut myself out of the world and worked on writing short stories. I saw a therapist once and hated it. Hated the drugs too. This game makes it too black and white in solutions when really it's all grey. All the player can do to feel better is seek help from others. No way to feel good on your own. Depression for me was not wanting to do anything because it all seems dull. Here it's not wanting to do anything because you're scared. Depression is different for everyone, but here, it just looks silly. No reason is given for anything. It makes me feel diconnected from the story. The writing is really the biggest flaw. It just isn't what I would do. It isn't how I would act or how I feel with depression. It makes it boring and I just feel uninterested. There's just nothing here. You want to learn about depression?

I’m not sure if I was just dealing with grief or if I genuinely was depressed, but I played it hoping I could get an answer. My views are personal as a result.\n\nI found the options for what I could do to be more restricting as the game went on, unnecessarily so to the point where I found it harder to feel immersed in not even being able to try to do some of the things I’d like. Considering I did get medicine and psychiatric help after the devastating end to my long-distance 5 year relationship, I’d have like to know where I would have been for pursuing the same type of help in the game. Some choices in general, particularly the ones that didn’t allow me to talk about my problems, created a greater disconnect between my feelings and the protagonist. In particular, moments where I would simply “choose” not to allow my girlfriend Alex to understand my gnawing feelings that she may to be with someone else--uncannily like my own situation--were extraordinarily frustrating. The fact that the game was becoming linear at the moment I began to actually identify wit the protagonist made this feel like a lost opportunity to me.\n\nEither I’m too wrapped up in my own thoughts to truly empathize with the protagonist, or the developers failed to get a reliably feasible representation of what it means to feel depressed. If it’s the latter, it definitely comes in part from the emphasis on feeling doubtful for anything rather than the actual struggle it takes to pull-through with wanting to save yourself from yourself, which would have made the game give more agency to the player as well as accurately portray how depression is a behemoth of a challenge to feel you can overcome, not a parasite that forces you to make choices you don’t want to.\n\nWhile the atmosphere left me ready to cry some more, the game wasn’t immersive enough to make the experience feel well-executed. If the game had more focus on allowing choices that are difficult rather than simply disallowing the best options, I would feel completely in the place of this miserable protagonist. In short, the game has potential, but definitely needs refinement before it truly becomes what it sets itself out to be.","November 17, 2014","false","0.6"," 125 of 153 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","125","153","2","0"

Alas, I would not call this a successful attempt in raising awareness for depression.\n\nFor those who complained about not being able to commit suicide despite choosing the worst possible choices in this game, people with severe depression are in reality often too exhausted to do anything, including taking steps to end their lives (any form of suicide takes action, unless you count starving to death as an option).

Not a lot can be said for it in terms of originality, aside from the fact that nobody to my knowledge, has had the nerve to attempt to make depression into an interactive experience.\nI can't help but feel, as much as the supposed intentions of the author as stated at the beggining of the game are all fine and good, that this game comes from a somewhat self centered place. Many of those, and I include myself, who have suffered depression, can often tend to allow their experience to inspire their art and the results can be very satisfying. When I listen to, watch or observe such art, as much as it comes off as sad, it makes me feel joy. This is simply not the case with this game. The author has clearly taken their own experiences and their output has been to make a game that attempts to make other people feel depressed (and I'll place emphasis on the word 'attempt'), rather than to create art and other things that instead express and explore the feeling. It flimsily attempts to impose the feeling upon the viewer rather than present the feeling for the viewer to explore and gain something out of. This gives the game a very self indulgent tone. Self indulgence emanating from any piece of art is not necessarily a bad thing but in this case it feels as though it was completely unchecked by the author, and puts a very bad taste in my mouth.\nThere really isn't much to speak about in terms of art assets aside from it's sound track, which in my opinion sounds rather tacky and contrived, like the sound track to a depression ad campaign. I must actually say that I feel that the lack of art assets is one of this game's only wise decisions. It's white background and plain text don't overstate the feelings of depression the game is supposed to be imposing on you, which may even compensate for the horrible cheasy music I just mentioned. I can only imagine the overused contrasty pictures and grain effects that could have been chosen to give the game an 'edgy' and 'dark' appearance, and this makes me cringe.\nIf I could say one other good thing about the game, it would be in the effectiveness of the way in which it makes the player feel hopelessly as though their choices won't matter. Although as stated above, I can't say I appreciate this game's over all approach, and so this slightly impressive mechanic does not even begin to remove the bad taste from my mouth. It should also be mentioned that as a trade off this causes your play through to have little variation as your choices make little difference. No matter what, you tend to wind up back on the same path of the story no matter what choices you make. This only makes a story that is already dull, unoriginal and boring, even less worth while and gives it very little replayability.\n\nIn short, I feel that this is a misguided and self indulgent exercise running behind the pretence of being an attempt to reach out to people. It lacks both subtlety and substance, and as an experimental indie game it is dwarved by hundreds of text adventures, point and click adventures and experimental games that have come before it on the levels of creativity, originality, taste and righteous intent, and I can't say it deserves the greenlight it has received.\n","October 24, 2014","false","0.5"," 139 of 178 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","139","178","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerpetuallyTired/recommended/270170/","PerpetuallyTired","Akubi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PerpetuallyTired/","251 products in account","Depression Quest as described by their website is an “interactive fiction game where you play as someone living with depression. You are given a series of everyday life events and have to attempt to manage your illness, relationships, job, and possible treatment. This game aims to show other sufferers of depression that they are not alone in their feelings, and to illustrate to people who may not understand the illness the depths of what it can do to people.“\n\nLet’s talk about the code behind it… The game is written entirely in web-based languages, such as CSS, HTML, JS etc. It uses a node.js webkit browser to display said pages. There’s no problem with this, but it gave me a bit of a surprise as it doesn’t seem to be too suited to the task at hand. This also gave me a bit of trouble recording the game as I normally use DXTory but it didn’t pick the ‘browser game’ up. In my opinion it would be better coded in a different language as it didn’t even make use of any HTML5 features or any features to access websites which is kind of a waste.\n\nLet’s talk about the game itself, it starts out with some story that didn’t explain why the character was depressed at all, it just seemed to drop you into something you knew nothing about with unfamiliar characters. It asks you some questions on what you would like to do and you can answer, 1, 2, 3 or 4. Except 1 is crossed out for no apparent reason other than to provay the story and lock it down to a more linearised path.\nSuddenly after I clicked answer 1 to do work, I am very depressed for no reason other than to tell a story. Next my girlfriend calls me, Alex. It gives me a boring wall of text and 3 options. 1 is of course, as always crossed out because it is the most sensible option of them all - go hang out with your girlfriend and be happy, because that would be way too easy. Now we’re at a party, boring wall of text… and of course, option 1 is crossed off, which is the most sensible with ‘Enthusiastically socialize’. It really confuses me why the most sensible options are crossed off, I thought this story was Depression Quest and not ‘Let’s Try and be as Sad for No Reason and Silly as we can Quest.’\n\nNow we’re back home and our mother has come over for a surprise visit, except we can’t choose the most sensible option again, which is tell her how sad we are, I’ll choose the similar option, number 2.\n\nSidenote: For some reason the crossed out options and the one just below them are nearly identical… This game is strange…\n\nSo, I decide to take up this offer with this person to get a cat as the other options to take the cat but enthusiastically were crossed out..\n\nAnyway, the next scene is the character and their GF talking about some stuff I skipped because it was too long and didn’t seem too relevant to the plot when I speed-read it, anyway, you have options:\n1. Tell her how awesome she is, explained with lots of words.\n2. Tell her how awesome she is, explained with fewer amount of words.\n3. Ask if she is happy with the relationship.\n4. Do nothing.\n\nI have decided to chose 3 as it seemed the most sensible. You know I’ve found a pattern; the highest available one seems the most sensible one to choose but usually ends up making you more depressed for no apparent reason.\n\nAnyway, this carries on for some time. Eventually it just becomes “NEXT”, “PICK OPTION 6 AS IT’S THE ONLY ONE”.\n\nApparently playing with cats makes you depressed these days. I ended up after trying several times I managed to unlock the therapist and I talked to some guy called Attic who doesn’t actually live in my roof.\n\nI skipped forward because I was starting to get more and more bored by the planck time. Infact the boredom turned into depression it was that lackluster and dull (in a boring way). Anyway, its now Christmas and this is where the game ends.\n\nTL;DR\nBORING QUESTIONS, PRETTY LINEAR STORY WITH FEW ACTUAL CHOICES, AND A STORY THAT MADE NO SENSE.\n\nOverall: 1/10.

In my opinion is... Ok. I'll simply list what i like, and disliked.\n\nDislikes, starting off is the most glaring issue for me, the pretentiousness. The language, and tone just is so pretentious, there's a special way to write things seriously, and this game did not do it right, it just comes off as pretentious. (Sorry for saying pretentious so many times!)  Secondly, this isn't that bad for me atleast but i think the developers wouldn't appreciate this comment, it seems more like a... Pet game. I can't put myslef in the main character's shoes. (even though i have had suicidal deppresion.) It justs seemes like, im nudging around this sad little creature. Last, i really couldn't sypathise for the main character. the deppresion was very sappy, and cheesy, there really weren't any reasons for him/her to be depressed, he/she just was. and the existing reasons were terrible. the deppresion just seemed like a petty teenager overeacting to life.\nI also would have liked to be able to controll this person more. If this is susposed to be me, then i shouldn't be able to just make trivial nudges. Also, the "What do i do?" thing, was stupid. the options were so limited, and i got to choose so few things, the main character got to make important decisions without me even consenting!\n\nLIkes, I got a very good sense of... Satisfaction when i "beat" the game. I felt like i had helped my little pet make the right choices, and actually was touched by the ending, i found myslef smiling, becuase i had this felling that i had made my little pet happy. As i have had depresion the red corss over the best answer was good. if you're deppresed there are times when you want to, you know you should, but you jsut can't.\n\nAll in all, i wouldn't recommend playing. It shows a very melodramatic, unrealistic view on depresion.\n\n4/10 stars, a passable game.\n\nEdit: I also have learned the "reputation" of the person that made this game, and I honestly don't care.\nWhat I care about is that this is called an "Interactive Fiction" Yes It's FICTION, this is a FICTITIOUS story, at best it's realistic fiction.

Yes. Absolutely. This is right on point with what depression is like, even the noise on the status. You want to understand a friend or family member with depression, absolutely download this game. This is just plain clinical depression though. When you wanna mix in other types of depression or things like manic depressive or bipolar it is a whole new territory. Just use this as a baseline for regular clinical depression depression.\n\nDo I recommend this as a game? No. I like the sound track but there are very limited choices in which to live your depressed life and you don't get much insight on things. You don't even get a technical/medical aspect of depression. I'd like some customization, a more in-depth game. Turn it from a choose your own adventure to more like Kudos, where you can pick who you are, what you do, what kind of friends you have, and then fight depression by cutting out toxic people, going to a therapist, support group, seeing friends, petting cute animals, meds, or even just forcing yourself to get out there with both good and bad consequences. Perhaps even include different types of depresison or personality disorders. It could show you what its like in a wider scope and show you how to beat it. Now that's a game worth playing! Of course, this game is free and supported on donation. So perhaps that's unreasonable.

It’s kind of sad. This may help put me in the mood and let me understand what depression is for some.”\n\nI’ve dealt with depression in the past, and no, it’s not fun. It’s tiresome and… depressing (Lol, kind of like this review). But depression is a bit different from one person to another, so knowing how it was like for myself and some other people I’ve been close to, I was curious about how this game would portray it.\n\nFirst and foremost, the writing is decent. Fortunately for the player, there aren’t any serious flaws that derail the story completely. BUT, there definitely could’ve been more elaboration on the character’s past(s) or relationships with others. There was no real detail about the player’s workplace, or even their boss. Having that relationship explored more could’ve greatly helped the story, even if it was for a short moment.\n\nHalfway through the game, I just stopped caring about the outcome. Which is weird for me, since I’ve trudged through some pretty boring interactive fictions in the past, including those old school text adventures very few people would ever want to play (unless you’re into that sort of thing like me).\n\nTechnically, I found this game irritatingly lazy. There’s no save function. I know this seems trivial, but even with the most homebrew of interactive fictions through platforms like Gargoyle or the InfoCom reader, there’s usually a save function. If you find yourself bored wanting to quit to carry on later… YOU CAN’T. You have no other choice but to start from the beginning.\n\nThe “branching” story is misleading in the description above. This game is marketed as an interactive fiction with decent options to change the ending, but in reality, there isn’t. Most people aren’t going to play this more than once to realize this, but there is only one ending. Sure a couple words and things may be switched around or replaced, but it’s a lie. Sure your “stats” may be a little better or worse, but it doesn’t change the context of the game greatly enough to be considered truly interactive.\n\nAnd yes, I understand the crossed out options are options that would be available if you weren’t depressed, but since you’re given so little options, the variance is negligible. Therefore, replay value is at an all-time low. And even though I didn’t want to, I replayed this sucker more than I wanted to. I even went with the worst options available to me, singling me out to depressing options (no pun intended), to see if I would have a super terrible ending… it never came.\n\nFrom personal experience with depression, I faced myself at the edge of a bridge considering suicide since I’m a terrible swimmer. The choice of suicide never came in this game.\n\nI know this sounds absolutely terrible and I apologize to anybody that may be offended, but when you think the world is better off without you in it, you only drag the people around you down, that God has either forsaken you or isn’t even there, or if you killed yourself the world wouldn’t skip a beat, then yes… suicide, regardless of the stigma, is a viable option to somebody that is depressed, regardless of how terrible of a choice it may be.\n\nAn option for this could’ve been suicide, then showing the aftermath of what it would do to the family and friends of the player.\n\nUnfortunately if this choice was made into the game, you never get acquainted well enough with your family and girlfriend enough to actually care. They overall seemed paper thin in character, and sure this detail may be thrown aside as a viewpoint of somebody that's depressed. I get that. But if you want to really grind at the readers views and heart, you need to connect them to the characters and their feelings, including the supporting characters. This may seem pretty basic, but the supporting characters are just as important as the main. And no matter how crappy this sounds, suicide could’ve opened up another heartbreaker end game scenario in the fact that your new kitten would die of starvation because you killed yourself and nobody knew about it for, I dunno... let's throw out some arbitrary numbers: 4-5 days to a week at most.\n\nSo yes, I found this game lazy in mechanic and programming. From the lack of options, lack of ending, and lack of a save function. I felt like it always ended with a sigh with no resolution. Which is funny, since the writers at the end of the game thank you for playing stating, “there’s no real end to depression.” Which may be true, but I just found lazy. For a good story, there could still of been a resolution of what happened, even if it’s, “Oh, nothing happened. You stayed depressed and went into a deeper spiral of darkness. Lost your job, and found yourself homeless.” Or, “Your girlfriend Alex, wanting to help you, excorted you to go see a therapist.” Or, “Your family, admitted you to a psyche ward, because they realized your depression got so bad, you weren’t able to function in day to day tasks.” OR, “Your IM friend Attic, realized you didn’t go see the therapist, attempted to get you help in person. You denied. So he called a Suicide help line.” OR, “ANYTHING beyond the same thing, nearly every time.”\n\nThe music was okay at first… then it got annoying. And in the end it seemed to actually add to the boredom I found with this game. It definitely didn’t help the more times I played through it. Luckily there’s a mute function in the menu, or you can always just mute your computer audio.\n\nBUT here are the pros…\n\nI appreciate what the game attempts to do.\n\nThe pictures getting fuzzier and turning black and white was a nice touch.\n\nThe music getting a little distorted the more you get depressed was kind of a nice touch.\n\nI found no typos (unlike this review)\n\nFinal verdict:\nThis game should be Pong and Forgotten.\n3.7/10 – Not worth your time unless you’re really curious. OR, you’re a diehard interactive fiction novel gamer and want a taste of everything at some point, despite whether or not you’d like it or not. Which unfortunately for me, I fell under this category.\n\nP.S. I'll probably make a video review of this on my YouTube Channel. I know this is shameless advertising, but idc. It'll probably get me some views and subs because of the whole gamergate crap. Also, It'll knock off anybody thinking that I plagerized my own material since my Youtube name doesn't have the underscore. lol","May 11, 2015","false","1.9"," 76 of 94 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","76","94","5","0"

For me, I just didn't care, I didn't see a point to, why strive for anything? I often sat outside of the classroom in a ball because first off I couldn't see a ♥♥♥♥ing point in striving to do any of the work, and then furthermore the frustration that you can't do that and you know it's not normal or healthy drives you even further.\n\nIt's a continous spiral I feel, and I feel like the character was just in a slump. It doesn't represent my depression, but it might represent less severe cases, so I can't really say "NO THIS IS WRONG", but I feel that someone playing this game couldn't learn about how my own depression has affected my life, and I feel it chips away at the integrity of the game in that instance, because it's trying to represent an actual perseption.","September 27, 2014","false","7.2"," 111 of 148 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","111","148","0","1"

However, when I got into it, it wasn't fully what I was expecting.\n\nIt does have a decent amount of replayability, if you want to go back and make different choices, however, one questions if that is something that most people would even really want to do. Most of the choices seemed geared more towards keeping you in that depressive state, and all of the 'good' choices were unavailable to you. At the same time, only one side of depression was expressed, with a lot of things about the disorder being left out. This could have easily been fixed by lengthening the story and adding more to the characters in it. I felt like I wasn't really connected to the characters.\n\nIt did, however, do an excellent job expressing the fact that depression is something that can effect anyone, no matter what you have in life. This is the one really great thing that I hope people will take away from this game.\n\nThe music created a nice ambiance for whatever part you were at in the story as well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrafeena/recommended/270170/","terrafeena","Terra Feena","http://steamcommunity.com/id/terrafeena/","40 products in account","As somebody who struggled with depression for the better part of ten years, and seeing as this application is free, I decided to play it for myself. Yes, I know that this does not techincally qualify as a game, it's an interactive story, it doesn't belong on Steam, yadda yadda yadda. I agree, and I'm approaching this as the form of media that it is.\n\nFirst off, the presentation is quite bland. The sales pitch for this "game" promises that you can "watch the color get sucked out of how you see the world" as your depression gets ever deeper, however, there isn't much color in the game to begin with. It's a solid white background with plain black text in a generic font, with a small picture on top of the page, sometimes of something that has absolutely nothing to do with the scenario. I mean, come on guys...I understand that the point of this game isn't to entertain, but if you can't put forth the effort to make it look good, then why should we put forth the effort to stick around to the end? The pictures themselve are very boring and add nothing to the text. The worsening of your depression results in the picture becomming slightly swarmed with static, an interesting (albeit misguided) choice. Indeed, depression can make your life seem dull and dreary, but why would you choose static to convey this? All it did was make the picture look like a TV that's not getting good reception. The audio is also said to change, and it does, but not by much. It's the same ol' track, only tweaked a bit to make it sound a bit more unsettling (of course, I lowered the volume because it's just kind of annoying). Overall, the special effects did nothing to enhance the experience, and the presentation leaves much to be desired.\n\nSecondly, I don't understand the mechanics of this game. The story and outcome are driven by the choices that you make, but sometimes the outcome you get doesn't make much sense in regard to the choices that you made. For example, in my first playthrough, I based my decisions somewhat on what *I* would do in the given situation if I were depressed. I didn't always make good choices, and yet somehow, I got the good ending. On the flip side, when I chose the choices that I thought were the best options, I only got an okay ending, which confused me to no end. In the beginning of that playthrough, I made many choices in the beginning that were identical to my first playthrough. The only thing that was different was that I had chosen to try to get some work done in the first scenario, and my character somehow ended up even more depressed than when I had them veg out on the couch watching TV. And somehow, this ended up in me not being able to "test the waters" when I had lunch with Amanda. Even in Mass Effect, I could usually choose whatever option I wanted regardless of my past decisions. Of course, the first couple of options are always crossed out no matter what, as if their only function is merely to taunt you. These choices are the best ones possible, and you can never choose them, EVER. Although, sometimes when you pick the best choice available, it ends up backfiring, as is the case with the first scenario in the game. So really, what's the point? Another blunder is that the progress you make isn't really reflected that well between the text and the depression "meter". For example, if you have your character take medication, the text will say that they have noticed that they are feeling better, but the depression "meter" will persist on saying that your character is still pretty depressed, even after a few scenarios. The text itself is not much different depending on the depression "meter". There is a slight difference when you go the extremely negative path, but it's nothing to brag about. All in all, I didn't feel like the depression "meter" was a true-to-life representation. It makes it seem like when you are going through a major depressive episode, that you're down in the dumps everyday, and that's just not true. Some days are still better than others, and I just felt like this wasn't adequately reflected in the "meter". I feel like this feature shouldn't have been added at all, and I'm thinking the only reason it was added was for the sake of making this seem more like a game. And why was this game made compatible with the XBOX controller? It's just dumb. That's like surfing Wikipedia with a gamepad. Is this their way of saying, "See! This IS a game! It can be played with an XBOX controller!!!" Stupid...\n\nNow, let's deal with the actual CONTENT of the game. In which case, what more can I say that hasn't already been said? The writing is very dry and uninspired. It's like they were trying to write an imaginative story using nothing but exposition. There's absolutely no style, whatsoever. At the beginning, you're told that you are a "twenty-something human being" and that's about all the information you get on the character you are "controlling". There's not much backstory into your character at all, and you are spoonfed tidbits about your friends, family, and girlfriend by clicking on their names in the beginning, instead of, you know, fleshing them out in the story. You're also given some vague information about your job and a "project" that you work on off to the side, but you're never told what you do for a living other than that your job is dull and repetitive, and you're never told what this "project" is and why it's so important. Other than that, you're told absolutely nothing about your character, leaving you with the conclusion that he is the most boring human being that you've ever met. I'm thinking that they did this because they wanted players to put themselves in the main character's shoes, but it doesn't really work here, especially not when the story is so linear. Instead, leaving you to imagine what your main character does for a living, and the nature of this "project" comes off as a major cop-out to me. It takes away the work of having to create a character that people can connect with.\n\nSometimes the reactions of the main character are overly exaggerated. Like in the beginning, when he comes home from work and is for some reason overwhelmed with stress over the idea of working on his project. I didn't understand that at all. Why would you be so stressed out about something you do as a hobby??? It's not like this project is important to his job. It baffles me that the developers state the objective of this game is to get rid of the stigma of depression, but it seems they're trying to achieve this goal by resorting to stereotypes. The impression this scenario gives is that somebody who suffers from depression is so frozen by their anxiety that the very thought of even doing something that they love makes them want to curl up into a corner and suck their thumb. Of course, this is not accurate by any stretch of the imagination. It seems like this character is always over-reacting, even for a depressed person.\n\nSome elements of the story turn out to be a complete red herring, like the project, which is mentioned maybe two times in the entire story, and then forgetten completely by the end. Then there is the case of the resume you send for that "dream job", it's never mentioned whether you were contacted for that or not. I would imagine that being either called in for an interview or rejected outright would have a profound effect on the character, but it's never explored. This is yet another indication of lazy writing, or a complete lack of planning (or both).\nSome of the characteristics of depression were accurate, such as the feelings of isolation and the mental fog, but even the developers admit that not everybody's experience is the same. I think it would have been better if they had avoided a cookie-cutter story, and had mutliple characters with different personalities and life situations. Oh, but that would have taken actual WORK.\n\nCase in point, I can't recommend. It doesn't do well what it sets out to do.","October 8, 2014","false","2.1"," 56 of 70 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","56","70","0","0"

Although I applaud the intentions of the development team, the execution fails miserably.\n\nWhatever genre/style etc of game you play one of they key focuses is on creating an immersive environment. The first faux pax "Depression Quest" commits is to intentionally alienate the player through the constant use of the accusative pronoun "you". Being constantly reminded that you are a player and not the game's protagonist means it is increasingly difficult to actually empathise with Alex. This deliberate alienation between player and game actually detracts from the stated aim which is to "help people understand what it is like to be depressed". The over-use of the pronoun also makes the game appear to be controlling the action and outcomes, rather than the player. (Alright that's a highly subjective statement so I will clarify it further). When using accusative pronouns, we are telling others what we think about them or what to do. As the only interaction the player can engage in is choosing options, using the accusative makes the game appear as if it is telling us what to do, essentially coding a response, rather than the player having the illusion of control. This is particularly compounded by the fact that the choices are also phrased in the accusative... i.e. "You choose to stay at home and watch Netflix". Now the styling of "Choose your own adventure" does use the pronoun you, but usually only when asking the player a question. Questions are a direct, overt engagement that break the narrative (and consequently breaks immersion), this isn't necessarily the developers fault, it's a fault of the format, but when juxtaposed against the larger narrative it serves to further alienate the player from the story.\nThe sad thing is this could have been easily overcome by simply rewriting the game as a journal, blog or diary and so switching to the pronoun "I". (This is actually a viable option as many counsellors, social workers, psychologists and psychiatrists encourage the keeping of a diary or journal as part of therapy).\nThe writing is tediously unimaginative and dull, and simply fails to hold interest. There is little use of metaphor, simile or any sort of figurative or descriptive language. Now, this may have been a stylistic choice on the part of the writer, Patrick Lindsey, but it doesn't pay off. In other media we have been exposed to vigorous compelling accounts of people who have suffered from Depression, from Woolfe to Wurtzel with Plath inbetween. Lindsey has borrowed nothing from their style and in choosing to create a "factual" account has lost the lyricism that allows people to emotionally engage with a piece of writing (or game).\nLindsey isn't all bad though, his characterization is consistent and the narrative account is well researched. In fact I can recommend the portrayal of Depression at least. Three of the methods for coping and dealing with Depression are emphasised, the two most obvious are Therapy and Medication (primarily emphasised visually but also within the narrative itself), and the narrative additionally reveals the need for support systems, whether from a close loved one, family or friends. He also manages to note the relapse stages of depression through his characterization, however the game suffers from a lack of dialogue or choices within counselling/therapy. Even when you do opt for the counselling you aren't able to interact with the psychiatrist by giving or receiving information from her, information is only supplied through friend/family/girlfriend interactions. This means that, again the developers have managed to exclude a great deal of important information regarding coping techniques that would have enhanced the game by providing more interactions and improved their narrative discourse to meet their intention of informing people.\nVisually I presume they wanted to adopt a minimalist style, to better evoke depression. The colours are primarily shades of grey and the background is left a neutral white. The choice of font is similarly plain and clearly legible. In addition a variety of pictures are included to accompany the text, in an attempt to enhance visual appeal as well as serve a function of assisting in a display of how depressed Alex is. This is done by increasing the amount of "noise" overlying each picture and the text at the very bottom of the screen when he begins to suffer greater depression and decreases as he returns to an equilibrium state. It's a clever idea and it works fairly well, at least in the case of the pictures. On the text at the bottom of the screen however, it merely serves to distract from readings of the text by annoyingly catching attention in some sort of entoptic diversion. The pictures themselves are at least evocative, and add some much needed emotional colour to what is otherwise a rather drab piece. Now again, Depressed people do suffer from dampened emotions so the choice may have been a stylistic one on the part of the developers, but if you are making a game for non-depressed people to engage with you need to convey lethargy and despondency through your medium which Depression Quest would appear to, intentionally, refuse to do and so fail.\nThe music is suitably doleful, and repetitive, which does assist the atmosphere when reading the story. In fact my response is slightly different to most in that I don't find it annoying, its chords become familiar and in a way reassuring, blurring off into background noise, and not overtly intruding, allowing one to focus on the text. I didn't however notice any substantial change in the music depending on your depression level, in fact it doesn't even tranpose to a "happier" key, so I was slightly disappointed there.\n\nIn conclusion, I applaud the intentions of the game to attempt to recreate what depression is like, however it alienates the player, is riddled with poor design decisions, and utterly fails to capture attention or interest despite being well researched.\nInstead of playing this go read Viktor Frankl's "Man's Search for Meaning" instead.","October 24, 2014","false","1.0"," 77 of 104 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","77","104","0","6"

The guy in the story seems to have his ♥♥♥♥ sorted out. Girlfriend, job, house, family and so on. The way you progress through the game is just to keep on picking certain options until you finish.\n\nI always picked the options that were right, going to see a therapist, tablets and so on. This is not how it works. The ending I got seems to think that he just brushes it off as if it was nothing. Depressed people can not just say, "Well, tablets are good. I'm fine now." I don't think the creator of this game really knew what depression really is because it's nothing like the game.\n\nA nit-picky thing is the title. Depression Quest is a stupid name. It sounds like you're on a quest for depression.\n\nHowever, where the game flops in it's main purpose. It flourshies, sort of, in it's writing. It's very detailed and the multiple choice answers are there and will make you think. Do I want to go to a party even if I don't want to go? Or do I stay in and play with my cat?\n\nBut these all seems pointless when the main part of the game, the depression, is so quickly glanced over and easily dealt with.

So, like almost everybody else, I've heard about this thanks to all the controversy surrounding Zoe Quinn and I went into it quite negatively biased. Anyway, I wanted to see what all this fuss was about and I'll try to sum up my thoughts as objectively as I can in this post.\n\n\nSo, with all that out of the way, is Depression Quest a good game? First of all, it's not much of a game. It's done in the classic choose-your-own-adventure style, but it's not done very well. Your choices don't affect the main course of the game very much - they mostly just affect your character's status.\n\nGenerally you just get a wall of text and a few options (which options you get depends on your character's status) and you choose one of them. This may cause a change in your character's status, e.g. it can make you more or less depressed. Then you get another wall of text which is a reaction to you choice and then you move on to the next event.\n\nAnd that's it. Most of the game follows exactly this formula and you shouldn't expect any extensive branching - there isn't any. The only change is right at the very end, and that's simply not enough.\n\nThe other problem is that it's quite easy to get a good ending - just pick the choices that make your character actually DO something. And of course it's equally easy to get a bad ending - just pick the choices that make your character do nothing. Usually the choices are even ordered from good to bad, so you really don't need to think about them too much.\n\nUnfortunately all the above means that there is not much replay value. You may go through the game two or three times just to be able to read the different endings, but you really will not be reading all the stuff before that.\n\n\nTechnically the game is alright. Although for some weird reason it has to run in three processes which in total use more than a hundred megs of RAM. I guess it's got something to do with the fact that the game is using Webkit. There's a graphical glitch when the text is shorter than what fits on your screen, but that doesn't cause any problems.\n\n\nThere are a few typographical mistakes, but nothing serious (there will probably be more mistakes in this post than there are in the game :P). I haven't noticed any bad grammar or misspellings.\n\n\nWhat is kind of annoying is the sound. Basically, it's just a single repeating piano track which gets boring quite fast. There are some ambient noises for some of the events but nothing major.\n\n\nAnd finally we get to the last part. This game obviously deals with depression, which is quite a strong emotional theme. So, did I feel depressed when playing this? Not exactly, although it did show me how a person with depression might feel - or at least I think so.\n\n\nAll in all it's not a great game. The mechanics are weak and the depression part just doesn't do it for me, but that is most likely subjective.\n\nFinally, I do feel that it doesn't deserve all the publicity it's getting, but hey, at least it's free.\n\n\ntl;dr: I felt more depressed when I couldn't find the bloody keys in Doom.\n\n\n","August 19, 2014","false","1.1"," 36 of 40 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","36","40","0","0"

It does involve choices and a story and somewhat of a level of immersion, now as a game it doesn't really deliver any sort of exposition to the player, it just sort of expects you to pick up on it, which kind of confused me near the beginning, I had questions about who my character was? if it was supposed to be me or someone I'm playing? I also was slightly confused with the cast of characters because of the gender neutral names and the lack of any true back story. So as a game this has a few flaws but the story is not one that's bad, the way its told is not bad, the difficulty is extremely easy but, I don't really see the game as something that is about winning, it seems to be more about experiencing depression through the eyes of this character. I honestly believe this game shouldn't have as much flak as it's getting, I will probably start a discussion to further my opinions on this game because its so.... currently noted.\n\n\nSo now the standard game rating:Story: 7/10 (Its a story and its not really explained well, there are some branching sort of choices but all together its very short but well written.)\nGameplay: X/10 (Text adventure things don't really count for gameplay, all of them have choices and reading, you don't add anything to that normally.

It's hardly even a "text based adventure". It consists of reading walls of average-at-best text and choosing from a few different options. Depending on previous choices, you can get to a point where there isn't any choice at all- every option but one is crossed out. I guess the developers were trying to represent the lack of motivation that can come with depression, but when your attempt to simulate depression results in 20 minutes of clicking through boring pages of text, you've done something wrong.\n\nAfter playing through this "game", I just found myself angry and offended. It claims to try to help people without depression understand what people with it go through, but all it really accomplishes is making people with depression look lazy, completely unmotivated and utterly incapable of making any good decisions to improve their situation. I have depression. It does make you feel like crap, it can destroy your motivation. What it doesn't do is prevent you from trying to get help. When one of the characters gave the protagonist the phone number for a therapist and my only option was to crumple up the note and throw it away, I just sat in silence.\n\nThat's the main problem with this garbage (aside from the fact that it's a boring piece of junk)- it portrays what I can only assume is one of the developers' experience with depression as what all sufferers go through.

Every case is different, and frankly, I find this game insulting to anyone who does suffer from depression.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/reikkei/recommended/270170/","reikkei","Rei","http://steamcommunity.com/id/reikkei/","47 products in account","Depression Quest is an interactive narrative with a set goal: to try to help people who haven’t experienced depression understand what it’s like for the sufferer. However, throughout my time with the narrative, I couldn’t focus as much on the goal of the story because of the poor implementation of the game design itself.\n\nYou play as an unnamed character who struggles with depression that progressively gets more burdensome as the game goes on. The goal of using an unnamed character was probably to put the player in the character’s shoes, but for me, it only served to give me no real connection to the character. In the first few pages of the game, when the character is introduced, there are various links to other pages that explain some of the context for future situations. One, for example, is described as “a project you’ve been working on,” but since it doesn’t go into detail, the player loses a connection with the character that could’ve been more personal. At the end of a long section of pages, when the character needs to make a decision, there are a few different options, with the first always crossed out—the next few will continually be crossed out as the depression worsens. This option is clearly supposed to show what the character could do, if not for the depression, but instead it just distracts from the actual possible choices and the player finally picks something to just get past the page.\nThe music and overall design of each page also leaves the player feeling bored and uninterested.\n\nThe supposedly “sad” piano music is distracting from the text, and the page itself, being a static, gray affair, doesn’t do much—if anything—to hold the player’s attention and keep them focused on the story. The status buttons below decision options are also static, with a poor font choice, and slightly distract the player from the options available. Another problem is that you cannot stop playing and pick back up where you left off. For a game with such a bland, boring interface, not having this option makes the player even less likely to want to work back through the game, if they have to stop playing for some reason.\n\nOverall, this game could have been much better, if it had been designed to better keep and hold the player’s attention. As it is, there are too many distracting things going on and not enough draw to the story to keep the player interested and caring about the outcome.","November 17, 2014","false","1.0"," 60 of 83 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","60","83","0","1"

It finds its way home and crawls back, even with proper medication/therapy/love/whatever. It’s not that simple, some people might be “cured”, but it’s definitely not the same for everyone else. It’s a constant thing in a person’s life, it appears when you less expect), I felt that this game was not real. First, I felt that the MC was suffering from the effects of depression beginning to grow. But having choices literally locked because apparently “you can’t do that” made me angry. People can TRY to do those things even tho they are depressed! Locking the options was a terrible thing in my opinion, leading the MC to an endless spiral of unworthy feelings, when I actually wanted to help them. This kills the concept of the game, which was supposed to be interactive and you could attempt to make the MC get help.\n\nCharacter development wasn’t good either. MC was too plain, I couldn’t feel any sympathy for them, same for the other characters. This could have been a decent/good game (I honestly believe that), but it’s not.\n\nPlease don’t treat this subject like a superficial aspect.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/recommended/270170/","serendone","Serendone","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serendone/","675 products in account","The War of 1812 was a military conflict, lasting for two-and-a-half years, fought by the United States of America against the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, its North American colonies, and its American Indian allies. Seen by the United States and Canada as a war in its own right, it is frequently seen in Europe as a theatre of the Napoleonic Wars, as it was caused by issues related to that war (especially the Continental System). The war resolved many issues which remained from the American Revolutionary War but involved no boundary changes. The United States declared war on June 18, 1812 for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by the British war with France, the impressment of American merchant sailors into the Royal Navy, British support of Indian tribes against American expansion, outrage over insults to national honor after humiliations on the high seas, and possible American interest in annexing British territory in modern-day Canada.[3]\n\nThe war was fought in three principal theatres. Firstly, at sea, warships and privateers of each side attacked the other's merchant ships, while the British blockaded the Atlantic coast of the United States and mounted large raids in the later stages of the war. Secondly, land and naval battles were fought on the American–Canadian frontier, which ran along the Great Lakes, the Saint Lawrence River and the northern end of Lake Champlain. Thirdly, the American South and Gulf Coast also saw big land battles, in which the American forces defeated Britain's Indian allies and a British invasion force at New Orleans. At the end of the war both sides signed the Treaty of Ghent and both parties returned occupied land to its pre-war owner and resumed friendly trade relations.\n\nWith the majority of its land and naval forces tied down in Europe fighting the Napoleonic Wars, the British used a defensive strategy in the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada, repelling initial American invasions. Early victories over poorly led American armies such as the Battle of Queenston Heights, demonstrated that the conquest of the Canadas would prove more difficult than anticipated. Despite this, the Americans were able to inflict serious defeats on Britain's native American allies, ending the prospect of an Indian confederacy and an independent Indian state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. US forces were also able to make several gains on the Canadian frontier; taking control of Lake Erie in 1813 and seizing western parts of Upper Canada. However a large-scale American attempt to capture Montreal was repulsed in November 1813, and serious American attempts to conquer Upper Canada were ultimately abandoned following the bloody Battle of Lundy's Lane in July 1814.\n\nIn April 1814, with the defeat of Napoleon, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending larger invasion armies and tightening their naval blockade. However, with the end of the Napoleonic Wars in Europe, both governments were eager for a return to normality and peace negotiations began in Ghent in August 1814. In September 1814, the British invaded and occupied eastern Maine. In the south-west, General Andrew Jackson destroyed the military strength of the Creek nation at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend. The British victory at the Battle of Bladensburg in August 1814 allowed them to capture and burn Washington, D.C, but they were repulsed in an attempt to take Baltimore. American victories in September 1814 at the Battle of Plattsburgh repulsed the British invasions of New York, which along with pressure from merchants on the British government prompted British diplomats to drop their demands at Ghent for an independent native buffer state and territorial claims that London previously sought. Both sides agreed to a peace that restored the situation before the war began. However, it took six weeks for ships to cross the Atlantic so news of the peace treaty did not arrive before the British suffered a major defeat at New Orleans in January 1815.[4]\n\nIn the United States, late victories over invading British armies at the battles of Plattsburg, Baltimore (inspiring their national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner") and New Orleans produced a sense of euphoria over a "second war of independence" against Britain.[5][6] The Federalist Party had strongly opposed the war effort and prevented New England from providing much in the way of soldiers and troops; it now virtually collapsed. The war ended on a high note for Americans, bringing an "Era of Good Feelings" in which partisan animosity nearly vanished in the face of strengthened U.S. nationalism. Spain played a small role, but was not an official belligerent; some Spanish forces fought alongside the British during the Occupation of Pensacola. The U.S. took permanent ownership of Spain's Mobile District.\n\nIn Upper and Lower Canada, British and Provincial militia victories over invading American armies became iconic and promoted the development of a distinct Canadian identity, which included strong loyalty to Britain. Today, particularly in Ontario, memory of the war retains its significance, because the defeat of the invasions ensured that the Canadas would remain part of the British Empire, rather than be annexed by the United States. In Canada, numerous ceremonies took place in 2012 to commemorate the war, offer historical lessons and celebrate 200 years of peace across the border.[7] The war is scarcely remembered in Britain, being heavily overshadowed by the much larger Napoleonic Wars occurring in Europe.\n\nIt was ok.","June 16, 2015","false","0.7"," 90 of 140 people (64%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","64","90","140","63","1"

Yes, at the end of the story it says some fluff about this being a lifelong struggle, but the story never delvs into anything more than superficially.

Whatever, the actualy gameplay is bland but it is text based, what would you expect?\n\nMy core issue here lies in the representation of depression and the way the "adventure" is set up.  So it starts you as a depressed person with not much context as to how you got there.  Then, it throws you in with a cast of characters who seem  to want to help you but no matter what I did my character was constantly in a downward spiral.  It seemed like the creator was under the impression that a depressed person can only be helped by therapy and SSRI's (anti-depressants).  This game perpuates the idea (which is wrong) that all depression can be fixed with drugs and that all depression is basically the same.  This is anything but though truth, there are thousands of factors that can influence depression.  Diet, excersize, lack of vitamin D, getting a blood test to test for lack of SERT (serotonin transporters), or drug abuse.  You do not have the option to explore any of these.  No, you are on a downward spiral and you can't get help to get better.  It is a terrible representation of depression because depression is something that simply can't be represented in a video game.\n\nThere are reasons that doctors spent years and years studying depression and mental illnesses because there are millions of factors and millions of solution and possiblities.  This game is not just an embarrassment to video games but to people who are unlucky enough to suffer from depression and or anxiety.  How this game got past greenlight simply blows my mind.  I can not recommend this game at all, to anyone.\n\nIf you are suffering from depression, know this, there is help and there are people out there who care about you.  I was lucky enough to have my parents and they are the the primary reason I graduated highschool and made my way into college.  Please to remember,  It gets better, I promise.","August 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","24","28","0","0"

I tried to play this "game" out as I would in real life, I've seen profecionals and even tried medication, however in the end this "game" told me that I should be on the mend. I can attest I am not. I think it might have made me focus on my problems even more, because it's telling me things should get better. If you're going to make a text based "choose your own ending" type game you must give the player the option of choosing their own adventure. Locking off answers and simply saying "You'll never NOT be depressed" is frankly the antithisis of gaming.

The biggest problem this game has is completely preventing you from doing the 'best' choices.\nDepression is not like that.\nIf you are depressed, doing the 'best' thing is hard, but not impossible.\nIf the options were running, the 'best' option would be running twice as far as any other option.\nHarder, requiring more effort, not impossible. They do, however, often feel impossible.\nThis game tries to represent depression, and to does so poorly. This game shows what a person who has never had depression, but has done some background research on it, would think depression is like. The reviews left on the main site feel forced, because the reviewers may have feared being accused of misogyny, and do not accurately reflect the actual game. But I digress.\n\nThis game portrays depression as nearly a hopeless spiral of constant self loathing and negativity.

So I decided to have a go, maybe only because the counter-arguements were developed in such a juvenile attitude.\n\nFirst of all, as a person who suffered depression couple of times in his life, this game fails to describe the emotions and perception of every day life of a depressed person. It repetitively tells that you are exhausted, tired, nothing to keep you going but when it comes to the actual feelings that depression creates, it is possible to say narration and description in the game is quite bland and dull. If you want to know how depression actually feels, you can always listen to People Are Strange from The Doors.\n\nAlso I don't think that this game should be on Steam. As an educative tool on internet, it might help some people but here, it probably won't. If you want to tell a story about a depressed person, do it in the way Telltale Games does, if you want to explore the depths of a human mind, do it in the way Psychonauts does, do you want to express the perception of every day life in depression, get some ideas from Quantic Dreams (or even Max Payne) this is not the way how you can accomplish these with a "game" on Steam. Considering they are in the same genre, the Commodore64 game Alter-Ego is still so much better than this so called game.\n\nAs I said above, be helpful to people, it's a good cause. Seriously. But please don't call this a game. The right definition you're looking for is "interactive educative tool."\n\nP.S.: Most of the people writing reviews on this game here have the intellect of a pile of manure.

I felt like I was wheeling a wooden plank through a series of rooms, so lacking in personality or any distinguishable features that I found myself bored, and struggling to read the text that was telling me how I was 'feeling'. It worries me that the person this game is portraying is dull, boring, robotic. While some ambiguity and vagueness is needed in order for any player to put themselves in the character's shoes, I felt like that vagueness was taken to a point where we can no longer truly care for the character.\n\nI was also troubled by the lack of options. As someone who has experienced depression, I know that there are times where it feels like options are limited. But people don't express depression in the same way. I have been the person that, despite feeling like death inside, I went out, feigned happiness. I went out and did things, even if I wasn't being honest with people, and that was part of my problem. That was something I had to deal with for years, giving the appearance I was happy and healthy, when I wasn't. I was disappointed to find that so many of the options I'd have chosen, the options that would make sense to not just me, but probably many other people just trying to survive, and maintain the life one has, were just simply crossed out, as if the mere thought of doing such a thing was preposterous.\n\nI couldn't help but feel just a bit insulted by that. That my experience was an impossibility.\n\nSo no, I would not recommend this game.

I was too disinterested and disconnected with the character to care about pushing through.\nI do think the theme is important, but I do not feel like this game is a strong example for how games can capture an experience. I would like to see the theme handled with greater mastery of the medium and narrative.","November 4, 2015","false","0.4"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","20","23","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/270170/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","Depression Quest has stirred up quite the controversy and has already received many negative reviews as well as a lot of troll reviews that are to be honest hilarilously funny. I was really tempted to write a troll review myself but I'll try to give a honest review here. Im aware that it is highly debatable if Depression Quest qualifies as a game or not but I will at times refer to it as "the game" and to the act of using it as "playing". I don't want to scratch the topic if it's a game or not but I'll use those words for convenience.\n\nIn Depression Quest you play as a person with depression trying to manage daily life. The game is fairly minimalistic and basically looks like a website with white background and some gifs. It can be controlled with the mouse or suprisingly with a gamepad. Depression Quest plays like a "choose your own adventure"-book. You basically read a short story and sometimes get to choose from a set of options to determine how the story continues. The problem is that despite the advertising there is not much to choose from here. Some people complain that many of the options are crossed out and not selectable. However, I think that is actually getting the point of knowing what the right thing to do is while being unable to do it across. Depression Quest portrays depression and it does not do a particularly bad job at it but it is all that it does. It does not offer any way out, what is depressing in itself. If that was the point of it then it works out well but I think that there should be more to it. As it stands Depression Quest does work as an art project but has severe shortcomings in the game department. The writing is not great but is does its job. It just feels too clichéd at times. During the first minute it almost put me off immediately though because it comes with a trigger warning. Also it describes the protagonist as a "human being" instead of specifying the gender or just using ''you''. The problem is that the developer apparently forgot about that part immediately. For the rest of the game it is clear that the player character is in fact male. I really wonder what the original point was then.\n\nI would not recommend Depression Quest to anybody who is actually suffering from depression or anybody not interested in the topic. If you want to get a basic understanding of the way people with depression think it's worth a look though. However, I say that only because it is free. If it would cost actual money I would advise you to stay away from it.\n\nDepression Quest is not completely horrible but below average and has next to no target audience. To a certain degree it does what it was set out to do. What it does is however not for everyone, even among the expected target audience. Some people with living depression may share similar experiences to those depicted in the game, others won't at all. If you want to play a simplistic game that explores the human condition you are better off with Papers, Please since that game does not simply describe a situation but presents you with a moral dilemma and communicates its message through actual gameplay. As for Depression Quest... it takes no advantage of the medium at all.\n\nMore reviews here","August 22, 2014","false","0.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","22","27","0","0"

I deliberately ignored the warning to see what this "game" had to offer. Long story short, I had a really bad breakdown and then I decided to go to therapy. So there was some benefit to me playing this.\n\nIf you have depression, this is nowhere near accurate because, even at my suicidal worst, I was still able to make myself do things. The best ending in the scenario presented isn't necessarily the right one in real life. Medication doesn't work for everybody, there are therapists who are motivated solely by money and, in my case, people aren't always understanding of what you're going through. However, like others have said, you're not alone in the end.\n\nIf you don't have depression, the same inaccuracy applies, but I will say that it can offer some insight into what depression is. There are still a lot of people who think it's a choice/lifestyle. I think DQ busted that myth just fine, but it's not always evident when someone is depressed and there is a spectrum of kinds of depression. There isn't always consistency with depression. Believe it or not, we have good days too.\n\nIn the end, Depression Quest was a bit of an eye-opener for me personally. YMMV, but don't expect all the answers to be here.\n\n","January 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","27","36","0","0"

Each page, if you wanna call it that, is literally a long story. I'd have no problem with this if this were a book or some other medium, but there really is no gameplay, something that could potentially really connect you with the feeling the game is trying to show.\n\n2) The game seems to show a rather extreme side of depression where everything is doom and gloom. I won't contest this as being a real life possibility, but it would seem that a greater impact could be given if there was a build up, a slow, gripping build up that led to the intial level of depression seen in the game. Then maybe it could show how bad and dangerous depression can really get if left untreated.\n\n3) The person behind this game, Zoe Quinn, is a total hack in the industry. Based on evidence compiled around the internet by actual legitimate sources, she has done nothing but produce sympathy toward herself through falsehoods and fake outrage. Tack on to this the fact that she somehow has several journalists and indie developers in her pocket, presumably because of the fact she has dated them and then used this to her advantage by getting positive coverage of her out and then destroying any negative coverage, be it legitimate or not, just goes to show how corrupt ♥♥♥♥ can get.\n\nI do not recommend this game. If it were remade with some better design choices, it may be a great way to show the effects of depression to others and help people who have depression. But with its current state, and the fact that it really only exists to further Zoe Quinn's agenda, it is a sure pass.","August 19, 2014","false","0.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","0"

It's no different than the free browser based game originally made and the only gameplay you get is responding to questions. This is not to be used to try to sympathize to someone with Depression, nor is it a tool in understanding depression. This is a ♥♥♥♥ text game that trys to convey a ♥♥♥♥ generic plot and fails at doing so.\n\nEveryone going into this obviously wants to have the best outcome. The only negatives you get is if you just choose all the most negative responses regardless, it locks the most obvious postive choices from being picked. Even if you are depressed, and even if you are SEVERLY depressed, you can still CHOOSE to do things that will bring you up, even if for a moment. I know I sure as ♥♥♥♥ have done so.\n\nNow with that out of the way, theres nothing stopping you from picking everything "right" from the git-go. Therefore, it's not realistic in its message at all because you seemingly "fight" your depression extremely easily in what seems like a 4 min game.\n\nThere's not substance. Your supposed to "care" about your outcome, but nothing happens because of no visulization. The characters are cringe-worthy, and the story is absolutely ♥♥♥♥ing generic.\nThis game paints people with depression as unlikeable ♥♥♥♥s that are completely useless. I'd like to quote from another reviewer on here, Judge Holden.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n"This game goes out of its way to display depressed people as utterly unlikeable people, unable to think for themselves and dependent on the most superficial of things to be able to carry on with their normal lives. People currently struggling with anhedonia or depression will most likely see themselves meta-scrutinizing their own lives from a new perspective because of this game, should they not know any better. People who have never struggled with depression could easily learn to see depressed people as useless, oversensitive lumps -- exactly the way that this portrays it.\n\nIf there were like at least either still shots of things happening, maybe I'd care more, but I wouldn't even care if the first option I was presented with was to kill myself. I'd off the character and turn the game off right then and there."\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThere's absolutely nothing outside of this mediocre story besides the feeling of boredomness you get.\n\nAlso, about Zoe Quinn:\n\nZoe Quinn is an insane ♥♥♥♥nut that believes being trolled by people = getting ptsd. She's like the brain dead Anita Sarkeesian, except she lied about the ♥♥♥♥ in the first place, calling the supposed website that bullied her "lame man-children". and "virgin pedophiles".\nproof she lied http://imgur.com/a/4VOcx\n\nPeople like her want to censore the internet because some things people say hurt her feelings. I hate to tell you, but Steam's has already enforced a form of censoreship in censoring words. I wish neo-feminazis would get it through their skulls that not everyone in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed world agrees with their absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t ideolgy of placing themselves higher than other people.\nShe censored people from criticizing her game, and then talks about how censorship is unjust. She is a hypocrite, and among everything, a lying sack of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTHE ONLY REASON this game got on Steam, is because she slept with not 1, not 2, but 5 DIFFERENT ♥♥♥♥ING GAMING JOURNALISTS. Everyone on the greenlight community expressed their displeasure with this ♥♥♥♥ and it STILL got on Steam.\n\nDon't waste your time installing this waste of space. Steam is literally becoming shovelware central, and it's sad that things like this are even considered "games" now a days.","August 29, 2014","false","0.1"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","23","29","0","3"

I hope to be a little more constructive...\n\nI was quite looking forward to Depression Quest as I'm no stranger to depression, I've felt different kinds in the past and I'm currently going through a rough patch at the moment. I was also a big fan of Dear Esther, another game that centered around depression, loss and grief and I loved To the Moon for its similar themes.\n\nI was equally as disappointed as most to see that the game was about advanced as a basic website, a white background, with text and a depressing piano rift but, obviously, I tried to see past that and tried to judge the game on its story and the things that it DOES offer.\n\nWhat it offers is a scenario, in which it tells you, your problem and then gives you a list of options, asking you how you would proceed. I usually like this style of storytelling, like in Tell Tale's games or your average RPG and went along with it but I was a bit puzzled to see that two of the options were crossed out and one of them was the option that I would have picked. It didn't take me long to see through the message, that this game appeared to be conveying.\n\nThe logical answer is always crossed off the list, meaning that people suffering from depression aren't capable of ever doing the logical thing. Though this may be true for some cases, it's not true for EVERYONE and it's certainly isn't a rock hard fact. The reason that it, especially, bothers me is the fact that the only thing you do is read a wall of text before making a decision and after a few minutes, the decision aspect is completely taken away from you, to the point that you just read a wall of text and then click the only option presented to you.\n\nI tried to make it to the end, hearing that it tries to accurately simulate depression, by taking the colour out of the world but I just couldn't get to the end of it. I was incredibly bored and I couldn't even get worked up over it anymore, the music was just depressing the hell out of me and I found myself trapped in a seemingly endless monotonous cycle, where I just read text and clicked options, that weren't mine.\n\nI've always been very liberal with my definition of what a game is, some said that Dear Esther wasn't a game and I argued against that but this? I don't know, I don't believe that it is a 'game' as you could recreate the experience by listening to a playlist of every depressing song/theme you know, whilst reading something off of fanfiction.net and occasionally slapping yourself across the face.\n\nIn conclusion; I wouldn't recommend it, I don't believe that it is an accurate portrayal of depression and I struggle to see where the 'it's a game!' argument is coming from.\n\nIf you want a better experience, I'd recommend Dear Esther or To the Moon over this as both are much better interractive stories.","August 25, 2014","false","0.6"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","5"

At least Japanese Visual Novels have, you know, visuals, or sometimes a gameplay element of some sort. DQ on the the otherhand is as bland as they come.\n\nIt's made by a "Social Media Activist/Clictivist" and it really shows. While the game might related to some people on some levels, the main character is bothered by the most trivial of things, making it obvious the game was written by a SJW tumblrette. The game reduces the character's choice the worse your depression gets. Makes sense right? You feel moody, you probably aren't going to be as motivated to do certain things. The problem here is that the MC is too pathetic to blame his problems on depression. His problem isn't that he's depressed, his problem is that he's too beta. See, the game has you step into the shoes of this character but all this does is make it feel like you have no control over the outcomes in any given situation.\n\nIf it makes you feel any better, this developer has no idea what depression is like anyway outside of being called out on Twitter. The person who made this doesn't even like gamers and I think that speaks volumes for the quality of the game. Don't believe me? https://imgur.com/a/4VOcx#HpTwnYl How could a game made by someone who holds such contempt for gamers, and with people suffering from actual depression possibly make a good game?\n\nIn short, DQ is a short "game" that can be beat in less than 5 minutes. I got a good ending my first time just picking the obvious "social" choices. Unfortunately, I was unable to find a way to an hero on purpose so that was quite disappointing.

(freudian slip of the developers, perhaps?)\n\nAnyways, in the story you can get a pet kitten. Highlight of the game.\n\nOn that note, it is not really much a "game" as much as a "take some mostly irrelevent choices that we think reflect depressed people's thoughts" sort of thing. The design is mostly text and images with links. This is closer to a choose your own adventure book, a shallow one at that.\nThe imagination here is very paint by numbers and does not portray depression as anything other than a woe is me dithering, to the point where it's downright insulting to the science behind depression as well as misrepresentative of depression in sufferers as a whole.\n\nBut umm... kitty... going in between people's legs... (The writers are oh so cleverly subtle)\nI, by no means like freudian phychology, but this game's writing makes a very compelling argument for it.\n\nConclusivly, this choose your own adventure book (because calling it a game is highly demeaning to the gaming industry, forsooth, it is insulting to adventure books akin) comes off as an abusive exploitation of the depressed, and is downright offensive to the reader's (player would suggest gameplay) intelligence, shows and pervades a contempt for humanity, and portrays the depressed as unlikeable slobs who are to blame for their own issues.\n\nCons\n-Choose your own adventure book pampered up as a "game".\n-Insults your intelligence.\n-Demeaning to men and women alike.\n-Comes off as abusive.\n-Taunts with choices you cannot choose.\n\nPro\n-Kitten.\n-Wonderous example of irony.","August 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Just a terrible mess of a game.\nWhere do I even begin? From a gameplay standpoint, it's boring. There's nothing visually stimulating (and while I realize that's not the point with choose your own adventure games-but something semi-decent would have been nice, a background to simulate scene changes), and it's all too easy to get the good ending if you have even a sliver of an idea how choose your own adventure games work. The story is bland at best and does nothing to suck the player in and make them care about the character their playing as. Honestly, 3/4 of the way through and I found myself skimming the mammoth-sized paragraphs of crap just to get to my options. Speaking of options, why cross out the ones that would actually help you? I'm speaking from an odd position here, as I have never been diagnosed with depression, but it feels strange that, in an attemtpt to simulate someone being depressed you wouldn't present the helpful option as an option. To the people who played this game who actually have depression, did that feel condescending at all? Plus, the character is completely self-absorbed. There's a point in the game where one of your friends is having some nasty issues in their life and instead of consoling them, you can choose to just ignore him because you feel that you have it worse. Even though this person is a life-long friend you can still opt to turn your back on them. And a trigger warning?

Yeah I get it, it's meant to be a spiral, but I don't think it's the greatest representation even from an individual standpoint. It's more like someone's idea of what they think depression should be like, but comes off more like someone who's just whiny and can't help themselves without managing to incite any understanding or compassion at all. Can think of many better resources for people wanting to read up more on what depression is.\n\nIt's also concerning the play though I did at least, makes out like there is no end to it and you'll be miserable your entire life which I think is very misrepresented and a dangerous message, especially for those with current clinical depression.

This piece of indie shovelware is not a game at all.  It is a despicable mock on people with depression.  Superman 64 is said to be one of the worst games of all time, and I can find myself prefering that to this because it has gameplay.  Even E.T. for the Atari 2600 has more potential.

I hesitate calling it a "game" because it isn't one. It's a horrible fictional novel that is as bland as my personality and is pretty much false in how depression is handled. This game teaches you that if you have depression, you're doomed and there's no going back. Having depression myself, this is not the case. It's about fixing your issues and making yourself happy. This game, no matter what, will give you proper options that'll do anything to make you happy in slightest.

What I noticed first were some typographical errors, which would be negligible if not for this game being almost exclusively text-oriented. Also, since I find it difficult to concentrate on large areas of text for long periods of time, I think having a save state of some sort would have been a nice addition to the game, especially since the developer was generous enough to include a graphic showing how to "play" this game with a controller.\n\nAs far as content goes, I think that since the protagonist is supposed to be you (the player), I think that “Alex” (your girlfriend in the game) should have been a neuter character so people of all sexual orientations (not just lesbians) could better relate – there was a huge opportunity to do so, what with “Alex” being a unisex nickname, and since this game is meant to simulate what it feels like to be clinically depressed, I think it would have better immersed the player in that world.\n\nOther than these few minor nitpicks, it does have a semi-interesting story, and as someone who has suffered from clinical depression myself, it does have relatable elements. I didn't finish because it was too long for me to complete in one sitting and I couldn't find a way to bookmark my place to pick it up later (as I stated before, save states would have been useful). I think this game could use more development, but it does have potential, and I can honestly say I got what I paid for from Depression Quest.","December 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","15","19","2","0"

Thus, my view of this piece of "interactive (non)fiction" isn't the product of going in completely blind.\n\nI don't have any problems with visual novels, "story games," and "walking simulators" on principle, since they can be great experiences if executed well (insert plug for The Stanley Parable here). However, Depression Quest has some major issues that ultimately cause it to fall flat. The writing is poor on a technical level: it's difficult to get immersed in a text-heavy experience when you have to wrestle with typos, ambiguous pronoun references, and unnecessary alliteration. In addition, instead of being written in a way that evokes certain emotions in the reader, Depression Quest explicitly tells you how you feel every step of the way. This caused me to approach the experience in a disconnected, analytical manner. Finally, perhaps due to my disconnect with the "player character," it was far too simple to determine the proper series of choices to guide the character toward a solution to their depression (protip: don't lay in bed all week).\n\nIn conclusion, although I personally can't speak to whether or not Depression Quest is an accurate representation of chronic depression, I couldn't force myself to care about the events in the story due to awkward, weak execution. But hey, if you don't believe me, it's free and only takes about half an hour to go through once, so it's not too hard to form your own opinion.","October 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","16","21","0","0"

It's the typical 'no one loves me/I'm a burden' stuff and it's basic. There was nothing to draw me into the story and the best part of the game was probably the picture of the cat. This felt more like a chore and not a form of 'entertainment' (for lack of better words). It was boring, plain, and a waste of time. The choices you make have very little effect on the aactual game as the game will have the same outcome, and that is no real outcome. Either you do good and get over it or you do bad and you dont. If this game is trying to show someone how it feels to be depressed, it's failing horribly. Making decisions isn't as easy as clicking a button. You cant show someone how it is to be depressed through a video game. If you want to try and see what it's like for someone who's going through a depression and struggling, go play The Cat Lady.\nOverall, this game was a disappointment and could possibly be one of the worst games I've played in my entire 18 years.\n","September 22, 2014","false","0.2"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Is it enticing to the mood?) - 1\nGenre Structure - 1\nReturn Factor - 1\nAverage Score - 2\n\nAs everyone knows, a game is entitled a fair chance. 'Depression Quest' is unique in its development as it brings forward the viewpoints and emotional curtains that define depression. However, it is only applicable to one scenario. It in fact plays through the possible actions of a single person in a very specific environment. The limited actions allow for smooth transitioning, but are generally lacking for what gamers consider to be a developing title.\n\nWith all else said and done, the game was fairly straight-forward in its guided direction. Did you fight through the depression, or did you succumb to what would be a vision-altering take on an individuals inner turmoil. With multiple paths to choose from which gradually became more and more limited as time progressed, one could feel restricted to their options, an argument which invalidates the free-thought that many gamers wish to experience. With no real graphical rendering save for a very contrasting back-drop to the text, I found my eyes hurting and straining, consistently reminding myself that this game looked more like a website than an actual game. There wasn't any Artificial Intelligence to interact with so the choices seemed rather stale in comparison to other titles. As for the images that did perceive themselves, the images were repetative and didn't give an ebb or flow to the text, so when it came up with changes in time, it felt much like a car slamming into a concrete baricade, and other times it felt like time was at a stand-still.\n\nThe music was a single repetitive track that played itself over and over again and was almost maddening in and of itself, so the feel was genuinely successful, but the music felt out of place at many points in the story line. As a fast reader, I was able to play through this game in roughly twenty minutes with all possible endings. On that note, the gameplay was very short, and the replay factor was damaged by my own personal abilities. That being said, it felt short and fairly lacking in immersive content. Credit shall be given, however, into the emotions that the game drew out. Having suffered from depression myself, a majority of the situations actually forced myself to review my own experiences in some self-reflection and as I am writing this, I can't help but feel emotionally connected to the game. However, I must remain clinical and give an honest review, and so my personal feelings will be directed in a more professional manner.\n\nThe last questions that come to mind are fairly straight-forward. Is this a game, and does it befit the genre advertised? The answer to these questions is an undeniable, "No." Depression Quest feels more like a book that you would select your choice, and then turn the page to reveal your decision's consequence, whether it be positive, negative, or neutral. As well, with Depression Quest having the graphical interface of a web-page or flash-based game, it did not feel like it belonged on Steam as a Green-Light. With all this said, it also cannot be considered a Role-Playing Game as it doesn't fit the criteria to be considered a game.\n\nOn a personal note, I feel that Depression Quest was fairly enlightening and would definately help others feel what depression is. As much as I can relate to it, I feel this would be better as a graphic novel or a short-story rather than a video-game. As a video-game, I stick by my rating of '2 out of 5" and would not recommend this game over-all, but on a personal scale, I feel that this could become something better if it were applied in a different application.\n\nIf you like this review, please be sure to head over to my Twitter or my Facebook (both will be linked below) and leave a follow/like.

It also doesn't count in any of the problems that come with it, like forgetfulness, irrational input evaluation and the side effects of medication.\nIt seems like the game is about someone who is having a hard time being depressed, rather than suffering from a major depressive disorder.\n\ntldr; Not in-depth, but okay story.

Hahaha, oh wow\n\nIn all seriousness it's a interactive story about some random guy and his depression and you have to direct his actions via multiple choice outcomes. You could probably speed play through it in 1 minute; there's not that much of a story to it. It's not really that much of a game. Maybe it could've been considered one back in the 80s or 90s when they had those interactive text based ones, but even those usually were a lot longer than this and more interesting as well.\n\nNow I don't like to use Ad hominems but the broad who made this, Zoe Qunin, didn't even make it directly. She got help from some game makers who were doing a project where they'd help inexperienced women make games. After they helped her make this, she attacked them! Also, after Robin Williams took his life (rest in piece, you were one of the few celebrities I actually felt horrible from after they died) she tried to cash in on that to promote her game more.

It is a depiction of someone who is depressed. There is in fact a difference here.\nMuch of the text trivializes the long term issues and makes it appear as if this is something the character is just now dealing with, as in it suddenly appeared. While it is possible for someone with untreated clinical depression to have a girlfriend, a job, a (apparent) group of friends, and overall live a normal life, that is near miraculous as depicted in this game. I attempted to self-manage my depression for years without help, and can tell you that social withdrawal and self-esteem issues are pretty much a given in this kind of situation.\nI truly think this 'game' utterly fails to depict the mental state of someone with clinical depression. There are a number of issues with the presentation, even aside from the inexplicably understanding people surrounding the character, such as the portrayal of anti-social behavior as a direct result of depression. Some people genuinely don't like other people, and have issues connecting with them, thus seeing avoidance as a way to not have to deal with the added stress trying to deal with that you don't understand creates. I know I'm anti-social. I also know that my being anti-social has nothing to do with my depression, but more to do with just not having the desire for social interaction. That is the root cause of anti-social behavior in most people. Social withdrawal is getting so anti-social that it begins to affect your life negatively.\nMoving on from that, I cannot call this an accurate portrayal of even caricaturized depression. It portrays someone who is depressed, and fails to do that very well, due to a number of misconceptions on the creator's part on what depression is, and on what the effects are.","September 1, 2014","false","0.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","3"

Despite the short amount of time it took to complete, it felt like an eternity.\n\nI wanted to give it a fair chance, but there was no game here. The design of the game is just lazy. It's so bland and uninteresting to look at that I really couldn't focus on the story. It's white background, with black text, and a picture on top that pertains to the story.\n\nWhenever I could actually look at what was going on, I was extremely disappointed in the lack of originality of the situation I was in. The story is that I have a girlfriend and family who all love me and are concerned about my depression. WHOOP-DEE-DOO!!! I got excited when someone gave me a kitten. I thought that would make it a good game, but the cat POSSIBLY only shows up one other time. There was no connection with any of the characters really since they're all nothing more than cliches.\n\nThe game has a total of ONE TRACK of a short piano piece on a loop. There will be background noises sometimes depending on the area which can make this short track even more annoying than it actually is. I would go insane listening to it as I merely got the gist of what was going on. I can't imagine what would happen if I took the time to go over all the details.\n\nThe whole thing about this game is making choices. It doesn't matter how many choices the GAME says there are because in reality there are only two every time. There can be 6 choices the GAME gives you, but there are really only two. It lists some options only to cross them out because you're "TOO DEPRESSED" which is just the most infuriating thing a game about choices can do. I understand my character is depressed, but don't tell me you're restricting my options because of this. Depression doesn't mean incapable of choosing to do enjoyable things. Depression doesn't make some options impossible, but it does make some options more difficult to make because of the emotional weight that just doesn't seem like something to bring around other people. The choices that were presented in this game seemed like they were made to guide the player towards one over the others. I can't choose the crossed out option, but I can choose the option that's the crossed out option with different words. The obvious right option sometimes is actually not always the obvious right option for someone who isn't depressed. The writers basically assume that this is how a normal life should be and anyone who isn't living like this is depressed. I don't have time for parties, internet interaction, and Netflix with a girlfriend when MY JOB is on the line. Depression should have nothing to do with that. Do my choices really matter? Only when it comes down to choosing to see a therapist and taking medicine is when it truly matters. The game is always telling you that you're not doing those things, so obviously the player can deduce that those are the things that must be done in order to win the game. In the real world a therapist and medication does NOT fix all cases of depression. Sometimes these things cause people to become more lost and more depressed.\n\nI do not believe that this game depicts depression exactly. There are many ways people can struggle with depression and I've only seen one very generic and uneducated depiction in Depression Quest. The writing is made to make your character obviously sad when sometimes it's not always so obvious even to those affected by this terrible state of mind. I, along with some of the other reviewers here, have struggled with depression and know how it feels. The game gives a trigger warning to anyone who has been depressed that this game might be too real and may emulate our own lives too well. IT DOES NOT!!! If anything it offends and belittles anyone in this very serious condition. I know it wasn't their intention to do so, but that's how I feel about it.\n\nDepression Quest is a pretentious way of bring attention to this issue. I'm not even happy that some of the money they receive to support this game goes to the Suicide Hotline. It should ALL go to the Suicide Hotline. It's insulting to think how these people have made money off of this. At the very least, it is at the least totally free if we choose it to be that way.\n\n1/10 since it was free. Play it if you want, but your time is better spent elsewhere.","March 21","false","0.3"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

You don't make the choices in the game, instead, the developer has already crossed off certain options in order to force you down the same bad ending. Depression Quest only tries to show the worst case scenario for depression, not at all acknowledging that it is treatable by the choices you make, instead, it portrays the only way to treat depression is with pills and a therapist. Notice how I said "tries", because even then everyone in the "game" acts like a complete idiot around the player.\n\nAccuracy aside, this is just a poor excuse for a "game". From the static overlay constantly on the screen in a pathetic attempt to make the mediocre story seem "deep" to the lack of multiple endings with your choices basically doing nothing, there's a reason this game's top reviews are mostly negative.","January 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 50 of 86 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","50","86","2","0"

You read the situation and their thoughts and you dictate the choice... Depression dosnt work like this. While it does tell you why they feel like the "Bad" option AFTER you pick its a very 'Do the right thing' game.\n\nHowever I will give it this I wanted it to continue for longer because I was somehow enjoying it BUT that was also the problem I played a run through for first time taking 30 minutes...\n\nOver all it was more of a time waster than anything giving you a skin deep look at depression coulda been better","September 20, 2014","false","0.6"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

All this story does is tell the reader about the authors point of view on depression from what seems to be from a female mindset, which is not educating people correctly on the matter.\n\nThis story doesn't express the difficulty of actually dealing with depression and how frustrated and hopeless you actually feel when dealing with this illness and even though the charactor refers to being 'exhausted' and 'emotionally drained', this is not the whole of what people feel in their battle with depression. This so called game is wrongly educating people on the subject.\nAlso, if you're struggling with depression this 'game' is not for you, as all it does is make you feel worse about yourself and the direction in which your own life is going, so don't waste your time on this poor excuse of a game.\n\nOverall, the music is terrible and repetative, the story is inacurate about the struggles of depression and it is wrongly categorised (this is most certainly not an RPG).","August 22, 2014","false","1.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"
