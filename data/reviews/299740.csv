Grabbed his gear and moved on.  Found another body with a cross... necklace... thing... I took it for good luck. After walking around for an hour trapped in the wilderness, checking out the graphics and immersity. I then stumbled upon a player, gave him a helmet and hammer. I never saw him again. I then found a bridge and found a fresh spawn, gave him gloves... Never saw him again. After continuious walking in circles in the wilderness I finally found civilisation. I looted the suberbs and found an empty gun. I then heard somebody in the house next to me. Curious, I stepped outside, and saw the dreaded Bushman waiting in the plants outside. I ran for my life, then circled into another house and found a clip of ammo. Confident I walked outside with my new weapon. Annnnd... the Bushman was waiting outside, he opened fire first, I returned fire.He had much more ammo, I eventually ran into a bush and waited for my demise.I then did not accept defeat, I rushed him with my hatchet.And then... I got capped in the head and fell over and died. Bushman will pay...\n\nDay 2:\nAfter dieing horribly, I respawned somewhere in the country side, I then saw a mutant.\nIt killed me very easily. I then respawned yet again and actually did some looting in sultan. I was then attacked by a Mutant, died horribly. Yet another respawn, I started to loot yet again, I then was attacked by ANOTHER mutant. I barely survived. After I healed up I went outside, I was then in the middle of a gun fight between 2 people. The Bushman and a guy with pink pants. Bushman ran away, but pink pants opened fire on me. I ran for my life, having no firearm at the time I always had to keep running away from basically everything. I thought going into the mall to look for bandages was a good idea... I then saw 4 people all standing in the corner. I was killed instantly...\n\nDay 3:\nAfter yet again being mowed down by a storm of bullets, I looted various houses around the countryside. I was lucky to find a gun and 1 clip of ammo... Seems familiar. I then walked, and walkeduntill I reached a bridge.I saw someone in the distance...It was... BUSHMAN! We starred at eachother, waiting for somebody to fire the first shot. He eventually gave in and opened fire. I fired back. I was the better aim, I thought I had the advantage. I then saw movement to my right, he had friends, 2 of them to be exact. I fired my last clip of ammo into them, then began to run into the forest.\nNot surprsingly I bled out in the forest... Time to start again... I respawned yet again, and walked all the way back to Sultan. I was pretty sure I wouldn't get my gear back, I would die trying. After getting myself a hatchet and gear, it was getting dark. I had just finished scavenging a house, I walked outside into the night then 2 people walked right on up. I said hi, they said hi, then they bashed me on the head. I briefly replied by slamming my hatchet into his shoulder. I fought with them toe to toe, dodging attacks and swinging my hatchet at them. But I was outnumbered, They had more firepower than me. I ran towards a bridge, with them on my tail. I knew they would follow me to the end of the earth. That gave me an Idea, so I said to them: "You know kids, it's been real fun but I ain't giving you the pleasure". So I dove off the bridge myself, I died instantly, but atleast they wouldn't have the pleasure of killing and looting me. I then heard to splashes in the river... They were that dumb to jump into the river and cause their deaths... They weren't the sharpest knives in the drawer.\n\nDay 4:\nI respawn back near Sultan again, and begin to loot. I get some Green Camo gear and a hatchet then went afk inside the church for a bit. On my return I see a man with a Black Helmet, Black jacket, Black boots and gloves... With no pants. He seemed hesitant, he kept peeking through the door. Then he struck, he sliced me with his own Hatchet, I soon retaliated. We decided to take this outside, then the battle began. It was intense, I landed the most hits, and he was wounded. Then I turned around and saw another man in the same Uniform as the other, but with a gun. I'll take you both on! I fought and fought, blood stained the floor, and hatchet man was weak, he retreated behind the church and ran for his life. Gun guy was still trying to shoot me. But I closed in and kept on slicing him up. He was getting weak as well. He retreated to the front of the church. I followed.Just as I thought I had him, We both turned the corner and... There were... 8 other people... All with Black helmets, jackets and boots... All with no pants... And all had a gun pointed at my head. I then thought to myself at this exact moment: "Well crap, it's Attack of the Clones all over again". I realised the error in my ways and tried to run. Obviously you know I never make it out alive.\nI then respawned, l proceeded to look through various houses trying to find something to protect myself with. I then walked into a small house with only 2 floors. As I walked upstairs I saw some blood on the wall, there was a dead body slouched on the floor under the blood stains... Fully geared. The clone army must've gotten to him. I grabbed his gear and ran outside. I then saw another man, we looked at eachother briefly and he walked off towards the petrol station. I turn around and see some scouts from the clone army run towards me... Hurray... I hid in some bushes and they walked right past me... Hiding is so easy. The only problem is, I think they just killed that man I met. Hopefully they thought it was me Just when I think I'm safe I walk out of my bush, And get shot by the clone army...\n\nDay 5:\nI began to loot Sultan yet again... I got a gun, some military gear, and was punched to death by a man in yellow. I respawned and found 2 dead bodies on the road, each with guns. A man I passed earlier also saw this, grabbed a gun from a body and shot me twice. Unluckly for him, I had a weapon as well. 6 shots hit his stomach. He fell to his knees looking at me, dropped his gun, fell down and died. I then met a man and showed mercy on him, he'd wandered into the fight. I pormised I'd protect him and I did. I got him gear and weapons, we then decided to go our seperate ways. I then found a jungle camo shirt and was shot in the very same house where I lost my other Military Gear. I respawned yet again and found a dead body near a gas station. I took his loot and walked down to Sultan, then gunshots ran out and 2 bullets landed next to me... It came from... A bush... At that moment I knew who he was and what he wanted. It was Bushman. I ran back towards the gas station and hid. I waited for awhile then moved up to the road. I looked for every possible angle he could've shot me from. I turned my head and saw a man running up another road. Bushman... I followed him in hot pursuit. I followed him through the bushes to avoid detection. I went down a dirt road and saw a dead body, he was definitly here. I then followed him throughout the countryside. I heard his footsteps now and again but never saw him. He was a master of stealth. I followed him to the trailer park and heard him rummaging through a fridge, I ran over the that direction when I took a shot. He was here alright, and he knew I was following him. I lost his trail eventually and headed back to Sultan were I got myself a hatchet and better clothing. As I was looting one house I heard gunshots ring out. I ran outside to see Bushman chasing a man down. I followed, as I turned the corner I saw Bushman standing over the body of the man he was chasing. He'd killed him. I snuck up behind him and struck, brining my hatchet down into his neck. He turned around and tried to hit me with his hammer, but it was no use. He was weak after his previous fight. Just as I was about to stike him down... The server crashed, and he was gone.","December 5, 2014","true","235.1"," 784 of 897 people (87%) found this review helpful 254 people found this review funny","87","784","897","254","57"

I say it’s for the best. I think it creates a very real survival feel, I also don't feel as safe when I'm wandering at night because someone could come shoot me if they wanted my stuff.\n\nTo me it feels like real survival game. you wouldn't run in to people like every 5 min in real life situation like this, and npc enemies wouldn't be just everywhere either. This game has great potential. I would love to see it get popular. The thing that bugs me is people are giving it crap reviews when it’s not at all a crap game. They see no others and say no thanks and it’s going to make it less popular given the mixed reviews. So if you are reading this buy it if you realize its early access. There are 12 passionate devs at work here to make the game the best it can be, don't give it ♥♥♥♥ reviews while they still building it.\n\nEDIT:\n\nMy god this game is fricken amazing, the devs are awesome too, I went and watched the stream and was able to actually chat with them and ask questions as to why glitches occur and how often they update, they told me they have a lot of stuff coming out! Exciting stuff.\n\nSo gameplay wise I am on three servers, US 77, 76, 75. All different experiences I must say. Here’s what’s up:\n\n75: I was wandering and saw a stripped down truck (they are brighter than other abandoned cars and can access their inventory to build again) so okay I start to go look for parts for it and I find a few, as I’m wandering down the middle of the road like a dumbass I look to my left as I see some movement and there is two guys dressed in all black with rifles pointed at me in the bushes....MOTHER OF GOD. Thankfully they didn’t want anything to do with me and slowly kept their guns on me and walked away while doing so. After that met another player who was fresh spawn and told him about my car, risky stuff because he could have murdered me and took it when I showed him where it was. We start scavenging parts together and come across another newbie while doing so and he has one the parts we need, he joins...awesome three can easy be super safe in a world of survival. We get all the pieces together and are driving the truck around its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. We come across another player and ask him if he wants to join he is a little hesitant but hops on the back of the truck, then we met another guy and he joined. So I’m rolling around the map with a badass truck and a team of 5 people and we own it. Server did crash and we lost some progress but hey its alpha and those 5 hours were ♥♥♥♥ing amazing.\n\n76: Play on this server with on buddy, we’ve been to all four towns twice looking for cars as we both had been carrying max weight of parts for it and we were all set up. Two days of looking and we run into some other people....of course they say they don’t want trouble and that they are friendly, they run down the street while we start raiding a grocery store. My buddy tells me that he hears footsteps, these mofos came back and are trying to murder us while we not paying attention. We get into a 15 minute fire and melee battle with these guys, I go down first and my friend kills another but then he dies. We start all over. = real survival game...I aint even mad.\n\n77: I play solo and record video on this server. Spawn next to river....four people on a boat show up and say they friendly and that they will give me ride to town, I take risk and hop in...BOOM HEADSHOT I die. Respawn and start looting houses turn around and there’s a geared up guy looking straight at me in the hallway. ♥♥♥♥ My pants. He’s nice and gives me a bat with nails and some food. Helps me find more gear and we kill some mutants together. He tells me we going to just stick together and anyone else we will murder and rob....sounds okay I’ve had my fair share of being nice. We walking about and then there is another guy down the street who is mega hesitant to come to us we meet him in middle of street and my new partner is like "we just want to kill zombies and survive we don’t rob people" guys is like sweet first nice people I’ve met. My buddy starts punching him and then I guess us robbing this guy so I chase him with my bat. Enemy pulls out a revolver and two shots me...respawn stay 100% solo and started robbing people with a .22 rifle with no ammo (but they don’t know that hehe).\n\nNeedless to say this game is intense, feels real, buy it, if you don’t like it in 2 hours return it. But don’t give it crappy reviews while it’s in alpha. I doubt it will stop these passionate devs but they deserve all the positivity in the world.\n\nIf you aren’t convinced yet and need video proof I do make YouTube videos of my adventures with friends in Miscreated. There are a lot of videos in the series, feel free to check it out :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_uJGecF97sNUrgY6psHpNJ4Z9mJhN2mZ","October 13, 2015","true","79.6"," 126 of 137 people (92%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","92","126","137","13","8"

Reluctantly I went inside, and my friend stayed back to cover my escape. I went to a room looking for some supplies, but when I went to the bathroom. I saw something that still haunts me, a man sitting in the tub with a shotgun. Quickly, I turned around and screamed. Destroying my friends hearing in the process.\n\nI nimbly jumped down five feet to safety, and broke my leg. My character was in agonizing pain, but I ran for my life. Behind me I heard the echoing sounds of bullets being fired, but that didn't stop a "brave" man. The sound of bullets were suppressed by my cries for help. In the distance I saw my friend standing behind a wall, and I knew that safety was within my grasp.\n\nI dodged the bullets with swift action (and a little bit of luck). I ran behind my friend and thought the event was over, but little did I know. I heard a quick swoosh and the crunching sound of bullet hitting skull. My friend fell down in front of me, struck down by a sniper hiding in the city. My broken leg would have to wait, because now it was time to survive. I had to leave him for the roaches, and I ran into the forest. Leaving the little bit of humanity I had left in the process. My leg hurt more and more, but the reality of the situation pushed me on. I hastily threw myself down in a bush, and started to work on my broken leg.\n\nI patched up my leg, and I was relieved. I was sure that this day would be my last, but again I had fought and beaten the odds. I rummaged through my backpack, looking for something to eat. All I had was a chocolate bar, and some water. I sat up and began to feast, thinking back at what I lost and silently wept.\n\nThen I heard the sound of my faith, the echoing drum of death was closing in. Played through a cheap headset, getting closer every second. My entire excistence was filled with the sound of "You can't see me". His punches were swift, and death came within seconds. The last thing I saw was his crotch leaning down on my face. I didn't see the heavens gate, but instead I saw balls. I didn't hear the choir of the angels, but I heard terrible rap music. I did not feel joy, but only suffering. I knew that I had been defeated at last. Looks like I wasn't that lucky after all...\n\nI rate this game 10/10. Would love to get traumatized again","October 25, 2015","true","6.6"," 153 of 174 people (88%) found this review helpful 149 people found this review funny","88","153","174","149","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meepeY/recommended/299740/","meepeY","meepeY@Dreamhack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meepeY/","71 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n[EDIT1 at the bottom]\n\nTo sum this game up in a single word, I would choose "Potential".\n\nTo be 100% truthful, it's not worth the pricetag... Yet.\nThe game has the potential to be somthing spectacular. With over 500 Hours wasted playing "Nether", to see it die to hackers, glitches, bugs, a lazy dev team and exploters was something saddening. Miscreated has reignited the spark which I previously had for Nether.\n\nThe game, for starters, is stunning. The engine used gives us a large, expansive open world (ish, they've cut the size down for  Alpha testing), filled with beatuiful landscapes and detailed cities. One thing which grabbed me is that in the video I watched, I saw houses filled with furniture. Not empty, bland, blank rooms. You actually have to look for things. Items don't just jump out at you... Whilst at the moment, finding food and water is super easy. I'm not a fan of that. Loot does seem to come easy as long as you have your eye out for it.\n\nGuns and Weapons. They're limited in varaity but not in quantity... Unfortunately. But with it being in such an early Alpha, the fact that there is only 1 Gun and a small handfull of melee weapons kind of sucks. From what I've been reading is that there are plenty on the way. So far the gun play feels smooth and fluid. It CAN at times feel clunky. It depends on how you're playing.\n\nFirst and Third person. No no no no no no noooooooooooo... If they get rid of Third person then the game would be fantastic. At the moment, Third person is a little buggy. The camera doesn't exactly follow you well and it doesn't provide you with the view you may want at the time. Indoors the Third Person camera just ♥♥♥♥♥ itself and cowers up closer to the back of your head, making it difficult to see.\nCharacter models are sketchy at best. They may just be basic place holders but holy crap. The mutant does look very... Out dated. But it's alpha. Lots of changes can happen very suddenly.\n\nThe mutants themselves have very clunky AI. They run at you, lunge with their arms then just run into you. As long as you just AFK wheel backwards, they will NEVER swing for you. You just bash their heads with a hammer or something 5 or 6 times and they die... Not exactly scary or intense... Alpha be alpha.\n\nProviding the devs add reasonable items and changes then it should smooth out fine. In a matter of months I see this game looking in a stable spot to start bringing in a larger fan base.\nIf the devs start adding lots of useless things (Like Nether did), without fixing existing errors (Like Nether did), then the game will die. Very fast.\n\nI do believe also that people have been troubled when trying to join servers. I have NOT*** experienced any of these problems. Some bloke who shot me in-game told me the servers were fixed. I dunno, i've not had those problems.\n\nI recommend you buy the game and play one session. If you don't like it, come back to it after the new year. If you do like it, then keep your eye on the updates (which the devs roll out every week or so).\nI will update this every now and then, after big updates.\n\n[EDIT1] So after playing some more, it crossed my mind that the game is lacking a player-list. Even if it's something simple like "There are 10 Survivors on this server". I joined a low-pop (1 other player) to stream some gameplay to a friend when suddenly it became the high-pop.\n\nAlso, reloading. You have to go into your inventory and swap out the mag. In the heat of the moment going from bang-bang-bang to click-click-click makes my heart drop. It would be great even as a QoL change to add some form of reloading. It could load the magazine with the most amount of ammo in.\nSomething like that.\n\nThe devs have releaed a long statement today which only brightens the promise this game has. A new rifle, shotgun and more melee weapons. Fantastic. This game right now is headed in the right direction. If the devs ever read this review, then hats off to you guys. 2 Years in the making and you can really see how well their hardwork has paid off.\n\nThe bugs i have found so far are as follows:\n- Third Person screws up in closed areas\n- Some form of unknown action stops you from being able to switch weapons (I think it's swimming)\n- Some loot underneath small tables spawns out of reach (RIP 30+ Round Magazine for my Pistol)\n- Some houses are completely empty and have texture glitches (Could just be unfinished houses, not a big deal)\n- Sometimes when joining a server, you get kicked back to the lobby screen. ***I stated above that I haven't had these problems, but recently it's happened to me once or twice.\n\nI haven't come across anything else other than those... Pretty damn good for an early access.\n\nKeep up the good work.","November 27, 2014","true","11.5"," 176 of 208 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","176","208","3","6"

I cannot wait for the new item system and storage. As of right now this game is def worth a buy but please be aware that right now the game is mostly just exploring and PVP.\n\nThe first 50 hours or so, will be exploring the wonderful, pretty, immersive world that the Devs have created. After that, all you will be doing is walking the map ( or camping a certain spot of the map which is weak, but w/e) for people to shoot. Trust me, I have over 1k hours in the game, and I have been PVPing like crazy. One thing that blows me away in this game is the water Physics. When you shoot the water, you can see it tread, and you can see the bullet wiz through the water. Amazing Yoo.\n\nAs of right now, I have been laying low on Miscreated playing other survival games just waiting for the new content and storage system. I know for certain once they add storage, Miscreated will once again be my main and favorite game.\n\nOne thing people need to be aware of is that the game does take a lot to run. It is made off the Crytek engine which is obviously very graphic intensive and harsh on your PC. I mean my GPU which is a 770 OC gets up to 80 C on this game. I can run the game on low settings with 60 FPS (with Frame Drops in towns). Also this game is not very optimized with AMD cards. It will work, but you wont get the best experience out of it.\n\nAnyways like I mentioned earlier in my review, I would highly reccomend this game to anyone who likes open world survival PVP games. This game feels like a much much, much more polished up DayZ in almost every way. Just buy it Yoo and support the wonderful, active Devs. This game is going to go a loooong way.\n\nUpdate: Still really enjoying this game with friends. Been waiting for the next patch. The only thing that is holding the game back right now is the various crashing. Very frusterating. Really hope this is addressed in the next patch. Biggest flaw of the game Imo. Looking forward to the future progress of the game :D","February 18","true","300.9"," 109 of 120 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","109","120","8","8"

I won't say it's BETTER than DayZ ,H1Z1,Rust or the myriad survival games out there, but it is the game I keep coming back to and am still having fun playing.\n\nOriginal Review Apr '15\n\nI'm a big fan of Miscreated and would recommend it even at this early stage of development. I've played and still play DayZ and played and had refunded H1Z1. I even log into Rust every now and again just to, you know, see what craziness is unfolding.\n\nWhat attracted me to Miscreated and I think it's biggest draw is the environment, it's beautiful in the truest sense of the word.  Obviously a game isn't and shouldn't just be about graphics, but in helping with immersion in a post apocalyptic world a rich full environment really helps with the game play. The towns feel overgrown like nature is reclaiming them, everything as a weight and substance about it. It's difficult to describe until you play it.\n\nCaveats :\n\nIt is most definitely an early access game (isn't everything these days). It's not perfect and the developers need to keep up the momentum of development to draw in new players and keep the old players interested and what I've seen they are giving it a good go live streaming, providing regular patches and updating the community. They'll be the first to admit they've had issues most recently network problems and I bought it as these problems were being solved as I saw the developers engaging and informing the community of their progress not just going silent.\n\nConclusion :\n\nThis isn't just a DayZ / H1Z1 clone and  I think it deserves to be played by more people. I can't think of anywhere I'd rather spend my post apocalyptic time.","March 26, 2015","true","394.8"," 107 of 124 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","107","124","3","7"

Why spend ages to loot houses when you can simply steal from your fellow man. The role of the bad guy is essential to this game as it gives the good "team up" guys somebody to fight as well as providing loot in a quick manner.\n\nThe bad element also makes meeting another player a tense scenario - Here is an example of one such meeting I had the other night.\nIts night, you are in a house searching for bullets to a gun you've found and you notice a flashlight searching a house across the road. Looking at the setup of the road its logical that the person is going to check this house next. You slow to a steady walk to reduce your footsteps in the house to avoid alerting the approaching stranger. Time to think about how this is going to play out - either they kill you or they simply say hello and move on. You know from previous rendezvous that its 70/30 that they will kill you for your loot. You have the upper hand with the dark and the opportunity of ambush, why take the risk? You watch them leave the house while turning off their torch and notice a back pack and a long barrelled weapon slung over the shoulder. Could be plenty of loot carried by this one.. You hear them enter the house and the tell-tale click of the torch, this means no weapon in-hand, another advantage. the mystery person searches the front room, kitchen and dining area and heads for the stairs... He stops as the light makes out a shape at the top of the stairs... We both sit there, me looking at the light of the torch, him looking at my shotgun pointed down the narrow staircase - no way he can dodge the blast at this range. A tentative voice comes over the in-game voice system "Hey man" I don't respond immediately... Now he's worried that death is seconds away, the last 30 - 40 minutes of him searching for loot could be wasted in this meeting in the dark. I know that if his flashlight switches off he has pulled a gun.. The moment is tense, I finally speak 'Got any ammo for the 1911 .45?'. He responds with a glimmer of hope 'Yeah sure, just don't shoot - I'll drop some at the bottom of the stairs on my way out' He back away still pointing the light my way until he reaches the hallway. His light then clicks off and he runs out the house, clearly not stopping to leave me any ammo. I realise then that I am still being to kind to these people and that I should have taken it in the stairway when I had the chance. Now he has the advantage, he knows I'm there he knows I have only one exit from the house. No point in searching the rest of this house now, not with the sense that I'm being watched. I wait for a minute to try to listen for footsteps - but nothing. I pull out a smoke grenade and slowly creep down the stairs so I can see the exit of the house, I toss the grenade so it will land just outside and let the smoke fill out before I run, out the door way and take an immediate right. Boom! a shotgun blast clips me and I'm bleeding. Can't stop now to attach a bandage, need to escape, I keep running, avoiding a straight path as much as possible weaving my way through gardens and round fences to avoid the killer behind me. I can hear the footsteps running to where he last saw me. I find a collection of bins and boxes next to a house and crouch to hide. I hear him come closer. He stops moving... tense again. I quickly apply a bandage and wait. Nothing, silence. He knows I've stopped and he is waiting for me to make the first move. I pull out my newly crafted pipe bomb and make a quick judgement on where I think he's stopped based on where I last heard him. I throw it. He realises what's happening and starts to run..., BOOM! Silence again, nothing, no sound. I wait for what feels like ages. I have to start moving now as I can't sit here all night. I equip my shotgun and approach his last know location. He's dead - I can see his prone body in the dark. I run up to it to search it for loot and BINGO! 1911 ammo :)\n\nThese are the types of scenarios that occur in this game everytime I play it, Sometimes I'm on the receiving end and lose all my loot that I have gathered for the past 30 - 40 mins but I know its give and take. Plus I should have done something different to avoid the death in the first place :)\n\nThere is alot yet to improve on in this game but they are making progress. Remember its early access, alot of the reviews write it off without having this in mind.\n\nWell worth the price tag!\n","January 11","true","198.3"," 106 of 123 people (86%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","86","106","123","23","6"

Also no EA game out right now has as much polish and optimization!\n\nHello my name is MrDocCutty im a simple trader who is friendly unless provoked!\nToday something incredible happend that changed my life! i was looting in the barracks of the military base when i heard a voice shout "THROW DOWN YOUR WEAPONS AND COME OUT WITH YOUR HANDS UP!"I thought to myself ???There isnt any animation or key bind for that action yet! But i quickly responded, "Oh Oh ok im just a simple trader i mean no one any harm sir." they shouted back "WE DONT GIVE A ♥♥♥♥! THROW DOWN YOUR PISTOL AND COME OUT BACKWARDS SLOWLY OR WE WILL SHOOT! Now im worried because i roll play a very kind friendly trader who helps newbies with food loot and gear! what i did next had to be done! I quickly ran upstairs because i know this game very well, i knew the upstairs windows are opened half way and it will be a great vantage point! So i get into 3rd person and i look around and i spot two men in the bushes outside the door with an asualt rifle and a shotgun and the third man by the stairs with a 22 rifle! i yell back to them, "OK..Im going to come out but please dont kill me ill do as you wish! They laugh openly and say "Good now hurry it up!" little did they know i had my pistol aimed at them so i took my shot killing the first guy in the bush with a head shot! he fell down dead the other two started to fire random shots into the building so i took out the second man with a head shot ! the third man wanted to end me pretty quickly so he ran upstairs to find me but a sniper never stays in that position once he fires so i went into the other room to hide! he is looking around and i quickly run downstairs to loot the two dead bodies and i get shot at ! i only have time to take his rugged pack and i start to head for the ocean knowing its a great place to hide! he must have wasted 45 bullets trying to hit me but my quick thinking and zig zag motions proved to save my life ! fast forward one hour and thirty mins that man went and got 11 other players to begin hunting me down openly in chat they were taunting me as i was trying to let them know i did what i had to to survive they started calling me wayne gracie the serial killer which offended me beacause i am a simple trader!So i took it upon myself to hunt each one down till all 11 were dead! Mind you all i had was two clips of pistol ammo and two boxes of shotgun ammo and my food was running out! Long story longer i ended up killing seven men in the office buildings they werent to smart being in one main room talking over mic then i took out the man who mugged me and since then for the last three days on that server they hunt me because one man took out 11 !

Plenty to explore on a large-scale map with a number of civilization "hotspots" being a few medium sized towns to loot, with smaller hamlets, structures or camps spread throughout.\nGameplay is dynamic in the sense that you must look to find items hiding within the game world in order to take them (sometimes well hidden, or blending in with the look of the surround area) and not simply point at a bunch of cupboards and click to 'search'.\nBasebuilding is similar in that there is (currently) no Snap-Too function, moving your character and your camera angles around you decide where to place different base parts freely, so long as the placeable template allows.\nNo Zombies - in keeping with the games background story; "Mutants" are your AI enemy, they are fast, they hit hard, but they're not indestructable if you own a gun - with ammunition.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\nThe server issues are definitely a pain, the Devs are working on various networking issues both for in-game item synchronisation and connectivity. However meanwhile, expect there to be various times your unable to connect to your desired server.\n\nNo storage currently. Although this is definitely planned for the future, they intend to stabilise the network before implementing this. Meaning your pockets and inventory slots are all you have to store items in, providing you don't exceed your carrying weight of 40Kg. There are rare cars throughout which can store items, if your able to obtain one and hide it.\n\nItem synch - as mentioned, there are some issues which can sometimes cause your loot to despawn should you attempt to drop it out of your bags temporarily, or pass it to another player.\n\n\nPositives:\n\nThe game looks and feels beautiful, with even further plans to update the realistic graphics on the next game engine's update.\n\nThe Devs are active, and open about their progress. Roughly each month they have an hour long stream or so revealing planned updates and explanations on progress thus far.\n\nThere is a background story, not much has been disclosed but there is evidence around, messages left, and the general feeling of what went on starts to build. This definitely makes the game feel it has more depth, and helps the world come alive.\n\nJust generally the game is good fun. Mutants pose enough of a threat to be a cause for concern, PvP'ers the same when entering larger towns. Loot isn't too scarce depending on whether somebody's looted your area recently. There's a variety of clothes, melee weapons and guns to gear up. Crafting recipes are "learnable" if you can find them, and you don't lose any new guides you've learnt by dying.\n\n\nSummary:\n\nI definitely would recommend this game to people who enjoy a similar genre. It seems this game is still slightly under the radar, but easily has the potential and direction of becoming a serious contender - both with gameplay and looks.\n\nP.S:  This is the first i've reviewed a game, so I hope it was helpful.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/recommended/299740/","DeliveryGodNoah","DeliveryGodNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/","363 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDISCLAIMER: This is all first impressions. I realize the game came out in Early Access on Steam only a couple days ago. I will edit my "review" accordingly as updates inevitably come out.\n\nObviously heavily inspired by many survival games like it, Miscreated takes the current trend of Early Access multiplayer titles and makes sure to impress with what it can do with so little.\n\nFirst off, I don't care if it really isn't relevant, but the main menu music I absolutely love. Sad, but slightly haunting. It's a great track.\nYou probably know by now, this was made with the Cryengine, an amazing engine capable of gorgeous, but still well optimized visuals. This definetely has the key visuals of a game made with the Cryengine. Beautiful water effects and high res textures, pleasant lighting, and reflections. EVERYTHING has reflections. Water, puddles, oil leaks, oil barrels, picture frames, shower tiles. While they might not be very obvious, if you really pay attention, the detail is there. It's not very practical in any real way, but it looks nice most of the time.\n\nThis game immedietly packs a few weather effects, such as rain, clear skies, and heavy fog. It needs tweaking to look truly gorgeous.\nAlmost every building currently in the game is enterable, even this early in development. Most of them also are fully furnished, but a bit copy and paste. They get the job done for now, especially since the loot system relies on hiding items in cupboards, fridges, tables, cabinets, etc.\nSpeaking of loot, from what I've seen it's lacking as I type. I've searched the entire map twice (entire map being all the points of interest, rather than every inch of forest) and found a hatchet, a hammer, and three 9mm pistols. (EDIT 1/16/2015: There has been a recent patch that has added numerous weapons to the loot table. This include a shotgun, a .357, a .22 rifle, and a  .223 rifle, as well as several different melee weapons.) Other than that there are several different kinds of soda, a few various kinds of canned food, some rad meds, and bandages. There are also stone, nails, wood, and other small things to use in a vague crafting system. Finally, there are small various bits of clothing.\nYour loot may vary though. I'm not fully aware of how loot is spawned, or if it is based on how many players are in the server. Perhaps some more playtime will clear that up, but as of right now playing on a server of about 15 people for a few hours, I found very little of use other than food.\n\nCombat is basic, but functional. The pistol I found fires, but there's little impact or satisfaction from doing so. Melee weapons are a bit floaty as well. Combat isn't very inspiring, but it is functional.\nI emptied a full 10 bullet clip into my partner however for testing, and despite most shots seeming to hit his head, he didn't die. Either it was just buggy at that point, or the pistol is underpowered.\n\nPlayer interaction this early on is to be expected. I've come across mostly unequipped, cautious players just trying to get a feel for their surroundings in this new game. I only encountered one hostile player, who saw me in a house, 100% unarmed, motionless, and began to whack me with a hammer at which point I shortly died.\nPersonally, I rarely attack anyone, especially if they aren't obviously equipped. Last night while playing I ran into 5 players, none of which had any equipment, and one of them even followed my small group for awhile.\nAs for other enemies, there are very, very few scattered zombie like enemies. They aren't very threatening this early on, and mainly seem to serve as place holders. Their AI is weak, and there's only the one enemy at this point. I was able to outrun one and enter a house, at which point the zombie freaked out, ran around the entire house once, tried the door again, and then ran off nowhere to be found again.\n\nAs for content in general, there isn't that much. What it does have is much more promising than most other survival games I've seen. It has some decent bones. Only time will tell if the game will really unlock its full potential.\nMy suggestion, as well as many others, wait a few patches. Let them add more weapons, enemies, and bug fixes.\nThere are NO rebindable keys in game, which is stupid for any game on PC. Some of the default keybinds don't even make much sense.\nYou can't drown as far as I can tell. My partner and I decided to jump from a small bridge into the ocean for fun, at which point my partner exclaims in fear that he saw another person just floating in the water that wasn't me. Turns out it was a guy, just creepily chilling under the water for who knows how long.\n$25 just seems like just over the line for the value this game offers right now. It's not too outrageously priced, but you can buy other survival games with more content for equal or cheaper. Overall, I give this game a thumbs up, but only because it shows a lot of promise. It certainly needs work, and that's to be expected.\n\nPC performance:\nIt's alright. Again, it's a Cryengine game, which usually always perform well. It's very CPU intensive though. My aftermarket CPU fan really kicks on with this game, so much that I can slightly hear it through my headset.\nThere are a few framerate drops in towns, and even a few random ones that don't seem to make too much sense. I'm running an overclocked 780ti and overclocked AMD 8350 with 16 GB of RAM, and I get about 45-60 FPS in towns, and it dips all over the place when you spin the camera around.\nSometimes I'll randomly get drops to 30 FPS for ten seconds and then it will go back up above 60. Hopefully optimization is high up on the list of things to work on. No point in even trying the game if it runs terrible.\nEDIT 11/2/2014: They used puns in their patch notes. Best developer ever.

So, I will list some current pros and cons!\nLet's start with the pros!\n---Pros---\n~Frequent updates!\n~New content added often (some content-vehicles-were added faster than it took to add them in DayZ!)\n~Amazing graphics! (OFC, Cryengine)\n~Fluid animations.\n~Smooth gameplay mechanics.\n~The mutants (NPC enemies) are actually a pretty big threat, unlike in DayZ, and they look sick!\n~Map is pretty big (not HUGE, but big)\n~Lots of gear (cosmetics, weapons, etc)\n~The devs actually CARE and LISTEN (unlike DayZ, once again)\n~I haven't encountered a single hacker, and neither have any of my friends who play.\n~Server sync! If you have gear on one server, it transfers to all other servers!\n\n---Cons---\n~Performance. It runs fine (medium-low) on a mid range PC, but if you wanna max it out you'll need a pretty nice PC. (I max it out on a GTX 780 SC paired with an i7 4790k, also OC'd. I get a consistent 60 fps on ultra with SMAA, only an occasional drop to around 55 fps when entering a large area.\n~Lack of players. However, I have seen an increase players recently.\n~Price. In my opinion, it is worth $25. However, there are some performance issues for lower end PCs and the lack of players might veer you away for that price.\n~SOME lack of content. Crafting is a bit weird and you can't craft much ATM, but that's okay with me.\n---------------------\n\nAll in all, I would recommend this game. It has a lot more going for it than against it, in my opinion. I think it deserves more credit than DayZ for sure, because the devs here CARE, LISTEN, and ACTUALLY WORK towards a finished product.","March 30, 2015","true","10.0"," 67 of 77 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","67","77","7","0"

Its basically DayZ with mutants of different kinds instead of zombies, and theres base building. Its not quite as far in development right now as DayZ, nor is the map nearly as big yet. (The devs have promised that more map area is coming.) However, the setting is very well thought out, with plenty of overgrowth and decay, as one should expect in a world decades after WW3 has left the Earth devastated by nuclear war. And best of all, it takes place in the good ol' USA, so all the signs are in ENGLISH! (Yay!)\n\nWith the recent AI update, the mutants have become a lot smarter, more animated, and more threatening. This is GOOD for anyone who is up for some challenging PvE action. The hope is that the more threatening mutant encounters will clear out some of the ever present and abundant KoS bandits (present in any and all games of this type) by encouraging a more PvE friendly atmosphere which requires some teamwork.","April 4","true","103.1"," 104 of 133 people (78%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","78","104","133","7","4"

This game is one of the best survival games I have played! Miscreated makes you really feel that you are surviving. The environment is really breathtaking! The reason why i said this game makes you feel like your suriving is that i was in a farming vehicle(which it has a pully on the back of it, so i hope they may implement something you can pull another vehicle or trailer) and i was driving in the road while my cousin was gathering things from the houses. To me that feels like suviving and working together which gives you the survival feel! Dayz, Rust, and Ark  will not compare to this game because for the simple fact that i found a game that wont have c4 or rocket launchers in it!

Anyone alive in 2089 that isn't mutated yet is just focused on staying that way."\n\nMiscreated is a gripping survival horror game (heavy emphasis on survival, moderate emphasis on horror) that offers a satisfying experience if played co-op, but offers a somewhat slow and tedious struggle if played alone.\n\nThe premise of the game is like any other in the genre: you're thrust upon a lawless land, forced to scavenge for yourself and build a base to protect not only your life but all the loot you've amassed on your travels through the map; fail to do that and, well, in the words of Cloud Atlas: "The weak are meat the strong will eat."\n\nUnfortunately, this is where the game shows that is more co-op friendly instead of a casual survivor sim like The Forest. Scavenging loot, gear, and weapons are easy enough, but when it comes to actually locking down a place to build and craft a fort, things become a bit more arduous and annoying. You will spend some time trying to find a decent area to build (and these would be around the main town or the military base) due to the distance restriction on placing plot signs (200m away from one another). I forgot to mention, however, that you'll be spending a LOT more time crafting your base components. Foundation by foundation, small tiny wall piece by tiny wall piece, you will painstakingly craft a base in an hour, what would have only taken you about 15 minutes in a solo session of Rust. This is because: you can't close the inventory window while crafting (so running around while your player crafts passively in the background is a no-go), and harvesting resources + crafting base components is time consuming. You will constantly be going from your base point to your resource point due to item weight, and only being able to carry about 1-1.5 building items at a time (so you can only craft 1 foundation and get maybe a quarter to half of the parts for another foundation piece before you are forced to run back to base to place your wall/foundation/door before you can harvest anymore resources) means you will spend a third of your base building time traveling. If you're doing this without a vehicle, it can get pretty old. Which leads me to the fact that...\n\nIt's a daunting task building a base in this game as a solo player. Usually after something requiring such effort, there's a sense of satisfaction or reward. However, I felt more annoyed than anything. Placing 2 Foundations, 8 walls, 2 more foundations for roofing, a door and 2 mini-walls for a door frame (there is no doorframe blueprint yet, or I've not found it if there is) took me quite a long time. Compound this with the fact that there is no chest available to you + items despawn when thrown on the ground in your base, you can't really help but feel that base building is just completely pointless.\n\nWith vehicles, getting them to run is just as tasking. There are numerous carparts required, many of which are high in weight so carrying only 1 or 2 primary items at a time is possible. This is understandable, but as a solo player this can mean taking a good hour or so finding everything required just to get a vehicle up and running. All the while, you have to make sure another player doesn't come along and snipe you, the car your working on, or the parts you've placed inside it. You can start to see why playing this solo can be cumbersome and stressful. The game even says it in grafitti on walls throughout the world: "Live in groups or die alone!\nCombine the time consumption of base building + difficulty of vehicle repair + weapon penetration (your base walls/doors/roofs/foundations can be shot through with very low damage mitigation) and it all equates to a very brutal solo playing experience. However, playing it with a group of people is very rewarding and much more enjoyable. Guarding a build site while your friends are harvesting and crafting, going on scouting missions for vehicle parts while someone is protecting the vehicle, Recon'ing in Pinecrest spotting enemy survivors to kill for loot...group play opens up a very tangible and immersive survival experience not found in single player.\n\nIf you are into base building but don't have a group to play with, this game will offer you what you seek but will take a bit more effort and may cause some spastic anger outbursts when you die, lose your hatchet, and end up searching an hour again for another one. You can definitely have fun with finding other survivors to kill, but for long term playability, a group is a must.\nOne of the better EA survival titles available with an active development team and growing community.. don't pass on Miscreated if you're a survival sandbox fan. It is worth every dollar of the early access price.","September 25, 2015","true","18.3"," 70 of 83 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","70","83","2","10"

Just don't listen to all of these fucboi's that write negative reviews after playing the game for less then 10 minutes crying about that there's no loot, They think the loot will glow in their eyes like it does in Infestation.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, yes it can still get a little bit buggy, but if you compare it to how it was back in the day to how it is now you'll see the huge improvements it had. there's so many more things to come to this game, I'll just throw a couple of examples: New Item system this will completely change the way the game works and add more features to the inventory system like Item stacking/splitting, reloading key "R", storage system, item duarbility, and much more, They'll also start adding predator animals into the game, and more animal variations because once the new item system is in the game that'll allow them to add hunting & cooking into the game.

But having played around with it for ~4 hours already, I can tell that this is definitely one of the more polished, immersive, and focused, "zombie" (mutants) survival games.\n\nGraphically, the game is unmatched in the world of Early Access survival games. The Crytek engine has always been able to make games look great, but it's the art direction this game has, specifically, that makes it stand out. Referring to something like H1Z1, you'll notice that the world in that game simply does not look like it's been hit by a zombie virus. The world is clean and has a very bland, uninspired art design. Miscreated, thankfully, understands that just because you're in EA doesn't mean you can't look great at the same time. Scavenging through buildings feels creepy (particularly at night), and the world is both bright and beautiful, but dreary and destroyed. I would actually say it's closest counterpart- at least visually, would be Fallout 4's art style.\n\nGameplay-wise, if you've played other zombie survival games, you'll have a general idea of what to expect here. You roam an open map, searching through buildings and rubble looking for supplies to stay healthy and armed to defend yourself. The scavenging in the game is very immersive, and thankfully avoids throwing menu after menu at you while playing. Looking at games like H1Z1 or 7 Days To Die, they both have "loot tables", meaning you'll spend most of your scavenging time clicking on containers, waiting a couple seconds, and then seeing what the game spawned in the menu that pops up. Miscreated actually loads all its items in as physical objects in the world, so you spend very, very little time looking at menus and loot tables, and instead spend your time feeling directly connected to the world looking for loot in half-opened cupboards or on shelves, etc.\n\nThe only real issue I have, gameplay-wise, with the game right now, is that combat feels just as clunky as any other survival game that I have played. Melee attacks feel light and it can be hard to tell when you've even hit an enemy at all. This is something I hope to see addressed very soon by the devs, as the overall polish that this game has feels counter to the fairly lackluster combat.\n\nBut, overall, this is an excellent "zombie" survival game that looks and plays great, and most importantly, is being very actively developed. A quick look at the update logs for this game will show you that at most, around every 3 weeks, the devs will drop a large content patch to the community with pretty significant improvements. This is what hurts so many survival games in general. It's what has killed my interest in games such as H1Z1, Project Zomboid, etc. An Early Access game that feels like it is constantly evolving for the better is a rare find on Steam, and I would suggest not letting Miscreated be an EA game to pass you by if the premise of an immersive, open-world, survival game, sounds right for you.","February 20","true","6.4"," 51 of 56 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","51","56","3","0"

I have played h1z1 for 335 hours and in comparison to Miscreated, h1z1 doesn't have a soul. This game does though. Stalker is my all time favourite game and this game is the closest to that of all the online persistent survival games out there. The enviroment is so god damn good looking and well made, so detailed. The guns feel autentic, not arcade like in h1z1. And when the freaking mindblowing base building enters the game soon, it will be gooood. Im only 4 hours in but i think that i am hooked. If you like serious games with deep atmosphere, if you like stalking and creeping on others - this game is for you.

Possibly the best survival being MADE. This game is really fabulous! EPIC BASEBUILDING, IMMERSIVE GAMEPLAY, EPIC SURVIVAL. Really much BETTER than DAYZ or H1Z1! CryEngine3 is AWESOME! Update monthly! Miscreated literally is the game I've waited for all my life.\n\nThe objective of this review is to help the players to know more about the game, and principally to help development team to improve the game, giving them a player feedback. Hope it helps the development team make the game the best that is possible!! Development team is doing a good work updating the game monthly with a lot of improvements. So I will keep updating this review according to the 2016 UPDATES.\n\nEngine: CRYENGINE 3 is a VERY good engine. Its not a heavy engine for the graphics it offers. Graphics are MUCH BETTER than H1Z1 or DayZ, and CRYENGINE is also lighter. But still need a lot of optimization. Inside the cities FPS falls down considerably. I run it on a HD5850 1GB/256bits at 1980x1080p on low with no AA, but very instable, while Crysis runs well, so it shows this game still need a lot of optimization. Now I'm trying 720p to get better fps using AA 1X TXAA.\nUPDATE 2016: On the last updates, performance of the game was improved considerably. Now the game is running a little bit smoothly than before, with less freeze. Developers please keep on working!\n\nDETAILS IN GAME: The intern environmment of the houses are good detailed. Better than other survivals. And you really need to search for the things inside the houses. On the floor, inside the cabinet, inside the drawer, over the refrigerator, on the table, on the chair, on the bed. You can easily pass through a item without seeing it if you are not payin atention. Realistic. Very cool.\nAlso the cenary outside looks pretty good,, forests, fields, and cities.\n\nMAP: a lot of houses, just 1 military base, some fuel stations, and some supermarkets and stores. but there arent hospitals, pharmacys, weapon stores, police stations, shopping centers, fireman stations, subway, train station, airport or seaport, bases and other places that exists in real world. Please add them to make the game more realistics. The map is still being developed, but at the moment the map is not big as DAYZ and H1Z1. For a good survival game the map must be really LARGE. Developers, please keep working on it.  Sound of enviroment also needs to be improved!\n\nMAX PLAYERS: Negative POINT is at the moment MAX PLAYERS per map are 36 PLAYERS ! So dont think you are gonna play like H1Z1 battle roayale with 150 players. Please DEVELOPERS work on it!\n\nCARS AND OTHERS: there are only 2 type of cars (car and truck). But could be more. Also IT WOULD BE REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING AMAZING if the developers added some elements used like in ARMA II DAYZ MOD...  PLEASE WE NEED Motorcycles, bicycle, helicopters, airplanes and others. ITS really important to game become fun and more realistic. Horses and bicycles CAN be an easy way to game dont become a walking simulator.\nUPDATE 2016: they are providing a new truck and bycicle, but both still being tested\n\nCRAFTING:  just Basebuilding!! There is no other usefull things to craft at the moment. Developers please work on this..\n\nMUTANTS: AI of mutants are sad !!! You just get up in a car and mutants stop chasing you. WTF man? lastwise they could be like the zombies in walking dead (Persistents). Please developers work on it. They dosnt hear sounds. the Most of the places there is no mutants. . Also please work on NEW TYPE of mutants ( cause there is only 1 at the moment), would be very cool if you could not predict what kind of mutant you are gonna find on your way (Left4Dead 2 has 4 different types, and this game was done in 2009). Sometimes it becomes boring very easily. You dont take frights with them. To improve it would be very cool find mutants locked inside rooms or houses, or a swarm of mutants suddenly in the forest or inside a building. You know, like in THE WALKING DEAD SERIES man. They should be attracted by noise, light, or smell of animal meat being roasted on a camp fire inside your base. It would be very cool if a swarm of mutants could attack your base due to these reasons, suddenly.\nTHE WAY IT IS AT THE MOMENT, mutants cause no fear and are not a risk for anyone. The deers in game escapes from the mutants, and they dont even need to run to escape.\nUPDATE: They are working on AI system of the game. Updates are coming..\n\nBASE BUILDING: EPIC BASEBUILDING. I HOPE THE DEVELOPERS KEEP WORKING HARD ON IT! Has a huge potential with the CRYENGINE... Its an important aspect of the new generation of  SURVIVAL GAMES. Please developers WORK HARD!! Check ARMA II DayZ mod, this game has a very interesting way of building bases. Please follow some elements.\n\nWEATHER: I think its not finished yet. But there is no rain or cold. But game already has temperature of the body, so I think they are gonna implement more weather conditions. Please work on it to game become more realistic. Snow, rain, sun, and elements that become game a real survival post apocalypict game!\n\n\nFIRST PERSON AIM: This is the worst part of the game. its strange to use. Graphics of the guns are not good yet, and should have aim on third person! Shoot does not seems realistic. It Seems robotic. Effects are pooor. Please DEVELOPERS WORK ON IT.\n\nHUNTING: WHY CANT I HUNT AND COOK THE MEAT?  I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS A REALISTIC HARDCORE SURVIVAL. I dont like to eat canned meat everyday man, and virtually this is the only thing you eat in game!! So would be interesting if i COULD FISH, HUNT DEERS OR OTHER ANIMALS, AND THEN COOK THE MEAT IN A CAMP FIRE. With salt we could dehydrate the meat to leat later. PICK FRUIT also would be cool.\n\nEFFECTS: THE GAME COULD HAVE SOME EFFECTS LIKE THE MOVEMENT OF DRINKING WATER OF EATING FOOD OR USING A BANDAGE ON A INJURY. DayZ has this effects, are very cool and the game become more realistic\n\nBUGS: SOME CRASHS and  CANT DISABLE ANTI-ANALISING !\n\n\nThis game still need a LOT of improvements. But even so I can say it is a good EARLY ACCESS game. I appreciated good times playing this game, had a lot of fun trying to kill other people, surviving and building my base. So I recommend it. 10/10 ITS A MUST HAVE IF YOU LIKE SURVIVAL EXPERIENCES. But dont forget it is an EARLY ACCESS, the game is still being developed.","January 24","true","252.4"," 87 of 114 people (76%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","76","87","114","15","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/meckus/recommended/299740/","meckus","Meckus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/meckus/","373 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nRecently I've been playing a few "apocalypse" games that just happen to have a survival components in them. Needless to say, Miscreated is one of those games, and it delivers a whole new take on the genre. You'll face other players fighting to survive, you'll face mother-nature, but in the end, your worst nightmare will be the mutants.\n\nNo one can tell what goes on in between the person you were and the person you become. No one can chart that blue and lonely section of hell. There are no maps of the change. You just come out the other side.\nOr you don't.\n\n\nStephen King, 'The Stand'\n\nWithout any further delay, I present to you my review of Miscreated.\n\nGameplayYou start as a fresh spawn, whose first obvious objective is to find some food, some drinks, and possibly some weapons. From there on, your main objective will be to stay away from the mutants, unless you're some sort of daredevil, as they are ruthless and will stop at nothing to kill you. During your adventures, you'll encounter other players, and while some might be nice, others will certainly prefer to see you dead, just like the mutants. But don't worry, karma is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\nTo make life easier, and also to allow you to explore the vastness of Miscreated's beautiful and well-designed map, you'll eventually find some vehicles. However, there's a catch, you'll need to make sure those vehicles have the required parts to work, such as wheels, spark plugs, oil, et cetera. Once you're able to gather all of the parts, and put them together, you'll have a wonderful time enjoying the amazing scenery. Until you get killed. Or die of starvation. Either way, you'll die. Everyone always does. But you can certainly enjoy yourself scavenging and hunting (friends and foes!).\n\nAnd don't forget, don't look behind you.\n\nPros Amazing graphics, the best I've seen around the genre thus far;\nCompelling sound effects, somewhat creepy too;\nRuns smoothly, and I'm yet to experience any kind of lag;\nThere's a status bar on the UI that tells you how you're doing, needs wise, although some could say it loses some realism due to it;\nMany items available;\nIf you exit the game, or even change server, you get to keep the items you had;\nQuite a few items available to customise your character's looks;\nIncredibly well designed environment, with the perfect amount of spookiness to it.\nConsidering it's an Early Access (EA) game, I've decided to add a "Neutral" category, for details I consider important, but not gamebreakers, and could easily improve the gameplay if attended.\n\nNeutral Can't assign different keybinds, unless you mess around with game files;\nThe character feels somewhat stiff, when the camera is set to 3rd person;\nCan't customise your character's build, or even be a female;\nThe mutants could use a makeover;\nWould benefit from an increased realism on certain matters, since carrying jerry cans and tires on your pants, or even backpack, doesn't feel very realistic.\nOnce again, considering its current EA state, I wouldn't be surprised to see the "Cons" I'll list below fixed or improved in the upcoming updates.\n\nCons Takes quite a while to load up the "worlds"/servers;\nDespite being able to explore freely, the game lacks the ability to be able to interact with most objects.\nQuite a few visual glitches, mostly weed growing where it shouldn't and items sort of floating;\nFew audio/video settings.\nVerdictI'd give it a 8/10 and I'm sure it will get better over time, not only due to its active development team, but also due to its already great state, I can only imagine how great it will be at the time of its full release.","May 1, 2015","true","11.9"," 79 of 103 people (77%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","77","79","103","6","19"

This game offered me something more than DayZ or H1Z1. DayZ is running simulator, you run across whole map, find some weapons, and get killed,  I am not suggesting it's not a good game, i have 400h in DayZ on my second account, but developers definetly need to add something new, like possibility of building, workshop, etc. H1Z1 - Honestly i expected more from this game. This game looks like simple FTP game, in which you can buy skins for clothes, or other things that will make you better than others. This game have nothing really to survival. Animations sucks, weapon models are worst i ever seen in any survival game, world is in 90% covered by forests, and graphics are also not that good. Miscreated - I didnt expected alot from this game, but this game suprised me. Graphics are amazing, its not simple running simulator in which you only get loot and get killed. Here in Miscreated you spawn, get your first weapon which is mostly G18, explore intresting world, and build a base. While walking on the Miscreated world im never bored, always something suprised me. Miscreated world looks amazing, this game just have its own unique atmosphere, every bullet is worth alot, sometimes worth more, than other players life.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat I do like in this game?\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n+ Unique atmosphere\n+ Weapon models\n+ Animations\n+ Sounds\n+ Locations\n+ Vechicles\n+ Melee/Ranged weapon types\n+ Graphics\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\nWhat I do not like\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n- Well in my opinion there should be more Military type of clothes in game.

Those games will be completed and stay in early access. Miscreated is and feels like an early, early, access game. I think with time, if the devs keep up the pace, Miscreated can become the top zombie survival game in the genre. DayZ looks like it's on it's way out and H1Z1 is by Daybreak Games, which means their team will be working hard on EverQuestNext and not have the time to fix or finish H1Z1. Daybreak Games has already slowed/ stopped working on Landmark and it's still in Early Access. This is where Miscreated has a chance to step in and steal the spotlight. If the patches stay regular and the devs communicate with the playerbase like they have been, this will be the one and only zombie survival game.","August 10, 2015","true","24.6"," 79 of 105 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","79","105","4","0"

From the recent reviews I can at least assume it's a smallish amount of the playerbase that has this problem.

Yes.\nDoes it have good graphics at a fairly stable frame rate? Yes.\n\nIt's competition for other survival games, and a decent one at that.\n\nThe big problem is it's seemingly unplayable for a very high percent of people. Unfortunately many, many folks are unable to connect to any servers, and this is a known problem. From last December, something which means you cannot play it, you cannot even bug-test (after all this is early access, you pay to help test it, etc)\n\nStaff and Developers were on it for a good while, the forum thread in which they go through this problem has been updated for about 4 months, then it went dead, completly. People are still posting on it (Last post was about 2 months ago), yet there has been no responses at all from Devs, apart from "We've fixed X amount of Y, X amount of Z, and X amount of Q, without really detailing how, and giving no more response.\n\nSo while it has promise, I can't recommend something that is literally broken for so many people.","November 19, 2015","false","6.8"," 190 of 284 people (67%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","67","190","284","17","21"

Do NOT base your opinion on older reviews. Things have gotten much MUCH better. When in doubt, I encourage you to find a streamer that's playing it on Twitch and ask some questions while checking out some gameplay. You'll probably run into some of the Devs too. Educate yourself.\n\nThe environmental decorations and details are incredibly immersive. They never cease to impress me each time I play. Every location and house has it's own feel. Almost like it can tell it's own story of what happened after the apocalypse. Stunning. The game is absolutely beautiful.\n\nUpdates come on the average of 2-3 weeks. the map keeps expanding with new areas every month or two. Servers are INCREDIBLY stable at this time. Rarely ever going down except for update patches. Day/Night cycle is lengthy, but not TOO lengthy. With excellent lighting during both. Turning the flashlight on at night while you're looting is often more frightening than being in the dark. Sometimes you don't want to know what's in the dark and your mind plays tricks on you. And the new weather eefects added are simply stunning. Even for first pass implementation. The thunder storms and rain.... OMG.\n\nThe inventory weight sytem is engaging and inherently encourages teamwork over KOS to get larger tasks done. (Such as fixing vehicles up to drive and the soon to be implemented base building). Sure you can lone-wolf it. But don't expect to hold down a location or have a fleet of vehicles alone. As in real life, I can not and would not like to carry around a car battery, fuel, building supplies, 4 tires with a backpack, food, survival tools and weapons. Often I find myself hiding my backpack somewhere so I can carry fuel or tires back to a vehicle that myself and friends are putting together. I absolutely love this mechanic system and can't wait for it to be fleshed out more and more. (Getting the needed materials to get the generator running at the Old Mine or Airbase and turning on the flood lights at night it a feeling i'll not soon get over. Very, VERY cool.)\n\nThe combat stances is also a mechanic that I simply love the idea of. And it has been implemented very well so far. When your weapon is stowed away on your back or holster, you move at full speed. Drawing your weapon provides you with 2 stances. "At the Ready" and "At Ease". In the "At Ease" position, your weapon is lowered, a slightly neutral posture. This posture keeps the right click button free for zooming and focusing on distant objectives and does not attack with a single click. It also lowers your movement speed slightly to compensate for the way your body would move while holding your weapons in your hands. When you switch to the "Ready" stance, your weapon is raised and ready for combat. Right click then becomes an Aim Down Sights function and your movement speed is further decreased for the sake of aim and accuracy. (Try aiming down the sight of a shotgun or rifle in real life, hold it to your cheek and tell me how fast you can run reliably or comfortably. Hehe) Switching these stances is simple and quick, and the movement speeds for each just add another small touch that I appreciate and enjoy with my immersion.\n\nCrafting continues to expand. With base building being in and a team effort. Completely enjoyable. Future updates will implement a new item system to the core including gun crafting, customization and storage containers will make their appearance. (This seems to be a huge complaint from negative Nancys that storage boxes are not in yet. They're coming.) This however does not effect my enjoyment. I don't need to hoard supplies personally.\n\nThe AI system has recently gone thru changes. A third party AI has seen its first pass implementations and is quite basic atm. Relying on simple sight and sound and chase functions. Seeing that it is the same third party AI used in games such as Dying Light, I'm the future of this AI will be excelent. But being actively in development, this is not something that I can mark as a negative impact. Even if it bugs out or despawns mobs occassionally. I've always seen posative progress in this games development. And this is another area that I look forward to it's expansion in the future.\n\nThe Development team is EXTREMELY involved in the community (especially the streaming community) and the passion they have for their product is something I have rarely seen.\n\nDoes it still have a ways to go? Yes. Does it have Alpha bugs? Ofcourse. But the road it has taken and the roads it is heading to have made me very happy to have backed this project in Early Access.\n\nIn a genre that is flooded and yet somehow not allowed to be expanded on by extremist fanboys, this PvEvP survival game shines like a gem in my eyes.\n\nWell worth the price of admission. I'm looking forward to the future, even if it is filled with mutants that want to feast on my flesh! ;)\n\nGame on!","June 2, 2015","true","129.3"," 58 of 74 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","58","74","5","3"

A fast paced survival (but mostly shooter game)? The game version of Hoarders? A better DayZ / H1Z1?\n\nWell fortunately it is none of the above but rather much more. Just like described this is a hardcore survival game, not a shooter, not a survival-but-you-find-guns-in-every-corner-game, not game where you loot a bunch of ♥♥♥♥ just to hide it in a base in the middle of the hills so you can brag about it. It is exactly what is advertises: one very tough game, but even more enjoyable.\n\nAlright let me start of with the visual aspect of the game which, in my opinion, is stunning. Thank the lords for Cry-Engine and also the Devs for a great work on those textures, especially the foliage that looks amazing and allows one to hide in it very easily. Sunrises look amazing, and at night the game looks impressively scary (probably the reason why so many people -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥- play on 24h Daylight servers).\n\nMoving on to the PVP/combat aspect of the game, over which I've seen a lot of complaints on the forums: I personally think the combat system is fine, of course it wasn't easy to get used to but I feel that's exactly the point: it's supposed to be difficult. At the end of the day it is a different experience and very enjoyable once you get used to it. No you can't run and gun, but if that's all you expect from this game, shooting ♥♥♥♥ at a fast pace, you might as well go back to Cowa Doody 47: Black ♥♥♥♥♥. Of course there are flaws to it, but if one can't deal with flaws one shouldn't ♥♥♥♥ing buy Pre-Access games.\n\nWhen it comes to amount of loot and vehicles I've also seen plenty of people complain, especially lack of guns. This is a complaint made mostly by people who just started since they don't know ♥♥♥♥. Loot is pretty much everywhere and so are guns you just need to know the right places, and it will only take you a few hours to start understanding where the best places to loot are. Vehicles are also pretty common, once you know where to look, although not common enough for them to be easy to find.\n\nOverall with about 40hrs played in this game I've had a lot of fun, not only by just killing people but also by speaking and collaborating with them, of course I've been KOS plenty of times, but it's part of the game and can be avoided. There are still plenty of flaws in the game, for me the main one would be base building, since collecting wood pile and turning it into lumber and other parts is a pain, which I haven't really gotten into. I think the lack of storage that makes everyone complain is something that should be added, although it is not something I find essential since not having storage makes you appreciate more each life, making you question your actions, which leads to an even harder game.\n\n\nWriting this review after a patch that brought plenty of bugs into the game I still believe there is A LOT of potential, but as a community I think we should also understand that making games isn't easy and takes time, especially with a small team.\n\nI wish the Dev team good luck and will be updating this review later on. Also in-case you didn't understand I definitely recommend this game.\n","March 26","true","94.2"," 66 of 88 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","66","88","7","1"

I found myself in an abandoned town, a motorcycle helmet on my head and a wasteland .22 slung on my back.

Sadly, I had not found any by the time I needed to log out, so finding a nook to log out, and not knowing whether I actually needed to hide before logging out, I logged out.\n\nEarly access being what it is, I enjoyed the game in its current state, no bugs were noted and game play was smooth - very promising I think and will only be more enjoyable when you are trying to find that elusive ♥♥♥♥ing fuel while your mate guards the pickup truck from other people with the same ideas as you....","May 14, 2015","true","7.9"," 70 of 96 people (73%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","73","70","96","12","5"

They let me join them. Right after we were attacked by a small group of zombies/mutants. During the confusion of us all running around we realized that one of the three guys I was with had been killed. For some reason, they assumed I did it, even though I didn't. One of the guys opened fire on me. I quickly killed him with my shotgun. I spoke to the third and last guy... warning him that I had no intention to harm anyone. He backed away into the woods. The thrill I felt as I quietly walked away from the screwed up situation alive... is amazing.\n\n**  Yesterday a friend and myself were hunted by two guys on a four wheeler who had a ton of weapons. They killed my friend. I managed to chase one off and have no idea what happened to the other one. Somehow I've never been killed by anyone. Yet I've seen several people die on this game. Why am I still here?\n\nThis game is just beautiful. It looks great. The environments are awesome. Basebuilding has been implemented, but I believe the crate system has not been finished yet.\n\nMy only complaint at this point are the mutant zombies. I just do not like the way they look.

(it's Dayz for the arcade set).\nWe are in an age of zombie chic, there's so many zombie/mutant titles right now and it depends on what you think of the genere and what you want out of it that will determine what you choose to play. This game undoubtedly has some nice visuals but some fairly lame character modelling.It's got lots of the right types of locations, but somehow they just dont feel.. real. I meet another player and my senses go into 'arcade mode' it doesn't really matter, I don't feel threatened and I don't really know why.\nAnd then there's the user base.. "hello?"............ no one home.\nThirty or forty players accross 20 or 30 servers? I really want to like this game and I genuinely hope it becomes a really good game that will grow a large player base. But I'm sorry, if you want realism, tension and lots more variety and customisation to your survival experience then head to Dayz. It's the daddy of the survival/zombie genere and I don't see it being bettered, possibly ever!\nWould I recommend it, I'm going to say yes, but only for the curiosity factor and for the casual survivor.

It went from being a bare minimum game, to what is in my opinion, the best survival game currently out. Unlike other games such as DayZ or H1Z1 which have practically no environment, Miscreated actually feels like the apocalypse. There have been times my group will go out just to explore the caves and land. That doesn't mean there aren't any flaws, combat can feel clunky at times and there is currently no storage to put inside your base, leading to vehicles being hoarded for storage. You start with basic structures to aid you in building, going out and looking for building guides will greatly help as it adds new structures for you to build with. This adds a bit of an end game feel as the guides are quite rare. I went from playing H1Z1 non stop (around 1600+ hours) to buying Miscreated and I haven't played H1Z1 since. Most negative reviews for the game are extremely old, the devs are always pushing updates and letting the community know about what is to come in the future.","November 19, 2015","true","420.8"," 54 of 71 people (76%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","76","54","71","3","0"

I watched a developer stream featuring it and asked some questions to which were answered, i'd bought a copy before I left that stream and haven't looked back. The graphics are better, the server stability is very good even on the high ping servers they still run smooth. The personal touch by the developers in this game is truly amazing, there is nearly always one of the developers themselves or people close to them watching the streams of Miscreated. They are a small team spread all across the world and the game they have made will be huge. Base building soon to be added and Battle Royale planned for the future. I cannot recommend this game enough to people at the price its at this game is absolute bargain. Best £14 i've ever spent, I been playing it for a couple of months now and already passed 250 hours.

It's clear, in retrospect, that the devs, of which this is a small, sorta rag-tag bunch (not trying to disparage them, it's just that they are a small team that works remotely) released this game way before they should have.  The network issues were so bad at launch that they completely overwhelmed content and art development and are STILL being worked on nearly two months later.\n\nIt is what it is.  I hope to come back to this game in 6 months or even a year and really enjoy it, but right now the servers are dead, there has been zero new gameplay added since launch outside of a few items, and the immediate roadmap is still stuck on "fix the networking issues".\n\nI still recommend the game, but at this point, I'd also recommend holding off if you haven't purchased and checking back this summer.\n\nThe good:\n\ngraphics (cryengine 3, 'nuff said, textures could use some work but not bad for pre-alpha)\n\ncombat (for an early alpha hand to hand is pretty fun, hit boxes need som adjusting though)\n\natmosphere (sounds are good for pre alpha and so is the map)\n\nthe bad:\n\nbad lag at times that impacts gameplay (rubber banding, teleporting)\n\ngameplay (dynamic loot spawn needs a lot of work.  there just isn't much around and there are so many times you think something is loot (say a metal bar to use as a weapon) and instead it's just nothing.  There is literally nothing to do other than gather loot but in my 4 hours (on a 20 pop server) all I found was a hammer, a couple beanies, some ammo and some food.  Apparently there was a bug last night that was spawning guns under stuff so they couldn't be seen)\n\nlack of voice chat (they are working on it, and it might even be in by the time I post this, but as of last night it wasn't working).\n\nSummary:\n\nThis game is over priced at $25 for a pre-alpha.  Seems more a tech demo than anything but the basic mechanics are there and it just needs a lot of content and bug fixing to make it worth $25.\n\nThat said, I bought it fully knowing all that and I don't regret it.  This game has a lot of potential and the devs seem committed to seeing it through.  If you like games in this style I'd recommend waiting but if you don't mind overpaying a bit and a lack of real content (pretty much my attitude) then go ahead, pick it up.","November 3, 2014","true","13.9"," 56 of 76 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","56","76","0","3"

Not so long I can go and maybe eat something, but long enough that I can get through a youtube video or two.\n-It takes FOREVER to join a server, and I know thats not my internet, because I switched providers recently and it didnt change.\n-Sometimes, after waiting ten minutes to join a game, it just kicks me back to the main menu.\n-When im playing, sometimes, the game will just randomly freeze as if its crashed, but ti hasnt. It will sit there, sound playing normally and such, and then come back to life (My guess is its loading something? However. the above problems mentioned might be my fault, as I cant find anyone else having them online in my searches)\n-The "zombies" or creatures that you put in never move. They often just spawn inside of each other and sit there.\n\nBut, I will say this...\nWhen the game does function, its fun. Not everyone is out to kill you like DayZ, and the weapons have very good models and sound. The lack of reload animations I actually like, even if it is just a placeholder, have to drag my magazines in and out feels nice. The combat is fast paced and satisfying unlike DayZ, and ammo isnt too hard to find aswell as guns. The atmosphere and graphics and alot better than DayZ AND is much more optimized than DayZ.\n\nIf you want some constructive criticism:\n-Dont switch to third person, stay first person, for the love of god STAY first person/third person\n-Reduce jump height. Its very annoying how some players bunnyhop around when in gunfights (Which is, in my opinion, the only flaw in combat)\n-Add more variety of weapons (I assumed this was a given, or is already being implemented\n-Refine the ingame UI a little bit. It looks a bit cheap and quickly designed, but it does work. Just needs a bit of tuning.\n\nMy Specs:\nCPU: AMD-FX 6-Core Vishera processor clocked at 3.5ghz\nGPU: ASUS ATI-R9270 2GB VRAM with 1100Mhz clock speed\nRAM: 8GB\nHDD: 2x Seagate Barracuda 1TB HDD\n\nIn conclusion, do I recomend this as an alternative to DayZ? Yes. Frequent updates, lower price, less bug/glitches, better combat and more stable mechanics, aswell as better graphics and better optimization, I would say so.\n\n","August 6, 2015","true","7.6"," 36 of 44 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","36","44","0","0"

Everything goes to finding some loot like clothes, food, drinks, a gun (9mm pistol), few melee weapons, killing other players which are mostly not friendly and that's it. Not fun enough to keep you playing it for a long time.\nThe servers are really bad as you spent most of an ingame time trying to connect to any and they are restarted all the time so when you finally connect to some server you play it for some time (i think the best result was playing for 1 hour without getting disconnected) and then it goes down and you keep trying to connect once more.\nIt all can ♥♥♥♥ people off pretty much.\n\nDevelopment: Due to the fact that the team consists of guys working remotely from all around the world the development is quite slow. Only this month they made it full-time project for everyone involved. Still no new patch though. Everything is being promised only.\n\nVerdict: I would not recommend this game to those gamers who wants to play a readymade game. But for those who like to see some game growing and evolving and being some kind part of it - it will do.\n\nAs for me, I liked the game and I had some fun with my friends playing it finding bugs and different funny glitches.\n\nMany reviewers say this game's got some potential.

Despite giving it a 6.5/10 in it's current state, I would still recommend buying it if you are interested in early access games and can understand that the game IS broken and is not a polished AAA title.\n\nREVIEW:\n\nThis game is off to a good start so far, but is obviously lacking content as it is in a pre-alpha stage.\n\nInitially, I bought this game through the conbined persuasion of a friend and of the beautiful map it produces running on the CryEngine 3.\n\nIt took some time, but after a half an hour or so of wandering the beautiful map, I managed to find food, a gun, ammo, and some clothing. Setting myself up for my journey to meet with my friend. Along the way, we encountered unfriendly players (who we killed), Bambi's (literal deer. not freshies [We did meet freshies too, though]) and needle-armed mutants we've come to call Narwhals.\n\nIn my honest opinion, this game has a much better pre-alpha than DayZ Standalone did, and has just as much potential. In their current respective states, DayZ Standalone still wins, but I will continue to watch this game and I look foreward to observing it progress.","November 4, 2014","true","9.8"," 37 of 47 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","37","47","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/inthenameofbubbles/recommended/299740/","inthenameofbubbles","Bubbles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/inthenameofbubbles/","158 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI wrote a review in german, but as i'd like to address more people i'll change it to english :)\nCompared to other EAA Survival-Games, the "Mixed" Reviews for this game don't do the game justice at all. I try to break it down into Pros and Cons as it seems to give potential buyers the best overview.\n\nPros:\n\n- Awesome looking, well designed post-apocalyptic world, i've never seen any multiplayer game look this pretty. Cry Engine. End of story.\n- Very active devs. This game is as far from abandoned by the devs as it could be. They work fulltime on this game and release new content frequently without rushing things and releasing game-breaking stuff. Every patch gets hotfixed if there are big issues coming with it.\n- Best basebuilding system ever, because it's completely up to you how you place each object, nothing like basebuilding in Rust or H1Z1. In addition, you can find basebuilding guides around the world to increase your basebuilding"skills". Very motivating and rewarding, even though my opinion is that there should be some kind of crafting table where you get the chance to create a missing guide by using guides you found and already learned, cause you keep finding stuff you already know.\n- The community. Well, a couple of month ago I would have said sth. like "Best community ever". These days are gone unfortunaly. A lot of KoS and baseraiding-only players have come to this game, but I still met far more friendly and nice people than in other survival games. If you like to communicate with others, which doesn't mean you need to play with them for hours, just not plain KoS, this game is for you.\n- Story. Yes, I'm serious. This game has a short story which explains which year it is, why things turned out the way they are and why there are mutants around. Don't underestimate this, this is important to me, because the atmosphere benefits so much from it. For example: They just released a new, small town called "Clyde Hill". Clyde Hill was a refugee camp built by the company that is mainly responsible for the apocalypse after the break out. It's some kind of gated community, which has now been abandoned and been destroyed, too. Stuff like that's adds variety to the locations - I think it's awesome!\n\nCons:\n\n- Each patch changes the performance in some way, so you might have lower fps or some other problems after a patch. Never happened to me that an issue like that was gamebreaking though.\n- PVE is way too easy, which then leads into people trying to kill everyone they meat (KoS). The supplies and weapons are quite easy to find. I have spent about 500 hours in this game and I was never close of dying from starvation or thirst. The mutants are actually quite strong and they added a huge amount of them, so they are not the issue imo.\n\nOne thing that you should be aware of is that Miscreated is an EAA game and it is still in an early development status. The map is rather small atm and so is the variety of items. But IT IS a work in progress and it is so interesting and enjoyable to witness the game growing and evolving.

It also has a great Dev Team behind it that is constantly working on updates and working with the community. This shows that the game will soon be out of Alpha and on its way to the big leagues.\n\nI enjoy the rush from "interactions" with other players and this game is perfect for that. The newly added military base has brought tons of action to my nights of playing and It just makes the game that much better. The guns aren't all super accurate so it helps or destroys gunfights. Also makes it hard for me to just chill up on the mountain overwatching places and snipe random Bambis to be the evil man I am.\n\nWith the new VOIP added last patch as of today (2/05/15), It makes player interactions alot easier to see who is friendly and who is not, but this also adds to the game of getting large groups together and then slowly slaughtering them one by one and just blame it on "the guy in the mountains"\n\nAnyways,\nGameplay is fantastic if you are into the whole loot up and then have fun for a bit and maybe die a couple times in between.\n\nGraphics are decently well done, they have removed most of the grass from the CryEngine so the game will run alot smoother on most lower end pc's.\n\nThe sound quality is alright so far and I'm sure they have plans for improving it in the future. Ambient sounds can be a bit buggy. You can hear most people around you, and even scare yourself when you think you hear someone but you are really just crouched and turning to different positions(which makes walking noises)\n\nI almost forgot about the mutants, boy do I hate those things, but I haven't seen them much as I have been stuck to the Military Base, but those suckers are real game breakers when you have no loot + they chase deer.\n\nTheir is also some easter egg behind the game, because just below Factories/Woodhaven, there is a giant body(or the lower half of it) sticking out of rubble in a drainage pipe. So Mysteries would be 10/10.\n\nCan't wait for future updates as I love the game so far.\n\nThat is my review on Miscreated,\nThin","February 5, 2015","true","65.6"," 40 of 53 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","40","53","8","0"

The drill armed zombies I'm not really a fan of because they are extremely tough unless you have a gun and the way they look is just weird and there is no variety. However, these zombies do make it fun and add a sense of danger. Me and my friend grouped up and we were soon chased by 8 zombies we ran towards a bridge and jumped off into the water making a cinematic getaway lol. There are also a lack of items but enough for a game in early access, a bunch of clothing and melee weapons and 2 guns as well as numerous food and drinks. The only thing that they really need to fix is the optimization. I have a 3.5ghz processor and 6gb of RAM and 1gb of VRAM. That's enough to run the huge game of DayZ but I can only run this on low at 1366 by 768.

There are simply too many other better (read: functioning) early access titles out there.\n\nPros : Great graphics, pretty well designed map (though there is no compass or in-game map).  Atmosphere is great, until you realize...\n\nFar too little to do, and far too many frustrating bugs exist for me to give it a recommendation at this point.  That is, of course, if you can actually connect to the servers to see what the actual game looks like.  Many users simply cannot connect to game servers or experience constant crashes and freezes and are completely unable to get into the game world.\n\nIf you're not affected by these bugs and you can actually load in, you're mostly spending all your time building a base (that cannot store any items) or you are searching endlessly for loot.  If you happen to come across ultra rare items (assault rifle, sniper rifle, ammo for those weapons, guides) there is a very real possibility that your inventory will glitch out and those items will simply disappear after you log out or if the server resets.  There's just not much to do, and what little bit there is, is pretty unpolished and pretty buggy.  Food and water is extremely plentiful, so the only "survival" aspect of this game is surviving encounters with other players.\n\nThe only real "excitement" that comes after the novelty of searching endlessly for loot wears off, is in the player interactions....  Like all of these survival genre games, it basically boils down to\n\n1.  Shoot them (or get shot at)\n2.  Engage in parlay, team up (for no real purpose other than safety in numbers)\n3.  Run away\n\nThe mutants in the game, which make up the bulk of the PVE aspect, are pretty scarce and a joke if you have any competency whatsoever in a FPS.  Right now they seem to serve mainly as placeholders, and I sincerely hope that more is done with them so that there is a strong push for survivors to work together, rather than just make this another DayZ clone and its nothing but bandits and griefing.\n\nIf the inventory system can get sorted out, and storage is actually added... and some server stability.... This game has huge potential.   Add in NPCs, maybe questing, actual PVE type activities...Could be big.\n\nUnfortunately, fixes and updates are coming at a snail's pace and despite the improving interaction from the Developers the current bugs and slow progress is resulting in even less people playing (hardly any play as it is) and the very real possibility of the  game disappearing into limbo as so many other Early Access titles normally do.  Why on Earth would you release such a broken game, alpha stage or no, when all you've done is really hurt your public persona and shot yourself in the foot?   A lot of people are feeling burned by this and the incredibly slow progress to solving some of the most critical game bugs is not confidence boosting in any way, shape, or form.\n\nThe Developers have admitted to the multitude of problems and confirmed they are indeed trying to work on them, but as stated above, the pace at which things have been progressing is awful.  They have mentioned a total item re-work is coming, which in theory should solve a multitude of server side issues, including latency, stability, performance.\n\nSo in conclusion, this game has great potential and if the Devs can get their issues sorted out with this engine, this could be the next big thing in the survival genre.  However, as time keeps ticking with no tangible progress (from the user's perspective) I believe they are slowly (if they haven't already) losing their window of opportunity to really grab people's attention (and money).\n\nMy recommendation is to hold off until the new inventory system is implemented so that we can gauge how effective this new system is at solving a multitude of issues.\n\nTLDR\n-Game has potential (graphics, atmosphere, map, promised features)\n-A lot of game breaking bugs, glitches and otherwise missing features that really impact how functional and enjoyable the game is currently\n-Devs are working hard on the game, but progress have been slow\n-Playerbase is tiny and dwindling due to the aforementioned problems\n-Patience is required if you purchase now, but you're better off watching and waiting until the next big update comes","August 20, 2015","false","44.0"," 78 of 122 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","78","122","8","5"

Why? Because they are developing with the end-game in mind.\n\nOpen-world games are plagued by a common question: "Ok, I'm geared up. What do I do now?" This creates a very strong exit point, and many gamers will stop playing, never to return. Miscreated has a solution to this problem: Base Building. They're not the first to have this idea, but their implementation (even in their first iteration) is excellent. It's free-form. There's no snap to grid. There's no "voxel" system (aka minecraft/space engineers). The possibilities are limited only by your imagination... and the blueprints you find.\n\nBlueprints are an excellent design feature: Blueprints are lootable "plans" that unlock new types of building parts. They also reveal medical and weapon recipes. But here's the thing: They're super-rare. And there are tiers. Although you can build a basic base right when you spawn, you have to constantly search the world, especially high-risk areas, to find the elusive blueprints. And this is a brillant linkage between base-building and looting. Looting in this game is risky, much like in DayZ. But the drive to find new blueprints is a strong incentive to contantly take those risks.\n\nOverall, I've alreay gotten so much more than money's worth, and it's still very early in development. I'm a developer myself, and it's clear to me that the Entrada team is highly competent, and has created a development and asset pipeline that's highly efficient and high-quality.\n\nAlso, this game is utterly gorgeous. The level design is hands-down the best I've ever seen. There's lots of love put into the environments, and little touches everywhere to keep you immersed. Graffiti telling you to "get out," bloody mattresses, massive piles of trash bags, etc. Also, the map is designed to create interesting tactical situations. There are choke-points everywhere, and high-value buildings often force you into a tactical disadvantage.\n\nObviously there are plenty of things that need tuning and polish. Gunplay/controls feel a bit "stiff," there are bugs and netcode/sync issues. I find netcode and server-client synchronization is a challenge in all games of this genre. Because this is early alpha, I will withold judgment on things like animations, controls, stability/quality, and core feature content until I'm relatively sure the game is near completion.\n\nOverall: Buy this game. Do it.","August 25, 2015","true","287.0"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","30","40","2","0"

In-game server browser always has choices, or check out the forums here;  Miscreated Player Servers [miscreatedgame.com]\n\n\nAlright now you don't have to build a base, find yourself a vehicle, (assuming you have gathered the parts required for your vehicle), bring a buddy or maybe pick up a survivor or two and chase tornados, or not. Miscreated at times, can be strictly all out PVP warfare with a chance of camping. Like most servers, whitelisting can help change all that. Which is great for PVE players like myself, where we can also enjoy the game from a different,  less hostile, perspective. If you're one playing for the basebuilding, having a good group to help gather guides will greatly improve your chances of constructiing a stronger base. Don't let those daytime screenshots fool you, Once it's dark, it's going to get creepy, of course only If the server has the Day/Night cycle enabled ;). Sure does get real eerie during the night, looting a house in the rain, hearing cracking on the roof, for a second you can't tell if another survivor or mutant is creepin up on you.\n\nBeing in early access certainly it will have its share of bugs. or awaiting more content for the content already there. Like the invisible mutants, or storage for your items at your base. I have not been around since launch, but if you have a look here at their current state from December 18th of 2015  LINK [miscreatedgame.com] you can see a lot of the games progress, as well as the developers plans (some of which is already added).\n\nLooking forward to what's in store for the future being a part of this community and as Miscreated progresses. The expansion to the upper part of the map is another thing I'm looking forward to seeing. Although my buddy gifted me my copy, I plan to pay it forward by doing the same. I for sure recommend checking this out, either through videos or picking yourself up a copy,\n\nFirst review, thank you for your time.\n\nReview as of 5/15/16","May 14","true","83.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

There are so many small details that were obviously handcrafted that add to the realism. I've spent hours just riding around on a mountain bike exploring the terrain. (Kinda makes Dayz/H1Z1 look like minecraft.)\n+ Well optimized: Getting 60+FPS in most situations on high settings with a GTX 970\n+ Lots of butt clench moments even in low population servers. (There are plenty of healthy full servers but I find the low-medium pop servers are even scarier as you run into survivors when you least expect it. On a server with only 5 players I will still encounter someone every 20-30mins or so in major areas.)\n+ Active development team. Map keeps growing and bugs are getting squashed.\n+ Really fun with friends (when you finally find them / until someone randomly kills you)\n\n___________________\n\n- No compass and the pickup item map is vague & outdated! Finding friends is a pain in the !@# right now.\n- Base building is a little wonky and there is no real storage other then vehicle trunks.\n- Too few vehicles / loot. Groups with bases horde everything and generally kill on sight.\n- Gunplay could use some work... but it does feel better than most competitors in this genre..\n- A.I. monsters are glitchy and pretty stupid in general. Only scary when you are trying to hide from other players.\n- It doesn't take long to get looted enough were there is really no reason to go on because you can't store anything.\n- PVE elements are really lacking at this point. Eventually you just get bored and want to kill everyone/yourself.\n\nOverall: Beautiful well optimized game with amazing potential that is definitely worth picking up. It really just needs a compass, better signage / landmarks & map, more loot, more vehicles, and a proper storage system.","April 27","true","50.0"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","1"

I ran into a couple of players the other day, but I was playing on a server with a ping of almost 350, so I wasn't able to keep up with them and we separated again. Nobody felt the urge to kill one another, which was refreshing. I found a tower. A wooden tower. With ladders and stuff. For about 2 minutes, I ummed and aahed about it, then dared myself, and finally braved the ladders. I made it to the top safely. I then searched the tower and headed back down the ladder again.

The PVP needs to be renovated.. desperately. I feel like I'd have a better chance of hitting the Megamillion Lottery than hitting anything in this game. You get the feel for it after awhile, however it's far from perfect.\n\nLast time we died, we were run over by a car. The interesting thing was, we hid behind a stationary deployable on the map in ample time.. yet we still both died.\n\nWe recently found a car and made it operational. After dieing at inconvenient times, we would reunite with the car and drive it once more. This time, out of nowhere, the car blows up. We had 83% health before venturing into the next town. Suddenly, while cruising down the road, the car catches on fire. The car lost 60% health in about 2 minutes flat (we had not been in a firefight). About 15 seconds later, as we're trying to pull the inventory from the car, it explodes. Cars are a nice touch in this game, but by far the buggiest feature. Sometimes they will start rubberbanding and leave you stranded without your gear. Game over.\n\nThis game has potential, but it needs work..a lot of work.\n\nPVP: 2 / 10. I didn't give it a 1 because the weapon selection and models are above average. Using them is a different story.\n\nTeam Gameplay: 6.5/10. Clans exist, I assume this helps team players with certain aspects of the game. Finding each other will take ages until you learn the map. The only real way to find each other is by suciding. Of course, if one of you has stuff on them, you're going to lose all of it. Once you're at a common location, you're good to go. There is no teleporting (which is good for sake of realism). You're on your own for quite a long time until you learn the map. With that said, playing with others is quite enjoyable. The social aspect of this game gives it its playability.\n\nBuilding: -5/10. There is no point to building a base. There is no storage in this game. Blueprints are hard to find. The structures do not clip together. It will take you about 1 hour to make a 1x2 base, and that's not counting the door and other essentials. You pretty much have to dedicate your life to base building for 0 return. Some people box a car in their base, so they can store stuff in it. Problem is, cars despawn.\n\nPlayability factor: 6/10. Despite all of the shortcomings of this game, it engages me quite well. It is a good game to play when there is nothing else to do. Unfortunately, it seems you never really win in this game because of the bugs. For instance, you have no way of knowing which server you're in. If you want a friend to join your game, you're just out of luck. You can't join via Steam. You can't find out the server's name. You just have to quit and join a common server.\n\nGraphics: 7/10. Cry Engine is quite intensive, but it's worth it. On highest settings using 1080p, the game looks great. The devs did a good job on the map. Unfortunately, there are not enough player models and unique houses, etc.\n\nBug example: -Car glitched and placed me outside of the map (also if you notice, the glitched hitbox of the car killed that guy with little to no contact) - https://youtu.be/rwavSrN8qo8\n-Radiation continues to kill you after you respawn\n-Bikes can't be ran over by cars, so they're impenetrable\n-Can't aim down the sights with a shotgun (shotgun ammo glitches in front of sights) - http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=636908453 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=636908466","January 2","false","52.3"," 98 of 165 people (59%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","59","98","165","38","13"

I was just upstairs in a house during a storm and I faintly heard the footsteps of someone entering the house. At first I thought it was the mutant that was hanging outside, but I could still hear him growling at the side of the house. This was another player in the house with me. I assumed he saw my light through a window or something. I could hear him moving about and my heart was pounding. I hunched down in a corner and pointed my shotgun in the genral direction of the stairs. I could only hope I was looking in the right direction because I didn't dare turn on my flashlight and give myself away. I occasionally heard him move, despite the storm....and he was getting closer!  Right when I thought I was a goner I saw his dark melon head passing a window. Blam! Ninja bandit down. The tactical shotgun at close range is a beast. Thank you for the chocolate bar, Mr. Ninja Bandit.\n\nThis game is worth the money and it's only going to get better as new features are added.","May 4","true","102.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

(Devs livestream info and progress occastionally on their twitch http://www.twitch.tv/miscreated ) Devs seem active and clearly care about the survival aspect of their game.\n\nPros~ Decent alternative for a less hardcore DayZ experience.  Loads of working vehicles.  Plenty of weapons to play around with (if you can find them).  Base building (simple as of now).\n\nCons~ Map could be bigger (I love exploring!) Flying vehicles would be neat- Although not a must have.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimusPalus/recommended/299740/","PrimusPalus","Primus Palus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrimusPalus/","330 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFull review can be found below. I will be providing a quick pro's and con's summary at the top for those that can't be bothered to read words.\n\n\nPro's:\n\n+ CryEngine. Powerful engine that is not used often.\n+ Graphics are better than most similar survival games.\n+ Unlimited potential. They want to do a lot with it, and they very well might.\n+ Cheap. $25 for an indie game is about right. Might seem a little high when compared to the $15 ones.\n\nCon's:\n\n- Brand new, unknown developer. No official studio, no known prior projects.\n- Lack of content (this is to be expected in its current stage).\n- Clunky animations of players, and AI.\n- Broken AI (absolutely not worth even playing for PvE content right now)\n- Boring. It boils down to going in and testing it out, while killing other players. That's all there is to do.\n- Map size is small, and player count too high (as the map expands, I imagine this will be less of an issue). I ran into people left and right when there were 12+ on the server. Ran into 2 people when it had 9 total on the server.\n\n\nFull Review:\n\nDevelopment team - Unknown to the world. Appears that most of the people involved in the project are all overseas and they are coordinating via their website and Skype. No official studio location. The LLC (company) registers out of Utah and the address shows a million dollar home that's up for sale. No other projects that they have worked on that is worth mentioning... so what they are capable of, has yet to be seen.\n\n\nPremise of the game - It's a post apocalyptic world that has been done many times over. Lots of the same old farmland, mountains, and buildings spread out around the map. Only one major town on the map right now, and depending on your spawn point could be an absolute pain to get to. Story goes something along the lines of a (nuclear?) fallout war that destroyed the worlds nations and caused mutants in the process (these are the AI).\n\n\nEngine - Probably the biggest draw for me is the presence of the CryEngine. A pretty powerful engine, it fuels the game and does an ok job at it. Small things like water beading off of your face (screen) when swimming, and lighting is definitely gained from here. There are some issues that I'll explain more about later that I would imagine they'll need to smooth out with the engine.\n\n\nGraphics - Surprisingly, the game is stable with the graphics cranked to the max. I get about 50fps and not a single crash yet. The graphics look good, but certainly not amazing. We're not talking Crysis CryEngine level graphics here. They're definitely not going to require the absolute top of the line PC. I run a AMD 1075T (3.0ghz) CPU, an R9 270X 4G graphics card, and 16GB of g.skill RAM (1600mhz). I don't have any issues at all but then my set up is probably better than most casual players. I will say I was a little impressed with some of the lighting (like the flashlights at night) and effects. I had to immediately turn off the garbage head bob and blur.\n\n\nPerformance - As stated above I get an average of about 50fps constant. I've not had any crashes though I did get a black screen after activating the showfps command. I ended up having to kill the process to get back in-game. Players are pretty smooth, though it's clear that some people do warp around a little (this could be a communication issue with everyone involved, or just that player having a bad connection). Most people I ran into, didn't do this for me.\n\n\nAnti-cheat -  Non-existent as far as I'm aware. I went onto the dev forums and asked about the anti-hack plans... I was told and I quote... "We have a bunch of ninjas spying you". I've asked for some clarification, but I'm wondering if they're going to try the whole approach that Nether did of, "We'll monitor players with staff". Which clearly failed.\n\n\nContent - As an early Alpha, it lacks all content. You have food and drink items, you have some melee weapons, a single pistol, but that's about it. Some clothing items makes your character model (same male figure for everyone) look a little different than the next guy, but not by much. At one point I found a pistol, and the largest backpack in the game... and that was end game for me. This is all expected to improve over time, so understand where it sits now in the development stage. Of note for future content is a building system shown in a video, vehicles, and more.\n\n\nAI - The game features mutants as opposed to zombies. Right now they're utterly broken. So stand in place and do nothing, some sprint around and lag out. Others stand still and hit you from dozens of feet away (by swinging their arm). There's only one mutant skin, so it got old real quick. Killing them? Not possible. Just hitting them did return damage to me and killed me. So don't even try it. There are some wild animals... but they also did return damage to me. I did see a mutant kill a deer, but I wasn't entirely sure I could do anything with the dead animal.\n\n\nWar Z (Comparison) - Has the same feel to it. Same clunky animations, same map design look, and limited content. Graphics while a major step up, it pales in comparison to other CryEngine games and looks downright BLEH a lot of the time. I found some textures to be blurry and flickering... other things I could walk through or fall through. This all occurred in the War Z too and ruined any immersion I was seeking.\n\n\nNether (Comparison) - Same clunky fast paced running which was also a trait from the War Z. The urban terrain was just there... buildings open, with items on shelves, on the floor, and in boxes. The most exciting thing to see is a refrigerator that opens and you can find something inside like food or a drink. Unlike both Nether and War Z, there wasn't a gear explosion when someone died. I was happy to see these devs took the time to make gear on the ground require some interaction.\n\n\nBuy or no buy - At this stage of the game I would wait. I'll recommend it as being worth getting but it's severely lacking. At the development stage it's in right now, I couldn't see getting too much out of it. You can run around and find stuff, kill someone, and then get glitch killed in return. Not very exciting. If you're hoping for content, now is not the time to buy in. If you want to help an indie developer... by all means for $25 you can get it on Steam. Solely up to you.","November 2, 2014","true","4.2"," 28 of 41 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","28","41","0","0"

First time positive, second time a frustrated negative, but in fairness the potential has always been there, and progress has never stopped even if in some cases it was too slow, but they are a growing Indie, and not a bad one.  Just not always great with PR (frankly not too many developers are) but they are responsive.  The game now has reached a plateau from which I think the player base (already decently active) will really begin to grow, and I predict that the old, early "mixed review" state will soon be overcome.\n\nHere is a brief review and outlook, subject to updates:\n\n!.  There are most always active servers with players, base building and other shenanigans going on.\n2.  A lot of stuff to do.  Foraging, scouting, exploring, surviving mutants, working with or against other survivors, base building (and it's pretty good too!)\n3.  Vehicles are fun.  There are still a few bugs, but nothing game stopping for the greater part.  You can find and operate a bicycle, tractor, atv, pickup truck, airport tow cart, 5 ton military truck that can haul up to ten guys, and a boat with outboard motor.  Except for the bicycle you need to scavenge the right parts to get them going, but it's very doable.  You can also destroy the vehicles :)\n4.  Quite a few servers, so that you can usually find very active games, or low population games if you want a different speed, and also some servers that promote RP or No KOS, etc, although friendly fire is always on at present.  A few servers may require you to be whitelisted to join.\n5.  Best looking open world survival adventure yet, and as of now dynamic weather features are in.  Yes that is a tornado.  No, don't drive into it.  Well...maybe drive into it :)\n\n\nAs for stuff that ISN'T fully ready:\n\n*Crafting is good, but not fully evolved.  Hunting animals doesn't have real benefit yet, for instance.\n*opening/closing doors and containers.  Some of this used to be in the game, but is currently unavailable because of sync issues that are being explored.  Doors can be fun of course, but the variety of structures doesn't make this a huge issue for now.  Ladders however DO work and are in.\n*Persistent external storage is the single biggest game changer that is not yet implemented, but I am confident that it will get here.  The whole item system code is involved in implementing the new storage features, so the rollout on that is a big job, and I see no point in badgering them about it as they are aware how vital it is.\n\nThe game is worth it at this point and beyond, especially on sale.  Just realize that it's still "early access", even though there is not a lot for you to be concerned about at this stage.  Also please check the system requirements.  Game looks good on low settings, but you really must meet minimum spec!","April 19","true","325.1"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","18","23","0","0"

But to be fair it's basically a better H1Z1, a much better infestation or whatever the hell those greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are calling their game this week. Not as good as DayZ after thier 6.0 patch in my opinion but this game isn't bad at all and worth the $20 bucks if you got it to throw down for one of these games.\n\nGenerally I think this game suffers from a pretty unintuative user interface (I had a gun, pressed R to reload ammo from my inventory into it...had to do it through the G menu). The loot tables are pretty slim pickings, But I think this is pretty common for these kinds of games, one week its guns and ammo everywhere and next week theres no food anywhere cause devs are always messing with it, which is fine. I think alot of the animations are pretty janky, which is fine. performance is actually...pretty damn good, had 60+ FPS with no hitching or drops (had two small 2 second hiccups while it was raining super hard, which is pretty dismissable)\n\nOverall, this thing has potential to be decent and in the very least a nice break from DayZ while they are getting their ♥♥♥♥ together for some of the patches where the game is literally unplayable, decent work devs. Keep it up, but it's a long road ahead for you boys.","May 17","true","10.6"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","13","14","0","0"

Miscreated was pretty bad back then when i remember it so i left it. Fast forward roughly 7 months and i hop back on Miscreated and i'm quite happy with what i get. Base building, new animations, slightly bigger community, etc. Game is looking great and for a small dev team, updates aren't decades away or hour updates with rushed work.\n\nOnce i came back to miscreated i noticed something good.  The first 5 players i ran into were young adults which is a good sign. The community isn't ALWAYS kill on sight but a game can't avoid kill on sight. You can't punish a survival game when the point of the game is survival even if that is killing on sight. Back on track, i met up with this guy. We talked for a bit and he brought me ack to his base. He gave me some basic stuff and we set out. This night was the night i started my miscreated clan that lasted well over 3 months. We met up with 3 other people and tagged along, Then with another 2 people and lastly with 1 lone wolf. We had a gang. We had so many members we had to make a distinct look for eachother so we wouldn't injure or kill eachother in combat. So we all went muscle shirt. We were the Muscle Shirt Gang. We chilled for a good 6 hours that day and played very late into the night.\n\nAfter we establised ourselves the fun began. My bud brought us all to his base and we sat in a circle and told jokes, laughed and had a good ol'time. It was a blast. This lasted a while and we started branching out making our on bases. slowly we started raiding other bases and we successfully raided over 10 bases in our time. Raiding is tough in miscreated so raids take some time due to the manwork you have to put in to take down 1 wall.\n\nThe group lasted for 3 months until we disbanded, slowly we just left eachother, no good byes, no good lucks, just leaving 1 by 1. Out of all people i still have 1 good guy i play games with. This guy i play with doesn't just play Miscreated with me anymore, but tons of other games too. He is undoubtly my best online bud to hop on and play some survival games with.\n\nOverall, my experience was amazing. I met a lot of cool, mature people and had a blast. I can't say your experience will be the same or as good as mine, but i can say the games is a blast and is a bargain. Who knows you might have a better experience than me! They even lowered the price a few dollars so it's a good game.\n\nIm sad my review and adventures have come to an end but yours can start so pick up this game and go enjoy it.","November 21, 2015","true","82.8"," 19 of 25 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","19","25","4","1"

Even runs well on low end pcs at low settings.\n-Base building that is fun as hell.  You can basically build anywhere you want, hold down a road if u like. Creates interesting gameplay\n-Dynamic weather is interesting and scary (storms actually make the game feel eerie)\n\nCONS:\n\n-Private servers are only available through one provider.  Kinda slimy and I assume a way for the devs to cut extra profit, the provider is also overpriced.\n-Server files aren't public, so making a modded server with oxide or any API will not be possible :(\n-Dying happens really fast. If you get shot in the head or chest and its a kill shot, you will instantly go to a death screen and not be able to see how you died or who killed you.  You almost never even hear the gun fire that killed you because it instantly turns to death screen.\n-No storage system for bases yet, but apparently coming in the next patch so don't let that discourage you.\n\nOverall this game is a lot of fun.  The devs update a lot and the gameplay is awesome.  I wish they would make server files public and will continue to fight for that to happen.

Anyways, it looked decent on video, but when I played it, I wasn't too impressed.  I recently tried it again and was actually impressed.  The game still needs a lot of work, but it doesn't look half bad.  The gameplay isn't bad either.  As long as you're on a server with players.

This game has a lot of potential to be the best of its genre. I would recommend this game to my friends and the steam community, but not just yet. That's simply only because at the moment there isn't really to much to do in-game. I do expect great things to keep rolling out from the dev's though, so far they have been very interactive with there players and are always open to feedback. This is probably one of the best early access dev teams currently, and that says a lot about them really especially for how small of a team they are. So in short this is a great game, i personally wouldnt buy it until they add some more features, but if your looking for a game to support that has the means to be the next big thing.

I felt bad that I didn't take the opportunity to play, as while we were chatting about the horror/survival genre in general (a la The Forest, Amnesia, DayZ, etc.) a few spots opened up. I declined to play, but did want to check back in to say that this game is absolutely beautiful and the gameplay is addictive: slinking around an apocalyptic mountain region, looting anything you can find in an effort to either not get mauled by a roaming zombie, or killed by another player. What's not to like?\n\nThe day/night cycles are amazing, and I just witnessed my first lightning storm which was incredible; CryEngine FTW. And while friendly confrontations with players are possible, most end in bloodshed, but some are akin to two ships passing in the night, if you're lucky - and not armed enough to want to attack the other person :-)\n\nCrafting is interesting; it seems like it would take a _lot_ of effort to build a structure. I was lucky enough to find a hatchet during a random spawn once, and given the inventory size, it just wasn't feasible. Even with several more slots; I'm also not sure I'd want to put effort into a structure that I probably won't be able to find later, but maybe there's an ability to set a respawn point; not sure, but that'd be ideal. I have many an hour on ARK, and while dying in hardcore survival is expected, I do feel as though I really shouldn't get attached to any items whatsoever in Miscreated since I've yet to recover a body. I don't mind this though - I've read a lot of quibbling about loot being too sparse, and that happens to be a major plus for me; loot is extremely valuable in this game; that's awesome; it's a bold choice that not a lot of games take, and I think that really set it apart from the rest.","May 4","true","6.3"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

After hearing some strange sounds I begin looking for people...It seems I can hear them all around me. As I spin around in a circle it seems I hear more, no wait. Is that my own footsteps? What is this clanking sound that makes me think I'm being shot at? Paranoia sets in as I trudge on down a dirt road. I soon spot a house that is of course abandoned I look everywhere for something to smack around these things that have been following me should they get ballsy enough. Nothing but a 'plebsi' and some ravioli...I look out the window to see a blurry house in the distance...yes, I must go there I tell myself. I keep hearing these sounds so I yell out "Hey, IS ANYONE THERE''? No response of course..I run out the door, jump the 4-5 foot tall fence without a scratch and press on...More sounds, this time it sounds like someone is swinging. I turn around frantically looking for the source. NOTHING. My sight blurrs...then darkness all around me. I guess I closed my eyes because in an instant everything was back to normal. Just a fluke I guess..I make my way to the next house cautiously and find a hatchet! Oh, ho ho! The smile that came over my face...I grab the axe in my right hand and swing wildly cutting everything in the house...which oddly enough has the same sound for everything I hit.

Maybe paranoia has gotten the best of me..I call out again 'Hey, anyone see this? The sky is weird' Again, nothing.

I have played DayZ and Miscreated; personally, Miscreated scores the win on this one. The game runs smooth on ultra with the gameplay and combat much more satisfying than DayZ. And like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t DayZ throws on us, this game is actually developing with regards to what the early access players want. Currently there are enough number of weapons to satisfy the marksman in you, but more are being added with each upcoming patch! Moreover, if you're into co-op, there are a few friendly servers that maintain a healthy relationship between every player. Now it's impossible to find a less-eccentric player that does not want blow a hole through your head in DayZ. So Miscreated is worth the buy and I recommend one buys it now because with it's potential, it might increase the price once the early access is done, which I'm pretty sure will happen soon.\nIn short, Miscreated is the best of it's kind on Steam right now.

The environs are beautifully crafted.  The interiors feel real, the exteriors are very convincing.  The rats and snakes scattering about are a great touch (although I couldn't kill and eat them).  Almost everything felt right.  I'm not saying there isn't room for improvement but the dev team clearly knows where that is and given what they've done so far, this game will be a sight to behold when it's complete.\n\nObservations:  As far as game-play, there is clearly work to be done. But there are some great steps they've already made that are evident in the current build.  I like the limited inventory and the ability to store stuff in my shirt pocket.  There is work to be done on what has been implemented and obviously, there are many needed features (such as storage and fleshing out crafting).  A few things that disappointed me.  First, I want to be able to interact with everything, 7DTD has done an amazing job with this but their world in nowhere near as visually rich.  I get there's a trade-off happening here but a happy middle ground would be appreciated. 7DTD has to execute on a few things yet but it is poised to be one of the best games I've ever played.  Completely augmentable environments is the reason why, and this alone will make me overlook any number of it's shortcomings.\n\nClearly, after reading some of the devs posts, they are on the right path and have a unique and interesting take on a very overdone theme.  But they have a lot of work to do in order to compete with 7DTD.\n\nThe Bad:  I played for about 2 hours and then it crashed (as of 10/10/2015).  I can't open the game anymore.  after looking at how active the devs are, I have confidence they will fix it.\n\nFinal:  If you have limited funds, wait for this one to develop more.  But, If you, like me, enjoy supporting game development go for it.","October 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","15","20","0","0"

I don't blame this game though.\nI play on a 14'' laptop and I haven't played FPS with Keyboard+mouse for six months, I only play RTS with K+M and for other games with my XO controller, however I play most of the FPS on ps4 with a bigger monitor.\nI think one of reasons is I have to turn around and look closely at objects in order to find loots, so play it on a bigger screen guys for your eyes and your health and your playing pleasure.\n\nAfter exitting the game I couldn't do anything else for the entire day so I had to keep watching Youtube videos and I couldn't start writing my application essay until 8PM\n\nBut this game looks absolutely stunning, good texture, good fx, animation in game is way much better than what they showed in the video up there, everything is good and it runs so smooth. Atomsphere done right, I did expect zombie when I enter buildings, and I encountered the first zombie in a building, really immersive. And the loots show up in where they are supposed to show up, JOB VERY WELL DONE!  DayZ 0.60 is still on the way so this game is currently somehow better than DayZ, excet DayZ doesn't make me dizzy (I played DayZ and ArmA2 and ArmA3 for over one thousand hours so I'm pretty used to their engine)\n\nCommunity is fine, met pretty much five people today only one guy tried to kill me with a baseball bat","April 24","true","1.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","2"

It is a very under rated game and deserves a lot more attention. The lack of players right now is not a bad thing, infact for me it was great, it allowed me to get a grip of how the game worked and how the engine feels. For me it was amazing, even with every setting maxed out, I had a smooth 45-60 FPS deep in very detailed parts of the map and I dont have the best of PCs.\n\nSecondly, the engine for this game right now feels and plays wonderfully. I have not come across any major bugs, especially for such a unpopular game, that's amazing. Loot seems to work just fine, and as far as I can tell the base building it good, and the raiding system works moderatly well for such an early access game.\n\nIf this game had sufficient advertising I believe it would easily of been a better hit than other popular survival games which turned out pretty crappy, *cough* you know which ones im talking about.\n\nFinally, this game reaches out and takes aspects of other survival games out there, bundling it into one great, beautiful and smooth game THAT ACTUALLY WORKS *GASP*. It truly does deserve more attention and more advertising.","October 20, 2015","true","392.1"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","17","24","3","0"

Also this game has been heavly modifed and improved the last 2 months which sets a side the negative views from the past as honestly wasnt that good.\n\nYES IT ♥♥♥♥ING IS EARLY ACCESS but let me tell you something its a ♥♥♥♥ing good early access game. I had a game for 3 days and yes there are a few bug here and there but non of them stop you from playing the game.\n\nFor example: Flickering lght, Yes it has been noticed by the devs and its being worked on but there is a simple fix. Restart the game.  BOOM DONE OMFG its magic. (it rarly ever happens)\n\nAnother example: Can click on a teb or cant find a server. BOOM restart DONE!!! (happned once out of 35 times i launched it.\n\nThis game has so much potential and dont get me started on the graphics and it by far has the best looking graphics then any other survival game out there. (this game makes dayz look like a 2d game)\n\nSo back to the game play.\n\nI personnaly like the hardcore gameplay and finding people in game now is not a problem. Recently its been getting attention as it should. It takes a while to loot up as that is relistic and not everyone has guns which means alot of melee action and if they do have a gun the gun probably dont have more then 8 shots . as ammon is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing rare.\n\nIf I were to rate the game on the gameplay it would be 10/10\nFluent and stable game                                                     8/10  There are minor bugs but non affect gameplay as a simple restart would do.\n\nShould you get it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawford_otter/recommended/299740/","crawford_otter","Suspicious Filing Cabinet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crawford_otter/","37 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm going to talk about the good to this game first, then the negative before I offer my suggestions.\n\nFirstly, this game is fun in many ways. It is a gritty, semi-realistic survival simulator. Using crazy people instead of zombies is very interesting and breaks away from the norm, so kudos on that.\n\nI also like the fact loot isn't just sprawled every two feet across the game world and that you have to actually LOOK for it. It isn't always in the open people. The "mutants" are strong and freaky, which is good because it adds to the challenge. It makes you have to actually use your brain and think, strategize about what you do instead of just charging in and killing everything that moves.\n\nNow where it needs improvement. Although I DO like the realism of having to search for loot instead of it laying in the open, it is a bit TOO difficult to find anything useful half the time. Not to mention you usually end up running into the enemies before you even find a t-shirt, which brings me to my next point.\n\nHaving difficult enemies can be a good thing, but the problem with this game is it isn't balanced. Risk versus reward is key in these games, and with the enemies being so much faster and stronger than the player, it makes things very frustrating.\n\nThe other area that needs improvement is re-spawning. There needs to be something coded into the game that prevents you from being spawned too close to mutants. Close is fine at times, but there has to be a line. At one point, I actually respawned across the map directly in a group of 6 or 7 mutants! I'm talking surrounded and inches away. I didn't even try to run.\n\nOverall, I would say it is very well executed for an early access pre-alpha game. It is fun and entertaining but can be VERY frustrating. My recommendation would be to go for it and try it. It might seem like the price tag is high versus the issues but consider other games in the genre. It may or may not get MORE expensive down the road once it is done.\n\nMy suggestions are as follows:\n1. Tone down the mutants strength and/or size a little bit, it far outweighs the reward.\n2. Rather than toning them all down, maybe consider scaling each one differently for variety, some weaker than others and some stronger.\n3. If the enemies are not scaled, at the very least make offensive/defensive loot a bitmore prevalent. Kinda sucks to get trapped in a huge building that has nothing but clothing and ammo for guns you can never find\n4. Improve the respawn coding. Again, it sucks big time to be spawned inches from the mutant threat.\n\nKeep an open mind when playing this game, and if you leave a review, be it good or negative, try to be constructive instead of flaming the boards. The game gets better by constructive criticism not rudeness.","January 17","true","14.2"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

If you are not sure what that means, do some research.\n- The negative reviews were due to a rocky launch back in 2014, as you'll see, you'll need to scroll quite a bit until you reach a true, honest negative review(Yeah, because most people seem to forget what Alpha means, and what your job, as a TESTER, is).\nThat said, I'm wondering where to start for Miscreated..\nIt is a breeze of fresh air in the genre I would say. I've had more fun with Miscreated than I did in DayZ or other survival games akin to it.\n\n\nPositive+It is genuinely fun. Playing with friends, or even just meeting a random stranger can be tense and end up in a very fun experience. Or not. But it'll still be funny!\n+Great Dev communication, Devs actually CARE, and you can SEEand EXPERIENCE how much work they've put into this game.\n+Rare KoS(Kill on Sight)\n+Great optimization\n+Great graphics\n+Great Gameplay\n\nNegative- Loading into a server takes a while, although it has been confirmed it varies depending on hardware(usually 3 minutes for me)..\n\n\nNow thing is, I can only really point out that one flaw, simply because there's really not much more that's "bad" about it.\nWho in their right mind would add "bugs" as a negative point to an early access alpha? Of course it has bugs, glitches, spazzing vehicles that kill you if you get close, but they're constantly being worked on. I've only played for about 10 hours, but I've been following development before I purchased the game, because Dev activity with the community is something I value a lot.\n\n\nThe game has a good amount of content so far, and what's done so far is good. Do I have suggestions? Sure, but as soon as you start playing you'll also understand the Dev's vision for this game. New features and content are implemented, and the Devs are very open about it, with live streams, roadmaps, etc Basebuilding will be implemented soon, and although I was kind of worried about how it would work, the devs actually took the time to explain everything and I'm now looking forward to it!\n\nTLDR: I totally reccomend this game, it's certainly a gem in the middle of a saturated market of survival games that have become a trend in the recent years, and it seems like the perfect game to stick to, to be a part of, and help grow.","June 20, 2015","true","18.8"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","16","23","0","0"

The graphics is good, and to be an alpha game it is really easy to run, you dont need a kickass computer to run this game at max settings.\nWhen it comes to building I would say they have to do some more work, like when placing a wall onto an platform, its an gap between the platform and the wall, you can lower or raise platforms, that means you have to find an area that is completly flat, kind of dissapointing for a game that looks as good and dont have to many bugs.\nOnly bugs discoverd so far is the vehicle sounds, they do sometimes not sound at all if your friend is driving the vehicle. They should consider that when you cut trees to get wood piles the tree should fall down after some wood piles.\nAfter some more playing, the weapons reaload should have been done someting with, should have made it possible to reload with a button and not have to get into inventory and then change mag on the inventory slots.\nFor the blueprints, wood and so for base should have not been on blueprints if you ask me, have benn looting for 10 hours, back and forwards into diffrent towns and buildings around, have just found silly things that i absolutly dont need to craft.\nStorage box or safe or something like that should have been ingame. For the vehicles , od that you can store just as much in a car or quad bike as in a truck ? does not make any sence for me.\n\nAs the game looks now, it might be an really good game when it is done","March 6","true","27.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I don't think ANY other survival type game has nailed the atmoshphere of this game. The map is such plain drop dead gorgeous!!!!! When you go into a town it feels so realistic. Everything is overgrown and looks like a real apocolypse has happened. I love that there are so many places to hide and sneak around. The first time a deer darts out of a bush, it scares the crap out of you. The feeling of being one of the last few survivors is incredible. The lighting and the leaves gently falling around you. The rats scurrying from garbage almost makes you smell the stench. Loot is hidden among things and you have to actually search to find some of it. There is no watching a circle spin and count down here. If you don't search you may not find.\n\nEverything is so detailed. The houses, the interiors of different things. There are even tunnels to explore.\n\nYour map has been so thoughtfully designed. If you are a lone wolf explorer it is just a joy to look around and see what you can find. If you are looking for pvp, I can't think of a better designed map. You can hide and ambush from so many different places. You can sneak around on hidden goat paths. You can hide in craggy rocks and defend yourself if pinned down. The trees and bushes and even the undergrowth provides great concealment. Dayz could only dream of having this kind of environment and have it run this smooth. I have a 680Ti and a 2600k and I run this thing maxed out and it's smooth as butter.\n\nThe vehicles are fun to drive and easy to control. This game has so much potential it is staggering. Is it perfect? Obviously not. The mutants need work, and more variety. More weapons, scopes, binoculars, different clothing and different character models are going to eventually be needed. I have no doubt that all of those things will come as the game engine is tweaked and they get the connection problems sorted out for some people.\n\nIf you need a game that has lots of players involved in it right away, you may want to wait. If you enjoy exploring and watching a game evolve, this is the best I have seen to date and I hope the devs get tons of support once they start to market it more. Great job devs!

Not a big survival fan, am now. Spent hours on end exploring, going into every house, walking through the woods and finding cabins, wildlife, rivers, creeks, deer trails, random dirt roads, its endless. But its not boring, the whole time you're doing it is literally a blast, very immersive.  The Cry engine looks amazing, awesome draw distance, wonderful textures, overall very polished and the game is still in alpha. I can only expect more amazing updates from the boys at Entrada. You make friends and enemies, find some trolls every now and then, find abandon bases, fallen players with possibly that little bit of food you need in their possession, Game play mechanics are wonderful, have already gotten two of my good friends into this game and they absolutely love it. I  really haven't been doing much gaming lately but I've been spending a lot of time with my computer thanks to this purchase. I think the crafting system is great, and have been staying updated with the dev blogs and what they have in store will be only improvements. I really recommend this game for really anyone since I am not the type to play this kind of game, but i have thoroughly enjoyed it and have been hooked since i bought it.\n\n\nOne thing I would change, and don't bash me, I know the bicycles are the newest update, but you can be going as slow as you can and if you accidentally hit a friend it kills them immediately. I still haven't figured out body temperature yet, and have yet to see the radiation bar go up. None of this has even bothered me, it is more of just figuring out how everything works. I also wish you could have a game lobby, and maybe some sort of kill cam besides just going to a black screen leaving you wondering how you even died.\n\ni give it a 10/10, considering how it stacks up against other survival games, like dayz being in alpha for ages. I'm genuinely excited to see what in store for this game, i have not touched any one of the other 15 games on my computer since i have got it, I'm excited to get home and play it everyday, explore more of the map, see what other items I can craft or find, or find new buddies to play with. Keep it up Entrada, amazing game, seriously, I love it.","March 4","true","16.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

Combined with trying to avoid or possibly kill the existing mutants or survivors.\n\nSomething to note considering every other survival game has this issue is, the community isn't entirely a " Kill on Sight " type of mentality which is good, you'll get people chatting with you, trading or even possibly grouping up to defend against bandits or you may even decide to build your own base and hoard all the loot in the universe.\n\nThe developers also seem very passionate about their game and are listening to feedback and followed by that is great ideas for future updates which will definitely make this game even better, personally i would like to see more mutants so i'd be swarmed with no hope of surviving, possibly increasing the limitations on how many objects you can have in your base ( followed by storage containers so you can hold all your items instead of throwing some away ) also i would like to see the temperature system back, because i've heard people talk about it and it sounds very interesting.\n\nI highly recommend this game for i have enjoyed my time so far. I shall continue playing this whilst also keeping an eye out for the magnificent updates which take place.

It's so early access that it's almost impossible to log into any server (specially in Europe), even an empty one. I've bought the game to try it out and so far could't manage to play one time. I've spent about 23 euros for the possibility of a good game I can't play.\nI have no question about it going to be a good survival game in the near future, so I recommend everyone to wait some more time for the developer's to make Miscreated somewhat more stable.\n\nEDIT:\nThey sent out Patch #8 - 11/26/2014\nThis patch is to address some of the server stability and client frame rate issues and does not contain any new content. It is the build we've been testing on the experimental server the last couple of days.\n\nBUT!!!\n\nNOTE: There is still a lingering issue where the servers will randomly cause connecting clients to hang at the Synchronizing screen. Because of this issue, we will still be restarting the servers on a regular basis for now.

It seemed just like a prettier version of a Dayz knockoff. Recently I took a second look and documented some of my play time and I am glad I did. The game is beautiful, without a doubt one of the prettiest enviroments I have experienced in any game, let alone a survival sim. It has lush forests beautiful water and all the homes look lived in. The developers paid close attention to make oridnary homes tell a story to the player. You may find a skull in a childs room, or boxes in a pile in a room as if the owners were attempting to gather their belongings and evacuate. These items a long with the scenery are some of the big pros to this game. Now, the game runs beautiful and the developers seemed to have paid attention to server optimization and making the game run smooth, as opposed to Dayz which in itself is pretty, but runs like a brick. The game features a crafting menu, as well as items to equip on your character. You can fight unarmed, but melee weapons and guns are available. Vehicles also appear in the game, as well as parts to repair them If there is a con, it is definatley the lack of player models and the limited amount of zombies. These things are trivial and will most likely be added in eventually and do not warrant a negative review in my opinion.","April 19","true","2.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Graphics are great (Cryengine), combat feels smooth, survival is balanced - you will find food but if you're settling down to make a base you'll eventually need to go back to a city. Vehicles take effort (finding oil, fuel, drive belt, battery and spark plug) to get to work if you happen to find one so it's pretty satisfying/bit worrying driving about in one. Mutants are a decent threat if you're not equipped to deal with them, if you don't have a gun it's worth teaming and kiteing them to loot or just choosing a different, less infested zone.\n\nAny issues are actively worked on by a small but dedicated group of developers who are present in the community and respond to any problems the players report.\n\nMost of the negative reviews you'll see are from the initial release of the alpha when there were limited features and fewer players.","November 3, 2015","true","110.5"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

This also runs on a way better engine the DayZ, which makes the experience much more intuitive. The graphics are amazing, which means you need a decent gaming rig.

I run it on a laptop and I'm getting 60FPS anywhere on the map even in city areas (well done CryEngine)  Not only that, but the visual quality on this game is simply breathtaking, lot's of beautiful sceneries to explore and the developers have also added some pretty cool hidden locations to discover as well.\n\nThe only con to this game imo is the fact that everyone runs at the same pace, though the weight of your gear is suppose to slow you down, i really don't see a difference and makes it nearly impossible for a solo player to evade any large group of hostile players or even someone with an axe if you're out of ammo. If players had an exhaustion level then there would at least be more of a strategic behind sprinting.\n\nAlso, i've had many incidents where players i'm engaging in battle with would quickly exit game only to later return in order to replenish their blood loss and have the nerve to brag about it in game chat. That's a huge disappointment. Maybe try to add a certain amount of seconds before the players in-game character actually despawns, it'll add some anxiety to those players that try to cheat death.\n\nOverall: 4.8","May 13","true","341.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

My play style in an open world game is typically as a wandering explorer. The map really sets the atmosphere of the game and there is a ton of detail. All the basic game mechanics work but there are some rough edges, especially with inventory management. I've had this game since it came out but honestly only started playing it to any extent after the latest patch, #35. In this update they added weather effects which are very well done. I look forward to having more survival mechanics such as hunting and cooking. Those are on the roadmap but progress has been slow. Overall I would reccomend this game if you are a fan of the genre and enjoy immersing yourself in a game environment.

The basics are all there, but the controls can feel a little loose and clunky.\n\nThere is also an overwhelming lack of zombies (or whatever they are in this game) and weapons. Because of the lack of guns, the game lends itself to shoot-on-sight tactics to protect your loot which somewhat spoils the experience of encountering other players, because unless you are a fresh-spawn you're almost guaranteed to get killed immeadiately.\n\nThe best thing about this game is that unlike the others in this category *cough* DayZ *cough* this game is actually going somewhere in it's development.\n\nThis game is an investment, but one that I think will pay off in the end.","May 27","true","3.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

There are some great positives about the game. It's  very beautiful with realistic terrain and a peaceful, post apocalyptic atmosphere. I met some great people that brought me into their group. This being said, it doesn't make up for the overall lackluster nautre of the game. It just doesn't deliver, even for an early release and especially for the price.\n\n-- World load times are very, very long. A little faith is needed to stick with the game when you log on as it seems that the client froze up. With a good computer and internet connection, it still takes a few minutes.\n\n-- It's laggy when you move or turn your head, making it difficult to get immersed in the game. It's also a HUGE pain for trying to fight when turning quickly is probably the most important factor in killing or being killed.\n\n-- There are few options for customizing the audio, video, or gameplay settings. Far far fewer than even the standard options offered in most games.\n\n-- You spawn with nothing and spend A LOT of time to gather even basic food and weapons. Upon death, you lose everything. There is no way to store items except on your person. While starting from scratch and high death penalty can be seen as desirable things, not being able to rathole items, create defensive structures, or spawn relatively close to your body is very tedious. Getting to even a basic level of combat readiness can take anywhere from 10 to 30 minutes, depending on the luck of your spawn. Since PvE, PvP, and environmental hazards can lead to death relatively frequently, the fourth or seventh or twentieth time you have to start from scratch gets very old.\n\n-- Items are a Catch 22. Players make the game interesting and items help you survive the playres. Item spawns are generally slow and certain useful ones are denser in a handful of areas (such as finding guns at the airbase). This means on maps with the highest chance of dieing (large numbers of players), there are fewer guns, ammo, melee weapons, and even basics such as food and water. It's almost neccesary to go to servers with few to no people on them in order to stock up after a death, but without other people, the danger is removed and the game is much less interesting. What's left is about 20-30 minutes of chore-like scavenging. The spawn rates should increase with the amount of people on the server, but it doesn't. This means you are continuously unprepared/spending inordinate amounts of time preparing on a high-traffic server, efficiently gathering on a low traffic server where there is a neglible chance of needing the items, or being forced to regularly switch back and forth, suffering through the long world load times twice after every death.\n\n-- Despite a cool international community, the game doesn't support squad or multiplayer things for friends. The voice chat is difficult to hear and cuts out, almost requiring TeamSpeak instead of the ingame option. There are no ways to signal to them, or make a squad. It's difficult to tell people apart (my group took our shoes off to show we were allies -- if a stranger did the same, they'd blend in seamlessly). There is no revive or stabilize option (though this was mentioned as a future project) meaning that on death you respawn FAR away from your team. This takes a lot of time to run back to your team while they either sit and wait or run to you. Often, it is much quicker to suicide repeatedly until you spawn closer to them. A game which has suicide incentives like this is flawed.\n\n-- The items are boring. The food, water, and soda show the most diversity and still lack creativity. (low quality graphics, lack of humor or character in branding, uninteresting containers) Cars are difficult to find and repair, but once made are simply a slightly faster way of getting around. Driving is clumsy and doesn't offer adrenaline pumping speed, maneuverability, or offensive capability. After being used, you basically have to leave the car when you log off, making the return on time invested a lot less worthwhile. Guns are not customizable and have one model per class for the most part. A single revolver, handgun, bolt action rifle, semi auto rifle, shotgun, etc. Reloading is also a pain, requiring one to open inventory and manually place ammo into the gun.\n\n-- There are no safe zones, civilians, occupied towns, engaging or interesting NPCs, opportunities to trade, etc. Interactions with other players fall into three categories -- 1) they want to kill you 2) they want to join up to be protected from people that want to kill you 3) they don't want anything to do with you. Very shallow interactions.\n\n-- Fall damage is ridiculous. Even a minor fall, say 10 feet, can lead to death. Rocks are especially difficult since they act almost slippery. It would make FAR more sense to have a realistic injury, such as sprained ankle impairing movement speed, or even breaking ones legs on a decent fall.\n\n-- There isn't the ability to create a 'home' or defensive structure in this sandbox world. You can't build walls, barricade a house, dig into a hill, build a fort, establish a clan, set real traps, create defenses. Outside of this nomadic existence, there isn't a more defensive way to play. You either scavenge and kill with a team, or do so alone.\n\n-- You can't interact with most of the world. Buildings don't change and are not destructible. Doors can't be opened or closed anymore. Trees can be cut for wood but do not get chopped down. Things such as flimsy wood baricades or small trees will stop a full speed car. Sleeping bags can't be looted. Books can't be read. Objects such as dumpsters or boxes can't be moved. Boxes or containers can't be broken to see what's inside.\n\n-- Navigating is difficult and imo, unrealistic. Every road connecting cities and towns has signs poiting out directions, roads, advertisements, etc. In Miscreated, everything is pretty much along Route 88, all the gas stations look the same, and it's truly difficult to figure out where you are. The answer is to play long enough (and die often enough) that you memorize landmarks and spawn points. These are not iconic landmarks, mind you, but things like "does the generic bridge have two, three, or four sections?" Each town looks very similar, lacking even the most rudimentary differences like business or street signs. The maps found on boards near some spawn points should be able to be 'committed to memory' in the game, but instead, one has to actually memorize a 2D, non-topographical map which only outlines rivers, oceanfront, and land. Even without this, a player should have the option of finding a AAA map in a gas station to take along as an item.\n\n-- There isn't a plot or storyline.  It takes time to gather supplies, but you pretty much cap out at maximum weapons, carrying capacity, and ammo  quickly so there isn't much room for growth. PvP is largely who sees who first. There are no achievements or fun things to strive for. Killing mutant spikers and other players offers very limited reward of the items they were carrying (especially since if you killed them you probably have a decent outfit already). I spent about an hour getting a car and gearing up with my friend. After that, what do we do? Drive around the island waiting for something interesting to happen. Nothing did. This is a similar to most of my other experiences.\n\nJust my thoughts. All of these issues are addressable, but currently I'm just tired of wandering around, repetitively searching for supplies, preparing to fight, dieing, and starting all over again. There just isn't more to this game at this point. That being said, Fallout: New Vegas has finished downloading!

But the pvp is good fun.\nI have made many new friends playing this game, it's perhaps one of the most rewarding aspects about this game / the community.\n\nJoin a clan or make a clan, you will soon understand how powerfull playing as a team can be. Also all the extra things you can achieve, get upto.\n\nBase building is super fun. Build a massive base or a little cabin in the woods.\nAttack other bases or defend your own.\nWhen you join a clan, everyone can use each others base within the clan.\nFind guides to build a better base - Some are super rare, happy hunting.\n\nMutants, they can spawn just about anywhere on the map. They can be rather deadly in large groups, you can even call them over, if you have a mic (capslock). I rather enjoy this feature.\nI use this ability, when players are running after me. Soon they will start to follow them instead of me. Since they attack anything close to them first.\n\nWeapons: Guns (Shotgun , Rifles), Crossbow, melee weapons / crafted weapons, & many more.\nClothes: A insane amount of different types of clothes to loot. Matching sets ( Camo sets etc)\n\nVehicles: Many different types, use them to get from A-B, or run mutants / players over with them. Store items in them. Some vehicles can carry more players then others, did i mention you can blow vehciles up... hehe\n\nThe map is a decent size, so many amazing views to look at. From forest, to open fields... Towns & rivers. The Dev team have been working really hard to get this game looking stunning, & fun to play.\n\nUpdates / patches are rather frequent. I think "Miscreated" , is optimized rather well for a "Early Access / Alpha". The servers are stable. The only next logical step is this next part:\n\nClick add to cart...go go go. Then i can shoot you or we can look at someone else getting attacked or shot. "Eats popcorn" while they die, loots body...

The developers are really passionate about making this game (unlike the developers of DayZ who make their game worse with every update). Miscreateds environment is amazing. It feels like an apocalypse actually occured and you want to explore it to see all it has to offer. You can tell they were inspired by the Fallout series and this is probably as close as were going to get to a Fallout Online game. The player interactions are always fun and unpredictable and can lead to some crazy situations. Theres also tons to do. You can pvp, kill mutants, loots houses, trailers, buildings and more, craft weapons, build bases, fix up vehicles to drive and explore the map to find fallout shelters and caves. This game is worthy of your $20. So give it go, you won't regret it ;).\n\nI blew up my friend standing on some gas cannisters, then I caught on fire and became the human torch for like 20 minutes. 10/10 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GHbisZTqS4E","March 5","true","163.6"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"

Miscreated is on a very early stage, I highly recommend buying it but keep in mind it needs a lot of work for it to be in a playable condition. At the moment you only get like 2-3 hours before boredom. Maybe you got excited about the graphics but that's just cryengine in effect, you will realize that graphics performance plus server issues destroy your overall experience. At the moment you have only few items to loot, no grouping system, a pretty weak anti-cheat system and the zombies are kinda useless. What really hurts the game is the slow development team posting a minor patch now and then without any extra content.

The concept of the game and the motivation of the developpers did the rest and I purchased it.\nNow, after few die and retries, I'm positively surprised to still find new things to do. The randomisation of the equipement conditions your experience and makes it different each time. Once you'll find guns at once and look for a fight, another day it'll be harder and will have to craft your spiked plank.\nThe incoming content looks promising, the cooperation will be a must to achieve great things and carry the materials with your pickup to the construction site of your base.\nLast but not least, I think the game is more "friendly" than other games of this kind with simplified controls and UI.\n\nSo far, I didn't encounter any bug, unexpected death or inventory loss.

And the team strives to reach that potential by updating the game with more content on a well timed basis.\n\nYes, the game has its flaws such as connectivity issues, lack of certain gameplay elements and others. But you have to understand that it's still in Alpha. I'm not trying to use that as an excuse but it's a valid argument due to the fact that are about 14 people working hard to give you guys results.\n\nA lot of people have mentioned that there aren't a lot of things to do in the game -- but I've noticed that those reviews usually have less than 1 hour of gameplay.\n\nThe game definitely requires patience if you want to enjoy it. Finding loot isn't a chore as there's houses and buildings usually containing a few items here and there. The scenery of the game really makes exploring it worthwhile. Combat is pretty difficult but very thrilling. Definitely recommend teaming up with friends to take on other players. Mutants are scarce in some areas but thriving in others (such as Pinecrest or Sultan).\n\nTL;DR\n\nPlay the game but give it time; 2 hours or less isn't going to cut it.\nGet some friends or go solo, you'll face thrills either way.\nIf you don't want to get it now, at least be sure to keep an eye on it because a lot of features are\ngoing to be improved and implemented in the future.","June 15, 2015","true","319.0"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

What I like the most about the game is its love for the mapdesign. The mapdesign and all things with it is just so freaking awesome, I've never seen so much love for details in any of the other survival multiplayer games. It really feels like being in a postapocalyptic world. Houses are old, plants growing over the walls, textures are well done, with grafity of the last ones, rubbish glittering over floors and stuff... I think that is quite important to get the right impressions! The map is alrdy quite big too and they working on it and make it bigger from time to time. But it never feels like you walking from one point to another for ages like I have experienced in other survival games. The looting system is well done as well. You literally find things everywhere. You just have to search in particular to get things together.\n\nThe second I like very much ist the pvp part. You dont need to wait very long to get into decent pvp. There are 3 bigger towns and an airfield which is famous for its pvp. The weapon system still needs some work but it feels very well done already. The weapons are not that overpowered, especially the snipers, you really have to have a calm hand to hit somebody. Its not like in other games where snipers just laying in a hedges for hours and oneshot all the poor guys who trying to find loot and they actually dont know what just happened. Most of the time its more like, you hear a shot and quite quick you know you are under fire, so you rush into cover, a building or whatsoever... then the fun part begins. The moment you hear steps and you know somebody hostile wants you to be dead. Your heartbeat slowly increases. It can take a while after the actual fight starts because everybody know, If I loose this fight, I gotta start from scratch. Those moments can be so intense... I love it!\n\nThe third part is the basebuilding... holy ♥♥♥♥ it makes so much fun. You can build so beautiful shelter, little block houses, bases as little roadblocks or even really big forts where u store all your vehicles and in future the storage crates. You find your guides for the different parts and then you start to build your home, just the way you want it to look like. No predefined blocks. The basebuilding system is made a way that every base has its unique look.\n\nOverall I like the fact it is held pretty realistic. In groups you are really have to remember what your mates look like or he ends up friendly fired by yourself. There is no crosshair with any weapon which helps for aiming. To get vehicles going you need to find several parts, like drivebelts, oil, spark plagues ect. Mutants can be really dangerous if you dont care. First you start on the map you are really lost and no magic map is showing you where you actually are. So you gotta find out yourself what is where, where to go and so on...\n\nThe game itself being in an alpha state is already well done! Sure it has still tons of bugs and things to be made better in future, lot of features and content to implement into the game so its getting interesting for a long term fungame but the devs working on it and they let you know they do quite often.\n\nI think the game has a lot of potential and being said I was never a big fan of its genre, for this particular game I want to be a part of its development and would like to see how it turns out in the end. If devs keeping up the good work on it, it will blow a lot of poeples minds!!!","December 20, 2015","true","704.6"," 26 of 45 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","26","45","4","0"

Every house feels different despite similar models being reused. It plays like DayZ minus the gigantic map and with a slightly smaller player count in the servers. The UI is somewhat frustrating to fiddle with and the recently added weather features could definitely use some tweaking, but all in all it's a very fun game if you're into the DayZ style loot/survival game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pederh/recommended/299740/","pederh","Tcmi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pederh/","30 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview for Miscreated My rating:  9/10\nI want to start off by saying that Miscreated is better than any other open-world survival game that I know off.\nForget DayZ, forget Rust, forget H1Z1 because Miscreated is better in almost all aspects.\n\nThere isn't much backstory to the game, but it really doesn't need any at all. Here's the little story that is: The game is set in a world devastated by two nuclear wars. The radiation has left much of the population dead, and some have become sick and mutated.\nThats pretty much it.\nYou spawn in and you're free to raom the harsh but beautiful world. Currently the map is big, but not huge. You can walk across in about 15-20 mins, maybe less.\n\nLet's do some pros and cons\n\nPros:\nIt's beautiful. I have only played this on a laptop, but I could set the graphic settings to high without experiencing any problems. I could even do very high but then I could encounter a few preformance issues wich i would rather not. If you just have an ok gaming pc, you should be able to run this on very high all arround. Compared to DayZ, where I couldn't even play on medium to low without major preformance issues, this is amazing. The game is no less vizually rewarding than others in its genre.\n\nIt has working viechles. The game offers 6 working viechles. Altough they might need fixing when you find them arround the wrold. Some of the components that can be missing from viecles are: Wheels, drive belt, battery, oil, diesel, spark plugs and so on. These items can be found arround the map, often in garages an such.\n\nThe game  features 18 different weapons. 9 firearms and 9 melee weapons. These are scattered arround teh world, but personally i found most of my guns at the airfield, where I encountered a 5-ton truck filled with weapons.\n\nThe building mechanics in the game are apparently very good, and altough I haven't yet tried it out myself I'm listing this as a pro, merely because the game containes building.\n\nThere is an in game map that you can find, equip and use. If you don't happen to find any just go  Here [miscreated.wikia.com] and check it out.\n\nMy general player encounter has been good and bad therefore this is listed as both a pro, and con. The good people I've met have been nice and even rolepaying too. They have both been friendly and hostile, but they havn't opend fire without any reason like the ones I'll talk about in the con section.\n\nCrafting. I haven't really crafted much but it has potential to become even better than it is.\nCons:\nMutants. There are two different mutants in game, one that is basicly a regular peron gone mental, and one that has a spike for a hand. These are acctually quite rare, wich isn't necesarily a bad thing, but it would deffinatly raise the difficulty if they were more common. They can be kiled with 3 hits from an axe, but take 13 punches so don't fistfight them.\n\nPlayer encounters. Ovbiously there are no rules against killing, looting and such, but it would really make the game more enjoyable for all if people with good gear didn't just kill anyone on sight. But ovbiously in all games where it's allowed, there will always be people killing for the heck of it, so all in all, similar to the real world.\n\nInventory system. Now this isn't really a negative thing. Honestly there is nothing wrong with it. I just personally prefer a tetris-inventory were items take bigger place depending on how big they acctually are. This game does feature a weight system though, so you can't carry  everything you come across. Also backpacks aren't that common.\n\nPlayer glitch. This might just be me but I sometimes have problems viewing my players arms, legs and torso. this is only if I don't have clothes covering it up. My head and lower legs is usually visible. My friend didn't encounter the same issue and he saw my character without the glitch. this is a minor problem but kind of annoying when i had to tear my clothes to rags for healing and was left looking at a half-invisible charater for a while.\nI would stronly reccomend this game if you are tired of other half-♥♥♥♥♥ survival games. This is a game that provides great fun and a challenge. The devs updates it regularly.\nThis game gets a 9/10 from me. I am looking froward to see how it evolves in the future upon release.","April 23","true","34.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Some of the components that can be missing from viecles are: Wheels, drive belt, battery, oil, diesel, spark plugs and so on. These items can be found arround the map, often in garages an such.\n\nThe game  features 18 different weapons. 9 firearms and 9 melee weapons. These are scattered arround teh world, but personally i found most of my guns at the airfield, where I encountered a 5-ton truck filled with weapons.\n\nThe building mechanics in the game are apparently very good, and altough I haven't yet tried it out myself I'm listing this as a pro, merely because the game containes building.\n\nThere is an in game map that you can find, equip and use. If you don't happen to find any just go  Here [miscreated.wikia.com] and check it out.\n\nMy general player encounter has been good and bad therefore this is listed as both a pro, and con. The good people I've met have been nice and even rolepaying too. They have both been friendly and hostile, but they havn't opend fire without any reason like the ones I'll talk about in the con section.\n\nCrafting. I haven't really crafted much but it has potential to become even better than it is.\nCons:\nMutants. There are two different mutants in game, one that is basicly a regular peron gone mental, and one that has a spike for a hand. These are acctually quite rare, wich isn't necesarily a bad thing, but it would deffinatly raise the difficulty if they were more common. They can be kiled with 3 hits from an axe, but take 13 punches so don't fistfight them.\n\nPlayer encounters. Ovbiously there are no rules against killing, looting and such, but it would really make the game more enjoyable for all if people with good gear didn't just kill anyone on sight. But ovbiously in all games where it's allowed, there will always be people killing for the heck of it, so all in all, similar to the real world.\n\nInventory system. Now this isn't really a negative thing. Honestly there is nothing wrong with it. I just personally prefer a tetris-inventory were items take bigger place depending on how big they acctually are. This game does feature a weight system though, so you can't carry  everything you come across. Also backpacks aren't that common.\n\nPlayer glitch. This might just be me but I sometimes have problems viewing my players arms, legs and torso. this is only if I don't have clothes covering it up. My head and lower legs is usually visible. My friend didn't encounter the same issue and he saw my character without the glitch. this is a minor problem but kind of annoying when i had to tear my clothes to rags for healing and was left looking at a half-invisible charater for a while.\nI would stronly reccomend this game if you are tired of other half-♥♥♥♥♥ survival games. This is a game that provides great fun and a challenge. The devs updates it regularly.\nThis game gets a 9/10 from me. I am looking froward to see how it evolves in the future upon release.","April 23","true","34.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Great environment, chilling undead, and fun investing the area.  The not fun part is spending 1 hour getting gear and getting ganked by PVP players.

Which is great, because I really don't care for PVP. Not that I don't mind pvp games, but, when a server is listed as PVE it should be PVE.\nThe problem is that there are those out there that pretend to be friendly, you know push f2 to show hands raised or wave as if they are friendly, then when your back is turned they shoot and loot. This has happened to me multiple times on different pve servers. Since this game is very realistic with health dropping rapidly once you get shot there really isn't anything you can do but bleed out and start over, or become a raider yourself. The game really devolves into 2-4 man groups killing eachother for petty supplies, no matter which server you are on.\n\nGameplay is fantastic, but everyone becomes a hunter or the prey, don't kid yourself into thinking you can be friendly in this game.","April 25","true","31.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

If you are in to a survival experience, and want a true survival game, buy this game and support the developers.  Dont expect it to be a finished prodeuct, but just know that the guys working on this game know exactly what a true survival experience is, and they are doing it. They could easily conform to the masses and complete the BR mode to make more money, but they aren't. They are sticking to making a core survival experience at heart, and I love it.  The world is truely immersive and is the best looking post apocolyptic game you will play with overgrown houses, stores, and streets.\n\nDo youself a favor and give this game a buy to support its development.  Storage is coming soon, they just have to rework how the servers send and recieve info.  Go to Entrada Interactive on youtube and watch their video from 2-20-16.

But you've either got what it takes, or you haven't and Miscreated has it all. The graphics , the sound effects, even the weather effects, everything about this game is just so beautifully crafted to give you a fully immersive experience that will leave you wishing all games were developed with the Cryengine! (When the machines take over, they're going to use Cryengine to plug us into the Matrix, mark my words.. You won't know the difference!).\n\nEdit: I need to add to my original review, that the KoS in this game is exactly if not worse than DayZ. It's getting boring already, there's no fun in being KoS'd by the ONLY other player on the server.  Once you've been KoS'd a few times in a game like this, it just turns into a grind each time you have to respawn (it took hours each time for me), spend a few hours gearing up, get kos'd, rinse, repeat .. Honestly though, I still love this game, the devs work hard at keeping it fresh and it's still way ahead of DayZ Standalone and the likes. Just wish it would attract a more mature (or just old school bandit, if that's your thing) type of player!\n\nIf you don't like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t KoS kiddy mentality of DayZ , then don't buy this game (the island is too small to avoid bumping into each other, even when there's only 2 of you on), KoS seems to be a part of this gaming genre these days! You can't escape it!\n\nDefinately a game you play with a clan for protection, but as a solo PVE experience? No.\n\nWhen I play games like this (with rampant KoS) I start to lose faith in humanity! Because when it boils down to it,  these games prove that in a world without law or order, the majority of people are just nasty ♥♥♥♥♥!

This is what DayZ should have been. Game is beautifal and runs very smoothly. I have a middle-low end computer and did not experience any lag or frame drop even when going into big towns running on Nvidia Gforce GTX 555 4g. Base building has just been introduced I havent tried it yet and there are a few vehichles you can drive around. My first play through I was beat to death by 2 bandits while looting. AI mutants arent the smartest thing but I'm sure they will be improved over time. The weather system is amazing! I first joined in the middle of what seemed like a hurricane storm. I could barely see anything and the rain effects were amazing! Players are active aswell. I had no problem finding a high population server. Max players right now is 36 i think. The detail put into all the structures aswell is great. You definately feel like your looting through a ravaged post apocolyptic map complete with bone piles and "RUN OR DIE!" graffiti everywhere. Only problem I had was finding ammo. Found a total of 3 pistols the entire time and only 1 mag for 1 of them. This is after looting the airfield there. It really puts stress on wether to use your bullets or not.

I acidently drop the tshirt with my army jacket in it, the tshirt dissapear with my army jacket. Last night we couldnt log in the game because of poor internet connection, tonight I log on our cars that we had is gone, the thing about the respawn of cars is not cool, u work your ♥♥♥ of to find all the parts and the car just just to loose it to some jerk we wants to steal it or it totaly dissapear if u dont log on in time. This game is about realism but in real life cars have keys so u should only loose ownership on death of a vehicle. The content of a vehicle should only be accesible by yourself and your clan that is realistic. Cars dont explode when hit by 2 shotguns hits, cars are to weak when it comes to peope or raiders shooting at it. Maybe a tire can blow or tank get a hole and it leaks fuel but cars dont explode when u shoot at it in real life it only explode in movies. Loot that falls on the ground dont just dissapear in front of your eyes in real life and also u dont eat like a pig in real life like these avatars needs food and drinks u barely start building your base and u have to run off to go search for food because we realy need storages.","May 23","true","90.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

They have said storage is coming.\n\nDon't be put off too much though, the game is still excellent without storage, for some of the following reasons:\nThe graphics are superb\nThe game is logical - you find more food in kitchens for example\nVehicles are fun to drive...a truck going downhill on it's rims (no tyres) makes for a very interesting slippy experience!

Civilization is taking a Breather in 2089, anyone left alive and unmutated is just focused on staying that way, Survival of the Fittest.\n\nGame Play Miscreated shows basic gameplay, however encounters with other players gets your heart pounding then you are left with a decision on whether to trust them or not and this is where Miscreated shines its brightest with the social interaction between other players. The Mutants need some work but now cause some chaotic interactions with the new AI they were given. Loot is rare and gives you a sensation when you find that handcrafted pistol hidden underneath a table. The character you play as handle's surpisingly stable, however due to the game being in alpha the controls can be buggy at some points throughout the game.\n\nIn Game Graphics The graphics in Miscreated are incredible, whether its from shining your flashlight into windows, watching the sun shine brightly over the hills or walking into houses with fascinating overgrowth. CryEngine makes Miscreated one of a kind and well worth investing into it's alpha.\n\nSound  Miscreated currently doesn't have an in-game soundtrack but it does have a beautiful melodic main menu theme song.\nMiscreated also uses it's in game sound effects as a tension builder throughout the game.\n\nPro's And Con's  + Heart pounding gameplay\n+ Amazing in-game graphics\n+ Not much k.o.s\n+ Base Building\n+ Constant Updates\n\n- under-populated servers\n- Bugs\n\nConclusion  Miscreated works very well as an alpha and is well worth $20.00. We all need to work together as a community and expand Miscreated's playerbase, as Miscreated has the potential of being something huge!","May 8","true","56.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

(im pretty sure this will change upon release.\n\n- Cannot host your own server, i wish this would change, probably get more people interested in the product but i think that is why there are no hackers for now.\n\n- The gunshots sound like ♥♥♥♥\n\nVerdict\n-------\n\nYes i recommend the game, it works better than dayz and H1Z1 imo.\n\nThis flew under my radar at first for a while, plus de publicity doesnt look amazing and looks more like a dayz clone than anything but believe me its well worth it. Dev's, change the miscreated logo and store front and get this game seen by more people because this is great work.\n","February 21","true","83.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

Civilization is taking a Breather in 2089, anyone left alive and unmutated is just focused on staying that way, Survival of the Fittest.\n\nGame Play Miscreated shows basic gameplay, however encounters with other players gets your heart pounding then you are left with a decision on whether to trust them or not and this is where Miscreated shines its brightest with the social interaction between other players. The Mutants need some work but now cause some chaotic interactions with the new AI they were given. Loot is rare and gives you a sensation when you find that handcrafted pistol hidden underneath a table. The character you play as handle's surpisingly stable, however due to the game being in alpha the controls can be buggy at some points throughout the game.\n\nIn Game Graphics The graphics in Miscreated are incredible, whether its from shining your flashlight into windows, watching the sun shine brightly over the hills or walking into houses with fascinating overgrowth. CryEngine makes Miscreated one of a kind and well worth investing into it's alpha.\n\nSound  Miscreated currently doesn't have an in-game soundtrack but it does have a beautiful melodic main menu theme song.\nMiscreated also uses it's in game sound effects as a tension builder throughout the game.\n\nPro's And Con's  + Heart pounding gameplay\n+ Amazing in-game graphics\n+ Not much k.o.s\n+ Base Building\n+ Constant Updates\n\n- under-populated servers\n- Bugs\n\nConclusion  Miscreated works very well as an alpha and is well worth $20.00. We all need to work together as a community and expand Miscreated's playerbase, as Miscreated has the potential of being something huge!","May 8","true","56.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This is very much like Day Z. I jumped right in and felt at home quickly. It's not much better than Day Z but also not much worse, just slightly different. The animations are certinally better than Day Z but it has draw backs like not being able to switch weapons/ view/ turn flashlight on or off (or do anything really) while running; you have to stop running to do all those things, which can be a pain in the a** when you'er getting shot at. Graphics are what you would expect for a $20 alpha. Most of the screen shots on steam look enhanced.\n\n\nIt's fun though.

Even with a map 1/4th the size of DayZ's it still feels very expansive in it's current state, and even Miscreated being an Early-Access release it plays with minimal bugs for me.

This game does not deserve mixed reviews as this game is like h1z1 but with way better devs more time spent into it less bugs crashes its amazing. I don't really pointing out downfalls in early development games but if you are wondering the only things ive had trouble with is the combat system needs just a little work its hard to shoot people who are running at you with bats moving constantly but maybe that adds some kind of balance I have had no experiences with crashes a few obvious bugs but the game is in great shape and im sure they are working on those as you read this If you're in to true survival the suspence in a combat situation after working hard to find loot then this is the game for you ignore other reviews as childs and other people tend to review after a tramatic experience with a bug or combat loss and tend to be salty I see nothing wrong with this game so far and it only gets better.","February 13","true","7.5"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","0"

And I was dragged into this one by my friend. Hes played these kind of things before but when I saw "mixed" I wasnt sold. How wrong I was. This game is getting better and better, and when you actually read/watch the Dev Streams and see what they have planned its not going to be long before the other survivalist fans come flocking. Yes, there are bugs, the AI is a bit weak but after listening to the Dev stream they have an external company working on this, and before long this will be a polished product. So much more to come in, like Hunting, campfires, you name it!\n\nI payed £7 odd for this on sale, but even at full price it is more than your bang for buck.\n\nThe Visuals are spectacular, I have never quite seen anything like it before, the lighting is superb, id even go as far as to say that theyre the best visuals I have seen implemented into a game. Im only running them on High not even the max. They've paid so much attention to the small things, like when you walk through a muddy puddle the noises change, its all very well thought out!\n\nThe community as I have heard, is more "friendly" than others, but I have never played other survival games so couldnt tell you. But dont get me wrong, there are still douches out there who will shoot on sight, so dont trust too easy!\n\nIf youve got a group of friends who like this kind of thing then youre on to a winner, sticking in teams is always more fun, and the base building would be even better with friends!\n\nYou will spend most of your time avoiding other players out of sheer terror when you actually have decent loot. Your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ will constantly be going like a rabbits nose. You will know no pain than when youre bleeding out, and looting frantically to find some sort of bandage or rag when youve ripped all your clothes up to heal your wounds. Or on the other hand, being one tapped by god knows who when you finally found your first rifle...\n\nAll in all, its a solid 9/10 for me and would recommend to anyone - do not look at the "mixed" review and skip!!!!\n","February 26","true","26.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I can't comment on these as I only bought the game about 3 weeks ago and have roughly 30 hours in game. I really like this game and have had alot of fun playing it. Having played Dayz Standalone, Rust, H!Z! and just about every other zombie apocolypse / survivial game out there I can honestly say this is my favourite and the one I would recommend to others to get into the genre. This game really stands apart from others, it looks beautiful, has alot of features already in the game and has so much potential. Add to that an active Dev team with regular updates / announcements / telling us what the plan is and you have a very solid early access game. Zombies , PvP, PvE, Basbuilding, Crafting and more to come, I would definately recommend this game.","March 4","true","37.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've put a really okay amount of time into DayZ. It's sad to say but with only 4 hours into this game so far it's already better. Nothing will beat the times I have had in DayZ but this game captures the genre very well. It did what all the other "Sur-zombie Games" couldnt do. Capture the feel of how a desolate world with some sort of viral aftermath should have.\n\nWhen going in looting it feels scary, it feels distant, and you will feel alone.\n\nIt looks good.

I have never played the stand alone version of Day Z as people warned me off buying that due to nothing being updated in it, and it taking a turn for the worse or being somewhat broken.\n\nThis game, while still in Alpha as I write this, is giving me those addictive nostalgic feelings from when Day Z was actually good, plus it has more stuff in it (base building/crafting).\n\nThe developers actually seem to care about this, and release regular updates/fixes.    It looks to be going in a really good direction.\n\nTLDR:  If you enjoyed Arma II Day Z mod, you'll love this to bits.","March 1","true","537.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

First off I must say this game is huge. It runs fairly well and framerates have gotten better. The new lightning/fog mechanics give a greater ambience to the game. Visually it is more appealing then other survival horrors.  Basebuilding is fun yet simple. Weapons are hard to come by as they should be. Crafting has gotten alot better.  The flashlight along with night time adds another element to the game.\n\n\n\nOne thing I will say is how the car/vehicle mechanics work. The fact that all cars start with nothing in them is a bit of a pain. Finding one tire on the map let alone four is quite the task. Perhaps the cars should spawn with all tires and add a mechanic that enables the tires to be shot and blown out. In a nut shell, I ended up spending four hours looking for car supplies and ended up with 2 tires and spark plugs, half a tank of gas, battery and and oil. Point is it took me far too long to the point where I just wanted to give up. I still to this point have yet to get in a working vehicle and have only encountered 2 and a handful of bicycles which were recently added.\n\nAnother thing, which im sure has been mentioned and will be addressed is the Mutant rate/AI.  They have gotten alot better but are honestly almost do not exist in the game. Its to a point where I do not even fear them. Perhaps make them a bit tougher and have a better range of sight. Make them run the same speed as the survivors that way they are more cautious around them instead of simply running by knowing they wont catch them. I have actually seen a few players run around purposely having them chase them collecting several (5-10) and make a game out of it. While comical, I don't think the Mutant's AI were made as a joke.\n\nAll in all, this game has alot of promise and I enjoy what has become of it in the early development. The sky is the limit, Kudos the developers for sticking to it. Will continue to play. I baught a 4 pack for myself and friends so I am hoping convince them to continue giving Miscreated a chance.\n\n8/10\n\n","May 3","true","24.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I have 300 hours on h1z1 and 400 on DayZ. This game is much more playable then either one. If you're looking for a zombie survival game. This is it.

The performance is great and the graphics are absolutely beautiful everything is really screenshot worthy. The only con is it is a Early access game. Which means bugs and incomplete features. But honestly. With that being Said it us very playable. Lastly, the community. Its great.

They have gotten alot better but are honestly almost do not exist in the game. Its to a point where I do not even fear them. Perhaps make them a bit tougher and have a better range of sight. Make them run the same speed as the survivors that way they are more cautious around them instead of simply running by knowing they wont catch them. I have actually seen a few players run around purposely having them chase them collecting several (5-10) and make a game out of it. While comical, I don't think the Mutant's AI were made as a joke.\n\nAll in all, this game has alot of promise and I enjoy what has become of it in the early development. The sky is the limit, Kudos the developers for sticking to it. Will continue to play. I baught a 4 pack for myself and friends so I am hoping convince them to continue giving Miscreated a chance.\n\n8/10\n\n","May 3","true","24.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Just buy it now. The Developers are making great progress.  This game is Beautiful, and the PVP is intense.  There are PLENTY of server choices so if you dont like a server. Try a different one.  For an early access game this game really hits the bar.  Everything DayZ Standalone should have been and so much more.  Its early access so yeah there are some bugs, but nothing gamebreaking that ive encountered. Judging based on an Early Development title against other Early Access games on steam ive played this is a solid 8/10.","June 3","true","7.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Anyways this is the most well put together, realistic, massive multiplayer game out there! H1Z1 was an atrocious survival game like no one has room to disagree because it turned into a stupid deathmatch game for crying out loud....DayZ Standalone is good but has too many OP weapons, but Miscreated now is a game that makes you feel like you're really in an apocalypse. The houses in miscreated are all different and have vegetation and wear all on and INSIDE the houses, every house and i mean EVERY house varies like its incredible how much work they put into the houses unlike in H1Z1 and DayZ. Next is the weapons. Yes, there aren't many weapons but there are some weapons that actually might be found in towns like a simple hand gun or beaten winchester or huniting rifle (which is super rare), ammo is super hard to find like it really would be in real life which helps lower the D-Bags in the game and really makes people want to make a group instead of kill on sight.

The graphics are nearly as beautiful as my Elizabeth.  They have a small but dedicated development team, (so things can seem a bit slow going for updates) but you can bet your ♥♥♥ they are churning out code as fast as they can.  Grouping is a must in this game, if you go in solo to a server that is marked PVP...expect to die alot.  Find a pve server and make some friends or go it alone and try to make as many friends as you can, so you can group up and stay alive.  The map is quite large (64 sq miles I believe), even though you can "fix" trucks and other vehicles up, expect to run almost everywhere.  You may find the occasional bike, which makes you a sitting duck to anyone that actually sees you on it.  The weather can play a huge factor in the game, as can the day/night cycle (which can be very frustrating if you spawn fresh in the dark near mutants or zombies).  Getting into a firefight in this game is pretty intense, especially if you have a loadout of great weapons (if you die, you lose everything).  If you like Survial Horror/PVP/Crafting, then check it out.","May 29","true","97.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

All in all I would recommend this game for people looking for an immersive and challenging survival game. The Dev team has a good head on their shoulders and they have big plans for the game. If they say that something is going to be put into the game. They put it into the game. No false promises with this team. Moving forward with this game there is massive potential. I played over 2,000hours in H1Z1 and had enough of Daybreaks big promises and under delivering of content. I enjoy playing Miscreated far more than H1Z1 and an added bonus. I've yet to encouter a hacker in this game which is great. One of the biggest cons in the game right now (2/18/16) is there is no storage. BUT it's coming very soon along with new AI.

I accidentally fell from the top of a very small gas station and hurt myself to 75% health. My health kept going down to 0% and I died. I had tons of food, a gun, a hoodie, a military backpack and water carrier, and great clothing. Not sure what that was about, shouldn't have died from one fall that barely hurt me by itself. Otherwise, it's a great game, pick it up.\n\nEDIT: Disregard my review above, I'm new to these types of games and didn't realize this was common. However, since this is a survival game, I do recommend to any devs that are reading this to make food and water less common. Very easily to stockpile both and get bored and start PKing, would be much more tense if I also had to worry about not dying from starvation and dehydration.","February 18","true","102.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","6"

You can easily see how the dev team has taken the best parts of most survival games and are working on a true peice of art. I really see my self playing this game for hours and hours. The only set back this game has to me is a smaller dev team. Now dont get me wrong the devs are great but, when you have a small team updates can be a little bit slower.

The graphics are nicer/better optimized, there are only a few bugs so far, great to play with friends, can be ♥♥♥♥ scary at times, yet fun at the same time. Overall the game is great! My only niggles that i have about the game is that you cannot create a private server, the game is server based (long load/server join times), the mutants/zombies are OP...awaaaay OP and you can only use/repair certain vehicles.

I can play on high settings with a rock solid 60FPS.\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nIn addition to the beautiful lighting/visuals, there's also tons of small details throughout the map that make it look even better.  Rats and flies around trash, birds flying around while chirping, etc.  Some things (rats, car tires) need animations but even without them they look great.  Distant objects could use a little work, though.\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nWhile it may be in early stages, it still has more than most other survival games have.  There aren't too many mutants, but also not too little - the difficulty is just right.  The looting system could use a bit more work, making it easier to tell if something is lootable could help since it's easy to walk past something.  Gunplay feels really smooth, first and third person modes look great, and the gameplay itself is just fun.\n\n\nThings I don't like:\n- Server browser could use some work, same goes for the menus in general.  Server browser needs favorites and histoy tabs to make finding previous servers easy, and maybe bump up the font size a bit. The inventory is perfectly fine, though.\n- Lack of players.  This game isn't dead, there's always servers with ~20 people on, but there could always be some more people, which isn't exactly the developers fault, just the lack of people being aware of this game.  The community is really nice, though.\n- Lack of mutant/zombie/whatever variety.  This isn't really major but should be adressed later on.\n\ntl;dr: If you want a solid survival game that runs really well while looking beautiful, this is the way to go.  Developers are really active with the community and seem really nice, while playerbase is small it isn't toxic.

Instead I'll write about my second play through (because I died pretty quick by bleeding out the first time)\n\nI began in the middle of nowhere, literally. I ran through a forest for about ten fifteen minutes, and just when I thought I would die from thirst, I found a small village. Armed with nothing but my flashlight (which you will need at night) I began exploring this small village.\nAfter searching a couple of houses, I really felt like this was a world that had ended, people had clearly lived in these houses at some point. From the photographs on the walls to the leaking toilets and the childrens bedrooms.\nAs i observed the wallpaper peeling from the walls and struggled to find any decent still edible food, I heard a groan outside.\nGrabbing some dog food i slowly approached the outside of the house i was in, and after looking around for a while I saw it.\nA mutant.\nFeeling safe, I decided to try and sneak by into the next house, hoping to find a weapon.\nThe mutant heard my footsteps on the grass and ran after me, so i started to flee.\nIn a panic i could hear its footsteps behind me slowly fade and upon turning around could see the mutant walking away back towards the village.\nI followed slowly and quietly and explored some more houses.\nOne house i went in had a couch completely covered in blood with a skeleton lying on the floor. What happened here?\nI went up the stairs, found a change of clothes and some antibiotics, along with a bag to carry more stuff and a beanie hat to keep my head warm.\nI went into the attic where I found a rifle and a few rounds.\nYes, now it was safe to go outside and confront the mutant.\nNO IT WASN'T.\nAfter shooting the mutant and missing the headshot, it ran at me. I pumped another round into its face and it dropped lifeless in front of me.\nOh crap, I was hungry and thirsty, time to eat and drink.\nI barely got chance to consume the little food I had picked up when I heard more sounds. More mutants where coming.\nThe gunshot had attracted them, before I could figure out where to run it was too late, I died.\nThis was my first hour or two experiencing the game, and I hadnt even came accross a real life player yet.\nIt was a very tense experience to say the least, and really felt like a post apocalyptic world, from as little as the odd flashing light to the ability to repair cars after finding parts and building bases, this is the game I would recommend, over dayz any day.\nThe graphics are beautiful too.\n\nI ran this on an AMD A10 processor with integrated radeon r7 graphics, so not even a graphics card in my machine at the minute. It ran perfectly fine on medium settings and even with some settings turned to high, If you want it to run with everything on extra high without a little lag you may need a half decent graphics card though.\n\nI highly recommend this game, and with it constantly improving, I can not wait to see what else the developers have in store.\n\nThe best advice I can give is ignore any reviews and try it yourself, of course it isn't perfect with it still being early access...... but it isn't far off.\n\noh, and don't get comfortable thinking you're safe, you are never safe.","February 17","true","92.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Not sure why it has mixed reviews. I have 300 hours on it at this point and plan to have many more. Every time I play I run into a heart pounding situation. Like literally, heart pounding. The graphics and lighting are top notch. The map is a good size, and is getting bigger. The patches come out frequently, and are quite sizable.\n\nAnd the combat is so gritty.\n\nThe base building! It's awesome. You start off with basic crafting. And you can find more recipes to create more advanced things. For instance, I can make a small generator that powers 5 flood lights. The Devs say they are going to be adding more stuff to power as well.\n\nThere are vehicles in game and to get them going you need to repair them. Tires, fuel, oil, spark plugs, drive belt, battery. It's pretty rewarding when you get one going and can rip around with your buddies.\n\nI've tried lots of other survival games and this one is the first and only one that has me hopelessly addicted :D","November 16, 2015","true","699.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

Just want a good survival MMO where i don't feel like i'm playing another vurtual life (DayZ) some future galactic PvP game with minor obsticals with extreme hit ranges and required DLC [hacks] that gives you aimbot and wallhacks to create a hack off (Infestation Survivor Stories) Or where the enemies are extemely OP and can 3 hit all the way to a 1 hit and teleport behind and too you from miles away, and almost every time you come in contact with one you take at a minimum of 1 hit from them. The only way to obtain items is by killing them, and trading the drops to weapons because the spawns of weapons is so rare (Nether)\n\n-So far i'm extremely impressed with this game. I recomend the game completely "So far". For the game only being a few days old i'm already impressed with the game. I see so much potential in them and the game! My biggest worry are the hackers. That's what ruins every survival game and i don't want that to happen. I would just suggest stacking anti hacks on top of anti hacks to keep the game  as safe as possible. This is my first and probably some what only semi legit review i have ever done and probably my last. But Survival games are my number one thing. I'm really enjoying this game. I do recommend the game, BUT i would wait at least a week and read reviews of get imput from those that have it and see if they still think you should buy it. Because for $25 you're not really getting much right now. Yes you get to play through the game as it comes a long. But i would make sure the game comes a long well and the devs are not messing around.

My buddy and I both spawned after a wipe.\n\nI go and loot the military base, but I find nothing great.\n\nBut I did see a Truck with 4 wheels, and a battery. Hmm, this could be good. I tell my buddy about it.\n\nSo I go to meet up with my buddy at Sultan, and we go back to the Military Base to fix up the truck, my buddy had a Spark Plug, and Oil, but no Diesel Fuel.\n\nOn the way to the Military Base, we find a player inside a house. We try robbing him but he didn't talk. My buddy shot him with a Wasteland .22 I gave him. He had Diesel Fuel on him, great! Now we can finish fixing the truck.\n\nWhile we approched the Military Base, we heard someone. We didn't know where he was. It sounded like he was speaking Spanish.\n\nWe ran for the truck, and on the way my buddy saw him up on a watch tower. He didn't shoot.\n\nWe get to the truck and start fixing it, but an armed player comes along. My buddy tries holding him up but he just runs away. Probably got scared because there were 2 of us.\n\nAnyway, we fix the truck, and drive away from the Military Base, and hear the Spanish guy saying something.\n\nWe stop and loot some houses, and while we are looting them, I say: "I bet someone is going to come here and take the truck without noticing me in the 2nd seat."\n\nWe laugh at the possibility of having that happen, but no way that could happen... right?\n\nWe continue driving and reach a small, familiar, street. A few months ago, my buddy, another player, and I had a working truck and were ambushed at this very street. I died, the truck exploded, but my buddy killed the 2 players who ambushed us.\n\nI said "I bet we are going to get ambushed right here and a guy will take the truck."\n\nNo way that could happen... right?\n\nSo my buddy begins looting the houses, and then the engine of the truck starts up.\n\nDid I ever say I left the truck?\n\nSomeone else got into the truck and started driving, with me in the 2nd seat.\n\nJust like I said.\n\nThe player who got into the truck ran over my buddy and kept driving.\n\nSo I start talking to him.\n\nI say "Hey" and we start talking. Just driving around casually.\n\nHe was actually a really nice guy... for a thief.\n\nWhile we are driving he tells me that he is going to drive the truck off a cliff.\n\nOn the way, we come across 2 players.\n\nHe ran them over.\n\nThen he drove the truck into a river, not off a cliff, but hey that works.\n\nI swim out of the water onto land and head towards the 2 squashed players.\n\nThe guy then comes out of the water, and shoots at me.\n\nHe missed a lot of shots, and I took out my Wasteland .22\n\nI shot him once, then I ran out of ammo charging at him with a knife.\n\nI died.\n\nTHE END\n","July 9, 2015","true","25.4"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","60","12","20","15","2"

I have spent 12 hours in this game and it has potential. Its a mix between H1Z1, DayZ Standalone, Rust, and the Epoch Mod for the Arma games.\n\nMy big complaint is the size of the map. Small, when you think about it. I am use to a huge open world game, like Arma and H1Z1. This being said, its still big. I do not play on have very populated server, so running into people is slim.\n\nAnother slight negative, for some, is no names. When you see someone, there are no icons/names, so knowing if they are friend or foe is hard. Also, when you die/kill, there is no mention of it. You will never know if someone was killed near you or if you killed someone.\n\nLoot is properly randomized and spread out. Guns are rare to come across, tools, bullets, equipment and backpacks are next, then food and cloths are easy to find.\n\nCrafting is nice, but still slim. You get a basic crafting set, then must find books to read to learn new crafting items. These books are rare.\n\nRealism is nice in this. You really need to pay attention and properly focus on your surroundings or you will miss alot.\n\nGame is also eriely quiet. I play with speakers and have the sound turned up, but I still cannot hear everything until its upon me. Makes for some poop my pants moments.\n\nThe devs seem to be alive and ocntinue to improve the game, so if you like the games I mentioned above and prefer a game that brings alot of realism to it, then buy this game.","February 22","true","15.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yes, their are several CONS to the game but it has a lot of PROS also! the graphics in game are amazing. When you see a thunderstorm and you see the lightning strikes and hear the thunder right behind it and it makes you jump just a little, makes for a good game in my eyes! The mutants in the game will also make you jump when they catch you off guard ( checking your bags, moving things around in your vehicles etc... ) and its pretty intense needless to say lol... but some of the things i dislike so far are the fact that when you die, you LOSE EVERYTHING. Yes i mean everything.... Things that are in your vehicle, your inventory etc...\n\nBut, like i said this game is a must have and i really hope that the devs stay with this game and get some more of the updates to us in a good timely manner! i think things like a compass on the HUD would be a nice plus. getting the storages fixed ASAP also more storage space or something in your inventory would be quite nice also. i served 11 yrs in the military and i know i can carry more than 40kg for quite some time. so please do something with that also! but on the up and up this game is a MASTERPIECE in the making.... keep it up","April 21","true","26.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawdogmeat4/recommended/299740/","rawdogmeat4","rawdogmeat4","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rawdogmeat4/","1181 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI'm 3 hours into this, so I'll update this review as I go, and I'm sorry that it'll be long, but I felt this needed to be said even with my short playtime already. I dove into this game with my brother, both fully aware that this game is a DayZ clone by no doubt, and that's part of the reason we enjoyed it all the more.\n\nWhat I believe should be noted is that this DayZ clone that is Miscreated is more polished, and runs better than DayZ itself (Mod and standalone as I've played both) in every way possible. It may not be perfect, but the character movement, the camera changing, and the interface itself is smoother in its short progress than the awkward/clunkiness that DayZ has in the 3 years the standalone has been out, and however many years the DayZ mod has been out.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is... This game does DayZ better than DayZ.\n\nPROS:\n\nStructure-building (If you survive long enough, a base is nice)\n\nItem-crafting - Finding books around gives you more crafting recipes to learn. Still not sure if you keep them when you die.\n\nSalvageable vehicles to drive (Forget the pickup, we found a bike!)\n\nHouse-to-house looting just like DayZ (Feels like more buildings are available)\n\nNo need for can openers to dive into those sweet, juicy canned pears.\n\nWeather effects are some of the most beautiful I've ever seen in a game. Specifically when it starts thundering; it was so impressive, I thought it was actually thundering at my house it sounded so good. The rain started falling, forming small puddles on the ground with little reflections in them and it was breathtaking to see that good of development put into weather effects. Beautiful.\n\nHowever, with all good things that come, we have to accept the bad as well. Miscreated as great as it is does not display absolute perfection in its current Early Access stage, and here's some examples as to why:\n\nCONS:\n\nMutants (instead of zombies) aren't near as populated, so more PVP-focused (I consider this a good thing, but most wouldn't since it is a survival apocalypse, so I listed it as a con), but when you find them, boy are they a challenge as it takes 3-4 swings with my hatchet to kill one, and I'm at half health by the end of it.\n\nStructure-crafting feels a little too extreme on materials that are too difficult to find (If I can barely survive players as it is, how am I gonna gain all these misc materials to build a boxed hut?)\n\nIn some instances, the survivor aspect isn't as much there food-wise because we came across two towns full of houses that we found an endless supply of food; so much food in fact that we started eating some just for the hell of it in order to make room in our backpacks for more. I know guns themselves are more scarce, but why am I finding 9mm/10mm/357 rounds for guns I don't have more than for my little .22 pistol?\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nIs it worth it? Yes, if you liked the concept of DayZ, but want a more polished/enjoyable experience. I bought the 4-pack 50% off for $32, and that's cheaper than one copy of DayZ for $35. More worthwhile for me, personally. However, if you didn't like the DayZ experience at all and prefer something different, I'd avoid this one then as it's an attempt at the same genre, but better.\n\nEDIT: Added Pro about weather effects and added detail about item crafting as well as adding a sort of Pro under the Con list of Mutants. Along with that, added a Con about food being more plentiful than necessary compared to the amount of guns/ammo you find.","April 21","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Any little thing that I saw that wasn't great I hated. But coming back to this game after that six month break (Because I got the game and didn't play much of it because of everything I hated) I realized how much effort was put into this game and how beautiful the game world really is. And I also realized that I did not want to like this game because I did not want it to be better than DayZ. But it is. Now I guess you can label me as a "DayZ Guy" because it is one of the most played games on my account, but just playing this game for 4 hours I already had way more fun then the 148 hours I have on DayZ at the moment. If you are a fan of survival games than you NEED to get Miscreated. It gets updated rather often which is what we all want when it comes to survival games. But there is one con to this game in my opinion. And that is the crafting system. It's just very inconvenient and difficult to use. Other than that you will fall in love with this game very quickly if you just appreciate what the game is now and what it will be in the future.","March 1","true","32.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The environment is beautiful, textures, shading, etc. and I havent run into any bugs thus far. There's no voice chat so its pretty much KOS for most people. There's a lot of potentional in this game and I would suggest picking it up at some point. I think at $25 its a steep price atm, but with a few updates it will be worth it.","November 5, 2014","true","4.6"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

It's similar to Day Z, but is more consistant with updates since it is still in Alpha. I won't give it a rating at the moment, because there's a lot of bugs to work out and I'd like to give the Devs a bit more time to squash them. Overall, this game has a ton of potential.\n\nHere's a quick description...\n\nYou'll pick a server and spawn in with a flashlight and some clothes. First, you'll want to find clothes, food, water, weapons, etc. After that, you'll have some fun crafting and building bases, fixing up trucks to drive around, and encountering other survivors who will either be friendly or murder you on the spot for your stuff. Join up with them or take the other route.\n\nThe game gets really fun when you have friends to help collect items, raid, and build bases. There's definately safety in numbers. You'll also be dodging mutants both day and night, but it's the other survivors you should be worried about. To say the least, interesting things can happen when you run into other people in the local town. Exploration is a big part of Miscreated as well. The current map is massive and it's easy to get lost. If you die, you'll lose everything and spawn again. It's brutal, but it's part of the game's charm. You have to survive and defend yourself to keep what you've earned.\n\nOn the negative side, you'll run into a lot of bugs and glitches. Also, if you're a stickler for graphics, they might not meet all expectations, but it's a very satisfactory visual experience. As I stated before, it's still in alpha, so I'm definately watching this game to see where it goes.\n\nSo, would I recommend? Yes, but only for those who are open to experimental games. It's a lot of fun and I can enjoy playing this for a few hours on end with friends. Pick it up while it's on sale or check out one of the many giveaways.\n\nAlso, visit my page to read my Miscreated diary, where hilarity ensues when people encounter other people and injure them severly.

I like where this game is going and would definatly recommend this game to anyone who is seeking for a similar concept to DayZ, in fact; I enjoy this more than DayZ, which in my opinion is dead in the water and can not be revived unless it's picked up by another company. I give this game at it's current time an 8/10 because of the missing features which should have been in here from day dot.

I know the game is still on alpha but for an alpha fase game, it blows my mind away. Hope everyithing go the right way and the game gaines more popularity by its awesome overall.

Everything is very detailed, and feels optimized as I haven't seen any drops in FPS.  It was worth the price just for exploration.  You can find games with bigger worlds, but this one doesn't have the huge expanses of nothing that you need to travel through just to get anywhere.  So, while it is smallish, it doesn't feel that way.\nThere are what look to be mutants instead of zombies, and they seem to travel in packs.  I've encounted a couple, and was brought down to 20% health with a couple of hits, so it does teach you respect early on.\nLoot seems easy to find, though I haven't seen a huge variety of items.\nThe big thing was that the people who play seemed a bit nicer than in other games.  You still get your banditry, but I've only had one KOS experience in the few days I've been playing, which is a big difference from H1Z1.\nIf you're on the fence on this one, I'd say go for it.  I've had it on my wishlist for months and when I finally got it, I was pleasantly surprised.","June 17, 2015","true","14.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I've played the Game quite a lot and this still impresses me. The environments can look amazing, like mentioned, particularly the Foliage and this Game really does a good job at selling over-grown/abandoned areas and it does it 100x better than Games like H1Z1 where environments just look flat and lifeless.\n\nThe bad:\n\nAt longer ranges, this stuff basically just goes away as due to LOD stuff foliage etc doesn't look that great (models like fences etc also fade out at distance meaning that someone hiding behind and object at range may think they were hidden but would be being seen by people a far distance off) other systems like the loot system and AI are also for a lack of a better word, bland.\n\nAI:\n\nIn their current state glitchy, annoying and just un-fun to fight, they really don't add anything to the Game and the actual chracter models/design I find quite boring (imagine the Mutants from I am Ledgend but with a gigantic Spike for an arm) there's also Wildlife (like Deer/Squirrels etc) but these are just stock Cry-Engine assets/systems the developers have thrown in and don't really serve any other function than looking nice.\n\nOptimization:\n\nQuite bad TBH. I can run the Game at an ok Framerate with stuff turned down (hovers at around 30fps) with what I would call a semi-decent Computer (i5 4670k, GTX 770, 8GB Ram) but overtime the longer you play it just seems to deteriorate to point where I either just quit playing or restart the Game.\n\nThis has been the trend for as long as I can remember with this Game, sometimes they seem to do something that increases FPS sometimes they do something that decreases it and overall updates end up feeling like a bit of a mess (they basically have to re-relase the same thing a few times to get it 'right') lower end Computers may have difficulty even connecting to servers as a lot of people complain about the loading icon just hanging and being kicked back to the browser.\n\nLoot:\n\nI find the loot placement in this Game to be a bit bad tbh for a number of reasons:\n\nThe Models are very bright and just look out of place with the Grungy run-down evironment they're in\n\nItems are placed seemingly randomly about the place with no real thought or imagination put into their placement\n\nSound:\n\nI find this really lacking, not only are a lot of the sounds just bad to Begin with (particularly Weapon sounds) they're also really glitchy. Sometimes sounds that should be quiet (like footsteps) can play across the entire Map while you won't hear a pick-up truck that's about to run you over from behind due to sound Glitches.\n\nGame-play:\n\nThis Game can be really fun due to the novelty of stuff like Foliage etc but that are a lot of issues taht get in the way of enjoying it:\n\nShooting mechanics aren't that great TBH neaither are the models or the overall 'Feel' of Weapons (They feel flat and unsatisfying to use) combine this with rubberbanding and what seems like at times very spotty Net-Code and you can wind up with some very annoying and seemingly unfair Gun-Fights.\n\nBack-Story/enemy and Character design:\n\nI find this a bity lacking TBH, the Story reads like a Poor mans Fallout. IMO, given the aesthetic of the environment and how the it feels they should've gone down more of a Stalker-ish route with the Story and Monster Designs.\n\nPlayer Characters are good enough and do the job but I find the enemy NPC designs just boring, bland and un-imaginative. They have a lot of scope to do something more original than just Enemies that may aswell just be Zombies chasing you around the environment (which is what the current placeholder AI basically are).\n\n\nOverall:\n\nIf you ar a fan of FPS' or Survival Games in general and have a decent enough computer to run this Game i'd say get it as it can be fun even in it's current state, i've had more fun playing this than I have with Games like H1Z1 or Day-Z which I just could not get into. If you're on the fence and don't have hardware that's all that decent or only meets the minimum requirements i'd say avoid it.\n\nNeeds more content, more optimization and some aspects completely overhauled but does have potential to be a Fun and unique Game.","February 15","true","421.7"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Players are friendly and would often help you uot if you need help. The loot is just about perfect but the good guns can be a little bit hard to find but if you find a gun you would olso find ammo for it. The map is small but they are probably gonna make it bigger. The cars you find all need the same parts soo you can use the same tires on a atv aswell as a car. The combat system isnt really that great tho.

Has working cars as well as advanced base building. Further, the devs constantly update the game as well as expand the map. The map is very diverse and each part is unique.

The base building is not over complecated like some other survival games are, simple materials and doesn't take long to build a simple base for you and your pals. The game is stunning to look at and when the rendering gets more advanced it will truly be the best looking game out there.\n\nCons:\nI found that the gun fights are not as engaging as the gunfights in DayZ but thats because guns and ammo are probably easier to find, I should imagine when I get a lot of good gear things will get a little more tense.\nThey do however need to add storage box's for bases as the only way of storing things is in a car and they are hard to come by and even then it's not certain it will be there when you log back in.\n\nOverall this game is awesome as has got me hooked and coming back for more, I just hope it becomes more of a community and clans grow to build some absolute mega structures rather than the KOS that always comes with games like these.","November 5, 2015","true","29.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesus1983/recommended/299740/","jesus1983","Jesus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jesus1983/","76 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I stated playing this game as soon as it was released in October of 2014. The game at the time was awful, it was laggy, the creatures were just awful, small map, and well just not a lot of things going on. I played off and on last year not really putting a lot of time into the game mostly after a patch I would check it out.\n\nSo after the latest patch I jumped in and being a few months of not playing I can say this game as taken a turn for the best. The creatures are still annoying if anything and glitchy still but improved sense the launch of EA. I do know they will improve as they develop the game so I am not holding it agenst the devs I know it is a work in progress.\n\nI used to have a hard time finding everything I needed to get a truck or tractor working. Yes you need to find everything oil, gas, 4 tires, drive belt, battery, and spark plugs. Finding all of that is a lot of work but I was finally able to get everything together in this one town and drove off in a orange truck. Man was it fun, and going from town to town and finding little gas stations along the way was a joy.\n\nThe map is ever growing, I finally found a in game map. When I opened it it shows part of the world is red so i assume that is parts of the map that will be unlocked as we go through EA and that is a great thing to see. The world looks great, and the towns really make you feel alone in the world. The level of detail that has been put into making everything look post-apocalyptic is great.\n\nThe crafting is moving right along, it takes time to build a base and a good one at that. You need to really scavange to find things. It really makes it a challenge and really makes it feel like you are "surviving".\n\nI would recommend this game just for the fact its not dayz, its so much better then dayz. This is a great game to play with friends and you can create a clan with your friends. The level of detail put into the world is awsome and the devs should get a high five. psst hey dayz devs.....this is what the world should look like.\n\nSo buy into the game you wont regreat it, I did when it first launched but I am so happy now that I did and you will be to.","March 26","true","31.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Right now this is the only EA survival game i have installed and its the only one i need.\n\nOnly reason to wait on buying this game now would be that there is no storage system, so building a base is nice and all but there not much point cause you cant build storage chests.

BUT with there new AI and net code systems coming online storage containers are one of there top priorities!\n\nMy ratings.\nGraphics: 9/10 (its amazing but not perfect)\n\nSound: 6/10 (This could use a lot of work IMO, i dont like the gun sounds AT ALL and some sounds will just not play when other SFX are going off. bugs i assume)\n\nGameplay 7.5/10 (only 7.5 cause it is fun dont get me wrong but things a survival game should have are still missing but thats what there new AI and net code will fix.

If you have any doubts about this game, i would say pick it up when its on sale and just try it out, very fun and you will see that the game is always moving forwards.

However, the world seems well designed and built, and you aren't instantly overrun with Zekes as they are fewer are further between than in most of this genre of game.\n\nThere is a very true sense that there was a mass culling during the war prior to the games setting.

Chatted with a few people here and there. After about an hour I started wondering into the country side and shores. Long ways from town I climbed a ladder and was flung off (this has happened 4 times so far) respawned said "aight lets try this again and not do stupid stuff" went on my merry way and looked for the holy airfield which is basically Mecca for all players, we all make our holy homage there atleast once in awhile right? Well I went on my way and was chased by 3 different groups of mutants. After what felt like years I finally made it to the holy airfield. I then proceeded to make the mistake of jumping off the cliff and had to restart. I finally made it back and by now have met a decent amount of people, all who seem friendly by the chats I've had with them. But I make it in and I met someone, teamed up, and have been kicken ♥♥♥♥ and forgetting names since. 10/10 love this game, I don't know why it has gotten bad reviews and not much recognition. Some problems tho (which I can easily ignore because this game bae) is the ladder glitch and sometimes items spawned IN the ground","November 1, 2015","true","82.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

The game for the lack of a better word (imo) is amazing. The level of detail put forth and the commitment by the devs is just top noch. The addition of player built bases with an actual type of control over where they can be done is perfect. This game has everything that a survival game would want and more coming. Not everyone is KOS so makes meeting new people possible, its how I met the clan AFD and run with them. Base building is very well done with plenty to make it your own area and fortify it up. I started playing when outta the max servers you were lucky to get 20 people across em all. Boy has that changed, now you can rent your own or play on official. I'd say a good 75-80% of the servers are over 1/2 full and growing. I fully support this game and try my hardest to get others to join up. Either through streaming it or just bugging the hell outta my buddies till they fork the money out.","November 7, 2015","true","86.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","7"

BUT if you searching game 100% pvp, fast action, you have old computer, crafting, building make you sick and also  you dont like survival dont buy this game. For me this game is almost perfect. Why i write almost? BZ it will be perfect when devs realase the full version.

He states that the Devs aren't reviewing the game and liking their own reviews, yet in the same comment mentions that he did a review for the game, it was a joke review, and didn't actually state his opinion on said game. While this is true, it is a review that recommends the game, so, joke or not, he did provide a score AND did review the game, as a Dev. Below are my thoughts on the game.\n\nThis game is terrible. I have wasted my time and money with this purchase and I advise anyone who reads this review to NOT PURCHASE! The game has a decent community for this type of game, this is true. However, in the time that I have played the game, I only ran into one player and one monster. That is a little over an hour of gameplay, running around and doing nothing.\n\nIt is like Day Z, but there is very little crafting, there are hardly ANY monsters in the game. And no, I don't feel a sense of panic or a sense of urgency while playing. In fact, I have tried playing the game twice and have gotten bored through it both times. I have run into buildings and vehicles in which still have no textures on them. They are only polygons of those items. This game has been in development and available for purchase since October. The fact that there are still missing textures is quite ridiculous. Also, add the fact that monsters are nearly nowhere to be found, as are players, and you end up with a game that has very little play value.\n\nTo be completely honest, after I had stumbled upon my sixth pair of sunglasses, fourth shirt and second pair of pants (with nothing else to be found) I realized that all the houses on that block looked identical, had nothing in them, and looked worse than other games of this genre (H1Z1, ARK, etc). Honestly, I can't recommend this game in its current state. I can't ask anyone to play this game.\n\nPlease, save your money and your time and look at other, better, survival games.","June 30, 2015","false","1.5"," 123 of 237 people (52%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","52","123","237","12","9"

The textures, the lighting, the trees, everything is awesome!\n\nThe gameplay is smooth and straight forward!! Shoot, hit, dead, no lagspikes and there's bullet drop which makes the game a bit more challenging, but it's something you learn by playing.\n\nI love the idea of crafting guides scattered around the world so everybody just know the BASIC stuff, instead of everybody building mansions and all that, it gives the game a bit more survival feel to it.\n\nPros:\n+ Wonderful environment.\n+ Large areas.\n+ Smooth multiplayer.\n+ Looting, mining materials and crafting works great!\n+ Heart racing when meeting other players (do they, or do they not want to kill you).\n\nCons:\n- Still som issues that needs resolving.\n- Graphical bugs, you wont notice.\n- Quite a long loading time, but for a game this detailed, it's okay.\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is the best buy i've done in a long time, and could pretty much be a gamechanger in the survival genre.\nCan highly recommend to everybody.","August 6, 2015","true","59.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","1"

SO WORTH BUYING!!!!\n\nPros: GOOD STUFF (PREPARE FOR A LONG READ)\n\n+ Base building (sorry no storage just yet will be a while small team it takes time)\n+ NEW Weather update is AMAZING! SO IMMERSIVE SO BEAUTIFUL SO MUCH FUN CHASING TORNADOS. People are grouping together to chase them.\n+ The New SVOGI render makes lighting so amazing you have never seen anything this good.\n+ Runs on Cry Engine, at 1360x768 I get 38-50fps at medium/very high with a 6 year old gtx480!\n+ Freeform base building! Place it where you want but no floating items :)\n+ Plenty of mutants. They are dangerous & Mutants have aggro animation thing it looks smooth as hell\n+ Amazing animations ladder climbing is perfect in third person and first person\n+ Has Emotes! F2 - F10 i think but yeah you can wave stick fingers up thumb up, thumb down etc\n+ Vegetationi is beutiful and there is bending with moving in bushes and sounds :D\n+ Extremely Immersive!, You get drawn into this game and forget what life is\n+ Has Crafting, from learning recipes to make more stuff for your base or weapons such as molotov, baseball bat with nails in\n+ Learning recipes for stuff like work lights around the base :D\n+ Simple crafting menu no instructions needed\n+ Simple UI it does the job very well\n+ Big area to run around in and map will be getting bigger!\n+ Towns feel like towns plenty of buildings and things\n+ Feels like a real place not some fantasy makes no sense kinda thing.\n+ Has vehicles, Pick up truck, Airport luggage carrier thing, Bicycle and Quad Bike/ATV, Boat\n+ Can Sit in the back of pickup its awesome\n+ Can repair vehicles or heal people using a lug wrench/ Tyre Iron\n+ Vehicles require parts to get them going but you can drive without tyres just it doesn't work as good and flips out a lot :D\n+ Hidden Caves to explore! There is a nice atmosphere to them!\n+ Blowing up jerry cans / Petrol cans is fun you can catch on fire and become a human torch\n+ Fire on character is awesome, lost a torch? Simple burn yourself it looks great! :D\n+ TORNADO!!! ITS AMAZING! The sound is amazing too!\n+ Nice Sounds! Not only pleasing visuals pleasing on the ears too.\n+ Foot prints! You can draw ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the sand :D\n+ Actually has a race track!\n+ Updates are always better and if one doesn't work to well there is usually a hotfix that comes not too long after!\n+ At the moment the community is great! Try voiping or text talking you'll find nice people\n+ BamBam Tshirts ingame are awesome :3\n+ Has squirrells deer and i think a snake or something too\n+ Kythera AI system the same guys doing the ai in star citizen\n+ Day Night Cycle, Night looks amazing too the screenshots don't do it justice\n+ Glowsticks/Chemlights are fun and light up the area :D Different colors too\n+ It has pink smoke grenades! Colored smoke is awesome\n+ The wind from the storm is amazing with the trees moving about and struggling to see\n+ Physics on the cloth thing at race track is amazing. Just run into it you'll see it wraps round you and things.\n+ Clever design, the same buildings do not feel exactly the same. Everything feels unique\n+ Crafted 5.56 with red dot is amaze (I gave it to rick grimes before i had to go)\n--------------------------------------------\nCons: BAD STUFF @.@  (Not many nothing really game breaking)\n- Some invent bugs\n- Not enough vehicles around they get horded so quickly and locked away in tough bases\n- Small team = takes time for things to come\n- No storage as of yet will be implemented down the line when they get stuff going (give them time guys stop complaining about it just enjoy it for what it is because it wont be in this state forever)\n- Few clothing clipping issues.\n- Needs more wind at times during the day or night like the thing at the race track goes crazy in the wind but the grass is really calm and trees only move during storm\n- Swimming bug sometimes you swim above the water\n- Mutants do need work on their pathfinding and the way they come at you and just being aggrod in general\n---------FINAL THOUGHTS (well so far will come back to edit in future :D )----------\nFor a small team, this is one game with a hell a lot of quality to it. Everything is beutiful in this game, the water, the grass, the trees, the foliage in general, bushes moving when something is in them the sounds, the rain effects, the building designs, the clever non repeating pattern of the same buildings. Honestly this game is just so underrated. If your looking to play dayz try this instead fps are better and its a lot more enjoyable.

Miscreated only has more good to come, the game is based mostly off community suggestions which means if you make a good enough suggestion that most of the community favors it may be added. The developers are very interactive and are always open to suggestions, this is always good in a game. Overall, I think the game is very good and has a ton of potential If you want to support a game I would say support this one.\n\n*EDIT* 11/10/2015\n\nRecently I have been playing miscreated again to see how far the game has come, I am completely blown away by the progress they have made. The map has gotten much bigger, there is a ton of new loot, and not to mention the vehicles and basebuilding. The graphics have always looked great but with there new lighting it is breath taking, everything from interiors of buildings to plain open feilds looks beautiful. The newely added bunkers and caves add a whole nother dynamic to the game, the dark atmoshperes of the caves and bunkers add a perfect area for some creepy player interaction ;) aswell as some awesome exploration elements to the game. All and all this game is constantly expanding and adding to its already amazing features, If you have the slightest intrest in the game I would suggest picking it up and if you really dont like it then just refund your purchase.

Having played it for only about 4 hours, I think I would have definitely purchased it myself.\nIt is a survival game -  much like DayZ and H1Z1 but with the elements of Rust or Ark.   There is a crafting aspect as well as a building aspect.\nIt's a grindy game -  it takes a long time to get ahead.\n\nLoot -  particularly weapons -  are difficult to find. I may not have been in the right area to look for weapons as it was my first time playing and I still only explored half of the map -  perhaps weapon spawns were not where I was.\nThe mutants are almost impossible to kill without a solid weapon (ie: a gun).\nThere is no good, official map for this game which makes it difficult to learn (but, I suppose that's  kind of cheating anyway, hey?)\nAll in all - I like the game. Yes, I would have purchased it myself, Yes, I recommend it...but you gotta be aware that its going to be glitchy.\n\nI had a lot of fun playing the game - and I have really only just explored the tip of the iceberg with it, I am sure...so my review will be quite vague at this point.\n\nPROS:\n-Survival game with many aspects- crafting, building, surviving\n-Not overly populated with players\n-PVP and PVE servers available\n\nCONS:\n-Mutants are WAY too OP\n-Servers drop a lot I have noticed\n-Sparse weapon loot\n\nMy Suggested Improvements:\n-More character skins options (only white male available now)\n-Decrease strength of mutants or Increase weapon spawns locations to enable better defense tactics against mutants\n-A better, official map needs to be made\n\nOnce I have had a chance to better play the game I will write another review.\n\nIn short -  fun game, is recommended\n\n","January 11","true","19.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","1"

Although it is overly difficult to even find a single person.. like WTF.\nAlso the glitch that makes you randomly spawn in the ocean that forces you to swim for 10 min onlyh to realise the game will not let you back onto land. Also I have not seen one zombie.. (not overly upset but still since I cannot find other people I may aswell fight them).\nAlso the rediculously dark nights I mean the game shows a full moon non stop, there has to be some sort of moonlight. I cant just run around with a torch on non stop, what happens when I finally find another person and they are not as polite as me?\n\n\nWhat was I saying, Oh yeah umm the game is actually pretty good considering it is still being sorted out.

This game is better than all of them in my oppinion. When you see the mixed user reviews don't be turned off by this game most of those bad review where from early stages of the game when it was much more buggy and did not have as much content.\n\nPros:\nGraphics: They look absolutley stunning.\nOptimization: You can run this game on high settings with a decent computer without any problems.\nVehicles: For a game that hasent even been out for a year this is an amazing accomplishment.\nBasebuilding: it is coming very soon! The dev team released a video about a week ago from the time im posting this review about basebuilding. This basebuilding in my oppinion will be better than any other survival game out right now, let alone that they are already releasing basebuilding is amazing.\n\nCONS:\nFighting and A.I. : At the moment the fighting system is wacky it is very hard to fight anything including the mutants that can apparently see me through walls but they will fix this all very soon.\nBugs: They will fix them.\n\n","June 18, 2015","true","7.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Its great! To me its not yet upto the standard of Dayz SA (Because I've been playing that for years-Dayz mod, Arma 3,etc.) but its 100X better than H1Z1. The game looks great, runs great and has so much potential for the future. Yes alot of the negative reviews will have been because of game breaking bugs and what not, and thats what I was expecting going into this game but so far nothing has risen? This game executes this genre perfectly and I am looking forward to seeing how the game becomes bigger and bigger!","April 25","true","7.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/coflash/recommended/299740/","coflash","Phill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/coflash/","863 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nStarted off alone at night, in the rain. Scavenged some houses and found a shotgun plus a .22 rifle, but couldn't take both, so I took the shotgun. I found a group of people who were friendly (though it was tense wondering if they were going to shoot me in the back). They had no guns, but they gave me ammo. We walked around for a while chatting a bit and I started to feel comfortable, then we decided to go to the airfield. They kept giving me helpful items while explaining how the game works. And then the server crashed...\n\nSo we all decide to log out and in again, except this time, as soon as I log in, there's someone else who decided to shoot on sight. As he walked around a corner, one of the guys I was hanging out with stepped in front of me as he logged in, so I basically ended up shooting the guy who I'd been chatting to for the past hour, the guy who gave me ammo and other helpful items, right in the face.

No other game has managed to hold my attention and guide me through an untold story like this one has, either through a sleeping bag hidden away in the attic or an underground bunker filled with glow, It is reminiscent of "The Forest" in the way it fills you with more questions and just enough answers.\n\nThese factors only go on to support a fantastic looking world and smooth gunplay as the game does well to make you feel in control of your character one hundred and ten percent with smooth performance and slick movement. This amicable environment is carried on in the community where the players around you are friendly and helpful, and the devs are always communicating.\n\nThis goes on to be let down by few factors.\n\nThe existance of an "Invisible wall" surrounding the map makes it feel small and isolated, Something which a free roam survival game wants to avoid at all costs, and zombie AI which is buggy and hard to compete with unless you have rounds to throw at them. These factors are being dealt with as I'm writing this, as the developer has claimed A large city is being built for the north of the map and the zombie AI is apparently being redone.\n\nOverall, a pleasant suprise especially for it's rather low price and definitely one to look out for in the future.","February 18","true","3.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

It's not a bad game, looks really neat and works well, but the loot is lacking, there are very few items in the game at this current stage and it already feels somewhat dull after playing it for 5 hours.It feels like i've already seen everything this game has to offer. BASES ARE USELESS, there is NO STORAGE CONTAINER TO BE BUILT, placing foundations is difficult. You can't open crates, doors, windows etc. The map is relatively small.

It is really hard to find a decent weapons... would be nice if we can make weapons from mother nature.\n2. Since this game does not tell you where you are, it is really hard to find my friends. Hard core survival theme is\nokay regarding with finding your location yourself, it would be great if I can spawn next to my friend. I spent 30 minutes just to find my friend and died from a hungry bandit who had a truck and guns. ( I will never forget that red truck)\n3. Wish there be a tutorial for beginners.

Even I still don't know how to make a car!!! Please provide us with tutorials that will tell us all the mechanics available in the game.\n4. BoB system would be great.

The world is designed and put together perfectly (can seem rather small but updates keep it growing) The base building is good but is way too hard because of the limited slots in inventory and weight. I understand either having slots OR weight but both is just stupid. gameplay mechanics are fine but could be better , animations are all good and gunplay is good but heavy(that's not a bad thing though)\nThere are hardly any zombies/mutants around but they sure do f you up pretty bad so stay away from them.\nThe lightning and atmospheric feeling is AMAZING , they push the game at least 4 points up because of how good they are! I know it's the cryengn and all but damn this is a pretty game.\nSo there you go , a honest review.. Could be great but lack of content is holding me back.
