Instead of controlling any of the characters themselves, you instead get access to a wide range of powerups that you can use to influence the outcome of the game. Initially, you begin with just mines that you can place to blow up the enemy players (or even your own, if you're so inclined) but as you progress in the game, you get access to other powerups (some of which include cows that run people over, rockets, UFOs that pick players up, rabid fans that help your team kick the ball, etc).\n\nEach match in the single player mode has an objective, which may range from "win the match within the time limit" to "get the score to exactly 5:4". Therefore, there are times where you'll have to use your weapons on your own team mates to manipulate the score.\n\nThe gameplay is relatively fun, whacky, hilarious and addictive, although the game suffers immensely from imbalance. Some items, such as the Red card (that sends a player off the field) are incredibly overpowered and ruin all the challenge in the game. I would actually recommend trying to avoid some overpowered items if possible, as they completely eliminate any difficulty in the game, which further removes any real incentive to use different tactics to complete the objectives.\n\nThe graphics and sound are pretty mediocre, although none of this is particularly bothersome for a game of this nature.\nApparently this game has multiplayer too, although I haven't tried it out yet. I imagine it'd be relatively fun, particularly if you were able to restrict the use of some items (i.e. the aforementioned red card).\n\nOverall, I would recommend you try out the game, as it did hold my attention enough to actually beat it.","July 6, 2014","true","9.9"," 58 of 69 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","58","69","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/263740/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","FootLoL enticed me with its soccer theme and its madness on the field. Upon playing the game a little bit more, it's definitely not for me. I'm not a casual gamer by any means but do like playing games like this in-between other games. Reason I cannot recommend it is that it gets boring after a while. I may find it boring, you may not. Heck, I'm sure kids would like this game.\n\nAn emphasis on strategy should be put here rather than soccer. Although soccer seems to be the main theme of the game, you (as the player) have about zero control over the players on the pitch. The only thing you can control is placing tactical objects or weapons on the pitch. Some of the weapons that are included are land mines (which blow-up opponents when they are near), meteorites where meteors will literally come from the sky and hit the field, a herd of cows can be used to flatten your opponent, ball multipliers to increase the amount of goals you score when the ball goes into the net and not limited to turrets. Counter-measures are also included to help you defend your players from your opponent. Armor can be equipped, bubble spheres can be erected to protect players (or the ball from moving forward), speed boosts or speed traps, protective bubble shields that can block ball and players as well as the ability to expand the opponents net. There are A LOT of weapon options in game which is a great feature.\n\nThe players themselves do not make much of an effort to dodge any of the obstacles. Essentially, they have positions but players will move near the ball if it's close by. The game feels pretty balanced. Deciding which weapons to take to the "battle"field can literally make a night and day difference in the score. Choose the wrong power-ups or use them too much and watch your score stay stagnant. There are a few game modes in FootLoL : championship mode where you tour the world/solar system, quick match and multiplayer mode. Most players will most likely choose to pursue championship mode before anything else. In championship mode you start with a certain amount of slots and certain amount of abilities. As the game progresses (and the better you do in-games), the cash-rewards become a lot bigger. The AI within the game also becomes progressively difficult although most of the time beating him isn't the most difficult. Meeting certain objectives laid out before hand is where the challenge lies. Each match is timed and the team with the most goals when the clock hits zero, wins. The better the performance and the more conditions that are met means a better payout. Don't forget though, your opponent can possess the same abilities as you!\n\nVisually, the game play is cool because there is a lot going. Watching meteors fall from the sky while sheep are running across the field while blobs are blocking certain players can get insane. As I said, visually watching it is cool. Playing it is a completely different story (because this is where the limitations start coming in).\n\nThe biggest issue for me is that this feels like a game I would play on the iPad. I understand the "mobile gaming" platform is slowly evolving and yes programmers should get some credit where credit is due, but I certainly do not like purchasing games that could be played on an iPad (on a rig that costs a lot more than one). As I've said, if you're into strategy and something a little bit different with some outlandish effects, I'm sure you'll enjoy the game. If you're here for some soccer or some sort of inclusiveness, it's not here. If they added a gimmick or something in which you could control players, I'm sure that would have added another depth to the game.\n\nOverall, I won't recommend it as it's not my cup of tea. However, if you do like this (even for a full price), I would recommend getting it. I think there was enough put into the game to get enough bang for your buck.\n\n\nRATING : 6.0/10\n\n\nGameplay	C	Story / Campaign	C+	Visuals / User Interface	B-	Sounds / Music	C	Replay-ability	C+	Overall 	C\n\nScreenShots :\n\nChampionship mode view\n\nAbilities upgrade menu\n\nThe meteor effects are pretty good and deliver a solid umph\n\nMeteor after-effect\n\nThere is a lot you can do in this game that could be considered cheating\n\nWeapon options","April 19","false","0.9"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","21","27","0","4"

This game's genre (what I think) is Real Time Strategy (although you cannot control the players), because this game needs you to make decisions whenever you think the team might need some support, and because this game is not turn-based (as you can see in the video in steam store). If you play Battlefield 4, it's like having a pocket sized commander mode, very small map, giving support to your fellowmen. I did enjoy doing that,, until I've done around 40% of the Earth Stage. Since I'm a perfectionist, I tend to get all the challenges done (challenges are written at the top left of the screen, with scores you have to have in order to complete the challenge). This REALLY gets harder and harder for me, as a strategy game newbie. I did also see myself doing some facepalm because I was being serious with just a game *facepalm*. For now, I would recommend you buy this, instead of buying snacks that will be a pleasure for few minutes, and buy this game, which will be playable for such a long time. It's definately not a game you would want for Dota2-like competition, but rather for fun like throwing grenades at each other in PAYDAY2. So, yeah, don't buy if you're pro at Dota2...\nOther informations- From what I've played, 1 stage is around 1;00~2;00, with endless replayability. It does not have any RPG features, except maybe the skills or upgrades you can buy with the income.\nAnd last but not the least, the game is VERY light compared to the price, with 96MB of installation and around the half for download...

You do not control the players themselves, but have to guide them to scoring goals by using power-ups in the right way\n- lots of power-ups with different characteristics: meteors, cows, flak cannons, air strikes, shields, teleporters, ball clones, crazy fans and a lot more\n- RPG-ish upgrades to improve your team and cosmetics (new flags, eyes, hats etc.)\n- Pretty nice sound effects, especially when you spam the pitch with different power-ups simultaneously\n\n\nThe negative aspects:\n\n- strange goals. Sometimes it happens that you put the ball wide, but then it drops into the net, counting as a goal.\n- gameplay gets repititive after a short time\n- 2D/3D graphics mashup. You're getting used to that, but putting the 2D players into 3D would have been nice\n- The biggest counterpoint surely is the strange tasks you have to complete. In most of the games you have to complete three tasks, which are always special scores. For example, for the first task the game wants you to lead by 3-0, for the second task to be down by 3-7, and for the third/final task to win by a 5-goal margin.\nOn the one hand, this gameplay element adds some tactical depth into the game as you sometimes have to support the opponent's team and sabotage your own squad. Otherwise - pardon me - strange thing to support somebody you have to beat, isn't it? Like corrupting the game. And I don't think that FIFA developed this game\n- multiplayer is as good as dead, unfortunately\n\n\nResult (and summary for those who have no time reading):\n\nOk, basically FootLOL is a fun football game with entertaining gameplay and a huge variety of power-ups to reach your goals. Though there are some counterpoints, like strange goals and tasks to complete, you can have a nice time spamming the field with cows and meteors.

It's best played in short sessions of about 30 minutes. You don't actually control any of the players but you can help them out by keeping them safe, or by hurting your enemies. You do this by using power-ups.\n\nYour team will shoot when they're near the goal and they'll do the best they to keep the enemy from scoring. Finishing ('winning' is the better word here) matches will earn you money and completing objectives will earn you even more money. This money is used to use more power-ups, or to let you choose more of them, or to improve the AI of your team, for example.\n\nThe graphics are simple and the sound effects are very basic but it has a certain charm, I guess.\nThere are several worlds to complete so it will take at least a couple of hours to complete it.

Skills range from simple things such as the infamous red card to strategic bombardment and UFO's.\nObviously some combinations are more unbalanced than others, ban all enemies from the field, summon some fans and drop a few extra balls to get as many goals as you want.\n\n...which actually isn't helpful, since the game gives you a few objectives for extra in-game cash, and they're all "reach a score of X:Y", and you have to wait for the enemy to score the points you need really slowly, kind of like watching a bull ♥♥♥♥ your wife for those in the know (I'm sure there are many in the gaming community).\n\nThe length is abysmal, after the tournament/campain mode, which lasts 4 hours (a bit more if you want to reach the random score every time), you don't have many choices.\nYou could try getting the few achievements that are left, and that will take 20 minutes at best, but then what?\nThe multiplayer is deserted, custom mode offers no challenge, and you've gone through the campaign already.\n\nA bit like fastfood, amusing for a while, but little value outside of that, FootLOL sets no miraculous goals in front of itself, but that kitsch nature unsettles more than attempts at grandeur.\n\nStill a thumbs up because turning your players into spartans and summoning gatling cannons is something I always wanted to do in a football game.","September 21, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It’s currently retailing on Steam for five bucks, which isn’t a bad deal all things considered.

This works really well as a game mechanic, because the cheating process is versatile and open to mistakes.   You can speed boost your defender by the ball, the player he passes to and then explode the goalie, or you can accidentaly speed boost the opponents offense and blow up your defender.  Everything happens super fast, which gives it a really zany vibe.\n\nThe game offers incentives to play in favor of the opponents early in the match, which is a fresh approach to the issue of difficulty.  Sure you can win with a little skill, but setting yourself up for a big comeback and then pulling it off takes finese.  It really says something when a game encourages you to antagonize yourself in a positive way.","July 13, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This was fun.\nThe 'campaign' in FootLOL is a series of very short (< 3mins) matches where you basically try to win the match by blowing up the other players (with mines, fireballs, and charging cows) and also by giving your players some temporary advantages (such as speed boost, shields, and sparta combat gear).  Then there's the whole suite of abilities that alter the field of play, like sticky goo, holodomes that block balls, flaming soccer balls that goalies won't defend against, fans that charge the field in uniform to both play and take out the opponents, and many others.\n\nIt is absolutely awesome to send dozens fans to storm the field and then let loose a bunch of extra soccer balls in front of the opponents goal.  Scoring comes fast and furious even without blowing up the goalie.\n\nWhile this great little game doesn't take too long to complete (2 hours to complete the many matches for Earth, and then another 2 hours total for the Moon, Mars, and Saturn) it sure is a lot of fun.   8 out of 10.","January 23","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Player with most goals win the match.\n\nSome exapmles of basic power ups:\n- haste to one footballer for about 10 seconds\n- stop time for about 5 seconds\n- create some shield that blocks the ball\n- meteor that can knock players down for a moment and destroy shields\n- mine than knocks down players for about three seconds and can push the ball in a direction opposite to the side of explosion (physics, you know?)\n\nThe player also have possibility to buy some advancements like more income or slight advance in speed of footballers (that look like 2d cartoony like characters, funny enough).\n\nThere is one basic exploit. About an hour into the game and I have found one stage that you can reload to have goals like win with goal pattern 1:0, 3:0 and so on. Such a game takes about 10-30 seconds to win and gives 750$. Upgrading income by 4% costs 500%. Please do the math yourself and calculate how much time would it take to upgrade your income to a maximum level (25 times 4%) thus giving you a permanent upgrade of 100% more income.\n\nRince and repeat such a stage that you can complete under 10 seconds and earn so much money in about 2 hours of gameplay that you will (yes, will) win the game without any difficulty at all.\n\nThus such an exploit is quite a fun killer to me. The game is still nice to play and use really wacky powerups (cow stampede, meteors, bombarding, spawning additional balls so you can have scores like 38:19, so on and so forth) but why shouldn't a player not use such an exploit to win the game easily? There is no motivation to play more levels, and some of them can drag itself for about 2 minutes. This can be long, believe me.\n\n----------\nFor anyone interested in joining in on completing your own backlog; check it out here - http://steamcommunity.com/groups/completingthebacklog/discussions/5/530645446320364338/","January 12","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pretty casual but in a good "Plants vs. Zombies" way. 7/10\n\nPros:\n1. Lots of unique powers, keeping each match feeling different and fresh\n2. Replayability is pretty high\n3. Can be played in short bursts or for long periods of time\n\nCons:\n1. Art style works but could use some more detail. Feels bland\n2. The randomness of the "soccer players" was a little frustrating\n3. Casual (I'm never the biggest fan of "casual")\n\nCasual gameplay has a tendency to deter me. However, there is enough variation here to recommend this game to anyone who enjoys games.
