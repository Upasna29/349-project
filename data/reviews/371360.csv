The enemies are too strong, the weapons are too weak. There is no animation to indicate that enemies are being hurt or even hit by your defences, which makes the whole thing feel fake.\n\nThe waves start off MUCH stronger than any defences you can buy which leads to defeat very early on. There's no ramp up in difficulty, just a game that seems like balance wasn't even considered in its development.\n\nIt's too bad as the graphics are rather nice and the idea is sound. Unfortunately, the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.\n\nIf this were early access I would say go for it and request positive changes to the game, in the forums. Unfortunately, this is sold as a finished title, and it's frankly just not finished enough to be enjoyable.","May 10","false","0.1"," 70 of 78 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","70","78","0","2"

Because it´s random what sort of creeps and which node they are coming from.\nI think the starting waves are also to big or maybe the towers are to weak.\n\nYou don´t get any feedback at all.\nHow many HP have the units? How big is the wave and from which node are they coming next?\nWhen you want to upgrade your skills, the upgrade points are covered behind a tree and you have to guess or go back to the main overview to see it.\n\nA lot of this things may be patchable, but at this state its not worth the money.\n\nPro\nNice medievil cartoon graphic\nBasic but solid TD mechanics.\n\nContra\nNo Tutorial\nThe Game gives the player no feedback on the creeps and waves.\nOverall unbalaced","May 10","false","0.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","33","39","0","0"

First of all there is no tutorial, which in VR would be nice seeing as the controlls are not exactly apparent. I understand I am supposed to be able to go into FPS mode but there is no clear indication of how this happens besides alluding to it in upgrade paths. The graphics are solid and the gameplay looks like traditional tower defense but without clear instruction of how to play the game this is mostly useless.","May 10","false","0.2"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

I was really looking forward to this game, unfortunately it is nowhere close to release ready.   I really liked the graphics on this game and hope the developers are able to make it work.\n\nHere are the main problems I experienced in my brief playtime and how I'd like to see it fixed.\n\n1) Towers should be introduced slowly over the first few story levels.  Currently once you start level 1 all towers are available with no way of knowing what each is good for.\n\n2) Enemies, again level 1 and there were numerous different enemy types.  Introduce them slowly over a few levels so we can learn how to combat the different types.  Maybe a pop-up the first time an enemy appears telling us about them.\n\n3) Theme, This is a fantasy orc tower defense, I don't want my Gatling gun spitting pitiful little balls of light that slowly follow the enemy.  I want cannons, bullets, maybe a wizard.    And add some sounds and impact to the enemies.  The guns currently do so little damage you can't even tell if they are hitting the mobs.\n\n4) Difficulty.  The game is way too difficult.  Enemies are too fast, too much health, guns don't hit hard enough.  Multiple separate paths on the first level.  Tone this stuff down.  Give us a few levels of 1 path to get used to the game.  make the enemies killable.\n\nSome form of fixes are needed for the above points for the game to even be playable.  Below are some thoughts on how I think the game could go from playable to awesome.\n\na) First Person Towers.  Perks point to us being able to enter the towers for some first person action.  This sounds awesome, it sounds even better if we could control the guns while in the tower.  Imagine holding your 2 vivemotes up like you have a Gatling gun in front of you, the haptic feedback shaking your hands as you empty thousands of rounds in the approaching orc horde.  Maybe shoot for the legs to slow the enemy or go for headshots to do extra damage.  Some enemies could have armor, making it more efficient to shoot them in the extremities.  Unfortunately, I don’t know if it is even possible to enter the towers yet, I could not figure out how.\n\nb) Movement, while I can access all the towers from 1 spot with the laser target, let me teleport around the board so I can lean in and get a closer view of the different areas of the map\n","May 11","false","0.3"," 22 of 26 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","22","26","0","2"

The menu appears in such a way that it is partly covered by vegetation and other menus causing visual mess. The music is pleasent, but you could be dying or winning: it never changes. There are particles but too many (the 'dust' in the air, for example, is distracting) . And sometimes too few: for example, the location where you are about to add a tower is barely visible. Your hands have got two wands, but the commands are not clear, and the information you need has to be found in the wrong places.\nI played only the first level and shortly, because, in my opinion, the game is far from release-ready, even as early access. They seem to have problems with writing the gameplay code, with the GUI, and with the user experience (controlelrs, commands).  The positives are that the game does not cause nausea at all, and the the environemt, props and characters look very pretty.","May 10","false","0.2"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

I think that tower defense is an interesting game to try to make in VR so I gae it a shot. Seems a lot more solid then I was lead to beliveve. There have been a few changes so far, and the deve seems pretty resonsive to make changes and fix things. Wish there was more in story mode, but otherwise I've played this game more than most of the other ones.","May 23","true","3.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love some tower defense, and to be able to play it at a model playset scale in my house is awesome.\n\nYou basically use the two wands in your hands to call out build instructions and establish the regular mechanics of tower defense strategy. There simply not that many games like this in VR, so this helps me get my fix.\n\nI think the other reviews are a bit harsh, but the deve had released some fixes, and i had no issues with playing the game, so i guess those issues were already fixed by the time i tried it.","May 24","true","2.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But I did it after the patch so I have to say: it's way to easy. Took me three games in both modes to get to 'i could do that all night long long' mode. And in 'survival', I did. I left the game running while watching a film and in lvl 235 it finaly crashed. No winning condition, no stronger waves (orks never reached third line) - nothing. The storymode lacks any story - or level progression or anything. But at least, controls are pretty broken.\nSadly beacuse of my 'where will this lead' experiment, i could not refund the game, though there is no fps mode (or did anybody find it yet?), only 15 waves (not 20) in story, still a lot of issues with the UI and in the end it even stuttered for one hour before it didn't let my doything at all.\nI hope, things will get better with some time... but they have to improve a lot.","May 15","false","8.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The graphics aer indeed great and really make you feel like you're controlling a minature army of defenses, just what I was hoping for. Quite challenging, but I don't rally mind that, there are a lot of different combinations to try to win the game.\n\nAt first I did have some problems getting a randle on the rules of the game, becuae there is not really an explaination of how to place your towers, but I figured out that you can point at the ground and then you get a selection screen for towers. Seemed pretty strightforward as soon as I figured that out.\n\nI like the overall look and style of this game, I wish that there was some more things to grab with the controllers, but it's still totally playable now how they have it. It shows the future of tower defense, now they just need kingdom rush in VR!","May 27","true","7.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no difficulty curve that lets you get used to the gameplay, it just throws a ton of orcs at you where most of the time your sci-fi towers won't be able to kill even one of them.\n\nThe sci-fi towers make no sense in the fantasy setting (unless you change the title to Lasers vs Orcs).\n\nYou have access to all towers from the start of the game so it's hard to learn which ones are good for which enemies.\n\nThe sound is poor quality and repetitive.\n\nOverall this is not worth any price at this point as it is more of a simple prototype rather than a full game release. The graphics are nice and the idea of placing towers is fun but it's just not ready for release. Maybe one day it will be improved and I'll be happy to take another look.","May 18","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
