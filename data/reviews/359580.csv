"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/359580/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Right off the bat, Uncanny Valley gets points for doing something very few horror games do. It's a game that purports to give you control over the story, letting you actions affect the outcome. If you played Home, it's the same thing that game tried to do and failed completely at. Uncanny Valley actually makes it work, and the result is an intense and engaging game that you REALLY have to meet halfway.\n\nYou're Tom, an unremarkable everyman with some remarkably terrible dreams. You take a job as the night watchman at some abandoned facility up in the mountains, trading off with some fat jerkoff named Buck on watching the empty offices and halls. Right away, the game makes good on its promise. After Buck gives you the 60-second tour, you're free to wander wherever and do whatever you want. There's the facility proper with 4 floors, a warehouse, and a secure sector to explore, there's the apartment complex and its 4 floors of rooms, and there are some smaller areas like the woods and generator building. Within these mysterious environs you will find keycards, cassette tapes, and PCs still logged into their company emails for some weird reason. There's not a huge amount of stuff to interact with, but there's a lot of ground to cover and some clever connections between all the pieces.\n\nThe catch is that you still have a job to do. You're supposed to show up to your shift on time, stay in the facility until it ends, and get back to bed before you pass out. That doesn't leave a whole lot of time to comb the whole place, so you really need to pay attention to the clues and follow up on them intelligently instead of turning the whole building upside-down. You certainly have the option of going rogue and doing whatever you want, but there are consequences for that. It's worth trying, too, because there's a surprising number of fates Tom can meet, depending on what you do.\n\nThat really turns out to be the heart of the game, how much you're willing to experiment and work to get the whole story. I bungled my first playthrough so badly that I got unceremoniously thrust right into the dark secret of the place, which I again failed to escape and got possibly the worst end I have ever seen for a protagonist. On my second attempt I managed to work out some pretty vague puzzles and escaped the whole security job portion of the game entirely, moving into a proper survival horror crawl with weapons and healing items and video tapes and more. There was an entirely different back half to the game I hadn't even seen the first time! And that's cool, very cool, but it's going to leave you cold on the game if you don't work to find that. I mean, imagine if you never found the second castle in Symphony of the Night.\n\nThe journey to uncover the game's secrets is a pretty harrowing one, as well. The creature designs and animations are on point, as are the sound cues and music. I think I got my biggest scare in recent memory from this game thanks to a particularly excellent encounter design. That care and detail unfortunately doesn't extend to the game's inventory system, which can be cumbersome to deal with, but also somewhat underused. There are numerous bugs with the interface as well, with menus and interactables not getting proper focus and having your character scoot around as you try to manipulate something else.\n\nPolish gripes aside, the only thing you need to ask yourself before picking up Uncanny Valley is, how hard are you willing to work to enjoy it? If you only spend an hour on it running around the empty offices, you're bound to be disappointed. It's only when you dig in, make the connections, and commit the time and attention that its brilliance starts to show through. That means it's definitely not for everyone, but for my part it's worth the effort.","October 24, 2015","true","2.4"," 54 of 59 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","54","59","0","1"

Drawing inspiration from Human's old Clock Tower games, Silent Hill, Twin Peaks, and perhaps the game mechanic from CoC: Dark Corners of The Earth as well, it's an interesting if flawed experience.\n\nIn Uncanny Valley, You're playing as Tom who accepts a job as night watchman at the abandoned facility way out in the middle of nowhere. Besides that building and the apartment complex that used to house its staff, there's nothing else for miles. The only people you can talk to is either Buck, the day guard or Eve, the maid at your apartment building. Neither of them has a whole lot to say, so you're left to your own devices, patrolling the corridors of the main building overnight, with the working shifts lasting around seven minutes, to make sure nobody is messing with it and then going home to go to sleep after your shift. Day in, day out.  Except there's all these computers lying around. And tapes. And videos. I mean, it's not like you have much else to do during your shift, so you may as well play around with them, right?\n\nWell as much as I like to explore the facility and try to solve the mystery behind it, the selling point for this game is undoubtedly its branching story, which ultimately leads to one of several possible endings, like a Choose Your Own Adventure tale, and this is where the problem lies.\n\nIt seems to me that the developers were far more interested in making consequences to your failures rather than add in deaths that would require multiple playthroughs of the same area. For example, when enemies show up, this just means that you get beaten down and the available suite of endings changes. Enemies will also just give you game-changing injuries, such as chest wounds which cut down run time, a broken arm that makes weapon use impossible, or a broken leg that removes your ability to run.All of these things might make the game needlessly confusing and unfair, except that the game is very short. An hour or two is often all you need to play through it. So when you know what you're doing, the first half of the game where you work your night watch job becomes really redundant, but you still have to play through it each time to get to the game's more challenging second half. This can waste up to a half hour of your time on stuff you've already done, and it gets old real quick. This might not be a big issue on its own, but when enemies show up in the second half, things get worse. A simple screw-up can put you on the road to the exact same ending you got last time, and now you'll have to replay the whole game again for another attempt. You can try reloading an old save to make another attempt, but the autosave system often makes that impossible, and even goes so far as to delete your save when you get an ending. So, something that was meant to remove the annoying repetition of death in games actually has consequences that make you repeat the ENTIRE GAME instead, which is a whole lot worse than just repeating a small section. With the large consequences for failure and the lack of manual saves for me to make another attempt when I wanted to, it just wastes too much of my time on needless multiple playthroughs at the moment.\n\nOverall, I love this game and would really like to explore it more, but I can't justify playing through another hour of it only to get the same ending again, even when following a guide. There’s a chance you will play the game a second, third, or maybe fourth time in order to experience the different endings, but if you, like me, felt satisfied after the first playthrough, the desire to replay it just plummets. Uncanny Valley is an interesting game with many great ideas, but without some saves to pull from, I just can't bring myself to keep trying for the other endings and recommend the game to other people, even for ten bucks.","March 25","false","4.0"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","26","29","0","0"

However Uncanny Valley brings in some really fresh ideas and ways of dealing with monsters, story decisions, and death.\nThe story is front and center here first and foremost. Albeit the way that it is told is through observation. You read what became of the former employees of the company you now work for. You listen to audio recordings and eventually even see video logs. This all changes in the second act of the game. You become front and center and every decision you make can lead to an ending. Speaking of endings. Uncanny Valley has quite a few of them. You are free to do what you want and go where you want just about. The developer does a nice job of making sure that scenarios the player can come up with are handled. Never is this more present then in the second act. Where if you make a mistake and get caught. Its all over. Start over and do better. This is a great and bad thing. While the game does instill fear in you and makes you think and be careful. One who doesn't know what their doing is doomed to repeat the first act of the game over and over until they read a walkthrough or figure out the puzzles. The game only features one game save file and that's it.\nThe game features a unique combat/heath system. Where you tend to wounds and reload your gun. While the game is a Survival horror it almost plays like a point and click adventure game. Criss-crossing between these genres seamlessly and without letting you know.\nUncanny Valley has some really good ideas and executes them effectively for the most part. There is a few blemishes in the replayability and weird wonky bugs. However these are all minute and don't detract from gameplay. In all I can't wait to see what Cowardly Creations cooks up next.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/cathIteVgnw\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","26","31","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/recommended/359580/","spiritreviews","Spirit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spiritreviews/","732 products in account","Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!\n\n\nIt's the end of my first week at this place. I - heh - I was excited for the quiet, for the isolation. I've learned this past week that I would kill, ♥♥♥♥ING KILL for the din of a busy restaurant, for a socially inept slacktivist with a petition to invade my personal space, even for a shouting match with my brother.\n\n\nIt's funny when you think about it.\n\n\nWhat I would give to see another... lost my train of thought. It's hard to stay coherent when you're bleeding to death.\n\n\nIs a nightmare still a nightmare if you can't wake up?\n\n\nYou know what's the worst thing about this?\n\n\nThey will NEVER find me. Three Laws my ♥♥♥.\n\n\nUncanny Valley isn't that place where children eat vegetables smothered in ranch dressing and it isn't exclusive to sex sequences in David Cage games. The uncanny valley is a theory that suggests robots and CGI too lifelike (but still "off" or unrealistic in that uniquely robot/CGI way) is SUPER, SUPER CREEPS.\n\nI subscribe to this theory, personally.\n\nUncanny Valley is a story as old as time: Tom, our hero, managed to score a security job at a facility tucked away in the mountains where The Shining was filmed. Over the course of the two hour game you'll explore the facility, shoot the ♥♥♥♥ with your coworker Buck, and unearth horrible secrets you should probably not have unearthed. It's classic survival horror down to a T, and Uncanny Valley nails the mechanics and atmosphere admirably.\n\nUncanny Valley revolves around the night guard job. Tom's shift lasts seven fleeting minutes, which at first seems a little punishing. Muster enough motivation, however, and you can cover a lot of ground during your rounds, checking emails and exploring offices, labs, and warehouses. During Tom's rounds he'll pick up video recordings, audio recordings, and plot progression tools. With each passing night scripted events will occur which, depending on the player's actions, will alter the events resulting in a variety of endings and fail states. I haven't seen a game with such subtle variety since Silent Hill 2 (the thematic opposite of later series entry Silent Hill 5: Back 2 tha Hood).\n\nBut is it scary?\n\nIf you watch my video you may determine that no, it is not. Which is what I thought initially! And I'm pretty easy to frighten. But you'd be wrong to think such naive thoughts. While it isn't overtly terrifying, it is... creepy. Unsettling. Sinister. It plays a lot like a Japanese horror game where you can't quite shake the feeling that you're being watched by something bigger and badder than you that's just biding its time, watching you squirm while it finishes its taxes. And I'll be honest with you: I'm a pretty jaded guy. But there were some moments in this game where I was revolted, and that's not a sensation I can say many games have made me experience.\n\nBut it isn't all starshine and puppy farts, unfortunately. Besides some weirdly written dialogue, wonky voice acting, and typos here and there there are some bugs. Manipulable objects can sometimes be pushed out of frame, and Tom will occasionally load into an area and plop down as if he were hovering. Worse still I encountered a bug where Tom's shift would end before it began which led to some Kafkaesque shenanigans where I couldn't make him sleep and he just passed out where he stood after some time (at one point I couldn't even get Buck to leave the office). I'm not sure how frequent this is, and if some of the "bugs" I encountered were just the game being spOoOoky. If you have any trepidation just wait to see what bugs are encountered at launch and hopefully the devs will patch any serious offenders.\n\nAll that aside I think Uncanny Valley is an atmospheric, enthralling horror game. Classic survival horror enthusiasts will have fun pursuing the different endings, solving puzzles, and getting out of sticky situations.\n\n...\n\nAnyway, your shift starts soon... oh, you don't look so good. Close your eyes for a bit, I'll keep watch.\n\nPromise.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrfRFqE2EV8&index=4&list=LLwz4a4TyKTfxyz819pv3q3w","April 23, 2015","true","4.2"," 48 of 69 people (70%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","70","48","69","8","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/359580/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3342 products in account","The cancellation of Silent Hills, and the subsequent removal of P.T. from PSN remains the single biggest blow to Triple-A horror fans in quite some time, if not ever. While Konami continues to burn every bridge that linked them to console games, disappointed horror fans can at least take solace that new and exciting horror games continue to manifest in various places courtesy of Indie devs. There is also the possibility that Hideo Kojima and Guillermo Del Toro will take their abandoned ideas for Silent Hills and kickstart their own horror project free from Konami’s incompetence, but until then we must stop dreaming about the future and partake in the nightmares of the present day horror scene.\nUncanny Valley, the debut title from Cowardly Creations, is a game that very much borrows elements from Silent Hill, Twin Peaks, and other surreal stories of insanity. Players assume the role of Tom, who starts things off fleeing for his life from shadowy pursuers, then waking up from the apparent nightmare to begin his new job as a security guard at a mysterious facility. His only companions at his new job and residence are the overweight and overly cynical Buck and the soft-spoken yet friendly Eve, respectively. Other characters of various classes and corporeal existence come and go throughout the day, but the primary goal is to work each shift and shuffle on home to bed.\nThe first unique feature of Uncanny Valley is the most noticeable: the visuals. While 2D pixel art is becoming more and more common, particularly with Indie games, it’s still a welcome sight to see the age-old medium used to tell a mature story, such as last year’s Gods Will Be Watching or the 2012 cult hit Lone Survivor. What Uncanny Valley lacks in facial detail, it makes up for with expertly crafted animations that convey what Tom is feeling at all times, whether it be pain, fatigue or fear.\nThe second unique feature is what the game is missing, and that is the ability to fail in the traditional sense; there are no Game Overs or respawns, even when players fail to evade an inhuman pursuer. The days progress regardless of what action the player takes; whether Tom is completing his job as a security guard or lounging about in his apartment, once his internal clock ticks he’ll cease consciousness and drop to sleep regardless of where he is. Naturally, this results in multiple outcomes as well as multiple endings, which in turn results in multiple playthroughs where players can experiment as much as they want to see where their actions take them throughout the story. Or they could just look up an online guide and follow that instead.\nRegardless of how players approach it, Uncanny Valley is an interesting idea that is mostly marred by its technical oversights. Small examples include being forced to turn on the flashlight every time players switch screens, a pitifully short stamina meter for sprinting that takes ages to recharge, and dialogue text that tends to be obscured or cut short due to scripted events. There are also numerous puzzles and situations where the solution is not always clear, and since time progresses regardless of whether or not you succeed, it can prove annoying having to start the game from the beginning because of one botched event.\nIn the end, Uncanny Valley brings an interesting premise and gameplay features that are plagued by arbitrary mechanics and technical limitations. With a bit more polish, Cowardly Creations’ next game may be the one to put the Indie studio on the map. Until then, give their first experiment a try once curiosity (or a Steam sale) puts you in the mood.","September 7, 2015","true","13.5"," 31 of 41 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","31","41","0","0"

It's short, but the replay value keeps you coming back, wondering what you could have done, or maybe what you couldn't have done. The game is an absolute macabre masterpiece and i think the developers should take some HUGE pride in their work. It has this marvelous simplicity about it and for 10 bucks i honestly couldn't have asked for more.\n\nThe Premise:\nYou are tom, a guy with a shrouded backstory, night terrors, and a new job as a security guard. The building is abandoned due to "finnancial crisis" and you are sent as relief for your (♥♥♥ hat of a partner) compadre Buck. I won't spoil it, but buck has a pretty big part in the story. You are taken on a short tour, then shown to the appartment complex where you meet Eve, a rather pretty maid that works at the complex. After going up to your room and suiting up, the game officially starts. (most of) your choices up until this point aren't really that important, but after you don your security guard uniform, the game takes shape.\n\nThe Gameplay:\nYou are given seven minutes (real life minutes) to pretty much do whatever you want. You could just be lazy, and sit in your security office, or you could go on rounds. Alternatively, you can also be a snoop and read people's emails, personal files, love stories, etc. The game is basically at YOUR disposal. The story revolves entirely around you and your choices that you deem the "best". The game controls are basic, but at times they can be the slightest bit funky. Pressing E and D to move a crate across the room for example, felt awkward on my hands, and the combat mechanics are rather lacking. there are also some choices that i would have appreciated a little more. like using a fire axe as a weapon against an enemy instead of hiding behind a desk. But i digress, this is less of a game and more of a "pick your own adventure" novel with a side dish of game. There aren't any dialogue options or anything like that, but it DOES give you a vast amount of freedom. The biggest drawback, is that some of the puzzles aren't exactly explained from a technical standpoint, and some logical solutions are thrown out of the window, which really hurts the experience in my opinion.\n\nThe Cast & Story:\nAlthough it would seem that for such a short cast, the story couldn't possibly be that interesting. However; the game suprisingly delivers a facinating tale of morality, obsession, and asks the question of "what makes us exactly human?". Additionally, there are actually several MORE characters that you get to know via emails, video tapes, cassette recordings, and other media. There is one downfall to the game's story though, it takes up until roughly day 2 for the game to change pace. When this change happens, it is dramatic, and satisfying, but LONG overdue. Furthermore, on multiple playthroughs there is no way to skip to this day using certain choices, or a chapter select option in the menu. This addition to the game would make it far more enjoyable and less tedious to replay and get all seven of the different endings, but i still plan on going back for more, and taking different routes to see where they lead. Another "drawback" of the game is that, though it features itself as a horror game, it doesn't really feel that scary until day two. This is a design choice i understand, as it creates build up and generates curiousity, but again, when it does start getting scary it is long overdue, and doesn't deliver that well with an exemption for a few scenes.\n\nThe Scare Factor:\nI know i said that the game isn't very scary. It isn't. it's no amnesia or penumbra, and you cannot go into the game expecting this. Instead, it offers more of a sense of dread. You feel almost watched as you're going through emails and looking for keycards. You can never shake the feeling that there is something sinister going on and you are simply a pawn in a much bigger plan. Tom's night terrors add to this, as they depict gruesome, strange, and lovecraftian scenes. The scare factor doesn't lie in what you can see. it's in what you can't see, and what you aren't able to understand. The art style and design are like HR Giger, HP lovecraft, and Ray Bradbury all decided to make a graphic novel in a pixelated 2D world. The game isn't a spookfest, but after a play session you still have the eerie feeling of being watched.\n\nThe A/V Aspects:\nThe game is done really well in the sense that they took the non-realistic characters look realistic approach. What i mean by this, is most characters lack basic facial features, have a generic shape, and look rather lacking. However, if you have that wonderful thing called imagination, then you have nothing to fear! This isn't to say that the character designs are bad. They're actually really well done, but they ARE 2D pixelated sprites, and should be taken as such. That being said, the color palette is very dreary and metallic, using many soft and low key hues, instead of big popping colours. This adds to the atmosphere and macabre situation you're in. Additionally, the game is DARK. and i don't mean you can kind of see silhouettes if you look closely, i mean you cannot see a damn thing without your flashlight through 60% of the areas, and 87% of them are dark enough to have your light on anyways. Even then, your flashlight only illuminates a small cone in front of you, and does a poor job of illuminating that cone. Graphics wise, it's basic. Which for this game, and the price thy're asking for, is reasonable. The sound quality however.. well it's not the greatest. On the plus side, the interaction sounds and interface are decent, but can be slightly buggy and repeat / remain constant through a playthrough etc. Most of the audio event ques and characters speaking aren't as pleasing. (outside of the tapes and recordings which i'll get to in a bit) They mostly just sound like gurgling 16 bit noises that sort of sound like words. Again, i get why they did it this way, to add to the atmosphere, but i find it to be rather painful to hear and lacking. It's a personal thing i will admit, but this entire review is an opinion. ANYWAYS there are also recordings and tapes you can find throughout the game, and for the most part, they sound pretty good. The doctor is well played and so is the AI he is speaking to. They are obviously not AAA but definately not awkward or forced.\n\nThe verdict?\nI personally LOVE THIS GAME. honestly, it's mone of the better indie games / 2D horror titles i've played in a while. It rivals Lone Survivor in that aspect and clearly had thought and care throughout development. It has it's faults, and the story can be a little slow to start, but those are only slight drawbacks to an overall good experience. However; I have to be entirely honest and say that this is less of a game, and more of an interactive version of one of RL Stine's "Give Yourself Goosebumps" books. This isn't a bad thing, but it definately can draw away from the experience for people looking for a video game. It has puzzles, it has "combat" and it has some elements that make it a game, but overall they aren't fashioned in a way, for me at least, to call it a video game. That still shouldn't deter you. If you have ten bucks just lying around, then give it a shot.\n\nTLDR version:\nStory: 9/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nGameplay: 4/10\nSound: 7/10\nReplayability: 9/10\nlength vs price: 6/10\n\nAs a Game:\nOverall: 7.8/10\n"go for it if you got the spare money."\n\nWhen viewing it as a Interactive CYOA:\nOverall: 9.4/10\n"definately worth it"","April 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","19","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonnyShadow/recommended/359580/","JonnyShadow","Doppelganchor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JonnyShadow/","419 products in account","Uncanny Valley is a fantastic pixelated Psychological Horror game. Hearkening back to the likes of the original "Silent Hill" titles, this game has amazing exploration and atmosphere which leaves you interested, anxious, paranoid, and fearful. There's a gut wrenching anticipation that grows inside you as you learn more about the larger situations at hand, leaving you waiting for the next surprise that may or may not be waiting for you behind the next door.\n\nI highly recommend playing through the story multiple times, as only one play through barely covers the surface of the deep, choice driven game play. You don't know you're making choices, but I promise with every interaction and step, you are. As of right now, 4:30 A.M., I've played three times and gotten a COMPLETELY different ending for each play through. The first of which I had earned left me in awe with my hand over my mouth as I watched the final cut scene play out in grotesque detail.\n\nUncanny Valley is story driven in the best way possible. Even after three different play throughs, I'm itching to play once more just to see what will change. Each time I play, I learn even more about the mysteries and hidden secrets buried deep within the abandoned establishment and it only makes me want to read more of the e-mails and watch more VHS recordings during the next in-game night shift.\n\nUncanny Valley isn't an experience you'll soon forget. As someone who grew up watching horror films and playing horror titles like "Silent Hill," I highly recommend this experience to anyone who's interested in sitting down and immersing themselves in the environment and within the identity of newly hired security guard, "Tom."","May 10, 2015","true","5.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

He is in charge of the night shift, and when he starts exploring the facility he finds secrets that should not be unveiled.\nSaying something more about the plot would ruin the entire experience. There are multiple ways to proceed in the story, and multiple endings to be unlocked. The atmosphere is fantastic, similar to the one in the first Silent Hill games, and exploring the silent corridors listening only to your footsteps is really creepy.\n\nGRAPHICSThe game has a pixelated look which is more detailed than the one is Lone Survivor, but with less detail than the one in Westerado: Double Barreled. It still looks really good, and the areas are big and varied enough to never tire you.\n\nGAMEPLAYYou explore the environments, looking for objects to interact with and collect. You will encounter puzzles that aren't that hard to complete most of the times, as well as some sessions in which you have to run away and hide from the enemies which are suprisingly fresh and intense in their execution. In case you get hit, you must find bandages to heal yourself in a similar way to "Call of Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth".\nUnfortunately, there are some problems. First of all, it is really hard to know what to do and where to go sometimes (even though that's kind of the point). You also have a stamina meter that depletes way too fast, and when you run your flashlight turns off, forcing you to stop and light the environment before running again. The game is still very enjoyable, and this are just a few nitpicks that can be easily fixed.\n\nCHALLENGEThe game's puzzles are relatively easy to beat, but unlocking some endings and surviving the entire game is fairly challenging, especially when avoiding the enemies.\n\nSOUNDThe sound effects when exploring the environments help creating the sense of dread that we love in the good ol'horror games. The soundtrack by Danilo Kapel is also great, and I recommend buying it.\n\nREPLAYABILITYThere are a total of six endings to discover, tapes scattered around the facility to listen to, and 18 Steam achievements. The game's story is interesting enough to make you go back to it multiple times.\n\nFans of classic survival horror focused more on puzzles than combat will love this experience, while others might be turned off by the non-linear storyline.\n\nStory: 8\nGraphics: 8\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 7\nSound: 9\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 8.5\nFRUSTRATION: 6\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","April 24, 2015","true","4.8"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

I beat the game my first play through, by just leaving the main area. Car keys are nice! One my second play through, I watched myself get knocked out by a robot... You dont want to know what happened to my limbs after that. Now I plan to do many more play throughs because of how much stuff there is to do in he game. So overall this game is like a 9 out of 10.

The game really puts and edge on a lot of things and also keeps you wondering about different outcomes. However, there are some more bugs I found. Some where little and did not matter, while only a few could be annoying. Overall the game is still a 9 out of 10 in my opinion, but some things could be improved. Not the storyline though.

The night terrors in this game are fantastic, and can actually make you fear going to sleep, in the game and real life. I abandoned my bed for the latter part of the first half, since not making it to bed lets you bypass night terror sequences. Eventually even your daytime existence becomes terrifying as well. There is a certain point which progresses the story. What happens during the cut-scene depends on all the tiny actions you take during the game.\n\nThe game starts out with the main character Tom being shown the ins and outs of his new security job. Each night you will hunt for clues. There are tapes that you can playback and gain a bit more knowledge about the storyline, as well as computer terminals that will drop clues about where to find keys needed to access restricted areas of the building you are guarding. Should you really descend to the lower sector? You ARE the security guard, and there MIGHT be somebody down there. Or according to certain emails, something. Do you dare to unveil the mystery?\n\nWhichever path you unknowingly decide to go down will eventually lead you to the second half of the game, this half is less about time-management and clue-finding and more about the visceral terror the game has been building towards thus far. There are some cool mechanics in this more combat-focused half, such as damage crippling your movement. However, there are some counter intuitive aspects such needing to engage the enemy in order to activate a trap. Combat is to be avoided, which means to even try this move, you need to be extremely desperate or really lucky.\n\nOverall I found the two halves meld together quite nicely. Just when you are into the routine and having a hard time finding something new, the game throws you a curve-ball. The art and sound design are much more than I would’ve expected from the game at a glance, though the voice-acting leaves something to be desired. The story will require multiple playthroughs to piece together, since it seems to Tarantino around. You also can’t skip the first, more monotonous half, making multiple playthroughs repetitive. Uncanny Valley is a solid game for those that enjoy a good story, but it could certainly do with a bit more polish.\n\nGameplay:\n\nControls- 8/10\nFun Factor- 4/10\nDifficulty- 5/10\nReplayability- 8/10\nInnovation- 10/10\n\nAesthetic:\n\nGraphics- 6/10\nMusic- 10/10\nSound FX- 8/10\nStory/Lore- 7/10\nLevel Design- 4/10\n\nFinal Score: 70/100 for innovation, music, and atmosphere.\n\nSummary: Immersive but subtle horror game that builds a strange atmosphere into frenzied panic quite beautifully.\nVerdict: Action gamers won’t be satiated, but story-based gamers will have a ball for at least the first few playthroughs.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-uncanny-valley/\n"Let's Review" video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAW9xSK-M0U","July 13, 2015","true","2.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Spoilers may follow.\n\nMechanics\nThe dialogue is slow and halting due to the way the text boxes work, and the boxes can go off of the screen where you can't read them.\n\nThe inventory and item system is clunky and hard to use, and there are no tooltips to explain what the items are without clicking on them, which forces you to exit the inventory.\n\nWhen you move furniture it snaps around all crazy, and can be moved through walls.\n\nThe flashlight turns off whenever you move between screens, which is absolutely pointless and annoying.  It also turns off when you run, but this is forgiveable despite the fact that it often means you are staring at a black screen when moving between areas.\n\nGameplay\nYou go in and out of dreams/hallucinations, and wake up suddenly somewhere else.  It is sudden and just does not work well as it feels contrived as a wayto make the gameplay move between set pieces.  It is not exciting or mysterious, it is just kind of pointless and annoying.\n\nYou are supposed to be doing shifts at work, except it is just always night time and the clocks never change, and there are no real mechanics related to working... you just wander around exploring until you fall asleep and are forced into a sudden set piece change.\n\nIt is not clear what you are supposed to be doing, ever... and then some people will run towards you if you are in a hallucination and then it is time to move to the next set piece.  The scripting is just awful and totally ruins the experience.  I smashed a mirror with a blue box, or something, and then put a shard in a hole in the wall.  When I did that I suddenly teleported back to aprevious room being dragged into a medical area, then the person says something threatening to me and I watch her go stand by a cabinet... after a couple minutes of her standing next to the cabinet doing nothing and me being unable to interact with her I decided to walk to the left.  Apparently this triggered what I imagine is supposed to be a chase scene, because she suddenly bolted towards me and did a wierd hip bump that apparently knocked me out.  Then suddenly I am tied to the wall of that same room and she is all ripped up for no reason and cuts my arms and legs off and I beat the game.\n\nI feel like this could be a very creepy and interesting game, it was fun to explore the world and read people's emails, and the inclusion of voice tapes was neat except that they are very hard to listen to due to the clunky inventory system.  It almost felt creepy, but the ambience was ruined by the bad mechanics and pointless sudden set changes.\n\nAll in all I am disappointed by this game as it seems like the developers had a good idea and came close to pulling it off but just couldn't quite do it.\n\nTry Lone Survivor for a well done version of what I think this game was trying to be.","April 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","38","65","0","0"

Better camera angles would have really worked here though, as i feel that i was unable to react fast enough to the things that came on screen.\n~Controls are generally pretty good and feel responsive, but i feel as if they don't make much sense sometimes. For example: both the 'E' key and 'Space' key do the same thing. 'E' is to interact, and 'Space' is to pickup. Not sure if many people feel the same but i think i would prefer it if they were the same key. Also worth mentioning that while it might have been a design choice, the shooting feels counterintuitive and unnatural.\n~While it's not a huge issue, the Pause screen GUI scaling with the size of the view port is mildly infuriating, especially considering the fix for this in GM is as simple as switching over to use the 'Draw GUI' event. but other than that the UI makes a lot of sense and is overall really impressive.\n\n-Seems to have suffered the fate of a lot of games like this, where the solution seems to make no sense, and is not what the player would have done, creates this notable gap between player action and character action and as a result a lack of immersion happens.\n-Dialogue feels a bit paper thin and inconsistent at times, Tom, the main character seems to have this weird dissonance between how he acts and responds from scene to scene. E.g. Sometimes he comes across as sarcastic and witty, while other times he is deadly serious.\n-Game breaking glitches and moments that really threw me out of the experience, like endless black screens, or enemies teleporting in front of you. Feel that maybe playtesting was needed.\n-Irritating that each time i wanted to read something at my own pace i couldn't because i feel that i had to rush to beat the game timer.\n-Lots of little things contributing to me feeling unable to immerse myself in the world. And so at times, it did not feel all that scary at all.\n\nOverall I feel that this game has a lot to offer you, and you won't come away regretting your purchase, but i feel this game really needed more time to mature to get these bugs out of the way, and to fix a lot of the kinks that really suck you out of the experience. There is a lot of potential for this to be a genuine winner for those that really enjoy a horror that will run through your mind when you lay in bed at night.","April 25, 2015","true","5.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The idea seemed good on paper, but the game was presented in a rather mediocre way. For example, time really has no consequence and your shifts do not matter, as when you pass out or fall asleep it just moves onto the next set piece/day, and a few nights into the game the whole system is just thrown out.\n\nThe game is linear, and even when you do decide to take a different path to try and test its consequence system, you barely arrive anywhere different, as the underground facility is so small it's over before it begins and you know where you are/continue moving down, which is all you do. Find a way to open the security door on a floor with a puzzle, then enter and press the button to open the elevator to the next floor, rinse and repeat a few times.\n\nI found at least 10 bugs in the first 20 mins of playing, something the QA team apparently couldn't see. Bugs including it crashing at the most simple ending to get, double inventory resulting in items carrying over with a new game, auto saves ruining the chance of collecting items you need to proceed in game and invisible characters to name a few. I'd say avoid this game like the plague but it is still enjoyable, mediocre, but enjoyable.

Is this game unnerving? Definitely. Walking through the halls when you know you should be safe shouldn't be as unsettling as it is in this game, which makes it perfect. The gameplay was smooth for the most part, and the story interesting. The deliverance and mechanics though felt lacking. The dialogue was often cut of in cut scenes when I didn't manage to cycle through it fast enough, and sometimes felt choppy and rushed. The sprinting mechanic was way out of balance. You're capable of sprinting for 4 seconds, and after that you're gassed out. It makes it very difficult to run away from the shadow men unless you know exactly where you're going. But overall, this game was still enjoyable, and I do recommend it, especially if you're a pixel horror fan.

It is a 2D Horror Survival in which you impersonate Tom, a newly hired Security Guard at some isolated facility of a mysterious society. The story itself is pretty damn interesting, but it begins to unveil only after you start making choices. Yeah, choices, the game is developed with them in mind, every action you take, every thing you do, every choice you make will have an effect on the story. And that's where everything start to seem beautiful again. Even if you end one storyline you may have missed a detail or something, and... you want to play again. That's the strategy this game uses to keep its longevity. Presonally I would've liked it more if there were random-generated scenarios/puzzles. However, Uncanny Valley is one of those indie games we miss to see from quite a while, definitely worth the money.\n\n\nFor curious ones: the name comes from a theory from a Japanese professor. To make it brief, if we give things an humanoid appearence we start to like them, but after a while if we add too many of them we fall in the "uncanny valley", then if we make them almost looking like humans, well we will like them again.","October 1, 2015","true","4.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Many of the scenes featured in the trailers are not even present within the title. Much of the footage that had been seen prior to release is not in the game at all. What we've been left with is a sad, hollow husk of what Uncanny Valley could have been, and all the potential that lies within.\n\nThe biggest drawback for this game is the fact that the "horror" is completely predictable. For a game that boasts multiple playthroughs as its primary source of entertainment, by the second playthrough I knew exactly where the "scares" were going to be; however minimal that they were.\n\nSure, the game has multiple endings... around six, but many of them are only small derivatives of each other requiring minimal choice differences. About 90% of the entire game is explorable within 10-15 minutes, with the latter 10% taking maybe 5 once you gain access to it.\n\nI wish that this were the Uncanny Valley that was to be, and not just this slapped together version of it. Maybe one day we will see the full product. On the upside, however, the Devs are very active in the forums, and 98% of the bugs have been ironed out.\n\nIf you want a game similar to Uncanny Valley, check out Home. It's cheaper, and offers more replay value with less tedium. I would not suggest paying full price for Uncanny Valley. I paid roughly $4.00 on sale, and would have felt ripped off if it were any more than that.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","October 14, 2015","false","7.6"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","14","23","0","0"

It's understandable if the developers don't want a save/load interface, to keep the feeling of choice/consequence wherein if you make a bad call, you could die and have to start all over, but in that case, there at least needs to be a way of quickly skipping parts you've been through before, namely the intro/first day.\n\nGoing to stick with it because from the looks of the trailers, there's still a LOT I haven't seen yet, which is my hope, though it's hard to tell what you can/can't interact it, so I'm not really sure what I'm missing. Seems like a game for which there's a hump to get over and if you do, there's a great experience to be had, but there will definitely be a lot of people who find it slow/tedious/obscure and lose interest before they discover the depth beyond the surface.","April 30, 2015","true","6.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

In Uncanny Valley we play as Tom. Tom arrives in an isolated location to work as a night guard at a building that was shut down due to lawsuits. Once you arrive you don't feel welcomed and there's tension in the air as people around act strange and you try to find out what kind of secrets Tom's new job holds. So how is Uncanny Valley ? This is probably my favorite horror game I have played in a while. This game forces you to think fast if you want to survive. This game also doesn't rely on jump scares as there's only one sudden thing that happens that could be considered a jump scare. The game makes you feel uneasy due to the fantastic atmosphere, sound effects and music and you feel like danger lurks around every corner. The game is a simple 2D horror adventure game. You find stuff and interact with other stuff so you can progress the story but this game is very simple and it doesn't put incredibly cryptic puzzles in front of you cause a lot of the puzzles are incredibly simple and you will find the solution within seconds but there are a few exceptions. The story is amazingly put together. As soon as the game begins you begin to feel uneasy and that's why Uncanny Valley is so scary. Hell it might be one of the scariest games I've played to date. There are also multiple endings you can get with different choices you can make throughout the game. There are a few bugs like text's merging into one blob of unreadable nonsense and a few instances where the game didn't let me pick up items. Overall if you are a fan of horror games you simply need to own Uncanny Valley cause this is one of the best horror games out there. Well worth the 9 euros. I give Uncanny Valley an 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","May 28, 2015","true","3.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

Also the game isn't really clear about what reactions your actions cause. And one puzzle I tried had the math for the answer calculated wrong, and the other I couldn't figure out after half an hour and the internet couldn't help. Gradually my excitement tapered off into a bizarre mix between slack jawed wonderment and a bland tedium, as the plot spiralled into insanity and the gameplay became unclear and repetitive. It's just a real shame that this game didn't have more money or a longer development cycle, as it's just broken in a lot of fundemental ways.","October 27, 2015","false","2.4"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Very atmospheric and tense at times, which is great. But I also have a few gripes.\n\nThe pixelated graphics are done well, and the environments look great. The music and sound is ambient and fitting, too. The are a few sound bugs that may necessitate a game restart to shake off.\n\nThe speech bubbles got really annoying. They should do speech bubble per paragraph, instead of individual sentence lines. It felt like I jamming the space bar incessantly everytime I spoke to someone.\n\nMy main complaints are with the story and gameplay structure. The story starts off really interesting, but it's painfully easy to figure the whole thing within the first five minutes of gameplay. I had hoped that the developer would surprise me somehow and intoduce amazing twists of some kind; but personally, I was disappointed. Also, the developer basically abandon all sense of mystery and tension by halfway through the game, when it just became sort of a typical horror game. The sense of mystery and dramatic tension I felt near the beginning of the game was what really drew me in, so I was disappointed when the game abruptly changed directions and abandoned most pretenses of mystery.\n\nFurthermore, its hard to even figure out exactly what the story is, althought it's easy to tell its direction. The game is meant to be done with multiple playthroughs due to differing consequences from your actions, so I understand that a player is supposed to piece together information from multiple playthroughs to learn the whole story. But I did make multiple playthroughs, each with widly differing actions and results, yet I'm still as confused about what's really going on in the story as I was before. Almost nothing is ever explained in plain english, even by the end. So even though I'm highly intrigued by Uncanny Valley's storyline, I am unfortunately not able to figure out exactly what the whole story is.\n\nAs for gameplay structure, it just feels like the game is somewhat cobbled together. Continuity between consequence branches can be poor; e.g. after taking an optional action, an NPC and the main character will talk about Element X as if they both know what it is, even though you've never heard of Element X, because you were technically supposed to have encountered Element X by that time in the game even though you actually haven't. This caused for some confusing situations which totally threw me off and wrecked any sort of "zone" that the game had been able to put me in up to that point.\n\nOverall, it's ok. If you're into this kind of thing, it's a good buy. Personally, I'd love to see this game updated and expanded a little. I think that a little TLC could make this into a really great game.\n\n","April 29, 2015","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

From beginning to end I got just about 2 hours out of this game (I believe I got the worst ending possible, which if avoided probably gives you a bit more play time). It was pretty fun, and has quite a few mechanics to it, many of which apparently play a role in which ending you get. Now bare in mind while playing this game, there is a lot of things to discover, read, and do which will impact your playthrough, which I feel probably was a big reason why I got the ending I did was I was oblivious to a lot.\n\nI picked this up on sale for $2.50 on sale during the Halloween sale, and would definitely say I got my moneys worth, I had good bit of fun playing this.\n\n\n\nI have only played through roughly the first 30 minutes and I can already tell this game is going to be great.\n\nThe atmosphere is great and always keeps you on edge, the intro was insane, instantly jumping into the action.

The story line is given in pieces that keep you wanting more. But sadly, Uncanny Valley is one of those games where the programmers had great ideas and just really ♥♥♥♥ed up the execution.\n\nBasically, you get 7 min a night to explore the facility you're in. Except it takes one minute or so to run to it, so really it's six. But then you have to run back to your apt the second you shift ends otherwise you run the risk of falling asleep where you stand.\n\nYou have to hit the "I" button to pull up inventory, thus making playing this survival horror game in the dark somewhere between frustrating and impossible. Using items is a ♥♥♥♥♥ because you have to open your inventory, select the item, then click on what you want to use it on. Forgive me for being nit-picky, but this is really obnoxious. I don't want to have to take the time to find the "I" key in a dark room, click on my item, and then fail to click on the right thing only to have to do it all over again.\n\nI went to the train-station at one point in the game and when down the steps toward the train. It's kinda where the game begins. I didn't want to board the train so I tried to go back. Couldn't. Love it when a game LOCKS me into a decision like that for no damn reason. Boarded the train.

The unease one is supposed to feel while their reality is being questioned is not there. While this gave me a sort of bad feeling in regards to the game, it swung right back at me with the real beginning, and the establishment of the real. When you walk out of the dilapidated subway train, into the even more decrepit subway station, and the reticent atmosphere grabs hold of you, that is where it all begins.\n\nThe interesting thing about a very pixelated aesthetic qua uncanny, is that it brings out the dread that comes with not bringing everything out in the open. The blank faces and vague outlines of every gestalt gives both the unfamiliar feel of the unheimliche (literally translated to un-homely) that is immanent in the appearance of the creatures themselves, but also gives room for an imaginative terror, the terror that our mind creates by filling out the blanks. This is further developed with the deliberate choice to have some scenes relatively silent, where footsteps and a zoomed out perspective creates a sort of looming threat from all directions. Since you sometimes walk behind objects (obscuring your character completely; also, if you can be behind it, something else can!), it creates in the process a sort of three-dimensional space in an otherwise visually two-dimensional space. There is a feeling of helplessness when you are in a three-dimensional environment but your mechanics are restricted two-dimensionally, this is perhaps not a novelty, but it creates an interesting play on the format itself, where dread can come from the very choice of format itself.\n\nMechanically, there are interesting aspects to it from the beginning that adumbrates the compromises you'll have to make, and subsequently the dreadful situations you'll have experience. While noticing that I could not run with my flashlight out, I immediately realized the dissatisfaction of running away from a threat, since it would mean plunging into complete darkness, but at the same time, the lack of speed makes the unknown's eventual bringing-into-light and attack on you so much more frightening.\n\nAmbivalence. There is this essence of morbidity and flesh in the sense of Francis Bacon. Bodies contort in fear or in torturous spasms, you see your character wake up from a nightmare and walk hazily, with an emotionally worn down stature, all perfectly portrayed with the otherwise indistinct artstyle. I love the macabre aspects of the game, the naked blank bodies – made distinct only by minor differentiating colors in pixels – that are hanging from the ceiling, and their truly uncanny animation. What the problem is, is when the game takes a duller turn with some of the creatures, like in the first scenes of the game where the black forms chase you down and envelope you. These have no interesting quality to them, which unfortunately makes their appearance feel like they rob you of your unease that otherwise makes the experience what it is. Uncanny Valley sometimes mistake the uncanny or unfamiliar with the unknown or indistinct, which unfortunately results in a visual ennui, it results in a consternating sigh in an otherwise visually stimulating/interesting world.\n\nMoreover, while some of the agents (enemies, hostiles, creatures, “things”, who knows...) in the game are perhaps not the most interesting, there are some absolutely amazing pixel art to be seen in Uncanny Valley. I prefer more than anything the coloration, and with it the great understanding whoever made the art must have of how crudely juxtaposed colors make a beautiful image, or how to create a more detailed or fine image from indistinct broader “strokes”. This is something you can see in the screenshots of the game in the store page and decide what you think for yourself, so me saying so is most likely pointless.\n\nWhile there are hints everywhere of what is going on, on my first completion of the game, I had no idea of what was going on, what was real and what was not. You continually wake up in different places, with different jobs, outfits and characters that lead you in different directions. Nothing is established as real, and you don't know what consequences are actually consequential. This is a game that requires multiple playthroughs to get any idea of what the game is all about, both to exhaust the story-elements and the different mechanics and art designs. This is not a streamlined game, for the most part. You are blind, and that blindness has consequences. I was just trying out things when awoken in a new place, and this lead to the end of the game. I had no idea why, or if there should have been a reason or character-motivation for what I did, but instead it felt like a mechanical ending. I did something with items I had, and I got to see a horrific end cutscene, that wasn't as uncanny as it should have been since I had only met that character once (I missed out on an objective, which may have been why the ending turned out like it did) and then the end credits rolled. The consequence system, that they advertise, is one that most likely can lead to a lot of flailing about haplessly, only to be jolted back into the story in a place where you no longer have a grasp of what is going on or why things are going on. This was my biggest issue, that the pacing suffered at the hands of the consequence system. Although this is possibly due to how I played the game, since a consequence system will personalize your experience with the game to a certain degree, I still have suspicion that I might not be entirely alone in this lostness in the game.\n\nI would probably recommend this. At this point in time, on a fairly lackluster first playthrough story-wise, I still enjoyed a lot of the elements of the game. The atmosphere and figures the game put forth were for the most part interestingly designed. Morbidity and contorted flesh was a prominent feature that I truly enjoyed. Uncanny Valley has some nice things in store, nice in a disturbing sense, whereby the core experience reaches higher levels of enjoyment than other pixel horror games, but sometimes, due to how certain consequences play out, the story falls flat. What is fortuitous herein, is that the game offers more than what is seen at first glance. But you have to work for it, it is on you to find the points of interest, and to make the story what it is. That must make me a lazy, lackluster and rather boring player. I think I'm okay with that.","April 23, 2015","true","2.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/359580/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","The uncanny valley is an uncomfortable place to inhabit.\n\nFirst hypothesized in 1970 by roboticist, Masahiro Mori, and then later coined by author Jasia Reichardt, the uncanny valley refers to the unsettling feeling of viewing and interacting with something that looks and behaves in a way close, but not entirely, like that of a human. Generally, this is used in reference to the way technology is quickly reaching a point where it is becoming harder and harder to distinguish between the natural and the digital, with the likes of humanoid robots and photorealistic animation creating an uneasy dissonance between what appears real and what we know to be artificial.\n\nApproaching Uncanny Valley the game, the term would at first glance seem curiously bestowed. The aesthetic hardly begins to grasp at the lifelike, blocky characters and simple textures in no way attempting to disguise their digital existence. Similarly, Uncanny Valley is blunt and transparent in its mechanical introduction, producing to the player all manner of tutorial slides before the game has so much as begun, outlining how very game-y a game this is. But this disparity isn’t the result of a clumsy and inexplicable application of a term, but rather the basis of an internal dichotomy from which Uncanny Valley begins to execute an unnervingly grounded horror story.\n\nOn its surface Uncanny Valley is little more than disturbing anomalies and robotic sociopathy, but fueling these gross but not entirely terrifying encounters are more ordinary and distressing fears. The impenetrable anonymity of corporate hierarchies; humanity’s simultaneous fascination and terror at technological revolution and the possibility of artificial life; the daily mundanity and perceived insignificance of the working class, upon which all manner of inhumane practices are allowed to continue unchecked because the lowest rung on the ladder is the most readily replaced.\n\nUncanny Valley is terrifying because it takes America’s most entrenched capitalistic fears and proves them real. Yes, corporations really are as insidious and profit driven as they appear and we can do nothing to stop them. Robots will eventually destroy us and yet we continue to construct our own extinction. And through this all, blue-collar workers will continue to have no power, but rather be beaten down and eliminated at the mere hint of incompliance. It takes a conspiracy theorist’s mindset perhaps to buy into any of these lines of thought ordinarily, but within Uncanny Valley’s haunting soundscape and grotesque visuals, these ideas seem to hang over you suspended only by your own disbelief which becomes harder to hold to and gauge as the lines between dreams, reality, and what is actually going on begin to blur.\n\nBut I need to stop myself, because while it is easy to take the themes Uncanny Valley plays with and run with them, a distinction needs to be made between the horror Uncanny Valley alludes to and the horror it actually succeeds at conveying. And to that effect Uncanny Valley fails rather dismally. It may have a brilliant foundation for which to craft a socio-economic, technologically tinged horror experience, but it leaves it all on the table, opting for shock value over a lasting, pervasive terror. There is a lot that could be construed as frightening here, but little that stays with you once the immediate disturbance wears off, often before a scene has even come to its conclusion.\n\nUncanny Valley struggles in pacing itself in any way conducive to the sort of horror it employs. The plodding tedium of your character’s nightly shifts could have been used to build tension and explore the ways in which the game seems to position the working class as the default victim of every crime, but there is so little holding these segments together that often I found myself wandering a deserted building entirely bored rather than distressed, until an obligatory jump scare brought me back to attention. This hands-off approach is understandable within the context of Uncanny Valley’s branching design, with the decisions you make quietly shaping how the narrative eventually unfolds, but the variables at play are so opaque that there is no way of actually knowing what actions effect what outcome until it has already happened.\n\nPart of me loves that uncertainty and unpredictability, because it fits so nicely within Uncanny Valley’s theme of insecurity and helplessness in the face of industry and technological innovation, but Uncanny Valley never finds a way to balance its mechanical desires with those of its narrative. Either the story plays out linearly (or with enough present information for you to knowingly guide it) and loses the element of unpredictability needed to really sell the plot, or it keeps narrative forks hidden to the player and in turn causes the plot to feel uneven and shallow by keeping so much of the story locked away on paths the player may or may not ever see.\n\nWhich is a problem inherent to any game which requires multiple replays to see fully, but it is especially bad here because the unpleasant and inscrutable nature of the game left me with little enthusiasm to venture through it again. Uncanny Valley is upfront in telling you it needs to be replayed multiple times, but it never gives a reason to want to. So much of the game consists of tiresomely meandering through empty rooms, uselessly attempting to interact with objects which may or may not change how the narrative actually unfolds. I felt as lost during my first playthrough as I did having beaten the game, as incapable of understanding the underlying forces at work within Uncanny Valley’s plot as when I was first introduced to them, and the idea of spending another few hours trying to break out of that mold is actively off-putting rather than compelling.\n\nUncanny Valley wants to be a game you discover slowly, that eats away at you a little more with each new piece of information discovered until the whole thing is finally laid bare in grotesque completeness. But for as much as it might pester me to see it through again the mystery hidden under its tortuous mechanics never became intriguing enough to force me to make sense of how to find it. Uncanny Valley scratches at the surface of some of the most internalized and adaptable fears of modern society, but doesn’t go deep enough to leave me more than mildly perturbed by its gloomy theatrics.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","March 19","false","2.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

There are some throw backs to that series in the game that a fan would appreciate but never felt like a rip-off.  Maybe more of an homage?  I'm sure others may disagree but that's the vibe I got playing this.\n\nI had a solid amount of time to play Uncanny Valley before it was released, being able to reach a few different endings, and I had a great time with it!  The pixel graphics are done very well and were used to create a haunting and dark place to explore.  From the music to the SFX everything was as it should be for a suspense/horror game audio-wise.  There aren't a lot of characters in this isolated place but they were fleshed out well enough for me to feel one way or another about them as you played through.\n\nOnce ♥♥♥♥ starts going south, as they do in horror games, things really get challenging and I found I had to get creative on the spot in order to avoid harm/death.  There is no permadeath unless it lend to the story via one of the many endings you can earn.  Dying otherwise would be seamlessly worked into the game via "waking up" from a nightmare or something along those lines.  There are various penalties for playing poorly (IE. Not being able to sprint as long) so playing carelessly is not recommended.\n\nThere is a bit of humor I enjoyed as well as some really gruesome scenes that were difficult to watch, even in pixel graphic style.\n\nThe game keeps a great pace with its "shift" mechanic where you get to explore during your night shift for work until you are too tired and have to fall asleep so you get in a mad dash to find clues while you can.  There is a helpful timer you can few by pushing T which was nice to have.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is that I didn't see the twist regarding the monster element of the game until I put the pieces together in my head and I hadn't seen this used in any other games.  A fresh take in a world of all zombie games all the time was welcome.\n\nLong story short (too late) Uncanny Valley is a great game with solid replay value and definitely worth getting if you like suspense/horror/pixel games.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a free copy of this game prior to release for review purposes but was in no way paid or otherwise compensated for my review.

You play as a guy named Tom who for some reason you will likely find out later (or by looking it up on youtube...) has decided to move to ♥♥♥♥ing nebraska or some ♥♥♥♥. It's pretty much just "guard simulator" if you just do the objectives that are obviously given to you. However there's a point where you need to do something in the apartment building and the game is a little unclear on what it is. If you don't mind spoilers, google it. Now you can get bored like I almost did at first and try to leave via subway but uh... well you'll find out on your own.\n\nThis game rewards exploration, mostly. I mean, it rewards you exploring as much as a horror game should but you have to work past some obstacles at points. That's perfectly fine, the obstacles kind of feel like any of the enemies from the Silent Hill series. By that I mean that the things that will hurt you are always where you want to go next. You'll find plenty of background information for the game's story if you search through the zones you're almost denied access to. Trust me, you'll want to hear and see the tapes once you find them, it really gets you invested in the setting.\n\nWhile we're on the subject of setting, it is so dreadful it hurts. I don't mean "terrible" or anything, I mean full of dread. Like, from the second you hop the fence it's just this constant feeling of impending death. Like something is waiting for you every time you open the elevator or that one night you'll be killed in the forest by the things you can see in the trailer. The best part is (usually) there's nothing there to even be scared of. That just makes it terrifying when something finally wants to hurt you. Usually that doesn't happen until you go somewhere you weren't meant to be which, let's face it, you will.\n\nHonestly, the game isn't some great blockbuster. It doesn't terrify you the way that one game would you know the one, the one that when you unplugged the console it didn't stop. The one you weren't supposed to be playing. But the thing is I think it does what it had set out to do, it builds a sense of lasting dread and even if just for a little while you might be afraid of the dark again.\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros:\nGreat atmosphere, completely dreadful and creepy\nAlways a sense of suspense in every room\nPushing boundaries is rewarded\nNot some stupid "early access" cash grab\n\nCons:\nUnless you try to push boundaries there's no danger, you could do the same thing for hours\nAfter messing with the generator the objectives are significantly less clear\nLOTS of small bugs and glitches(luckily the devs do work on fixes as they learn of them)\nLack of waifus(or is this a pro?)\n\nMaybe wait for it to go on sale to pick it up. However if you feel charitable you should definately pay full price to support the devs in future projects. Seriously, look up indie game development's economic forecast for employees. 95% of indie games don't bring in a profit and as a matter of fact 80% operate at a loss. It's all up to you\n\nI give this game a 8/10, Uncanny Valley is a very well made attempt at a new entry into the horror genre that manages to evoke a feeling I haven't felt since back in the days of point and click adventures and Silent Hill games.","August 23, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I think having the story paced over multiple days is fine, having to run back and forth between the facility and your apartment gets tedious, fast.\n\nAlso, unless I'm completely overlooking something, I think I've already discovered a bug that prevents you from achieving one of the optional objectives. There's a safe you have to open at one point that I'm pretty sure contains a key to a certain area. Based on the clues I've found, I'm 100% certain I know what the combination is *supposed* to be, but nothing happens when I input it. The story eventually still advances even if you're not able to solve this puzzle, but it's frustrating not to be rewarded if you've taken the time and effort to figure it out.\n\nI still want to explore this game in its entirety, and I do like its overall atmosphere and premise, so I hope the developers will work out some of these bugs and rough edges in the coming weeks. Sadly, I can't quite recommend it at this point in time.","April 24, 2015","false","8.8"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/paratrtl/recommended/359580/","paratrtl","Paraturtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/paratrtl/","403 products in account","Story: 6/10\nWith multiple endings, Uncanny Valley is more about understanding the small world than it is in dictating what's the primary narrative. What's neat is that each choice leads to a fairly satisfying and decent narrative that explores the world just enough to make the game feel worthwhile but also allow for a comfortable replay that doesn't feel repetative. That said, a few of the endings are quite short, while others are actually quite long, so it's hard to predict how much time you're about to sink into the game. My suggestion is to set aside a few hours before playing this game, since you may want to pursue different endings in the same binge.\n\nThe story itself has decent characters, a fairly believable progression, and an excellent atmosphere of mystery. It's borderline dreadful at times, but it isn't quite dreadful. Since this is more of a sci-fi horror than it is paranormal, I don't think I ever felt terrified or humbled, but I did feel a sense of hopelessness as things progressed.\n\nThe downside is there isn't anything here that hasn't been experienced elsewhere. That's not to downplay the general enjoyment of the game, but it means I'm not necessarily playing the game with any unique surprises that made the game stand out from other pixelated games, or horror games, or games with androids. Even beyond the realm of games, these light themes have been explored in film media so it's not a unique experience in that regard either, but the game still stands out as an interesting take on those influences. It's just neat. Really neat.\n\n\nGameplay: 5/10\nIt's relaxing, yet unsettling. A strange pairing, but blended well in an otherwise simple premise. However, some of the gameplay mechanics, similar to the story, aren't new. It's not that they aren't engaging, but rather that this game borrows from some other games, if at least unintentionally.\n\nExploration can be quite fun. I'm not a big fan of games with timers, so I found this pretty irritating, but I know it dictates some of the decisions that impact what ending someone gets, so I couldn't complain all that much.\n\nIt is to be noted that while the game is playable, I was completely unable to save. I opened this game with the intention of having a good spooky adventure, but I also wanted to push for all the achievements. I was pretty dissapointed when I found out the save function for me didn't work very well, so I ended up having to restart upon death a few times. Since the game is quite short, I didn't find this to be fatal in my gaming experience, but it still was quite bothersome.\n\n\nEnjoyment: 6/10\nI wasn't bored. I would even say I was a step above that and say it was pretty dang fun, but I haven't touched it since my binge session months ago when I was home sick from work. Either way, it's still quite fun and if you can look passed some of the bothersome aspects, the game itself is pretty neat. I'm quite interested in seeing more games from this developer, in all honesty. This game was pretty neat, and while the mechanics and story aren't all that new, it's still a fun game in its own right, and it happens to be quite spooky despite not having any stereotypical horror elements to it, such as paranormal influence or mad murderers.\n\n\nOVERALL: 6/10\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nRating System:\n10 - Fantastic\n9 - Great\n8 - Very Good\n7 - Good\n6 - Fine\n5 - Average\n4 - Bad\n3 - Very Bad\n2 - Horrible\n1 - Apalling","June 5","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To no surprise, the factory holds mysteries and secrets and you investigate those mysteries even as you're learning about what drove Tom to take a job in the middle of nowhere.\n\nThis game is all over the place for me and I ~barely~ can give it a recommend. It's got some really good points and some points that I feel detract from it. Let's start with what I liked. The art-style is retro pixel art and really well done, with good animations, character designs, and backgrounds. The music is solid and adds to the atmosphere. The controls with the Xbox 360 controls are solid, though not completely intuitive (with interaction being one button and picking up/dialogue advancement being another). The events and story are done well enough to keep interest as well. There are a lot of potential endings and ways to take the story which allow for decent replayability.\n\nThen there's the downside. First is that the devs really want you to play through the game multiple times. Fair enough. But part of the way that's enforced is to give you a cripplingly short "work day" in which to wander around the complex to pick up cassette tapes, read emails, and otherwise explore. You have 7 minutes from the time you put on your uniform until your shift is over, after which you have a couple of minutes before Tom passes out where he is. So you functionally have about 9-10 minutes to get to the complex, explore, and get back to bedroom. You'll be running everywhere, but Tom has a realistically (but frustrating) small amount of stamina. Add in puzzles that don't necessarily have really obvious solutions or interactions and it's easy to feel lost or frustrated. When the more action/stealth elements come into play, they feel very hit or miss. It doesn't always feel fair when you're sneaking around and there's a lot of "let's just change rooms until this guy disappears"\n\nThere is more good to this game than there is bad, but it feels like it could have been a much better game. Doubling the time limit would immediately make the game more fun, if not getting rid of it. There are other minor details, such as keeping your flashlight on between rooms, would have also made for a better overall experience. I still recommend the game, but only if some of the issues get fixed or the game is on sale. On a 10 point scale, I'd rate it about a 7.","October 21, 2015","true","3.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However, some big design flaws waste its potential.\n\nIn terms of mechanics, combat is extremely clunky and nearly useless, your character is fatigued quite quickly, your flashlight turns off between screens for some reason, text boxes quite often overlap, and moving pullable objects is oddly clunky.\n\nReplaying the game is discouraged by extremely tedious first days full of long, unskippable dialogue. Once you explore the first part of the building (which should take no longer than 40 min on your first playthrough), there's no reason to ever check it out again. The day is extremely short and much of it is spent running back and forth which only adds a frustrating sense of being rushed. Any excitement of replaying the game is quickly replaced with dread of replaying the first part of the game again. Once you know what to expect, any sense of horror is gone and it becomes a chore.\n\nThe puzzles feel a little out of place, and break the pace and immersion of "horror." The puzzles become more uninteresting as the game progresses. Eventually the objects you need to progress are placed close to where you need to use them.\n\nOddly, the "consequence system" didn't seem to be as important as advertised. While each playthrough of mine was different, a vast majority was the same. The alternate events just seemed like standard small cause-and-effect events that any game should have, rather than being a selling point.\n\nDISCUSSION ABOUT STORY BELOW\nContrary to most other reviewers here, my friends and I found the story to be pretty basic and typical. The small cast of characters makes the general plot pretty easy to put together. Once you listen to all the tapes and read a few emails, you should be able to put it all together at the end of your first playthrough.","May 9, 2015","false","3.6"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

It seems due to a lack of funding this game became literally half of what it should have been.

The prospect of multiple ending is nice, but the storylines collide more often than not and leave the player confused. The first time I played it I got the extremely bad ending without understanding who are the charachters involved. That is a huge disadvantage for a plot based game.

It surely felt like a bug. Also the menu that appears when pressing esc put which you put away by pressing space seems something out of a bizarro world guidebook.

I could be wrong but I doubt it. The way the "sleepy time" is announced and comes over the dialogue you might be having leaves some coding to be desired.\n\nThe absence of feedback and polish is just there.

Whenever you fail at something, the game goes on, but with harsh consequences for your character that can impact both the story and the gameplay. For example - you fail at avoiding your attackers, meaning your character will move slower throughout the game, making it harder to escape future pursuers, so the player needs to be careful and more clever, which adds more tension to the game.\n\nOf course, there are a couple of sections where you can die, but we're trying to avoid that as much as possible.\nWhy? Because dying and repeating the same section over and over is tedious and leads to frustration. The game stops being scary if you're angry and just want to rush through it, so we think that adding such a system will still keep the tension while adding a new layer to scariness.

I feel cheated.\n\nWhy in a game I'm supposedly meant to play multiple times is the intro day not skippable? This is a real bonehead design flaw but to be honest the whole 'work/sleep' game half feels like chafe to me anyways. If I was more cynical I might wonder if it was added to artificially elongate the game. The actual game, the part that got me interested enough to buy this mostly empty security guard simulator is short. The whole game should have been built around the lower levels, that's what the demo promised.\n\nAlso the game is filled with what I wouldn't even call bugs but rather amateurish design oversights. If you hit continue at the title screen without a save the game sort of crashes and brings up a generic window saying 'error no save state' This really makes your game look like a piece of crap and it's the first thing that happened to me on start up. I can bring up my inventory no matter whats happening. During cutscenes, while reading emails, while inside othe menus. That should be disabled. Why? cause it looks bad. It looks bad when I'm entering a code for the safe and whenever I push down my character visibly ducks.\n\nAlot of those oversights are simple fixes but even if they ironed them out the game can't be salvaged because there isn't enough game to be salvaged.\n\nThis has been a big disappointment.","June 7, 2015","false","3.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

I came across the audio logs, and I was thinking "holy cow, this is great. Where are the rest?"\n\nI had found all of them, in only one day, which kinda makes the point of them kinda fall short. It is as if they hired voice-actors, then half-way through, ran out of money to keep them on staff.\n\nAnother point, is the objectives and the reactions to them.\n\nAt one point, the power goes out. I failed to fix it, and the response to this is that,  Buck goes out to fix it, and ends up dead. You can later find his body, still soaked in blood, in the same room,  and when Tom finds the outcome, there is literally no response to it from him. Not even a shrug. He does interact with the only other thing in the room, with mild disinterest. Another early objective is so vague, it's hard to actually figure out where you're supposed to go, and I've seen this with other players as well.\n\nAs well, I don't know why he has to be a "security guard". I had assumed his role would have been given more importance, but all the actions  in the game could have been done by a "random Joe, who just strolled past the building".\n\nOf course, it's supposedly supposed to be played with multiple runs, but it just falls a bit to short to really feel the need to do that.\n\nAs well, I want to note how terrible Tom's life is. He gets up when it's pitch dark out, and goes to sleep when it's pitch dark out. He has no life, besides working.","May 11, 2015","false","2.2"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","5"

You have a strict time limit each night to do anything and the game will progress whether you do anything or not. I spent a couple of nights exploring and reading emails to get a general idea of what was going on, then all of a sudden some guys show up and take me to an area I still couldn't access. Next thing I know I'm getting chased by a baddy I can't fight or avoid, and when it eventually killed me the game ended. I'm guessing I messed something up somewhere, but with the strict time limits and the game outright snatching control away from me I have no idea what I did wrong. The developers encourage multiple playthroughs, but since the game took over so soon, any subsequent playthroughs would just end up the exact same way.","December 1, 2015","false","2.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Even with repeated playthroughs the first part becomes a grind.\n\nThe enemies are relentless and are almost impossible to avoid. Escaping is even more frustrating. Self-defense not an option as the gun is easy to miss and not of much help.\nWorse , past a point , being killed by an enemy doesn;t get you a second chance. You get the bad ending and that's that - start again.\n\nMy only advice would be to keep a constant backup of the games "save.ini" in the steam\steamapps\common\Uncanny Valley location. That way there is less backtrack.( and no , this is not like FTL or Binding of Isaac where the world changes with each playthrough. I see no reason for pushing the player all the way back to the start for a pointless grind of the first part)","April 23","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The endings also qualify with the one mentioned above. I wasn\'t totally scared at all but it certainly did alright.\n\nWhat I didn\'t like;\n- No skips\nNot being able to skip/speedthrough the first couple of minutes of the game where you have to watch the credits, get to the work place, and mess around for a couple before things can actually happen. It\'s so tedious I wished there was a flow chart liek from Virtue\'s Last Reward/chapter select where you jump to the part where you actually have some influence on the story. Replaying the game? Sure that\'s fine. Replaying a part of the game that I\'ve seen? Not fine.\n- Glitches\nThe only glitches I\'ve seen is that if you interact too fast the text in the text box actually blend togerther to where you can\'t read anything, Also sometimes if you play the game too fast or do something weird your characters disappear.\nIn my first playthrough I kept making your character go to sleep in bed(by accident) and I wasn\'t punished for it. In fact it felt like I trapped the game in a loop because I had no need to go do the security job afterwards and the timer never starts counting again. Oh and when I got the objective to go fix something, I wasn\'t allowed to fix the thing I was told to fix(thankfully it didn\'t matter).\n- Lack of real consequences\nThe conseqeuence gameplay sounds like a good idea once again but they never really did anything with it. As with the continous sleeping I made Tom go through and never got punished at his job at all, which on that note you don\'t need to do shifts everyday there\'s no point from what I\'ve played aside from finding info on the company through tapes and emails. As for avoiding combat there\'s not much to say just don\'t get hit.\n- The text\nThe text isn\'t hard to read, buuuuuuuut sometime the text choice for these games can go kiss my boot to the face because they can be hard to read sometimes.\n- Your character\nFor a guy that looks like he\'s in his mid 20s he\'s such a pusshi, running out of breathe quickly, getting tired and SLEEPING ON THE SPOT(then later teleported to his bed). Your character is such a wimp.\n- The horror\nI know I said the horror is alright, but that\'s the thing. It\'s just alright. The horror in the real world in the game are just meh and you quickly find out what the horror is and after that you\'re just fighting something out of James Cameron\'s nightmare *hint hint\n- Confusion\nThe notepad that keeps track of your object are sometimes not clear like when I was suppose to meet up with a character, there was a note, but in the notepad it doesn\'t tell/remind you of where to meet that character. Also the game could have been more helpful by telling me I picked up because I found some bandages that look like ammo but I never noticed that until I replayed it which could have helped me.\n\nOverall Uncanny Valley can be interesting and I would urge you to give it a chance. But I can\'t in good conscience recommend it in it\'s current form and price it\'s being sold at and that you should get it on sale.","May 31","false","5.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
