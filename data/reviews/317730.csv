It looks bad, during the docking sequence there is no weight, you can crash without damage, it runs poorly on my somewhat aged PC but it should be able to handle it no problem. It takes multiple attempts to launch the game, I can run it once before the .exe goes missing again.\n\nand the dev... the dev censors people in his forum, which he wiped multiple times. He banned my friend for mentioning War Thunder once which he claimed was advertising. He banned me too ( hello dev!  try censoring this! ) almost all the threads are locked, or they get removed.\n\nHere's the best part : Task manager tells me this is the DEMO. thats right. This developer has had numerous delays in releasing, valve gave him an ultimatum so he REUPLOADED THE PUBLIC DEMO, which some people have had their antivirus warn them IS A TROJAN.\n\nYou can ban me and my friend, silence critics and censor negativity, but who will have the last laugh? That would be Jim F**king Sterling, Son.","July 31, 2015","false","0.8"," 211 of 305 people (69%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","69","211","305","30","36"

One update, and it does nothing. "Added level Drift" NOPE Added a frozen screen after you turn a valve. I guess that was the update. They added an additional objective. The fuel pump freezes and 35% and asks you to stabilize pressure or something. So you leave the fuel pump thing and turn a valve. Then it shows a short cut scene and then a splash screen. The objectives states "escape the station", but you can't do anything. I know, I played through it 4 extra times to make sure I didn't mess up or something.

Something goes wrong in the process and there's an explosion, and the protagonist can only escape by jumping into a lunar module spaceraft. After this the camera follows this spacecraft's (which looks like the Eagle of the Apollo 11 mission) flight -- or rather fall -- over a lunar landscape, but it doesn't seem to be controllable at all other than some tiny bursts of the RCS (maneuvering thrusters), but even these bursts don't affect the course. After a few seconds the spacecraft crashes into a rock, and the next moment you're back in the main menu, without any explanation or indication as to what happened, or if there's anything else you could try.\n\nThe game doesn't even have the tutorial which the demo had, so even though it looks very pretty, as there seems to be no content to it, I asked for a refund because sadly this is a vaporware. :(","December 28, 2015","false","0.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

Unfortunately I can't really recommend you guys this game, yet. It's the shortest demo/alpha I ever played, but nevertheless I also definitely can't give this game a thumbs down! There' is so much promising realistic space sci-fi survival adventure atmosphere in this game and I really enjoyed the 37mins. But 14 bucks for 37mins is a tough call...and from what I've read on the forums, this state of the game is like that for almost a year now. That's why I can't recommend this game yet - on the other hand because of the beautiful preview I just played I also wouldn't think of thumbing it down. I really hope & wish that this game gets finished!!!\n\nPros:\n+ very promising atmosphere*\n+ promising gameplay*\n+ promising story*\n+ very good graphics\n+ good audio\n+ good controls (keyboard&mouse)\n\nCons:\n- *really f###ing short => 36mins\n- hope it's not a fraud (...visit the forums)\n- it's more like an interactive tech demo, atm\n- no controller support, yet\n- no invert mouse, yet\n- no key remapping, yet\n- no english spoken audio\n(if you really mind, but the astronaut is a Russian guy!)\n\nOnly buy if you like to support the dev OR if you don't have any expectations AND/OR believe that the game will get finished.","March 10","true","0.6"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","3"

The majority of your time will be spent wondering what you are supposed to be doing.\n\nIn total, if you take out all the wandering around looking for a computer to interact with, this 'game' has about 15 minutes of gameplay. Most of which seems to be deliberately slowed down, to inflate even that number.\n\nWhile the game itself looks pretty good (Unreal 4), there's just no substance here. At all. And it hasn't been updated since October of 2015.\nI picked this game up on 50%, and it should be worth nothing that this is the first game I ever returned from Steam. For $7.\n\nStay away.","February 9","false","0.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","0"

I will change it when i see fit but as of now there are only 3 levels, about an hour od gameplay.

AS THE REST OF THE CONTENT IS ADDED I WILL UPDATE THIS REVIEW. YOU SHOULD TRY OUT THE DEMO!\n\nDocking with ISS Zeus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBIFvdZAlYw\n\nThe game is not complete at this time. There are three missions. You dock with the ISS, ♥♥♥♥ gets real, and you head to the lunar surface. No other content available as of Jan 11th.\n\nThe atmosphere is amazing. This game is perfect for a VR headset and I'd imagine it'd really get your heart pounding. The fear and isolation of being involved in a space disaster really does come across to you (well it did you me anyways.)\n\nWhile there is plenty of room for improvement, I think this game could be great.\n\nPros:\n- Atmosphere\n- Graphics\n- Controls (simple)\n- Story (what exists)\n\nCons:\n- Interactive moments are lacking to the point where they are almost pointless\n- English subtitles are HORRIBLE and need to be re-written\n- Needs english voice-over (reading the bad subtitles is distracting from the action)\n- Better outline of a players game progress (where you are, where you're going)\n- Better define what content is available and what is yet to come\n\nP.S. If you purchase the game TODAY you will feel as if it is a bit buggy. The game also cuts short after the 3rd chapter / section leading you to think it is glitched.

And the official early access build is still just the demo.
