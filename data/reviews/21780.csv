The driving is so smooth and enjoyable in this game that i can just sit back and cruise 1970s New York listening to amazing songs. That brings me to my next point, the soundtrack. The soundtrack in this game is phenomenal, with the likes of David Bowie and War in the 1978 soundtrack plus the Audio bullys and Yeah Yeah Yeahs in the 2006 soundtrack. The cars are brilliant in this game, they are all easy on the eye (especially the Cerrano, Zartex and the Andec) Overall this game is brilliant, it derserves praise. so called 'PRO' reviewers like Gamestop sicken me with thier review calling the story "flat"","November 13, 2013","true","52.1"," 73 of 76 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","73","76","0","0"

Just a hands down fantastic soundtrack to go along with racing and workin' for da man. I thought the campaign story turned out to be really good, although the majority of side missions are pretty weak. The ability to teleport using the map to any location is a really nice feature and takes out the mundaneness of driving long distances. The steering and car handling is a little over-sensitive, but just takes a little patience and practice. For an older game, Parallel Lines has aged fairly well and there's still plenty of moxy left in it--quite enjoyable and certainly a game worth finishing.","December 12, 2013","true","11.3"," 33 of 36 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","33","36","0","0"

Althou, as a veteran of the Driver series you may notice that many of the game content is from Driv3r, like sounds, physics and the entire engine. But that is not a bad thing, Driv3r was a very good game in it's time, it was just pulled down by the fact that it was a kind of a GTA ripoff. Driver: Parallel lines instead goes back to the Driver-roots. This game shines with an well sold storyline with an intensional twist and good drving-physics, in deneral the atmosphere is very believeable. Personally I'd like more cars like the Cerrano with an awesome V8-sound, but that's just a personal opinion. Overall a very good game and a must for all Speed Junkies/Diver-fans/car enthusiasts.","August 10, 2014","true","42.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingTimDee/recommended/21780/","KingTimDee","King Tim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KingTimDee/","133 products in account","So firstly off the bat I should say I have WAY more playtime on this, but I recently bought it on Steam and haven't played that much, so don't go ''OMG u only haev 2 hrs, wtf m8'' on me.\nSo. Driver® Parallel Lines.\nThis was one of the first games I ever played on my computer and I absolutely adored it.\nIt is one of the most underrated Driver games, and I recently even saw some hate on it which was really unecessary to be honest, cus this is one of my favorites from the Driver series.\nSo the price is in fact aswell really low and I think you should get it, cus it's worth it.\nNow, let's go over the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n-Open World\nMeaning you can explore the city of New York, which has neighbourhoods that exist in real life (Bronx,Queens,etc)\n-A SH*TLOAD of cars\nAbout 94/95 vehicles in this game, including bikes and cars.\n-Customization\nWell, almost all (if not all) of the 94/95 vehicles are highly customizable, ranging from 4 (5 in some cases) custom bodyworks with paintjobs (or without) , accessories (tinted windows, bulletproof tires and glass) , colours (4/5 default, also there's an option for custom colors, making it with the ''RED,GREEN,BLUE'' filter), nitrous, upgrades to engines,brakes,acceleration and such (almost like the pre-GTA V, GTA V)\n-Loads of weapons\nWell by loads I mean about 11 or 12. So yeah. Loads.\n-Vast enviroment\nThe enviroment is actually giving a sense of life with people doing casual thing such as buying donuts at stands or jacking cars. No NPC police chases tho. Shame.\n-Graphics\nNow yes, graphics. This sh*t looks mighty fine for an '07 game dude, like really good.\n-Cheats\nThere are some cheats which can spice up the gameplay. There is the usual godmode cheat, the ''all vehicles in garage'' cheat (same for guns) and it actually kinda makes the game better. About 9/10 great cheats, I think.\n-Story\nNow yes the story is divided into two different timezones. 1978 and 2006.Both offer new vehicles and weapons along with missions. The missions are both fun and most importantly not just stuff to fill the gaps in between the timezones. The cutscenes are quite a bit different from the graphics of the real game but they look nice so I don't really care\n-Thrill Cam\nSo yea that's a cam which goes into this ''Thrill'' mode and just thrills the sh*t out of my cam. Nifty stuff.\n-The soundtrack\nOh the soundtrack. One of the best I've ever seen. Its like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but for your ears. An eargasm.\nGet it? Get it? Mah f*ck you too then.\n\nCons:\n-Bugs\nA few minor bugs such as getting stuck on a f*cking lightpost. Nothing game-breaking tho.\n\nTo this 8-year old masterpiece, I give a 10/10. One of my top 10 games of all time.","January 2, 2015","true","3.5"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","23","26","0","2"

Never board whether its in 1978 or 2006. This game is definently is a blast from the past literally. Everyone says this is kind of a GTA clone but heres the facts. Driver games have always been like this since the 1990s. The free roam has always been with the Driver series and to be honest the Driver series has always been great. This game is alot of fun. Car costumizing is pretty fun the races can be fun. The controls are decent just be careful and don't over steer on corners. Theres a good selection of cars and the plot line is done pretty well.

The game when it came out of its time definatly rivaled Gta. Despite not being able to use planes or helicopters it ain't no problem.  The amount of hours just messing about and happy with the meyhem it kept on achiving. The story is fantastic im not gunna lie if you havn't played it before you'll be hooked on it.

Being raised on these games through my childhood and being intensely drawn into 70's music and culture, this game was exactly where I wanted to be. You play as T.K. a getaway driver in New York in 1976. The selling point was that T.K. gets betrayed by his gang of robbers and goes to jail and comes out in 2006, seeking nothing but vengeance and being as sharp behind the wheel as ever. An exciting game with a good story, the best driving physics, great music, and incredible graphics during the cutscenes.

This game is just not playable as it keeps crashing.\n\nI'll refrain from any comparison because the first two Driver installements had so much magic in my eyes that Parallel Lines simply can't compete. So, how does it stand on its own?\n\nRather fine really. It's more of a GTA than a Driver, but it's not a bad thing. Especially when you can drive bikes and helicopters. To this day, the game still looks more than acceptable. I can't say the graphics bothered me, except maybe the face models, which isn't really that important for a driving game.\n\nNow the story is kinda usual. You get betrayed and decide to take your revenge. You know the drill. It just works!\n\nThe OST is absolutely fantastic so long as you stick to the seventies. The modern era OST is absolute garbage, which is rather sad in my opinion. Some great stuff got released that year, why did they solely focus on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ electro?\n\nAnyway, let's get to the PC release.\nThe game is pretty much entirely customizable. It supports up to a 4k resolution, you can edit the graphical options and what not, even the driving sensitivity. Which I heartily recommend if you're playing with a gamepad because the sensitivity is a bit too high. Also, I'd suggest lowering the circulation because you simply can't drive any fast without crashing with the default options.\n\nBUT THEN. The game keeps crashing all of the ♥♥♥♥ing time. Get out of the garage? Crash. Finish a mission? Crash. Failed a mission and wish to restart? Crash. I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. Luckilly, the game saves automatically everytime you do something. But still, that perpetual crashing really makes finishing the game a chore.\n\nI'd say pick it up on sale, but it's already 5 bucks so yeah, if you need a fix of GTA like, go for it.","March 26","false","7.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/21780/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","The music chosen for this game was perfect. Every single track is excellent. Pure hits! The soundtrack alone is worth what I paid for this game. At least for the 70s era part. The 00s era's music they chose is 95% garbage, but it does make it funny sometimes. New York has been created and rendered exceptionally well. The streets, the alleys, the cars, and all other parts of the environment are nicely done. The day and night cycles also look very nice. The cinematics are also done in a film-like fashion, that involves the player from the very beginning. All characters portrayed are quite interesting, and their voice acting is outstanding. Driver: Parallel Lines has the perfect mood, atmosphere, setting, sounds, and interactions to make you feel like you are truly in the game. Controlling any of the vehicles can be close to impossible without crashing them and eventually making them a complete loss. You will lose control of the vehicles easily. This makes the idea of spending money to upgrade cars you own almost completely wasteful and pointless. The game is extremely difficult. I've had to do missions many, many, many times over until I was successful. The untameable vehicle controls are to blame, in conjunction with the sometimes necessary simultaneous shooting. Repeating many of the missions over, and over, and over gets frustrating, repetitive, and extremely annoying. Often, it is infuriating how unforgiving the game is, with its control and handling issues. The speedometer keeps track of the total amount of miles you have traveled in-game, which is not useful, but pretty cool. Mouse sensitivity in the menus is horrible. Making changes in the settings will do little to make the menus useable by your mouse. Expect to choose menu options with the keyboard. The save system is based on completed missions. So, if you quit during the second part of a five parts mission, for example, you will be forced to start the mission from the very beginning next time you load the game, which is ridiculous. All vehicles take visible damage as you drive around the city like a complete lunatic, with very little care for public safety or your own. The chases and crashes are intense and look straight out of a Hollywood movie. The missions are diverse, challenging, exciting, and agitated even though this is primarily a driving game. Investing money into your owned vehicles and altering them is not forced upon the player, with the exception of one mission. Certainly, if you do buy upgrades, your driving will be temporarily made easier and better, but this is totally optional. Especially because money is hard to come by, and the upgrades or parts are expensive. Spend your money on ammunition instead. Several missions involve precision vehicular platform gaming. This means that you will have to slowly and carefully steer your car on ramps and other on ground structures. There are often hilarious AI controlled accidents that occur throughout the game. Because the missions are so difficult to complete successfully, you will develop hate for your enemies and the police. When you finally defeat them, you will rejoice in glory and relief. If you have much patience, and can forgive the game's excessive difficulty and problematic controls and handling, this is a great game. You will experience excitement, variety, and lots of fun. After the campaign is beaten, several vehicles are unlocked and put into your garage. You are also free to roam New York in both eras and do the money making side missions.\n\nDriver Parallel Lines is great.","March 20, 2014","true","22.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is fun when you can play it, but i have tried for countless hours to play this game without it crashing, i have have tried playing it on 3 diffrent computers, some old, some new, and i have tried to find diffrent fixes, but none of them work. Lets list a few of the instances when your game has a chance of crashing, it can crash when you restart a mission or level, when you go to the main menu, when you boot up the game, when you era switch, or just randomly during a game session. I have no idea why this is happening because i am over the minium system requirements to play this game, and i don't know why there are so little reports of this happening, AND i dont know why this isnt being patched... So if you want to play this game, play it on the playstation or xbox, dont waste your money here...","June 4","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
