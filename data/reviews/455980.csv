I say "eventually", since their job priorities are all based on their skills and how you arrange their priorities in their profiles.\n\nAt the moment, some micro manegement is definitely needed to prevent colonists from starving or dying from dehydration.\n\nRemember to create a water fetching job at the well and arrange colonist priorities to actually fetch water eventually. If you don't, they'll happily research themselves to death.\n\nCurrently, death from a lack of food/water is swift and hard to catch in time when your colonists start dropping. Learned the hard way that I had to pay attention. Sorry about that, first colonists.\n\nMy second colony went better, until it got overrun by Reapers.\n\nThird colony died of starvation again.\n\nFourth colony was annihilated by Imps when a stary survivor lead them in my direction, straight after a failed rescue attempt left me with only 1 injured colonist. Yes... Death... Lots of it...\n\nThe menu does warn you when choosing "normal" difficulty and I have been fittingly punished for assuming this was just a warning for the faint of heart. No. It's hard. Ever tried Resident Evil 1 knife challenge? That kind of hard.\n\nOr maybe I'm doing it wrong??\n\nStill recommend trying this game out!!!!\n\n\n\nTLDR:\n\nUnforgiving simulation with a nice roadmap.\nIt's one of those games you either love or hate, depending on your mental state! :)","April 11","true","1.6"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","71","35","49","5","0"

The upgrades can be difficult to get, and the system is somewhat obscure. In order to get the upgrade you want to make something, you need to HAVE some of that stuff already! To be able to mine, for example, to get metal, you have to first have some metal to unlock mining! It's like that for a number of upgrades.\n\nTo get the stuff for unlocks, you need to travel to a location and scavange what you need. Combat will take place there, and you get the items if you kill the enemies. Then you automatically go back to base and if you have the right ingreedients, you can then upgrade.\n\nCombat is the weakest part of the game right now. It's pretty watery, with no options apart from movement and a base attack. Hopefully the combat will be upgraded in the future.\n\nSome of the tech tree isn't ready yet, no worries, you get a good idea of what's coming.\n\nAs well as crafting upgrades, there is magic. So far the magic that I've unlocked just lets me make it rain, grow trees and get other mundane resorces. There is a spell I've just unlocked that apparently lets you find survivors, but I haven't seen any options to be able to use that so far.\n\n\nYour base will get invaded with increasing frequency by creatures of increasing difficulty. If you don't keep up by training your peeps and giving them better weapons, plus getting other survivors to join, you *will* die. This IMHO could do with toning down, but Early Access.\n\nI would say keep an eye on it and see how it goes. They have a great framework here, and it is very playable so far, but if you already have Rimworld then there really isn't much here right now to differentiate this game from that.","April 13","true","5.4"," 27 of 37 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","27","37","0","2"

It's rough to figure out just how much food you need to generate to support your colony. It wouldn't be a problem if farms weren't so resource intensive and resourses were such a pain to gather. This is the basic run down of my first settlements:\n\n1: Oh no, I'm not generating enough food!\n2: Oh no, I don't have enough trees to build another farm!\n3: Oh no, I have to grow more trees, wait for them to grow, chop them down, build another farm, wait for the veggies to grow and hope some one is still alive to harvest them!\n4: Oh no, I'm out of water and my basecamp didn't spawn with a well! I need to research woodworking so I can make a furnace so I can make bricks so I can build a well!\n5: Oh no, I need more trees to make a saw mill to make boards to make bricks so I can build a well and I chopped all the trees down so I could build more farms so my people don't starve! I need to plant more trees so I can maybe save someone!\n6: Oh no, Everyone is dead.\n\nthis wouldn't be as big of an issue if it weren't for the fact that it takes so long to figure out that you're doing it wrong and the first thing you have to do is plant trees right there next to your base because the AI for the tasks system is rudimentary and can't handle the size of the base map in the beginning. Get ready to watch your survivor start to walk over to a pile of clay, get 3/4 of the way there, realize he's hungry, turn back to gets something to eat, finish eating and start heading back to the clay, get half way there, realize he's tired, then go wait for the only bed to open up.\n\nThe combat system could stand a bit of tweaking as well.\n\nI get what they're trying to accomplish with the cover system, but it comes off a little cumbersome. It's wierd to watch a guy crouching by a barrel while an imp is wailing away at him 2 feet away. The tutorial makes a big deal about "flanking" but the enemy AI just bum rushes you every time they see you. Maybe I didn't get far enough into the game play to see the more advanced enemies, but over all the combat came off as tedious to me.\n\nAll that being said, The bones are there. I can see this being a good time sponge. I know as soon as I post this review I'm going to start the game up again and start over. I know that it's a work in progess and I can't wait for it to be done, but I think most people SHOULD wait. I cannot reccomend that my friends buy it now because I can see the potential for them being infuriated by it, but once it's been tweaked I would be more than happy to change my oppinion.\n\n","April 14","false","14.7"," 39 of 62 people (63%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","63","39","62","11","0"

It has the familiar features of food and water for survival and resource processing for getting building and resource processing up. So far, so good. And perhaps, so normal, however there are some fun wrinkles that Judgement introduces into the genre that might catch your attention: Firstly, there are tactical, pausable battles where survivor placement matters and secondly, there's a world map where you can send survivors off to capture resources.\n\nI've been enjoying the game (see videos below), however some people might find the small, indie and low-budget nature of the title a touch offputting. I'd resally advise checking out some videos of the game in action and deciding if it's for you that way.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoQC7gbRVmU&list=PLCymfyavV-yMysPcgczO9jSmu240Bx4ja\n\n","April 28","true","3.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The demons in the game are the most generic stuff you can think about.

In Judgment, you constantly manage tasks in order to make sure your people have adequate food, water, and crafting supplies. This entails chopping wood, visiting the water well, and farming. These activities take place on a local 'town' map.\n\nBut eventually you will need more than you can initially supply so will then visit the world map and send teams to forage for food, medicine, and other supplies. When you visit various locations you can only secure the loot after successfully defeating all the enemies at that location. So this means you must forge weapons and armor.\n\nThe game additionally has an already extensive tech tree. In all, Judgment has a good flow of the usual gather, craft, survive loop that has become so common in games. What makes it interesting here are two things: 1) the town mangement makes you really feel like you are overseeing the well-being of your community. 2) much more interestingly,  Judgment's backdrop is occult as compared the to the now standard zombie fare. You will eventually research occult tech in order to unlock mystical weapons, etc.\n\nIn all, Judgment is making a stellar first impression. i will update this review as I plug in the many more hours I know the gmae will draw out of me.","April 22","true","7.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

As it stands, the game is very bare-bones and to be honest feels and looks very much like a cheap mobile game.\nThe combat is shallow and clumsy and feels more like playing really old RTS games where you just drag everyone and send them at the hardest enemy. Not much strategy to employ as they move so slowly and awkwardly it is very hard to position them properly during combat. I thinkk it needs to actually be turn based rather than the way it is atm as it just does not handle well enough the way it stands.\nThe crafting and researching is fine and looks promising, but at the moment quite a lot of it is locked off and waiting to be implemented. That's not a terrible thing, but added to the other niggles and overall look, I am going to say this game is not recommended at this time.\nKeep your eyes on it and hopefully it will get a lot better, but as of right now £10 is actually way too much for what this game offers.","April 15","false","2.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

Now with the standard PMC and terrorist checklist clogging mainstream gaming like a bad case of constipation, demons have wandered back into their burrows waiting for a chance to rise again. With the release of Judgment: Apocalypse Survival Simulation into the Early Access market, they have a chance to invade the surface again. Will this be enough to overcome the shortcoming of development or force the surviving party into exile?\n\nSurvival simulators are a clear dime in a dozen with Early Access and right off the bat the game separates itself by being a overhead base builder. You start with three randomly generated characters with plus/minus stats to gather, build, craft, research, farm and fight your way through the story. The story is pretty simple at the moment and acts more like a "what to do next" prompt than an actual story. It is secondary compared to the base building which includes everything from houses to guard towers and of course crafting tables (workbench, furnace, stove). Most of these cannot be built until they researched, which is done by using a survivor to either use science or the occult to progress further into the tier trees. About half of these tiers are still in development (coming soon), but it gives you an idea of what to expect. Thankfully, the game is highly replay-able with randomly generated maps to start in.\n\nBuilding is only possible though if you have the right materials to get the job done. While the base map has what you need to start, some materials cannot be gathered without having it first. This is done through the scavenging system, which involves using the overlay map to go to another area and fight demons for listed items. This same overlay map is used to rescue other survivors that pop up every once in awhile. This process of scavenging and survivor rescue is crucial in order to stand a chance against the demons that randomly attack your base in increasing difficulty. Food, water and sleep are also factors, so combined with everything else you can expect to be busy while building up to take the fight to the demons. This micro management is what keeps the game flowing though and is quite addictive in a "I cannot wait to unlock and make this" sort of way. There are some periods of downtime, but thankfully there is a enhancement tool to increase the speed of the game.\n\nBase management is quite enjoyable, but what about the combat? The system used is similar to a real time tactical approach where you place your survivors and let them auto-attack against the demons. Based on combat skill and weapon type, the chance to hit increases, so a bit of luck is involved considering the demons really just charge in without thought. The base attacks are the same, but with the use of guard towers and blockades you can at least create choke points to make things interesting. It could really use some work to feel more fluid, but it works in the least. Hopefully the scavenging mission maps can be more diverse (about three to four maps used).\n\nGenerally, discussing performance and technical aspects of a game leads into a dark rant about optimization, but this time around the game works surprisingly well. I have not run into any real slowdown or frame rate drops, but that could be due to the simple (yet refreshing) game aesthetic. That doesn't mean the game is without it's bugs. On some occasions when a survivor left a gathering or research task, the display would still show the gathering icon as if you were gaining the material. Enemy units would not move even if standing a couple of tiles from a survivor and some actions require multiple button attempts to register (survivors in the retreat box not retreating when hitting the button for example). The AI used for determining the hierarchy of duties can also overlook when say trees need to be chopped, but the survivor quarries clay instead (even though chopping trees is a higher priority). It could be a hell of a lot worse though.\n\nEdit #1:\n\nThe length of the game can be questionable with the relative lack of a story. The game has no general end without the difficulty ending it for you. Once the hell gate is discovered and dealt with, there is no real point of going on except to experience items you have yet to unlock. Until the story gets extended and new content is added, the time spent on a single play through is cut short by the lack of perspective and objective. It is certainly lacking content at this point, but it functions rather well for what is offered.\n\nPros\n\n- Base building is simple and enjoyable\n- Challenging micromanagement (staying up to par against increasing demon strength)\n- Refreshing aesthetic (not pixelated thankfully)\n\nCons\n\n- Some random bugs\n- Combat could use some fine tuning\n- Lack of general content and objective","April 19","false","19.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I still do, only I can't play too often or I get bored.\nWhy? Because it's a small game. There's really only one way to win this game, one road to walk to reach the end.\nFirst time I played, I thought that the human and demon technology operated separetly, and you could play one or the other.\nGrave mistake, actually you start with human, and end with demon tech.\n\nThis is what I really don't like in this game, there's only one road you can take to win, so when you restart ur game, you'r basically repeating the actions you did previously.\n\nAbout the fights, I like the mechanisms, only wish there was more available weapons. Also, when you fight at designed locations, kill some demons, and then retreat, the demons respawn, which is nonsensical because when you'r fighting against an army of demons, unless you've packed your survivors with medkit, you can't kill them all in one swoop.\n\nIt's really sad because when I play, I'm always thinking of finding "the right path", the correct number of survivors to not use too many ressources, but at the same time, enough to quicken the construction and research. The right time to research in human tech tree or demon one. Scavenge ressources needed. Protect my base...\n\nEverything in this game is about making the correct decision. And you'r often wrong at first, because the right paths are limited if you'r thinking of beating this game.\n\nStill the game is only in beta, so I keep my hope that when the game is in its finished version the game mechanic will be improved.","May 31","false","7.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Either you find the loophole in the computer's strategy or you are always fighting a win to lose battle.\nBasically you end up feeling boxed in because the computer always knows your strength and auto compensates.\n\n6 hours is nothing really in a game like this. I can't guess the computer's strategy yet. Unfortunately, it always knows mine.\nDoubly bad, though not in this game, the computer can front a consistently weak team leaving you unchallenged.\n\nSo far, in this game, the other side is utterly OP, at least on my strategy - which is build a base and get strong rather than jump straight in and skirmish.\n\n\nThe game concept, though, is really good. A bit sand box, a bit scripted. I see huge potential.\n\n\nDo you want to buy this?At the moment ... maybe.\n\nIt's actually quite involving if you like XCOM style games, or even Gnomoria. It does cross genres and that makes it more interesting than just another clone.\n\nIf you have a spare tenner to chuck around .. I'd say go for it. Otherwise, wait till Witcher 3 is passe, world gold and you only have a tenner :P\n\nI think it's a good game with lots more potential.","April 13","true","6.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

You must make use of every second/resource you acquire because the demons are a coming. Determining what to prioritize and focus on will make or break your colony, and it's pretty easy to get broken. Good bang for your buck.","April 30","true","51.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I failed after roughly 10 days several times before lowering the difficulty from "Challenging" (the setting that the game recommends) to something less intense. After having to get back up to the same stage in the game only to be destroyed again, you will probably get frustrated, but at the same time probably still enjoy it.\n\nI can see myself getting a lot of replay value out of this.","May 29","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
