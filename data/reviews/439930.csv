As you lose "troop count" 1:1 for each point of damage you deal in the beginning, you have to time it rather than simply send hordes of small troops in. The ability to resize the game window to any size and shape you like is a very good boon, as long as you have at least an 800x600 display resolution for it to work. It's rather difficult in the very beginning (until you unlock perks) and at the very end (when you have to play a lot more tactically). Good for casual play on a mobile device; I suspect it was designed for one due to the wide screen, bright buttons and 'drag and drop' gameplay. Also the think European accents are a hoot for an American like me.","February 15","true","4.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","2"

It reminded me Eufloria, but instead of trees and seeds, here we have bases and guns (I love it very muсh :D). Gameplay is simple - you need capture all bases on map using units. Controls in this game - its just mouse, no need keyboard. I think only 1 thing, what I dont like - is no fullscreen (alt + enter not working), I hope devs add it in future updates.","March 2","true","4.3"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Coupled with the cool background music and various sound effects, it can feel pretty tense sometimes while playing.The surviving troop chart at the end of each level is also very interesting.\n\nThere're a fair amount of elements in this game, and the graphics are nice, fans of casual RTS games should have a try!\n","February 16","true","6.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

I lik'd 95% of the game due some facts that's a great potential about very well concept of fast thinking style game. The art, music, voice acting and graphics, gameplay are great and plus 10/10 though. On the other hand in some cases the gameplay feels unbalanced in some missions that makes harder(last levels only) even with the upgrades. Only thing i may suggest if apply is a reset upgrades/stats button if it's possible.\n\nThere's one upgrade page(Skills) in the shop which contain 14:\n\n6 troop(ground, armored and air) upgrades\n8 others heavily useful(lightning strike, nuke, freeze and backup).\n\nA tip: take the time to learn what works best for you.\nA tip: Jet Packs is mostly the key of victory.\n\nYou'll face 27 missions which will grant you 1+ star per mission so choose correctly because there isn't way to roll back the upgrades.\n\nThis game is basically about speed over any kind of strategy. You need conquer big/barracks, armorys, jumpers and towers by moving on it. Besides sometimes you need to be smart do letting the enemy decrease the number  of the capture points while you keep increasing your amount of troops so when the enemy capture point is close to 0-5 then send all your troops there making the capture very easy. It helped me a lot.\n\nAt least I haven't found any error or something that prevents normal operation of the game. The game run very smooth, it's clear and satisfactory good. I would highly recommend this game to everybody who interested in challenge your mental/hands skills. i dare you! :D","February 21","true","42.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This is where the game features a new mechanic that i never seen before, every soldier makes a certain damage to structures, other towers have an exact life, and if this an enemy one, time to time increases as ours. The life of these is based both on damage / level that our soldiers have, for example if our tower has 50 of life, the first soldier will do 18 damage, the second 11, and so is wasting away. The truth this game impressed me with this strategy, they have improve some respects, sounds are repetitive, the graphics a bit simple, but all in all is a good game.\n\n7,5/10.\n\nControl Craft 2 es un juego de estrategia ambientado en un tiempo futurista, busca que el jugador interactue con distintas torres para que logre conquistar cada una de ellas, pero hay enemigos que nos impiden tomarlas.

Good graphics, very nice, and makes the strategy genre more interesting.\n\nHowever, after the first level, everything gets TOO HARD. And when i mean "TOO HARD" i mean it. The enemy comes rapily, not giving you a chance to attack, train units, or plan anything. Even the easy level is hard. The game then has "upgrades" which is extremely confusing and not explained at all. I understand you put effort into this game, but the game needs more work, and you need to port it to mobile a bit less lazy.","March 12","true","0.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

I was angry that the game was the same as the free version available online, and that the game didn't offer anything new. Now that i've looked into the publisher and the developers, i understand that the game was released to fund updates to the game and add new features. I find this style of RTS / statergy very entertaining but it's very rare, meaning it'll be hard for you to find anything that is better than this. If you want to help this game develop then you should buy, but if you want to play a polished, content full game, then wait until a couple of updates have been released!","February 15","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm a fan of really stripped down RTS games. For example, I've played many hours of Galcon Fusion. Control Craft 2 has the bones of a game like that, with just a few changes it could be a good game. Unfortunately there are too many things wrong with it in its current form:\n\n--It's short. I played through 3/4 of the available stages in just an hour and a half with no prior experience of the game.\n--It was ported from a FTP mobile game and still retains many features of that which should have been changed. It still has banner ads in it and lacks a full screen option!\n--It is poorly documented. I still haven't figured out how to unlock a bunch of major upgrades even though I've almost completed the game. (Technically, I guess I'm not certain they can be unlocked.) This is very frustrating.\n\nSo I wouldn't recommend buying this game, not in its current form. That said, my first hour of play was a positive experience. If the developer ever wanted to clean this up for a proper PC release, I'd be interested.","May 25","false","2.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

Challenge is making you make tough descisions and being harder than "Just do what you did everywhere else," not Islands and Zeplins.  Those levels are total BS.  On Islands, Green goes over the 50 reinforcements cap while Red keeps you pressured and they don't attack each other, leaving you low on troops every time and here come 200+ green troops.  Game Over.  No way around it.  You can't capture any points because Red re-caps them and holds you off until Green destroys you.  Zeplins sends an insta-kill giant robot after you.  That doesn't add to the fun or challenge of the level, it just adds an artificial time limit, and when you lose those air-troop posts, you lose the level.\n\nAlso, this is NOT RTS!  RTS is Starcraft, Age of Empires/Mythology and the like, not this crap.  This would be better off a free game on the internet, not one to buy on Steam.","May 14","false","1.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
