It needs stuff, lots of stuff to be the game it should be.\n\nEDITS: Adding and changing some Pros/Cons/Neutrals, Arrow tower moved to neutral especially as I gave it a hard time initially.\n\nThe Pros/Cons will be ordered from what I think the biggest problems are down to little annoying things (number of -). More Pros/Cons will be added later when I've had more time to enjoy the game, right now I'm just putting down the things I noticed during my short run. And no I won't be refunding, for it's price I'm going to stick with it and see how it changes.\n\nPros\n+ The art is nice\n+ Some areas have nice music that doesn't sound terrible, but only some\n+ Levels aren't horribly designed both art and layout, nothing amazing but they do their job well enough to be passable\n+ The price isn't high, which is one of the only reasons I picked this up initially.\n\nNeutal\n+/- Arrow Tower is good, stronger than the Mage tower only thing is on some levels it still shoots the ground in front of it for no apparant reason. I'd put up pictures but I don't know how to.\n+/- Enemies pick up in number rather quickly on some levels\n+/- Enemies pay out 20 gold each\n+/- 10 levels, not a lot but not really enough\n+/- Match times are very short, in 30 minutes I've played 5-6 maps to completion\n\nCons\n----- No information on your upgrades/abilities, while you can guess/assume, you really shouldn't have to.\n--- There is no tutorial.\n-- There's no way to track your progression and there are no locked levels so there's no real sense of achievement or buildup.\n- Some of the music duing the levels, while reflecting the art style is repetitive, some sound like a 5 second loop, others are more fleshed out luckily but overall it's not that plesent (The first two stages are the worst sounding)\n- The SFX sounds aren't that great, they do their job but also suffer from being annoying like the music.\n- Limited resolution options.\n- Enemies don't vary at all, they all seem to be the exact same sprite, I checked all maps and unless there's a "Boss" at the end of the last maps 20 waves then there is no change at all.\n\nI for one can't recommend this game at its current stage, but hopefully that will change within a few updates. Because as of right now, it doesn't bring anything new, different or better to the table. But don't put it out of your mind completely, just check back on it in a week or so and see if the reviews change at all, as the game is in early access and should grow to become something better over time.","June 4","false","0.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

I would wait until the game is a tad more devoleped to buy it but it has potential","June 4","false","0.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"
