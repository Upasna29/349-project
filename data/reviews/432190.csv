With entertaining gameplay and charming presentation, for a title as reasonably priced as this you simply cannot go wrong.\n\nChef Solitaire: USA uses the golf rule set, which involves playing cards in ascending or descending order until all have been removed from the board. There's a bit more to it than that, but it's a very easy to learn version of the game that will appeal to those looking for a more relaxing experience. While there is indeed some thought needed in play, once you get the hang of things you'll be a solitaire pro in no time.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601334369\nThe game is divided into the 48 continental states, each with 10 boards to complete.  As you clear the boards, you'll earn money to purchase power-ups that will help you play cards much easier. Chaining combos is the meat of the game play as bigger chains increase your score multiplier, thus rewarding even more money at the end of each board.  But what I found most interesting is that the board objectives do not necessarily encourage you to clear all cards, which adds a bit of strategy to the play. Completing the requirements ends the stage regardless of whether or not all cards have been removed. So, if you're aiming for Perfects, many times you'll need to make a decision call on whether you should risk failure and pass over a winning card in the hope that the right cards are in your deck to get you that full clear, or simply play it to finish up and move on. Of course, luck plays a factor in the draw with particularly bad layouts often requiring several retries if you don't have enough power-ups to get through them. But that comes with the territory in solitaire.\n\nSprinkled throughout the decks are mini-game cards that reward extra money.  These timed games range from a Match-3 board to Memory Cards, but are fun little diversions that help mix things up as you play. There's an option to skip them if you choose, which I found myself doing from time to time as I zoned out to the less hectic pace of the solitaire boards, but I'd recommend doing them to build your cash for achievements.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=601334383\nThere are three difficulty levels with the hardest having a low chance for mini-games, less points awarded per board and no King to Ace conversion, which substantially increases the difficulty of the game making achievements harder to complete.  However, if you're looking for a more "pure" solitaire experience, this may just be the thing for you.  Normal should strike a good balance for most players, with Easy offering a more zen-like experience as you clear the boards with ease.\n\nThe presentation is charming with beautiful hand-painted backgrounds and character art.  Music is a highlight with jazzy piano selections serving as backdrop to the restaurant-themed levels. Well-written and entertaining journal entries are intermittently placed between states which detail the struggles and successes of the game's heroine as she conquers the US with her delicious cuisine. Altogether, this recipe makes for one tasty little card game.\n\nFans of solitaire, do not pass on this gem. For just $5, I clocked in 25 hours to 100%, and there's plenty more here if you decide to play it over again on Hard (or Easy if the mood so strikes).  This is one of the most well-rounded solitaire experiences I've had on Steam and will certainly find myself back again when I need to scratch that solitaire itch.\n\nBottom Line: Highly recommended to all solitaire and casual gaming fans.","January 26","true","25.7"," 99 of 101 people (98%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","98","99","101","5","12"

The game is easy, and very addictive as I have found, I just cant stop playing when I get started. This is a great game for when you have a few minutes to spare and want something simple and relaxing to play to help pass some time, or you can make an evening of playing this card game. This is my kind of game, and I absolutely love it. Sorry no spoilers from me, you'll just have to look the store page and take peoples words for it. Look If you really enjoy card games, then you will enjoy this game as well.\n\nPrice wise : I believe its a decent price and at the moment its 25% off so even better. It has Achievements to earn and Trading Cards as well. I'll give this game a 10/10","January 18","true","42.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","3"

A game that doesn't require full screen mode, sounds, or my full attention to play...allowing me to stop without enduring countdowns or a permanent death in game. A perfect fit while I watch/listen to a tv show that aired that night. Stopping gameplay here and there when something crazy goes down in the show.\n\nChef Solitatire: USA fits my needs perfectly. It is by far my favourite solitaire game/casual game on Steam at the moment. Not only is it visually appealing, but the story that goes with it is great too! It even has trading cards and achievements as well which is always a plus in my books.\n\nThe levels themselves are pretty straight forward. Some are easier than others. This game does have a star system where you try to obtain three stars per level. You don't have to get the full three to continue onto the next level but you do have to meet a certain quota of stars to open the next restaurant. If you enjoy casual games as I do, you won't mind doing levels over and over to get the perfect three star score.\n\nThe $5 you spend on this game is well worth it. Plenty of gameplay, mini games, and twists on certain levels. Who would of thought trying to figure out what cards to use in order to get get bacon, grease, or other antics off your cards in order to use that row would actually be fun!! xD\n\nKudos to the husband/wife dev team from The Revills Games. Steve and Kylie, you two have created an outstanding game for us gamers who enjoy playing games in this genre.\n\nCasual gamers & friends, don't pass this title up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanbuki/recommended/432190/","Zanbuki","Zanbuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanbuki/","275 products in account","I've played this type of solitaire on my phone and on my PC for years. It's something that's easy to get into and pretty addictive at the same time. That's why when I saw Chef Solitaire: USA pop up on my Steam feed, I decided that it would be a fun, casual distraction from some of the more hardcore games in my list. And I wasn't wrong.\n\nSo what is it?\n--------------\n\nChef Solitaire: USA is exactly what it says on the box: It's a solitaire game that takes place in the USA and has a restaurant theme. The game play involves finding a card that's either one higher or one lower than the one in your stack and clearing the board. There are a bunch of levels, but none of them really offer much diversity in the game play. A few add different perks to help you succeed better in the game and a few have extra obstacles that you have to overcome, but there's nothing too extreme here. And that's okay.\n\nIs there anything good about this game?\n------------------------------------------\n\nYep. It's a solitaire game, which is as addicting of a card game as you'll get. The artwork is nice, the music isn't obtrusive, and there are fun little things in the game that set it apart from others like it. The first thing that comes to my mind are the mini-games that sometimes pop up during a game. They're fun, quick, and give you a little extra money to incentivize you to do them.\nThe other fun aspect is the money system. A lot of the time you can clear a level without having to remove that many cards from the field, but by being risky and clearing more cards, you get a little more money. So what is money for? You can buy upgrades that do certain things, like reveal X% of cards on the field or let you know what your next draw is going to be.\n\nIs there anything bad about this game?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nNot really. It's a very well put-together casual card game that isn't meant to be played constantly for hours a day. It's definitely what I would call a "lunch-break" game and isn't for someone looking for an epic experience.\n\nLet's talk about the achievements.\n-------------------------------------\n\nThere are 20 achievements in Chef Solitaire: USA and they all look very easy to attain. This one should be an easy 100% for achievement hunters. Of the achievements I've gotten at the time of writing, all of them are from just playing the game. There are no esoteric play styles that you have to adapt to in order to earn that obscure achievement. It's pretty straight forward. And that's a good thing.\n\nSo, overall, do I recommend Chef Solitaire: USA?\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nAbsolutely. The game at full price is only $5 and at the time of writing, it was 25% off, which is more than reasonable for the amount of entertainment you're going to get out of this one. If you need to take a break from killing zombies or just want something that isn't too involved before bedtime, this game is definitely worth picking up. Before you know it, you'll be telling yourself "Just one more level".\n\nChef Solitaire: USA gets a resounding yes from me.","January 19","true","4.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

In an effort to open restaurants in every state in the continental US, you gather money and complete services. 48 states with 10 stages in each state provide a total of 480 services for you to complete. With nice artwork, transitions, special effects, personalization and depth, CS:USA is a great addition for any casual fan of Solitaire or card games in general.\n\nCS:USA utilizes the Golf rules (Golf Solitaire), where all building is carried out on a single waste pile. Any single, exposed card from a stack may be transferred to the waste pile if it follows either an ascending or descending sequence regardless of suit. To breakup the monotony, fun yet skippable mini-games are injected throughout the deck. A stage is completed upon achieving the required goals (1 Star, 4 Chef Hats [specifically marked cards], etc). Money and the star meter is progressed throughout the game from continuous play streaks.\n\nThere are many card/Solitaire games currently on Steam, yet CS:USA has a higher quality of production. Some of the examples of this are listed below.\n\nExamples of high quality:\nGreat artwork.\nCharacter voice-overs.\nUndo-button - card wriggles if you had a play remaining with previous card.\nMultiple difficulty levels (Casual < Normal < Hard (No K-A or Vice Versa)).\nPurchasable items: reveal remaining # of cards in deck, etc.\nPersonalization: card backs/fronts, auto-finish, cursor image.\nThe great depth in this game doesn't leave much for improvement. The only things I would have desired to see include: ability to recontinue a game in progress, Solitaire games using traditional rules.\n\n==== Score ====\nGreat\n- 9/10","May 30","true","0.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I have bought a few of the indie high/low solitaire games off of Steam, but this is by far the best.\n\nPROS:\nA ton of bang for the buck.  I have been playing this for over a week and have only unlocked 23 states or so.  Being that each state has 10 levels, that's a ton of entertainment value for the price.  Can't say how many levels in total because the USA map doesn't include Alaska or Hawaii.  Hopefully they are included after the 48th state as a bonus, but we shall see.\nGameplay is simple but strategic.  It is fun trying to use the powerups at the appropriate times to complete a level.\nMost levels are fairly easy to complete so you advance, but getting three stars on some of them is quite challenging.  I find myself at times, deliberately not getting the final chef's hat card, just to eek out enough money to get the third star.  Another very fun strategic element.\nCute "story line" running throughout the game.\nNice graphics, and decent music.\nCONS:\nOnce you get all of the powerups, the store becomes pretty much worthless.  I currently have almost $300K and nothing to spend it on.\nOn the complete level screen, it would be great to have a "Restart" button even when you advance.  It is a chore to go back through the map screen, when you only get two out of three stars and want to try the same level over again.\nOverall a solid indie solitaire game that is well worth the price of admission.\n","January 24","true","25.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
