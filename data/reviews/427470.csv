"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLagsalott/recommended/427470/","SirLagsalott","SirLagsalott","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SirLagsalott/","116 products in account","There's plenty of things to say about this game. Most of the reviews that have come out today, or will come out in the future, mostly say the same thing: "This game should have been a DLC." I agree, but since that will be the narrative of the other reviews I'd like to talk about everything else.\n\nFirst: the content from the original.\nMost of the original policies are duplicated here, with only minor changes. But the qualms I had with the old policies are the same - for example, why do technology grants reduce religious membership? No one's going to look at a computer and say "there's electricity, therefore God does not exist". Same thing with space exploration and other policies. I haven't heard a valid explanation for that.\nAdditionally, few things have been changed. Everything that isn't involved with the changed voting groups has been left untouched, and some changed systems don't justify the price tag.\n\nNow, the new content.\nThe in-game descriptions do not say why Conservatives are opposed to female mutilation bans. It's one thing to say that they oppose sex education, but to say that they support the mutilation of genitals is bizarre and a strange message to send to game players. The description of that policy is only about a sentence long, and the other descriptions give similarly vague (or nonexistant) explanations to why certain groups dislike them.\n\nI also wish there would be something to make the game *feel* different. The background is tinted sepia, there's some new music but everything else is the same. The animations are the same, the mechanics are the same, and there's still the menu bug where placing your cursor between two menu buttons would highlight both items which makes clicking do odd things. There's no Steam Workshop (as of 4/12/16, first day of release), so once you've played all the nations you've just about seen everything there is to see.\n\nIn closing, there's really nothing to recommend here. It shares all the same good points and bad points as the original, but bundled into an extra $15 package that just doesn't feel worth it. In response to fears that the game is just overpriced DLC, the creator went on forums and told people that the game had enough content to stand on its own. I'm afraid not.","April 12","false","1.9"," 224 of 300 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","224","300","5","23"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062930115/recommended/427470/","76561198062930115","DG Dobrev","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198062930115/","403 products in account","TL; DR version of the review:\nIf you don't own Democracy 3, buy Democracy 3 Africa. If you own Democracy 3, buy D3A now or on a sale if you feel confident with D3 and want more challenge. If you own D3 and dislike the idea of a country swap with some added policies and difficulty, or think that can be achieved by mods, stay away from D3A, or buy it on sale.\n\nDemocracy 3 Africa makes the vanilla Democracy 3 look like a tutorial to this one. In D3, you were put in charge of countries that are economically stable, have way less problems and are generally easy to manage. In D3A, you are thrown into a land of inequality, tension, turmoil, uncompetitive economy, and numerous problems ranging from aids to crime. As such, it is substantially harder than the vanilla D3 and requires way more planning and strategic thinking, instead of simple clicking, to which you eventually gotten used to in D3 because some policies worked better than the others.\n\nIn true fashion of my reviews, I will take a look at the good and the bad.\n\nThe GOOD:\n\n1. More challenges for you to overcome - from trying to fix the public health and economy to watching your back every step of the way, the gameplay is fun and engaging.\n2. Every country in the roster plays differently - they all have their problems and you need to solve them carefully, while trying to survive and get re-elected.\n3. A number of new policies for you to implement, tinker with, and use to your advantage.\n4. Strategic thinking wins the game more than ever - diving in a new game is a challenge in itself. It is extremely important to analyze the situation that you have been given and react accordingly.\n5. Strategic planning is crucial - after you have analyzed the situation, you really need to plan a number of turns ahead and be aware of the consequences of your actions.\n6. Multiple ways to victory - from trying the benevolent way to banning weapons and arming your army and police forces with submachine guns to keep the peasants in line, every country in the roster provides a number of ways to survive long enough for you to retire victoriously.\n7. More assassinations coming your way - yeah, that's a good thing in my opinion. It forces you pay to more attention to the lower part of the "gun" table, which is something I felt few people do in D3. When the first warning comes, you always have a chance to react because of your stability. No more - here you may have a really ineffective law enforcement situation, that you may kick the bucket on the next turn.\n8. You get to pick your difficulty - just like in D3, the game does not constrict you in any way. Play the way you want - even a few % difference on a slider can make for a completely unique experience.\n9. Last but not least, and very important - unlike vanilla D3, I never felt like doing the very same thing to achieve success. Playthroughs are way more diverse and way more fun.\n\nAnd now, a look at the BAD:\n\n1. Huge difficulty spike in comparison to Democracy 3, to the point where it may be off-putting to some. You will feel like doing the correct thing, just to get assassinated on the next turn.\n2. Assassinations happen way too often - which can also be a bad thing. Unlike D3, you have no time to react, unless you were aware of the situation and did so in advance - as assassinations oftentimes happen on the next turn after the warning.\n3. Realism - I have often asked myself just how realistic this game is, and during the past 3 hours of gameplay, I am more incluned to say that it is more unrealistic than not. Some playthroughs felt right, other not at all - for example, with Kenya (which I consider the toughest of them all) I fixed the uncompetitive economy, stopped the crime, achieved gender equality, stabilized the economy, all that while dodging tons of assassinations, just to lose at the elctions. Is that realistic, or "That's XCOM, baby!!!"?! I will let you decide for yourselves.\n4. More of a reskin or DLC than a new release  - D3A adds few innovations and policies, along with some new music and pictures, and brands itself a completely new release, when it feels more like a D3 reskin with other countries and increased difficulty.\n5. Price tag - it is the valid concern of the community. Being a reskin with added difficulty and new countries, I myself can't help but wonder if that whole thing could have just been modded into the vanilla D3 through the workshop, and I am more inclined to say that, yes, it could...\n\nCONCLUSION:\nI recommend this game based on the fact that it constantly challenges me and helps me develop a better awareness of the situation that I am put in. If D3 felt like a very elaborate puzzle, then D3A elevated it to new heights and added additional challenge. As such, I feel right at home. I liked the original D3, and I like this one as well. I expect to dump easily over 15 hours in it, and I am looking forward to it.\n\nHowever, what's a good game for me may not be a good game for you. The downsides of D3A are the lack of substantial innovation and prety much not enough new content to merit it's asking price. This is why, if you are unsure whether to buy or not, I would suggest to grab the vanilla D3 on sale (if you don't own it already), tinker around with it for a bit, get a feel what you can expect from the game, and then buy D3A when it goes 33% or more off.","April 13","true","4.5"," 127 of 172 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","127","172","7","0"

But I honestly cannot recommend D3:A at this point.\nTo start with, the game is a blatant money grab. There is in no way enough new material to justify making D3A a separate game, and not an expansion. I like the developer enough to let it slide, but if you don’t, I don’t blame you.\n\nMy main critique is that the game is horribly, horribly imbalanced. Assassinations were always a mess, but this time they grew to the point of being borderline unmanageable. In some countries you start with so many problems you get several groups gunning for you from the get go. Game becomes pure RNG at this point – you’ll either placate everyone one by one, or you’ll get killed. You might think upgrading your security might help, but I tried cranking everything up to maximum (curfews, drones, torture, you name it), and no luck.\n\nIf by some stroke of luck you manage to survive and get re-elected, the game becomes your usual D3 lategame – basically you lead a utopia shaped by your design. Some lategame hits later, but it’s a cakewalk compared to what you had to deal with earlier. Honestly, at this point Positech should get their sh*t together and learn how to balance their game.\nHilarious, this COULD get fixed by mods, but- ugh. Mod support is done from the D3 workshop, so you have to own the previous title to get them. The expansions are also listed in D3, so I assume you have to own the original to buy them. I have no clue how this f*cked up system is supposed to work, but it doesn’t anyway. If it did, you’d still have to pay for the original game  - If they had a shroud of decency they would make Democracy 3 free.\n\nSo as much as I’d like to recommend D3A, I honestly can’t. It’s an imbalanced, overpriced mess, that’s only good for one or two full playthroughs, and a few “Eliminated crime, got assassinated next turn. 10/10” giggles.","April 16","false","1.4"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

I would still recommend this game to someone who wanted a better answer than a, "Yes!" but I would definitely preface my answer with an inquiry of what kind of game you'd be comfortable with playing. Although that perhaps sounds slightly sinister the truth is that Democracy 3: Africa is a very niche kind of game.\n\nA Short Description\n\nDemocracy 3: Africa is a stand-alone "expansion" to the political simulation game, Democracy 3.\nIt therefore does not need the original to run, but can run the original's mods and expansions (as long as the original is installed on your computer).\nLike the original, this game is about managing a country through the careful usage of policies. You'll receive a finite amount of 'Political Capital' each turn that must be spent on; introducing new policies, cancelling old policies, and altering the severity of other policies.\nThe screenshots on the Store Page show the game as it is - there are no other graphics or models than is shown.\nThings I've noticed that deviate from the original\n\nYou are much more likely to be assassinated, especially by Feminists. This is because as a whole, Women start out in a much more deplorable state than the original, which causes much faster radicalization than the original Democracy 3, this is exacerbated by Intelligence Services that start with very little funding.\nYou will start out with very low (often 0%) Approval Ratings due to the fact that you'll start with numerous red 'Disaster' Events (eg, Armed Robbery, HIV/AIDS, Technology Backwater, etc). This will persist for most of your first Executive Term until -if you're good enough- you'll have ended most of them and your Approval Ratings will jump to above 80%, These jumps in Approval Ratings are much more abrupt than the original.\nThere are now ways to change how long your Executive Term Limit is, as well as the length of each Executive Term. This means that if you want to you can become a Dictator thanks to the ability to also alter the level of Democracy in your country - although this requires a lot of Political Capital!\nWhat I Like\n\nIt's a compelling game. You can try different approaches to each game you play. You can very easily 'roleplay' as a different ideology.\nEasy to grasp, with the option of resetting the Tutorial - which is always nice.\nAn options menu that us functional. Although it appears limited, all the options you'll need are here, from separate Sound-Sliders to alternate Resolutions (and a Full-screen toggle!).\nA lot more policies than the original!\nYou can set the names of your political party and its opposition, as well as set term limits prior to each game (including options such as 'Monarchy', etc).\nIt's obvious that the Devs of Democracy: 3 Africa have put a lot of though into this game in order to differentiate it from the original and making it feel a lot more 'special' as well as more accurately depicting a lot of the idiosyncrasies of African politics, economy, and social life. I suggest checking out this Community Guide for more details.\nInterface is a lot more colourful than the original.\nOn the Steam Forums, most of the "Haha, Africa doesn't have Democracy!" morons have been moved by the Dev into a special sub-category - which I find hilarious.\nWhat I Dislike\n\nIt can be hard to find a specific policy on the main screen. Unless you familiarize yourself with the position, or visual appearance of a policy it can easily be 'lost'.\nIf you check a policy you can see its effects, which are green for increases, and red for decreases. I'm probably an idiot but I do sometimes get confused when I check a red "Disaster" Event and check its influences (For example, 'Obesity' has a green bar called 'Food Price' that is increasing it, but my brain says that green is good even though if something increases 'Obesity' levels is not good).\nThe Assassination ending is still a personal issue. Although I understand why it exists (a failure state) I still think it is a slightly ham-fisted means to decentivize rapid angering of a voter group. Although, it should be noted that I cannot think of an effective alternative to it.\nEach game starts you with a randomized Cabinet - many of whom have Sympathies to groups that you are bound to anger, which will decrease the amount of Political Capital you get. I almost wish you could pre-select a Cabinet to prevent this, but, such a change would circumvent a design choice that encourages players to not anger every group in the first few turns.\nNotes\n\nIt's relatively cheap. Saying "It should be DLC!" is kind of redundant considering its priced like a DLC (In my opinion) and is much cheaper than the original Democracy 3.\nDon't expect an infallible political simulation that is 100% accurate - perfection is an impossible standard.\nThe ideologies and voter groups (Liberal, Conservative, etc) in this game are the "pure" forms only really found in textbooks, the political reality is different to the game's reality. Which is a very necessary design choice - so alter your expectations accordingly.\nMy Political-Science Lecturer (from a few semesters ago) is a big fan of the original Democracy 3, and much like me, is overjoyed at having a Democracy 3 game that includes our country South Africa. It means a lot to have a well thought out game set in Africa.\nEdits\n\nA few typos and weird spaces fixed.\nAdded more notes.\nAdded 'Things I've noticed that deviate from the original" category.\nAdded a few words.\nThis was reviewed on Version 1.0 (Release Version)","April 13","true","24.5"," 42 of 65 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","42","65","3","0"

This game is about politics, so obviously if you are not a fan of politics, you will not appreciate this game. Also, the game has a lot of depth to it which makes it highly complicated to understand all the intricacies that come with it, The tutorial is pretty bare bones and therefore leaves the player to figure out the game through a lot of trial and error. While I personally a fan of this style of game, I think this may turn a lot of people off.\n\nFinally, and what annoys me the most are the amount of bugs prevelent in the game. Often the graphic overlay disables, making it impossible to navigate the main screen. Also, apparently the only terrorist organization present in this game are the feminists as across over a dozen playthroughs, I have been assassinated only by them, even on a few "test" playthroughs where the only focus is promoting gender equality. The last bug I've had is that about once an hour the game freezes, sometimes requiring a game or computer restart to fix. Because of these bugs, I am unable to recommend this game until they are fixed","April 13","false","15.8"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","2"

I have never played any game from the Democracy series\n2. I am a grad student studying African politics\n3. I will continue to update this review as I play\n\nWhile I very much appreciate that a game has attempted to include African political dynamics, this game falls short in many facets. My primary criticism is the game's nearly exclusive focus on vertical as opposed to horizontal politics. I recognize that this game includes different segments of society depending on their occupation, ideology, rural vs urban, and other factors. What is lacking is ethnic fragmentation. To be more precise, most countries in Africa are far more ethnically complex than a simple "minorities" group can encapsulate and ethnicity or ethnolinguistic identity is generally the most salient political feature.\n\nMy second criticism is the lack inter-elite and intra-government competition. The political capital mechanism is a useful method of simplifying these dynamics but doesn't take into account other actors who seek to undermine the political and economic goals of the state. For instance, political actors may support insurgencies and secessionists such as MEND and Boko Haram.\n\nMore to come...","April 30","false","7.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

The errors I would claim are that this is very focused internally aside from a few controls to set general International policy such as trade. I would have like to have seen the ability to create my own trade agreements with nations of my choosing and why not incorporate international war and let people choose how active the coutry will be in that.\n\nI think the playablility is lacking slightly and it seems like this game favours balanced politics as whenever you try to do something extreme for the fun of it you will most likely be assassinated.\n\nOverall?

However, it does feel a LOT more like DLC, or an expansion pack - rather than a brand new game.\n\nWhereas Democracy 3 was far too insistent on creating a social paradise for winning conditions, D3:Africa will punish you greatly for upsetting the social/economic balance of a Country too quickly.\n\nD3:A moves far away from "just push all the sliders up to max", and more towards an art of balancing your priorities as necessary. One slider too far in one direction makes all the difference between you winding up in a casket, or living to serve another term.\n\nIt's the same ocean of content that you've come to expect from D2/D3, but the ocean feel a lot deeper now.

I absolutely find it to be extremely rewarding and fun. Having no prior experience with Democracy 3, to all those who are wondering if this is a good place to start, yes, it sure is. There is various ways to influence the social structure of your nation.\n\nGameplay: Take a look at the screenshots, what do you see? Bubbles, arrows, icons, stats? Yes, this game is heavy on icons and stats. Update: Everything you see in the screenshots is more than that, you can literally implement new policies that will then show up on the screen once you implement them, and there is a lot of policies to fiddle around with. Simulating all that data in the form of sliders telling the game engine what you want, and what you don't want. In Democracy 3 Africa, you are essentially giving a some data about that countries particular problems. You are going to be making some changes around these parts, and that ultra status quo (which is everyone) won't like it. In Democracy 3 Africa GDP is everything, did you ever hear the expression, "Money makes the world go-round." Well, it's true, if you got a crippling debt, your interest rates are going to ruin your country. You are given two primary ways to fix your country. You can either do it democractically, or you can be a totaliarian-warlord, like um, Adolf, and basically put a gun to someone's head until they do what you want.  They have their ups and downs, but whatever floats your boat right?\n\nReplayability: I've own played through two nations, Mauritius, and Kenya. In both playthroughs, I was assassinated, and I didn't even get through one term. There is so much to experiement with. You are going to die, and you are going to die a lot. However, there is plenty of options before starting the nation like turning assinations off, and whether the votes are compulsory or how liberal or socialist the country is at the start. Personally, I find it fun, slowly correcting my mistakes and experienting with new policies, the flexibility to modify your start and try out new policies is what makes me come back for more. There is a lot of different scenarios presented with each nation. Mods for democracy 3 will not work for Democracy 3 Africa, so new mods would have to be created with the D3A engine.\n\nFinal verdict: Democracy 3 Africa strikes me fairly well. I've spent almost half the day prior to picking this game up reading reviews and all sorts of bizzare steam forum posts (I'm talking about all you radicals in the forums.) Still, one claim that will still remain true, alt-tabbing seems to have some problems so keep the game in maximized border screen mode if you wish to be alt-tabbing.  I have done my best to cover as much as the game as possible, if I missed anything, leave it in the comments.","April 13","true","7.8"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","3","12","0","0"

Navigating a developing nation from conservative and religious to more democratic and liberal presents intriguing new elements. I think this edition offers enough new content to justify its price (which is still $10 less than the original D3).\n\nAll in all, this is a worthy progression of the franchise and will likely be enjoyed by previous fans of Democracy.","April 12","true","8.9"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","4","15","2","0"

It's really that simple.\n\nOn face value, Democracy 3: Africa appears to be a more challenging clone of its Western cousin due to similar game mechanics, events, voter groups, and policies. In truth, though, this game is far more complex than its predecessor and does an excellent job capturing the unique struggles of a developing democracy, as opposed to an established, affluent Western power. There are several new events - both good and bad - to define each starting country, women inequality is a significant factor, and corruption is rife. Will you stablize a fragile economy and bring prosperity for your people, or will you depend on foreign aid to survive? Will you establish a free and equal society striving for the common good? Or will you consolidate your power and become a "benevolent" dictator appointed by God Himself? These options are available to you in D3:A. And it's freaking awesome.\n\nThe one thing people will probably complain about is the price tag. I personally am fine with it, since there is far more content than the standard DLC pack. It's also worth noting that if you already own the DLC for Democracy 3, they will also work with D3:A.","April 12","true","12.8"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","30","6","20","0","0"

I'm running Win7 64bit if that makes any difference to folks.\n\nUPDATE: It seems that many of the issues folks are having are due to two problems. One is that D3:A doesn't play well with the Avast antivirus program. The other is that if you have mods installed via Democracy 3, you must uninstall those mods in D3, NOT JUST unsubscribe them. The executable for D3:A is apparently getting confused by the D3 mods and causing a crash each time you try to start a new game.\n\nThe game is like the original D3, but with some significant changes for the change of venue. I suggest that folks who want to find out more about the changes go to the Game Guides section of Democracy 3: Africa and you'll see posted a guide that lays out in detail what is different.\n\nI've now played several games of D3:A and it's definitely harder than D3. You will get assassinated pretty quickly unless you can keep folks happy. You may, of course, always disable the chance of assassination in the options menu.\n\nOverall D3:A, like D3, is a game of balancing demands from different factions while also trying to keep the economy in check and not be assassinated.  There's a good Let's Play that's available to show you how the game is played.","April 12","true","2.8"," 7 of 26 people (27%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","27","7","26","2","0"

I hope the developer resolves this bug soon.

I would like to rewrite it. Before I complained that I felt that the game was the same exact thing as the original Democracy 3. After I couldn't get a refund I decided to suck it up, and sit down and play the game a little bit more. I did pay for it, afterall. After putting a few more hours into it I actually found myself enjoying the game through roleplay and deep immersion. The game is enjoyable if you give a little bit of time. There are a few problems that I do have with the game. I wish that a few more policies would be implemented or maybe a few more mechanics in future patches, I just feel like the game is missing something but I don't know what. Secondly I still think that the price should be reduced a little bit. I feel like $15 is a bit too much for this game.","April 17","true","13.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
