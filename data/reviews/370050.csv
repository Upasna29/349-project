Simple rules, yet it is possible to make challenging levels.\n++ Having an editor (plus online level exchange) is great.\n+ Nice simple clear graphics.\n+ Nice Egyptian theme.\n+ No performance issues here.\n+ Linux!\n\n- There were some challenging levels, but IMHO it could have done with a few more hard ones.\n- Some levels (even on later areas) were so simple that all you had to do was touch each scarab right at the start, and wait. Some of these even awarded "innovative victories".\n-- The achievements are a huge grind, and there's way too many. This has resulted in many people submitting trivial level packs that are just there to help you get the achievements.\n-- A few bugs (including significant ones about scarab misbehavior) (reported here).\n\nIMHO, 6/10.","November 17, 2015","true","86.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

You need some quite developed spatial thinking and planning abilities to get those little bug(gers) to go where you want them, though sometimes just klicking randomly will lead to a victory too.\n\nThe one thing that did not quite sit well with me was that you never know how many more clicks you get before your horus statues - the equivalent of stars here - start vanishing. So basically, if you suddenly figure out how the hell the level you're playing is to be beat, you pretty much have to start it new, so you won't lose your little birdies.","November 27, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"
