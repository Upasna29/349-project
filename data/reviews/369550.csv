"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/369550/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBlacksea Odyssey is somewhat hard to describe in common terms. The best way to describe it would be as a twin stick shooter at its core, with permadeath, loot and epic boss fights. Levels are procedurally generated,fully destructible and come with dozens of different creatures to fight against. The tutorial also explains the controls both for keyboard and mouse and controller at the same time so you can choose whichever you prefer.\n\n\nThe core:\nThe main premisse of the game is pretty simple. Once in every decade, four contestants compete in a hunting tournament to find out who is the greatest hunstman and you play as one of these contestants. This tournament is divided in 5 rounds. Between rounds you’ll be placed on the Blacksea map, here there is some text dialogue between the contestants, they brag about previous deeds and mock each other. It is on the Blacksea map that you can visit the shop to sell your unwanted items or buy new ones and it is also here that you can choose different bounties to take.\n\nEach bounty has its own description, such as difficulty level and stats such as “-% enemy damage” or “-% credits dropped”, aswell as the amount of credits you’ll earn upon completion. They are also divided into different biomes such as Tropical (green) and Crystal (blue). Each biome will reflect the enemies you’ll encounter once you’re there.\n\nThe boss and overall creature design is pretty damn good. The game does a really good job in showing you which body parts are weak spots and what kind of attacks that enemy has. Not only that, but no two creatures look the same.\n\nDuring bounties you can choose either to farm credits by killing lesser creatures or you can go right away for the boss. After killing the boss you’ll complete the bounty and then you’ll be awarded score points based on your performance. It is these points that will rank you in comparison with the other contestants.\n\nWhile playing you’ll also find chests that contain loot and that can be opened with keys, keys which you’ll find by killing enemies. In Blacksea Odyssey, loot is presented in the form of runes and potions that improve both your ship and your weapon. That said, this is where progression comes into place. Right now there is only one playable character, The Old Man, but more are on the way and I assume that each will fit a specific playstyle and each  will have its ups and downs. You’ll also be able to choose one of various spears to choose from. each with its own passive bonus and specific stats.\n\nCombat\nThis is main part of the game so let me do my best to explain how it works. Besides attacking with your spear, you can also throw your harpoon into the creatures and use it to rip body parts off or to slow down said creature. However you can’t just spam both your spear and harpoon because some enemies have armoured body parts. This forces you to keep moving and flanking your enemies so you can deliver a fatal blow to their weak spots.\n\nIt is also worth mentioning that your ship has a booster built into it. This booster is divided into three different types, short boost, medium boost or long boost. Using the short one will use up one boost bar, the medium will use two bars and the long one will use three bars. This is very helpfull to escape from tight situations and to open passage on terrain, thus proving to be a life saver at times.\n\nSo, if you haven’t guessed already, the combat is very fast paced and you’ll find yourself using your boost to dodge and using your harpoon  at the right moment to slow down your foes and deal tons of damage.\n\nOne thing that bothered me at first was the fact that the camera is very close to your ship, but you also have a sonar to guide you, which will show you where creatures are on your minimap, as well as rock formations.\n\n\nVerdict:Astonishingly good music\nFast paced combat\nStylish visuals\nBlacksea Odyssey is as solid as a rock can be. It has tons of potential and I trust the developers to improve the game, since they update every 7 days if I’m not mistaken. The only thing that it needs right now is more unlockable characters and weapons (perhaps ships as well?). The combat is refined and extremely enjoyable and everytime you defeat a boss you feel like you’ve accomplished something great.\n\nI highly recommend Blacksea Odyssey to people who enjoy hectic and fast paced fights with enough enemy variety to force you to adapt to new situations.","March 6","true","2.1"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","5"

I can imagine some people might not like it, but I personally loving it - it fits the game very well.\nThe second, more important, thing is "rip off" mechanic.\nThe idea is that all monsters you hunt have vulnerable parts. And if you want to defeat them quicker - you can weaken those parts and then use your harpoon to rip them off dealing massive damage.\nIt's not easy to pull this off, especially on more protected monsters, but it feels pretty awesome being able to pull this move off :D\nYou can of course just keep shooting and kill monsters the traditional way, although it takes quite some time this way.\n\nThere are couple of issues and minor annoyances in the game at the moment.\nChests are not shown on the minimap so it's a bit tricky and somewhat annoying to search for them.\nMinor UI glitches, spears missing targets (my guess is hitboxes need tweaking) and other small things.\nNothing game breaking was noticed. And devs are promising updates every 7 days.\n\nSo, if you like rogue-lite twin-stick shooters and theme with new mechanic does sounds good - go for it.\nThe game's pretty cheap and very enjoyable for what it is.\n\nWatch more in-depth look in my video:\nhttps://youtu.be/z4DbwAX1NPU","March 2","true","1.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","0"

As a fan of roguelikes and dungeon crawlers I was interested in this game from its creation. I enjoy the customizability of your character, as far as upgrades go, as well as choosing your weapon at the start of a session.\n\nThe random element of what runes you get, or what bounties are available, adds onto the difficulty factor, but not in a bad way. I would compare it to the randomness of item rooms and floors in the Binding of Isaac. If you are good enough at the game you can definitely complete the rounds without any runes in the way that an amazing Binding of Isaac player could defeat Isaac with just base stats and base items.\n\nLooking forward to what's next for Blacksea Odyssey!","March 4","true","4.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

However the moment you are dropped into your first match (hopefully after learning the few ropes you need to know) you embark into a randomly generated stretch of space and go out to hunt your target and see where this game really shines:\n\nEvery enemy of the game has weakspots you can tear and rip, most of which are giving it either an attack to hurt you with or which are essential for moving around. As you begin your first hunt you get to feel the first satisfactory rip and tear of an enemy's body while learing to maneuver the board you are "surfing" on. Once you have fished away all the "smaller" enemies (or if you feel lucky go straight ahead to kill the boss) you end up meeting the prey you chose only to face a creature that might as well hunt you down instead. The bosses with their elaborate behavior patterns, massive size and tons of HP are the bread and butter of this game and it is a blast to "hunt" them down. They whack you away like the fly you are forcing you to learn their patterns, evade projectiles and melee attacks while whittling away at often elusive and protected weakspots to tear them off to do more damage. This essence of studying your target and strategical approach makes for tons of fun with hours on end! Even if you bested the same boss over and over again you come back and the "worst" you could say is "Oh, hello old friend. Is it this time of the tournament again?"\n\nAs for controls the game is smooth and swift, the harpooning and spear-throwing going on without issues while requiring your skill to make the most of them. You HAVE items you can use, but one-use items are to aid in a pinch and are never able to one-hit anyone but lesser cannonfodder. They are all about strategic use which you have to time, less the item is wasted or even worse...you! Several spears (not harpoons!) to choose from give you another tactical element to consider which often goes hand-in-hand with the "runes" you find. They are passive bonuses which are divided into the "Spear" and "Ship" group which augment and enhance the respective aspect in many ways. Do you want some poison damage to slowly chip away at the bosses health since you cannot hit him? Do you want higher chances to throw more spears for bursts of Extra-DPS or are you so cocky to use a rune massively boosting your damage while you stand still? The options can be mixed and matched on the spot thanks to a generous inventory size so you can adjust to match every enemy with a tactc befitting him and while there are pattens it is you who sets the pace and approach every time.\n\nTo summarize, Blacksea Odyssey is a game about real "big-game" huntin in space with options to improve your weapon and ship while challenging you to take on more and more dangerous creatures with 4 different Contestants (3 Unlockable) to choose from and over a dozen harpoons. The closest equivalent would be a Monster Hunter meets Top Down Shooter in Space, although the customization here is not as massive. Taking bosses apart in a literal manner is fun and requires skill which keeps you coming even for bosses you already ended before to see how much better you have become. Fighting them is adrenaline inducing as you are likely fighting for 5 minutes per boss depending how well you do and things never get dull either. I have yet to notice a bug that affected gameplay and it runs smooth without issue and I clearly recommend this for anyone liking themselves some top-down action against big bosses round for round and a handful of RPG-inspired enhancements. Each run is new and yet not, old "friends" and new challenges surfacing every new try. Now get out there Contestant and hunt your way to the top in the depths of the Blacksea Odyssey.","June 2","true","3.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Can get about 3/4ths in, and then it becomes an insane hell of dodging shots and incoming enermies, many of whom are bulletproof except in certain weak points.

Just because I can't beat a game doesn't mean I don't enjoy my playtime greatly; I'm just not a hardcore, difficult games winning person.  Still a damned fun play.\nThe upgrades are useful, the powerups are balanced, and the art style has been described, by me, as like 'They made an image of a monster out of lasers, and then it became solid and came to life.'  There is a borderline sadistic glee in hunting down the massive bosses, dealing out the damage as you dodge and weave, and then RIPPING off a fin or clawm and seeing a hunk of their HP vanish, and often suffer a loss of speed or mobility or a special attack related to that bit.

Puff Daddy was far too difficult at first, but after I got used to him, it became a lot easier. Moonsplitter is absolutely incredible and my favorite design-wise. I don't know why, I just love him. Megalarch and Belch Brothers are great, and NOM NOM NOM?!?!?!?!?!? How do you come up with stuff that creative? Great Ghuza did not disappoint, Wyv the Elder's unique Tri-Breath was great, and Charybdis (I hope I spelled that right) was UTTERLY INCREDIBLE. I mean, the whirpool mouth insta-kill, the crazy under the screen tentacles, the vast number of little sucker-like poison shooters... I mean, I can't find anything to dislike. Here are my only problems. 1. Wyv the Elder has such a fast breath recharge that it's nearly impossible to rip out his tails. Also, his attack range is a bit too wide. 2. Belch Brothers are waaaaaaaaay to easy. 3. Can you even rip off ANYTHING from Puff Daddy? Enemies are all great, except for one stupid little bugger that makes my blood boil... THE SKITTISH LEAP-FROG. The idiotic little monstrosity looks great on the outside, but of the inside he's a green little ball of PURE EVIL. I'd take three belch brothers with my ship at ten hit points over five Skittish Leap-Frogs. Also, I continue to encounter a bug where my harpoon passes straight through enemies. Doesn't happen nearly as often with bosses. Getting stuck on tiny bits of stone or spinning rocks is a problem too, as well as me constantly getting blocked by weird, unbreakable invisible walls that harpoons and spears can pass through as well as enemies.

Instead of indiscriminate firing, you can repeatedly spear a particular body part (such as an eye that shoots poison darts) and eventually harpoon it and rip it out. As a result, no more poison darts while you finish it off.\n\nGameplay video, including four bosses:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flzjrYgLGn0\n\nEach round of the game (out of 5), you choose a bounty to go after. You'll always have a choice of 2-4 randomly chosen bosses, each offering different difficulty and potential rewards.\n\nThen you launch into space. You start by exploring, looking for regions where you can encounter groups of smaller enemies, which will earn you small bounty, and if you're lucky, power-ups. If you're very lucky, a dead fish will drop a key that opens a chest that may contain runes - more on that later. And if you kill all enemies in a region, that results in bonus bounty at the level's end (as does speedrunning the level).\n\nOnce you've done everything you want to, you can go and find the boss, which will be lurking under the surface (of, er, space). Fight the boss, earn a huge bounty explosion, and move onto the next round.\n\nBut man, the bosses! They're brilliantly designed with a great art style and each demanding different fight strategies. Some are more traditional bullet-sponges, others level-swallowing mouths with vast tentacles. Others are armoured pyramids with a death-star exhaust port to fire into. And the biggest boss, the leviathan, can fill half the level and has teeth for DAYS.\n\nEach boss (like all enemies, in fact) is designed to scale to different sizes. At "elite" scale, the leviathan's mouth ALONE is several screens long. These encounters can be genuinely breathtaking.\n\nIt helps that your old man controls so well, once you get used to the "surf-like" turning. Once you master it, it allows you to dodge all manner of bullet hells. A controller is ideal for this movement, but I ended up on keys and mouse because I found aiming easier (and the game struggled to interpret some of the gamepad buttons reliably for me).\n\nRoguelike elements mean each level is created afresh, although none of the layouts are particularly memorable, they're just arenas for the fighting and make you have to explore a bit.\n\nWhat is more memorable is the rune system - this is a great game for people who love to repeatedly play to hope to come across the rarest runes. They power up your ship and spear, but come in different rarities - some of the most powerful rare ones are nuts, but you'll hardly ever get to use them. You can also fiddle with the rune loadout to pick the ones that suit your play style. Shame nothing carries over from game to game (at time of writing, at least).\n\nOnly real niggles - the spear collision on some of the smaller enemies can be a bit off. You can use either mouse & keyboard or controller, but each have their weakness. Some of the easier bosses can be a chore once you've fought them a lot. You can have bad runs where you simply never find any power-ups.\n\nIn summary, I love this. There's still loads of new content to come over early access, but it's great already. Highly recommended.\n\nBuild played: v0.4.4.\n\n* More gaming videos by Randomise User","March 2","true","13.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

A nice vareity of enemies, a solid feeling gameplay, and I feel a lot of effort being put into this game.\n\nPros:\nA base game to build off of.\nFrequent updates\nA somewhat unique idea\n\nCons:\nCurrently doesn't feel balanced\nREALLY RNG HEAVY\nYou're basically FORCED to use the unique mechanic (Harpoon)\n\nMore detail:\nThe gameplay feels really great, has a nice flow to it.  But whenever there's a heavily damaged part, you have to harpoon it, not allowing you to do any damage to the creature (at least to that part)  I argue that kind of kills the flow of the fight, especially for weaker enemies that are typically smaller.  My suggestion is to make some sort of text indicator while allowing for damage to that part to be felt.\n\nAnother complaint more than a few bosses are just giant big dummies with large damage immunity zones that rush you, and in certain areas you get stuck in them that leaves you constantly getting damaged due to you colliding with them, so you die in a couple of seconds.  Personally it makes me feel less like a solid object maybe make the collisions cause both of them to move around from eachother or cause immunity to damge untill the both of you stop colliding?  An example is Mooncrusher.  Giant, and only rushes at you.  While some may feel it fair, I feel it's kind of lazy, hopefully some of it isn't to stay.  Another thing is recycling basic enemies as larger bosses.  Well anyways even though all of that is a problem, the game as much as I hate saying it, is a promising game I only wish to update this again when it releases, I am hoping that it's as good a improvement as I forsee.  The main thing I think needs work though is balance, I read another review saying it was too easy now while that wasnt my experience maybe there's a need for a difficulty option with a wide vareity of options, like oldschool ID software big.\nhttp://the-artifice.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/doom3.jpg (Reference)\nOr maybe larger that doesn't quite look as long as I remember...\n\n------------------------------------------------------\nVideo Review (Abriged/Lessformal)\n------------------------------------------------------\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYuiboRQvgs\n\n\n------------------\nOriginal review\n---------------------------\nIn it's current early access state I dont feel like I can recommend this game.  After a long session of play I felt really bored.  It's not horrible, not even that bad.  It's just that I cant see much good but I want to say why I dont like this game.\n\n1. A couple subjective things here.  Personally I like some of the graphics others I dont, like the textures on the objects, but I feel like the random level parts are just there and dont add anything, just a bunch of leaves or something not particularly ugly, I just find them un attractive.  And the soundtrack is really not my thing, some of the themes left me with a headache, which is how I discovered that there's either no music option or it's glitched at the moment not allowing me to mute just the music so I muted the game in windows audio.\n\n2. The gameplay.  It feel way too slow because you from the start do low damage, and everyone else does low damage, yet has high health so both you and the enemy are just hitting eachother but it feels like you're going no where.  So I guess the current balance of the game causes pacing issues for me.  The health in addition to the enemies having tons of immune areas, and the bosses mostly being tankier larger versions of regular enemies made a lot of the fights feel boring.  Also the AI feels copy/pasted across all the enemies.  They slightly float around while turning and then randomly dash rather being like most shoot em ups where they have a good constant speed in predictable patterns in some way that still attacks you.  Overall gameplays a bore which made me have to not reccomend the game.\n\n3. WHY ARE THERE SO MANY CHESTS THAT ARE LOCKED ESPECIALLY AT THE START SERIOUSLY I JUST WANT TO OPEN SOME LOOT BEFORE I TAKE ON A BOSS FOR FREAK SAKE GIMME A CHANCE GAME!","March 12","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

I am not usually a fan of top down shooters but the artstyle and the colors really caught my eye. The game focuses around a huge competition in which you try and kill the biggest sea creatures you can in order to gain fame on the blacksea. The game forces you to play the tutorial (for good reasoning) and I finished thinking, "This won't be too hard." I was definitely wrong about that. Some of the non-boss monsters can sometimes be just as big as the boss in each round and often times just as strong. You have to be quick and ready to make split second decisions as each enemy will use different tactics to try and defeat you and are even smart enough to try and corner you if they need to. My first attempt at taking down the boss NomNomNom led to a valiant defeat between us both only having one HP left but him having the last hit left me having to try again. The game shows no mercy outside of the tutorial and I truly appreciated that about this fast paced little game.\n\nI did a let's play of Round one against NomNomNom as the Old Man if anyone is curious:\nhttps://youtu.be/pgcF9Pi2pSQ","March 10","true","1.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

You’ll find yourself roaming the space sector hunting for your bounty, there might be a few aggressive minos but nothing compares to the big catch. You are armed with a rune infused spear to pierce your enemies and a harpoon to detach limbs, being quick and accurate is a must as you evade persistent strikes and try to land your harpoon into the colossal creatures…ehmm..tentacle?…fin?…eye?\nYou start off with the only character available which is the Old Man, I’m assuming you’ll be able to unlock other characters later in the game. You get to see the Old Mans stats and learn about his back story. After you read about his epic beard and bionic arm you go to the weapon select screen which has a variety of weapons to choose from but you only get to select the Crude Spear as the other weapons you need to unlock. Now your on the map where you can choose different sectors to hunt your prize bounty! Colossal creatures have epic names like Nom Nom Nom and Magalarch, they also come with a range of difficulty and different stats for enemies in the sector such as all enemies on the map will have reduced damage or you can also have reduced item drops. There is an item shop that sells equipment to recover hit points for your ship and increase your damage, but just remember once you die you lose everything! Overall I love the whole concept of this game from the epic boss battle music that gets you pumped to the Old Man surfing on his space ship.

The majority of the game-play revolves around hunting down and killing giant bounties, with each bounty requiring a unique approach. Each enemy in the game, even the small trash mobs that you will have to fight through to get to the big bosses, have components that you can destroy that will weaken their overall fighting capabilities. For example, if fighting a boss that shoots lasers out of it's eye, you can actually focus fire the eye and eventually removing the boss's ability to shoot lasers out of that eye.\n\nBSO also features a Diablo-esque drop system, where the each enemy killed can drop items, including executables that have cool on-cast effects and equipables that give passive boosts. This drop system was actually one of the highlights of the game for me. Once the player accumulates a selection of equipable runes, the game-play starts to become very fun. You go from slowly chipping away at an enemy's defences to destroying entire sections of bosses in only a couple attacks.\n\nMy biggest complaint about the game in it's current state is that the early game can be rather off-putting. You kill slow and move slow until you find some rune drops. However, once you find a couple runes, thats when the real game starts. You kill trash mobs super quick, and actually start to feel like the legendary space hunter that you supposedly are.\n\nIn review...\nPros\nFun rune system\nMusic was great\nEach boss requires a different approach and strategy\nDestroyable environments and monster dismemberment\nSome bosses are huge! Ran into one bounty that took up most of the playable arenaCons\nOnly one playable character (more on the way)\nThe early game is slow until you can start equipping runes\nWeapon slection is sparse until more options are added\nCharacter development revolves entirely around the drops you find\nOverall, it is difficult to write a proper review for the game, as it is currently missing many components that the developers plan on adding, ranging from entire play modes, to additional playable characters and levels. In it's current iteration, however, BSO is a game that should be watched, as it definitely has great potential.","March 8","true","2.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

Aiming with any sense of consistency is impossible. These issues apply to both keyboard&mouse and controller. The enemies never move how you would expect. Many of the small neemies will have boost-like movement, but even while boosting in a direction they will slide left or right which makes trying to avoid them frustrating.\n\nThe bosses are big, which they use as a selling point, but the camera doesn't zoom out, or follow your ship well enough to make the fight feel like you are fighting a huge monster instead it feels like you are alwways stuck on the undamagable side of a big wall. If you are close enough to see where to aim at a boss, you are far too close to be able to avoid attacks. Like, FAR TOO CLOSE. I found myself sitting so far away I couldn't see any part of the boss until I thought they were done their sttacks before going in to try to get a few hits in.\n\nI have no idea if once you are supposed to start weak and get better with unlocks, but your starting weapon's effectiveness is on par with in what, in any other game what would be disgustingly useless. The smallest of enemies takes maybe 3 hits to kill, but due to the first probelsm stated this means probably firing anywhere between 5 and 10 shots.\n\nThe harpoon is a cool idea for tearing away pieces of the enemies, which is the best part of the game, but the charge time and the enemy movement again make using it not worth the effort other than on bosses.\n\nIf I may be so bold as to recommend ways to fix most of the issues: Take away the turning your ship has to do to move, let it just move immediatly in the direction you want to move in. Fix enemy movement so that it is more predictable. When you fight a boss have the camera zoom out so that you can see the whole boss as well as the environment around it. Increase the width and damage of your attacks so that they can be as least some what effective.","June 5","false","0.9"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","25","1","4","0","0"

I don't understand it, there are so many games that look like a great time, but the developers seem to say "You know what, I don't want this game to be very good" and throw in perma-death, because that's what everyone definately wants, to start over and over again.  You know why Dark Souls isn't a flop? Because it's not a ♥♥♥♥ing rogue-like.  You know why Doom isn't a flop?  Because it's not a ♥♥♥♥ing rogue-like.  So why make your game a rogue-like?  Developers, take your ♥♥♥♥ing fedora off of your double chinned fat ♥♥♥♥ing faces and stop making everything that resembles a good game a ♥♥♥♥ing rogue-like, noone ♥♥♥♥ing wants them.

It's a rogue-lite top-down shoot-em-up set in space and you're on a rocket powered surfboard as you fly through the black sea (re: space) throwing spears at space-fish and using your harpoon to violently rip body parts off of these space-fish.\n\nIt sounds like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t but nothing I said is false or exaggerated.  It's all genuine gameplay and it feels awesome.  It feels great to rip the leg off of a giant space-frog and then finish perforating it with your infinite supply of javelins.  The items all add significant choice of how you alter your gameplay, and the consumables are all fairly interesting.  It's a fun roguelite with a creative setting and a unique aesthetic.\n\nThe description claims RPG, but I wish it were removed because the only remotely RPG-like feature is the inventory.\n\nA few complaints:\n- the terrain kinda sucks and is frustrating to move around and is pretty dull in general\n- it's annoying/tedious to find things in the world because the sonar (radar) is small and local and doesn't show chests\n- some elements of the UI don't quite match aesthetically, so there's a weird disconnect (minor complaint at best)\n- the screenshots on this Steam page shows a lot of items but items seem much more rare than the screenshots suggest, leaving you starving for something to equip half the time\n- chests are very underwhelming for how tedious/annoying they are to hunt down\n\nThese complaints are all acceptable to me considering how fun the game already is and the fact that this game is in early access makes me hopeful that the devs will address these complaints over time.  And they've promised updates EVERY 7 DAYS.  That's awesome!\n\nHere's a video of my first impresions of the game:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxHgPKkP37w","March 15","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game does NOT have "Full controller support"!\nGamepad thumbsticks have no deadzone\nNot every Menu is controllable with the gamepad (e.g. shop window, level finish screen), or is simply behaving weirdly (level selection map)\nhavn't seen that the gamepad is reconfigureable and I'm not happy with the thumbstick button boost\nwhen I try to fly into the opposite direction as the char is currently watching, the char flies a small half circle. This is especially annoying when standing still and trying to avoid a bullet, in which case the char does fly into the bundle most of the time.

Beautiful concept, beautifully implemented.\n\nYou are bounty hunter, one of a few that can be unlocked. You're in a competition against other three bounty hunters. You pick a boss that's got some bounty on it's head, prefferably the higher ones since you're in a competition. That boss is too huge to be killed by simple arrows, which is why you have to rip those bosses apart with a harpoon. You have 9 rounds, each unlocking you harder bosses, while you upgrade yourself with drops you find from chests, bosses, or from a shop you can access each round.\n\nThis is a difficult roguelike bullet hell piece of art, with some unlockable characters, many unlockable weapons, each with unique style of attack, lots of big monsters and HUGE bosses.\nIt's really fun.
