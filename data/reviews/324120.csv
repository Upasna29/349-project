I hate to say it but in its current state, it's not worth the price tag.\n\nThat being said, what I did experience, I really enjoyed. I just think it's really lackluster given the premise and the atmosphere. Everything was very linear, the inability to backtrack at times was extremely frustrating. I expected a lot more than I received.\n\nI know it's Alpha and I really hope it grows and evolves because it has SO much potential. Every other reviewer seems to think its the best thing since sliced bread and I just don't believe that yet.\n\nI'll be watching it closely to see just how it does shape up and I fully expect to rewrite this review in the future.

I was about to recommend this game, but I was waiting for something more to be in a game before I do this. Well, it didn't work out.\n\nWhat's good\n\nFirst, it's very impressive to see such game to be developed by one man. I had a lot of fun providing feedback and bug reports on the forum while the game was in Early Access.\n\nSecond, the idea of the game is good. Attempt to present it looks a bit dramatic. There are some good moments in the game which can create an illusion of something interesting happening.\n\nWhat's bad\n\nThe idea of the game is undeveloped and presented very shallow. It looks like a very short and linear story told us via game. If you compare a game devlopment to a movie development this game reminds me of a short clips directors make to present their vision to producers before they are hired to film a full movie.\n\nThere is absolutely no challenge in this game. You just move further because you have nothing else to do.\n\nThe game interactions that affect your story progression boil out to just  moving around and using terminals. All other interactive objects are secondary and give very little benefit.\n\nThe overall design of the game is very unobvious. The game lacks explanations and player assistance. You can discover some pieces of information scattered around only if you'll be ignoring story progression and specifically looking for them. These pieces of information are very disconnected from each other and won't give you a full picture or even a hint about it. Maybe if you collect them all you'll be able to see something. It seems I haven't found them all.\n\nThe game still contains bugs.\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NAS7nwjsjcw\n\nSummary\n\nI was expecting this game to be in development for at least a year more. I was excited about what this game could be.\nI never expected it to end like this.\n\nI can only recommed it only if you're interested in studying game design. There are very good examples of bad design decisions, and a few good ideas. I would like to read post-mortem for this game.","December 19, 2014","false","8.8"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","41","54","0","0"

Moon and Silent Running did, too.\n\nImagine those kids met and fell in love playing Digital: A Love Story. That grandkid would be Verde Station.\n\n\n\nBased on that lineage, I thought I was going in with pretty clear notions of what to expect, one of them being the paradoxical expectation of the unexpected. In spite of that, I was genuinely surprised by twists and turns in the narrative within 15 minutes.\n\nI was not expecting to see an ending in under two hours. Those seeking a game to play moreso than a space to explore or a narrative to unravel will probably get there sooner, and probably be disappointed-  there are other Steam reviews that claim to have finished in 20 minutes. But Verde Station seems clearly designed for multiple playthroughs. Exposition via recursion. Nothing here is as it seems, including the fade to black. The narrative IS the game.\n\n\nAt this juncture, all I can definitively say is those two hours have left me itching to go back, and as a fan of these experiential setting-sims, that's worth my recommendation.\n\nIf you are the type to embrace "walking simulators" because the term "game" is more of a pigeonhole, keep this one on your radar.","December 19, 2014","true","1.9"," 28 of 33 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","28","33","2","6"

It's like an internship only the pay is much better. You can read all the books you want. Catch up on some music and movies. Bask in the solitude. You can go at your own pace, just remember to check the plants. You really need to maintain the integrity of the plants because if they are alive, you are alive. Don't get too worried about the little things but definitely make sure to log any issues you encounter on the station. Also a good tip is to really really stay focused on your mainframe. I mean the terminal. It's a terminal. I mean the system, it's a server with terminals. I named a mistake when I logged the books but keep reading because you'll need all the books in the microwave. Mug plenty of air when yoU plants the kitchen. Also, any an I mEan ANYYY horse that is brown or galloping SHOULD be boring. Appreciate their screen bat make sure to cleanse the view view.

Verde Station gives the player an incomplete set of building blocks from maybe more than one story and asks them to put it all together however they see fit. If you treat the game how it's looking to be treated, you should come out with some things to think about. If you want the game to entertain you passively, this might not be the game for you.\n\nSome people are saying they did everything in the game in under half an hour.

Why do you do this to me?! Why do you make a game that's so good to experience but so hard to talk about without completely spoiling?! I feel like I'm in some kind of weird verbal bondage where I can't really say what I want and have forgotten the safe word. Oh well, I'm still going to try treading on eggshells here and talking about this and we'll just see what happens. Here goes...\n\nI originally saw this on sale and had the words "walking simulator" and "adventure" and "sci-fi" jump out at me, all things which I'm a fan of, so I figured at 99c I probably couldn't complain either way no matter how it turned out. I didn't read any further on it beyond the general positive score, and, boy, am I glad that's as much digging as I did. This really is a game that benefits from some blissful ignorance before going into it, save for maybe the fact that it's pretty much completely devoid of conflict of any kind and is instead based mostly on "purpose". At least in as much as you have a role to play and a function to fulfil and that will pretty much be the extent of the gameplay.\n\nYou awake on the titular station and are immediately given a test on your mental state and told to perform it again every 30 days. You are then given the task of maintaining the station's plant and tree life for future endeavours and to also check them every 30 days. What follows is the strange juxtaposition of tasks of tedium among a spectacular setting... basically a janitor in space. There's more to it than that, as you'll explore the handful of rooms that make up the station and read various log entries, but all that is best left to your own discovery.\n\nI know it sounds like a total non-event, but I promise you there's more to it than that.\n\nIt kind of reminded me of the classic '60s TV show The Prisoner. It was weird and never really explained itself and by the end you probably had more questions about everything than answers, but still thoroughly enjoyed your time with it the whole way. That was definitely my experience with it.\n\nThe only complaint I'd probably have is I was left wanting more. Sniffing around every inch of the station to try finding new things to see or possibly interact with took up the lion's share of my hour or two with this title, and I do wish it could have been eked out to something longer and the concept expanded upon. But otherwise, the brief time I spent is something that still managed to have great impact and will stay with me for a while, and I strongly recommend you take the time with it, too.\n\nOh, I just remembered... the safe word is Verde Station.","October 5, 2015","true","2.7"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","4"

Verde Station follows in the footsteps of Gone Home and The Stanley Parable; it's a game about exploring an environment, and in so doing, coming to understand that environment. Or, to try anyway.\n\nLike Gone Home or The Stanley Parable, it's easy to "win" Verde Station. You can go from the opening to the ending in half an hour if you put your mind to it. But that's not the point; don't do that. Take your time and, more to the point, think about what's going on. Expect to be confused. Expect to be misled. Expect to be surprised.\n\nIf you say the phrase "walking simulator" with contempt, you probably won't enjoy Verde Station. That's fine. But if you're willing to leap into the unknown (and Verde Station is one of the very few pieces of media that actually is improved by approaching it without knowing what's going to happen), I cannot recommend this game more highly.","December 20, 2014","true","4.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

That's, just to say, not a bad thing, because it provided a nice surprise regarding the experience and it felt kind of nice.\n\nOn the other hand, the experience itself was not so terrific in the end. That's probably because you know exactly what's\ngoing on when you take a close look at your surroundings. (I'm not going to mention any details.)\nTake a second/minute to take in the details and you might be able to figure out what's going on yourself.\n\nAnother thing I didn't really like, but that's probably because it's still in development, is the short gameplay of each playthrough. Depending on your play speed it can be done in less than, let's say, 40 minutes.\n\nWhat's good? Fear, by answering a set of questions you're supposed, or you believe, you get a custom tailored portion\nof fear presented to you. If that's completely correct, I don't know, because I don't know how the game has been designed. But, it's done in a good way and makes you act careful for as long as it lasts.\n\nI recomend the game as far as it concerns the concept, but I don't recommend it based on actual content. It's too little at this moment. The experience doesn't last long enough at this time to be regarded as a full gaming experience. It feels more like a test setup for psychologic gameplay elemenst to see what works and what doesn't. (Depending on your goal as a developer)\n\nConclusion:\nVerde Station has potential, but needs more work. It needs longer playthrough time. At the time of writing the presented content is not enough to keep you satisfied for long. For the current price you expect more material, story and interaction with your surroundings.\nBut, I do recommend Verde Station, because at its core it's a great concept that does work in a fast way. And if the developers do something with the feeback, they'll be able to create an awesome game in the end.","September 29, 2014","true","0.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

I recommend it especially for those of us who love exploration and atmosphere above all else. It reminds me of older adventure games in its ability to truly draw you into the environment and make you feel like you're there.\n\nI spent 2.5 hours playing, soaking in the atmosphere, poking in every nook and cranny, and enjoying every minute of it. This isn't a game to be rushed through. Take it slow and get in a thoughtful frame of mind. Play it alone, with headphones, and "bask in the silence".\n\nThe atmosphere is absolutely my favorite part of Verde Station. There were times when I genuinely felt isolated- and a bit frightened- wandering around the station. Though the game is a "walking simulator" it does a great job of ramping up the tension at certain points.\n\nAs for story, there's a lot not directly said in this game, but if you take your time and pay attention, it becomes clear. I disagree with the reviewers who say that the game has no story (or that the story doesn't make sense). It's there, and by the time you reach the ending, the truth of the situation can be inferred.\n\nThe only thing that could have improved this game for me would've been multiple endings.

Controls are simple and effective, sounds and environment set the mood perfectly.  Unlike some other exporation games *co-DearEsther-ugh* there's plenty to interact with, keeping you involved and entertained.   I played the game for a little over half an hour before deciding to come write a review.  It was a fun session and left me wanting to play more (which I will definitely do later tonight, I think playing the game while it's dark out would help immersion).\n\nIMO, the game is worth the current price point it's selling for ($8-10).   I am curious to see what the final version will be like.\n\nOnly thing that's bothered me was the universe outside the windows I could see the seams of the graphic box of the universe.  Suggestion to devs would be make it a sphere so it doesn't take away from immersion. Also, when I walked on books, they didn't fall or get knocked out of the way, but if I drop a ball on them, they fall all over the place.\n\nUpdate (from comments on this review and finishing the game)\nFYI, game is a tad on the short side. Most people should finish within an hour to an hour and a half if they're taking it slow like me. Good to replay one or two more times to try different things, but most would probably consider this a one-shot game.  So at most you'll probably get 2 hours out of this game before you're done with it.  I still would say that's not bad considering I spend more on a meal at Taco Bell.\n\nUpdate Update:\nDeveloper is answering a lot of questions in the Community Discussion section.   He just mentioned this:  "I do plan to add to the game length by including more items to interact with so players are spending more time in each area. Especially in the Lounge and Kitchen. They are a bit sparse right now."","September 27, 2014","true","1.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","9"

It can't quite be classified as horror, but the game has a wonderful way of building up the atmosphere as you inhabit this lonely vessel in space, making you feel that impending sense of nameless dread. This is definitely not an action game, either. It reminded me of the Stanley Parable in some ways, minus the narrative but with plenty of the existential crisis-inducing moments. You explore and feel out the story for yourself. You could easily make it through to the "end" without having discovered any of the details of the backstory, and still enjoy the overall experience. But the real fun is in taking your time, truly getting into the role you are playing as you examine your surroundings for clues as to what exactly happened here, and what is happening to you now. My only real complaint is that there isn't more...I would love to see this game with multiple endings, for instance. The game holds so much potential, it would be great to see it expanded upon even more.

The game simmers like a fine sci-fi short story, a disquieting experience that leaves many issues unresolved and rewards a couple of replays.\nIt's been compared, aptly I'd say, to the movie Moon; another obvious parent would be video game Consortium for its spaceship setting, its puzzling structure and focus on minute exploration.\nThis is the rare game that manages to present itself in such a mysterious guise that even the achievement guide on the community hub takes the form of hints and questions rather than straight-up instructions.\n\nIn fact there is so much dramatic flair on offer here that it begs the question of what could be achieved with greater means. If I had a regret regarding Verde Station it's that there isn't more of it - I don't mean hours of useless to-and-froing or shooting sequences, but hidden narrative depths to tangibly explore, not just muse about. The game feels like it's brimming with fascinating secrets but I guess there is only so much actual scope you can reach for as a single dev.\n\nKudos for evoking so much. I strongly hope down the line these fascinating intuitions and conceits will mature and yield an even more coherent whole, and this promising short story will blossom into a full-blown novel.","June 25, 2015","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't hold your hand and lets you explore the space naturally and uncover the story that makes it feel so rewarding. Especially with the console commands, it makes you feel like you are really driving the story forward and little things like this go a long way. The atmosphere it creates is unbeleivably creepy and lonely and I can only imagine how it would feel with oculus plugged in.\n\nI really enjoyed it and for the 1 dollar I paid for during the sale, amazing.

Over the year your mental state declines and by the end of it you're unsure if you can take it any more.\n\nSPOILERS AHEAD ---------\n\nBut here's where it failed horribly for me:\n\n1. All these disk logs about stuff that happened on the station. None of it made sense, or seemed to have any purpose.\n2. Why are you maintaining this tiny station with only 1 bedroom? Who are you maintaining it for?!\n3. Why was the station itself engulfed in a video simulation cube?\n\nAt the end of the game, if you restart you now have access to a code that opens up the huge docking bay doors, meaning you can see OUTSIDE of said cube. You can see the planet you're orbiting, you can see the beauty of space, you can even just about see - if you squint - the space ship that will eventually come and get you in the far distance.\n\nThis makes the reply 100% stupid, because you no longer have that suspense of 'why is the outside of the ship glitching, is this real, am I mad' etc etc.\n\nWith a lot of polishing this could genuinely be a great game.

It felt like it's going to require doing a lot of chores to maintain the space station, but I was glad to discover that this isn't what the game is about. It has an actual story, and it picks up from there. I was also surprised by the ending which is always a plus.\n\nCompared to other "walking simulators", I enjoyed Verde Station more than Gone Home. It simply offers a lot more interactivity and a better story. It wasn't as amusing as The Stanley Parable, and wasn't as atmospheric as Dear Esther, but all in all I would rank it between these two in terms of overall enjoyment.\n\nSome people complain that Verde Station is short, but for $1 (on sale) there's more than enough content.

You are in charge of maintaining the greenhouse (for some reason).  And that's about it.\n\nI couldn't shake the feeling during this game that it was 3 a.m. and I had had another sleepless night and was watching "Silent Running" on the SCI-FI network.  Except Bruce Dern rocked and those robots he had were kind of cool.\n\nI almost didn't give this game a second chance but I decided before I could give it a rating I needed to try it again.\n\nI did.  It still doesn't make any sense.  It's a mix of "Silent Running", "2001:  A Space Odyssey", and just about every other space-station scenario you can think of.  The concept is interesting but played out and this game, unfortunately, doesn't add much to the genre.\n\nOkay, so you're in a space station and what happens?  Let me guess, the protagonist starts losing his sanity?  The computer, which the protagonist depends on, begins malfunctioning?  Slowly the space station gives in to the second law of thermodynamics and everything starts to fall apart slowly?  Didn't need to play it, already knew.  It's every cliche you could think of besides the white hats and the black hats.\n\nExcept there are the disks that give you a neat little story about the white hats and the black hats.\n\nA neat added wrinkle is that concept that the entire space station is part of a huge bureautric corportaion that, in its idiocy, has mindless, pointless bits of red tape that you get mired in.  Never seen that before!\n\nOh, wait...except in "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy".\n\nThe developer touts this as a game ultimately about paying attention.  It's a kind of open sandbox, walk around, figure-stuff-out-yourself adventure.  I liked the sound of that.  At first.  You walk around a space station, only five or so rooms, and you can interact with stuff.\n\nBut pretty soon you're just walking around a space station with only five or so rooms with stuff you can interact with.   It's pretty cool because you can pick stuff up and.......put it down.\n\nAnd pick a book up and....put it down.\n\nAnd pick a plastic container up and.....put it down.\n\nOh and then you can....flush the toilet.\n\nWow, who thought being along in a space station could be so incredibly boring?\n\nI'm sure there is a story here somewhere.  I just didn't really care much about it.  I get that the game tries, at times, to disorient the player purposefully because it adds to the psychological drama.  And I get the concept of having a game that you have to discover and figure out.\n\nAt some point, though, this type of game needs SOME kind of structure.  You have to have some reliable way of at least keeping time -- it's a space station for Christ's sake, they can't build in a f*cking calendar and clock?  Otherwise the game just becomes a mish-mosh of stream-of-consciousness experience that doesn't make any sense.  What you want is a game that doesn't make any sense but still makes a little sense while you are playing it.\n\nI don't think there would be that much to tweak in the game.  It would be nice to have some puzzles or something.  Something to do besides open and close valves.  Something besides listening to really bad music used only because its copyright has expired and the developers didn't want to put out a ton of cash.  Give me something to do, please.\n\nSometimes doors open, sometimes they don't.  Can't figure out why.  Can't figure out what is actually happening and what is misperceived.  Can't tell if the what appears to be a bug is actually purposefully programmed into the game.\n\nAnd, in the end, don't particularly care.  Might have a high replay value, I guess.  Next time I want to feel that life is pointless that it's nothing but a bunch of unrelated episodes with no underlying purpose....well, next time I feel this like I'll read "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead".\n\nThe ending of the, I think, was the best -- who would have predicted that it was all a fake journey?  Oh, wait...just like in "Capricorn One".\n\nOnly thing I can figure that was left out of this game -- Klingons.","February 6","false","1.7"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's an adventure game. I would call it a cousin to the walking simulators... you're exploring an environment devoid of other people using a first-person perspective. But there are definite puzzles to solve and a definite ending to achieve.\n\nMore than that, I don't really want to say. It's not a long game, and as the developer warns, you can only experience it the first time once. It's definitely meant to be experienced. If you're interested in a sci-fi adventure game, grab this one.\n\nBe aware that it's a bit buggy; if you don't hear footsteps when you walk, you should restart the game.\n\nMy full review is at http://indiegames.com/2014/12/review_verde_station_is_spoile.html.","December 30, 2014","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes I enjoyed the game, I fully recommend it and I will definitely play it again, buuuut; it is not worth 10 euros or dollars (or other currency). It should really be half that price, for which I am glad that I bought it on sale which is what I recommend everyone else does.\n\nNow my personal notes: I really liked what the developers have done here and it was really fresh how they made my isolation so scary and freightening.  I do wish there where some more explaination, but if there were then maybe we wouldn't theorize ourselves so much? It has several small details that if you miss you would lose on the experience but since the enviroment is small and sometimes poor those details stand out. I do hope that the team behind Verde Station continue in the same spirit on another game but with more content and clearer storyline. Oh, and I also really liked how they made the moniters and menu interface work the same, it created more nice atmosphere. Now, go and play it!","December 31, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very hard to talk about without spoiling it. Similar to games like The Stanley Parable, Gone Home, The Old City: Leviathan and Jazzpunk. Strongly recommended to anyone who has enjoyed those games and has even a whiff of an interest in playing this, though it is quite short. One of those games that dabbles in story telling methods that only a video game can provide.","December 18, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And tbh thats what it felt like, i dont want to give anything away by saying what happened as a played, but the best way to describe this for me...it was bit like being in a kubrick film, somewhere between The Shining (psychological aspect not the horror) and 2001 Space Odyssey.","February 1, 2015","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you like Sci-Fi and exploration, you'll probably have a great time.  I completely agree with the various comments I saw suggesting that people just play it without reading about what exactly the game even is.  That is good advice, and I'm very happy that I took it.  A fantastic story.  Well worth what I paid for it.\n\nI do think that the 3D graphics could be handled a bit better though.  I have a high end system, yet it seemed to be struggling to render the environments fairly often.  I almost feel like the rame runs without using the GPU at all.","February 1, 2015","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/recommended/324120/","shiaakuma","shiaakuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shiaakuma/","696 products in account","This is a really enjoyable game if you like Stanley Parable-esque "walking simulators" and games that mess with your head from start to finish.\n\nI would highly recommend not reading too much about it first, as any kind of information about the later parts of the game especially will really skew and possibly ruin the experience.\n\nThis takes a couple hours total to get all achievements; your playtime will vary based on how much you explore and experience.  You could probably blow through it in half an hour but you will miss the majority of the pieces of the puzzle of what's going on.  As it is, the game leaves a lot for you to think about and connect the dots on yourself.  If you don't want to think much or want the whole story 100% explained in black-and-white by the end, you're not going to be happy.\n\nI will mention, without spoilers, that several of the achievements require you to enter DOS-style .cmd commands into a terminal.  The terminal that's required is the MAIN MENU terminal before you even launch the game itself.  This has been confusing to a lot of people so I wanted to throw that out there for anyone who is, like me, obsessed with achievements.\n\nGive it a shot if you like these exploration/story-driven games.  It is 100% worth the $4.99 asking price for the immersive experience and story.","July 12, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
