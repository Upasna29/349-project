Most LEGO games I have had the pleasure of playing have contained many a belly-laugh moment and it's because of this humor that I have fostered a soft spot for these kinds of games even as over the years the formula may have become more refined but remained steadfastly the same. LEGO Batman: The Videogame is no different and plays out like every other LEGO game in the TT LEGO cannon.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479058568\nLEGO Batman: The Videogame is also one of the last few games from the franchise where non of the actual characters in the storyline speak any recognizable language. Over the years this has changed to include full voice overs but there is a certain charm to hearing each LEGO digital figurine espouse dialog through a series of grunts, groans and squeaks that I find oddly enduring and far more funnier and entertaining than the voiced counterparts of the recent LEGO entries. LEGO Batman: The Videogame is also one of the few LEGO games that follows its own storyline not simply relying on the narrative of the famous films it mimicks to prop it up. While the game may not use the films as its inspiration it thankfully does include Danny Elfman's famous and wonderful Batman score that should evoke a nostalgia trip all on its own.\n\nWhile the story may not be the biggest selling point here - its a simple story about how every villain known to Batman has absconded from Arkham Aslyum and it's the task of the worlds most famous detective and his super sidekick Robin to ensure that they all find their way back into the prison holding cells from which they escaped. The game world is broken up into three acts which each contain five episodes. Each one of those episodes usually ends in some sort of boss fight with one of Gotham's famous villains and most are colorful, creative and fun to engage with. The boss fights are not particularly hard but do require some thought when dealing with and most cannot simply be taken down my mashing the attack button often requiring the gamer to use the environment to his/her advantage which usually mean smashing everything in site around the enemy to see if there isn't some LEGO blocks hiding about that can be then used to build a device of some sort to aid you in your troubles.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=477997973\nAs is with most LEGO games each level you encounter will be flush with areas and puzzles you won't be able to complete the first time around until you have unlocked the necessary character and completing the games story mode will only often see you through about 30% of the game. If you are a completionist you will need to return to these areas through an option called free-play that will allow you to switch characters in an out (once again - provided you have unlocked them), each with their own unique abilities to help solve the puzzles you couldn't solve the first time round. This feature does add a nice level of longevity to the games and its often a lot of fun trying to figure out which of the characters in your arsenal is the right man or woman for the job. If you decide to play solo then you are given the option to switch in and out with both Robin or Batman during the games story mode or any other unlocked character during free-play. During co-op its pretty much the same situation except you obviously can't inhabit the same character your current co-op partner is controlling.\n\nLEOG Batman: The Videogame still comes with a few caveats though. Even after so many iterations there is still no online play to be found anywhere and this is a major oversight on TT games part. While couch co-op is great I would love to be able to enjoy a LEGO game with one of my many "eSTEAMed" friends. Also when it comes to platforming LEGO Batman: The Videogame is still very much on shaky ground. The platforming sections have improved greatly with the more recent titles but LEGO Batman: The Videogame, being one of the older LEGO games, still suffers from some terrible platforming mechanics which can sometimes be borderline frustrating.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=479018976\nLEGO Batman: The Videogame is a fantastic and fun LEGO game and is the perfect game to share with yourself and your kids. Its a formula that still works to this day (hence the deluge of LEGO games on the market at the moment and the many more to come) and it's simple and quick enough to pick up and enjoy in small bursts or longer playtime sessions. If you are a fan of the DC character then it's a definite recommend purchase for your library and if not simply grab it for the kids and then let the game win you over as you co-op it with them.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","July 18, 2015","true","9.9"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","92","68","74","9","9"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/recommended/21000/","ejbspeed","Pywackett-Barchetta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ejbspeed/","340 products in account","When I first played this a few years ago, I didn't know too much about Batman. I didn't have to. This game serves as an excellent introduction to both the licensed LEGO titles by Traveler's Tales and the various interpretations of the Batman mythos from DC Comics, and if you're a fan of either, I'd be rather stunned if you didn't enjoy this.\n\nIt's your standard Batman plot. This one is not ripped from any existing film or comic, but is instead a new situation made to send you through as much of LEGO Gotham as it can, as both the Dynamic Duo of Batman and Robin shutting down the evil plans of Arkham Asylum's escaped supervillain denizens, and those iconic villains themselves going out to cause trouble. It's a very bright and colorful Gotham, though still quite dark. I guess it'd be more accurate to say it's a high contrast Gotham, and this leads to a rather gorgeous visual design heavily influenced by the Tim Burton films, a place that's beautiful when it's not being creepy as all heck.\n\nIt's much more the campy, silly kind of Batman than the darker Dark Knight of late (Arkham Asylum totally nailed that shortly after), though like I said, a few places are still certainly creepy. There are some changes for gameplay's sake, such as all of the villains being shipped off to Arkham Asylum (instead of some going to Blackgate Penitentiary, as Arkham is a hub level). Instead of constantly changing characters, the Hero missions have our heroes constantly changing Suits found within the level. Some are really cool, like the Glide Suit allowing you to soar or the Attract Suit allowing you to vacuum things (it's oddly entertaining), while others are just kind of a hassle or quickly forgotten about, like the Heat Protection Suit (good luck remembering it's a thing) or the Magnet Suit (have fun walking up walls very, very slowly every other level). You're able to switch between these as though they were separate characters in Free Play, and the villains don't have such gimmicks, so it kinda evens out in the end. You're able to unlock suit upgrades, and many of them, like speeding up the intolerably slow Magnet Suit to tolerable speeds, feel like they should've been available from the start.\n\nThe levels are very distinct, and for the most part, I would say very fun. This was, however, just before they started handling vehicles properly again in the LEGO games, so there are some completely infuriating moments where you have to tether your vehicle to mines and slam those mines into things, but they don't and they just slide around wildly until enemies blow them up and you have to start all over. When this is not the case, they are entertaining and explosive action sequences, but dang are they a pain to 100%. (Admittedly, I still boot up the game exclusively to play the Batmobile level, because you get to drive the Batmobile and just tear through the streets of Gotham.)\n\nSo, fans of the LEGO games, this was the game that set the par for the course, bringing in targeting mechanics, 32 levels, and a long list of increasingly obscure characters (Batman fans probably won't believe "Joker (Tropical)" made it into a "kid's game"). Fans of the Batman series, you'll find that much as the game takes liberties for the sake of humor or gameplay, they did really do their research first before intentionally making these choices. And you can play as Bane, Alfred, Batgirl, Nightwing, Hush, and one extra at 100% you're bound to geek out a bit over. Bios for each of the villains appear in the levels where the heroes fight them, so if you're new to the series and know very little about it, you'll come out quite well-learned.\n\nAll in all, it's fun. Campy, creepy, and stuffed to the gills with little nostalgic nods, atmospheric combat, and iconic characters. For once, it's exactly what it says on the tin. LEGO. Batman. There you have it. If that sounds good, go for it.","October 25, 2014","true","29.8"," 49 of 52 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","49","52","2","0"

So simply put, if you like the other Lego games, you'll like this. Being one of the older titles, the cut scenes don't feature any dialogue and personally i think this suits the Lego games much better than the likes of Lord of the Rings, Marvel Super Heroes and The Hobbit which DO feature dialogue. It doesn't suit the game. This means Lego Batman is up there with the Lego Star Wars games as being the best of the Lego series and the ones i recommend the most.","April 24, 2014","true","16.8"," 27 of 28 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","27","28","0","0"

The reasons I picked this up are because of The Lego Movie and a Batman fans. After I played this, my assumptions are never correct.\n\nOk, this game is amazing. It has good level design, great game mechanics, characters ability, and decent of puzzle solving. There's one thing I'm not satisfied is the A.I. Their inteligence meter is like them bots in Payday : The Heist. Sadly, there's only local co-op. Control wise, I'd recommend a controller. If you're going to enjoy the story and atmosphere as an adult, you're going to have a bad time. (Not much cutscene and voice acting).\n\nHigh replay value, you cannot retrieve all the hidden stuff on your first attempt. There's this free mode which you can control all sets of Batman and Robin suits along with other villians with exclusive abilities. There's a lot of stuff you can unlock as well. Characters, Fun Facts about Batman and vehicles.\n\nPerformance wise, I keep getting 30 fps on my GT650M. Occasionally random 60 fps for few seconds. The PC port is damn good. There is no bug. I never got the crash to desktop or any not responding stuff. There's are glitches though. (Spoiler Alert) :\nThis one may happen if you leave Robin too far away during Story mode.\nOn the Zoo level, do not attemp to jump to a stair while riding an elephant. The animal will block your exit.\nOn the 1st level pursuing Joker, do not return and use the last 25 parts on the first machine.\nSo far I've encountered those 2.\n\n10/10 would recommend.

This first Lego Batman game is a little bit more closed doors that the second  since its more level based instead of being open world. Much like the Star Wars Trilogy by Lego. But its still awesome! Full of content from the Batman movies and universe. This game has all the villans we see in Arkam Asylum and City. The game uses Music by Danny Elfman, so we instantly get the Tim Burton Movie feel of the 90's. Its set up into 3 episodes. The Riddler, Pinguin and Joker. Over the course of all these levels we fight Two Face, Poison Ivy, Bane, Scarecrow etc. First I thought the game was fairly short but then realized that after unlocking Episode 1 you can go over to Arkam and play the game from the villans point of view. Changing the game completely. The set pieces lock beautiful and are very gritty and dark. Sound and Music are just perfect. I recommend this game to kids but also grown ups will have a blast with this game. Specially when you play with a friend or girl.\nIts great that these Lego games have a certain charm girls dig, so if you think your too macho to play this at least do it for some game time with the Girlfriend.\nOverall this game is amazing. Cant wait to play Lego Batman 2 with all the DC characters.\n\n10/10","January 6, 2014","true","32.9"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","35","45","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/21000/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","LEGO Batman is the third game in Traveller's Tales's LEGO videogames series. If we count Star Wars games as a single game, yes. And it was released in 2008. And wasn't based on any movie for first time ever. And it was as multiplatform as it gets, being also released for PS2, PS3, Xbox 360, Wii, NDS and PSP. None interesting difference compared between consoles and PC. PSP is like big brothers versions but beaten up badly. NDS has to be remade from scratch engine-wise and it seems to be worse, smaller and clunkier.\n\nTechnically, there is one nasty major glitch. Just like Lego Indiana Jones game, this game will glitch, bug and hate you, unless V-Sync is turned on in options. So turn V-Sync on, Robin, and one day you will be as cool as Nightwing.\nGame still crashed on me rarely though, weird.\n\nAnd well, what do I say. Holy Batman, it's yet another LEGO platformer game. It the kind of repetetive casual game that is a dreamgame for collect-a-ton players, as you collect many many studs, buy all characters from franchise, collect more stuff, unlock bonus, collect. You can't even die properly, you just lose some studs. Combat is simplistic button-masher, instead it has more focus on casual puzzles. You still can't collect all stuff from Story mode, have to come at Free Play, where you can select another char during gameplay itself. And well Yet Another LEGO Game!\nWell, ok, today it's actually yet another old-style Lego game. Though now with better graphics, yay better lighting and watery-water.\n\nThe big difference this time is that it wasn't based off a movie. That means that it's not going to parody your favourite scenes, which may kill humor for some. All characters still don't talk, only make silly sounds with mouth, but cutscenes are still slapstick.\n\nThe plot this time is simple: Criminals, psychos and clowns on strike had escaped Arkham Asylum along with famous Batman villians and are causing havoc. Batman and Robin must go and beat them up. One by one.\n\nBut hey, at least it brings more of game quality into it. You get to beat bosses at the end of each hero mission.\n\nYep, game is divided into 15 hero missions and 15 villian missions. Which are connected plot-wise, villian chapters can be played after beating hero ones and explain what baddies were doing before Batman and Robin came in and punched them into blocks.\n\nHero missions in story mode always see us controlling Batman and Robin. Nope, it never changes, but they are quite interesting pair. Here they can change to certain suit at special powerup rings, which gives them abilities of suit. Like, gliding for Batman. Or walking on the wall made of metal surface for Robin. They also got ability to throw batargan. You just hold attack button and move cursor over baddies and objects you want to be hit and then release button and watching it fly. Or get busy in meantime. It both lets you get enemies outside of your reach and makes it less repetetive to destroy many things.\n\nDark side missions are more on level of Lego Star Wars. No suit, no batargan. You may get different characters for each chapter, but there is always only two of them. It's still a bit less repetetive than Star Wars, but could use more, like pickable objects from Indiana Jones. It even has those occasional moments where too many enemies respawn too fast and you get killed while trying to solve puzzle and it gets frustrated.\n\nBoth of them have few additional things. Most characters can now pick enemy and throw. It's just for variety, you can't aim where you throw at. Shame. Another thing is that you build up combo number while melee fighting enemies, up to 10. It's actually score multiplier, so as soon as you build it up, go and grab some studs, quick! Melee combat also feels more funny, with some enemies flying out comic-like.\n\nAI teammates is sometimes does more stupid things than usually. Like, he can even sometimes not figure a way to get to you and you will not be tag back easily if you go too far, making you backtrack quite a distance.\nAlso, no one told me that Scarecrow is counted as Riddler when it comes to in-game locked gates.\n\nEh, in the end, it's yet another Lego game. Good for those who love collecting stuff and want to relax with some very casual relaxed platformer. And for people who find Adventures of Batman and Robin for Sega Genesis just a bit too hard.\nOk, that game is hard as hell, so don't be ashamed. I am just ending review on silly tone. This game is still too repetetive to recommend outside of niche market. Even if it's kinda good.","December 2, 2015","true","21.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

You also can/need to change to other outfits that have different powers its nicely done.\n\nBut what I wish the real Batman game had and this game has.\nYou can play as the Bad guys :P\n\nGives another extra 3 episodes with another total of 15 levels.\nIt well done and gives a different view on the good guy missions.\n\nEvery episode also has 1 epic mission in which you get to use an aircraft or boat those are my fav.

Unlike Lego Harry Potter years 1-4 it does not crash up on start up and runs all in all perfect. The Main Story itself is 6 hours long. But if you are really looking into it there is actually alot more that you can do. Once you complete a level you will unlock 'Free Play' which means you can once again go back to the level and do all the things you missed the first time you played it to 100% complete the game.\n\nNow the game doesn't have steam achievements but it does have a ingame gallery where you can see everything that you collected. Although I myself would off liked steam achievements a bit more this game was mainly aimed towards kids which means they got all the time in the world to collect every little piece in the game.\n\nUnlike the newer Lego Games this one has hardly any voice acting in it, meaning the only time you hear a voice is when they make a noise. At first it bothered me when I got the game a couple of years back but now it just add's to that comedy factor they were aiming towards and I love it.\n\nFor the fact that this game came out in 2008 it is a gorgeous game that runs without problems!\n\nI can recommend this game for every Batman Fan and every Lego Fan. However if you are just interested like me in playing the main story I would recommend getting this game on Sale as 20€ is a bit heavy for 6 hours.","June 1","true","6.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I've been a Batman fan since I was a young boy and seeing a huge variety of characters both good and bad, appropriate character bio's, and familiar music got me amped. The intro to the game is a LEGO reshoot of the intro to the Batman Animated Series. It's really cool!

After playing Lego LOTR and the Hobbit, and all the Harry Potters, this game came as a funny and enjoyable disappointment.\n\nThe game doesn't follow any batman films, and each of the 6 episodes has very little story, and I really prefer the speech of the later games to the Lego moans and groans of the older ones. But the real disappointment occurs in the execution.\n\nClimbing up ladders is frustrating, and both of us were often falling off. A few bugs stopped us dead in our tracks too. After 20 minutes of searching around I looked up some guides... oh, another bug. Reset, and go through the whole level again and progress.\n\nThe camera angles are simply some of the worst I have ever seen. The screen never splits into two, and some of the camera pans don't even allow one character to reach his "action" place without the other character being knocked out of the screen. This led to a massive bug.\n\nSometimes when the 2nd player was knocked out of the screen, the game wouldn't let my wife rejoin. This bug happened 3 or 4 times and meant I had to play alone until the end of that level, before resetting the entire game. This has nothing to do with my xbox controllers as the keyboard wouldn't work as well when this happened.\n\nNevertheless, we had a lot of laughs at the quirky buggy nature. Jumping felt so much harder than later games, and some of the puzzles are unfair. My wife would give it a 7 out of 10, but that is over generous. From me, 6/10. Worth a punt when on offer, and you don't have anything better to play.","March 9","true","14.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a lot of fun and of course, the Lego charm is brilliant. However, I found it to be quite samey throughout. And I must admit, that was a bit of a shame.\n\nYes, there was a Batmobile chase with guns and the same kind of thing with the Batwing, but then, it's straight back to running around on the ground punching up scenery to find the items you need to progress. Now, I'm not saying it ruined the experience. Heck no! I wouldn't be playing if it wasn't fun. It's just that the progression seemed a little too formulaic, e.g. need a certain suit to progress, start bashing scenery to find a costume changer. Or the one I mentioned before where, you come to a seemingly dead end, well, time to bash some scenery to see if there's a ladder or something in there.\n\nApart from these moments, it's a nice little Batman game for kids. Maybe I expected too much with the challenges, lol. :P Otherwise, I can see this being a lot of fun with a 2nd player in tow. But in single player, it's decent. Just a shame the camera can really ♥♥♥♥ you over when jumping between ledges!!\n\nSo, overall, a nice little challenging game at times. Also, when I finished, I was at 30% completion... There's a lot to discover and you can go back to find hidden treasures ala Zelda games, etc. It's worth it for the decent amount of time played on the campaign alone.

An example is the opening is the classic batman music from the animated series and the opening is similar to it with two random thugs on a roof top, batman jumps down, leers at them, they draw guns that get knocked out by his batarang before he beats them down and then poses ontop of a building with Robin joining him.\n\nAlmost every single batman villain is in this one. I can understand not including every single damn one, but they did a good job in getting many of them from the famous joker to the infamous Mad Hatter and reletively unknown, Killer Moth. As it's a Lego game all the characters are representing in a comical way and at times the characters act more like the 1960's batman TV show with Adam West, however at other times it's more like the show where in the sewers a Crocodile jumps up, Batman leers at it and then it runs away because Batman, he's the man.\n\nI also enjoyed playing the villain side, doing the stuff before Batman arrives on scene and doing the freeplay missions are quite fun. Most things are obvious to find hidden, but others are so damn well hidden it takes a while. Thank god for guides on the internet.\n\nOverall, I'd say go for it. It's a lot of fun and is one of those perfect games to play to cut off the edge of the day and can get very addictive too. Like all Lego games it's easy and this one has adaptive difficulty too. I can't wait to play the second one as that one is meant to have the DC heroes in it too, though for some reason it's still called LEGO Batman 2, perhaps it takes place in Gotham and is focued on Batman? I'll have to wait and see.","May 25, 2014","true","20.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I wish the game would have a big arrow that tells you what your supposed to click on or at the least lights up so I dont have to go online and look up the answer on youtube. Its so annoying.

There's also an issue whenever you have to control the robots or remote-control cars, they move at around 1-100th of the speed they are supposed to.

I had never beaten it back then so thought now would be a great time to do it. However, the game really hasn’t held up since it’s release in 2008.\n\nThe best thing about the Lego games is the cast of characters that you get to play as in each level that while obviously falling within specific archetypes are at least cool to see in Lego form and to control. Lego Batman has two playable characters in the Story mode - Batman and Robin. Instead of other playable characters they both get different suits which unlock unique abilities such as gliding as Batman or walking up magnetic walls as Robin. You can play as a multitude of characters in the free play mode but I have no idea why they went with the former in the story mode.\n\nThere are fifteen levels, most of which are your standard 3D platformer Lego fare with a handful of vehicle levels thrown in which adds a bit of variety to the standard formula. Each level has their a unique boss fight which more often than not I found to be uninspired with a very basic puzzle required to solve the fight. At least a good portion of Bat’s rogues gallery is here, Scarecrow; Two-Face; The Joker; Killer Moth etc. The levels themselves tend to be a lot of fun even if they all tend to look a little too similar due to the Gotham city backdrop.\n\nI find Lego Batman really difficult to recommend with much better platformers and even better Lego games available. If you are looking for this specific type of game then try Lego Marvel, I have yet to play Lego Batman 2 but I hear that is a big improvement over this.\n","September 9, 2014","false","5.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

That is quite an achievement considering I like both Lego and Batman. The controls are appalling, with no option to use a mouse that I could find and the game failing to recognise a controller. The AI is terrible (which, considering one of the characters will be under AI control at any given point if you play it alone is a problem). The game occasionally crashes and some of the control prompts do not display, making it difficult to know what you can and cannot interact with, and meaning it took a long time until I discovered how I could exit the Bat Cave. A terrible port of a game.","August 22, 2015","false","2.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","1"

Awful level design, repetitive boss fights and a dull fight mechanic break the few interesting features this game brings to the collection. The humour falls flat, the characters are inexpressive and some mechanics, such as having to tow mines with the boat, are extremely frustrating and poorly implemented.\n\nThe levels and boss fights are so poorly design that by level 4, I had already resorted to a guide three times because what you have to do is so unclear - a problem I never faced in the Harry Potter games. Other typical issues also purvey, such as no sense of depth for accurate platforming, slippery edges around pits and one-hit kills – annoying, but not game-breaking. Unfortunately Lego Batman also suffers from ugly shading issues on the characters' faces (making them look very polygonal) and absolutely aweful AI. Make sure your buddy is always on-screen, because if he isn't, chances are he's stuck on something and you'll have to backtrack to get him - there is no catch-up-teleport or switching to the other character when you're that far away. Even some puzzles are made very frustrating because of the AI's broken behavior.\n\nThat being said, there are some very nice features - the Batmobile level was some of the most fun I've had in a Lego game, and for each of the three Batman story arcs you complete, you can go to Arkham Asylum and play from the villain's perspectives (this isn't a bonus, it's the second half of the game). The highlight of the game for me is Danny Elfman's fantastic score from the original Batman movie, which I will never get tired of hearing. Everything else is there: millions of studs, a fair number of characters/vehicles (think the original Lego Star Wars), forced replay to unlock everything and custom characters, if you're in to that.\n\nIf you're hankering for some Batman and don't mind the clunkiness of old Lego games, then this offers exactly what you'd expect. Having now played Lego Batman 2, I can EASILY say the sequel is FAR superior in every way. That said, this stll contains all that lego-y co-op goodness you love from the series and makes for a fine casual game. 5/10 for Gameplay, +1 for Soundtrack","March 28, 2014","false","30.0"," 5 of 17 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","5","17","0","0"

However I am still going to give it a thumbs up as it is fun and has the solid gameplay that I have come to expect from the LEGO series. So why did this not measure up to the other LEGO games in my opinion? Firstly I don't really like super heroes, I can't really relate to them. Also since it is one of the older games there is no dialogue and the plot is fairly formulaic (a bunch of super villains breakout and run amok, batman stops them, the end). But I think the key reason I did not enjoy it so much was it was the first LEGO game I played on my own.

In this game Batman (and that green guy) have to stop the escaped villains including (but not limited to): The Joker, The Penguin, The Riddler, Bane, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Two Face, The Mad Hatter and Mr. Freeze!! Whew! That's hard work just saying it! Anyway, you start of in the batcave go to three chapters: The Riddlers Revenge, Power Crazy Penguin, and The Jokers Return. You (and that green guy again), get to take the Bat-Mobile, Bat-Sub, or Bat-Plane to each of the 3 chapters. The levels are fun and rarely seem repetitive and the boss fights and the end of each level (Yeah, you saw that correctly, one in each level! 15 Bosses!!) are extremely fun. The only annoyance is at some parts, you have to use Batman's Glide Suit, and (espacially at the begining of Man Bats level) there's some hard gliding parkour. Nothing too hard, but it is annoying when you fall and start over. Anyway, after you stop the villains and swing into the screen LIKE A BOSS!! you think it's over right? Wrong!! You get to do the whole storyline over again from the villains point of view!! Those levels are really fun, but they barely have any bosses. In fact, I think the bosses are only in vehicle levels. (Aside from the helicopter in the Stealing the Show chapter) But they are still really fun!! Now let's talk about the music. One word: 1989 They use the original Batman soundtrack!!!

However I am still going to give it a thumbs up as it is fun and has the solid gameplay that I have come to expect from the LEGO series. So why did this not measure up to the other LEGO games in my opinion? Firstly I don't really like super heroes, I can't really relate to them. Also since it is one of the older games there is no dialogue and the plot is fairly formulaic (a bunch of super villains breakout and run amok, batman stops them, the end). But I think the key reason I did not enjoy it so much was it was the first LEGO game I played on my own. So I can't hold that against it, this game is fun and probably would be more fun with a friend.","December 14, 2014","true","27.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For LEGO Batman this isn't different. I never got to play it until now and I must say it was fun and exactly what I wanted it to be which was hours of enjoyable gameplay with an awesome layout. You not only play as Batman but can play as the Villans as well so imagine two separate type of games but combined into one. I say this because it takes separate amounts of time to complete each side of the stories. If your a completionist like I am also well then... it takes more than that.

Power-ups work well and are satisfying, the story mode enjoyable and the puzzles challenging enough. Sadly some of the levels are plagued with awkward glitches, notably with local multiplayer having sections that would repeatedly disconnect a player if they strayed too far from the zone on-screen. As an aside it can be repetitive at times to collect all the items, but this seems standard of most LEGO titles, especially if you're hoping to beat them 100%. The biggest downside is the vehicle portions, which are awkward to control and restrictive in progression. Overall a fun title and numerous hours of enjoyment to be had, but not the strongest entry in the LEGO series.","July 27, 2015","true","40.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is to say, all the characters are based off that TV show, but their personality and the overall theme and tone don't match the TV show which is absolutly fine because if they did I don't think the characters would have translated as well.  There is almost no dialog (there is a small amount of story given during the loading screens when playing as the villians), most of the story is conveyed through actions, a few sounds, etc.\n\nThis game is often on sale and I would recommend getting it only when it's $5.\n\nThe game is charming, play sessions can be short (30 minutes +- a few), it's easy enough for a kid to play but there's enough there to keep an adult entertained.\n\nEven though it has a few short commings, they are understandable and none of them are game breaking mostly mildly annoying.\n\nThe BadSo strait to the point, whats wrong with it.  The graphics are simple (they are just lego pieces) so that asthetic holds actually well, but the cut scenes are pre-rendered and look awful.  Also, there are a few textures that (and by few I mean in all the game I found it in two places) either were bad from the start or didn't age well.\n\nThe controls are not the greatest.  B is your all purpose action button and Y is your all purpose character switch button.  What happens is based on context which should be fine, but handles terribly.  You can't do anything quickly as the game will not register what you mean to do properly.\n\nThe 3D level platforming is frustrating at times.  And the vehicle combat sections are the absolute worst thing.  Like above all, the vehicle sections have to be the single worst thing about this game.  Thankfully, there are not many.\n\nA good portion of the playable characters are re-skinned useless characters (all of the henchmen, police, etc., basically anything that isn't a main character).  And some of the main characters are awful (Catwoman, Poison Ivy, Scarecow, Mr. Freeze, Riddler, Man-Bat, etc.).  [spoilers]Catwoman outside of having double jump has no special functions for any puzzles, and her whip doesn't use the same mechanics as projectiles meaning you have to be spot on, not to close, not to far and aim perfect.  Poison Ivy is better, her poison will arc to destructable objects.  Scarecrows fear dust is a weak stun same as Riddlers mind control cane.  Mr. Freeze would be good except it's effect seems spotty, and you can freeze your teammate.[/spoiler]\n\nThere are times, the game will lag up.  I've noticed this happens only when near a puzzle and computer is calculating if the action your taking influences the puzzle.\n\nLastly, durring combat you can and will attack your second character.  This makes combat more difficult then it needs to be as well as several puzzles.  And when the second character is AI controlled, they don't help much in combat anywho.  The only upside is when they get destroyed (and they will, often) it doesn't count against you.\n\nThe GoodNow I don't want you to think this game is bad, I just wanted to list some of the downsides.\n\nA lot of story is convyed very well through the sets and the actions of the characters.  Without saying a word you know what they're thinking.  To me, that's great story telling.\n\nWhile sets are partially re-used for the Hero/Villain portions it's not an exact carbon copy.  It's often a different angle and different starting location meeting up somewhere.  This makes all the levels far more fleshed out.\n\nAll the characters are here, and are well portrayed.  Considering the game came out in 2008, you can see a lot of influence this game had on the Lego Movie.  And you can play as any character.  Theres even plenty of characters that aren't actually part of the game that are options.  You get additional playable characters that you unlock via playing the game instead of paying for DLC!\n\nThere are plenty of secrets and puzzles that award you for exploring and thinking.  All of which is needed to achieve the 100% completion (where youa are again, rewarded).\n\nI was actually surprised I could play as the villains too.  I think this is was a great move.  However when you play them is kind of odd.  To beat all 5 stages in a chapter (3 chapters), then you can switch to the villains.  When playing as the villains you see how it started, prior to playing the hero.  Basically, the sequal, is actually a prequal.\n\nThe free play mode is nice as you can just rotate through characters and the game does it quickly.  Even your side kick will change if there's an obstical it can't pass (like poison) so it can.  Most of the time, you don't have to babysit the AI (there are a few times, when trying to speed through you can get away from the AI and it doesn't know how to path to you.)\n\nLocal coop.  (I didn't actually test it, but I'm giving it a nod as many games overlook this)\n\nThere's a lot of attention to detail (saddly, wasted).  All the main characters are animated individually which brings a special personality to them.  The acrobatic characters if you press back and jump will actually do a backflip.  There's 3 different walk animations (creep, walk, run).  Characters will press up against walls to strafe against it (however, this is never required.)\n\nSuggested game playIn the event you pick this game up, let me give you some suggestions to save you some time and frustrations.\n\nFirst off, just play the game through, start to finish.  Don'y buy any upgrades, characters, etc.  (Henchmen are plentiful, they are all the same and are bad).  Once you've unlocked free play on all stages as well as all the main characters, that's when you want to go through and collect everything (still, don't buy upgrades).  This will save you a lot of time switching characters as a good portion are bad (special attack is poor, or non-existant and\or they offer nothing to help solve puzzles).\n\nA controller is far better then keyboard.  I didn't have a second controller to test if the local coop allows for dual controller of it you have to use one player controller and the other keyboard.","July 3, 2015","true","19.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Batman, the self-proclaimed World's Greatest Detective, is of course everybody's favourite super-hero. Suave billionaire by day, irascible crime-fighter by night and perennial money-spinner. LEGO on the other hand, like Disney, is just your typical moneygrubbing corporation that can be found wherever there's money to be made.\n\nThe origins of Batman have of course been repeated ad nauseam and does not need re-telling because everyone in the world knows it by heart and is sick to death of it. The slow-motion robbery flashback montage in almost every single Batman movie to remind the audience of Batman's tragic past is just a thinly-veiled attempt to garner sympathy for the character and about as subtle as a turkey slap from Batman himself.\n\nTo be fair, the problem of the rehashed tragic origin story is not specific to Batman but endemic to all Superheroes. For example, every fourth Spider-Man movie is required by Constitutional Law to be a re-boot just in case anyone ever forgot about poor Uncle Ben and his pithy aphorism "With great power comes great profits." Peter Parker, who was punch-drunk at the time, actually heard wrong and thought Uncle Ben said "responsibility" instead of "profits" which is why he lives in poverty taking sh*tty pictures for a living and chasing sirens like a cheap shyster.\n\nThe origins of LEGO are somewhat more mysterious. Conspiracy theorists have posited that LEGO was first brought to Earth in ancient times by over-zealous alien telemarketers selling do-it-yourself Pyramid sets. Pyramids were the status symbol du jour among Pharaohs for centuries but eventually became unpopular due to the excessive shipping fees from Alpha Centuri. Also, Kurt Russell killed their God[sg-x.org], which put a huge dent in relations.\n\nContemporary archaeologists naturally scoff at the Ancient Telemarketers Theory. Citing an obscure academic reference known only by its Latin name Weekeepeedeer, they claim that LEGO was founded in more recent times by some Viking dude calling his company leg godt which roughly translates as "overpriced plastic kak". Not to be confused with "Leg Goat" which means horny goats, or "Ladder Goat" which refers to goats of exceptional ability and probably the name you call your co-op partner after the third time he starts climbing a ladder and tearing the screen when you're trying to solve a puzzle.\n\nEarly Viking invasions were actually attempts to sell LEGO, but the burning and pillaging didn't help the sales message. The LEGO company motto is det bedste er ikke for godt which archaeologists have thus far failed to translate because nobody could be arsed getting a Danish-English dictionary, but they suspect it says "Don't get into bed with a goat" or something like that. True words of wisdom.\n\nModern LEGO technology has advanced considerably since the Viking days. Recently, life-sized giant LEGO-like blocks named EverBlocks were created by a particularly innovative inventor. These life-sized building blocks are not only cheap but robust enough to construct fully functioning furniture and structures. Not surprisingly, this generated a lot of interest from the scientific and engineering community. NASA, after recent ravaging budget cuts, have enthusiastically announced their intention to build the next Space Shuttle using EverBlocks and Duct Tape[uncyclopedia.wikia.com].\n\nAs for LEGO Batman, it's a simple 3-D action platformer crafted to appeal to younger gamers. The plot is rather mundane with the Joker (together with a bunch of other iconic villains) escaping from Arkham Asylum, the only maximum-security incarceration facility with an open door honour system. Gameplay is fairly straightforward, basically running around smashing bad guys and solving simple puzzles on the way to the inevitable Boss Fight. Beating a Batman mission unlocks the corresponding villain mission, allowing players to experience the game as their favourite villains. There are also plenty of collectibles and unlockables to encourage replay.\n\nWhilst it's a reasonably good game in solo mode, gaming with a co-op partner is where it shines. Local co-op is supported and Keyboard + Controller works well, but the lack of split-screen makes co-ordinating with your co-op partner essential, otherwise much shenanigans and hilarity will ensue. For a kid's game that doesn't take itself too seriously, it's surprisingly fun. What it lacks in complexity and sophistication, it more than makes up with charm and personality. Having played through this game to 100% with a 4-year old co-op partner, it's a definite two thumbs up from Batman and little Robin.","December 7, 2015","true","15.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Power-ups work well and are satisfying, the story mode enjoyable and the puzzles challenging enough. Sadly some of the levels are plagued with awkward glitches, notably with local multiplayer having sections that would repeatedly disconnect a player if they strayed too far from the zone on-screen. As an aside it can be repetitive at times to collect all the items, but this seems standard of most LEGO titles, especially if you're hoping to beat them 100%. The biggest downside is the vehicle portions, which are awkward to control and restrictive in progression.
