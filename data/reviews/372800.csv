The graphics and gameplay are very nostalgic and addictive, and I can honestly say that it wasn't hard to put a couple hundred hours into this game.  With that being said,  I can't recommend it -- why, you might ask?  It may sound cliche, but, that's right, you got it, the management. :/\n\n(*As an initial note, I have never been muted or banned in the entirety of my gameplay.*)\n\nI'm not going to generalize, because the majority of the mods (who simply love and play the game enough to volunteer their time to help keep the peace) are nice folks, and very level-headed.  However, it's impossible to play the game for a decent amount of time without witnessing at least couple of them (who shall remain unnamed), show an insane amount of bias towards certain players they like (who shall also remained unnamed), or act out in entirely immature ways that just cannot be respected.\n\nThis wouldn't be such a problem, except they are immune to criticism.  Openly voicing your concern will get you muted/banned (as I've witnessed happen on many occasions), and reporting said behavior to the developers is useless, because they also show favoritism and immaturity.  If you take a gander through posts and replies that the developer had made to reviews, you can view this child-like temperament in action.\n\nIt's a damn shame, because the game has promise, but I can't see suitable growth or longetivity in the future, simply because of the lack of professionalism.\n\nLong story short:\n\nPros -\n\n*Old-school flavor\n*Interesting maps to explore\n*Addictive gameplay\n*Consistent updates\n*Helpful and friendly player-base\n*Balanced cash shop\n\nCons -\n\n*No animations (as of yet)\n*Clunky movement\n*Little variation between different skills\n*Repetitive, mindless quests\n*Unprofessional and power abusive mods\n*Immature management\n\nPlaying RPG MO is like grinding away on one of your old nostalgic MMO's, all the while a rag-tag crew of fragile-egoed toddlers are in control of your account's fate.","October 25, 2015","false","254.8"," 183 of 204 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","183","204","4","5"

DO NOT BOTHER with this game unless you like tyrannical mods that apparently have complete control over you.

I wasn't KICKED I was BANNED for simply talking to other players about the game and it's creation. WITHOUT any kind of real warning and without actually violating any of the rules posted to me.

The community is horrible. There are some nice people, but there are more people that are just plain mean. Most of the admins are absolute a-holes. For a game that needs a community to survive, it's kind of a let down. Also, another problem is the chat. The chat is way to constricted, and almost nothing is allowed. You aren't allowed to say anything vulgar or mature, which is weird because kids have already heard all the slurs out there, but you are also not allowed to talk about games in any way, or your messages will be removed, you will be muted, or at worst, you will be banned. A while back I saw someone talk about how he/she loved a game when he/she was younger, and he/she was muted for "Advertising and Trolling". I don't remember the admin's name, but it started with "P00N". So anyways, don't try out this game. I mean, I can't stop you, but I just think you shouldn't even try it.\n\nEdit: Made my review a little less nice.\n\nEdit 2: A brief look at the community:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jQi7R49.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/YrMAnPo.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Lrp8wX7.png\n\nLooks like a fantastic community.\n\nEdit 3: And I bring you the finale:\nhttp://i.imgur.com/loYmlkf.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/kbzMi4s.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/SOHjthJ.png\nhttp://i.imgur.com/svtxHdw.png\n\nI thank you for your time. It's a wonder how something like this can get on Steam and get positive reviews. Check and mate.\n\nExtra final edit: The admins have told people in game to give a thumbs down to all negative reviews recently on a certain chat. I believe that this is against Steam rules. I just want to bring this up.\n\nYet another edit: A moderator (Poon) has made a four part long comment on this review that I deleted because of space. I took a picture of it, and I just wanted to say I didn't delete it because I disagree, it was just taking up a lot of space: http://i.imgur.com/VcOwGgl.png\nI also accidentally deleted another persons comment that was after this 4 parter, thankfully it happened to be in the screenshot I took: http://i.imgur.com/f3oLZ7f.png\n\nThe mods/admins are really getting sensitive over this post, for some reason. Also yeah, I can't prove that the thumbs down thing is true, and you probably won't trust me because "loyal players", but still.\n\nAnd LOL at "Poon means Pwn"","August 22, 2015","false","17.7"," 257 of 368 people (70%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","70","257","368","37","52"

Way back when around 2006? Do you remember booting it up, creating your character and diving into a world of mystery and wonder? The first thing you did was chop a tree down, light a campfire and start to fish. RPG MO does that without a tinderbox. Do you remember going into the mines, mining your first tin and copper and smelting it? And then forging your own set of bronze armor because you couldn't yet afford that? RPG MO can show you how to do the same. Do you remember seeing someone with a cool pet, or seeing skills you couldn't use because you had to actually buy a membership, or feeling restricted by the landscape itself?\n\nRPG MO laughs and says, go. Be free. Do whatever foolish or amazing things you want. Kill a cow with magic. Cut a wizard down with the axe you forged with your own hands.\n\nBut remember: Much like the Runescape of '06, this game is still learning.

It's "grindy" in the way you level up skills, similar to Runescape. There's breeding so you can breed your own rare pets, there's farming to grow your own plants/food, carpentry to build houses, extra storage space, ect.\n\nThere's a ton of different monsters, a built in wiki that's always up to date, some of the crafting is similar to Minecrafts (where you have to place ingredients in a certain kind of way). There's tons of different items, ways to gear, ways to level, there's constant updates, the game is completely kid friendly.\n\nThere is a cash shop, but it really isn't that horrible. You can spend some money to save some time grinding, but it's not going to sky rocket you ahead. In fact most of the richest players on the game don't even use the cash shop.\n\nThe game is completely free to play with no restrictions, so you've got absolutely nothing to lose.

You can have as much grind as you want.\n\nYou can grind wood, grind food, grind loot, grind plants, grind magic, and so on and so on.\nThis game starts and from the begining, when you is open to grind and goes with it. No quests, except grinding mobs and whatever you can decide. No grafic fidelity. No skill based dodging and combat. Ultimate grindfest.\nSo if you miss old days Linage II c1 you can have your grind here.\n\nIs this a bad thing?\n\n\nI think not. It's grind you see, but with clicker games expanding nowadays, this game stand it's ground. Yep it is essentially numbers grindfest, but it is more complex, than clickers. If you want to mine lets say iron, and not cooper - you need to find a way to do it, passing through or killing mobs. You have inside game wiki, that shows drop rates and all item stats, and you quickly start to understand that 0.25% chance of drop is pretty high. And the best thing that game is very rewarding and funny, when you start to grasp its mechanics.\n\nLet me give you some examples.\n\n\n\nAs an mmo this game have a pet system. Do you know fastest way to get pet here? Grind and buy? Grow from cheap pet? No. Buy 10 ham, take a hammer, go to anville and bash ham into a piglet. With 1% you will succeed. 1% is a very high chance for this game. And ham is cheap.\n\nThere is heaven and hell, and ancient dungeons.\nTo go to heaven and kill some angels you will need wings.\nDo you know fastest way to get wings ? 0.25% chase drop from some fairly weak mobs. But they will not let you go to heaven. To get to heaven you need to grind some lvl 1 chickens to get 8 feathers (drop chance 0.25%), and then craft wings of path with 50% chance.\n\n\n\nThis game have high imagination involvement. Just imagine how badass will you feel, when you go to heaven, kill a lot of angels and archangels, adopt some smaller angels and rise them as your "pets", then go to hell and do the same thing with demons, then breed angels and demons to get some awesome genetic modified pets with some cool wings, and then freaking rip their wings off to wear them yourself.\n\nPotentially you can kill, raise and breed dragons, you can kill titans, demons, angels, and death itself, you can do whatever hell you want and feel total badass.\n\nPlus this thing works on mobile devices and tablets as far as I know.\n\nConclusion.\n\nIs this a game you will enjoy? Depends on how well can you setup and follow your own goals, and how persistent you are, until you get there. If you want story driven experience, and "everything on a plate" this is not a game for you. If you can google, use wiki, analise drop chances and best grind roots, optimising loss/profit balance (or you wish to learn it) - you will like it a lot.","September 1, 2015","true","199.1"," 71 of 93 people (76%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","76","71","93","27","4"

In the end, I'm giving it a thumbs-down.\n\nAbsolutely everything possible if you're willing to devote the time? Your own private island? Farming and fishing? Olden-tymie graphics? Free-fer-realsies? On paper, this is my perfect game.\n\nUnfortunately, the whole game feels like it's been dragged out of some boarded-up back closet and forced into daylight.

A small and tame example: I wanted to build a house on my island because, hello, a house on my island. Each square of floor requires 300 logs. Your maximum capacity, between inventory and pets, is 55. There is a set rate/speed at which chopping can be attempted, and a high chance of failing to score yourself a single log. There is also a hike between where you can chop trees and where you can stash the logs for future building.\n\nThis is also one of the lowest tier woods and one that's easily accessible. We're not even talking walls and furniture yet.\n\nI'm sorry, RPG MO.

You can play this game through your internet browser as well, which is where I played most of the time. I found the game on Steam and then switched to browser once I found out about it.\n\nOriginal Review:\nDon't be decieved by the Steam release date. This game has been out for 4 years and only has 2 main developers. They are taking an incredibly long time to update the game and it doesn't look like it will be finished any time soon. Maybe in another 3 years it will be close to finished. There's lots of inbalance in gear, and their item store is very decieving. As a new player do NOT buy the Firelord gear in the store because although people in chat tell you that it is among the best equipment in the game, what they don't tell you is that it requires 15 upgrades to become the best gear in the game, and you'll never have enough coins to upgrade the gear unless you've been playing the game hardcore for over a year. The Firelord gear is only for veterans and new players are always sucked into buying it. It will help you as a new player for the first few weeks of playing, but after that when it's time to upgrade the equipment to level 2, you won't have anywhere near the amount of currency for even 1 upgrade, not to mention 14 upgrades after that for each piece of the set.\n\nAnd everyone was right, mods are very sensitive and ban people for no good reason. At first I didn't have a problem with the mods and I figured only the people who deserve to be muted are muted by the mods, but then I started noticing very unfair calls by the mods, and very inappropriate bans. After just 4 days of seeing the way the mods were acting in chat, I felt very bitter toward them even without having talked to one personally.\n\nOn another note, chat is VERY sensored. Chat feels like the game is hosted in North Korea. Better watch what you say or off with your head! And I mean if the apple is red don't call it pink, or off with your head! And the community is very toxic more than 1/2 the time. It is a very small community and you better not make any suggestions to improve the game unless you're ready to get beat up. Want to cause an uproar? Mention something about the game's graphics being updated for higher quality, something along those lines. You will cause a riot.\n\nThere are a few very helpful players in the game and they are were incredibly nice to me. Those few helpful players reached out to me and answered all of my questions and even gave me very expensive items to start out with (expensive for me anyways). Those few players made the game very enjoyable, but unfortunately the community is toxic most of the time. If you play the game for hours on end you will see what I'm talking about. Or if you get lucky and only log in for 1-2 hours you might luck out and miss the toxicity.\n\n\nUltimately, it is the toxic community (moderators included) that made me quit this game and ask for a full refund on my credit card for all in-game purchases. Yes, it is the community that drove me away from this game, namely 45% players 55% moderators = 100% enough for me to quit.","April 26","false","10.2"," 70 of 95 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","70","95","5","11"

These people broke the chat rules by posting profanity in EN chat or talking about other games, both explicitly big no-nos.  They asked for it.  What the moderators DIDN'T do is mute them or ban their accounts, instead erasing only the offending messages and warning the violator that what they posted isn't acceptable.\n\nIn other words, they did their jobs.\n\nI have also seen these same moderators answering questions from newer players, farming items and offering to sell them at reasonable prices to new players to help them get their feet on the ground, offering to forge beginner equipment for people (sometimes free of charge), and otherwise being very helpful people.  The same can be said for most of the other players.  Overall, if you ask a question, you'll get a reasonable response, even if that response is to check the wiki (why wouldn't you?  It's a great source of information!)  Sometimes, the best way to respond to a question is to refer people to an outside source of information that answers that question, as well as the other couple of dozen frequently asked questions people might have about the game.  Answering questions one at a time doesn't teach people how to help themselves, it just teaches them to rely on other people, right?\n\nNow, the downside...it's grindy.  Very grindy.  Runescape-level grindy.  If you like that, you're in for some fun.  If you don't like it, you're going to hate this game.  I personally don't mind it, it gives me something to do to pass the time, and there's a sense of accomplishment in finishing a goal in the game that's very satisfying.\n\nMy other complaint is the captcha system.  Now, I fully understand the purpose of the system.  It's designed to keep people from botting the game, requiring human interaction at random intervals, and I do appreciate the fact that the game actually rewards you for being there to answer the captcha in the form of free experience that you can assign to a skill of your choice (giving you an alternate way to get your first few dozen or so levels on a skill that's otherwise a severe pain in the ♥♥♥ to grind), but it feels like they're almost too frequent at times.  I've had a couple of occasions where I've been mining away, working on cooking dinner, I answer a captcha and think "okay I'm good for a while", get up for 5-10 minutes to go cook food, and come back to an angry message saying I missed a captcha and I'm at -1 reward points and if I hit -5 I'm effectively banned for botting (they call it jail, and admins/moderators can let you out of it, but I wouldn't imagine they'd tend to do that often.  If you miss that many captchas, you're doing something you shouldn't be).  It's a minor complaint, though.\n\nOverall, the game so far has been satisfying.  It's free to play, that's always a bonus.  The community IS helpful, contrary to popular representation.  The moderators aren't sadistic, power-hungry maniacs looking to ruin the experience of newer players and only playing to their preferred cliques.  And the best part is, there's ways to earn MOS (that's the RL-purchasable currency that lets you buy premium items and/or account status) ingame, so you can earn some of those "pay-to-win" perks without even paying for them.  Granted, it'll take forever and a day, but hey, it's there, right?\n\nDon't play into the hype that some of the negative comments are trying to feed you.

(This is great, search prices, informatino about items, NPCs etc.)\n-In game map that states how to get to all areas.\n-No cap on Skills\n-Decently large amount of items, enemies and places\n-Global 2x experience when someone uses a 2x experience buff (This makes it less of a "Pay to win" game.)\n-Completely player run economy\n-Mods that make the User interface more friendly and makes multiple actions possible. (Mods are maintained by players.)\n-Cross platform. ( Runs through browsers, Steam, a Downloadable .exe, and an app on Android. Can be played literally anywhere.)\n-Most experienced players help out by answering questions to those who ask.\n-All items that can be bought with real money can also be bought with ingame currency from other players. (You don't have to spend real money to get the paid items.)\n-Party questing, as well as PvP.\n-The ability to subscribe and unsunscribe to multiple chat rooms. (Less annoying when you don't see bothersome people.)\n\nOn that note. There are some people who complain about the mass amount of bans/mutes that happen in the chat. That is in the basic chat and usually it's full of people trolling and asking to get banned or muting by blatantly disregarding the rules. It is possible to change chats and go to chats where the rules are much more lax. The mods are all pretty friendly and only bring down the hammer when completely needed.\n\nCons:\n-It is a huge grind (That is the intent of the game though so if you don't like grinds this game is not for you.)\n-The community is pretty small (Some may see this as a good thing, making it more tight knit.)\n-The antibot system is seriously annoying. (However, the do compensate the annoyance with experience which means you can train other skills and use the captcha experience to train other things.)\n-There is little to no animation in the game.\n-Can't cut all trees even though they are shown (This is more of a minor annoyance of mine as someone who Woodcuts mainly.)\n\ntl;dr: It's a casual, grindy game that you can sink 100s of hours into playing with a small-ish community that is generally pretty friendly. Only a few minor annoyances.","March 1","true","465.6"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","35","41","3","0"

Hovering over any item name should provide what the item is and does, without having to search the wiki.

Hoarding loot is something that a lot of people into this genre of game like to do.  And limiting that ability can really take away from the experience.On the chat moderation\n\nSo far I've noticed a number of the negative reviews commenting on the chat moderation.  I have a few thoughts on that.\n-First off, The game is trying to create a community that isnt toxic, which we can all universally agree is a problem for every online game site that doesn't take precautions to stop it.\n- The complaints seem to come from people who are unable to obey the several rules that are frequently warned against by the in game tips, and the mods themselves.  In other words, they are banning people who are unable to follow rules and then rage.  This is a perfectly acceptable response from the mods side.  If a person is unable to follow basic chat etiquette, then there is no need to keep them around.\n\nEdit:  I only played this game over the course of a week, and have recieved several comments showcasing how the mods are in fact quite biased.

I will cover the basics in sections below:\n\nThe WorldLike RuneScape Classic, the world uses a 4-sided grid-based system for movement and interaction, and unlike RuneScape Classic, which has a more or less seamless world, it is split into a number of square "regions" separated by loading screens. These regions seem to exist merely as a place to store the many mobs for players to kill as well as various resources, rather than seeming like a functioning world that could actually exist. As such, exploration isn't all that enticing unless the player wants a more difficult monster to kill or needs a specific material.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics in RPG MO are by far more primitive than RuneScape Classic. The game is entirely 2D whereas RuneScape Classic was 3D with 2D sprites. Animations are basically nonexistent: I think I've seen one: the sparkling effect for magic spells. When walking, you just glide about. Even with combat, the characters just stand there as hitsplats pop up. For actions such as mining as fishing, images of fishing poles and pickaxes appear above the character just as in RuneScape Classic. You are very limited in the design of your character: there are about twenty styles of hair, with most of them just being recolors. When clicking to move to tiles, the selected tile's borders glitch out with pixelation. When moving, the edge of the screen shows a background image for about half a second before buffering in the actual tile contents. Resizing the game window only stretches what can be currently seen rather than loading in more of the world, and I get a good bit a screen tearing when I display the game at anything other than its native resolution. In short, it's ugly, and there is very little in the area of graphical options.\n\nAudioThe audio in RPG MO is minimalistic. There is music, which RuneScape Classic lacked apart for the menu screen, which RPG MO has no music for. Each region seems to have a track each, and it does get very monotonous. As for sound effects, it's pretty much the same as with RuneScape Classic: a short sound plays when doing various actions, although the combat sounds are not nearly as annoying.\n\nUser InterfaceRPG MO's user interface is clunky. I have trouble controlling my character, and have to wait for each movement command to carry out before issuing a new one to get them to do what I want consistently. The local map constantly flickers with buggy pixelation, similar to what you might see in a poorly-compressed jpeg image. The inventory system is straight out of RuneScape Classic, where you have to hover over the button to open the inventory every time you want to access it, which serves no point when the game window isn't tiny. The smithing/forging uses a system similar to Minecraft, where you have to make a certain shape to specify what item you want, which, since there is a wiki built into the game, serves no purpose but to impede the player's ability to play the game. The shapes used are rather unintuitive as well, seemingly for no reason. There seems to be no way to close the chat interface, just reduce it in size to one line plus its title. Speaking of the chat, there is no local chat and the global? chat is essentially useless with how much spam there is. Luckily you can turn off player messages, and just keep the game messages. The most annoying part of the user interface, though, is when a Captcha randomly appears in the middle of your screen that you have to solve as an anti-botting measure. Fail enough of them, and you'll be banned. RuneScape Classic had this too, but in a much more seamless way with a system of fatigue that you had to sleep and solve a Captcha to recover.\n\nSkillsRPG MO has many skills which exist in RuneScape Classic, albeit some are renamed, and a few that do not exist in it. You still have attack (renamed accuracy), strength, defense, hits (renamed health), magic, herblaw (renamed alchemy), woodcutting, fishing, cooking, crafting (renamed jewelry), smithing (renamed forging), and mining. Like RuneScape 2, RPG MO also has farming and construction (renamed carpentry). The most unique skill is breeding, which encompasses breeding pets which help the character, similar to how you can summon creatures to help you in RuneScape 2. RPG MO also has no thieving, agility, firemaking, ranged, or prayer skills. Training skills works much the same as in RuneScape Classic, complete with the enormous amount of grinding.\n\nCombatThe combat in RPG MO is almost a direct copy of RuneScape Classic's. You click to attack, and hits are automatically exchanged. Magic can be cast mid-combat, albeit with scrolls held in a pouch in the shield slot rather than with runes. The system of choosing between attack/accuracy, strength, and defense experience via combat style is still in place, although experience is granted on hit rather than on kill, and you must cycle between them rather than choosing from a menu, making it easy to accidentally gain experience in an unwanted skill. Equipment and weapons use the same "aim", "power", and "armour" system. Unlike RuneScape Classic, there doesn't seem to be any sort of ranged combat whatsoever, and loot is automatically placed in the player's inventory upon defeating your enemy.\n\nProgressionLike others have said, this game is very grindy. I'm personally okay with grindy, but the problem with RPG MO is that there really doesn't seem to be anywhere to go other than to the stuff that requires higher levels. I can kill 200 rats so that I can kill 200 orcs, so that I can kill 200 vampires, so on and so forth, but there doesn't seem to be any point to it all. The only quests I found were more tasks rather than quests, and with the lackluster exploration, dull combat, and lack of player interaction, there doesn't seem much point in playing rather than making arbitrary numbers increase.\n\nConclusionIn short, I simply can't recommend RPG MO unless someone really likes solving Captchas, wants to experience online gaming in 1997 without the dialup, or just really happens to like this sort of simplistic grinding game. It seems to be recreating the games of old, complete with flaws, rather than taking the core concepts and gameplay and improving upon them with the power of modern hardware, internet speeds, and programming languages. In it's current state, I feel that it's more of an inferior rendition of RuneScape Classic rather than its own game.","August 22, 2015","false","4.1"," 101 of 153 people (66%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","66","101","153","9","0"

You get anywhere from a day to a week, maybe two weeks of what is reasonable grinding (depending on your play time) before you realize how boring the game is really getting, and that working towards the endgame on .... this..? ... is just not worth it.\n\nPros: more or less what others have been saying\n- tons of stuff to grind on.\n- theres a grind house\n- theres farmgrindville\n- theres monsterclick grinding\n- theres mobile grinding from your android/iphone\n- tons of rewards for grinding. sometimes. maybe.  0.15-0.25% of the possible time. (this is actually good, maybe, if you like clicking on things a lot...)\n\nCons: also, more or less what everyone says...\n- mods are hit or miss, i've seen borderline explicit convos including mods in general EN chat and i've seen them censor and been censored for things which even tame people questioned in chat.

I like slow open RPGs (both SP and MMOs) where main focus is on crafting. I also like the aesthetics.\n\nThe things I really don't like is the extremely tedious UI. I don't think that every game needs to solve UI problems the same way as other games, but I really can't get used to the inventory system: In order to put anything from your inventory to your stash you need to click on the object in question in STASH and click on "deposit" in stashes lower right corner... And If you do it wrong (click on your inventory like in any other game) you might destroy your eqipment.\n\nThe battles are very simple (I didn't mind that) but very unreactive. Once you are in the battle it's extremely difficult to escape... And you die... And you have to recraft your equipement. When it comes to dying in games I am of a very strong opinion that you need to deserve your death: When you die it should be always because YOU as a player didn't make the challenge. Accidental deaths simply doesn't do it for me. And every single death in this game was accidental. I accidently started a battle with wrong equipement in my hands and wasn't given a chance to change it mid combat, or I accidently started a battle with strong opponent. I never felt that I died because lack of my skills.\n\nThe whole core of the game is crafting. It's not interesting enough.\n\nBut the absolutely worst design decision in the game is definitely the captcha leveling system. During my whole play time I got about 20-30 captcha tests when my character progressed in skills. If you fail the test you will not "level up" and if you fail 5 times you will get banned. To begin with it's extremely tedious. Second: The game playes itself in your absence while you make the test. You will continue mining too long... And sometimes fight a opponent you want to escape from. Third: This system messes with the controlls. If you press "enter" one time too many and use arrows to move (or escape) you will be changing languages in chat instead. It's very hard to notice that. For most users it will simply look like you can't use your keybord any more.","January 2","false","8.3"," 35 of 49 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","35","49","0","0"

I only finished the tutorial in hopes that it was still a work in progress and I'd find something remotely engaging on the other side, but I was left in a town with a tab that had a quest to kill stuff.\n\nI gather their might be a cash shop involved as it was free, but I was so unimpressed with the game I didn't even look at what was available\n\nFeels like a tech demo that still needs a lot of work (and is missing the whole game design element).\n\nWriting this review has now held my attention longer than actually playing RPG MO did.\n\n","August 21, 2015","false","0.7"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","31","48","2","0"

Now dont get me wrong things like a house are a status symbol and should take time and such so the ammounts needed for a floor tile a 1/1 being 100 logs I cant understand. But when you are going about cutting these logs you cant even hold enough in one trip of logging to make one!\n\nSo my onlt problem is the storage and gathering system. Items either need to be transported to your storage by a pet Or they need to be stackable I have spent five hours here and have just a few floor tiles to show for it at my place. That is doing nothing but logging to make them off a level 1 tree.\n\nUntill Something is doing abut this half done storage system nothing appeals about this game. It has no story no real drive to it nothing its bare bones and dated. You can find 15-30 other free to play games out there that look better and are free and give you 10xs as much for the time you got to put in to get anything on this.\n\nAlso after doing more research I find this game was released to the public on Kong in 2012 I mean really and it still makes steam early acess it has a running cash shop always has and a list of other things. This is not a early acess game Its not even a Half attempt at making a good game that has been out and playable since 2012 !!!.","February 27","false","18.6"," 38 of 62 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","38","62","3","1"

I think this is a really important part, because in my experience the tutorial sequence can be kind of an information-overload and afterwards, you're dropped into the “real world” and off you go!\nSeeing as the wiki is not very in depth yet, you'll find that asking the community for help will yield positive results (most of the time)!\n\n\nAlright,\n\nI'm definitely getting serious Runescape vibes from this game, in a GOOD way.\nLike the days when you caught shrimps in a fishing net and you still had to kill those blue rats down in the dungeon/cave on Tutorial Island...  Nostalgia and fond memories. :)\n\n\nThis game basically has a lot of the same skills like RS, for example AT/STR/DEF/HP and prayer.\n\nFrom my point of view, graphics aren't important. This game looks colourful, has nice backgroundmusic and plays smoothly once you get used to the mechanics (like "you can only eat food when you're DONE fighting or after running away).\nIt really throws you back into the days of grinding those stats, crafting that junk till you could make better junk, looking for rare drops/random events...\n\nNow this game is Early Access, so the interface feels very basic and looks a bit unfinished. But that's not a big deal, because the game itself is already very enjoyable to play. I have faith they're going to bring nothing but improvements to this game.\n\n\nAnd hey, even if they don't: it's Totally Free 2 Play! No member-restricted areas or member-only items or events or any of that bullcrap. You can explore the whole world. I think this game ain't even 200Mb in size, so it's installed in like 10 seconds. Just give it a go and if you think it's boring, then no harm done.\n\nSo if you (used to) like Runescape, you should definitely give this a try!","March 14","true","15.0"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","13","18","0","0"

It doesn't have to be as good because it's such a unique game in its own right. It makes me feel very nostalgic and generally just content.\n\nWhile these kinds of games are not for everyone, but if you're like me and enjoy the grind of collecting resources and slowly leveling lots of different and diverse skills, I recommend you give this one a go.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anime365/recommended/372800/","Anime365","Prinny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anime365/","530 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nJust started playing this game, about 3 hours in as of this review. I have to say, this game is rather addicting, I can't seem to stop playing! Right when you start, If you've ever played Utlima or Runescape Classic, you get THAT kind of nostalgic feel from it. I knew I would like this game the moment I played it because Runescape Classic was fun as well, although I never played Ultima before. Currently, there are 15 skills you can level up, all of which have NO level cap. However, the SOFT cap is 120, meaning 120 is basically a practical maximum, but no absolute, so you CAN have say 200 mining potentially, but it would take a really long time as anything past the soft cap is pretty hard to obtain.\n\nStarting the tutorial, it looked really close together, and the text i couldn't really focus on with everything else around me. Hopefully that gets refurbished soon. But the tutorial explains mostly everything considered you actually paid attention. One thing I don't believe they explain much are the shops around RPG MO. In the starting town, Dorpat, there are a number of vendors you can sell your items to. But beware, these vendors only buy low-level types of things. So, low level fish, low level weapons you forge, etc. To sell other types of items you can either click on your chest (bank), and then the market to sell your items. Or you could move to the other towns in RPG MO, where the npc's buy higher leveled items.\n\nIf you want to make money fast right when you start this game, I suggest mining/forging once you get to the iron stage (not very high ) you can sell iron helmets and make around 200k in an hour (considering you successfully make them with a high chance, and not fail most of the time.) With Iron, (like Runescape) There is a chance they do not get forged into bars. Fishing is okay, but at a high level. You could try your chances and sell your fish in the market.\n\nI saw some negative reviews about people being banned because they posted some things in the chat. There are about 5 types of chat. All you really need to know is EN (English) is the PG chat, meaning no language, no talking about other games, and more. Try using the ST (Steam) chat, or /join 18 for the 18+ chat. It's not my fault you didn't read the rules, or the tips that appear throughout the game.\n\nThe games virtual currency, MOS can be bought or earned (in extremely low quanities) from quests. MOS can be used to buy all types of goodies in the MOS shop. One of the most used items is the 2x EXP, which cost $5 and yields 30 minutes of EXP. Ever since the steam release there has been a LOT of this stuff bought, even 10 hours at a time. Usually when one gets going, people add on to it and it builds up. So take advantage, play now!\n\ntl;dr: Old school game is awesome, nice community. I recommend this game, 8/10.","September 3, 2015","true","90.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","18","28","2","1"

Antibotting:  The nature of the captcha system vs. the nature of this game.  It encourages you to go afk by automatically crafting/fishing/cooking/etc. without repeated clicks.  So when you go afk to do something in real life, the captcha system comes up and tells you you'll be banned.  It's one of the worst mistakes such a crappy little game can make, and I cannot support them in making it.\n\n2. Powertrippers:  I'm not sure why, but every chat room is filled with unrealistically pompous moderators.  People with their heads so far up their own asses that they threaten 50% of the playerbase every time I look at the chat.  I chose not to get involved with them, but it was quite enough to watch the way they treated new players.\n\nIf they fix these two issues, this grindy little game could take up far more of my time.

It's certainly not a perfect game (as if anything is), and you will occasionally lose some progress if you die. It's also every bit as grindy as everyone says. All things considered, though, the game mostly handles things in a fair manner. Even though you have to grind a lot for professions, it's worth doing. Plus, you don't have to click constantly to gather resources; the game automatically handles that, as long as you're standing next to the resource you're gathering. Just make sure you don't walk away for more than 3 minutes while the automation is going, or you may miss a random captcha pop-up. Also, the community has been helpful the few times I've had a question, but mostly I keep to myself.\n\nBottom line:  RPG MO is a fun, free and enjoyable casual game.","May 2","true","12.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"

It has been a long time since I've played an mmo that uses skill based progression rather than throwing numbers at your stat counts. I enjoy the rogue-like feeling that the game has with the constant worry of death taking everything from you but your two most valuable items. Stats are a grind and the music can get repetitive after a while however I can forgive the music while watching my favorite live streams in the background (KPE3 at the time of this review) however I can truly enjoy the serenity that this game offers behind what is simply pixels. They also have ways to boost you and keep you from idling, example: after playing for a while they will jump you with a captcha, they give you two minutes to solve it and upon completion they give you a "Captcha point" Captcha points can be placed into any of the games skills and is essentially a free instant skill level. Now for the negatives I noticed within this first hour. I expect the tutorial to be a bit jarring and hard to understand for some people but if you have more than 3 days of accumulative gaming in your life for sandbox styled mmo's or 4 years of general gaming then it should be easy to understand (I have been gaming for 11 years). The second error is that the menu feels crammed and there is little space between your chat bar and the inventory bar, it's easily fixable however so no worries. Combat however does in fact feel like people throwing numbers at eachother. A positive that I failed the mention earlier was it's forging system, it takes the minecraft approach in which you shape out what you want to craft, luckily you only have to craft a piece of equipment once for it to be permanently in your list of known recipes, that's good because of the game stealing away all your hard earned equipment upon death except for your two most valuable items and pay to win doesn't seem to exist however as other reviews have stated I have done the same, I have not played PVP yet. Why? Because I feel that the true gems in a sandbox game come from it's worlds and what you can make of them.\n\n7.5/10\n\nEDIT: This game also used to be a browser game so theres that.\nEDIT2: When I said that the captcha points were instant skill levels I was wrong, they grant 100 EXP to the skill you select to spend them on, which tends to be instant levelling up to skill level 9.","August 19, 2015","true","15.0"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","15","24","0","2"

Strict but that is nice to see when you have games where no one is ever muted. generally if you behave yourself and simply ask questions or carry light conversations your fine, if you want more they off less moderated channels like (18).\n\nIt does have a high learning curve as most of the information you have to track down via the forums/wiki or Fan sites and even still much of them have broken links and outdated content... even you tube is kinda light on many things. But if you are willing to spend some effort in learning the basics, the player base is more likely to help you out...just need to know what to ask for :)\n\nNo crashes, However in full screen (Game Size 2.25x) its really apparent that on the sides of the screen when moving is distorted a bit like inverted colors.\n\nThis is a Multi platform game -> playing on steam you already have mods enabled by default. Means things a little easier with interfaces.\n\nThey do have a way to buy in game currency for Items that go back into the market.. Thus pay for gold, however at lower levels this isn't necessary just saves hours of leveling to get some scratch together.\n\nAll in All, I'm enjoying myself. But this is a niche game ...to each there own. Hope this was helpful.","May 23","true","30.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The one and only drawback is the chat system. You have EN, steam, 18+ chats but by far the most active channel is EN. But you can't actually talk in EN with any sort of freedom because of the backward ♥♥♥ rules. I've never played an online game that surpressed what you can say (outside of cussing) so hard. Every day it's the same ♥♥♥♥ being spammed into chat, muted, muted, muted, banned, banned, banned. All because of an overly nazi chat mod system. Chat mods staring over your shoulder to make sure you don't casually talk about runescape classic waiting to ban you doesn't make a game a success. Ruins the game. Adopt a chat system like every single other online game in the world. You aren't saving your game by making sure EN is a "PG" chat channel especially when mods have names like P00n. Really PG. Relax the chat rules they ruin the game.","September 2, 2015","false","124.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It was a BLATANT abuse of moderator powers by the player named "stahna" muting me for 24 hours after breaking ZERO rules. I will admit I used 1 derogatory comment by saying "Nazi mods". However people say MUCH worse on a daily basis and only have their chat line removed. So why was I issued a 24 hour mute? Great question, it beats the hell out of me so I'll just start at the beginning.\n\nI woke up this morning and participated in a online poker tournament that won me a fairly sizable sum of money. Naturally I was in a great mood and feeling generous I felt like logging into RPG MO and giving away some of my 20+ million coins in "EN" chat for answering random trivia questions. This was all in good fun to change from the typical arguments which were taking place there about silly things such as peoples views on alternate realities and other such things. It lasted for roughly 45 minutes and I ended up giving away roughly 10-12 million coins all in fun. I started to get PM's and complaints about the questions so I decided to stop.\n\nLess than two minutes after I made the announcement to STOP doing the trivia,Stahna makes a moderator anouncement that "SPAM and TRIVIA will not be tolerated in the END channel as its SPAM and the channel is designated for noobs to be able to ask questions". To this I replied and asked how it was spam, that it was good for the game and noobs got to participate and potentially earn TONS of coin. During the ENTIRE trivia process there were maybe ONE or TWO out of 30+ people in chat being negative.  Stahna got an attitude when questioned how I was breaking the rules and simple said "that's enough drop it". Instead of explaining what rule I broke, just a blatant abuse of power because I refused to follow his/her command and let it go. I to my CORE, believe in free speech and live in America and while that is neither here nor there its ignorant to continue to let someone moderate chat that obviously does not have the best intentions for the game.\n\nHow on earth can someone trying to bring a little joy to peoples mornings by sharing wealth in your game with a fun little trivia be a bad thing?! The channel was convoluted with arguing before I started the giveaway. He or She took NO effort into stopping the arguements, therefore how can she or he have ANY basis for wanting to stop my trivia game that most people were enjoying!?\n\n\nHere is the conversation the couple minutes leading up to my being muted. UNEDITED in any way.\n\n[img]http://i57.tinypic.com/qs86pv.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i62.tinypic.com/ngrbpf.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i60.tinypic.com/2zdougi.jpg[/img]\n\n[img]http://i58.tinypic.com/30a42ky.jpg[/img]\n\n\n\nIn closing let me simply say this, I love and support RPG MO since I found it. I personally have spent well over $100 in the 7-10 days since I've created my account. However this stops immediately until this situation is resolved. This mute was unjustified, and wrong. Plain and simple, moderators need to enforce the rules of chat, not abuse their power because their ego can't handle being questioned which is exactly what happened to me.","September 21, 2015","false","67.3"," 29 of 52 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","29","52","2","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sqodd/recommended/372800/","sqodd","♕ SQODD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sqodd/","21 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game takes the concept of grinding far beyond the celestial realm of grinding as you have already known it to exist in other games. It is exceptionally more grindy than it initially leads you to believe; you're lured in with skills that level very, very quickly because of the constant double experience time that freemium players pay for. Seriously, someone just paid for 26 hours of 2x exp - $420 worth. There is a massive plateau from about combat level 50 to combat level 100, at the very least, where the seemingly efficient way to gain any money or combat XP is to farm Efreet spawns. They're high leveled but drop the illustrious Efreet 'pet', which can be sold on the market for about $400k gold. Unfortunately, they have a 0.25% drop rate, like practically everything else in the game.\n\nThe creators of RPG-MO are sadistic in their pursuit to make you grind and grind and grind your life away to get that one Efreet pet, or that one Paladin Shield, or that one ____ (any item). In other traditional RPGs, a high level skill like mining or forging should yield a steady income of gold that increases in proportion to the level. RPG-MO works on a leveling system that exponentially makes leveling harder while providing minimal, if even at all, positive gains. Want to be a high level forger and make sapphire weapons? That sounds great! You only need 60 forging, but how are you going to get to the azurite ore if the only two azurite spots in the game are guarded by level 150 mobs? The sad part is – sapphire isn't even high tier weaponry. And if you finally do survive long enough to start smelting azurite bars into sapphire weaponry? Well, the game has such horrid 'success rates' for most forged items that you're probably going to waste most of the bars you just painstakingly made. And if you do manage to make a sapphire sword? You get just about the same XP as if you had made a lower-tier steel sword.\n\nUltimately, I don't recommend this game until the creators make all the drop rates much, much more tolerable. Once you hit about combat level 60, the game becomes frustratingly hard to make any sort of vertical progress in terms of new gear... unless you farm Efreets. But even if you're farming Efreets, good luck with that 0.25% drop rate!","August 25, 2015","false","243.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The community is the best community I ever encountered , they\nall help you and they're mature and friendly.\nAnother great thing is the player market , you can sell anything and let's say you're a blacksmith , you make armor\nand other people buy it and you earn money to buy jewerly that is made by an uhm... jewerly maker? (is that what he's called?) , so yeah you can earn money and stuff which is kinda cool.\nThe next great awesome thing is the world , the world is huge huge huge , the first town you'll see is Dorpat , everything is easy there , the mobs are easy to kill , you can mine iron , clay , tin and copper over there.\nOther places you'll see in your first 20 hours are probably Reval and Whilland , you'll go to Reval to mine gold which you can sell for good money and you might go to Whilland to kill deers for the quests. (Which are also a good addition because you earn money or MOS from them.)\nMOS? Oh , MOS is a premium-ish currency you can use to buy things , I call it premium-ish because you can buy it with real money or you can earn it in game by completing different kind of quests or dungeons or by daily rewards which are also freaking amazing!\nDouble xp is also awesome , you can buy it with MOS or get it for completing some stuff (boss-es , dungeons...) , When double xp  arrives , you basicaly level your skills twice the speed and that can be helpfull with loot consuming skills such as forging , cooking or jewerly...or fletching but i dont like fletching...\nAnyways this is a good good game and it's worth playing if you have a bad pc.\nOh and also you can play it on your phone , just go onto your browsers , type in RPG MO and voila!\n10/10 would waste hours and hours on 2 million$ worth of white gold :'D","May 4","true","92.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

Someone in game said something about sleeping in a bed, which was not helpful at all. Or if you have plenty of time and don't mind just standing on the same tile for ever, your health will very slowly return 1hp a minute.\n\nThere is very little animation here, you char is basically a stick figure that never changes. Walking or doing anything else for that matter all uses the exact same unchanging image. You do get a few choices to alter the head, facial hair, chest and lower body, basically just different colours. But so small a choice that it is impossible to differentiate between players. It's like half a dozen choices as to what chars look like and several of each onscreen at the same time. The only way to find who you’re looking for is to hold the mouse over each player until you find the right name. By default, player names are not visible until you mouse over the character. Unknown if you can make this info display all the time.\n\nMagic seems overly complicated. Equip a magic pouch; install temporary spells in to said book.\n\nUsing the bank is functional but rather complicated. Find a chest; it has to be a special type of non-reward chest. Once you open it, it displays all items in it as well as what you are holding (weird), Select an item, then decide if you are placing it in the bank or removing it. Drag and drop would be a better system IMO.\n\nCollecting resources is slow and grindy. For example, equip an axe, click on a tree then wait for you inventory to fill up, no stacking at all in the game. Run to the bank (remember it's a chest), store your items, run back to the tree, repeat until you get bored with that, then go mining and do it all over again for rocks. Or, maybe you want to make a potion, go digging up sand, take it to a forge to convert it to a vial, never discovered how to actually get any further than the part. And keep in mind that initially whilst collecting resources there is a very high failure rate. Good thing about the fail rate is you don't need to take any action to try again, it just keeps collect until your inventory is full.\n\nChatting is almost impossible. At times, depending on how many people are playing, text will scroll too fast to be able to keep track of anything. So if you decide to ask a question in game because you are stuck on something, you may or may not get an answer because other players may not see your question or they may just not reply. Usually they do. It is possible to make a private chat section, but I found no way to add other players. Also by default, all text is displayed until you filter out unwanted sections.\n\nIf you like trying to figure out things like this via trial and error, waiting for things to happen, and grinding like there is no tomorrow then go ahead and try the game you might like it.\n\nYes, it is early access, so hopefully it will improve. But for me, I doubt I will play it much in its current state, but will check on it from time to time as it seems like it has potential!","September 10, 2015","false","2.5"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

The user of the potion gets a short, small stat boost, I believe only minutes long. They also get 30 minutes of 2x xp.

I've never even written a negative review because I really think people should just decide for themselves. I shouldn't of even played this game tbh, I should have just looked at the video and said, NO.\n\nBut I did, I was greeted with a tutorial, this game wasted no time, bam right off the bat you are grinding various things, grinding fishing, mining, smithing, you name it. There isn't even really any animation while grinding, no real text describing what you are doing. Just, fail fail fail you caught a fish! You click once and forget, I only caught two types of "fish" so it wasn't like animal crossing where you collect a whole bunch of stuff either, so you wait and wait to gather fish and slowly you skill goes up, so yeah not much fun.  So lets burn through this tutorial fast so I can see the "main game." nope you have to grind your smithing up to like 6 or something so click and wait click and wait.   I clearly did not enjoy this game, very old out dated graphics, with no animations, very little effort if any into music, nothing seems complex or enjoyable at this time, so I quit.\n\nNow I honestly do not understand why anyone would like this game, but if this sounds fun to you go ahead and play it! It's free so you can just try it out, But let me warn you don't talk trash about this game or you will just get banned for trolling or something.  Yep I already wrote my opinion about this game in the forums here, but it got deleted and I got banned, so I assume making a negative review here is the only way I can tell you about my experience with the game. so sad. Okay so according to them I am a toxic troll, well go look at the other reviews of this game, others who enjoy the game even said the mods ruin it for them.\n\nSummary: Extremely boring grind fest (game play didn't appeal to me) Horrible graphics with pretty much no animation, music sound whats that? I only wrote this cause my forum post got deleted.... so this was self inflicted.\n\nMow's overall opinion about this game: Utter trash.\n\nBut still if you want to play it, do so, cause it is free....

What other game can you do that with?\n\nAll in all, for a free game, that looks extremely simplistic, I was definitely taken back by the complexity that is currently in  the game.

Why? Because I can actually craft my own weapons and armor. Now you might be saying "Yeah you can do that in RSC too". Yeah, you can spend 20 hours leveling mining and smithing to a point where you can craft yourself weapons/armor that fits to your level, or you can just buy it with coins from merchants and players.\n\nThis is where the game separates itself from RSC: By relying more on individual skill and less on economy. You don't get gold drops from monsters, the only way you get gold is from quests and player markets. This means that you have to rely on actually leveling up your skills in order to better your character as a whole, which makes this game much more rewarding than RSC ever was. Also, since everything you could ever need is in the first town, its much easier to make your own items without having to walk across the entire map just to find a specific tool like RSC.\n\nThe only downsides so far:\nreCAPTCHA interrupts your gameplay every once in awhile, which gets a little obnoxious\nBank UI is poorly designed, and took some time to get used to\n\nOther than that, this game is truly free to play, unlike RS, where its "free to play to a point where you can't progress any farther without paying for membership", so I highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a new MMO to play that's similar to RSC without all the junk that comes with it.","August 18, 2015","true","38.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

Randomly, at any time while your character is gaining xp, you will get a captcha. If you don't answer the captcha within 3 minutes, you lose a point. At -5 points your character is autobanned for botting. The gameplay is very semiafkable other than this. I definitely do recommend this game to anyone who has the resolve to check the game every 2 and a half minutes, or anyone who is capable of staring at their inventory while it slowly fills up with fish and ore. This game is for you.\n\nI personally like to study or read stuff while my little dude is fishing or mining, and I can get very engrossed in these other activities and neglect to check the game for a few minues. I'm at -3 captcha points now, and likely will reach -5 by the end of the day. When that happens I guess I'll just be done with this game.

I would recommend this to anyone that enjoys RPG games, now it does take some time to get into the good part of the game but its worth it because once you do pass the tutorial you get put into a wonderful land filled with wonderful people. The community for this game is probably the least cancerous one of all the RPG games on steam.\nThis game also runs smoothly almost all the time, I use a mac and it runs without fail even when recording.\n\nI recommend this game and I gladly support and fund the devolpment of RPG MO.","May 31","true","47.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","5"

This is literally a "make your own destiny" kind of game.  You do whatever it is that you feel so inclined to do.  Want to make a fortune? Sure, go find the best way to do that and have fun. Want to level for no other reason than to level? Why not? Go for it. You can do whatever you want because you are not limited by much of anything.\n\nOne of the best things about this game is that they do not give players the option to pay to be better than everyone else.  You can pay to get better equipment faster and other special items, sure, but the best items in the game are IN THE GAME.  You are also able to purchase a double experience potion, which they did something very unique with. Once a person purchases said 2x Exp potion and then uses it, every single player gets double experience. If that doesn't excite you... Please, find another game.\n\nEDIT: For anyone who may be worried about the moderators, don't be. The moderators do their job very well. 9/10 of these negative reviews screaming about horrible mods I've actually witnessed the encounter and can say they all deserved what they got. Please avoid this game if you have authority issues and can't follow simple rules.","August 23, 2015","true","613.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

You might be reading a lot of negative reviews based on community or moderators.  I find this laughable.  Yes, the game has some up front rules about chat.  Most people don't read them.  The rules actually make the game community refreshing compared to what is common on the internet and in gaming today.  The chat also features an ignore tab just in case anyone strikes you as overly annoying.  Instead of using it, people often prefer to engage in juvenile arguments which often escallate to breaking the chat rules.  That all being said, I've ignored some folks and moved on in the game.  It's actually rather simple.\n\nThe game itself is quite expansive and has a player market that I feel enhances the experience.  One should note:  this is a grind game.  You will have to grind some skills hardcore to get places and currency to get the gear you need.  If grinding isn't your thing, you might think twice.  I've got several games I've purchased in the last 2 months and all of them are promising.  But I can't stop playing RPG MO.  I was even pretty slow at getting currency and good gear as I leveled, but there's always that next tier you want to reach.  I admit too that I find the retro graphics totally charming, maybe because I'm an older gamer.  Anyway, I highly recommend it, especially if you want to see time disappear.","October 21, 2015","true","215.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

This game bring back memory’s of playing RPG's on the NES for hours on end loosing all track of time. It has a in-depth crafting, breeding, farming and fishing system that in it self you could spend months on alone. I said it reminded me of RPG's on the NES but it is not a RPG, its a straight MMO grinder with no story. So if your looking for RPG elements or depth you wont find it here.\n\nIts still in beta but very far along and the developers are working consistently on it. There are a few things that might turn people off of it and that is that it is a extremely heavy grinding game in all areas including crafting. I personally like this type of game but not all will.\n\nAlso the chat is heavily moderated and in some chat channels like EN (the under 18 / PG / new player chat), there are rules that must be followed and most are not used to this type of moderation in a game. But the moderators are friendly and fair but do stick to the letter of the law (rules). There are other channels that are more laxly moderated. So if you do play this game take a few minutes to look over the rules as it will save some aggravation for you and everyone else.\n\nI like this game for what it is, a basic grinder with a friendly community to waste some hours on here and there. If grinding your life away is your style you might like it as well. Be warned though if you do start playing and have to be somewhere set a alarm because hours can pass before you know it.","October 17, 2015","true","592.6"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

I may be old, but I can still enjoy a game with the littlest of mechanics and basic features. With personal taste aside, RPG MO is covered in a nice coating of Nostalgia. With some of the worst graphics and lackluster gameplay, its simplicity and callback to older titles makes it a pure Gem. Although not recommended to indulge days of your life, it has a spot in my library for being a relaxing time waster and and overall enjoyable experience.

Which yes, is somewhat strange since swearing can be found in any online game. Don't even try using acronyms that somewhat imply a curse word, still counts as a bad word and can recieve mutes for 30-60 minutes if done up to three times or more.\n- Have to join the 18+ chat to have access to use acronyms that imply, or full spelling of swear words or anything that implies drugs. Also have to join 18+ chat to do anything above soft trolling, or type like an 8 year old even though it's 18+ chat.\n\n- There is no such thing as Local/World/Global chat yet. So yes, the chat is always clogged up even if you turn on filters. Might as well made seperate chat tabs for system notifications+game events, and player chat. Especially when you want to private message a friend because it's almost impossible to follow a private message conversation.\n\n- As of this current review, there are six worlds (Servers). They all basically share the same chat, so you can see whatever someone is saying if they are in world one even though you are in world six. They need a Local/World/Global chat soon, the chat is getting more and more cluttered and spammy the more players that play.\n\n- No guild system and even if there was, there isn't enough things that a guild can really do together really.\n\n- There is a captcha system in the game. You have to fill out the captcha whenever you are actively grinding a skill every once in a while. Missing or getting the captcha wrong at least five times (Or more depending on your captcha points.) can get you jailed in-game, or instead banned. This is a anti-botting system, it's fine since the captcha does give you bonus exp. Warning, the captcha can still appear in-game even if you go cook something on the stove or take a dump on the toilet. Happened to me once.\n(Maybe try telling the moderators that your eyes are bad and they'll let you off with some kind of alternative system for anti-botting.)\n\n- No animations or voice files for character, NPCs, or monsters. Suggest playing this game while doing other things so you can just play this game like an idle game. Like any other idle game, do other things while playing since you aren't really going to see much happening other than the feeling of progress.\n\n- Suggest if you're not going to do other things while playing, try playing your own music while muting the game. Helps to get your mind to feel better rather than just looking at a screen that isn't really changing other than scenery and the occasional watching someone die.\n\n- I don't reccomend this game if you're not going to, or try to put 168 or more hours into it. Game is very grindy once reaching Combat Level 35+, and you will need to spend a lot of time on other skills other than combat to make money for equipment, or either invest into skilling to make equipment. If you're too lazy to invest time to make your own equipment and items, it also takes time to make money to buy higher level equipment to kill those stronger monsters.\nGrindy game that does award you for doing it, but only play if you're into grindy games where it takes longer and longer to level up a skill the further you go into it. Suggest using $5 irl to buy a double exp potion.\n\n____\n\nRandom good stuff-:\n\nGood game to play while-\nWatching favorite Youtubers, watching streams on Twitch, playing other games while you afk grind on RPG MO (Checking back every 4-6 minutes to do anti-bot captcha.), watching TV, playing another afk grind game (lol), bored.\n\nRPG MO has a good amount of skill sets. Each of which either help you in combat in some way, or either helps you earn money to buy stuff to help you in combat.\n\nGame does not have a very large learning curve skill. The difference between a bad and good player is depends on if they have studied the Wiki and know how to do the various things this game offers, and also knows how combat stats work. Now all you have to do is pray to RNGsus. RNGsus is your friend once you have the equipment you want for your current level.\n\nCommunity is good, but currently mainly because there are many new players and most players combat levels 20+ are giving advice and giving them the ropes. Don't know how it will look later on, strict chat rules kind of ruins the fun for those of us who mainly see a chat box as a way of entertainment if you know what I mean. (Kind of cried when I got muted when I named Dark Shrooms, Dank Shrooms. There is even a quest that says to go out an find Dark Shrooms. Too bad can't get my profit selling my Shrooms.)\n\nSkills so far do make it feel like you are progressing slowly but surely into end game. The more time you invest into the game, the more godly you feel. Tfw when you make your first Iron Broadsword and feel like a badass walking around with it, especially once you hit your first 6-8 points of damage on an enemy. Or when a monster the exact same level as you deals zero damage every 2-3 turns (Yes, there is real time action turn based combat.).\n\nReal time action turn based combat, nostalgia for those oldschool RPGers. You can only run away from a fight three turns into a fight. Be wary of aggroing an aggressive monster that is stronger than you that can engage and lock you into combat.\n\n____\n\nThings I am waiting for:\n\nI don't know, but magic feels somewhat bland. Maybe it'd be nice to have a spell that has a long cooldown, but is able to stun the target to miss 1-2 turns. Although that might be a bit overpowered for PvP so I don't know.\n\nStill waiting for an archery combat system, although I don't know what it would exactly be like. Making you can engage combat two tiles away from a monster, and each tile the monster moves towards you counts as one turn? (You can't move when you engage combat, but you at least get 1-2 turns of free hits on enemy. Which can give an advantage in combat when you wear non-heavily armored equipment.)\n\nMake monsters be able to move around in a set distance. Such as maybe being able to wander a distance of 4-6 tiles away from their spawn point.

The game seems to be functional in its coding for drops, crafting, all that kinda crap.  But the main downside is that its not player friendly.  The tutorial is practically identical to RuneScape.  But the only thing youll learn is how to do each skill like fishing and so on.  So far there seems to be no NPC to sell off all your junk, you can only sell to some NPCs and the only sellable items are what they happen to be selling to you, so in other words you cant farm for money, you wil be deleting items in your inventory.  The main source for money seems to be selling items to players (who are also probably at the exact same financial level as you) so that means if youre not selling the best gear or the best materials then youre not selling a damn thing.\nThis game could be okay, just once the Devs begin to consider the idea of "players" being people and not NPCs.","August 18, 2015","false","4.0"," 12 of 25 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","12","25","0","0"

No Interaction Between Multiple Accounts.\n\nAlthough you are allowed to have multiple accounts (A maximum of FIVE), and are allowed to have more than one account training at one time, you may not use secondary "slave" accounts to gather resources to give to a "primary" account for skill training. This also includes using accounts for storage space, and selling the resources gathered on one account to gain money on another. Any accounts that are found to be interacting with each other who have the same owner will be permanently jailed and banned. "\n\nThis is inane. Other than to make an acct for just PVP or something, there wouldn't be much use for 5 accounts in game in a game with theoretically three builds: mage, warrior, hybrid. Furthermore, no using accounts as extra storage is extremely discouraging- working to actively handicap the player from stockpiling resources and making money by giving them that little invo space may keep you in control of the market, but at the cost of making money a chore and forcing you to "play favorites" with your invo and trashing perfectly fine items. I also can't think of many MMOs that outright ban "trading across the same IP" meaning people (like those complaining in the forums for this game) can't trade with their family members or friends if they are playing LAN. It's ridiculous. Look at the forums, you have these people desperate to like the game but are being put off cause they can't do ♥♥♥♥ with their girlfriends or younger brothers.\n\n"Although the majority of the newly added content to the game is bug free, sometimes the developers miss bugs that can be abused by players. The use of any bugs for your own personal benefit is against the rules because it gives you an unfair advantage over the rest of the community."\n\nThe devs here have a lot of nerve pushing the blame of exploiting bugs onto the player themselves rather than their own oversight. Exploit of bugs doesn't give you unfair advantage over the rest of the community if those very bugs are theoretically accessible to the entire community. The bugs are you problem, not ours. These are mechanics discovered within the confines of the game, with no third party involved. You should either be more lenient or just patch and thank the damn players for calling attention to the exploits. Why would players go out of their way to test out exploits in an open beta if they could be punished? Why would you even punish them if you are not losing money? If a certain exploit was good enough to invalidate paid content, I would think it would come to the community's attention really fast. Instead of banning people, patch the stuff. The game is in EARLY ACCESS, how counterintuitive is it to ban for exploiting bugs in an open beta?\n\nThis is bannable according to MO devs:\n\n"Trading accounts with another person"\n\nWhy is this not allowed? What if I got sick of the terrible rules and my friend wanted to start playing so I let them pick up mine? Would that count? The rules, despite being so draconian, are also extremely vague.\n\nAvoid.","April 29","false","3.1"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","4"

Dragon Warrior-(NES), Telengard – (Atari 800XL), and of course the vaunted Ultima series from the original pc days all comes to mind when playing RPG MO.  The magic these games held was partially due to the love of the, “Grind”. That love has been neatly re-created in this polished offering from the RPG MO team.\n\nThe love and care the Dev team along with the staff has put into this offering can clearly be seen from the moment a new player steps into the tutorial. A deep crafting system along with applicable time sinks to farm materials makes for endless hours of enjoyable reminiscence. This has taken many aspects of the past and improved them to fit for today’s discerning gamer!\n\nThis game is well worth a look for just the community alone. The staff and players are both informative and well behaved. I don’t have to tell you just how rare that is these days…\n\nThe verdict!\n\nIf you are a fan of fast paced instant gratification with no community save the smell of your own stench, stay away! This game in many aspects will not speak to you.\n\nIf you are a fan of retro gaming, a helpful and friendly community along with the beauty of a smoldering slow satisfying grind, then welcome my friend!\n\nHands down this is a title that is welcome and I am glad I have the chance to play it!\n","August 20, 2015","true","66.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I'm just barely old enough to have played the old Runescape and this is very reminiscent of that. If you look at this and think "What the heck, there aren't even movement animations!" then this probably isn't the game for you. If you still want to see what the buzz is about, feel free to download it. It is free after all.\n\nThe UI is a bit clunky, the graphics are minimal, the skills are basic, the combat is just two people standing still with numbers appearing over their heads, and it's brilliant. Most of the skills are just you standing there while your inventory fills up, so it's great for playing while you're watching TV/YouTube/Twitch or whatever else you like to do. I've heard people say the music is repetitive. I think it's great, but I never really pay that much attention to background music so I'll leave that up to the individual. All in all, the game is incredibly charming, but it's not for everyone.","August 20, 2015","true","97.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Its only real selling point is that you can play it on any computer/phone with a very unstable connection.\n\nThe game requires zero skill. You click something, and then combat just takes place. You can't affect the outcome of combat at all, outside of the double-hit trick and running away and healing. This reduces the game to a pure grind game. Just with a super low skill-ceiling.\n\nI will also commend the developers for making the shop not-P2W. The gear that you can craft/farm are comparable to the gear that you can buy in the shop.\n\nIf you're looking for a pure time sink game that doesn't challenge you in any way, then this might be the right game for you.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the game's moderators are super sensitive. Its like coming to a small town and talking to someone at the local bar: Everyone assumes you're up to no good, and if you question someone's conclusions, then everybody gangs up on you.\nI recieved a silence for what I would call a pretty standard discussion. You can be the judge of that yourself. Chat logs are here (edited by the mod of course): http://forums.mo.ee/viewtopic.php?p=18767#p18767\n\nHowever. Being a free game.

So if you don't enjoy games where you grind experience, levels, and loot for hours to power up your character then just stop reading now because you most likely will not have fun with this game.\n\nIf you do enjoy those things, then RPGMO is a game that is quite good. Entering the world there is so much to do, and most of it is really well executed to fit the style of a classic Runescape kind of feeling to it. The game is really fun for someone who enjoys these kinds of games, and that is my honest opinion about it.\n\nThe thing you should not expect from this game however is any sort of fun involvement in the community. In my experience that I am sharing of this game, the chat is so heavily moderated by the guys in green text that it feels as if the moderators will remove things from chat or ban usernames just because they feel like it. There are also rules in this game such as no bad words that make interaction with others so limited and boring that instead of giving my full attention to this game, it tends to be something I play on the side with another game.\n\nThere have been several instances where I have logged in and literally just said hello to people and gotten some sort of complaining from moderators. In fact one even made me change my name (which is semi-understandable).\n\nIn summary: yes RPGMO is a great game for its genre in my opinion, but I cannot promise you a great community experience.\n\n7.5/10 as a game\n1/10 regarding anything social. The 1 is there just because the game has global chat capabilities across worlds.","March 21","true","39.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The reason why I left was because of the community there. I was attacked for pretty much no reason when I was discussing how this game is like to other MMOs (did not name any games since that wasn't allowed). There were mods there but they really didn't do ANYTHING, which is funny, because they told me to take it to another channel else when I mentioned "cards against humanity" but did nothing when I was attacked. And yes, mods are pretty much abusive (at least the majority of them). There are one or two nice mods but they're on where there's not a lot of people on (3am-6am pst).\n\nThe game itself is very clunky. Yes, it's  grind and click fest. Nothing special. You know, for a game that's been out for 4 years+. It's extremely extremely basic with power abusive mods.\nAlso, if you are one of those talkative people on chat, just be very very careful. You WILL get attack if you even badmouth the game (comparing it to other is also considered that) and there will be whiteknights coming out of the woods work, don't forget the biased mods.\nyou can find a lot more details if you read the other negatives (the mods in the game actually tell you the negative reviews are trolls). Frankly, aside from the mods, it's hilarious that the GMs put out those incredibly stupid rules. They don't want you to talk about other games and will tell you to get into a (dead) channel that no one uses. I guess they're afraid to look bad if someone compared their games to other games.\n\n\nFunny thing is, they said that the game is " created with adult gamers in mind" but their community and rules along with mods contradict that.\n\nThe game is fun for a while. if you do give it a try. Just keep the mods in mind, and because of how small the players base is, you will see those that literally spam the chat with their useless talk (yes, mods do that too). Think of attention hoarders. So if one of the mod dislike you, most likely they will ALL dislike you. So tread carefully.\nThe market is pretty useless, since of how small the player base is, it's not even worth it to list low level items, people do buy SOME low mats but nope, unless you have high level equips/items then don't even bother.\n\nTheir capchat system is extremely annoying. It literally pop up every 5 to 15 min if your char is doing something. I understand they do that to prevent bots, but uhh really, for a game with this small players based, don't think their main concern should be bots (at least not overly compulsive like).","April 8","false","25.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

RPG MO reminds me of my childhood locked inside playing RuneScape Classic on my dad's PC, and that nostalgia isn't the only reason I'm loving RPG MO. The game has simplistic graphics, certainly, (if the sprites were animated, it would look much better IMO) but the feeling of playing a truly open world MMO where you can create your own goals, chat with the other extremely friendly players, and craft any usable item is wonderful. RPG MO beats every AAA mmo I've played for two reasons: 1) Truly open ended gameplay, and 2) it's got soul. I would recommend this game even if it wasn't free.\n\nBut anyways, I'm going to shut up and go play this game some MO (get it??).","March 4","true","3.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Kept leveling mining like mad until someone mentioned that leveling defense and magic was the most powerful (but expedience) way to do damage. So using the experience buff to my advantage I made an alt and started to train defense and magic. Then midnight came. God were I happy. 24 hours of double experience gain was a heaven sent gift I didn't know I wanted. Kept playing until five in the morning, slept for two hours and then started playing again.\n\nThis time I made a new alt, this time focusing on power alone. The amount of damage was ridiculous so I kept leveling this alt instead. Figuring that I needed food for easier health regeneration I started fishing and cooking. Started out this alt with no skills leveled like the other two I began fishing with a fishing pole, went with a fishing net once I hit level 5, changed again when I hit level 35 for a fishing cage. My is fishing easy to level up with experience buff. Before I knew it I hit level 50 and went for a wooden harpoon. Played for another four hours before I needed proper sleep.\n\nTwo days later as I'm writing this I'm testing my limits by using yet another alt that is leveled up equally in all the combat stats (magic excluded) which I've heard isn't the best way to level, but I don't care, I do what I want. This alt is also still on the tutorial island smacking at rats farming for Quest Repeat Permissions.\n\nTL;DR: I like this game and *captcha*","January 3","true","83.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I'm very patient and decided I was straight up wasting my time after 6 straight hours. Those hours feel like they disappeared really fast.\n\n-Grindfest, timesink, and nothing else. This game is excellent for anyone who likes grinding and being mindless. This game IS grinding.\n\n-The market is kinda fun but that's about it. I enjoyed selling materials to get some good starter items but.. meh.\n\n-There isn't really any combat that takes place unless you consider trading a single attack with enemies until you or they die to be fighting. There are no abilities or mechanics. It's click and wait just like everything else.\n\n-I played to level 30 and couldn't figure out how to make anything more than the tutorial items. Maybe I missed something. This wasn't a big deal as I wouldn't waste a minute crafting. The system, UI, and inventory already deterred me from that.\n\n-Inventory space is a big problem. Materials do not stack so after 10 minutes of AFK farming a node you get to run back to the bank to unload/sell. Items need to stack at least somewhat.\n\n-Collecting materials would be an idle task if it weren't for their awful bot-prevention system. You get captchas randomly and if you miss 5 in a row, you get permabanned so you can't just afk while you collect resources slower than mollasses. Most of your experience collecting is resources is watching "You failed..." messages roll up your chat box.\n\n-Completing the captchas gives you a point that you can allocate to any of your skills. If you miss a captcha, you've essentially missed out on 2 of these points. This is the first and last time I play a game that shoves captchas in my face.\n\nAlso, I wouldn't exactly look to this game for immersion but popping up a captcha is an easy way to break it. You're playing a fantasy game and then suddenly your looking at a picture of a house number. Apparently they're so afraid of botters that they're willing to do this. A bot would be better off playing this game anyway since players basically replicate one.\n\n1/10 Stay away.","February 28","false","12.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KineseN/recommended/372800/","KineseN","KineseN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KineseN/","94 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo I figured I wanted to play a new game for the new year and chose RPG MO since it reminded me so much of Ultima Online, Runscape and Tibia.\n\nStarted out with the tutorial in the morning December 31 with a 15 minutes 2x experience buff and got to combat level 12 with accuracy and health fighting rats and dummies (the only enemies on tutorial island), leveled my fishing to level 10, got myself a full set of bronze armor set (leveling both mining and forging to 20), ended the tutorial and went to work.\n\nGot home again and leveled my mining some more and got hit by another 30 minutes of 2x experience buff. Kept leveling mining like mad until someone mentioned that leveling defense and magic was the most powerful (but expedience) way to do damage. So using the experience buff to my advantage I made an alt and started to train defense and magic. Then midnight came. God were I happy. 24 hours of double experience gain was a heaven sent gift I didn't know I wanted. Kept playing until five in the morning, slept for two hours and then started playing again.\n\nThis time I made a new alt, this time focusing on power alone. The amount of damage was ridiculous so I kept leveling this alt instead. Figuring that I needed food for easier health regeneration I started fishing and cooking. Started out this alt with no skills leveled like the other two I began fishing with a fishing pole, went with a fishing net once I hit level 5, changed again when I hit level 35 for a fishing cage. My is fishing easy to level up with experience buff. Before I knew it I hit level 50 and went for a wooden harpoon. Played for another four hours before I needed proper sleep.\n\nTwo days later as I'm writing this I'm testing my limits by using yet another alt that is leveled up equally in all the combat stats (magic excluded) which I've heard isn't the best way to level, but I don't care, I do what I want. This alt is also still on the tutorial island smacking at rats farming for Quest Repeat Permissions.\n\nTL;DR: I like this game and *captcha*","January 3","true","83.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sort of like how when your character fights something, they would go side by side with the enemy and have some animated battles, sort of like the 8-bit games.

Good time waster.\n\nCommunity is pretty good. Questions usually get an answer in the EN chat. Just remember that a large amount of questions can be answered using the in-game wiki - Learn how to use it and it'll help a lot.\n\n\nMain reason I'm writing this is because I'm a little annoyed about the most common complaint - Mods.\nEN (One of the default chats) chat has strict rules - No swearing, and no discussing other games. So people get muted(and eventually banned) there. I haven't seen the mods even mute someone before giving at least one warning.\n\nThe ST chat (one of the steam default chats, though any player can access it AFAIK) doesn't have those rules. No spamming is basically the only one there.\n\n\nNot really pay to win. You can get equipment faster with money, but at most levels (including the top levels) there is a non-purchasable item that's the same (usually 2-3 stat points higher) anyways. And you need to earn the levels to use the equipment anyways. Most of the premium stuff is sold on the player market as well.\nThe most common purchase is a double XP potion. When someone drinks one, the double xp applies to everyone (on all servers). There are some temporary stat boosts for the user only.","November 5, 2015","true","666.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Atleast, at first. After playing for some time and learning about the game I found it to be quite lacking sadly.\n\nWhile the game does boast multiple skills that are reminiscent of runescape/UO, its execution is quite lacking. Typically one of the most iconic skills from UO is the taming system... This has none. Instead it has Breeding, which is a neat concept, except for the fact that pets feel more like equipment rather than, well, pets. I can't train my pet, but I can mate him and get a good mix that I can use and/or sell off, it actually reminded me of a game called Chicken Jockey where you bred and raised chickens to sell..\n\nThe death system is similar to runescapes in that you keep 2 most valuable items, but in this game, the rest of your items are destroyed. Furthermore the value is based on poorly listed prices in game, so an item that could take you 5 hours of real grinding, is worth peanuts compared to something simple you can buy off an npc in the starter town, causing you to have a panic attack should you happen to almost die.\n\nThe game does stop bots by incorporating a captcha system, however the mods go over the top by also banning those who trade between accounts on the same IP. Sorry brothers and sisters, dads/moms and sons/daughters, helping out each other is punishable by losing all your accounts tied to your home should you choose to help each other out.\n\nIts further laughable that the game makes the point to compare themselves to runescape and UO in the very description of the game on the store page, but don't you dare mention those games, or any others for that matter, in chat unless you like being yelled at by a mod for "advertising other games".... Seriously? You listed them in your bloody description, why point out your game is similar to these others and then stop people from talking about the similarities?\n\nIf the furer's secret police don't daunt your spirit from liking this game, the unbelievable grind will. The skills are hardly balanced out, some increasing so quickly in exp that you would expect to become a master in mere days from focusing on, while others are so horrendously slow you want to punt a rabbit across a football field *cough, woodchopping, cough*\n\nThe monsters all seem to be static, glued in place like pieces on a chestboard, always spawning back in the exact same square they appeared before, and their loot seems to be wildly unbalanced as the drop rates are set horrendously low for the most oddest of items. You need 6 dorpat souls to make a potion that teleports you to the starter town... With a drop rate of 0.25% from all mobs found on that map. How very rare... Oh, or heres a teleport to dorpat scroll on this merchant npc in town for a mere 1k gold.\n\nNo archery? Oh no! Wait... Magic! Yay.....Oh... Its not ranged? Of course not, the monsters can't move, so being a mage is pretty much... I'm sorry, whats the point? I mean seriously? Having to use magic as if its a sword is just.. Ugh, don't get me started on that, just don't.\n\nAlot of things need to change and be added for this to even touch either of those titles mentioned in its description, if anything","March 15","false","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The repetition and grindy aspect of this game is more of a pro instead of a con as it causes the player to try and spend time to gain the materials necessary to make new equipment and grow in specific stats making the player feel like they're slowly progressing and once they look back to where they were in the beggining of the game, it will give the player a feeling of accomplishment and satisfaction. Now I do feel like the repitition and grindy aspects of the game could be worked on and done better as I have played games that do this MUCH better than RPG MO does (for example, the monster hunter series, which if you haven't heard of that series and you have a psvita or 3ds, I highly reccomend you check out that series, the endgame is grindy as hell but in a fun way and trying to solo the endgame is like playing darksouls with all of your fingers being frozen in some kind of cryogenic liquid), but I'm not going to try and list all of the ways it could improve because I'm just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who's still in highschool so I could just be making a fool of myself.\nso in the end, this game targets a specific group of people which I'm glad to fall under, so don't rush to say that specific parts of games are faults but instead consider how well that part of the game was done instead of wether or not it fits your tastes of videogames as that could drive away people who actually enjoy these kinds of games such as myself.","April 17","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've played it more on my Chromebook browser. Anyhow I will recommend this title. Though this game is not for everyone, it's got a multitude of activities to do besides combat. Unlike in some other free-to-play MMOs. Though these activites aren't very interactive. Fishing for example; a popular thing people in this game do is cook and sell fish for money. You fish by equiping your fishing rod and walking up to a fishing hole. Then, you wait for your inventory to be filled with fish, and walk away. Eventually your fishing skill will increase, and you'll be able to catch more expensive fish. So, yes, this game is a grindfest. But, due to the areas you can visit. The rewarding level system, and many options with those activities; it feels like you're doing more then grinding most of the time. There are many skills to learn and upgrade in this game, such as mining, farming, breeding, etc. They level up the more you do them, and every now and then, a point is rewarded to you, and you may give it to what ever stat you like. A combo that works suprisingly well, as both tend to feel rewarding. The music in this game is exellent, and feels medieval. The graphics are lovely, if you're in to 2D retro graphics. The game's main flaw, is how it gets boring after you get to high leveled. Though thanks to the many play styles you can take, it has some replay ability. There's more stuff to this game I did not touch on. Such as player housing, and the player market. But, I want you to discover the rest of the game for yourself. If you deside it's your cup of tea.","February 19","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you do not, turn back now!\n\nPros:\n-Quick tutorial that teaches you enough to get you interested\n-Good variety of skills very remniscent of Runescape Classic\n-Grinding feels rewarding and exp rates are quite good\n-Expansive world and varying creatures\n\nCons:\n-Awkward movement that will slow you down for the wrong reasons\n-Extremely limited character customization\n-Clunky UI\n\nIf you can get past these negatives, RPG MO is a fun throwback to oldschool mmo's with well paced progression. I'd imagine it gets more hardcore the longer you play, but it can be a fun casual experience for those looking to play for a few hours at a time.

It's grindy, yes, but not too grindy (although be prepared to constantly be running back to town to grab more food in the first few kill quests of the game, as if you haven't picked up enough armour or defense stats, the enemies will do you for quite a bit of damage). Progression in gathering skills mainly involves clicking on a rock or a tree or something while having the appropriate gathering tool equipped, then waiting until your inventory is full with whatever you're collecting. It's a nice, casual game to play if you don't feel like doing much. Highly recommend.","April 6","true","3.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You have to spend time playing the game game and using these skills in order for them to go up.  Want to be better at mining? Then mine, mine, mine.\n\nThere are a lot of different skills (Farming, Fishing, Cooking, Alchemy, Breeding, Mining, Jewelry, Carpentry, Forging, and Woodcutting.  There is no skill cap on any of these, just be prepared for the need to grind away at them to have them continue in going up.  You can make some amazing items just from farming the mats and practicing.  I actually made my own bronze armor/weapons as a lower lvl character just by spending some time mining, forging and smithing before I ran out and started killing things.\n\nThe gathering skills also provide you with the opportunity to earn money by selling them on the market to players who would rather pay for them vs gathering them on their own.  I made 60k pretty quickly selling sand and purchased my pet day 1.\n\nThere is a wide varity of pets which helps to increase your inventory size as well as adding some stats to your character.  They are limited in use by your stats/level so make sure you can use one before spending money on them.\n\nDeath happens.... In this game when you die you keep 2 items (based on their vendor value) and your pet.  The rest dissapear forever.  thankfully you shouldnt die unless you just aren't paying attention or you try to tackle something way beyond your means.  There is a potion (rare drop or ingame purchase) that you can buy which will protect 5 more items for those who feel the need.  Over all death isn't something one should fear after they quickly learn how to avoid it.\n\nThe community is a great one also.  Most will share their wisdom and will come help you if you got trapped by some high level monsters while farming goods.\n\nThe game has a captcha feature pops up occasionally.  enter the correct code and get 1 point which can be spent for exp on any skill or stat.  Get it wrong no point.  Don't answer it in 180 seconds and you get a - point.  Get 5 of those and you get jailed.  This is done to help prevent botting / farming.  It has a built in system to reward you for being there and for punishing those who would use it just to farm for other accounts.\n\nThe game has a built in currency (MOS) and store which isn't a bad system.  It doesn't feel like a pay to win game.  The items are helpful but not needed.  Most things can be gotten through the market and in game gold.  The only major item in the MOS store is the 2x exp potions which gives everyone on the server 30 mins bonus experience on all skills used during that time.\n\nOverall the game is fun.  I have 2 monitors and watch movies on one screen and paly on the other.  You can also play on your phone or any tablet/ipad (which makes work playing possible too).\n\n\nI would say give this game a go and tell your friends :)\n\nIf you have more questions check out my video series I've done and post comments on things you want me to video about the game also.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inAaYa-EA44","August 23, 2015","true","54.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Players may move using WASD, the arrow keys, or with the click of their mouse along a diagonal grid; the game's world.  Though the game is in  its infant stage, the crafting system and skills are quite in-depth, however, its combat skills are lukewarm at best, for now.\n\nDETAILED ANALYSIS:\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nTutorial:\n\nIt is important to know that the doorways on Tutorial Island are a one-way trip, so it would be wise to learn what each room has to teach before advancing; although you can still find the skill trainers in the starting town.  Each trainer teaches you the basics of combat, mining, woodcutting, fishing, forging, jewelry, cooking, and alchemy.\n\nCombat:\n\nRPG MO's combat system is currently its Achilles heel.  To engage in combat, for a first strike, players must maneuver their characters as though they are trying to move on the exact space their target is positioned on (monsters do not move); however, moving to a space adjacent to an aggressive monster will also initiate combat but with the monster dealing the first strike.  Once combat is initiated, players cannot run until at least three attacks are exchanged.  While there is a plethora of various weapon types, the only difference between them is the amount of accuracy and strength they add, as well as their handedness; there is absolutely no difference in attack speed between any weapon or combat style.\n\nGathering/Crafting:\n\nThere are 4 gathering skills and 6 crafting skills, most of which can be done while AFK; however, you still need to keep one eye glued to the game screen to prevent the possibility of being AFK jailed via captcha.  Most gathering skills will help for gathering their respective loot faster as they level, so a higher mining level yields quicker mining.  Similarly, crafting skills also yield more loot as they level but instead by reducing the failure chances, at least on most of them.\n\nLoot:\n\nLoot from monsters is received in a randomly assorted fashion; each monster can drop, into your inventory, its own list of loot at different drop rates; these can be found by right-clicking a monster and left-clicking "(monster name) drops".\n\nCONTROLS:\nAll basic controls are performed with WASD or arrow keys for movement, left-click to move or confirm options, and right-click to open additional options for individual objects/characters.  There is an option to re-map controls and menu short-cuts for a more personalized set-up.\n\nGRAPHICS:\nDue to the absence of character animations and presence of low graphic images, RPG MO is playable on many of the lower spec. computers.\n\nOVERALL OPINION:\nRPG MO still has some kinks to work out, but it is still a decent game to play to kill some time.","September 18, 2015","true","49.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

If you are working on a computer and dont have time to play something else this game could run in the background. There is an anti-bot mechanism which demands you to enter captchas but the devs were kind enough to implement a system notification that pops-up from time to time telling you to enter the captcha. Oh and I found the captchas to even be usefull for me, they prompt me to make breaks in my work since I could often work so hard that I forget to take breaks.\nIf you play this game actively, than it is something like a chat with a game in the background. The people are most often friendly since the game is not very PvP oriented, you do not have to fear any ganking or getting killed by a pro just for the lulz.\nYeah one more thing DO NOT discuss other games in the EN (global) chat, the moderators really hate it and it can get you banned. But aside from that almost everything off-topic  is allowed in the chat, I have seen a discussion about reallife job interviews, real life pets, car accidents, weather, ...... anything.","February 19","true","43.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

In all the hours ive played it havent found any bugs sofar. It plays like the old old school runescape and if you like that than you would like this as well. Its a grinding game and its not hard to lvl up at all until you get into the 75+ range and my fishing atm is 80 and going from 80-81 is about 200k ish exp. There is no lvl cap on any skills so if you really like something you can go as far as you want with it. I really cant find anything bad to say about it, its a good early stage game that you can play when you just want to realx or something. Also all the server markets are connected and all 2x exp is for all servers when one happens so if a server ever goes down or anything just hop worlds and keep playing like nothing change.

There's an active mod and dev team, and a pretty good community. I can see myself playing this game for many months to come.","September 6, 2015","true","126.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was skeptical of the positive reviews, and decided to see for myself; What did I have to lose? RPG MO would not be the first Runescape-like browser MMO, there's also RPG Reborn, and a couple others I cannot name off the top of my head, one of them being for Macs specifically. I've been on a long search for an MMO that could hope to capture what was so awesome about Runescape, while taking out some of the tedium. RPG MO is a 2d isometric MMORPG that has, as of this writing, 15 skills that you can level without limit; That's right, NO level cap! The world looks very nice, the community is pretty casual and laid back, and for those who knew Runescape's community long back, they would know how toxic it was. RPG MO has one of the more friendlier communities I've seen. RPG MO is free to play, and I should say that it does actually offer a shop for you to buy "MOS" with real money or Steam Wallet cash. Note this however: To my knowledge, anything you can get there, you can also craft. RPG MO is the furthest a browser MMO with a real currency shop can get from pay to win, as it forces you to still do the work to get anywhere, and in the end your work is the deciding factor of progress in the game, not MOS.\n\n\n\nOn the particular day I started playing, which is the day I am writing this review, people were chipping in double XP potions, which aren't exactly cheap to get, from the currency shop. When one person uses such a potion, EVERYONE gets double XP for the duration of the potion (30 minutes per potion?) This makes leveling skills notably much faster, for everybody, and people always give thanks for the double XP. I feel this shows how connected the community is, as a lot of things on that store are less than those potions and can serve you personally much better, yet they chose something that would benefit everyone involved.\n\n\nI decided that this was a game and community I wanted to be a part of, and following the Double XP spree (which was 2+ hours), I added in a few of my own before taking my leave to write this review. Play this game, try it and see for yourself. It's fun, skill grinding won't utterly kill your interest as it's pretty fair overall... and remember to thank those who give 2x experience!","August 31, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I was skeptical of the positive reviews, and decided to see for myself; What did I have to lose? RPG MO would not be the first Runescape-like browser MMO, there's also RPG Reborn, and a couple others I cannot name off the top of my head, one of them being for Macs specifically. I've been on a long search for an MMO that could hope to capture what was so awesome about Runescape, while taking out some of the tedium. RPG MO is a 2d isometric MMORPG that has, as of this writing, 15 skills that you can level without limit; That's right, NO level cap! The world looks very nice, the community is pretty casual and laid back, and for those who knew Runescape's community long back, they would know how toxic it was. RPG MO has one of the more friendlier communities I've seen. RPG MO is free to play, and I should say that it does actually offer a shop for you to buy "MOS" with real money or Steam Wallet cash. Note this however: To my knowledge, anything you can get there, you can also craft. RPG MO is the furthest a browser MMO with a real currency shop can get from pay to win, as it forces you to still do the work to get anywhere, and in the end your work is the deciding factor of progress in the game, not MOS.\n\n\n\nOn the particular day I started playing, which is the day I am writing this review, people were chipping in double XP potions, which aren't exactly cheap to get, from the currency shop. When one person uses such a potion, EVERYONE gets double XP for the duration of the potion (30 minutes per potion?) This makes leveling skills notably much faster, for everybody, and people always give thanks for the double XP. I feel this shows how connected the community is, as a lot of things on that store are less than those potions and can serve you personally much better, yet they chose something that would benefit everyone involved.\n\n\nI decided that this was a game and community I wanted to be a part of, and following the Double XP spree (which was 2+ hours), I added in a few of my own before taking my leave to write this review. Play this game, try it and see for yourself. It's fun, skill grinding won't utterly kill your interest as it's pretty fair overall... and remember to thank those who give 2x experience!","August 31, 2015","true","8.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If you can get past the clunky interface and the lacking visuals then you are in for a wild ride. From the beginning you have a nice tutorial to teach you about the game. It goes through all the basics. After that you are put into the world with a single starting quest of killing chicken. This is where the game opens up to you.\n\nYou can do anything at this point. Want to be a fisher? Go ahead! Want to become a fierce warrior who is feared throughout all the world? Good luck! Want to simply make jewelry and other useful items? You bet your ♥♥♥ you can do that.\n\nThe game offers so many appealing choices. No one is forced into anything. You can be killing monsters one moment then fishing for fish the next. This is truly a sandbox MMO.\n\nThat's not even the best part of the game. The small community the game has gathered is AMAZING. Everyone is helpful and the mods are quick to help anyone in need. You can have some fun conversations with people and even make some friends.\n\nIn conclusion, if you can get over the games clunky interface and lack of visuals then this will be a memorable experience for you. This gets a 9/10 for me. It will be a 10/10 when they add some animations and stuff >:)","August 26, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

It's great if you prefer gameplay over graphics. The tutorial is very informative and lets you go at your own pace. You can also earn MOS (real money bought currency) while playing quests and logging in everyday and most of the things you can pay for with real money are on the in game market so this game places a big gap between f2p and pay to win and lets you enjoy the game without a disadvantage. You might not get to level 120+ in every skill, but you will most likely get pretty far. The game has an antibot system in place with captchas, which give you xp if you type them out, that give you a -1 for every time you miss it (not hard to miss them) and when you hit -5 you are jailed so the game is a fair game. The community is a friendly one and moderators will help and prevent spam at an impressive rate. If you like gameplay and like rpgs (or if you don't like rpgs it's still a good game) that have a ton of things to do then this is for you and anyone else for that matter.","September 25, 2015","true","7.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

Only without MANY of the conveniences of Runescape. Things that should be changed:\n-Withdraw/Deposit/Sell "x" of things\n-Forging that isn't a complete and total chore (the recipes are completely unnecessary busywork, and making exorbitantly high failure rates does nothing but increase your grind for no good reason)\n-Creatures that actually move.\n-Better click-detection, I often find myself clicking on things more than once to register an action.\n-Better inventory management (I always find myself wanting to move things around to better suit whatever I'm doing)\n-More music (it gets repetitive really fast)\n-Monsters should drop things more often than <10% of the time, and more than 1% of those drops should be not-crap\n-Quests that aren't literally "kill x of thing" (literally every "quest" is just that. kill x of a thing)\n-Do away with the random captchas (I understand it's highly effective bot-deterrent. I am not saying "Remove it NOW" I'm saying, when there's a better method that isn't so intrustive, please remove it, though it is nice to receive rewards for proving I am human at random times). Perhaps make it so that it appears less often the more times it is successfully completed?\n-The ability to heal in a fight, or at least retreat when I want. If I get into an unwanted fight from bad click detection, i should be able to back out immediately, not click my character away just to see them teleport back to the side of the unwanted monster just to get hit again.\n\nThe thing is, I don't hate the game. I like it. I would just like to like it more in the future.

Its charming simplicity and freedom makes RPG MO definitely a game I'd recommend.\n\nPros:\n+Absolute freedom\n+Pretty nice community\n+Easy to pick up\n+Good time killer\n\n+/- Small community\n\nCons:\n-Quite slow. Takes a while to level and do things efficiently.\n-Graphics may be unappealing to some.\n\nWhen I said "Absolute freedom" as one of the pros, I seriously mean it. You wanna go dig some sand? Go dig some sand. You wanna get rich merching? Get rich merching. You wanna murder angels? That's kinda messed up, but I mean you can do that too.\nI absolutely think that this freedom is what makes this game so appealing. The only thing restricting you is money and levels, which are do-able. No level-restricted areas, no "riveting endgame that's the only reason why you'd play a game," no P2W.\n\nNow get out there, and go fail to dig some sand!","September 7, 2015","true","5.2"," 13 of 30 people (43%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","43","13","30","28","0"

Realized quickly that this game has absolutely nothing even remotely close to being like UO.\n\nI would normally recommend this game as it's F2P, but it's got some astonishing flaws for a game that has been in development for 3 years. As for some of the things I liked. Gathering actually holds value in this game even at the very beginning which helps boost you up to being able to do more things quicker. There's a decent anti-bot system in place. The tutorial did not explain much which thankfully there is a built-in wiki that will constantly be holding your hand through majority of the first few hours.\n\nAs for the flaws. The game is built on an isometric map with 8-bit sprites that aren't animated whatsoever. Combat is clunky and all based on RNG. First few hours you'll be constantly in the wiki learning the basics of the game, which the game has a tutorial it just skips over the most important part of the ENTIRE crafting aspect. The game is free but has an item shop built purely for people to get mid-to-late game gear with just a few dollars. There's also packages that give you a large amount of coins, housing material, rare pets, etc. After seeing the item shop I checked out how often the game is updated and it's not surprising that they spread out updates several months in between.\n\n\nTL:DR It's an old school RS clone with a crafting system similar to Minecraft with the added breeding of animals and the ability to purchase your own island and build on it. Fair warning it's a F2P so be weary that it's extremely pay to win. If that sounds appealing feel free to go nuts you'll probably spend 10-20 hours before uninstalling.","August 18, 2015","false","40.7"," 11 of 28 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","11","28","3","7"

I'm an old Runescape player, and man oh man is this game garbage. There's no animations for ♥♥♥♥ing ANYTHING. You just glide across the ground and stand there to "attack" The ♥♥♥♥ kinda ♥♥♥♥ is that? I've played loads of 8Bit games, and THEY have animations when you walk, and attack, etc. This game? Just trash. Didn't play it long due to the fact I'm not playing a game that's basically Runescape without animations for anything, and agonizingly annoying music. Everyone just glides across the ground, and stands infront of enemies as they take damage and fall to their deaths of nothingness. The fact this ♥♥♥♥ has good reviews is a joke. Go play Runescape, because at least it has decent animations with some good content. This game... I just.. I can't even express how disappointed i was with this ♥♥♥♥♥.

Turns out, your character is your login name, I cant log in because i dont remember my character's name.  I remember my old characters name because thats what I had wanted it to be.  If you play, make sure your name is "appropriate" or you will have to change it, and if you do change it make sure to write it down or something...
