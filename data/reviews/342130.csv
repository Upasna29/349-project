Something even the thousand maggots could not do.\n\nIn its current state I would say to avoid the title entirely, hopefully in the future they iron out these and other issues.\n\nThe game is not bad beyond that, it is a somewhat average Binding of Isaac kind of game.","June 5","false","1.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's fun!! Responsive controls, fun premise and play, and good homage to other rogue-like titles makes Hashtag Dungeons work wonderfully well. You have LOTS of choices for difficulty, easy access to levels made by other players, and the tie-in to Twitter is more enhancement than annoyance...as it seems some folks may be a bit wary of that. I wanted to offer input early on, this being a new game at the time of this review...so even with little playing time in, it is an easy call to give Hashtag Dungeon a thumbs up...and with MANY games in my personal collection it's pretty easy to predict that this here game is a winner. So....great fun and astounding potential for re-playability adds to a game that is great for short runs or long ones and honors the procedurally generating rogue-like dungeon crawler genre while offering a fresh take by utilizing social media to enhance ever-new levels. Enthusiastic thimbs up from me!!","June 4","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Offering daily challenges with a scoreboard within the horde mode alongside an in-built dungeon generator offering a range of difficulties to the player.\n\nWhilst like most games it does contain a few issues such as being a little grindy at times and the 30 fps limit I would recommend you to give it a try if you are a fan of the games genre.","June 2","true","10.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Gameplay was easy to pick up, super fun and a great way to kill some spare time.","June 5","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I've had a lot of fun with it and it has gotten better and better with each new release. Nice pixel perfect graphics and excellent sound. If you like dungeon crawlers and showing off good scores, this is the game for you. It's also fun just playing the player made levels.","May 31","true","31.6"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","12","26","2","1"
