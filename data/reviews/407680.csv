"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/recommended/407680/","Faudraline","Faudraline","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Faudraline/","1196 products in account",""Life is not a problem to be solved, but a reality to be experienced." - Soren Kierkegaard\n\nLast Days of Spring (VN) is a very short, mostly kinetic visual novel about a bunch of teenagers finishing high school, and wondering what to do with their lives. Put together, it is not the most successful or interesting visual novel, but it's heartwarming and carries some basic wisdom for anyone just starting their lives.\n\nOur protagonist is Yuka Kishimoto. She is a high school student in Japan, who attends a school where her father works as a history teacher. She is an ordinary, well mannered, bright young woman who is at a total loss about her future. It is the last week of high school. These are the days that you won't be having ever again, right? The traditional Sunset Festival - which marks the end of high school for senior students - approaches, and it's up to you to figure out the ending of this chapter in life for Yuka.\n\nAs I mentioned before, Last Days of Spring isn't a great visual novel. It has some lazily snapped photograph backgrounds, no animation or voice acting; plus, the narrative has casual grammar errors. Sadly, there is no option for you to play this full screen either. The art style might be considered charming, but nope, nothing captivating. Gameplaywise, I wouldn't count any winnings either, considering it is a mostly kinetic visual novel. There are some choice opportunities, but I doubt that they'd change anything, since you can try each and every ending if you save properly at the last scene. Oh, and the save system gets whacky and fails to save from time to time.\n\nSo why am I giving this one an up vote? Well, I personally think the main message of the game is well-put and it's brief and sound advice for anyone to hear. This game is about choosing your own future, and the pressures of expectations. I find the approach of the game towards life, growing up and taking a place in society surprisingly realistic. I was surprised to see that there is more than one nonromantic - and quite logical - endings for you to choose at the end, and also a female option, which is quite rare in any of these games by itself. The game isn't long enough for you to observe any character depth, but some exchanged quotations hide pearls of wisdom that I wish someone shared with me at some point.\n\nAll in all, Last Days of Spring is a sweet effort in hopes of presenting the player with encouragement, telling you that it's okay to take your time and experiment in your life. No one should walk a pre-decided path and call it a life, just to appease the generation before himself/herself. It's your life. It's yours to seize and make anything out of, and this amateur VN is bold enough to tell this out load.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","November 2, 2015","true","2.8"," 49 of 54 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","49","54","0","1"

Some of the stock images are pretty but mix that with the messy sketch art style of the characters it really clashes.

I’ve played some bad VNs before, but wow… Last Days of Spring has some serious issues, the story and characters being the main one; the story was dull, characters were badly developed and forgettable, and your choices through the story barely matter at all. I liked the BGs (the only good thing on this mess) and that’s it. The art style was decent sometimes, but most sprites were bad (characters were ugly and expressionless, just like empty vessels). BGM was horrible, I had to turn off the computer’s audio (since you can’t do that on the own game).\n\n1/10, not worth even for free.","April 24","false","4.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/everydayS/recommended/407680/","everydayS","Zareh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/everydayS/","747 products in account","Not recommended - unless you get it real cheap or through a bundle (go idle for cards). The full price of 2,99€ is not worth it. The visual novel's setting is, as the steampage states, Japanese 'but using Native English vernacular and vocabulary'. Even though the setting is suppose to be in Japan, the characters and overall setting feel far from it. They've all got Japanese names, but that's about it. You don't get immersed into the story or characters. The conversations in the story feel very forced, robotic and too casual (like how one would converse on social media), which is a big turn-off for me. Lines such as 'Is this the train you normally take home?', 'I have to get off at the next stop but that was a seriously cool conversation we had' and 'How west in Tokyo do you live?' fly by. Then there's the waitress who is suppose to be working, but instead is starting a longass conversation and giving you unwarranted advice you never asked for - heck, you never even told her your problems. All in all, if you're looking for a nice enjoyable visual novel, look elsewhere.","November 26, 2015","false","3.8"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

I only have more playtime for card drops.\n\n---\n\nI tried to give this a fair shot, I really did. But this game is missing even some basic features.\n\nEach character only has one sprite, and the backgrounds are pretty clearly free use backgrounds. This might not be such a huge negative if the art was decent for the characters, but it's really not particularly impressive. Strangely, there is one character who kind of contrasts with the others in terms of art style, and I honestly wonder if she wasn't a pulled asset from a different game idea, because she does not fit in with the other characters at all in terms of appearance. The menu used is the default menu style for the program used to make this game, and while I don't think that's inherently a bad thing, it feels lazily done.\n\nThere are also no CGs in this game at all, so I hope you don't want those.\n\nThe music is so unnoticeable that I almost forgot to put a section for it in here. Thankfully, it is also inoffensive.\n\nAs for the story, oh boy. This game very much goes for the "tell, don't show" approach, which means long, boring descriptions about every little nuance about a character, rather than finding out those nuances yourself through how they behave. Another less-than-pleasant trait this game has is its weird random morality spiels. Like, one minute you'll casually be talking to a character about their cooking habits, then suddenly they'll go on about the job economy. What is that? I practically got whiplash from how fast the topic would change in the story.\n\nThe grammar in the game is questionable at times, to say the least. Because of the grammar, the dialogue does tend to have more issues feeling disjointed than it might normally, which doesn't help its case at all.\n\nThe endings are just bad. They're short and make little sense. I even counted the number of lines in one of the endings. Nine lines long. Do you think that's an appropriate length, even for a short visual novel? No.\n\nThere are many more visual novels out there, and I would argue that there are many free ones that are of higher quality than this. Give them a try instead.","June 4","false","1.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Your child isn’t willing to talk to you about plans after high schools because it so ain’t cool to talk to parents about serious stuff like that. However, your parental instinct tells you that deep inside your beloved child is worried about the future. You want to help, but you know they will never agree to talk it over, at least not at this age. You notice that your child likes to spend time reading visual novels, so you decide to wrap what you want to say in a visual novel. You do some research about visual novels on the internet and write a script containing everything you want to say (in high school student lingo instead of grown up chatter). You also call in favours from friends to compose some simple music, draw some simple characters, take some pretty photos for the background scenery, and package it all together.\n\nThis might be the visual novel that you would make.\n\nIt’s short, the plot could be smoother, you forgot to proofread the script, but it contains the caring message that you want to tell your precious child. That it’s OK to not immediately know what they want to do despite everyone around them looking like they do. That they have many paths in life to choose from. That they will always have your love and support no matter what.\n\nThen you put it on Steam because there’s no way your child would read it if you directly handed it over, right?\n\nDisclaimer: I am not affiliated with Sapphire Dragon Productions, the developer, in any way.

You cannot return to  read past messages.\n- All the characters have the same name color. Pretty confusing.\n- All the characters are always in the same pose and emotion.\n- The ending feels "rushed" and abrupt.\n- Not very polished: the buttons are not alligned, some transitions feel weird...\n- There is a character design for the protagonist (as you can see in the trailer, the header and the cards) but is not used in any scene of the game... Why?\n\nSo, in conclusion, I don´t recommend this VN. You can try it at a good sale and low price, but it´s easily forgettable.","December 27, 2015","false","2.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","3"

The extremely linear story (seemingly interactive but actually kinetic) provides nothing unique that every other anime/manga/VN utilizing pre-summer festivities have not shown before. The characters are bland and described using very basic stereotypes. The intro is also a bit cringe-worthy due to its amnesia tactic for explaining the setting, and the ending(s) are truly anti-climactic. It would be more appropriate to describe the various endings as shallow choices (who do you want to spend the festivities with).\n\nTraditional VN options are not present: skip key, text speed, resolution, etc. Dedicated save/loads are supported however.\n\n==== Score ====Overall, I do not recommend this VN due to the unoriginal storyline and primal UI.\n\nAverage\n- 5/10","May 7","false","0.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this game to begin with, and I got exactly that.\n\nThe only real good of the game was the character artwork, but even that has some flaws: every character only has one pose, so no matter what you're talking about or doing, they're always standing there smiling at you. For a game whose content is literally only artwork and story this is a cardinal sin. At the very least, every character should have some kind of reaction shot or two to better convey their emotions, especially since there isn't any voice acting.\n\nOtherwise, the story itself was mediocre. While it has the feel-good lesson of "follow your dreams", the dialogue feels unnatural at times (especially from Yuka's father), and the choices you make throughout the game don't actually affect anything. The only choice that actually changes anything is whether you'll walk to school or ride in the car, and the choice at the very end where you're able to pick the person you want to spend the Sunset Festival with. The game even warns you to save so that you can experience all of the endings.\n\nUnfortunately, the endings themselves are very lacklustre, you get a few lines of dialogue either about love or friendship, and that's it.\n\nIf you want an easy 100% achievements or trading cards, go ahead and buy the game for less than $1.
