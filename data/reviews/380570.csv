I've cooked fish and sold it to the scientist. I can figure out which spawn point I'm at by the position of the sun, hop on my bike and go right to Center City. I hang out there until a drop is announced - then go get and return it for a reward. The game's best attribute is it's game play. I'm sure a large team of artists could improve the graphics and sound quality but the game play is of primary importance. The game hasn't crashed on me at all lately.  One tip - you must have your flashlight on inside the buildings. Great Job on the GAME!\n\nMost of the negative reviews on here are from people who played the game for about 20 minutes or played a very early release.

Game seems to run a smooth 30+fps, did notice a few flaws which is expected.. if you are in a building and theres a enemy outside it shows partially through the wall. it seems to take a long time to level from 0 to 1. and the enemies seem to notice you from too far a distance to even be able to aim and shoot and by the time you can you are either almost dead or dead. In my opinion there should be more buildings you can enter and not ones that are just textured boxes. needs more building varieties as well.  the timer to even move when you have died doesn't seem nessesary since it takes time to walk across the platform and across the barren area to even get to any action. This game seems to show some potential with some work. I know the Unreal engine is capable of so much more and will edit and or add to my review as this game progresses.\n\nNow in my opinion is this game worth the asking price? Well yes it seems worth it since I have paid more for a game that was just totally not worth even a fraction of the cost.. (I am sure some can mention some bad games)\nThere is a gameplay manual for this game and I would HIGHLY suggest reading it so the game makes more sense.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=560020155","February 26","true","1.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

I thought there could be something, even the smallest thing, that would make this game worthwhile.\n\nAfter 20 minutes of playing, I regret to say, I couldn't find much redemption here.\n\nFirst launching this game, I thought "OK, a little rough around the edges, reminds me graphically of early PS2 era games, but it probably has potential! I mean, hey, what could possibly go wrong?" Well, me of almost an hour ago, almost everything went wrong.\n\nI won't get into the story aspect, since there isn't really much of one anyway (Oh, mysterious chemical accident of new elements! Oh noes!), but instead, I'll be focusing primarily on the gameplay.\n\nFor one, holy balls this game is clunky! Movement and character animations aside, aiming is almost impossible. Trust me, there are iron sights, but the iron has long been rusted. In fact, your squirt gun of a pistol doesn't have a sight AT ALL, making aiming a real pain to deal with. The only weapons I found I could moderately aim with was the hunting rifle and the shotgun.\n\nWith that in mind, now add in a very broken damage system and extremely dumb but unforgiving AI. There were a number of times where I died almost spontaneously and without much reason, if at all, and mainly it was due to the fact the zombies deal so much damage in such a short amount of time, you will die a lot. In fact, one instance, I was perfectly healthy and standing, when all of a sudden I collapse dead. Fortunately, I found I was able to keep all my gear, so no harm done there. Not only that, but the aggro range is extremely sensitive. No sense in being stealthy if you're gonna don get shot or mauled to death anyway.\n\nThis game has potential to be something, just the execution was done horribly. In fact, this game isn't worth the normal $1.99, hell, even the $0.59 I paid is too much to ask for this. The game just feels unfinished and overall uninspired. Axion will need a massive overhaul in order for me to change my mind and give this a positive review.","April 30","false","0.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Also the storyline lacks direction, if you are going to try and sell your game as having a storyline maybe something besides simply running in a direction until you find something would be good considering the vast number of enemies running around, and nowhere near enough first aid kits to stop the bleeding, which will occur within the first few encounters, or the rapid onset of sickness. Also the first several of my lives were short due to lacking food and water, which aren't in abundance either.

Its wird enough that it makes you curious and you may want to actually explore the wird world of bad game design .\n\nAxion could have been really neat sandbox survivor game but it falls apart because of countless issues both with gameplay and technical side .\n\n-Game often crushes . Every 15 minutes or so for me and based on that alone I can't recommend it .\n-Enemy Sound effect have such a huge range it always makes you think someone is near you even though they are far away .\n-Weapon variety is kinda useless . I find myself using regular gun more often than bigger guns because it works just as well .\n-Interactions with world are very limited which hurts the exploration value of this game .\n-Bugs,Bugs,Bugs .\n\nStill this game has the basics of addictive progression and some may find enjoyment in a bad game . I don't think you should buy this game but if you like me then maybe you will do it anyway .","October 20, 2015","false","1.3"," 4 of 13 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","4","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/380570/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","Axion is an unassuming open-world survival game, with themes obviously heavily borrowed from STALKER.\n\nWhat I immediately noticed upon starting was that the game looks like ♥♥♥, but surprisingly also runs like ♥♥♥. The graphics here aren't too impressive on any setting, but having to turn the detail down to Sega Dreamcast levels just to avoid a dip in framerate is not a good sign. Yet, the problems did not stop there. At every turn, I was exposed to the awkward draw distance that selectively rendered the same 10 buildings based on size, not on distance, the blurry and stretched textures that compose said buildings, and the ugly lighting that turned every indoor location into a high-contrast mishmash of pitch-black walls and glowing floors, where using the flashlight was absolutely necessary to smooth out the light and make it possible to see.\n\nThe crudeness of the graphics is complimented by the crudeness of the gameplay itself, where many of the missions degenerate into run-and-gun pieces of proverbial cake, with the only significant threat coming from the few enemies who either spawn in far too close for comfot, or can cover hundreds of feet in a matter of seconds. The enemies all have the same pattern; They just run straight at me and attack endlessly. If one gets too close, death is nearly instantaneous. Thankfully, most come running in from a safe distance on flat terrain, or sometimes straight through fishing ponds where the water is visually distinguished but might as well have the same physical properties as air. Theoretically, this would allow for plenty of time to react to threats. In practice, however, the muddy graphics quality combined with bizzare audio that makes pinpointing the direction and distance of sounds impossible inevitably results in taking damage, usually from an enemy with a ranged weapon. Take too much damage and it's game over; Rather, the player dies, and gets to respawn a few seconds later with all items intact and no penalty, other than having to make one's way back to the relevant spots on the map from the desolate respawn points tucked away in the corners.\nTake a lot of damage, but not enough to die, and you get a fracture, which slows down movement to an annoying crawl. Often, I found it more beneficial to let enemies simply finish me off if I didn't have thte materials necessary for a splint, as there is no real downside to dying.\n\nThe way that the game handles its great equalizers is one of the strangest cases I've ever seen. Sooner or later, the player ends up with the same variety of weapons and tools as in any other playthrough, including, but not limited to:\n- A shotgun that always does the same damage from any distance within its effective range\n- A bolt action rifle that gains an increase in both firing power and fire rate from a scope attachment\n- A Geiger Counter, its effectiveness hindered by its slow activation and the fact that many of the locations with harmful amounts of radiation look similar or identical\n\nThere are a few light RPG elements. Completing missions, hitting enemies, picking up items (even things already owned), and simply existing will provide experience points. Get enough, and go up a level, granting a skill point to be distributed among several abilities, most of which do create noticeable improvements in the character. I'm not so sure about "Luck", though, as most objects always seem to spawn in the same places every single time without fail. Maybe it has more to do with the enemies who spontaneously die. I dunno.\n\nOut of morbid curiousity, I checked out the multiplayer. There is only one server, providing enough space for only 16 people to play at the same time, which is not a whole lot considering the size of the game world. Needless to say, the server was empty every time I went on, and it was an experience much like that of singleplayer, with one exception: LAG. In some ways, it actually made the game too easy, like having enemies who would run to a point I occupied maybe 15 or 20 seconds ago.\n\nNow, to be fair, it's inexpensive, and there is one redeeming quality about this game: It's fun, but it's tough to explain why it's fun. It's like the empty satisfaction I get from putting a quarter that won't be missed into a generic-looking arcade cabinet, and then realizing 20 minutes later that the game has managed to keep me entertained thus far.\nI'm not going to recommend this. While it can be mildly enjoyable, I figure that this is because I've just spent so much time with it and have become accustomed to its roughness. As a whole, it seems like an early access game that was never finished, and there are many other games out there that provide a better such experience.","March 25","false","6.6"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

When going up against the A.I.'s I believe they was kind of delayed when they seen me so it was easy for me to kill them. I feel like maybe it's best to keep it one of those mission playing, Character building like games and not go to far out the box to keep it really good. For example what was that monster looking thing in the trailer? Highly doubt you will see something like that in a post apocalypes world or even in a video game. Unless they was making a game about Godzilla's child. The menu is kind of confusing too but that's probably me not knowing what do. It's really good though that you did make this game on sell for a dollar.","August 1, 2015","true","0.3"," 11 of 123 people (9%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","9","11","123","2","0"
