This is essentially an iPad type game that was 'ported' to PC.  "Fullscreen" mode means a low-rez mobile window stretched to fit your native resolution without adjusting the size of the game screen, etc.  It's really bad.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's essentially one of those mindless clicker type games.  Extremely grindy, every battle you get a small amount of coin that every ~25+ battles will let you buy a piece of equipment that is what you have +1, etc.  There is no actual strategy or decision making in the battles either, its just fight till you're almost dead, then pull behind troops and wait 30s to regen, rinse, repeat.  No plot, no combos, no strategy, no choices, no decisions, nothing.\n\nThat said, it's an entertaining premise, and would make a great addition to the App Store at a $1-2 price point.  I'd actually buy it for that much, and play it while I am taking dumps.  Just doesn't belong here on Steam, or on anyones gaming machine.","December 14, 2015","false","0.6"," 157 of 179 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","157","179","8","0"

I don't think this will reach a wide audience but it's still got some very good points.\n\nI'd like to start that this is a rather old game and quite text light compared to this company's usual affair. Probably why it was the second of their games to get translated to english.\n\nNow, here's what this game is, as I think a lot of players are looking at it the wrong way. The battles, at least for the first chunk of the game are rather simple, and can mostly be won without your help. That doesn't make them boring and simple though. The main goal of this game is to rake in some mad money, experience and points in each battle. And you only get those for your own contributions. So either your character or your direct bodyguards need to get the kills.\n\nA few things that aren't explained too well is that you only gain experience for every attach you do. So you need to run your character to the frong line and manage positioning so you don't die while keeping your troops alive. If you don't level up much the later battles will floor you. So while your allies are killing you need to rush in and try and score as many points as you can by targeting the right enemies, while managing to attack as often as you can taking as little damage as you can. This makes even the "easier" levels really challenging. If you don't do much you can beat level one gaining a single experience point, or you can beat it gaining 100 if you position yourself in each battle correctly. The more you do in a battle also nets you more gold allowing you to do even more in future battles.\n\n--TLDR--\n\nIt's a game of managing your position and troops to attempt score as many points in a level as you can, not just to kill the enemy commander. The strategy and challenge is in managing your fame in each of the battles.\n\nIf that sounds fun to you, pick it up.\nIf not, then this won't win you over.","December 14, 2015","true","2.0"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","37","54","4","0"

You just take your little princess avatar near enemies, shoot your magic bolt and try to steal kills from your troops to level up. Battles are very repetative and there isn't much as far as upgrades go. What you see in the screen shots is all there is to this game. When you win battles you get some gold, xp if you killed enimies and some more troops to add to your personal body guard. The more you win, the more territory you gain. If you lose, you just lose some territory.","December 15, 2015","false","1.7"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

This game is so simple, and yet somehow fits into the category of also having so much potential. It is one of those games that does so much, with so little, that fits into a genre that is casual, and yet not at the same time. And after playing it for about  15 hours (Yah steam doesn't seem to log hours with all games properly, if you start them from inside the file folder, as opposed to the steam browser) I can say definitely, that unless I misread the tone and character of the dev, you DO NOT want to buy this game.\n\nThere are 4 troops types for which the player can use. They are so strange to be apart of the same Army, that when you see them, you instantly think "Oh these are just the starting units for a much larger fighting force." Really there are 3 unit types, with the 4th being the "Base" unit you receive from winning battles. You cannot recruit more of these, you can only turn them into Mages, Ninja or Mummies.\n\nThe game FEELS lke it belongs on phones and tablets from a year or two ago. it is so simple like that, but can still be engaging, actually LETTING you control your troops as you run around the battle field trying to defeat the enemy general. Most games like this, play themselves, giving you very little actual control. This game gives you control, but gives little else.\n\nA few pieces of equipment for the Empress to equip to get stronger, that with levels make her a force. You get gold to spend on that equipment, or to change your knights into mages, ninjas or mummies as stated above, but so much is left wanting, it is shocking. The amount of options this game DOESNT HAVE makes me think the dev was literally trying to do the least amount of work possible, and release a product, to see if he could get away with it.\n\nWith a little more work, making 3 dozen more units, equipment types, Empress Ability types, battle functionality, and/or the Dev being smart and actively making the game modder friendly, this game would easily sell 50 times whatever it happened to sell so far. There is no doubt in my mind this game could have been amazing, and still could, if the dev and publisher actually wanted to make a brilliant indie game. I am not convinced that was there goal at all, which is why I cannot recommend this game, and will never do so, until they change the direction of this game.","December 17, 2015","false","1.0"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/421890/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","I want to recommend this game (or would if it was in early access) but I simply can't. What drew me in was the massive amount of units that were about to go to war. What I got in return was an RPG mixed in with a few command elements with seemingly missing links. It looks like promising game play on the outside, where the inside is completely missing detail.\n\nAvaris 2 : The Return of the Empress has you in control of the empress with limited abilities. When a battle begins, the player can control the empress by the mouse. Left click is movement whereas right click will order units where to get into formation. The movement is a bit clonky and is limited to 8 directions. Shift will speed up the games process while space will launch the empress's special attack. This special attack cannot be changed and remains consistent throughout the game (which is really unfortunate). Furthermore, you are unable to adjust the radius in which the special attack fires. It is set to one distance and can only be fired from this distance. This means that you must move the empress accordingly or you risk attacking your allies. Additionally (fortunately), your empress gains experience points and does eventually upgrade.\n\nAfter each battle, there is an RPG element in which you may convert regular soldiers into ninjas (faster movement), mages (magic/range) or undead (slow but strong). All this conversion costs gold. Gold is a bit hard to come across at first but the game does throw bonuses your way eventually. Units themselves cannot be upgraded (only converted) whereas the empress may upgrade her sword, shield and magical ring. Unfortunately, upon beating the game I reached a peak where I seem to have the best of the best (even after pressing F2 to refresh the market. Oh yeah, you can suddenly swap merchants at will). Once you get what you need, there is nothing amazing that comes across that will change the dynamic of the game. If they added abilities to the units that could be commanded (or upgraded) it would have added a lot more depth to the game. The one thing that was done right was that every aspect of the game could have been explained with their help feature. Movement, objectives and indicators are always present to help the player easily figure out what needs to be done.\n\nBattles themselves are okay and the empress will attack any enemy in proximity. Either than pressing space and shift maybe a few times, there isn't much else to do than point and click. It is kind of crazy to see so many units on one playing field duking it out.\n\nThey did a decent job with the HUD. You don't have to actively check how much mana you have to see that you can fire off your special ability.  The graphics are at best mediocre. Some of the explosion graphics I recognize as stock from game maker gif's. I don't mind stock explosion animations were used but I would have appreciated some personal touches. Sounds are at best mediocre as well. Upon killing someone, a sound will be played. This sound however, will never change...\n\nFor the price, I absolutely do not recommend it. For an extreme sale price, I would. The replay-ability may not be great, but the massive battles may entice some users. FYI though, once you reach the top that's as far as you can go. The game will "restart" but how fun is it running the same course over and over? I couldn't even take screenshots in game with steam overlay :(.\n\n\nRATING : 5.0/10","February 19","false","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

That's my personal dream, to have huge battlefields with many troops fighting. I've been a huge fan of Dynasty Warriors which has a lot of on screen troops fighting too. Avaris 2 is very simple though, and has many troops on screen fighting for you and thy king with the day and time of battle constantly changing with the scenarios changing along with it. In night you can't see where your enemies are until very close and the troops are randomized. Sometimes you'll be heavily outnumbered and sometimes there will be a huge amount of troops on screen!\n\nPositives\n+ Simple game with lots of fun to be had\n+ Upgradeable troops, weapons and items\n+ Tactical\n+ Many troops on screen\n+ Controller support\n\nNegatives:\n- Resolution\n- Hard to control troops\n- Very simple graphically\n- Gets a bit repetitive\n- Simple options in menu\n- Battlefield never really changes much\n\nI personally really enjoyed this game and would recommend it, Yes its very simple and yes, it may have been on mobiles but I didnt not do research for that. This is on steam and treated as such. I had difficulties at first controlling the character, i feel the character movement could be done a lot better but the amount of troops and positions you can find yourself in is fun. Suddenly facing off against hordes of people whilst upgrading yourself, troops and armor in each round.\n\nI would avoid this game if you're looking for a game more advanced or dislike simple games. If you can appreciate the game for what it is though, much fun can be had on it. Feel free to watch my preview for a better idea of the game.
