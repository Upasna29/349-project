"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleetcommand/recommended/403410/","fleetcommand","FleetCommand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fleetcommand/","521 products in account","Disclaimer\nThe sad thing that this review can be applied to the whole "Arcade Game Series" collection since they all have the same pros and cons.\n\nWe go retro, don't we?\nThe other day I was thinking "Okay, we have Atari Vault and that's a great retro collection. I wish other companies would do the same and finally a nice Galaga or Ms. Pac-Man would arrive to the PC.".\n\nThen I come home and what do I see? Bandai Namco just released my favorite games!\n\nInstabuy. Then disappointment.\n\nWhat I love about the game?\nNice emulation\nSolid gameplay\nThe controls feels good\nAchievements\nOnline leaderboards\nScanlines can be turned on\nWhat makes it a lazy port?\nIf you go full-screen, the "bezel art" goes behind the playfield, so the sharp corners of the playfield become visible\nTo go to full screen, you have to press Alt+Enter. No menu option to do that.\nCan't turn off "bezel art" (or "background", as this game calls it)\nNo volume sliders. In a 2016 release.\nThe only way to quit the games is to press Alt+F4. I'm serious. No menu option. Nothing. If you play in windowed mode, you can just click X, but in full screen? No chance.\nKeyboard prompts everywhere. Even if you use the controller, it shows keyboard keys on the screen. You need to use at least 10 different keys to adjust the screen size/position, but you cannot do that with a controller. Even if you can, the game won't tell you how.\nYou can "zoom in" the screen for the games to utilize your screen space. But if you zoom in, the always visible "press esc to go to the pause menu" prompt covers the bottom right corner of the playfield. WTF? I can't see the dots I'm eating in Pac-Man.\nYou have to watch the "when this icon shows up don't turn off your computer" screen every time you start the games and you need to press a key for it to go away\nJust nitpicking, but why does it appear FULL CAPS in the Steam Library? I have all four games in the collection and it looks horrible.\nSummary\nWhichever game you choose from Arcade Game Series, you get a great game. You get a lot of fun and great emulation. But the overall quality is not acceptable for a brand new release in 2016.\n\nIf you just want a few nice arcade retro games but don't eager to have Pac-Man or Galaga, check out Atari Vault. If you want Pac-Man, well, unfortunately you have no other option. Pac-Man Museum is even worse.\n\nUpdate - Apr. 26.\nTo be fair to Namco, they released a patch today which allows us to turn off bezel art. If some of the other things would be fixed too, I'd change my review to "recommended"","April 20","false","0.9"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","25","32","3","0"

Best I've played on PC.   Emulation could still use a bit of work. At least for me, it felt like controllers needed a bit of work.  I use a wired 360 controller and there seemed to be a bit of lag at times or it wants to go upwards on its own.  After playing a few games, it nearly makes it unplayable when it goes up when you want to stay still or go in a different direction. Also frustrating when you try to move and it does nothing.   Great deal for a bit of nostalgia.  but as far as a functioning game, it needs work.","April 23","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
