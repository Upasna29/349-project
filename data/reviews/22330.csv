I figured that there was no need for me to review this game as it is so successful, but, as always, All the Steam reviews on the front of the store page are one to two sentenced jokes instead of something actually helpful. Please thumbs-up this, if you like this review, for visibility.\n\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the sequel to the critically acclaimed The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. Knowledge of prior storylines are not needed to enjoy Oblivion, though a working understanding of TES world lore will always enhance your experience in any of The Elder Scrolls games. A good idea is to just read some of the in-game books, from time to time, as you play the game. Some of the fictional books are amazing little detours from the game world. Oblivion and Morrowind are less fantasy experience and more-so a virtual world that you live in. With mods, this experience feels more real to me than some of the Dungeons and Dragons campaigns I've played. It's incredibly easy to get immersed into this work.\n\nOblivion's main story leaves some to be desired. You are a prisoner who meets the Emperor (voiced by Patrick Stewart) and his guards as he flees a rumored assassination attempt through hidden tunnels in the Imperial City prison. Suffice it to say, that its' not really a spoiler that you witness the Emperor's assassination. Before the Emperor's death, he tells you that you are fated by the gods to save the Empire and "close shut the jaws of Oblivion". Long story short, you flee the tunnels and are sent to track down the Emperor's last remaining illegitimate heir (voiced by Sean Bean) as well as pretty much single-handedly repel the invasion of Daedra from Mehrunes Dagon’s hellish plane of Oblivion.\n\nHowever, in classic Elder Scrolls fashion, the main quest isn’t even the largest part of the game. The entire Imperial province of Cyrodiil is open to you for exploration. There are many guilds to join, whether or not you want to be a mercenary, a mage, a thief, an assassin, or a holy crusader. There is an abundance of miscellaneous side and freeform quests for you to do. I recommend the purchase of a strategy guide, not so that you’ll have a walkthrough, but because you’ll need some way to keep track of where everything is! There are many quests and areas that you will miss if you don’t scour the world for them. You can easily spend around 350 hours if you finish all of the main, side, and faction quests as well as the DLC. Many people just wander across the world, not even touching the main story.\n\nThe mechanics have long been applauded as an improvement over Morrowind, level scaling aside. Morrowind offers a better story and atmosphere, while Oblivion offers a more modern experience. The graphics are a bit dated by today’s standards, but I still sometimes catch myself stunned by the beauty of Cyrodiil. Skills are a lot more streamlined than Morrowind, which I consider a negative trait, although it does make the game friendlier to newcomers. Combat is not as bad as so many people claim. To me, it really feels like I’m actually swinging the sword. The magic system is a lot simpler than Morrowind’s but a lot easier to use. It is not as good as Skyrim’s magic system, but still useful.\n\nThe DLC The Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles far trump Oblivion’s main quest. Knights of the Nine puts on a holy crusade to fight against Umariil the Unfeathered, an ancient Ayleid elf who has come to try to enslave men once more. The Shivering Isles sends you to the frankly breathtaking realm of Sheogorath, the Daedric  “Mad God”. Most of the dialogue in The Shivering Isles will have you chuckling to yourself and smiling. And the atmosphere of the realm brings nostalgia from Morrowind to mind.\n\nNow, I am going to discuss mods. Oblivion’s modding scene is unparalleled by Morrowind or Skyrim. There are enormous overhaul mods, plenty of lore friendly stories, and enthralling and immersive stories and factions. You can even reach an added five or six hundred more hours if you play through some quality mods. Morroblivion, brings the entire landmass of the previous game, Morrowind, as well as all of it’s quests, items, NPCs, creatures, etc. You can then travel between the two provinces with your same character. Other mods add some of the other provinces from Tamriel. And a few mods have been so well rated that they’ve become known as unofficial expansion packs.\n\nOblivion is an astounding RPG that will draw you in and stick with you for a long, long time. The replayability of Oblivion is excellent. The game was released eight years ago and I am still playing it to this day. You will not regret buying this game. Get the Deluxe pack for $25 that comes with all the DLC, themed player lairs, and, yes, even horse armor. It is well worth the price and you will get your money’s worth over and over again.","June 27, 2014","true","292.6"," 1,631 of 1,653 people (99%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","99","631","1","4","33"

I leveled up punching stuff, running places, and jumping to their maximum level but when I went to the arena I had trouble. I easily defeated my opponents by punching them until they could no longer stand up, then continuing to punch them as they lay bloody on the arena's dirt floor. I heard the crowd roaring as my fists crashed into the Grey Orc's skull; I felt their love wash over me like a crimson silk gown. Slowly, after the vampire scum gave out his last breath, I walked out of the arena. Not in triumph, not in victory, but in remorse. I had just punched my way through a dozen or more skulls, and for what? In my agony I gloomily set up at the The Bloated Float Inn, located in the Imperial City's Waterfront District. I woke up to the sounds of rustling, was confronted by a clearly beligerant bandit. The man had no idea I was the Arena Champion, he had not heard how I crushed the skulls of countless enemies with my punching, how I jumped clear over them with little effort, or even how I ran circles around the arena dodging every single attack thrown at me before pummeling my opponents into submission. The very idea of the man standing before me, a person unknowing of my athletic prowess, set me in to an uncontrollable rage. I don't recall what happened over then next ten minutes, but my memory picks back up again standing inside of the Inn owner's cabin covered head to toe in blood. I navigated back through the ship, which now more resembled a slaughter house, to try to find someone who could tell me what happened. Located in the messhall I found a naked shivering woman named Selene. I will never forget the look on her face when I approached her, a visage of fear so vivid the viewer can feel it.\n\nIt was then I realized what event must had befallen the denizens of The Bloated Float Inn. The ingorance of that would-be bandit set me into a blood fueled rage. I slaughtered every person aboard the ship for his sin, that is, every person save for this trembling woman. I decided then and there to never use my fists again, I set off from the boat, WHICH HADN'T LEFT THE HARBOR, to embark on a pilgrimage. One that would encapsulate all nine divine shrines and eventually lead an unwilling khajit boxer to defeat the ancient Aylied king Umaril using only Talk good skill, run fast skill, and jump high skill. After defeating such an awesome foe I came to the conclusion that one need not fight with his fists to attain his goals. Through the use of hecka convincing words, speedy feet, and super strong legs, anyone can stamp out evil without ever lifting a finger.\n\nOblivion taught me the greatest lesson of all, that fighting is evil.","July 21, 2014","true","2.0"," 802 of 892 people (90%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","90","802","892","61","15"

I have hundreds from total conversions to one that adds little street cats that wander around looking cute.  Oblivion really captures the DIY aspect of PC gaming I love in a shiny giant studio package, allowing me to change almost anything i don't like about vanilla.  Unlike console people, to merely review and make judgements based on vanilla is to miss the beauty of PC gaming.  It's that kind of community that keeps an aging game fresh interesting and addictive.\n\nAs far as the extras in the GOTY go, whether you care about player houses shapes much of  the DLC, Mehrune's Razor quest is a large dungeon, nothing mind blowing if you play with Lost Spires mod, but some very shiny loot.  The Knights of the Nine was a fairly straight-forward quest, would call it a good DLC rather than an expansion pack as such.  However although you have to seriously stab someone at the end, at least some of the quests have variety in what you have to do a bit.\n\nHowever Shivering Isles makes this edition worth your money imo.  It adds some much needed oddness to the game, the kind of thing where you pause to think 'wtf is that?' as some creature shuffles or leaps towards you.  Without getting into the whole 'which elder scrolls is best', one thing i felt was Oblivion and Skyrim settled with standard pseudo-medieval europe fantasy world, whereas Morrowind felt quite alien, but with it's own culture to be read about and discovered.  Shivering Isles brings that to Oblivion.  The books are a delight, and it's nice to experience a daedric realm aside from the Deadlands (which while fun, never felt like a place people lived).  All in all and bearing in mind what i said about the still quite vital mod community, I totally recommend you buy this game.","October 28, 2013","true","449.8"," 571 of 627 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","571","627","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruhrgebietheld/recommended/22330/","ruhrgebietheld","ruhrgebietheld","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ruhrgebietheld/","49 products in account","I've noticed that the reviews for Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim tend to be about why that game is the best Elder Scrolls game and the others are terrible in comparison. I really enjoy all three of them (sorry, Arena and Daggerfall, you're just not very enjoyable by today's standards), so I figured I'll give reviews for each that focus on what's unique about each of them, and what kind of players that will appeal to.\n\nOblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game (and my first open-world RPG in general), so it has a special place in my heart. Anytime I hear that music come up when I launch the game, it brings back all sorts of emotions and wonderful feelings related to discovering a whole new type of game that I thoroughly enjoy. As good as the music in Morrowind was, Oblivion's music is even better for me (both are better than Skyrim's).\n\nFor positives, let's start with Oblivion being the most deliberate of the three games. What I mean by that is that things are the most contained and orderly in Oblivion. You don't "accidentally" do anything in this game, as opposed to Morrowind and even Skyrim to a degree. Leveling up is slower in Oblivion, and so you don't race through anything. It gives you plenty of time to savor everything. You don't start a new game and find yourself pimped out with super powerful gear or spells a couple hours later. The landscape is also fairly contained, with each region and city being unique in its own right, while not having any drastic changes. The most extreme the landscape gets (besides when you are transported to the hellish realm of Oblivion or the DLC that sends you to the Shivering Isles) is some snowy mountains in the north. And for this game, that works perfectly. You are in Cyrodiil, the center of the empire, and therefore the most refined. The somewhat subdued landscape fits into that perfectly. Compared to Morrowind and Skyrim, this game world is neat, orderly, and prim and proper. It makes you form an emotional attachment to the game, since you focus less on the landscape and more on people and feelings, while still enjoying beautiful scenery. And when you get to the Shivering Isles DLC, you're well versed in forming those emotional attachments, while now having some very bizarre and magnificent scenery to add to your playing experience.\n\nThe biggest positive of Oblivion (for me) is one of the most pleasant surprises in the entire series. My single favorite thing in any TES game is what would seem to be some relatively minor DLC from this game. There are four distinct castles, lairs, caves, and towers available through the DLC. Each is geared towards a specific playstyle (warrior, assassin, thief, mage). There are all sorts of things available for each, and some questlines regarding them. I find myself spending a lot of time doing those quests and getting enough money to afford the upgrades, some of which are incredibly useful (alchemy ingredient gardens, a pirate crew that goes out and plunders for you every week, a dark shrine to Sithis that grants you potent powers based on your infamy, etc.). There are also unique items in each. Basically, they are the greatest player homes in any TES game, and they're official content, not mods.\n\nFor the negatives of this game, we will actually revisit some of the positives I mentioned. It's slower than the others, which can sometimes make you feel bogged down. It's polished, nice, and orderly, but sometimes you want something more wild and rugged. Think of it as the difference between living in a nice suburb and living in a cabin in the Rocky Mountains.  There's not really anything wrong with this game, but it always stays in the safe zone. There are no glaring errors, but its peak is lower than the other games. Basically, Oblivion is content with always hitting singles or doubles, so that means that there are no strikeouts, but also no homeruns.\n\nOblivion will disappoint you the least often of any of the three games, but also won't take your breath away like Morrowind or Skyrim does occasionally.","February 6, 2015","true","56.3"," 262 of 273 people (96%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","96","262","273","13","11"

Then what? Oh, its just PICARD TELLING YOU YOU'RE IN HIS DREAMS. SECRET. PASSAGE. HE DIES (OH NOES) TAKE THIS SEXY AMULET. GET OUT OF THE SEWERS. EXPLORE FOR 100+ HOURS.\n\nWell, you can already tell this game will be incredible.\n\nBut seriously, this game starts off very strong. You're a prisoner, with your crimes unknown to you. As long as you don't abuse the character creator (hehe...) you'll be able to mold your ideal elf, human, or orc... or cat... or lizard. But yes, many great awesome things happen in the first few minutes within the game. You may think the game is linear... until you exit that sewer.\n\n"Can I go anywhere?" "Can I follow this road?" "I want that horse. Can I steal it?" The answer to all this is a glorious "yes". Oblivion is at it's best when you're wondering along the vast land of Cyrodiil, exploring multiple dungeons, mines, and towns. Oblivion is outdated, but still pulls you into the world.\n\nQuests are great. Some surpass Skyrim's as far as story goes. (The Thieves’ Guild quest line is so much better.) There are both your typical quests with markers, and a well mix of a few. Ranging from some puzzle solving, to even being a detective, it'll keep you entertained. Help out a town by shutting down an Oblivion Gate (which furthers the main story), and now you can buy a house there, and buy upgrades for it, just for playing the main quest. Kill an innocent person, and have a very unique visitor appear, and follow a very dark path. Either way you'll be getting into all sorts of crazy situations, and it'll be a delight.\n\nGameplay is more complex than Skyrim, yet not quite like Morrowind's. I consider it a perfect balance, as its tough, but very rewarding. If you're a weakling, maybe you shouldn't steal that horse just yet. Oblivion in a way pushes you to a certain type of major, as if you’re taking college classes. Keep shooting that bow, and you'll advance specially in that skill set, and use your experience to further develop this. But if you pull out a sword after not using it for three levels, well you might want to rethink what you're doing. It’s not hard, but the game defiantly wants to pick one type of combat and stick with it. This is fine to me, as I love dedicating my character to a specific type of combat. If I want to be good with a sword, and have some good magical ability as a side dish, I can do that. It'll just take time.\n\nThis game probably has the greatest DLC ever. The horse armor has so much value... well not really THAT specific DLC, but Shivering Isles is a MUST HAVE. You're getting another free game when you purchase this. Knights of the Nine is harder to get access to due to the slow leveling progress, but is also pretty great. Get GOTYDeluxe, its worth the extra $5, you penny pincher.\n\nMods, mods everywhere as well. There are some greats ones. In fact, this game taught me how to mod. I might of ruined my first save file(s) tough doing that, so be warned; there's no silky Steam Workshop bed waiting for you upstairs. You must use either your brain, or a Mod Manager application.\n\nFor those complaining that it isn't working on Windows 7; The Steam (digital) version seems to work fine, and there's a mod called "Unofficial Oblivion Patch" which solves many conflicts and errors, and is stupidly simple to install. Get the latest version patched for your game as well. In fact, before even launching the game, you might want to do all these things I've mentioned.

I was gifted the game when it came out on the Xbox 360. And after that, I continued to play it till I gave the game to my girlfriend 6 years later and bought the GOTY version on PC, which I'm playing at this moment. I have a lot more hours on PC Skyrim simply because I thought it would be better.  I was wrong. I'm now adding to my collection of inhuman hours of Xbox 360 Oblivion.\nDon't get me wrong, dear Skyrim fanboy. It IS a great game, with amazing atmosphere and graphics. It one-ups Oblivion on graphics, since it's 4 years younger. But when it comes to atmosphere, Skyrim might as well be a cardboard box. Here's why:\nOblivion's soundtrack is rich and beautiful, unlike Skyrim's flat "Dovahkiin" "Badass" default track every time you get in a battle.\nSkyrim's main questline is almost nessisary, since it contains the Shouts that are so very fun to use. Oblivion's main questline, however, is lots of fun, and optional. You'll miss out on items, but you'll never be lacking in a critical game ability that was the gimick of the entire launch.\nSkyrim is flat and snowy, with SOME differences around the eastern and southwest parts of the map. And when you are in those green areas, it still feels like it's about to freeze over. Oblivion has snow, beautiful snow in fact, but it's SO diversive in the enviorment section. Beaches, forests, mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes, ponds, actual Oblivion, it's all amazing. And the colors are so vivid, with reds and greens and yellows and blues and OH GOD ITS GREAT.\nWhen you fight a bandit in Skyrim, you're swinging a pool noodle at a mural. When you fight a bandit in Oblivion, it's head will twist to the left when you deliver the final blow with your Elven Mace, it's body crumpling to the ground, ready to plunder ( and sometimes teabag ). No silly spinning death animations that need a mod to disable like I have, just ragdoll. Like real life.\nAll in all, Oblivion is ahead of it's days. It was an improvement to Skyrim in the atmosphere department, not graphics. I LOVE Skyrim for all of her faults ( one of my favorite gaming moments of all time were my first 2 hours in the Forgotten Vale, absolutely breathtaking ) but Oblivion takes the cake. Morrowind? That's a different story. Totally different subject. I don't have much experience with the game honestly, so I can't effectively make a decision over who wins in the entire trilogy. And yeah, it's a trilogy. ( EDIT, I know Elder Scrolls isn't a trilogy. I was tired and wrote this half-arsed. Stop commenting on it :) ) ESO sucks ♥♥♥♥. I said it.\nBuy this game, with the DLC. It ain't no map pack, it's two seperate and amazing questlines. Just buy the game. Right now.","November 2, 2014","true","108.3"," 659 of 775 people (85%) found this review helpful 84 people found this review funny","85","659","775","84","67"

It gets a bad reputation among fans of other elder scrolls games, you see the argument that Morrowind is the game for patient players that can enjoy an older game, and skyrim is this big new awesome RPG, and so Oblivion is seen as some weird spot in the middle of the two. Yet I repeat, oblivion is the best game I have ever played.\nMany Morrowind players dislike Oblivion with the argument that it is less inclusive and immersive than Morrowind. But then why is Skyrim the only game on par with Morrowind? Skyrim, the game with less weapon types, the game with the worst alchemy, the game with the worst magic? Skyrim's graphics barely surpass the incredibly captured beauty of Cyrodil, and they had five years to make skyrim. They had four to make Oblivion, and your blind grandma could easily tell the difference between that and Morrowind graphically. The gameplay was also a complete overhaul from morrowind to oblivion. People talk about how Morrowind's or Skyrim's fighting systems are so much better, with Morrowind's realistic feel that you have to be good with the weapon type or you will be awful, or with skyrim's realistic feeling combat but Oblivion completely build anew the combat system of morrowind, made it insanely more realistic, and remains the only game in the series that you can have a sword, shield, and spell at the same time.\nFrom Morrowind to skyrim each game got easier. Morrowind is the most difficult of the three, with no quest markers on a compass, and no advice or help whatsoever. But when I went to play skyrim it was the easiest thing in the world. Anyone can take a nord with a battleaxe and beat the game. Oblivion is in the middle. Oblivion isn't like the insane difficulty of morrowind, showing how hard each quest would be were you actually to do it in real life and record the words that someone said to find a secret location. Oblivion helps you, but is not easy. The game has an easier start, but if you can remain powerful past level 30, that's when you know you're good. Skyrim is just always easy. Progress through oblivion is kind of like progress through life. The lower your level, the less you have to worry. But as you grow into the game it takes constant effort and maintenance to remain successful. In oblivion you have to have a gameplan. Will you be a thief that goes around and gets rich to make sure they have the best equipment in the game, and talks your way out of hard situations? Will you be the the brute warrior that relies on lots of stamina and power to take down less physically gifted enemies? Or will you be my personal favorite, the mage that can go about every situation in a million different ways? Sure, you can mesh these things to any degree, but the point is that if you don't go about it correctly with skills that make sense together or you use the wrong race, you won't be successful later on.\nYou could go on forever about the systems in place in oblivion that make it unique and amazing but Oblivion is the game that revolutionizes combat and especially graphics (Oblivion had some of the best graphics the world had ever seen, and was made on such a large scale that's almost an unimaginable feat) but sticks true to the elder scrolls mentality. Skyrim is a game to pull people into the franchise. Skyrim is the start of a new generation, a worse generation, of TES players. Oblivion is the peak in the series.","November 20, 2014","true","61.0"," 509 of 594 people (86%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","86","509","594","26","29"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072118811/recommended/22330/","76561198072118811","littlefiredragon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072118811/","40 products in account","First of all, if your question is "Should I buy this game, period?", my answer is simply: Yes.\nIf your question is "Should I buy this game, or skyrim?" the answer's a bit more complex. I would not say either one is better, but they're two different tastes, like vanilla and chocolate.\n\nIn this case, I would say Oblivion is the vanilla. If you're looking for a straight-up, classic medieval fantasy, Oblivion might be more your thing than Skyrim, which is "themed" around the viking-style Nords. Likewise, Oblivion has the default fantasy setting of castles and forests and rolling green plains, where Skyrim is, again, Nordic themed, and focused mostly on mountains and snow.\nBecause of that, and some differences in art styles, Skyrim and Oblivion look very different, to the point where I would almost say that might be the deciding factor in which game is right for you. Skyrim is very much a modern game, with fairly realistic art, and that includes the recent trend of realistic games to be primarily brown and gray. Oblivion, on the other hand, is vibrant and colorful, and perhaps a bit stylized. If you are longing for a colorful first person fantasy game, Oblivion is for you (if you're looking for a sidescroller, I'd recommend Trine). If you've been wading through the Real-Is-Brown trend, the sheer vibrance of Oblivion can be a real breath of fresh air.\n\nAs for gameplay, the two games are relatively similar. I personally prefer the spellcasting setup in Oblivion over that in Skyrim - in Oblivion, you equip spells in their own slot, rather than in a hand (which could instead be holding a weapon), whereas Skyrim just treats spells like a sword that has to be put in one of your hands. Speaking of which, you cannot dual wield in this game. If you want to play a classic sword-and-shield knight, this particular difference in mechanics is more or less irrelevant, except that it's easier in Oblivion to cast the occasional healing spell.\nFurthermore, Oblivion offers a much greater degree of freedom in spellcasting than Skyrim. You can create your own spells by adding effects and designating whether the spell is a projectile, area of effect, etc. Enchanting and Alchemy are slightly more complex than in Skyrim, as well. If you like playing spellcasters, I'd say Oblivion is probably a better choice than Skyrim, which has you simply pick from pre-determined spells, and has a far more limited alchemy and enchanting system.\n\nThe biggest mechanical difference is the level up system. Without a doubt, Skyrim's level up system is more user friendly and intuitive. It might be a little more friendly to those who want to play these games casually, where Oblivion requires a little more care, planning, and effort. In Skyrim, you level up your skills as you use them, and after you've increased any combination of skills by a certain amount, you can go up a character level (on the spot, even). When you do, you increase one of your three stats (yes, only three: health, mana, stamina), and pick a talent tree to put a talent point in, which gives you bonuses - with different talent slots unlocking as you raise the respective skill. In Oblivion it is completely different. For one thing, you have several stats, each tied to three skills. The number of times you level any combination of skills attached to a given stat affects how much you could POTENTIALLY increase that stat by when you level up (and if you dont' get those +5s, you will find that the game swiftly outlevels you). By the way, you only level up when you raise ten points in any combination of your class's seven major skills, and only when you sleep. Skyrim has no classes, and therefore no major skills. This makes Skyrim's character-building system a little bit more freeform, as you can, if you want, change directions as you go, if you decide you don't like a particular aspect. Oblivion allows you to create a custom class, but you're basically stuck with that choice after you finish the tutorial.\nIn short, Skyrim has a simpler, more intuitive, more fluid leveling dynamic, good for building your character as you go according to what feels natural, while Oblivion might be better for those who like to plan or min-max, and requires a bit more thinking ahead.\n\nI should also mention that on certain computer systems, the music in this game may not work. It certainly doesn't work on my system, but otherwise the game runs just fine. From what I understand this is an issue with the CODECs and may be related to Windows 7.\n\n\nOne other thing I think is important to mention is that this game, despite being a fantasy, is surprisingly arachniphobe friendly. As someone with arachniphobia, I find it hard to deal with how ubiquitous giant spiders are in fantasy games. Skyrim's spiders are particularly horrifying. But Oblivion has no (true) spiders at all. It does have the Spider Daedra, which are essentially spider-centaurs, but I didn't find them particularly phobia-triggering. They're also very rare outside of the oblivion gates, so you won't often find yourself being jumped by one unexpectedly. If you are an arachniphobe looking for a fantasy game, I HIGHLY recommend Oblivion, especially if you're comparing it to Skyrim.\n\n\n\nAlso, this game has Martin Septim.\nThat's reason enough to buy it.","July 13, 2014","true","379.0"," 169 of 172 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","169","172","0","12"

It would take too long to list all the various quests, armor, weapons, enchantments, and magic spells you can learn/create, simply trust me when I say this game is an adventure waiting to happen.\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: This is probably one of my personal favorite parts of Elder Scrolls of Oblivion, once you get out of the starting area you can make your own story, or follow the main story, or go search for your own quest. If you wanted, you could become a villain, you could also become a hero. The choices are completely up to you.\nThe whole Elder Scrolls series is very rich is lore and diversity of environment, you can read in-game books and learn useful facts about the monsters you fight. Not everyone will do this, but I ended up learning what all Trolls are weak against, and I've been using it in all Elder Scrolls games since.\nI won't say much more about the story, because most of the fun is in finding the quests and stories yourself, and of course forging your own tale.... however there is one additional thing to note, in the Game of the Year Edition you get the Shivering Isles Expansion, and there you meet my favorite character in the whole series.\n\nGame Play: You can control the camera to play in third person, or first person. (personally I always thought third person looked silly... the knee's bend funny, and when you jump your legs stay straight. seems like an indication of "play in first person").\nYou could be a necromancer and summon skeleton hoards, you could be a thief and sneak into combat, you could be a warrior and smash your enemies faces in, you can be a mage and even create your own skills, you can be a ranger and pew pew, a monk, an acrobat or any hybrid combination of what I've said and much much more.\n\nAchievements: There are no Steam Achievements in this game, you can certainly find plenty of challenges online to test your skill in the game, or simply increase the difficulty of the game.\n\nPrice The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition is priced at $19.99, as always, I suggest you wait for a sale, but if you already know you like this style of game you won't lose money out of it, since the game is getting "old" *cough cough cough* you should probably look for a good deal out of the game, it goes on sale often.\n\nConclusion: This was the first Open world game I ever played, I absolutely loved it, and I still remember the fun I had playing the game. The stories/quests are very memorable and the game play was dynamic and very fluid. I recommend this game to anyone who enjoys open world or RPG's.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update March 18, 2015:\nI redid my review for Oblivion, thereby normalizing it into the framework I do for all my reviews. (No one ever read the old review anyway, you're not missing anything)\n\nUpdate June 23, 2015:\nCorrected release date from 2007, to 2006.\n\nUpdate September 14, 2015:\nHere's the URL to see my review for  Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Including links for Skyrim DLC reviews!)","March 18, 2015","true","159.3"," 138 of 148 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","138","148","5","10"

I didn't know anything of the game but one day we decided to start it up. Choosing my race and fine tuning my character was something new to me and blew me away. Then the game continued with the dark elf mocking me from my prison cell.\n\nAt that moment I was hooked and bought it for myself the next day for Xbox and then a year later for pc. It was the first game I modded and I closed every gate and explored every crevice of the map. I have spend thousands of hours on this game on the non steam edition and will play this game off and on until the day I die.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/22330/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","Overview\nThe Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the fourth installment of the series and one of the most known and loved fantasy RPG in gaming. Released in 2006 by Bethesda, the game is still very played to this day, and has a very active modding community, which is a testament of the life-span of a great game. Embark on a journey full of lore, quests and dungeon explorations in this masterpiece of a game.\n\nThe ProsEnticing Gameplay - Oblivion is a game that really nails it when it comes to gameplay. You always find some new quest to do or a new dungeon to explore, people to gossip, barter or fight with. The large, open map provides many opportunities to explore and create your own adventure. Even if you already completed the game and know the majority of quests, it’s still fun to replay them. The quests are very well done, and much more diverse than one might expect, primarily due to the rich backstory they provide.\n\nLong Completion Time - Don’t worry about running out of things to do. There are over 200 quests and 400 locations to discover, explore and loot. Not to mention this is a Role-Playing Game. You can have multiple playthroughs, each with it’s own different approach on what and who you are, how you attack, and how you respond at moral decisions in quests.\n\nBeautiful Soundtrack - This game has, in my opinion, the best soundtrack in the history of gaming. The music is very well made for each situation. It is relaxing when wandering, thrilling when in battle. Jeremy Soule really hit the nail on its head on this one.\n\nModding - Head on over to Oblivion Nexus to download and install a few of thousands of available mods, that fix most if not all problems vanilla oblivion has. Bug fixes, texture enhancements, ENBs, UI redesigns, quest mods, item mods, gameplay tweaks, and so much more are being offered by the modding community. This is one of Oblivions strongest points, and will definitely make the game several times more enjoyable. Just make sure you take your time to research, download and organise them before you start playing.\n\nExpansion Packs - We all know the famous “Horse Armor” DLC fiasco, but let’s not get in the way of its actual expansion packs, namely Knights of the Nine and The Shivering Isles. The latter is considered one of the best expansion packs that were ever released, and comes included in the Game of the Year version on Steam. It adds lots of new content, including maps, items, quests, characters and  gameplay elements.\nThe ConsVanilla Version - This is just informing you that the vanilla game you get when you first download it is a bit underselling. The graphics are outdated(Duh! 2006 game) and there are quite a few (hundred) small bugs and other inconsistencies that may occur during gameplay, the faces of characters look… well, hideously ugly in some cases. All of these problems and many more are easily fixed with a few tweaks and mods and you can enjoy a better, prettier, and more stable version by installing them. There are loads of bits and pieces I could write long rants about, but there’s a mod for all of them, so I won’t bother. I will concentrate only on the things inherently bad about the game that cannot be fixed (in most cases)\n\nVoice Casting - Given that Patrik Steward voiced about 5 minutes of emperor Uriel’s lines, the budget was already out the window, so we are left with about… a few handfuls of voice actors, each representing their race. This makes it a little weird having every member of a gender and race sound the same, with a few exceptions. Albeit, in order to do this, each actor recorded the entirety of the dialogues, even ones that would never be used by their characters, for safe-proofing. A lot of work to be admired, however the problem of little to no diversity between characters’ voices is a little disappointing. Which isn’t to say they sound awful. The sound quality is good and the actors are talented. It’s just that everything sounds the same. Also, you may encounter beggars that change voices radically between different topics.\n\nTotalitarian Crime System - There is a running gag of the telepathic guards that roam Oblivion in search for you. Doing any murder, even in complete and utter stealth, even in the most devoid of any witnesses location, that crime will be recorded, a bounty will be placed on your head, and sometimes guards might leave the cities in search for you and they know exactly where you are. Not only this, but touching items is a crime. You are a guest in someone’s home. You see a misplaced fork on the table and just want to nudge it a bit to align it with the plate. Yup, you are going to be arrested. Or say you broke in someone’s house late at night, and you steal an apple. That apple is now known throughout the entire province of Cyrodill as being stolen and cannot be sold to anyone but thief guild fences. You can come to a merchant with 20 apples, but he will specifically know that only 18 of them are righteously yours. You can’t sell the other two. How!? Why!?\n\nUneven Leveling System - (fixable by mods) The world seems to be leveling with you, which seems stupid. By about level 20, every common bandit you find will be equipped with the best grade weapons and armor, which breaks the immersion and unbalances the game. Also, attaining the perfect character (max stats) requires a deep understanding of the leveling system and painstakingly much micro-management.\nConclusion\nIt may seem the cons list is longer, but trust me, this game is amazing. It is one of my favorite games of all time, and have been rocking a lot more hours before I got it on Steam. If you like RPGs, then this is a must have. I recommend it with all my heart. Be sure to mod it and to try to find everything there is to do in it.

It looked so outdated, i couldnt stand the graphics, and having briefly watched people play it in the past it didnt look like it could ever compete with a game that holds such a great magnitude as Skyrim. I am happy to say that i was completely ignorant for thinking that and Skyrim will be collecting dust for a while. So my friend gifted me this and i started playing, the first few hours were like meh, not sure what to think. As i explored more of oblivion and got into the main quest and starting seeing the guilds, the mechanics in this game and the depth surpass skyrim in literally all aspects.. And ive only been playing for around 3 days now and already clocked in 20+ hours. The amound of lore, the unbelievablely deep quests and the characters that you remember. Its absolutely mesmorizing. To think of the age of this game and the fact that im just starting now, in 2016, to get into oblivion i dont even know what to say. This game is the best rpg ive ever played in my life. It keeps the player interested as i continue through the game and keep wanting to learn more and oblivion actually makes you want to learn more about the lore behind the elder scrolls. It has inspired me to eventually buy morrowind as ive become so interested in the lore behind the elder scrolls because of this game. It feels so much more authentic than skyrim. I enjoy the combat so much more. And it is so much more immersive than skyrim wil ever be. And i only have very few mods for the game. The exploration aspect of the game is so much more rewarding than skyrim's and you actually have to put in a lot of work to become even somewhat powerful. This game is a committment and makes you work your ♥♥♥ off for the things that you want. So anyone who plays the hell out of skyrim and thinks its the best RPG. I dont care what year it is, put that game down and give this one a try. You wont regret it.","May 7","true","54.0"," 115 of 121 people (95%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","95","115","121","9","5"

"Ermagerd Skyrim is better Oblivion sucks cus graphics!!!11! You're just an Oblivion fanboy!11!!!". Well no.\n\nI first started playing The Elder Scrolls series a few years back, when Skyrim first came out because of all the hype. Reason why it shows a ridiculously low number of Skyrim playtime hours on my Steam profile would be that I didn't get the Steam version as I didn't have a Steam account then. I finished the entire main storyline, finished all the DLC, 90% of all sidequests and explored almost 80% of the dungeons in Skyrim.\n\nNow, I only got Oblivion after much insistence by a few of my friends. At first, I was very turned off by the bad graphics and  combat system. I compared it a lot with Skyrim, but I tried to look past the graphics. It was then I got really surprised. Funnily enough, after playing Oblivion for awhile, I like it better than Skyrim. I appreciate and get attached to the characters in Oblivion more than the characters in Skyrim.\n\nMaybe it's because the character development in Skyrim pale in comparison? Or maybe it is because they hardly (almost never) kill off companions in Skyrim. In Oblivion, a lot of the main characters of the side quests  even the main quest  get killed off, and you cannot simply ressurect them using console  like if you accidentally kill off Lydia in Skyrim. Face it, everyone does that , because their death is crucial in that plot.\n\nI like the change of pace in Oblivion compared to the rest of the games I have played so far, because you are not the main hero here. You are just a Blade, assisting the next Emperor to take over the throne and stop Mehrunes Dagon. You do not get to do the final blow to the villian, you do not get to be "hero" at the end of the main storyline. Because someone else close to you will do it for you. And trust me, you will get this feeling of emptiness for a very long time after that.\n\nThe soundtrack is really beautiful here, although it may make you feel lonely especially when you are exploring the wilderness. The horses actually make a satisfying galloping sound, although they are not as ridiculous in climbing vertical walls.\n\nIf one were to compare Skyrim and Oblivion, I would say they are both incomparable. It's like comparing an apple and an orange. They are similar, but you cannot directly compare them both. If you are looking for something different, and something more story-based, and a f*ck ton of plot twists, go for Oblivion. But if you are more of the graphics, modern-day sandbox game which follows a linear plot, go for Skyrim instead.\n\nOverall, I enjoy this installment, will definitely put in more hours in this game.","April 19, 2015","true","68.1"," 137 of 154 people (89%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","89","137","154","9","0"

Oblivion needs you!\n\n--WARNING--\n\nMake sure you buy the GoTY DELUXE version of the game - if you don't, you'll miss out on all of the smaller DLC, as they are not sold seperately and cannot be purchased afterwards!\n\nEDIT:\nIf you're looking for better graphics, check out Oblivion Reloaded @ Nexusmods, link here: http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/45749/?\n\nOblivion Reloaded replaces previous versions of OBGE and overall is more power and efficient than alternatives (possibly even ENB).\n\nSo yep, the game is still being modded.\n\n--\n\nReviewing Oblivion is a little tricky for me because I've had it for years. Many, many years. I've literally had it since sometime during good ol' 2007. Thousands of hours easily poured into the none-steam version of the game, and time I do not regret putting into the game.\n\nIt was, simply put, a centrepiece to the later years of my childhood. I enjoyed it so much I bought it on Steam too, so in case I ever lose any of the disks for whatever reason, I've got the steam version as a backup.\n\nSo beyond countless hours playing the game, I've also got another issue. Mods. One really should not review a game on the basis of what users have created out of it -- even if modding is a huge aspect of the game -- but I do have some difficulty doing so accurately doing so, so you may have to bare with me.\n\nGameplay:\n\nOblivion had unique gameplay. For someone who had never played anything like it, Oblivion was something above and beyond anything I'd ever played. To this day, Oblivion has a number of unique gameplay features that aren't present in, say, Skyrim. I'll give some big differences below.\n\n- An attribute system. Each attribute governs a number of different skills and has a number of affects. Attributes such as Endurance, Agility, Intelligence and so on. For many players such as myself, these attributes add something extra to the game.\n\n- Fame and Infamy system. Your actions have a limited impact on the world in terms of disposition. People will react to you differently - murder lots of people, and people will react to it in terms of their opinion of you.\n\n- Repair skill and durability of weapons and armour - you need to manage the integrity of your equipment, or else watch it degrade and eventually break. There is even a hand-to-hand skill, so you can train yourself to kill people with your bare fists if you want to.\n\n- Disposition system. People like you more or less depending on events, infamy/fame, quests and even the silly mini-game in the game you can use. Personality attribute also has a big impact.\n\n- Scaling in the game is, to be blunt, terrible. At the beginning of the game, you'll find a rather friendly and not so hostile world. Deer will roam the wilds and slaughterfish will slaughter you whilst mudcrabs pick at your corpse. Skyrim does this slightly better, but mods can fix this in Oblivion.\n\n- Birthsigns are selected at the beginning of the game and have a permanent effect. Your birthsign will have a number of effects, ranging from lesser and greater powers to minor impacts on your attributes. This initial decision may full well shape your character in ways you will not be able to change later.\n\n- Working item moving. It's much better in Oblivion than Skyrim - you have much more control over the moving of items around your house and all that, with fewer bugs and what-not.\n\n- Lots of different armour pieces. Greaves, Gauntlets, Chestplate, Helmet and Boots.\n\nAnd much more. Actually, there is an entire page dedicated to it right here, including the differences between Morrowind too: http://www.uesp.net/wiki/Differences_Between_Morrowind,_Oblivion,_and_Skyrim\n\nNow onto modding (my original review with minor edits).\n\nBeyond vanilla gameplay, which intitially I thought was great, mods can turn the game into something completely different. Add in Deadly Reflex or UV to get a deadly and bloody game, despite being somewhat unrealistic. Or maybe go for Duke Patrick's combat mods and find yourself playing a realistic combat game.\n\nOr download thousands of other mods and mix and match to create a game that is unique for you. Don't like the levelling and skill progression? No problem. Grab numerous mods that edit the system, changing it into something more casual, more hardcore or even something completely different. XP system? Gotcha.\n\nI've played the game through multiple times over the years. I have to say, I'm still not bored of it, though I did take a break for a couple of years whilst I played Skyrim and Morrowind.\n\nGraphics are a little bit dated. But plenty of mods around it to bring it up to Not-Quite-Skyrim quality.","November 2, 2014","true","15.8"," 122 of 134 people (91%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","91","122","134","13","15"

It has enough RPG elements to make one playthrough of the game different from another.  Combat and bugs are aplenty, but the quests and varied map make up for those shortcomings.\n\n9/10\n\nI first played this game back when I was 13. This was the first Elder Scrolls game that I was subject to (I was slightly too young to be interested in Morrowind at the timeit was released).  I had never played a game that allowed for such open-ended exploration and freedom.  This blew my mind when I first played and it seemed like there was always something new to find out in the world.  As a kid obsessed with this new experience, much of the flaws never really surfaced.\n\nFast forward 10 years.  For nostalgia's sake, I take another trip down memory lane.  It isn't as fantastic as I remember it (but nothing is as good as the first time).  The exploration is still the best part of this game (as it is with all Bethesda games), but the problem is, once you've seen everything, a game can get old quick when it relies heavily on exploration.  This is the problem with all future Bethesda games (but that's a conversation for another time).  The quests are what elevate Oblivion.  There are still some fetch quests, but I think those are few and far between in this game.  If there are fetch quests, they dress them up and throw in plenty of twists to make it interesting.  The best part is there are tons of quests in this game.  Reliving those, or trying out new ways to complete them made this second playthrough incredibly enjoyable. Oh, and do yourself a favor and play through the best DLC/expansion Bethesda has ever made.  Shivering Isles was so diverse and included so much content that I feel like I still haven't done everything to do there.\n\nDownsides: Bugs, no real controller support, potato faces.","March 24, 2014","true","177.2"," 586 of 786 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","586","786","0","12"

Almost approaching the same as Unreal Tournament and the early Battlefield games (BF1942, BFV and BF2); we're talking several hundred gigabytes of free content at least (I have around 500GB for Oblivion and over a Terabyte for Battlerfield 2).\n\nThe initial stage of the game where you have to escape the cobwebbed, dark and sometimes dank dungeon is   a little depressing, but still   a pleasure to experience the first few times around (it’s one of only   a few  linear parts of the game - another one is where you get transported into a painting), then you hit the outside, exiting the dungeon via a sewer drain.  On my first time it was a moonlit night and I was actually awed by the sight that I beheld.  I could see   the dark shapes of mountains and   the moonlight gave an eerie look to the small clouds slowly passing by.  The sky was full of glittering stars and I could see some distance ahead to a small broken down castle keep, all of which, even in the dark looked amazing.  I thought Morrowind was fantastic, but this was even better.\n\nI waited utill sunrise and was even more impressed by the amazing vista before me, Mountains  clothed in forests, morning mist,   a sun rise that looked almost real and  amazing,  the lush grass waving in the breeze, and    a whole host of other things swamped my  visual cortex.  Every step of the way, I marvelled at how realistic the grass, rocks and other objects looked.  Buildings, the imperial city, villages and towns all had their own distinct feel and charm.  The transition from night to day and back to night  is a pleasure to see; with HDR lighting, bloom effects, specular highlights and  parallax mapping  giving the game    some of the best visuals I’ve seen to date (well, maybe not the last    couple of years of AAA  game releases).  The effects are amazing, even now seven years after its release it still looks brilliant.  You can get several mods that improve many of the textures (the largest of these is around 3GB in size).\n\nThe usual RPG elements are present; for example, levelling up, plus  resource collection for  crafting magical weapons and  potions as well as stocking  yourself with  better armour, weapons , arrows, spears, potions etc.    Combat is nothing special, but still satisfying when swapping between bow, sword spear and magic.  Despatching enemies isn’t too hard, especially once you’ve got a steady stream of healing potions.\n\nIf you still haven’t purchased this game, now is the time to get it.  It includes   the expansion The Shivering Isles and the mod package Knights of the Nine that contains several   new missions, etc.  You can see several videos HERE,  HERE, HERE, HERE and HERE.\n\n\nThe first one is  the escape from the dungeon, the next  two videos are in and around Cyrodiil  and the last two relate to the Oblivion gates.","December 22, 2013","true","36.9"," 77 of 82 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","77","82","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheScottishGod/recommended/22330/","TheScottishGod","Wasdom Kung™","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheScottishGod/","239 products in account","The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion is by far my favourite in the series. I have played the Elder Scrolls since Morrowind came out way back and have continued it's amazing legacy in my life to this very day. Of course, it comes with bugs and glitches but what do you expect from a massive RPG such as this? Anyways, besides from the graphics and quests, my favourite part of this game has always been the modding community and also being a part of it.\n\nMy days began way back when I was 12/13 so a good 6 years ago, when I discovered mods and how awesome they were. Graphics were always an important thing in mind so mods such as Qarls Texture Pack 3 (the best one at the time and still is I believe) was an amazing thing to have. All the small mods, such as keychains, graphics, sound overhauls, OPEN CITIES etc were what made this game, and also the rest in the series truly amazing. Sure having a flying dragon or flying skyship was awesome, but it wasn't something you'd always be using and seeing.\n\nThere were still many bugs in the later releases however an Unnofficial fix was released (many times) to fix what Bethesda could and did not. This helped greatly with smooth gameplay and to fix errors.\n\nI haven't covered nearly 5% of what I wanted to type as this game is just truly amazing and my favourite in The Elder Scrolls.\n\nCheck out PlanetElderscrolls and The Nexus for mods and make sure you know what you're doing by reading the Readme files and guides.\n\nIf you have only played Skyrim, you probably won't like Oblivion that much because everything isn't as 'immersive' graphics wise, but to us who started here, I think we can agree that the Replay Value outnumbers Skyrim's.","October 11, 2014","true","3.0"," 96 of 112 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","96","112","0","0"

Was either taken out, or refined and polish for a much smoother experience.\n\nThis game is huge, then what the game let's on. From quests just about almost everywhere you go. With impress lore and backstory. Not to mention the various challenges in these dark and creepy dungeons. Another great thing about Oblivion is it's class system. Unlike in Skyrim where you play as you want. Here you play based on a set of class. And therefore the game experience for you could either be hard or easy, Depending upon what class you play as.\n\nTo add on the 500+ in Oblivion you got a stable (still active) modding community plus DLC quests like Knights of Nine and Shivering Isles. Which that place adds even MORE hours into Oblivion.\n\nTo add on this amazing experience is these beautiful towns and cities filled with the sam- der i mean different variety of characters each one having their own set schedule, personal opinon, and even the way they see you (through fame or infamy status) the world is very active around you within this game.\n\nThere are at least two negatives about this game, that i can point out.\n\n1. NPC's are literally forgettable, this being the reason why Skyrim's NPCs are vastly superior than Oblivion's NPCs, and more flexiable than Morrowind's NPCs. The Oblivion character models are literally the same, except with a few minor face tweaks with the hair, nose, eye color and so on. Plus with the same voice acting it doesn't really help who is who in the world.\n\n2. Combat is sluggish, Yes. Even though it's a class based system. It will take a while, a long while before finding the right tune for your character to even remotely survive in the combat. Really it's just: block, lung, block, fire a spell, block. Rinse and repeat. Sometimes you are on the defensive the entire time or not even bothering going through that dungeon and just drinking buffer poitions outside the dungeon. Can you say it's because of the player level..perhaps. But even then the combat is still sub-par.\n\n\nIf you love a cross between Morrowind and Skyrim. I highly recommend getting this game. This is the one to have in your RPG collection.","June 6, 2015","true","23.6"," 52 of 56 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","52","56","2","1"

Oblivion is one of those games that only comes from time to time, just imagine how much the developers put into this game, time, ideas , money. Thank you Bethesda! I confess it was the first game in the Elder Scrolls series I played, so I can not compare to Morrowind, and Skyrim I barely played, then I'll make a review based solely on impressions of the game.\n\nIt took a while until I get to continue on a character and finish the main quest, the game requires dedication, Cyrodill world is vast , the possibilities in a TES game well, you need to explore,  learn about, otherwise you will getting lost as I did several times and so I abandoned the progress with other characters.\n\nThe wealth of detail is impressive, the plot of the main quest not, but everything else makes up for this fact, the quests are very well written, some are so smart that I was surprised. The possibilities are endless too, this is a true Role Playing Game, you can make a character and be what you want from a killer thief going through a heroic warrior to a simple traveling merchant, or all together.\n\nThe graphics are outdated and mechanics are strange at first sight, especially the combat and movement, and the animation of NPCs give the impression that they do not have emotions. Despite this the game is still very good, the graphics can be improved with mods, you get used to the mechanics and also the sound effects are well done. The community is huge and active, there are thousands of fan-made mods that help solve problems, improve gameplay, graphics and add content that make it practically a new game.\n\nI highly recommend it, but as said, you need to devote to it, it takes a while to get a feel and learn how the gameplay works, how the skill system and leveling for example. But there are wikis for it with everything you can know about TES: Oblivion, I recommend consulting to aid, but being careful with spoilers, of course.\n\n9/10","December 15, 2013","true","97.3"," 42 of 43 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","42","43","0","0"

Great, but morrowind's was better.\nGameplay? It has aged. I won't hide it. Skyrim really has better mechanics for basically everything, but this game is a lot simpler to pick up and has better quests and storylines.\nAtmosphere? Best out of the series. Although they couldn't afford to hire more than 8-12 voice actors.\nGraphics? Good for a game from 2006, but it still looks amazing on max settings. Still, graphics mods polish it.\nPhysics? Try decorating your house. It's painful.\nLeveling up and build system? Complex, but dumbed down from Morrowind, for the better.\nGame length? Doing every quest and completing every guild + all the DLC = More than likely 200+ hours. Very rich.\nBetter than Skyrim? Absolutely. But it has aged, and won't live up to the more modernized style of Skyrim.\nHas it aged well? Not quite, but you can still play it if it doesn't crash. From what I know, some cards actuall aren't compatable with the game. Mainly AMD cards, but see what cards can run this game before you buy it. It may be 20$ thrown out the window if your card isn't compatable.\n\nMost negative reviews are either about how it can't run on their computer or how people like it for nostalgia. Don't listen to those reviews. The game is well worth the 20$ if you are really into vintage games like this that are heavy with roleplay elements that aren't dumbed down.","November 19, 2014","true","142.5"," 50 of 62 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","50","62","4","13"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/recommended/22330/","positron_","ρоѕιтяои_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/positron_/","291 products in account","The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an absolutely great title and is one of, if not, the best titles in the Elder Scrolls series. Oblivion was my very first introduction to the Elder Scrolls and I enjoyed the game so very much from start to finish. The sense of immersion along with the well balanced gameplay and epic storyline was quite enjoyable for a roleplaying enthusiast like me. This title is so chock full of adventure and combat that it will keep you busy for hour upon hour which will eventually compile into weeks and months before you realize it. Graphically, you have to remember that this title was released quite a few years ago, it pales in comparison to some of todays RPG's but even so I found the basic game to be quite beautiful with a uniqueness of it own that completely fits the fantasy world and story that it places you in. I said that graphically "it pales in comparison to some of todays titles" but I think this game still looks as good if not better than alot of the current roleplaying games available...this title was ahead of it's time and the work that the developers put into it definitely shows. Of course, as with many of Bethesdas RPG's, after you finish the basic game the first time you have the ability to modify the game to your liking for many more playthroughs by way of the Oblivion Nexus. You can mod the game from the start but I as well as others agree that playing through the base untouched game the first time is a wise thing to do. This title is simply fantastic and is highly recommended!!!","August 13, 2013","true","83.3"," 32 of 34 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","32","34","0","3"

I've heard friends who felt it was not a big step above Morrowind. In other words, they were disappointed with how little was changed. They wanted more of new game design decisions, and Oblivion, following all basic guidelines of the previous games, was not such a huge leap forward that someone expected. At the same time there were others, who felt lost and enraged with the amount of obscurities in compare with their beloved TES 3. "Conspiracy of simplification", some people called new trends, shown in the Oblivion. "They trading deep, thoughtful gameplay for WOW moments!"...\n\nIt's been almost a decade since then. We saw Skyrim, Fallout 3 & 4, many other open-world RPG and wanna-be RPG titles. While it's a common thought that Oblivion was not a bad game, the main question is - Is it worth something now? If you haven't played it before, by what conditions would you like that game and will be motivated to actually play it? Simply put - should you buy it now?\n\nIn the line of Elder Scrolls games, despite common lore, every volume is quite unique. Morrowind goes with oriental motives, religious cults and huge, comprehensive and insane magic sandbox. Skyrim is about Nords, snows, dragons and their powers, and really huge open world to explore. Really, like hundreds of hours of adventuring...\n\nTES IV has its own focus - the Central province of Empire, being overrun with hordes of demons from the lower plane called Oblivion. The problems of central governance and very dramatic main storyline, with all adventuring and other freeride activities pushed away in favor of highly orchestrated quests. The Empire in perils, the one and only Emperor dead, along with all legal heirs... The high dosage of Pathos seems unavoidable. Is it a bad thing? No. The Oblivion still much more free-play oriented than, say, Dragon Age Origins or Witcher. And those "orchestrated" quests are not giving the feeling of moving in the narrow intestines of scenario where you're more of the observer rather than actual actor. Some of those quests will be memorized as perfect examples of quest-writing and performing. You know, the gold book of RPG quests, bonfires, fanfares, all that stuff...\n\nSure, the creators of Oblivion dropped many of the gameplay mechanics that Morrowind fans were proud of. On other hand, we've got a world much more alive and reflecting with your actions, than it was before. All those things that were simply nailed to the one place in Morrowind, including god-like beings like Vivec - in Oblivion have not only a place to be, but the duties to perform and some logic to praise or disregard the course of current events in the game plot. Although... less static doesn't necessarily means good dynamics. It is safe to say that the world of Oblivion is not that capable for providing player with adventures as Skyrim. Besides main story line and some of fraction quests (like assassins or Daedric quest lines), some of us could even find that Oblivion is somewhat dull. On the contrary, the world of Skyrim is noticeably less colourful, so there certainly will be others, who like Oblivion More than Skyrim...\n\nYou know that? You should try it for yourself. Placing yourself in the sabatons of the knight-by-fortune, saving the Empire from fires of Abyss...\n\nMy mark will be 7.1/10. I'd give it more, would there not been all those useless pricy dlc's like shiny "armored" skin for horses. They downgraded my overall expression out of the game, but it is still a nice piece of work, well-worth of attention from any RPG fan.","March 30","true","170.2"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","8"

When you join a guild or faction in Oblivion, you slowly work your way up to the top. When you join a guild in Skyrim, you are super important right from the start. For example, The Dark Brotherhood in Skyrim has you as the listener right after the first couple of grunt quests. In Oblivion, you don't become the listener until the very end, after you've poured your heart and soul into completing every quest. This is just one example, all of Skyrim's guilds are like this. Oblivion makes you work for your success, its storyline is better, and the overall feel of it is much more memorable. Skyrim is a good game, Oblivion is a FANTASTIC game, 10/10 would erase my memory and play Oblivion all over again.

The combat is basically like slicing butter, but it's fun. I love how vibrant and human the "potato-head" NPCs are, and how colorful Cyrodiil and the Shivering Isles are.

It comes from a time when Bethseda was changing markets, from PC based RPG's, to more casual easy to pick up games. It also came at a time when games were first marked with the treachery known as DLC.\n\nIt would be a lie to say that Oblivion does not suffer from this casualization to some degree, the forefront simply being that system requirements for consoles forced the devs to reduce content in a lot of areas. namely spells such as levitation or jump from Morrowind as players would be able to fly over city walls that simply had to be closed off.\n\nIt also brought along click and go fast travel. Morrowind was all about exploration, getting lost and killed was all part of the game. This lost feeling never really happened with Oblivion.\n\nHowever, along the lines, Bethseda never really was sure about everything. they still had proper enchanting and spellmaking, they still had very good quests and something that Skyrim was never given. Character building.\n\nSimply being able to set up your character made the game feel whole. Bethseda's has always been bad with supergod main characters over agent of change characters for RPG's... but in the sense of the universe, it makes sense, for who the character is.\n\nSkyrim didn't give you the opportunity to set up your character. You could be anything. Oblivion, you could be anything as well, but at least you still had skills you were mastered in, attribute's about your person you can change. Morrowind, you better make damn sure to use the skills you started with until you had the gold to start training in them. before that, well, you better select some Magic skills if you wanna even talk to someone from the Mage's guild.\n\nAnd the quests. If I said gravekeeper would you know who I was talking about?\nwhat about this 50 gold for a set of nice silverware.\nmother?\nAyleid statues?\nCheese, Yarn and lettuce?\n\nif you don't, well, you should. if you haven't played it, you would instantly know why you remember these once you do. because, unlike future games. questing involved questing. not going into a dungeon dodging skinwalking jerky geezers who occasinally yell at you so hard you roflcopter the floor whilst saving the day from bad dragon. or another settlement needs our help.","January 31","true","168.6"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","22","22","5","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragontroopbeta/recommended/22330/","dragontroopbeta","DragonTroopBeta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dragontroopbeta/","217 products in account","I have been wanting to review this for a while on Steam. When I first picked this game up in 2007 for the Xbox 360, I fell in love with The Elder Scrolls at a level Morrowind could never install upon me.\n\n62 hours played? That's on the Steam version. I have well over 1500 hours invested in this game. And there is STILL a bit more ccontent I haven't covered.  Mostly small things, like fetch quests and in 100% honesty I have never gotten around to finishing the Knights of the Nine DLC.\n\nVisually, the game hasn't aged very well. Combat wise, the game is rather simplistic. Let's talk about those.\n\nNow I usually don't take visuals too seriously, but keep in mind a game of this scope back in 2006 didn't have high requirements for visuals. A lot of people complain that the faces of most of the human races look really odd with questionable colouring, and that Orcs just look like green humans with different lips and teeth. Completely true. However, that doesn't really do much to your immersion, in the long run. The enviroments are huge, the number of running proceses overturns the 300 mark, and in 2006 you couldn''t have good graphics, a huge world AND good performance all at the same times as loading areas smoothly and quickly with no FPS drops. For what it has to work with, the visuals at the time were very good. Well done, lads.\n\nSegmenting towards gameplay, let's talk about the combat. If you have played Morrowind, it will feel dumbed down, if you have played Skyrim it will feel rigid and overly fast-paced. The combat AI is pretty bad. I'll give you a rundown of every enemy's AI:\n\nMelee Weapon equipped, no Shield.:\nIf the enemy is visible, attack it. Between every 3-5 basic attacks, use one of 3 power attacks. If low on fatigue or have just used a power attack, block for a few seconds. Successful block means it's time to basic attack 2-4 times. Restart cycle. Never block if you are a monster like a zombie, troll or bear, but do block if you are a Ogre, Spider Daedra or Mountain Lion.\n\nMelee Weapon and Shield:\nIf the enemy is visable, charge in. Do same formula as with no shield equipped, but block before each cycle and power attack if the opponant attacked you while blocking.\n\nRanged Weapon:\nFire when visable. Step aside between each shot. If enemy is close, switch to melee weapon if one is in inventory.\n\nMagic User:\nIf it breathes, cast a spell at it. If it is close, use a touch spell. Use melee weapon when they are close, then back up after 1 cycle.\n\nYeah, not the smartest combat AI ever. If they have a low movement speed, you can literally just kite them with a longsword, spell or bow, and they will never once change tactics. Bad AI is bad. But when not in combat, they are generally interesting. They react to your crimes, reporting them to he guards or shrugging it off depending on how much they like you and what factions you belong to, and each and every civilized NPC has a full in-game month's worth of routines - shopping, sleeping, talking, running around on a horse until they get killed by highwaymen... very detailed stuff.\n\nThe rest of the gameplay is what makes up for the poor combat. Oblivion was designed as a story and world-centric RPG, rather than a combat-based one. You can spend 200 hours just shopping and decorating your house alone. Did I say "house"? I meant "houses". There's 8 of them, without DLC. I personally wish the Shivering Isles Expansion - the biggest expansion for the game - had a house you can buy within the Shivering Isles. It's a new map to explore, with crazy good quest lines, and possibly the best Daedric Prince of them all, Sheogorath, Prince of Madness. Let me give you some of his Scottish-voiced lines:\n\n"I once dug a pit and filled it with clouds....or was it clowns.... it doesn't matter, it didn't slow him down. But it really began to smell! Must have been clowns. Clouds don't smell, they taste of butter. And tears."\n\n"I'm a little busy here! I'm trying to decide what to have for dinner. Oh, how I love to eat. One of my favorite things to do. Go talk to Haskill, he's got more brains than a brain pie! Ooh...brain pie... perfect! ...Care to donate?"\n\n"Wonderful! Time for a celebration... Cheese for everyone! Wait, scratch that. Cheese for no one. That can be just as much of a celebration, if you don't like cheese, true? You've run a maze like a good little rat. But no cheese for you yet. Well, maybe a little."\n\nSheogorath is a riot. He'll keep you coming back trial after trial, just to hear some of his amazing rants. He's easily my favourite Elder Scrolls character.\n\nYou cannot trade between shops to earn income like in Fable, which is unfortunate, but also stops getting the best items early from being too easy. However, with a lot of trading done, you can buy and sell for the exact same price, making late-game adventuriing fill you up with so much cash that you won't have anything to do with it all... except buy more houses and fill them with the rarer spoils of your journeys.\n\nThe map, like I mentioned, is HUGE. the outter map is almost the same exact size as Skyrim, however there are much, much more dungeons and caves to explore. The map is litered with them, all of  them unique in one way or another. I just there were more old forts and ruins with bandits and marauders instead of monsters, vampires and spectral-kind. Finding the correct armour peices can take quite a long time. Needless to say, at the very least this gives you more incetive to explore. Once you finish a dungeon, don't forget about it entirely. Give it a few in-game weeks and the place will be full of new inhabitants, ready to be cleared out of your favourite treasure trove once more.\n\nClass specifications can be a bit... pointless. 90% of the time, unless you are hardcore into RPing, the best class is a Thief-Battlemage-Assassin-Warrior-Illusionist-Bard-Healer. Yeah... lategame you just kind of stop specializing because there is a poor integration for choosing your specific, well-thought custom class. You eventually will just start specializing in everything, rather than being solely a mage or a theif. Because  the game is so unstructured, the only way to get your perfect fantasy is to handicap yourself with strict RP rules.\n\nSpeaking of RP, this game is a goldmine of oppurtunities. I have been streaming my RP playthrough of a theif who uses non-combat magic to get away with his endeavors. Using Invisbility spells to pass by unnoticed, life-detection to know where the enemies are behind walls, and should I run into a pickle, I can dice them up and place them on a hamburger with my dagger fit for Chef Ramsey. (I don't know how Chef would respond to a Argonian Meat Burger, but I'd imagine it would be something like "THIS LIZARD IS SO UNDERCOOKED A SKILLED VETERINARIAN COULD STILL SAVE HIM!") You can live a life as a dashing warrior, a powerful wizard, a simple townsfolk who is secretly the guy murdering all of the beggars and sucking their blood from the neck... you name it, you cann RP it. Except Werewolf. Sorry, Twilight fans, no re-enacting New Moon for you.\n\nOh, and tons of small bugs. Double-equip a scroll that you have multiple of and drop an item. Bam, unlimited gold if you sell them, and duplicates of your favourite decorations.

In an attempt to join in, the two of them started attacking eachother in a duel to the death.\n\nThe next day, the Grey Fox decided to give me his hood for the rest of eternity. Giddy like a child opening their best Christmas gift, I put it on in the middle of town to let the whole world know that I look like the most wanted criminal in the world. 6 guards rushed up to me and said I was under arrest "for everything". Baffled and in the rush of the moment, I killed 5 of them. I then thought to myself, "♥♥♥♥ it's probably the hood". So I took off the hood, and the remaining guard looked at me as if I was his best friend. We had a nice little chat about the Emperor's death, and we went about our business like nothing happened.\n\nI once stumbled upon a cave with a goblin's head on a spike at the entrance. I thought to myself, "I bet there must be some really nice people in here just trying to ward off enemies with that pike outside, maybe I should go inside". So I went invisible, just in case I was somewhere I shouldn't be. It happened to be a nest of vampires, so, as one does, I casually went up to one of them to make conversation. He immediately drew his sword, indicating that he wished to engage in combat with me. I killed him, and went invisible as to avoid any of the others bothering me. I then observed his colleague pass his body. He checked to see that his friend wasn't just sleeping. Realising that he was in fact void of any life, he blurted out "huh, must have been the wind".\n\n10/10 perfect AI, would change absolutely nothing about this game. Best game I have ever played. The story is fantastic, the side quests are genuinely fun and enjoyable, and the DLC adds more to the game that 10 modern DLC packs would to any modern game. This game has aged well, and with mods, can be maintained to modern 'standards' in graphics. I wish games like this were made today, and I cannot wait for Skyblivion (Oblivion remade in the engine that Skyrim uses).\n\nThis game sacrafices a good combat system and sometimes poor environment for a truly perfect questing experience, and an incredibly diverse magic system. There is too many good points to explain in a review, so just buy the f$%&ing game. I played over 2000 hours on the PS3 version, and recently bought it in a Steam sale. Even after all that time spent, this game is still a joy to play and explore. You decide how you want to play it, and how you are percieved by everyone in the world. This is, and will always be, my favourite game of all time.","February 21","true","43.4"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","100","14","14","9","1"

Of all proportion\nThe game will draw you in and take you into its self, it is so immersive and in my opinion the greatest of all role playing games. The feel is so geniune, so original and so magical.. it's like watching a medieval fantasty film from perhaps the seventies.. if you can imagine that and have a splendid feeling, then you must be interested.\nThere is no comparison to this. Absolutley not. It is far too spectacular in its glory for that. Now you must understand that this game brought me into the world of role playing games, my favored genre, for their humming realism and grand feats of imaginative speldour, I got the game of the year edition, and that disk span in my xbox for well over well, my save game had 657 or so days there. I would say around three thousand hours I have played Oblivion.\n\nNow one who has the skill to tell a detailed tale of their adventures in life may do so wonderfully. I belive it would take me much more practice to do enough justice that would suit my liking to this game. I will only ramble on at things that come into my mind.\n\nSo for the overall aestheics... oh man. words really cannot do justice on this. It is something very very special. Now this does give me nostalgia and so I am being biasedly complementary here, I remember the smells of snack food like oranges and the smell of meat and pasta, or any other combination.. and dust.. dust gives me much nostaligia of earlier days. This goes well with the theme, a quite colourful and dainty civilisation, obvious fantasy articles and easy lovely heads up display : ). Please man, if you like, check out a video of some menial gameplay from someone else, to get a feel of what this is like\nI shall get into some gameplay descritions now, (which I must say are not entirely top notch) as I say, you must be imaginitive! That is the magic touch, for me at least.. well they go so well if you add your own self to it :), so they work simply, and add no mess, like they are working real time and are a glance at the world, moving you ever further.\nNow I hope I do not have to tell you what you can do! As with many other games of its kind, you can... go foraging in the forest for example, find fruits & berry leaves for example, and go to a station of which you can work to boil up potions... you can do the vast array as normal, with no taints, no faults.\nI am telling you, this is a super extrodinary game. A pioneer! I suggest that you must own this game, you know there is a balance of, mountains and snow, swamp and rivers, grassy hills with nearby caves, farmland and noble cities.. creatues galore, none out of place or without a story intertwined. The serenity.\nOh my I could call this perfect. I do love it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwasbornintheusa/recommended/22330/","iwasbornintheusa","cherre0","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iwasbornintheusa/","35 products in account","The first time I played Oblivion, I hated it. I thought it had the worst character models of all time, and the combat took too long and felt unnecessarily difficult, I immediately developed the opinion that Skyrim was the best game in every regard. That was probably one of the biggest mistakes I've ever made concerning a video game. The thing about oblivion that makes it the polar opposite of Skyrim is that, the more you play Oblivion, the better it gets. Meanwhile Skyrim is magical at first, and then progressively gets way too easy and tedious. So heres why you need to play Oblivion in 2016:\n1) The combat\nAs mentioned antecedently, Oblivion combat system is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at first, but then, very similarly to Morrowind, you feel yourself getting progressively more powerful. You start as someone less dangerous than a native american toddler with cerebral palsy, but turn into one of the most epic warriors on the face of Tamriel. It also requires more skill, you need to strafe and blocking actually consistently makes a difference in who falls first in an engagement. Although there are no fancy decapitation animations, it still rewards more of a sense of completion, since you know that you have to be powerful to slay this person or creature.\n2) The Story\nOblivions many storylines, particulary the Dark Brotherhoods, blow skyrim out of the water. The characters have so much more depth than, "I came from X and I'm gonna hostile to you now but after one ♥♥♥♥ing quest I'm gonna worship the ground you walk on" They will start to like you more after every few assassinations, depending on how well you perform them, and when its done, you wont just be their favorite warrior, you will be their leader. Same with the main quest, rather than just running around dungeon to dungeon, killing the draugr "boss" at the end. There are many different types of quests within the main storyline, and honestly it feels like a complete movie at a certain point.\n3) The quests\nYou know whats better than having to go into a tunnel fight the draugr minions, fix a puzzle with the directions right in front of you, and have it be the same puzzle every time? EVERYTHING is the answer to that. Oblivion has such a vast arsenal of different variations of quests that it can throw at you, poisoning someones food, chasing a unicorn, etc\n4) The world\nThe final point I'm going to rant about is that the world of Oblivion is more interesting than Skyrims in almost every regard. The people have their own conversations, and the game somehow manages to give personality to all of the random conversations as well. For example, when a nord and an imperial had a conversation, the imperial said, "those nords sure are hostile" and he immediately said goodbye. That sort of discomfort in the face of racism adds so much personality and says alot about the world itself, and the bigotry is hurled in every direction from every direction. It also, despite a weaker engine, still looks prettier, due to its bright colors rather than white and brown.\nBY AZURA BY AZURA BY AZURA","May 23","true","51.3"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","0"

But allow me to explain.\n\n\nSkyrim has the better graphics, better soundtrack, better combat, better ai, yada yada. All the stuff expected from having a better engine.\nWhile vanilla oblivion in itself can offer you a lot:\nA main quest that's of a grander scale as the one in Skyrim.\nFar, far more side quests.\nA plethora of explorable areas.\nActually more in-depth factions, reputations and guilds.\nBetter item distribution and item quality dispersion(when do you get this/that type).\n\nEnfin, the real question is: All that vanilla stuff is great, but it can be modded into skyrim as well!\nWell... Oblivion's mod-database is still far greater than the one skyrim has to offer as of now.\nGraphics and Music can be easily improved, especially in the realm of character textures.\nI'd personally also recommend many of the city overhauls and terrain improvements.\nHowever, the real treats are in the more complex mods. Oblivion has had a far larger amount of time to develop it's mod pool and thus has far more complex mods for whatever tickles your fancies.\n\nIn short: If you're in love with modding your Bethesda games, Oblivion is certainly worth picking up and is easily moddable to your heart's content.\nEven if you're not into modding the game itself holds its own unique charm and well worth experiencing, especially if it happens to go on sale!\n\nSo, hereby answering the request: Oblivion is a must have if you're fan of the TES series, well worth considering if you love modding games, worth a try if you started at skyrim and wondered what events lead to it, and if you're new to Bethesda's TES series a fair point to start.\n\n~Rose","November 30, 2013","true","191.9"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/knubbler/recommended/22330/","knubbler","ChinsForDays","http://steamcommunity.com/id/knubbler/","100 products in account","First off, I have over 300 hours in this game on Xbox so don't be fooled by my low playtime on steam. Secondly the fact that I have over 300 hours should tell you that this game is worth playing, if it isn't enough I break down what makes this such a great game and where its strengths and weaknesses are in this review.\n\nElder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an open world role playing game that emphasizes on player freedom, exploration and creativity.  You play a prisoner of the imperial army who meets the emperor while he is trying to covertly get out of the city when a cult of assassins are killing members of the royal family to wipe out their bloodline. During the games tutorial you get recruited abruptly to help guard the emperor during this escape. Here you will get some insight on how to play the game and how the character progression system works as well as a taste of the lore of the elder scrolls universe. Once this brief but effective tutorial sequence is over you emerge a free man/woman free to do WHATEVER you want.  You can take part of all number of activities and explore the vast province of Cyrodil; you can sink hundreds of hours into this massive very in depth game.\n\nThe things you can do are extensive in Oblivion. There is the main story which is engrossing and varied though a little on the shorter side. There are four guilds you can join complete with their own quest lines which are all fantastic and very interesting with cool characters and feel distinctly different from each other. There is the "Fighters Guild" the "Mages Guild" the "Thieves Guild" and the "Dark Brotherhood". There is also the arena where you engage in gladiator style fights with some of Cyrodil's greatest fighters and most viscous beasts. You can also visit shrines of the various gods in the game and do quests for them, these are some of the best in the game and all are unique and yield cool rewards. There is also a plethora of quest's to do for the citizens of Cyrodil which are amazingly mostly unique and quite fun. There are countless caves, castles, and other locations to find and explore. There are houses through out the game you can buy and decorate ranging from shacks by the water the exquisite manors. Of course you can also spend hours on hours training your character and interacting with all the npc's in the game. The amount of content in this game feels endless and can be binge played all day, day after day with always more content seeming to pop up all over the place.\n\nOblivion takes place in Cyrodil as I mentioned earlier in the review, the central province in the continent of Tamriel. Cyrodil is the seat of imperial power where the Septim bloodline has reigned as emperor for generations. The Septim bloodline has a power, related to the gods themselves and they now face being wiped out by a sinister cult whose motivations are dark and mysterious. The Elder Scrolls series is rich with lore, Bethesda invented gods both "good" and "evil" with personalities and beliefs all unique from each other. The relationships the gods have with mortals are very interesting. You can spend hours reading the various books in the game learning about Tamriels history and learn more about the various groups and their own history, it's insanely extensive.\n\nThe gameplay is an interesting but mixed bag. The graphics look dated, the animations are clunky and the voice cast is extremely small for a world with so many people in it but it's pretty easy to overlook with all the goes right in the game. For combat you can use melee weapons ranging from swords to maces to axes as well as ranged weapons like bows. Magic is also very prominent in combat as well as for utility in the game. Combat is kind of stiff at times but it works fine and is easy to get the hang of. The leveling system is one of the elder scrolls’ biggest strengths and weaknesses simultaneously. You level your character by leveling your skills, these skills vary from "Blade Weapons" too "Lock picking". Leveling you skills increases your overall level, so if you spending all your time leveling utility skills like "Alchemy" and "Athletics" but without leveling your combat skills like "Destruction" magic or "Archery" your character will be poor in combat which will make getting things done difficult. It’s also important to think clearly about what kind of character you want to make, this will determine what skills you should focus on leveling in the early game, once these skills are at an adequate level you can then branch out into other skills that are catch your interest. Leveling up other skills will allow making your character more malleable in different situations. Remember, solving all your problems by swinging an axe into people's heads isn't the best way to handle all situations. Also all the music in the game is fantastic.\n\nIn the end, when you take all the good and the bad together you have an imperfect but very awesome RPG. You can lose all your spare time for a long time with this game, and you will love every minute of it. The two DLC's that the game of the year edition comes with, "Knights of the Nine" and especially "The Shivering Isle's" are fantastic extra content, the latter is one of the best DLC's I have ever played. It's like a whole game in itself almost. This is a fantastic experience and I would recommend it to anybody.\n\n9.5/10","January 5, 2015","true","0.1"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","3"

Its a perfect balance between not holding your hand as much as Skyrim but also occasionally cutting you some slack should you want it. You can still break the game, but its not necessary, its something that you have to want to do.\n\nThe enviornments are beautiful. My personal favorite. Really nice fantasy enviornments with varying flora and fauna and color schemes. When you're in the north sections, it feels cool and then cold and rocky, when you're in the southwest, it feels like warm rolling plains surrounded with flowers, in the east it feels like a trecherous swamp. Imo there isn't a Elder Scrolls game out with more attention to the sheer atmosphere of whatever setting you're in.\n\nCombat isn't anything in depth (it isn't in Skyrim or Morrowind either though, so don't kid yourself), but its all pretty balanced and you can play mostly anything exactly how you'd expect. Do I wish daggers had more backstab damage? Sure. Is conjuration a bit on the strong side? Yep. But if you want to make an archer you can make just an archer. If you just want to punch things, that works too. The game has a really good amount of challenge to me, and doesn't become suddenly easier when you reach a ceartin milestone (as in Morrowind), and doesn't forget to present any challenge unless you really mess up your character (as in Skyrim).\n\nPeople say the game needs mods, but I don't really agree. I would reccomend installing a face overhaul, yeah. Its a rough part of the awkward 2006 graphics era. But other than that the fantasy setting does it well enough where you don't need any hyper realitic immaculate textures in my opinion at least.\n\nSo I dunno what else to say without rambling. I love Morrowind and Skyrim, I really do. But Oblivion will always have a special place in my heart, and if you aren't too diehard devoted the modern luxuries that Skyrim offers, or the somewhat hardcore trpg influenced gameplay that Morrowind has, this is a wonderful game.\n\nAlso; the soundtrack.

There are plenty of items and weapons to collect along the way, not to mention a variety of spells to use which become more advanced further in the game. Like many RPG/Adventure games, you level up once you have exceeded enough xp points. This enables you to customize  your character and how you want to play the game, ex, stealth, melee, ranged or magic. The graphics are amazing with an ace soundtrack.

Maybe one of the greatest game's ever to be released. Made by Bethesda Softworks you can expect alot of bugs. Yet, you will see alot of adventure and interresting dialogue. The game's story is that the gates to Oblivion (AKA hell) has opened in Cyrodill, and you. A prisoner off the Imperial Prison needs to seek a way out off the prison with the Emperor, and also find the last heir to him and shut close the jaws of oblivion. The game has a great atmosphere and it has alot of enjoyable colors aswell. The areas are simply beautfull, you always feel the need to explore the open world and also help the people around you when you actually listen to all their problems.\n\nWhen playing you will see alot of NPC's, some NPC's will only be talkable during quests or guilds. Or they might have a quest or just be people that are there to fill the area. There is about four guilds in the game, following the Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Mage's College/Mage's Guild, and ofcourse Fighters Guild.\n\nThe story off the Dark Brotherhood is that you have just been spyed on by a man when you have killed a innocent, he will tell you to kill a man (Not saying due to spoilers) when you have done so you are invited. But to the guild you will be nothing but just a new member. You do quests to advance and aqually mean something in the guild.\n\nThe Thieves Guild is similiar to the Dark Brotherhood in the sneaking aspect. But you can't kill people as that gives you a boun ty. The story follows: You have been thrown in jail, the people off the thieves guild take you as a criminal now and has given you a chance to join the group. You start off as a normal low ranked member, not being of much use, but it will change when you become a higher rank.\n\nThe story of the Mage's Guild is self explanatory. Mage's Against some evil people. This guild is the most boring one in my opinion, but if you're playing  a mage I recommend this guild.\n\nThe Fighter's Guild, this one is very mixed for me... it didn't have much for a story except for stop that guy, do that, stop that guy. But was still very interesting and had alot of fun moments.\n\nOverall, the Elder Scrolls: Oblivion in the ends turns out as a great adventure game with alot off challenge and alot of fun, you will spend about possibly even 90 hours trying to complete everything or less if you just wanna finish the story, but then you're just missing out off the actual game. As the game is very good and still has quite decent graphics compared to some games. I give this game a 9.5 out of 10 due to how it was made and how much there is to do. The graphics aren't the greatest but are actually quite decent. This game is very recommended from me if you like adventure and RPG mashed togheter.","December 6, 2013","true","135.4"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It features very well designed quests and far more improved combat. With a world that is full of color, and a wide assortment of locations. From snowy plateaus to sandy beaches filled with twitchy Argonians.\n\nAt the same time the game is still flawed. It's a game that hasn't aged very well graphically, and the RPG elements are very hamfisted and lacking. There are thankfully mods that fix all of this, and I don't recommend playing this game vanilla. If you do, all you'll find is a game filled with potato people. One where you are legitimately stronger at the beginning of the game due to how badly coded the levelling system is.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=303467106","January 3, 2014","true","48.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","4"

Fast-forward to 2011 when i got my copy of Skyrim i found that i was able to play an Elder Scrolls game, and i found it to be one of the best games i have ever played, and went well over the 300 hours of gameplay estimated for the game.\n\nAfter playing Skyrim i chose to play Oblivion again, and i loved it. After having a bit of knowledge on the lore and the way Elder Scrolls games worked i found that the world of Tamriel became a more interesting, and definitely beautiful place, but i never did complete Oblivion until today on the PC. (18/10/2014)\n\nI can tell that Cyrodiil is very much based on England, or countries alike; with the vast and beautiful forests to explore to the rolling fields and meadows of County Skingrad and The West Weald, i felt like i had taken a journey back in time to the days of Albion, where tales of magic, dragons and heros were told in regular supply. The experience of delving into the past in Ancient Ayleid Ruins was exciting and jumpy, and all the more rewarding once you come out with a good bit of loot, gold, and tons of welkynd stones... maybe too many, but aside from the visuals and personal experience, i found the story to be very much like the fantasy stories of gold, and i cannot believe i never took the time to follow the main storyline before, but alas, i have now completed it.\n\nThere are a few letdowns however, one being the lack of variety in voices for NPCs, and the very static movement of the animations for the game. I admit this was made back in 2005 and was BGS' second major 3D game, i think, but it made the game quite immersion breaking at times, and nobody would want to be pulled out of this amazing world. Speaking of voice acting, there were times where the voice acting for certain characters were not on par with the voice acting of the regular NPCs, and i found this to be disappointing with the amount of quality this game tries to bring to the table.\n\nGraphically this game has a very artistic feel to it, for where it wants to be as realistic as possible, it still has a sense of handmade effort in the visuals that gives what you see value, because the world of Cyrodiil is like looking at a painting: a true masterpiece.\n\nSo my final rating for this game is a very strong 9.2/10\n\nBefore entering the world of Tamriel, i recommend looking up on some of the lore, i would recommend ShoddyCast on YouTube with it's lore series, but this game, and Skyrim, are a definite purchase.","October 18, 2014","true","60.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

This game series defined what a fantasy world should be like and is the foundation of any good fantasy RPG. Though it seems old to many young gamers, this game is a must have for any gamer that loves fantasy settings.\n\nEach race in Oblivion has its own strengths and weaknesses, greatly defining each race and seperating them from everyone else. For instance, Bretons (A race in Oblivion) can wield powerful magics and start off with more magical energies than other races, though they are weaker than most. Khajit can sneak around more easily and can use their claws as weapons to hurt their foes.\n\nThere are many different classes in this game, each one serving a certain role. Do you want a warrior who also uses magic? Or would you rather prefer and rouge that uses illusions to hide his tracks as he steals jewels? If you don't like any of the classes, there is an option where you can create your own class, tailoring it to your own needs and wants. Combining a magic wielding class with a race that specilizes in certain classes of magics will allow you to become the greatest mage in the world or creating a two handed wielding orc to become the most feared barbarian in the lands.\n\nAnd the fun doesn't stop there, each adventure is more interesting than the last. One play through may have you encounter a door to Oblivion where you must close the door before more demons pour through. Another play through may have you collect a strange weed with mystical powers. No play through is ever the same.\n\nIf you haven't played Oblivion and you are interested in Fantasy Settings, then Oblivion is a must have in your library.\n\n","November 26, 2013","true","41.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

This time it is set in Cyrodiil, the Imperial Province of lush forests, snowy mountain caps and dark swamps, all to be explored at will. There are nine major cities, Anvil, Kvatch, Skingrad, Chorral, Bravil, Leyawin, Bruma, Cheydinhal and the Imperial City, plus many other minor settlements, temples, farms etc.\n\nRight at after character creation, you are taken by the Emporers guards on an escape from the palace dungeons, before he tasks you with delivering the Amulet of Kings and shutting closed the jaws of Oblivion. From then on you have the entire province to explore at your own will. You can join guilds such as the fighters guild, basically the legal vigilanties of Tamriel, the mages guild, who are basically the wizards of the empire, the thieves guild, which is an illegal guild of robbers and thieves, the dark brotherhood, who are the spiritual assassins who worship Sithis and the Night Mother, and the Arena, which is pretty self explanetory.\n\nA good understanding of TES lore is recommended, and will always make the game feel more real. I recommend this series to bring you up to speed. https://www.youtube.com/user/ShoddyCast It will inform you on the many races, religions, provinces and more that exist on Nirn (It also explains what Nirn is). Or you could read the many ingame books as an alternative.\n\nThe only downsides I can think of is the chat system, which is a little outdated, and the stupid essential NPCs. Unforunatly they removed Morrowinds 'you can kill anyone, as long as you can deal with the consequences' system in favor of appeal to casual gamers. These don't damage the overall game too much, however.\n\n9.1/10","September 10, 2014","true","96.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

But instead of being 'The Chosen One', youre just some guy through the entire game that just happened to be in the wrong place at the right time. You get released from prison and walk around doing whatever you want. Theres not many side quests like Skyrim has as you can beat the entire game fairly quickly. And unlike Skyrim, some of the best weapons you get yo have to spend a 3 month hike trying to find and then when you do get it, oh boy, its life changing.\n\nIf you've played Skyrim and enjoyed it, then play this and enjoy a real game.

The world (called Cyrodiil)  has multiple regions of landscape, all giving you a taste of wildlife and roleplaying elements, like old, swampy caves or a great fort in the uplands of Colovia. Everywhere you go you can interact with the environment, from plants and mushrooms to animals and NPCs.\n\nWhen you open the grate out of the sewer for the first time you realise the immense beauty of lake rumare, but thats the tip of the iceberg. You could if you wish, follow the main quest, and complete it how the developers thought it would be like. Or you can find your own path venture into an unknown cave, or explore the Imperial City's marketplace and see what it has to offer.\n\nThe game has oppertunities to be each class as you will, and a race to go along with it. You could be a High Elf Mage, the Arch-Mage of the Arcane University, or a Nordic Warrior, leader of the Fighters guild. There is a great range of quests to complete and level up your character. You may want to find certain items and loot dungeons to find them, while selling what else you find.\n\nThe Shivering Isle DLC, lets Sheogorath the Daedric Prince of Madness invite you to his realm, where everything is run a whole lot differently. The Knights of Nine DLC sends you on an epic quest, to defeat Umaril, who threatens Cyrodiil, while worshipping the Nine Divines. Depending on which pack you brought, one edition will come with four DLC houses, each with their own quest, and some other miscellaneous DLC.\n\nSo go explore Cyrodiil in all its glory. Be a Warrior, or a Thief, or a Mage or even all of them together!

Radiant AI makes the game feel much more alive than previous Elder Scrolls installments.  The Dark Brotherhood faction remains the single most intruiging questline I have ever played in a game.  You will hear npcs telling rumors of events that you yourself participated in, making you feel that your actions have had some impact in the world.    The Shivering Isles expansion that comes with this game is probably the best DLC I have ever played.  It is arguably a tighter experience than the base game.  Morrowind fans will likely experience a bit of nostalgia from the alien landscapes featured.  This game's only real problem is that everything that it tries to do doesn't always work as intended.  This is most obvious with how npcs interact both with you, and with each other.  You can have a perfectly pleasant conversation with an npc, only for him to tell you to shut up and leave him alone when you say your goodbyes.  While this is oftentimes comical, it is also immersion breaking, which is a bit hit for a game whose biggest draw is making you feel like an inhabitant in a living world.  Also, dungeons can feel a little repetitive, as designs are often reused.  It's hard to have every dungeon feel unique when there are so many of them in the game, but I would still expect a bit more variety than what we got.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys rpgs or open world games.  The amount of solid content you're getting for 20 dollars or less is incredible, and should not be passed up.","February 9, 2015","true","60.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

A friend of my older brother had let us borrow a handful of games for the 360, and this was one of them. While my brother didn't touch it, I took the leap and tried it out. It was love at first sight.\n\nAnd I'm 99% sure that I never gave it back to the guy.\n\nAnyways, everyone looking at this game is probably comparing it against Skyrim: which should I buy?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/folcro/recommended/22330/","folcro","Folcro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/folcro/","562 products in account","Fresh off the boat from Vvardenfell, I was hard on Oblivion early on. It's appropriate to compare the two games, but not as closely as I did. And while I still got far more hours and enjoyment out of Morrowind, there was a depth of charm to its successor that I had long overlooked.\n\nOn a technical level, I find little opposition that Oblivion broke new ground in making such a big world function as well as it did. The employment of Bethesda's new "Radiant AI" served as a welcome relief to the NPCs of Morrowind, whose highlight of day-to-day activity was walking twenty steps to the left. While there were aspects of this innovation that Skyrim would later improve upon, it was awesome to see the people around me wake up, go to work, go to the tavern, go hunting, eat, sleep, pray. Population centers felt alive and I started to feel the community instead of trusting that it was there.\n\nVoice acting was another... "improvement." You didn't have to read large blocks of text anymore because God forbid. Bethesda boasted that dialogue took up half of the game's data with over two full days of voice recording.\n\nWhen I first learned this, I felt reluctant. I feared that no matter how much voice acting one is willing to pack onto a DVD, there isn't enough time or money to capture the alluring exposition of Morrowind, the details of the relationships and backstories; no voice actor Bethesda got their hands on could hope to capture what I imagined when I spoke to a Telvanni lord.\n\nWell, I was right. Long, detailed information was butchered, mainstreamed. There were hardly any topics to discuss, and I didn't feel like I could have a true conversation with anyone the game didn't deem important enough. Talking to a random bystander about their trade not only developed a character, but the world. I didn't have that anymore. Every gender of each race (for the most part) had not only the same voice, but the same speech. It was almost silly. With the big step forward in immersion with Radiant AI and voice acting, it was a shame to take such a step back in what was perhaps my favorite aspect of Oblivion's predecessor.\n\nI also had mixed feelings about the induction of fast travel. I let it go; if I wanted the immersion, I could always refuse it (even though I knew any such commitments wouldn't last). Looking on the bright side, I could enjoy completing quests and keeping the story going. Returning instantly to the doorstep of my favorite places would help me savor and rediscover them, when before I might have put it off for dread of the trek until I was too powerful to care. So, while I will always appreciate the punishing journeys of Morowind, I suppose I can mark fast travel as a net positive.\n\nAnd they finally added horses to make travelling faster!\n\nUm... okay. Maybe they would provide some other combat or burden benefit?\n\nNo. Not really. So, uh... moving on.\n\nThe graphics are beautiful. Stunning. I was impulsively critical of the "normality" of the setting compared to Vvardenfell. Yes, Cyrodiil is more familiar, but in hindsight I don't see why I should have trouble accepting that this particular part of a much larger and dynamic fantasy world is simply inspired by Medieval Europe like many other works of fantasy whose familiarity I forgave, even welcomed.\n\nMaybe it's because I expect more from a game, maybe it's because the story left me wanting (which it did, but it's not that simple--- more on that shortly). The vistas of Cyrodiil ran unrivalled in gaming at the time, and few with today's technology can match its brilliance, especially when considering how interactive and detailed every yard of it is. Now, Dagon's plane of Oblivion, for which the game is named, that's where I stop defending the lack of inovation: classic Dante. And Daedric architecture was, altogether now, far more intriguing in Morrowind.\n\nJust as Oblivions's landscapes hold up today, the general facial designs of NPCs were subpar even then (aside from the beast folk, but then I resented that they were streamlined to equip footwear).\n\nBut where did Oblivion shine? Where did Oblivion not only stand up to Morrowind but arguably surpass it?\n\nThe faction questlines.\n\nThe main questline was not very interesting (still blows away Skyrim), though it managed to turn out a few likeable characters (Baurus, Martin, uh... Jauffre was okay, I guess). But the faction quests were truly the greatest strength of a solid game. Morrowind's were less linear, giving players the choice of advancing through work in different parts of the map (the superior concept, in my opinion); Oblivion allowed a single path, but not only provided a heavier narrative, they gave the feeling that you were part of something. Both systems have their strengths and weaknesses, but Oblivion's Mages Guild combined the two...\n\nYou had to impress the leader of each installment of the Mage's Guild, each with their own personality, style, and agenda, much like Morrowind. Once they are in agreement, you're rewarded with access to the previously locked mechanic of magic-making and enchanting in a place that felt like a functioning school. There, you work your way from grunt to archmage in a series of quests that begin benign but gradually rise in importance to the finale. Was it perfect? No. But the structure and pacing brought the experience to life for me. I enjoyed every quest.\n\nIn terms of story, the best of Oblivion (and the series as of Skyrim) was the Dark Brotherhood. The characters, the atmosphere, the plot and the individual quests were beautiful. Sometimes it felt like a different game entirely. I'll never forget when it was all coming to a head, I stepped out of a lighthouse and the brutal, depressing scene it housed, and spent a quiet moment watching the sun break the horizon over the sea, uncertain of the future. It was magnificent.\n\nThe Thieves' Guild came close to the mages guild in terms of structure, and close to the Dark Brotherhood in terms of story: a well-balanced and enjoyable adventure.\n\nOblivion's factions set the bar, and I couldn't wait to see what Skyrim... well, we'll get to that another time.\n\nFinally, on to combat. Yes, it's more fun to swing a sword when the sword is going to hit its target, and the employment of modern physics made it satisfying to knock your enemy over a table with a deathblow to the face. What's more, Oblivion did what I would have sworn was impossible: it made magic even more useless than it was in Morrowind (at least then you could cast offensive spells through items--- laughably overpowered, but I loved it).\n\nWhen Bethesda made Oblivion, they set out to build a whole new game from the ground up. As to be expected, there were changes that I liked, changes that I didn't. Did Oblivion stand up to Morrowind? I think not, but given the style of its development, it didn't have to. I can't help but respect Bethesda's willingness to drop all their assets and start anew. While Oblivion belongs to a series, it belongs to its own part of the series, just as Cyrodiil itself lies as its own little world in widely-varied Tamriel, and in ways neither can nor should be compared to the others.\n\nIn the end, we need to be realistic: how many games lie outside Bethesda's world so big, where no matter which road you choose, whether you take a road at all, you know you're going to find something worth seeing? That is the marvel of Bethesda, the greatest RPG developer there is.","August 27, 2015","true","208.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

This TES epic was the bane of my existence on xbox and I racked up more than 100 hours just trying undo the vamprisim - at the time, I had very little college, no job and no internet. Oblivion was the perfect game to eat up all the extra time, sometimes spending 12+ hours on a day (without DLC) - The GOTY is worth every penny, I haven't even scraped the surface but now with work, relationships and animals to look after, my oblivion days are very limited.\n\nIf you've never played a TES game, get the ♥♥♥♥ out and do so now! Oblivion has all the ingredients of a perfect RPG you can just sit back, smoke a joint and binge to high hell on for many, many weeks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NykkiJo/recommended/22330/","NykkiJo","Nykki Jo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NykkiJo/","89 products in account","Although I may view other games as being objectively better, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is the single-player game I will always go back to. It is more than a game to me. I view it as true Post-Modern art and something of a lifestyle choice.\n\nBethesda tried to recreate little parts of reality in the interactions between customized NPCs and their scheduled AI. They failed horribly and created instead listless deformed humanoids that lack the intelligence to do little more than bump into one another and echo the same conversation they heard from their previous collision. They lack the social awareness not to steal apples in front of a crowd of guards, nonchalantly stumble over corpses in the town square, or calmly approach a man wearing the recently murdered Emperor's robes.\n\nThese NPCs do not resemble human beings at all, questionably apart from their character models. They are insane, compulsive, and often ghoulish creatures. (Searching through random NPC houses will commonly unearth dead bodies, Dread Father shrines, and other signs of repulsive activity.) It is inspiring in a way to see a thing so close yet so distant in reference to human society.\n\nBethesda realized all of this in a moment of unbearably historic revelation and started work on the game that marks their Self-Actualization -- Shivering Isles. The people of Sheogorath's realm, the Shivering Isles, are each driven mad and suffer from individualistic fixations. Creating a society of manic and demented people is precisely what Bethesda was meant to do with their perfect skillset of brilliant writing, AI that requires specific targets and times, awkward character animations, and ugly models. Instead of accidently creating a weird RPG, they intentionally directed their labor to the highest-valued function. Shivering Isles is absolutely entertaining to explore as a result. Also, Wes Johnson's Sheogorath leaves such an impression on me.\n\nAs a whole, there is an impossible amount of content to experience. For nearly 10 years of consistent play, every new game has revealed new quests (some that don't appear in the journal) that I somehow missed. The quests are consistently hilarious and even have expanded my vocabulary. Exploring is vastly rewarding, as you can discover schedules, backgrounds, and dark secrets of NPCs. There are a fair amount of treasure and unique items hidden about the world, as well. (This is unlike Skyrim's limited content that ends in repeating quests and NPCs that reveal all there is to know about themselves in 20 minutes of town dialogue.) As the NPCs have priority-based AI, they will often interact with one another in surprising ways and result in laugh riots. The dungeons are cookie-cutter and rumors are oft repeated. The combat is stupid, but if you are playing Oblivion for the combat...(LOL). The clothes and armor are not as pretty and differentiated as Morrowind's, but you can still make a few cute outfits. If any of Oblivion's shortcomings bother you that much, though, you can mod the game. ;)\n\nI unfortunately lost my disc 1 while moving, so I repurchased Oblivion on Steam recently. Thus far, this edition works properly on my Windows 7 and comes with Shivering Isles and the objectively trash Knights of the Nine thing. I finished KotN in one brief sitting, had no use for the rewards at my level (like 30), and was rather bored throughout. That's fine, tho', because Shivering Isles alone is worth the MSRP of this product. Heck, even just the soundtrack is worth the MSRP.","July 25, 2015","true","322.4"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sagerz/recommended/22330/","sagerz","Sagerz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sagerz/","78 products in account","I cannot even begin to explain the massiveness of this game.  Very much like Skyrim it is completely open world, RPG brilliance.  From the very start the choices you make, and quests you complete start to define your character for the hero they will become.  Right off the bat i am going to give this game a 9/10.\n\nStory:  Oblivions story is centralized around the idea that Tamriel is in chaos because the emperor was mmurdered, and without a new emperor to light the dragonfires cyrodill will fall into darkness.  In addition to this massive panic towards the death of the emperor, Oblivion gates (Virtually gates to hell) start opening up all across the province.  It is your job to go in and destroy these gates, and crown the new emperor for Cyrodill.\n\nFactions:  I have to say that this is possibly one of the best faction systems in any game.  contrasted only by Skyrim.  The way it is set up allows for multiple factions at once, and allow you to become the almighty ruler of them all.  The factions are: Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, and The Arena, other lower end factions also exist but these are the ones with the most quests involved.  Each of these has a seperate unique storyline that from time to time will also cross into other factions.  Quite revelating.\n\nVisual Appeal:  My computer has an I5 processor and was able to handle almost everything on completely high res (with the exception of shadows and sometimes water), but with that in mind, and the fact that this game was released in 2006...8 YEARS OLD, its still incredibly beautiful!!  The view of the landscape that tranistions from Grasslands, to forests, to the jerall mountains, to the swampy regions of Leyawiin...Takes my breath away.  Though other Elder Scrolls games primarily focused on one regions appeal, morrowind to swamp, and skyrim more to snow, this game perfectly incorporated all regions as it was central bound.\n\nGameplay:  This games main focus revolves around classes that fight in unique way, while also simaltaneously questing.  These mechanics are very strikingly similar to the Legend of Zelda, and if you have ever played a Zelda game, you know perfectly well how exquisetly it accomplishes this.  There are three basic classes, warrior, mage, and thief.  All three of these have their attriubtes, but the remarkable thing about this game is that you can freely choose what you want!  Though choosing your base class at the beginning with determine what skills you are more adept at, you are still able to combine any skills with any other skills.  If you want to be a battleaxe wielding, light armored elf with excellent conjuration skills. You are able to do that no problem.  This system allows you to perfectly mould out your character to what you feel would suit you best.\n\nQuests:  If you do somehow manage to beat all quests in the game, then sir i owe you a gold medal.  If i recall correctly i believe there are around 500 quests in the game to do.  Which some can be completed by simply delivering a package, while others like the main quest will make you toy around for 10 hours before being completed.  The multitude of quests in this game is astounding, and will have your interest hooked for the long haul.\n\nFinal Impressions:  Oblivion is by far my favorite fantasy game of all time let alone my actual favorite game of all time.  I personally own about 5 different versions of the game because of my love for it.  Though it says on my steam profile i only have 9 hours on PC, i had approximately 50 hours on my other steam account, and on xbox...i would be baffled if it said anything less than 600.  This game has a deep connection with me because of Bethesdas brilliance to bring forth such a revolutionary game such as this one.  Even if this genre is something you cant see yourself getting into, i challenge you to play at least the tutorial, join a single faction, and kill a baddie or two and tell me it hasnt captured your interest like it did mine.  In conclusion this is an amazing game and a must buy for every person who has steam.\n\n","October 4, 2014","true","44.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Many people would ask, Should I get (or still get) the Elder Scrolls IV? Of course.\n\nOblivion is well known for its scenery, extensive side questlines, and a remarkable story. The game has aged and its skill system will make newcomers rage (the skill system is mediocre at best, but it not really good). Oblivion was one of the first role-playing game that I've purchased for the Xbox 360 back in 2006. The game was really popular back then with so much things to do. Spend hours exploring caves and dungeons. Become the Grand Champion in the Imperial Arena. Become the Grandmaster for the Mages Guild, the Leader of the Fighters Guild, the Master of Thieves for the Thieves Guild. Each character you encounter would have a unique personality and would have a quest for you to do. The soundtrack for the game is absolutely the best and it would make you just sit and relax just to listen. There are varieties of environments in the game, ranging from the spring-like setting, the pouring rain in the southern side of the map, to the blistering cold in Northern Cyrodiil. If the setting of Skyim makes you a bit..."dull" (meaning that you are tired of playing  the dominated wintery and snowy map of Skyrim), you can come back to Oblivion where all kinds of weather is featured in one game. Like other Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion should be in your gaming library. For gamers that had played Oblivion before, its time to return to Cyrodiil.","December 2, 2014","true","39.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Released in 2006, that was the year before I graduated high school and attempted college. I played it to death and back on the Xbox, probably netting a few hundred hours. I remember getting the manual and reading it in class, like it was any other textbook.\n\nNow I've recently returned to it, several years later with an improved computer and modding capabilities and it does breathe some life into the game. While I can agree that Oblivion, by itself, has not aged well... It helps to mod it up to increase resolution, textures, and getting a mod to make everyone's faces look a lot more... normal. Doing all of that, it's like coming back to an old (but prettier) friend.\n\nShivering Isles also continues to be a fairly fun expansion to play through. With two whole armor sets to work towards, dungeons with great loot, and a main quest that is extremely rewarding in terms of magical powers and loot, it's great to play through once more. (Incidentally, SI is also the most stable part of the game. Not a single Crash-to-Desktop or bug to be found while I was running around the Isles. Perhaps I was lucky, but perhaps the expansion just runs that well).\n\nI can understand how newer aged gamers may not care for the game too much... But Oblivion is worth exploring for some retroactive nostalgia if you started this franchise with Skyrim. Play this, and I'd also recommend Morrowind while you're at it.\nHappy gaming!","October 3, 2015","true","54.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

My older cousin was playing it, and after only 20 minutes of running around as his character, I was utterly hooked. I was about...16 years old? Perhaps younger?\nThe game itself is, for it's time, revolutionary, and it pioneered an entirely new kind of open world RPG, with 'no' invicible walls except for the required ones to put a limit on the generated world. Other then that, every door, was accessible somehow, and every plot of land was reachable. There was not a direction you could not go in Oblivion, and as an RPG, that made it priceless.\nThe game also hosts rather higher tier voice acting. For example, Patrick Stewart(Also famous for starring as Xavier in X-Men, and Captain Jean Luc Picard in Star Trek: The Next Generation), lays voice to the majestic Emperor Uriel Septim, whom you meet during the tutorial of the game.\nThe game, for customization, offers an impressive array of possibilities, with multiple races, hair styles, and direct face molding sliders to make you look truly unique(Or outright silly). It also offers a believably long winded skill system that permits you to become more talented in certain professions and skills as you perform them.\nAs with most Bethesda developped games, Oblivions Engine is uniquely compatible with 3rd party Modification software, allowing Mesh, Animation, and Scripting artists etc. to work almost entirely independantly in the game, limited only by the game's graphical capabilities, and their own imagination. The amount of modifications(Or mods) released for Oblivion, is vast, but has since been passed by its successor; The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim(I should mention that Oblivion by storyline standards, happens 400 years before Skyrim does, and takes place in the Tamrielian province of Cyrodil, the homeland of the Imperials)\nSome individuals will argue that Oblivion is unplayable without mods, but I must say, Oblivion is one of the only games released by Bethesda that is truly a remarkable, fulfilled, well thought out and extremely precisely and expertly executed video game that by no means requires mods to be playable.\nOn a scale of 10 hearts? I give Oblivion an 8.5 hearts. The game's higher tier voice actors, coupled with its engaging story, and the impressive free roam oppertunity, the large cult following and the engaging, high quality modding community, this game is, in on itself, a culture, and I would dare to say that you cannot call yourself a gamer without having walked the adventure filled, dangerously beautiful landscapes of Tamriel, and its many unique provinces.\n","January 20, 2014","true","0.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

If you're considering purchasing this, have a read and see what you think before doing so!\n\nPositives:\n\n+ Pleasant graphics for a game almost a decade old (2006).\n+ A huge assortment of quest to complete, such as the Thieves' Guild, Dark Brotherhood, Fighter's Guild, Mage's Guild and Daedric God storylines. Lots of miscellaneous quests too.\n+ Massive map to explore, lots of locations including caves, bandit camps, forts and ancient ayleid ruins. Snowy regions and lush forest, open grasslands and swamps, very varied terrain.\n+ Wide array of weaponry, many, many skills to level up, use magic, archery or melee combat to strike down foes. Mix your own potions with alchemy, become a master of acrobatics or conjure powerful beasts to do your bidding.\n+ Hundreds of hours of gameplay to engage in. Fun for the first 100-120. Anything in excess of level 40 starts to see boredom set in. I recommend taking regular breaks to avoid the repetition, in which case it won't be so noticeable.\n+ Large mod community.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Extremely flawed and stupid monster levelling, giving you no sense accomplishment when you progress to higher levels. Many creatures will be levelled to you, meaning that, at higher levels, you'll be required to spam click attacks for ages to get kills (ogres, goblin warlords, gloom wraiths). Keep in mind this is using the best weapons available, with the highest skill level. Much to your disdain, you'll spend hours clearing out caves or forts filled with insanely high hitpoint enemies. Not fun, not a challenge, just a complete and utter waste of time.\n- Caves, dungeons and other places have a lot of loot potential and you'll have fun in the beginning collecting fragments of armour, potions and gold to pay for adventuring supplies and purchasing houses. However, after awhile there's literally nothing to spend your cash on. All of the equipment I've sold has resulted in stockpiling over 300,000 coins, with nothing practical to spend it on. Every elder scrolls (even the latest instalment to the series, Skyrim) has had this issue.\n\n- Dumb AI that gets stuck when you jump onto rocks and cast magic or shoot arrows. It doesn't understand how to reach you. The AI scripting for conversations is also ridiculous. There are only a limited number of discussions citizens can have between each other and these all feel very, very unnatural. It's as if the designers didn't bother to implement realistic dialogue.\n- Many textures for forts or caves are re-used and do not look unique. This gets dull later, rather than sooner, but it's still a great downfall of the title. The layouts of many locations are similar. They might have different pathways, include an underwater cave or a bridge, but for all intents and purposes, most locations have a familiar feel to them. There's little excitement in that regard.\n- Modding requires excessive use of complicated tools that are not only time consuming but annoying. Not to mention the countless glitches that conflict with gameplay.\n- Character levelling comes to a sudden halt around levels 40+, it becomes so infrequent that you feel like you're achieving nothing at all, apart from going on errands for a number of characters you don't care much about.\n\nThe Shivering Isles Expansion:\n\nPositives:\n\n+ New textures compared to the base game, an entirely new environment, new colours, new armour and weapons, new characters, new monsters and new quests. Consequently, this expansion does have a feeling of freshness to it.\n+Around 30 hours of additional content, which is not unreasonable for an expansion.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Despite the fact that there are various changes and new features, the dreadful monster levelling system remains, which never fails to detract greatly from the experience (unless you go to the Shivering Isles at a lower level, at which point it becomes bearable).\n- Rather horrible voice acting for Sheogorath, too try-hard in its approach, quite off-putting and didn't seem like a genuine portrayal of the characteristics the developers wanted to exhibit, which was a God of Madness.\n\nKnights of the Nine Expansion:\n\n+ A new and intriguing storyline (for the most part) based around the Nine Divines, where you must complete a series of tests to retrieve the ancient armour of Crusader Pelinal Whitestrake, in an effort to defeat the infamous Umaril, a Daedra who poses a threat to Cyrodiil.\n+ Some extra locations to explore which have been added to the map during the expansion, but nothing really new other than aesthetics (the Crusader armour and weapons).\n+ There's a real feeling of reviving the old Knights of the Nine Order, as people will approach you to swear their allegiance. You'll fight side by side at the end against Umaril's minions in a big battle, which is cool.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Many of the places you'll visit are filled with the standard enemies you'll encounter in the base game, there is little difference in the design of these locations to other ayleid ruins or forts in the base game as well.\n\nDLC Add-Ons\n\nPositives:\n\n+ A number of new houses for those interested. There's a Wizard's Tower, a Castle and an underground Cave that can become new homes, some of them include enchanting and spellmaking areas for convenience.\n+ A few additional activities to partake in, like collecting dwarven artifacts stolen by bandits, to repair an Orrery at the Arcane University. You can also investigate the caverns beneath anvil to find the resting place of a pirate ship and the mystery behind it. In the East of Cyrodiil you can travel to Sundercliff Watch, a fortress that holds the powerful Daedric item, Mehrune's Razor.\n\nNegatives:\n\n- Some bugs which interfere with how the house DLC works, causing problems with them being unable to be purchased or relevant questlines not progressing.\n\nOverall Score: 7.5/10\n\nThe Elder Scrolls: IV Oblivion is almost a decade old as of 2015. It's still a very entertaining and fun game, but one should also be aware of the numerous problems it has. Worth picking up on sale for under $10.","March 8, 2015","true","149.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It has good enough graphics and a good story, with well-done guild missions and beautiful cities. Oblivion also has one of my favorite soundtracks, with music style changing based on where you go or who you meet. There is a lot to explore, such as Shivering Isles, and even more with mods. These add up to create very memorable moments; however, like all games, there are problems. The outdoor areas in this game are usually extremely bland and boring, making exploration repetitive after a few hours. You will not see all the varied landscapes such as in Skyrim, each one hand-crafted and beautiful. The enemies level up as you do, so you will not find rewards by leveling up. When you are level 5, bandits may have weak armor and weapons; when you are level 20, they have tough armor and good weapons. You will find them in very formulated patterns, such as when you walk along a trail and see each enemy standing the same distance away from each other, each one standing motionless in the middle of the trail. This makes the game feel less realistic. That leads me to the game's biggest fault; the combat. Combat is literally bonkers compared to Skyrim. Enemies soak arrows and take hits like a sponge. In Skyrim, I could take down an enemy fairly quickly by sneaking behind them and slitting their throat, I could take someone down with a few arrows, and I could kill with a few hits of a sword. In Oblivion, I can recall shooting about ebony twenty arrows (at least) from an ebony bow into a bear until it finally died. It took about 15 ebony arrows from an ebony bow and 10 flare spells (very weak) to kill a bandit. However, it is easy to enjoy the game while acknowledging these faults. Don't think the bad outweighs the good, because it doesn't. Oblivion is a great game, and if it had a good leveling system, combat, and hand-crafted environments, it would be the best Elder Scrolls game.","June 8, 2014","true","167.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

I'm so glad it's available here. No more scratched discs.\n\nYou can't go wrong with a title that inludes "The Elder Scrolls," well, unless they put "Online" after it, but that's another story. The Elder Scrolls games are deep, rich RPGs with so much to do you can get lost in them for weeks of real time and forget the outside world exists. I find myself using terms and quotes from this game when I am forced into real life, hoping, desperately to find others like myself. If you do something to anger me? "Hope you rot, criminal scum!"\n\nThere was a girl who suggested I play the previous Elder Scrolls game. She gave me a wonderful gift. I forget her name. I forget everything that happend after I got it installed. "Another satisfied customer."\n\nThis is a true roleplaying game in that it lets you be whomever you wish, advance in whatever skills you like and live however you want. Go play the main quest, help the people out or just ignore all that and explore, find your own path. No one is going to force you to save the empire. Don't want to be a grand hero? Fine. How about becoming a thief instead? Perhaps you'd like to gather exotic ingredients and make powerful potions to try on people or even sell. Become a master mage or a truly accomplished assasin. Either way, make your mother proud.\n\nThere's so much content I am incapable of writing intelligibly about it (or some would claim anything else). There are many races of people and humaoid creatures you can play. There's a full political game, crime awarness and punishment, people to impress or alienate, and a kingdom to save or doom. I'm sure others have written about all that.\n\nIf you haven't guessed, I'm a fan, big-time. This is perhaps the best money I ever spent on Steam. I mean, if I calculate what i spent on every edition I have ever owned and divide by the number of enchanted hours I played, it would come down to less than a penny an hour to be absolutely delighted. Did I mention I like the game?\n\nThe selection of weapons, armor, people, places and things to do is dizzying. As I said, I've played it thousands of hours before I bought it on Steam and I've never felt I've explored the entire game. I would MUCH rather go back and play it some more than write a decent review of it. There are currently 27,787 user-created MODs for this game on just one website, adding even more to the game. This makes the game infinately replayable. It also means a LOT of other people love it so much they made their own stuff to place in the game. Adding MODs to this game is very easy and extremely fun.\n\nI saw something about dated graphics, but here's where it gets good. There is a HUGE modding community that has not only added characters, quests, locations, and everything else conceivable to the game, but they have visual and sound creations to bring the dated game to modern standards.  I am delighted to announce that this game runs better than ever in 2016 in Windows 10. You can make it look and sound more wonderful than when it first shipped, back when it enslaved us in the greatest addiction of our lives.\n\nOkay, so I started the game in a dank, stinking prison cell. Wait. I thought this was supposed to be a fantasy.

There is no legit way to upgrade from the 'normal' GOTY to the GOTY deluxe version besides buying the whole game a second time.\n\nAs Todd Howard said in an interview about Oblivion: 'We made the game for hardware that doesn't exist.' Ten years after release that turns out to be a good thing. You can play Oblivion in 4k right out of the box and it looks pretty good with all settings on ultra high. If you invest a little time in modding the visuals are on par with Skyrim.\nDon't take complaints about the dated graphics to seriously as more often than not the underwhelming hardware is to blame.\n\nLike in the other games of the TES series you face a huge open world and the main quest being not stellar is not bad either.\nBut the main quest is not what most players love to do in an Elder Scrolls game. It is the masterfully created living and breathing world with hundreds of side quests that keep you playing for hours and hours with always something new to do for you. And some of the quests are really memorable and I would go so far as to say the best in the franchise.\n\nThe soundtrack by Jeremy Soule is spot on and one of the best you'll hear in any game. Shivering Isles is the best expansion I've ever played. See? I could go on and on.\n\nI should at least mention the massive content the modding community has contributed over the years. Giving you many more hours of enjoyment.\n\nAll this can be yours for a few Septims - I mean €/$. You owe it to yourself to try it out if you are into RPGs.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radioactivebiohazard/recommended/22330/","radioactivebiohazard","Slyлиса","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radioactivebiohazard/","36 products in account","I'm going to start off this review by saying that I've played this game from a disc since the year it came out (so pretty much for ten years lol)  and only recently got the steam version, so I would say I have 2000 hours + on this game. So I know what I'm talking about when I talk about this game.\n\nCharacter Customization\nThe customization is great and leaves you with infinite possibilities to making a character.\nThere are 21 skills and 8 attributes in Oblivion, allowing you to customise a class and a birthsign to give boots to certain skills and aspects of your character.\nThis brings me onto the  leveling system\nAt the start (when you choose a class) you can choose seven skills to be your "Major skills". You will get a +20 boost in each one and you will level up these skills much faster.\nAlso, upgrading these skills allows you to progress to your characters next level. You can now upgrade your attributes based on the skills you learn.\n\nStory/Quests\nThis game is story rich and you will absolutely fall in love with it if you like RPGs.\nThe main quest itself is epic and will take you a while to finish, But the game has SO much more than that (not to mention DLC).\nWith 200 + unique quests it will take you years to fully complete this game and even when you have, there's always Knights of the Nine and the Shivering Isles which add so much more to the game.\n\nGraphics/Visuals\nObviously this game is no match for Skyrim and GTA V but the graphics are amazing for 2006 standards, and are still alright for today's standards.\nThis game looks great in terms of landscape, it's full of colour and very vibrant. (In my opinion it looks better than skyrim)\nBut overall this game's graphics are pretty good and the general visuals of this game are very appealing, and you can run the game on a toaster.\n\nSoundtrack\nThis game's soundtrack is one of the best out there IMO. The main theme of this song is instantly recognisable and very fitting to the story. (The opening cutscene still gives me chills when I first hear the main theme)\n\nInterface\nYou can enter the main interface by hitting Tab. This contains your Inventory, Spell menu, Journal, Map and an overview of your skills. Each category is like a drop down menu, which is very easy to navigate.\n\nModding\nModifying this game is very easy and mods can easily be activated and deactivated in the launch menu. Some recommended mods:\n- Midas Magic\n- The Lost Spires\n- Cheidenhall Pet Shop\n- Rebuild Kvatch\n\nDLC\nBuying DLCs adds so much more to the game, though i would only recommend the Shivering Isles and maybe the Knights of the Nine.\nThe Shivering Isles is like another entire game. It has a completely different world (you can easily travel between the two using a portal), it has new monsters, spells, and of course quests, with one main quest and several side quests.\nThe Isles itself is a very interesting place with insteresting places and people, including Sheogorath, the Madgod, the insane ruler of the Isles.\nI would give TSI 9/10.\nThe Knights of the Nine is pretty much just another main quest added to the game, and I'm not going to lie it's pretty fun. I would give it a 7.5/10\n\nSUMMARY (THANKS FOR READING THIS FAR)\nThis game is simply everythig you could ask for in an RPG. It's exciting, epic and just a great experience. A must-have for RPG or Bethesda fans.\nIf you haven't played an RPG before this is a great place to start. With adjustable difficulty you can learn the game pretty easily.\nI would completely 100% recommend this to anyone. It's just an all-round good game. If you are buying it I would recommend the shivering Isles too, as it adds alot to the expeience.\n\nMY FINAL RATING\nTES IV (without DLC): 9/10\nWITH DLC: 10/10!!!\n\nJust... just buy this game","March 29","true","17.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","3"

Been playing since it was released in 2006, and I can safely say that Oblivion is easily the best Elder Scrolls game. It's a more complex and deep than Skyrim could ever be, but also better looking and it's game mechanics are easier to understand than Morrowinds, and none of the frustrating combat. Also IMO has the best music of the series, and it is also the only game in the series to let you have true free reign in creating your character. All the games before only let you select from a limited number of faces, while Skyrim only lets you choose presets. Oblivion has sliders which can change the shape of every part of the face. This lets you create some true "masterpieces" of character design: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=696164598 The storyline is also great (and doesn't have the bad ending of Skyrim) and with the Shivering isles expansion you get even more crazy. Oblivion, unlike Skyrim, also gives you the ability to create you own spells which is great fun. Only things that are worse in Oblivion are the graphics (obviously), and the combat. The combat is still good, but Skyrim's combat mechanics are much better. I would still recommend this game every day over Skyrim.","June 2","true","18.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Yes, there are many, many mods for this game.\n\nMy only complaint with this game is that it may crash every once in a while, mods or not, because Bethesda games usually crash a whole bunch for no specific reason.

The voice acting is a great addition, but not when seemingly every NPC you come across pulls from a voice actor pool of ~10 people (sic).  In Morrowind, they gave the important NPCs voices and everyone else had text blocks.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/recommended/22330/","jocosity","Communist "Joseph Ballin" Layton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jocosity/","920 products in account","Oblivion is probably feeling a bit forlorn these days, with most of the hardcore crowd sticking to Morrowind and most of everyone else abandoning it for Skyrim. And it's no great mystery why this is the case, but I still think Oblivion is a game that shouldn't be overlooked, with the proper precautions taken.\n\nIt's no secret that Oblivion is an RPG full of problems. The most grievous one in my opinion is the level scaling system, which scales basically everything in the game from dungeon loot and quest rewards to enemy equipment, gradually making the game more tedious as you level up until you finally find yourself face to face with a highway bandit who somehow found a full suit of Daedric armor and you just have to wonder where your decisions went so wrong that led you to this moment. The persuasion system is literally a joke, in which you just play a little wheel minigame where you dish out your best knock knock jokes (or boasts, if they're into that) until they have no choice but to tell you everything they know so that you'll leave them alone. I still don't know what the Speech stat even does, because as far as I'm aware you can start working on your standup routine fresh out of prison and never suffer any penalty. There's very little feeling of character specialization, and there's no reason at all to not be the leader of every guild in the game, the owner of your own order of knights, and more because even if you want to play the game as a stealthy archer or something the game all but forces you to become a combat focused character where your major choice boils down to "magic or hitting things" and there are no guilds that are strictly designed around a certain playstyle, making each of them less interesting for the people who did specialize towards one guild. The main storyline in general is fairly boring, and even the Shivering Isles expansion is fairly dull, to the point that I didn't even think that the collective content of it as a whole was as amusing as the single little Sheogorath quest in the base game.\n\nThe good thing is that thanks to the magic of mods, most of Oblivion's faults can be fixed, and when you can play through the game without being constantly reminded of its flaws there's a lot to like, instead happily focusing on preventing the game from crashing whenever it feels like it. While it certainly has its fair share of tedious quests, Oblivion has a surprising amount of actually interesting content. I found myself enjoying more sidequests than not, and there are a few that are up there with my favorite quests in any RPG, like a certain Dark Brotherhood quest. Most of the "organized" quests like the guilds (for reference, play the Dark Brotherhood if you want to have fun, play the Thieves Guild if you want to pretend to have fun, play the Mages Guild if you hate fun, and play the Fighters Guild if you really hate goblins) and main story fall flat and feel like they build up too quickly for an ultimately weak payoff, but the real good stuff is in the one-shot stories you'll find in the towns and wilderness. Another perk of Oblivion is that it's home to the outstanding mod Nehrim: At Fate's Edge, which is a massive total-conversion mod that is arguably better than any of the Elder Scrolls games.\n\nUltimately, Oblivion isn't an amazing game, but it can be pretty great or at least good after a bit of tweaking. As a special note, if you buy the deluxe edition I would personally recommend just disabling every minor DLC instead of bothering to grab all their unofficial patches, because as a whole I found them majorly disappointing in that almost all of them were just cheap excuses to get you things for free, like a house that has an ability that lets you skip one of the longest sidequests in the game or a house that has everything you could ever need for alchemy or any other of like 5 houses, quickly leaving you desperate for a quest that doesn't end with a deed to a mansion after being overloaded with a dozen quests you don't know the first thing about the moment you leave the prison. Even Knights of the Nine, the not-expansion expansion, is fairly short and not really interesting at all, unless you just think the armor reward looks cool. Ideally I'd recommend just not buying the deluxe edition at all, since the regular game of the year edition comes with the two worthwhile bits of content, but since there doesn't seem to be any way to buy the rest of the dlcs separate if you're a completionist you may as well jump for it. But overall I think Oblivion is definitely worth playing, especially since it goes on sale fairly often.","February 26","true","150.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

I owned the hard copy previously and when I saw it on Steam I knew I had to get it. The environment in this Elder Scrolls is the best out of all the games. Tamriel has a peaceful air to it filled with vibrant color and good amounts of green. The story is easy to follow and maintains interest. All of the side quests and other distractions give this game 1000's of hours of gameplay potential.\n\nThe only complaint I have about this game is the leveling system. The level of enemies is based on your level so if you focus too much on levelling non-combat skills, the enemies become very tough to kill. This is more then made up for by the rest of the game though, so I'd still give a 10/10.

In my opinion the guilds are a lot more immersive and in-depth as you work your way up the chain in a way that makes sense for that particular group; battling evil necromancers and getting recommendations for the arcane university, rather than Skyrim's cast a simple spell get into the arcane college. The main story is also pretty epic, as the invasion of the daedra draws near ever minute, you along with the local Blades need to take certain actions to stop this onslaught. Need a break from quests or need something else to do in the game? Well you can make your own adventures by clearing the local fort or dungeon, either by yourself or with a group of adept adventures behind your back. The only issues I came across dealt with the leveling up/character build mechanic. Cookie-cutter characters are hard to make as a wizard build has to be purely towards the most magicka to cast the higher tier spells; warrior builds and theif builds aren't as restricting, but are still a little rigid. Also at a certain point your character becomes "too good", as your attributes hit insane heights. You become really hard to kill, save for a room FILLED with top quality enemies or a named legendary enemy. I'll admit that the perk system of Skyrim is better, as it rewards using skills and allows for intresting characters to form. Would give this game around a 9.5/10. The DLC's are amazing btw.","December 17, 2014","true","218.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Oblivion has always been my favourite game in The Elder Scrolls series and perhaps in my top 5 ever.\n\nThe open world of Tamriel's central province Cyrodil is stunningly georgeous for a game made in 2005 and remains iconic to this day. The story is in my opinion the best the series has ever produced and this game is easily home to the best DLC from and Elder Scrolls game, The Shivering Isles.\n\nOblivion unlike its younger brother Skyrim (Also a great game) Isn't easily mastered and does present a challenge at higher levels, Yes you get god like strong and epicly awsome equipment ans spells but so do your enemies. And the best enchantments on weapons eat up your soul gems.\n\nOblivions class system is somethinng I missed in Skyrim, It makes you focus and develop your Character along the 7 skills you chose though you still can master all skills though any skill you did not chose as a major skill doesn't level you up.\n\nThe combat at levels 15+ clearly rises in difficulty. Enemies start staggering you in close quarters and you sniping skills need to improve fast along with adding some poisons and preferably an enchantment on your bow to keep getting those one shot kills.\n\nI could write a novel on the game but in short Oblivion is an excelent open world rpg with a great story fun characters and factions and always gives you something to do\n\n10/10 if you havent played this get it asap","October 1, 2014","true","234.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","8"

Sure, it might be a little old and it might not look as good as Skyrim, but honestly the game makes up for it in content.

The main questline is amazing but to be honest, I loved the DLCs and guilds more than anything. Oblivion is a very detailed world that you can really get into. I've spent hours just doing side quests and admiring Cyrodiil.\n\nI would absolutely recommend this game to anyone who likes open world games. If you can get this on sale it's even better.

It was the third Elder Scrolls that I ever played, and personally my favorite. Everything in this game was perfect. I could have played Skyrim with ease if it had everything that made Oblivion what it is. Skyrim, in my opinion, lacked something. Maybe it was the setting. Maybe it was the story. Maybe it was the higher sense of exploration and less emphasis on slashing your way through enemies. Maybe it was the breathtaking soundtrack. Here is my pros and cons list of this game and my final verdict.\n\nPros: Masterful story, great combat although bow can be a pain sometimes, side quests that will keep you hooked for hundreds upon hundreds of hours, memorable characters, I could literally get so caught up in seeing what certain npc's would be doing and seeing how there everyday lives unfolded one time i remembered seeing Penniless Olvus dead next to the poor guy were a few guards my best guess of what happened to him is that since he begs he might not have been getting enough to live and tried his hand at pickpocketing someone and got caught because i saw a good amount of gold on his corpse.\n\nCons: Bow combat can be annoying if you did not mean to pull it back because there is no way to retract it, potato faces which you can easily overlook, and not many voice actors but can also be overlooked seeing as how the quests are great.\n\nThe point is, is that this game brings endless possibilities for you to experience and how you play the game is up to you. Will you be a great hero who fights off the mythic dawn and puts a stop to corruption, or will you be a crazy bloodthirsty serial killer who teases the guard egging them on to catch you, perhaps even becoming a adverage citizen earning money off of game, errands, and or investing in shops. The choice is yours, but i can what I can tell you is that you can not pass up on playing this game it is just such a well thought out game, I myself have put in over 1k hours on this game on console, steam, and pc disc combined. If you have not got this already go and get it now, trust me you will not regret it! Final result 5/5 WILL PLAY AGAIN!","February 24, 2014","true","234.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

The quests and story are done beautifully. The voice acting is fantastic. The graphics were excellent for the time, and they are still decent to this day, but only when maxed out and with mods. There is plenty for you to do in this game, and plenty of locations to explore. With all the content, I can see why people put hundreds of hours into this game.\n\nHowever, I found myself getting bored very quickly with the combat. For a game that is intended to be played for many, many hours, you would expect the combat to remain exciting and not become stale. That's not the case with Oblivion. Swing your sword, block, swing, dodge, swing, block, fireball. That's all there is to it and it gets tedious very quickly. It's just very simple combat.\n\nThe leveling system is broken. You can spam spells on yourself and level up your skills like cake. It's very easy to exploit the system, so the urge to do it will be there. Some skills level up too fast and some don't level up fast enough. I ended up using console commands and maxing out my skills and my level just so I wouldn't have to deal with it. I feel like this game doesn't even need a leveling system at all.\n\nGlitches. This game is very glitchy. You will find glitches all the time. You cannot escape the glitches.\n\nThis game is much better with mods. Be sure to download plenty of mods.\n\nEven with all my negative talk, I still had some fun playing this game.

Whatever the case may be, The Elder Scrolls has always been praised for it's hybrid gameplay style. Blending the interesting aspect of role-playing with the fast paced nature of action games, Oblivion definitely achieves something unique. Bethesda games are almost like a precursor to the modern RPG experience. While using RPG mechanics to develop the storyline, Bethesda presents it with the classic action/FPS style that everyone adores. Thrown into the region of Cyrodiil, the player sets out to fufill whatever he/she desires. The player has the choice to completely skip the main questlines to perhaps favor the smaller quests or areas. The player also has the choice to do no quests, and to just explore the land projected before them. I think the feeling of freedom Oblivion provides is the ultimate factor that generates a replayable game. Most people will start and finish the game in the traditional way, following the main storyline and decision path until the end. But after their first playthrough, players will often go back to see what Cyrodiil holds in content. This decision is heavily rewarded with 5 different factions to join, 21 different skills to utilise, over 112 weapons to equip, over 31 pieces of armor to equip, 8 different houses to own, 9 cities to explore, and a map over 16 square miles in size!\n\nGraphicsThere isn't any reason to cherish Oblivion for it's graphics now, but in 2006, they were considered quite good. However, the blurry textures, low polygon count models, bad lighting, bad animations, and awful meshes can be fixed by a plethora of mods. As far as the settings go for graphics, they are quite good. Oblivion allows you to change pretty much everything about the game except for FOV. There will also be a few things you will want to install before playing though, such as a small mod[www.nexusmods.com] that fixes a small FPS stutter that most players experience.

You begin as a prisoner, forgetful of the reason why you became one in the first place. But by perfect execution of Deus Ex Machina[en.wikipedia.org], the player is immediately free of prison, and tasked with supreme responsibility. Now comes the part of the story that Oblivion really got right. The fact that the player has obtained this supreme task does not phase any NPC until the player makes a good impression on them. This idea is such a relieving sign of a true RPG, as many "RPG"s nowadays provide almost no sense of progression as far as character interaction goes. Not only are you graced with the oppertunity of participating in the main quest, but you also have the ability to explore the land, accepting side quests at will. I love this part of the game, because almost every tidbit of lore or story is written imaginatively by Bethesda. The player is actually rewarded by exploring the world and helping people, something that has been left out in modern open-world titles. It still suprises me how well written Oblivion is, and it's because that is what Bethesda considers their strong suit in game development. I'm quite positive Bethesda focuses more on design and storywriting instead of programming.

Due to the unique nature of these OSTs, listening to each gives me chills of nostalgia as I remember playing each game for hours on end. As far as the sound goes, however, the effects are quite good whereas the voice acting is lacking. Bethesda had less than 20 voice actors for the entire game, which is extremely underwhelming when used for such a large amount of characters. It is very destructive of the game's immersion when you encounter a completely different person with the same exact voice as someone else.

A formula that works and is fun, but it's just better and a more refined game. I certaintly think Skyrim has made even more improvements to the franchise, but it'll still never catch the charm this game delivered. The epicly crafted open world of Cyrodiil is open, cozy, natural and rural, the way I like it. Dungeons and its loot aren't as unique as Skyrim, yet they still offer great fun. Great story, but I think no one can argue about that, in specific with the dark brotherhood. Character creation isn't perfect, but it's more open than SKyrim, music's top notch and for a 2006 game; it's graphics are great and detailed.

You are able to choose between any of the races in the previous installment: Morrowind. Character creation is good, you're given the option to choose your race, gender, looks, hair, hair colour and eye colour among other things. After that you take control of your character inside the Imperial City Prision where in the cell across from you, a Dunmer will give a brief paragraph or two depending on your race. I would almost call him racist seeing as how the only race he 'likes' are fellow Dunmer. After that the Emperor, Uriel Septim VII,\nWho is voiced by Patrick Stewart is brung to your cell as there is a secret route out of the City which is in your cell. You tag along with the Emperor and his body guards through this passage as you are attacked by assasins who are part of a Daedric cult called the Mythic Dawn who have assassinated all of the heirs and Uriel is next. Eventually Uriel, and two of his body guards are slain, and you are given the Amulet of Kings and are told to stop Mehrunes Dagon from entering Cryodiil. You exit through the sewers and once that's done you are free do to as you please.\n\nYou can do a multitude of things after the tutorial, wether it's join the Arena in the Imperial City as a combatant, Join up with the Mage's or Fighter's guild, join the Dark brotherhood etc.\nThe plot begins with you taking the Amulet of Kings to the city of Chorrol and finding the head of the blades, then you must visit the destroyed City of Kvatch and find Martin who is unknowingly the illegimate child of Uriel Septim and as such, is the last surviving heir. The plot then focuses around stopping the Daedra invading Cyrodiil and crowning Martin as the Emporer. Eventually Mehrunes Dagon mangages to get into Cyrodiil and Martin must sacrifce himself to force him out and seal the bound between Oblivion and Nirn.\n\nSide quests are fun and intresting, often yeilding gold and unique items as rewards as is the same of the faction quests. The Dark Brotherhood has my favorite quest in the entire game, and probably the entire series, in which you enter a house filled with people who believe there is a chest full of gold somewhere in the house, There are multiple ways of killing them all and the best one is gradually convincing people to split up and then silently disposing of them, until you and two others remain, you can convice them to turn on eachother, and then you can kill off the survivor. Doing this will even earn you a bonus.\n\nPros\n+Large open world, free to do whatever you want\n+Quests are intresting and are unique\n+Able to enchant your weapons, armour, clothing etc.\n+Able to make your own spells\n+Lots of dungeons and Oblivion Gates to explore\n+NPC's feel alive and react to your presence as the Hero of Kvatch\n+Mods, which fix most if not all the problems\n+Game looks great, even if it is 10 years old.\n+Shivering Isles DLC is amazing.\n\nCons\n-Monsters and NPC's are leveled meaning that certian items are impossible to acquire at lower levels and that there aren't any 'easy' fights\n-NPC's have potato's for faces, but mods can fix this.\n-Unique items are leveled but they don't scale, meaning if you get an enchanted sword at level 5, it won't scale the damage and enchantments with you, meaning soon it will be useless. Again mods fix this.\n-Horse Armour DLC (In no way shape or form necessary)\n\nTL;DR Quests are intresting and fun, there's much to do, Shivering Isles is great, mods fix like 99% of the game's problems, Good RPG elements like atributes, Major and Minor skills. NPC's aren't the greatest, Horse Armour DLC exists, game still looks good today. Replay value is amazing. I could go on but I won't\n\nEasily 10/10, so much better than Skyrim","July 13, 2013","true","498.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","4","5","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Craftian/recommended/22330/","Craftian","Craftian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Craftian/","147 products in account",""This is the 27th of Last Seed; the year of Akatosh 433.\nThese are the closing days of the Third Era and the final hours.. of my life."\n\nAnd so begins one of the most popular RPGs of all time. A fantastic example of what a modding community can accomplish, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion has nearly unanimous love amongst the community, even after 10 years since its release. If you've played any of the Elder Scrolls before, from Arena all the way to Skyrim, then you'll probably already know what's in store but if you're new to the series, then you absolutely owe it to yourself to play this as soon as possible.\n\nThough still a flawed gem, this revolutionised the role-playing genre back in the day and marked the bittersweet end of the isometric days of Baldur's Gate and its ilk. A huge step up and a breath of fresh air in a saturated market, the success of Oblivion was primarily due to its ability to perfectly combine so many elements together while still producing a coherent, easily accessible and, above all, extremely enjoyable game.\n\n"You. I've seen you before. Let me see your face.\nYou are the one from my dreams.\nThen the stars were right and this is the day."\n\nThreatened by total annihilation from the other-worldly Daedra, you alone are tasked to stand against the horrors that continue to pour into the world and save Cyrodiil from those that seek to destroy it. Ultimately, the world's fate is in your hands to do with as you please.\n\nPersonally featuring my favourite campaign of the TES series, the huge range of activities, quests, factions and general shenanigans you can get up to is remarkable. While the implicit morality system tends to favour reasonably good characters, the grand campaign and truly epic final battle more than makes up for it. There's little else that has come close to achieving the experience of that final battle in the Imperial City. Plus Jeremy Soule's superb soundtrack will have you engrossed all the way through. Good times.\n\nTechnically, this game is a marvel and will run excellently on nearly all rigs.  Oblivion has certainly dated, that's for sure, and if you're more interested in more recent games, then please be warned because, yes.. even back in 2006, PC games were filled with atrocious console UIs. Thankfully, there are plenty of mods and unofficial patches available, as well as graphical overhauls and ENBs to bring it up to looking its true and (breath-taking) best. The "Bethesda bugs" and the amusing A.I. remain the same, but almost have a charm to them now and, though noticeable, don't detract from your experience.\n\nGameplay is a mixed bag. For its time, it's great and offered a great depth and freedom to the various playstyles the open-world/blank slate roleplaying encourages. Simply put, this has some fantastic dungeons. Yet by today's standards, if you're playing this for the first time, it will most likely frustrate you with supposedly clunky and repetitive combat. It certainly can also take some time to adapt and navigate the menus and inventory system. Though you've probably been hounded to play this classic, if you don't enjoy this sort of thing, then I cannot recommend it. However, if you do consider yourself to enjoy the fantasy/RPG genre, then this is the essential addition to your collection.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is better or worse, or more or less watered-down than Skyrim, Morrowind or even Online. At the end of the day, it simply is a great game in its own right.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? Stop right there, criminal scum and hit play already.","February 25","true","210.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

These are words that summed up a game that cannot be possibly described in words. Building off the success and standard set by Morrowind, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion far more than its predecessor sucked us into a rich, breathing world filled with breath-taking scenery, towns with believable NPCs with voiced dialog, factions to join, houses to purchase. horses to ride and a vast amount to see and do. Oblivion like Morrowind before it was a game you poured hours into and could still not have seen even a fraction of the game's content. The sheer fidelity, quality, and scope of Oblivion set a standard for Western RPGs to come and heavily influenced the development of Fallout 3. Patrick Stewart even lends his talents to provide the voice of Emperor Uriel Septim.\n\nOnce again, the reason why Oblivion has remained its legacy is the mod community. Oblivion has strong mod support and  countless mods have been created that add to the game and change the experience in significant ways. Among these is an Oblivion version of MOG*MOD. There is a wealth of content in this game, and with both expansions included, there is a lot to lose sleep over in this game.\n\nOut of the most recent The Elder Scrolls games, Oblivion to me seems to have aged the least well. Part of this is due to the way the leveling system can work against you, especially if you're a new player and make poor decisions leveling and allocating points. This leads to the "leveling problem" where at high levels you have an underpowered character but all other enemies have leveled appropriately. The other issue is the models themselves where most NPCs have an uncanny look to them and the odd decision not to include modeled facial hair (which was rectified in Skyrim). Thankfully there are mods to fix both these problems.\n\nOverall Oblivion is a fantastic and almost perfect game, overshadowed only by its successor Skyrim.","June 18, 2014","true","38.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I still haven't gotten around to completing EVERY quest in the game, but I got most of it.\n\nIn Oblivion, you start out in a prison cell after a small monologue and character creator. An NPC mocks your choice of race and then the emporer himself comes to your cell. The Septim line is being attacked by an unknown force, and he is escaping the city to survive. Destiny destiny destiny, tutorial, class picking, bla bla bla... and then you finally are put into the world. When you first step out, you'll either say one of two things: "Wow! This is amazing!"

The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is full of places to go and things to do. But, this is where some problems arise. With so much to do leaves a lot to be desired, and some quests end up being your typical dungeon crawler. But the idea of having an open world to explore and do whatever you want is overwhelming and terrific. Every 1 in 3 quests though did have a great amount of originality to it, from stealing a prized gem in the imperial castle itself or going to another dimension to stop a man from destroying the world. It really is amazing if you can look past the typical dungeon quests that get boring after a while.\n\nFinally, the gameplay; the meat of the review. Oblivion's leveling is complicated at best and very hard to do sometimes. It tends to be stressful, and quite honestly, dull. Skyrim had done it much better. Swordplay tends to be just slashing around a sword hoping to hit. Magic is cool, though, as if you can get into the mages college, you can customize your spells. Archery takes precision and is pretty fun to try out. The difficulty slider in the options menu is literally just "How many times do you want to hit this guy until he goes down?" There is no reason whatsoever to put it up, just keep it 1/4 up to make it better. Fighting is fun in general, TL:DR.\n\nIn the end, Oblivion is fun. It's really hard to critique this without coming across as a fan. But, I am a big fan of RPGs and you should take this review in the eyes of one. I can't see a huge FPS fan getting this and having as much fun as I did. This is really only a game for people who are not new to RPGs in general and like the idea of them. This game is a great game though, and I do fully recommend it from the eyes of an RPG fan.\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","138.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Only thinking about it makes me lyrical. The stretching fields, the daunting forests, the authentic towns, the epic storyline, the sidequests that are equally amazing. For me, literally the only negative point in this game are the faces generated by the engine. I've lost hours and hours on this game, in three different versions. If you are a fan of fantasy epics, go for it. If you like to start a game to just go berserk and kill things, go for it. If you're a statistics kinda guy, who would like every minor detail to matter, I would recommend Morrowind more, but I'd still say go for it.\nNo matter what you like, you'll probably lose days in this game. Plus, the immense library of mods existing for it make the game stretch long past its expiration date, with premium graphics mods, great separate questlines, followers, and other great stuff.\n\nBuy it. Just buy it, and never regret it.","December 8, 2013","true","54.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has perfect mechanics for getting into RPGs without being too streamlined or confusing. The environment is perfectly put together and will keep you invested for months at a time. The levelling is set up so that the game can actually get harder as you play, instead of easier and boring like another game in the series. This is the perfect game to play as a first RPG, and it will keep veterans just as entertained. This game is far over-shadowed by its comparatively mediocre sequel, and I highly recommend everyone to play this game and some of its predeccessors for an idea of what a true open-world fantasy experience should be.","December 9, 2013","true","331.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It lacks the refinement of Skyrim in combat and radiant AI as well as Morrowind depth and quest connectivity. Nevertheless, I always enjoyed Oblivion quite a lot as it was my first TES game and the one the modded most heavily. While it can be quite bland in some places, I could always look past that but it could put off quite a few people. Then there are the mods. Personally, I always found that, at least for the moment, Oblivion mods are the easiest to find and most plentiful out of the TES games. Most MW mods seem scatter across various sites while the big Skyrim mods are still in deveiopement. Overall, I would say that it is still a pretty good game that definately is worth it.","October 12, 2012","true","661.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpeanut12/recommended/22330/","jpeanut12","🎺🎺🎺🎺","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jpeanut12/","86 products in account","I have played Oblivion for about 80+ hours, completed The Shivering Isles and the main questline. I still haven't gotten around to completing EVERY quest in the game, but I got most of it.\n\nIn Oblivion, you start out in a prison cell after a small monologue and character creator. An NPC mocks your choice of race and then the emporer himself comes to your cell. The Septim line is being attacked by an unknown force, and he is escaping the city to survive. Destiny destiny destiny, tutorial, class picking, bla bla bla... and then you finally are put into the world. When you first step out, you'll either say one of two things: "Wow! This is amazing!" Or: "Wow! These graphics suck!" Oblivion is a dated classic, and doesn't look as good as games do now. But, if you can look past that, you can really find a gem.\n\nLike many RPGs, they either leave much to be desired or a years worth of adventure. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is full of places to go and things to do. But, this is where some problems arise. With so much to do leaves a lot to be desired, and some quests end up being your typical dungeon crawler. But the idea of having an open world to explore and do whatever you want is overwhelming and terrific. Every 1 in 3 quests though did have a great amount of originality to it, from stealing a prized gem in the imperial castle itself or going to another dimension to stop a man from destroying the world. It really is amazing if you can look past the typical dungeon quests that get boring after a while.\n\nFinally, the gameplay; the meat of the review. Oblivion's leveling is complicated at best and very hard to do sometimes. It tends to be stressful, and quite honestly, dull. Skyrim had done it much better. Swordplay tends to be just slashing around a sword hoping to hit. Magic is cool, though, as if you can get into the mages college, you can customize your spells. Archery takes precision and is pretty fun to try out. The difficulty slider in the options menu is literally just "How many times do you want to hit this guy until he goes down?" There is no reason whatsoever to put it up, just keep it 1/4 up to make it better. Fighting is fun in general, TL:DR.\n\nIn the end, Oblivion is fun. It's really hard to critique this without coming across as a fan. But, I am a big fan of RPGs and you should take this review in the eyes of one. I can't see a huge FPS fan getting this and having as much fun as I did. This is really only a game for people who are not new to RPGs in general and like the idea of them. This game is a great game though, and I do fully recommend it from the eyes of an RPG fan.\n\n","November 27, 2013","true","138.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The game is sort of a more relaxed Skyrim, that was my first impression.\n\nBut nonetheless, I can guarantee you that I had more fun with Oblivion! There are few games that made me laugh so hard. But don't think that Oblivion is all about laughing. The game is filled with very entertaining and well made side quests that feel as if they aren't side quests, but the main story itself. I actually did not play much the main story, just because the side quests were so good!\n\nThe graphics? Nothing special nowadays, but definately playable!  The game is just so good, that you will probably get more immersed than in Skyrim, even with the simpler graphics. Hours will fly by and you won't notice. I guess that the graphics also helped create more complex environments. The cities in Oblivion are much bigger than the ones in Skyrim. There are endless hours of fun in the cities, from messing around with the guards to exploring sewers and doing quests. It just feels more complex than Skyrim!\n\nDon't get me wrong, both are excellent games, but have slight different approaches. Skyrim is a masterpiece of beauty and thrilling adventure, while Oblivion focuses on the complexity and fun of its world.\n\nMy suggestion? Buy both!\n\n(Don't trust Steam hour record! I have endless hours of offline play in both games!)","March 1","true","61.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","2"

I really love this game, that's why I bought the game of the year edition here. To compare and re-regonize the elder scrolls back in 2005-2006.

This review is mainly going to be a comparison between the 2.\n\nMain story of Oblivion revolves around Martin Septim, the last remaining son of the emperor. He has to deal with Mehrunes Dagon, daedric prince who starts to open portals across Cyrodiil. You play as the Hero of Kvatch and help Martin by fetching him some important items and defeating a not so strong boss.\n\nQuests:\nThere are no quest arrows in Oblivion. Markers are present on the compass.\n\nQuests themselves, at least a lot of them, just like in Skyrim, require dungeon crawling. The entire Fighters Guild questline is pretty much just this.\n\nLeveling:\nLeveling is quite different in Oblivion. At the start of the game, you choose your major skills. Training them allows you to level up. The minor skills can be trained as well though. In order to successfully level up and be able to choose which attributes to give points to, you have to sleep.\n\nCombat:\nCombat in Oblivion is a lot clunkier than in Skyrim. Also some enemies can make you fall and that is not fun to fight against, even though they barely scratch your health.\n\nWeapons and armor in Oblivion also have health. The more damaged they get, the less effective they are. In order to repair them, you need to buy or find repair hammers.\n\nYou cannot fight while on a horse, but at least you have a first person camera.\n\nAlchemy:\nIn Oblivion you don't need Alchemy stations, but you will need to find at least a mortar and a pestle, an item which lets you mix potions wherever you want, as long as there are no enemies nearby. Like in Skyrim, you can sample raw ingredients and level up your alchemy skill.\n\nSpells:\nSpells in Oblivion come from the schools that are in Skyrim plus the Mysticism school. If you are a Mage's Guild member and have access to the Arcane University you will be able to create your own spells. The more powerful the spell is, the more gold will be required.\n\nEnchanting is present as well. Enchanted items can be created from the sigil stones found in the Oblivion gates and the Altar of Enchanting found at the Arcane University. You can put as much effects as you want at an altar, but it will cost gold.\n\nGraphics:\nObviously, Skyrim has the better graphics, but Oblivion can be modded as well, with overhauls and stuff.\n\nOverall, to me, Oblivion is an older Skyrim with different quests. The differences are not that big.","December 31, 2015","true","43.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I play oblivion with quite a few mods.\n\nOblivion is simply a masterpiece, hundreds of hours of gameplay all for twenty dollars with dlc. There is so much to do and like Skyrim you can simply play for hours. Imagine Skyrim but without all the hack n slash elements and with better quests and storyline. In oblivion you won't find any generic quests like go kill the beast in house or anything like that. Though there is a "rats in the basement" quest with an intereasting twist...  The game has so much replayibility, Unlike skyrim were you are the Dragonborn and the most important chracter in the world this status is not simply handed to you. To be reconized as such person you would have to become a guild leader or save a town from daedra attacks.

So far I have around 40 hours on it and I have completed the main quest, thieves guild, dark brotherhood, arena, mages guild and almost the shivering isles. The review will be in 6 sections- graphics, combat/magic, guilds, dlc, main quest, overall.\n\nGraphics:\nObviously due to its age oblivion is not looking great but it has aged quite well and the graphics does not change the fact that it is a great game. Also this can be touched up with mods.\n\nCombat/Magic:\nThe combat is not great and not particularly enjoyable. I therefore enchanted my self an OP bow early that does a ton of damage spread over a large radius(it one hits pretty much everything in a certain radius from the guy that was hit with the arrow). However I like the fact that you can cast spells whilst having other weapons equipped unlike in skyrim.\n\nGuilds:\nThis will be an oblivion to skyrim comparison\nthieves guild is better in oblivion- you steal more, get better rewards and it is less of the dungeon crawling.\ndark brotherhood I would say is equal. In oblivion it is long but entertaining whereas skyrim it is short but sweet\nmages guild is better thsn the college of winterhold. The recommendations can be tedious but the rest is a lot better.\nfighters guild is do not know about as I have not done it.\nArena is better than the s**t bards college\n\nDLC:\nThis will be a skyrim to oblivion comparison\nOblivion has a lot of useless dlc that pretty much equals hearthfire so i will only be talking about Knights of the nine, dawnguard, shivering isles and dragonborn.\nShivering Isles is amazing and the best part of oblivion. It at the very least equals dragonborn another amazing dlc.\nKnights of the nine looks great whereas I did not much like dawnguard.\n\nMain Quest:\nOblivion main story was a better plot the skyrim and felt more important. However the oblivion gates mechanic and the dragons both got boring. I enjoyed playing through both of them a lot and to be honest if you enjoyed either of them you will like the other.\n\nOverall: If you like skyrim do not be afraid to try oblivion. It might be tough to get used to but it is definitely on par with skyrim and if produced tomorrow would probably be a better game.\n","March 5","true","50.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

One, it's now almost a decade old, and hasn't aged particularly well. Frequent bugs, butt-ugly character models, and crashes (especially on newer systems) abound. Two, vanilla reviews have been done to death, and there's no reason to just talk about experiences everyone else has had. Three, I'm only doing this review to show off to my friends my excellent choice in mods.\n\nThat being said, the vanilla game was legit. I did my best to overlook the rough edges, and the game turned out to be pretty fun. Charles was the most powerful darkmage (custom class ftw) in all the land, and that was before I discovered the +100% Chameleon spell trick. Despite a much more varied and exciting Dark Brotherhood questline and the ability to create custom spells, though, unmodded Oblivion didn't hold a candle to unmodded Skyrim. In Oblivion, the daedric lord quests, Mages guild and Thieves guild rising-through-the-ranks quests, and oblivion gates (Skyrim dragon fight parallels) were boring and repetitive. Shivering Isles was fun, and had some cool weapons and characters, but paled in comparison to Skyrim's DLC quests. Don't get me wrong, Oblivion was a fun experience. However, if it wasn't moddable, I'd probably go back to Skyrim.\n\nBut it is moddable. And I'm still going strong at 120+ hours. Now for the mods I use. darkness, this is where you'll start caring. Bear in mind that 1. I may not spell it right, cause my filing system is wacky and 2. I haven't included any armor or clothing mods cause frankly I don't care.\n\nI ended up having to install a bunch of mods like obmm, obse, menuQue, and nifse. Still, most mods either require one of these, or at the very least are made easier to install with one. But, of the actual game-content-changing mods, these were the cream of the crop in no real order.\n\nDarNified UI\nMakes the UI for menus and inventories much more compact, and makes them less irritating to scroll through. Essential for hoarders.\n\nMidas Magic Spells of Aurum\nDoesn't really change the existing spells, but adds 200+ magic spells to the game, about 30 of which are actually cool. The quests to find the recipes was long, and only rarely felt like I was slogging through a pit of tar for no reason.\n\nDeadly Reflex v6/Unnecessary Violence III\nBoth overhaul the combat system, making it more realistic, challenging, and fun. Personally I prefer UV3, but I used DR for a while and it was okay. I recommend UV3, though, if only because of the many combat moves it adds.\n\nGolden Crest\nA pirate/fight club/bounty hunter mod. Adds pirates, a fight club, and a bounty hunter guild. Really irritating at times, and the custom music made my ears bleed, but the sheer amount of content was mind boggling. Just be prepared to read a lot of things, really fast.\n\nSneak Multiplier Change\nChanges the max stealth attack bonuses from x3 and x6 to x7 and x15. Though the x7 multiplier rarely works for bows, the mod still makes being stealthy far more rewarding.\n\nRanokoas City Stealth Exits\nAdds hidden ways to get into each city, so those of us with large bounties can more easily avoid the psychic guards.\n\nConduit Magic\nAllows you to enchant a weapon with any spell you cast, and then have attacks with that weapon drain your magicka instead of soul gems. Super awesome, especially if you have high magicka.\n\nThe Forgotten Realm\nThe very best dungeon mod I've ever played. Made me feel like a true adventurer, more than anything else in Oblivion had so far. A fitting adjective for the mod would be "Sprawling". Just be sure to bring plenty of torches.\n\nLaser Gun-Attack of the Droids\nThe "quest" you can do is really lame, but the weapons you can get are really awesome.\n\nAdsense Epic Dungeon\nAnother great dungeon mod. Shorter than the Forgotten Realm, and with a little too much backtracking for my liking, but still a lot fun.\n\nThe Secrets Mod\nIt adds secrets. So far, I've found only one.\n\nOblivion XP and Elys' Uncapper\nThese two together make the process of leveling up more intuitive than in the vanilla game. Plus, if you have an already-created character, the mod gives you a chance to completely redo your attribute and skill points.\n\nWerewolf V2\nNever played v1, but the mounds of shiny loot you acquire throughout the quest are worth the short playtime. Had some fairly good voice acting as well.\n\nAlternative Start V1\nInstead of going through the long boring dungeon at the start of the game, you arrive on a ship and have quite a few more options for your starting items. It also makes role-playing more immersive, though I did miss hearing the soothing tones of Mr. Stewart telling me I'm special and what not.\n\nWyverexs Runes\nAdds gems you can find that boost various stats. Not game changing, but make looting chests more worthwhile.\n\nThieves Highway\nA Mirrors Edge type mod that makes thieving and assassinating more fun, but only in Anvil and the Imperial City (for now)\n\nImmersive Weapons (the latest version)\nAdds 200+ weapons to the game, including new types, and includes them all in the possible weapons NPCs can be holding. Some look really cool (like the leafblade). Some are just funny (like the frying pan).\n\nSentient Weapon II\nLets you create a powerful weapon embedded with either the soul of a coward, a hero, a murderer, or all three. Excellent voice acting and fantastic one-liners for the characters who end up in your weaapon of choice. One of my top 5 mods, if someone forced me to make a list like that. But who would?\n\nMalevolent\nAlthough the ending was disappointing, the journey there was exciting. A nightmare for role-players, though, as it effectively labels you an enemy of the entire world.\n\nHere are some I've downloaded, but haven't had a chance to fully experience yet:\nReneers Guard Overhaul\nTorch Arrows\nSide's Backpacks\nBank of Cyrodiil\nTrade and Commerce\nBasic Physical Activities\nEnhanced Grabbing\nSneaking Detection Recalibrated\nQuest Log Manager\nHilarity\nThe Pirate Isles\nReznod Mannequins\nSupreme Magicka\nDaedric Shrine Ruins\nEnchantment Enhanced\nI'll update these as I use them, and maybe I'll probably add more as I get more mods\n\nSo there you go darkness. That's my promised list of mods.\nHappy?","July 19, 2015","true","158.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","3"

We'll start with combat. In Morrowind, your character's skill with your chosen weapon, along with one of your main stats, determined your chance to hit, as a percentage. If the game calculated that chance and determined that you would "miss" with that swing, your weapon would not damage the enemy at all, even if it appeared to go directly through them. Similar chances were put in place with blocking, where you simply had a chance to block while holding a shield, and when casting spells, where you had a percentage chance to fail at casting while still using up the magic required to try. This gave the game's combat a feeling more similar to traditional pen and paper RPGs and made combat feel more like a chore to some. Oblivion took the combat system and made it much more action-oriented and controlled by you, the player. Now, every attack hits, as long as YOU don't miss, as the player, and instead your damage is what's determined by your skills. Spells are cast, if you have the magic for it, and that magic cost decreases as your skill increases. Blocking, with a shield or not, is an active thing and more effective depending on the related skill. This made combat much more interested, when compared to Morrowind, and made tough fights actually FEEL tough!\n\nThe stealth system, although improved as far as enemy detection and such, mostly stayed the same from the previous game to this one. You still have a symbol indicating whether you've been detected, you still deal more damage while sneaking, etc.\n\nThe magic system also mostly stayed the same. Some spells went away from Morrowind to Oblivion, and we saw some new additions. Spellmaking is done differently, as is enchanting, and again, the mechanics of each of these systems is improved. A major gameplay difference this time is that you don't have to equip a spell INSTEAD of your weapon in order to use it; there is just a separate button to cast the chosen spell, even if you have a sword and shield equipped. This made combat much more strategic and made "utility" sorts of spells more fluid to cast or re-cast in combat. A few really neat improvements include new ways to get new enchantments (sigil stones) and spells (Spelltomes, from DLC).\n\nThe world, unfortunately, seems to take a step backward. In Morrowind, the world felt gigantic, even after uncovering most of your map locations, and even near the end of my years playing almost nothing but Morrowind, I was still able to get entirely lost in the world - in a good way! - and discover locations I had never seen! For Oblivion, this can really only be said for the distant corners of the game's map, and I never had a reason to go there anyway! The world simply feels smaller, even without fast-traveling. Part of this smaller feeling is that most of the dungeons of the same "type" feel and look almost the same, unless they're different for the purposes of a quest. The Aylied Ruins all feel about the same, most of the abandoned forts feel about the same, most of the caves feel about the same.. It's all just very similar! Thinking back, I can still remember unique dungeons or ruins from Morrowind, but hardly any from Oblivion, if they didn't play a major part in the main or faction quests.\n\nMy next point.. I'm really not sure if this one is a good or a bad thing. I think, really, it's neither. You aren't special, in Oblivion. In Morrowind, you're the Nerevarine (SPOILERS), and flash-forward to Skyrim, you're the Dragonborn (AHH, more SPOILERS!!). In Oblivion.. Nope! You're a prisoner who gets out and does some great things.. but you aren't special. You can't do anything that someone else in the game couldn't also do. The only difference between you and those other people is that you're in the right places at the right times and do the right things (or the wrong things, depending on your faction choices...), and if you choose to take part in the main storyline, you help Martin, who IS, in fact, special.\n\nAll in all, I feel like Oblivion improved on plenty of points that were lacking in Morrowind, though the ones that were a step backward were BIG ones, like the world and dungeons. The game plays much better, but feels less spectacular.\n\nI still recommend the game, of course, and once you're done playing, I also recommend modding the game! This is what really gets me nostalgic about the game: the mods! Modding was definitely a thing for Morrowind; there were plenty! But, to me, it feels like modding really took off with Oblivion, and there are so many incredible ones to choose from!\n\nHave fun!","March 10","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So Far  The game is really well made!\n\n\nReview--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe elder Scrolls  Oblivion is a open world,story rich  game that take place in the Medievil era. The graphics in this game is good back then in 2006 or 07.  The game has a lot of option to do, Like quest, go to caves, and more. The Story is very intresting that It's like someone is reading a book. So far after more then 15 hours of the game, I got addicted  to the game. The game is made by one of my favorite company of all time is Bethesda, same oh made Skyrim,Fallout NW, and etc. I was going to get Skyrim but my PC is so bad that i can barely run games above 2009. (unless it's a 2d shooter or platformer) The Soundtrack is by far the best soundtrack yet. The elder Scrolls is a really well progamed game. If you like dungons,dragons, then this game is for you\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPositive-Great story\n-Customizeable character\n-Very Open source\n- Peaceful soundtruck\n-big modding community\n-Open world\n-Good Graphics back then in 2007\n-Quests\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNegative-Crashes\n-Bugs\n-erorrs (sometimes)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRating9/10 "Loved it, one of my favorite games  of all time"","May 28","true","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That of course, you have to build your points in each level you achieve, such as personality, strength, intelligence and so on.\n\nThe not so challenging, but would I say repetitive quest was definitely the 'Finding Your Roots' quest, where I was constantly being told to collect 10, and then 20, and then 30, and lastly 40 Nirnroots, and dreadfully being told I can  collect more Nirnroot for future references. After spending 3 hours on the entire quest, I think I will leave it be for now.\n\nA proud moment for me was when I finally found all the ingredients to cure my Vampirism. Seek that choice at your own cost! But most of all, when you close all the Oblivion gates, that is a great achievement.\n\nThe game itself presents a lot of adventure, a huge variety of quests, a lot of places to explore and lots of dangerous species to kill which makes the entire game as a whole, a really great game play.\n\nAs part of the Elder Scrolls, I recommend playing this game first out of the series.\n","October 13, 2014","true","106.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The experience on the 360 was alright, but if you plan on buying it on PC be ready to mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of the game. Some things feel okay for consoles but not so much for the PC like the UI and graphical fidelity, then there are some other quality of life things too you might want. One thing that I found can't quite be fixed with mods is the horrid level scaling. Sure there are a few combat and level scaling overhauls and what not but they're a bit of a pain to install and get working and they tend to either not fix the problem or make it worse by making basic enemies like bandits tough as ♥♥♥♥ from the start. But enough of my rant, either way if you haven't played another Elder Scrolls game you'll probably enjoy this one, but if you have then you will probably want to mod it in some way or another. DEfinitely better than Skyrim though, 10/10 GOTYAY","June 17, 2015","true","162.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Aside from graphical quality, the landscape is bright and beautiful as well as very detailed, considering it's size. Certain towns and locations obviously got more attention than others though and the characters look . . . not . . . good. However this game is huge and features a tremendous amount of content so it gets a slight pass. - 7/10\n\nAudio:\nAgain, if you've played a Bethesda RPG before (specifically an Elder Scrolls game) you already have a pretty good idea of what to expect. The soundtrack is nothing short of amazing - it always is in Elder Scrolls' games. So, no surprises there - Jeremy Soule is a god amongst men and all that. Sound effects are also good but I wasn't too crazy about the voice acting in this one, though maybe that's just me. Extremely strong audio presentation overall. - 9/10\n\nGameplay:\nIt's your standard RPG with a whole mess of choices to make while creating your character including race, class, attributes, ect. There are many options but it ultimately boils down to the basic warrior, mage, and rogue classes - though you can use any style of weapons, armor, and magic regardless of class, which is a mechanic unique to Bethesda I believe. Combat is nothing special but, then again, it hardly ever is in RPGs. Exploration, however, is one of the strongest aspects of Oblivion and what ultimately makes the game as addicting as it is. You will feel like a real adventurer traveling across Cyrodil saving the world, as well as a few NPCs, along the way. - 8/10\n\nStory:\nSo, basically, you are the chosen one and it's your destiny to save the world. Super original right? But in all seriousness, the main quest line is pretty interesting and I found myself completely invested in the story by the time it was over. In addition to the main quest line there are also several others (Dark Brotherhood, Thieves Guild, Mages Guild, Fighters Guild, ect.) in addition to TONS of other side quests. All in all, there is a lot of story here, most of which is pretty interesting. - 10/10\n\nReplayability:\nIt's an RPG . . . and it's made by Bethesda. Just those two facts alone should tell you that you are not going to be leaving your computer screen for quite a few days, should you choose to pick this game up. I've personally played hundreds of hours of Oblivion across all platforms and still haven't completed all the quests. Also, there's real incentive to play multiple times since there are numerous races (all with special abilities) and some really fun quests that you'll probably want to replay but not a lot of key decisions to make throughout the game, at least for an RPG. So, yeah, there's replayability here. - 9/10\n\nOverall:\nOblivion wasn't declared GOTY by everyone for no reason. The explorations mechanics, interesting storyline, and immersive universe all come together perfectly to, once again, give us an addicting role-play experience. If you've never played it for some reason, you need to pick up the GOTY edition like, right now. - 8.6/10","July 12, 2015","true","53.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Obviously Skyrim is one of the greatest games of its time now but at its time Oblivion was still a huge game. The problem with Skyrim was that the world was so massive but it was kind of flat. Bethesda has always been great at building beautiful worlds but not having stories that mattered and just having endless dungeons. This game has a slightly better story but not by much. It still follows the same ideas of the different groups like the mages, warriors, assassins, and thieves along with all the other quests along the way. Still, its a wonderful game and if you enjoyed Skyrim you'll enjoy this game too. My only critique is not having companions at all and I don't care for games that just create creatures to to match your level because it makes leveling up pointless. New monsters aren't better, just given more health and more punch which kinda sucks. I'm also really glad that they made the DLC's free for buying the game and the Shivering Isles DLC is really, really good. My advice to you for this game, if you do the mages guild quests make sure you keep the character Eridor and not finish his quest. He is the closest thing to having a companion in the game and he followed throughout almost the whole game.","May 22","true","116.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

I used to watch my dad play it as a kid and died to play it. I always wondered why my dad told me to leave when he found an oblivion gate xD He finally allowed me to play it when I turned 10. I first played it at my uncle's on his 360 and since I didn't have a 360 at the time, I sucked. But automatically I could tell this game was gonna rank high in my favorite games list. My dad then gave me his disc copy of the game after Skyrim came out. I played this game for hours apon hours and was really jazzed up when skyrim was announced. I couldn't play skyrim at the time but I didn't care. Now, the reason this game is my favorite out of the 5 games (excluding ESO cause that doesn't classify as an elder scrolls game) is because of the beautiful music, gorgeous atmosphere and use of color in the landscape, combat system, voice acting, main quest, side quests, and of course all of the dungeons, caves, forts, alyied ruins, and towns you can visit. I also dedicated a lot of time into using the Construction Set and downloading community mods. It's all a tremendously fun and neverending experience. Oblivion will still be played 10 years from now with the community supporting it. I have 4 different copies of this game of which the steam edition I just bought like an hour ago. I love the game this much that I would write a really long review and buy 4 different copies of it. I couldn't tell you how long I've played this game.

No. A game literally can not be this damn good. There's a bias in my opinion of course, having played this game before I played Morrowind and Skyrim, but all things considered, Oblivion is the highlight of the series. With Morrowind you had great variation in the environment and a truly wonderful game. And then came Oblivion, offering many, many, many hours of gameplay [I have 2500+ on PS3] and an incredible replay value. A game is all about how it makes you feel. Oblivion, with it's bright and vivid colours, compelling story, and amazing design makes you feel like you're in the game. I don't want to sound completely biased, so I want to say some negative things about it, which is hard for me. There are [it being a Bethesda game, after all] a fair share of its bugs and glitches. A few quests in the game were scrapped halfway through, and hearing people reference these quests which can't be completed, initaded, or even alluded to more than once are bothersome. The design of caves, forts, and dungeons can get repetitve. Many people complain about the NPC's faces, which, in the reality of things, aren't bad. Some are absolutely revolting [Bruma guards, specifically. And this one guard in Anvil], but the majority are well done. The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard. The music is cheerful, and fits the environment perfectly. [Jeremy Soule has a talent for that, look at KotOR]. The variation in the wilderness and in the cities is delightful. Each city has its own style of architecture, influenced by various cultures from The Elder Scrolls series. Easily my favorite game of all time, no matter what genre you're interested in, give it a try. Put away any preconceived notions of the game's quality based on graphics [which aren't even that bad, especially for 2006] and experience that which is Oblivion.","March 11, 2014","true","344.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My brother told me about this game, and I wanted to play it. When I first started playing, I expected inferior graphics but that would not deter me. What I found was great story, interest mechanics, and it truly felt like an RPG. Skyrim was indeed good, but it lacked some great RPG elements that Oblivion had. I felt that Oblivion had more choices, which is a staple of TES series. The DLCs were great, so interesting, it made me love the game more. Skyrim had rushed DLCs. I finished Dragonborn in about an hour.

Many TES fans refer to is as a classic, and I can see why.\n\nQuests in this game are absolutley wonderful. The quests are very interesting, and you can get different outcomes depending on how you play, which makes the game very replayable. There is a lot of different ways to play this game, and you get to choose how you want to play.\n\nThe world is huge, and loading screens don't appear when you roam freely. The only time you will get a loading screen is if you enter a dwellin, so you can wonder all around Cyrodil without objections. The game world is enourmous, and with modifications, you can extend it even more. I doubt I will ever filly explore the map in Oblivion.\n\nThere is an enormous modding community. Even though there is not a Steam Workshop for Oblivion, installing mods is quick and somple. Modifications are still being developed, even while everyone else is playing Skyrim. Mods range from silly and funny to serious lore to really useful changes.

This game and it's sequel, Skyrim, are a momentous step forward in humanity's quest to become couch-dwelling creatures.\nThe gameplay is nothing exactly new or innovative, just standard hack-and-slash-and-cast spells, but it is made tolerable and enjoyable when added with the overall package that is Oblivion.\nThe atmosphere is where this game shines. Set in a medieval European setting with valleys, forests, mountains, swamps, and gates to Hell, this game succeeds at pulling you in completely, with an epic soundtrack to complete it all.\nThe storyline is adequate and does give you a sense of purspo as you are playing.\nAll in all a very good game","July 7, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember when Morrowind came out, how fascinated I was by all of its intricacies. I couldn't believe that a game could feel so alive, that I could be so immersed in a plethora of cultures, ideologies, races and factions all while exploring a beautiful, detailed world and the history that shaped it into what you see it now. It was the stuff epic adventures are made out of.\n\nOblivion takes that core gameplay and expands quite a great deal upon it. The first thing you might notice is the graphical upgrade. Oblivion's graphics were so cutting edge at the time that they still hold up very nicely today. The main story arch is solid, with a well paced build up and a gripping finale. Sidequests, however, are where this game (much like its predecessor) truly shines. There are a lot of side quests, guild quests, artifacts to discover, spells/gear to craft. You will always have something to do, and I find it best to micromanage by assigning priority to your tasks rather than completing quests as you receive them. Thankfully, this game has a much better fast-travel system than Morrowind's, you can click on visited locations on your map to instantly travel there (does take in-game time, so vampires beware!) so back-tracking is manageable. This is a welcome upgrade, as Cyrodiil is a VERY big place. You will also find yourself trekking through the "instanced" dungeons and planes of Oblivion quite often. Your adventures through these creature-laden locales will be aided by a very good quest compass, use it!\n\nThe expansions are quite good too, Shivering Isles adds Sheogorath's realm to the fold, which is a very interesting place- albeit a bit bi-polar. You'll know what I mean when you get there. A lot of extra treasure is also added in both expansions. An interesting thing to note: there is no linearity in this game, that is to say you do not need to do the main quest first, or keep doing it after you start it. You can just as easily do every other quest in the game, have a monstrous beast of a character and then embark on the main story. The possibilities are seemingly limitless, which is why I've played through this game multiple times with different characters- the "feel" of a Dark Elf heavy armor melee with destruction and marksman is fundamentally different than a High Elf deep magic caster with no armor but buffs/disrupts/nukes galore. Assassin-like characters are also great fun and very rewarding in this game thanks to a much better stealth system and huge damage bonuses in stealth. Pretty much every and any playstyle you can imagine is viable to play, and the ability to design your own classes is rewarding and in fact vital if you want maximum stat gains.\n\nMy parting advice: Read up on how to properly design your characters in a general sense to have maximum stat gains (+5 in 3 stats at every level up or close to it) ESPECIALLY FOR ENDURANCE. Get your endurance to 100 ASAP, the earlier you do it the higher your character's max health will be for the rest of the game. Conversely, if you leave it low then as you level up the NPCs will outpace your health growth and become much more difficult to face.\n\n5/5- Highly recommend to fans and newcomers alike.","August 5, 2014","true","427.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Why do people seem to think Skyrim is the only Elder Scrolls game? Anywase, its not, Arena was first. But down to this review. Hundreds of hours of exploration, questing, more exploration, House Hunters - Cyrodiil, (if you have the DLc...) become the Divine Crusader - Holy Knight of the Nine Divines. All of this stuff, plus much much much much more.\nI recommend buying this game as the GOTY Edition, right now while it's only $6.24, otherwise it will be $25 (But still worth it, it has all the DLC) You have 18 hours of -75%.. DO it! DOOOO IT! By the way, don't forget to mod the hell out of it. :)\nAlso, I only have 71 hours on the steam version (Purchased because I couldn't get the small DLC otherwise).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsaxyguymike/recommended/22330/","thatsaxyguymike","ThatSaxyGuyMike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatsaxyguymike/","128 products in account","The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion was my first introduction to the Elder Scrolls franchise back when it first came out on the Xbox 360. I had more time on this game across the 3 Xbox 360's than almost anything else, and there's a reason for that: this game is fantastic.\n\nI'm a guy that is most at home with RPGs, be it on PC or console and this is truly what I would consider a solid RPG. While it's true the graphics and many of the features are outdated, clunky, and annoying at times, many of these problems have been solved by the Steam and Nexus communities, and even some mods with features you didn't even know you wanted. I bought this with The Elder Scrolls Anthology and didn't play it off of Steam, hence the miniscule playtime, but I assure you, I've played this extensively.\n\nThe graphics are old, but they look better on PC than they ever did on console, and with the game's low load on your computer, even mid-tier computers can play it on high settings, and even include mods for more beautiful scenery. While there's not as much "realism" and "grit" put into this game like Skyrim did, I feel that adds to it. Skyrim's aesthetic was simply to look realistic, which seems to take away from how utterly unrealistic the premises of Elder Scrolls games really are. Dwemer Ruins shouldn't look like something out of a hyper-realistic Steampunk gallery, they should look grandiose, colorful, and awe-inspiring for the work that went into them. There's no real aesthetic in Skyrim, but there is in Oblivion. A game has much more lasting power for me if there's a style to it, rather than realism, because realism fades quickly as graphics excel. Oblivion, despite having a very dark storyline and subject matter, was bright, colorful, and vibrant. The faces were much more realistic than most games that followed it for a few years, and even though there was never perfect anything with the graphics, the colors made up for it. Skyrim is so bland and has no real diversity in its fauna and flora. Oblivion's grasses were never the same across every region. The climate changed quickly and realistically when you fast traveled, but it was gradual when you walked through the lands, and you really felt like you were exploring. The map for Cyrodil felt so much larger than Skyrim because there were just so many things to do, places to explore, and quests to do. Sure, there weren't as many mini-quest dungeons and secrets, but I'll be damned if I didn't feel more rewarded when I did finished a Thieves' Guild Quest, or more powerful when I became Arch Mage. They gave you ranks and made you feel important, and the main questline was much more satisfying than Skyrim's. Destroying that last Oblivion Gate made me feel like a God damn champion of Tamriel. I'll admit I felt more important in Skyrim's quest, but it had such an anti-climactic ending, the whole thing just seemed silly. In Oblivion, people would refer to you as the Hero Of Kvatch or any various title you held in relation to them just in casual conversation, when you walked by, or when you interacted with them. It felt like you were recognized for your deeds and not just being some person with special powers. I could keep going about various other things, but for the sake of time, I'll leave it for you to compare and decide.\n\nIn short, if you're looking for a true RPG that's both fun and satisfying, and you're willing to sacrifce graphical quality (or if your rig can handle intensive HD graphics and texture mods) then this game is totally up your alley. I'd give the game a solid 8.5/10, so it's definitely worth your time and money. Personally, I'd advise you to go buy The Elder Scrolls Anthology either online or at a local video game store, because you get Morrowind, Oblivion, and Skyrim Steam Codes & data discs, with all the DLC, along with the first 2 Elder Scrolls (Arena and Daggerfall), all for $80. It's totally worth the money in the end, because you can have literally thousands of hours of content to play for $20 more than a brand new game. Or you can pick this up on a Steam Sale, it's up to you. Anyway, have fun with this awesome game!","July 19, 2014","true","0.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is the most moddable game I've ever seen. More so than any GTA, hands down. I really bought it because back in the day when it came out, I didn't have a quater of the power in my PC as I do now. Now, oh NOW? I have maxed all settings, the largest Quarls texture packs, Kvatch Rebuilt, all the unofficial patches (over 1800 bugs Bethesda never fixed), all the official DLC (always have had that), all of the unique landscapes mods, Morrowblivion, Mart's Monster Mod, Ren's Beauty Pack, Signs retextured, Animated windows and chimneys, and that's before you consider that this game has overhaul mods that take everything to a new level. I'm talking new leveling systems, new spells, new monsters and giant monsters, new races, new weapons by the hundreds, new fauna and flora, better crafting and alchemy, more mounts, new quests and clans, new houses, new stores and merchants, enhanced UI for first and third person, attacking on horseback,  all on top of the original. Use Oblivion Mod Manager (OBMM) or Nexus Mod Manager (NMM) for best results. I have a modded version of this game on my PS3, and hand packing the mods into the game is worth it still. No Oblivion Script Extender support on PS3 though, so it really can only take mild texture enhancements like Ren's and simply scripted mods like better spells and additional merchants. Well if you've ever wanted a game that you would run more modded as The Sims here is your ♥♥♥♥.","July 15, 2014","true","42.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Set in a medieval European setting with valleys, forests, mountains, swamps, and gates to Hell, this game succeeds at pulling you in completely, with an epic soundtrack to complete it all.\nThe storyline is adequate and does give you a sense of purspo as you are playing.\nAll in all a very good game","July 7, 2014","true","21.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I felt that Oblivion had more choices, which is a staple of TES series. The DLCs were great, so interesting, it made me love the game more. Skyrim had rushed DLCs.

In a way this is my favourite game in the Elder Scrolls Series, but in other ways not, it had lots of features i wouldv'e hoped to see in Skyrim that they didnt put in, such as a combat arena, but in other ways Skyrim is better. Although I think skyrim has more of a nordic feel to it instead of a fantasy feel, like when i play Skyrim I often think it's a history lesson about nordic myths, but when I play Oblivion you get a true fantasy feel.

It's GOTY Oblivion! I can't believe it's true! Right here, available on Steam!\n\nMorrowind is considered the best of the Elder Scrolls series, but for me, Oblivion is what really takes the cake (which may or may not actually be Sheogorath in disguise.)\nThe graphics, while obviously dated, are vibrant and colorful, and still hold up relatively well. Sound design is fantastic as well, from the battle tracks, to the ambience, and everything in between.\n\nThe combat is a little lacking, and a lot of the time you won't even be sure if your attacks are hitting until the enemy goes flying off in to the sunset as a glitchy ragdoll, but it's fairly easy to overlook.\nWhich brings us to the story and quests, absolutely fantastic, most side quests can get pretty weird, like going into dreams worlds and literally entering paintings, and do a good job at bringing variety and laughs to the table. Most of which will come from the aforementioned Sheogorath, Daedric prince of madness, who I'm sure you'll be well aquanited with if you get the GOTY edition or the base game and Shivering Isles expansion.\n\nBase Game/Vanilla\n9/10\n\nWith Mods\n20/10","November 26, 2015","true","89.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And then about two years ago when i joined the pc gaming master race, i got for pc . i only have about 54  hours into the game on pc, but ive played it alot more than 54 hours. I have heard many say that the graphics are terrible , and the voice actors are too limited, but this is kind of expexted with a game as old as this. But for voice acting , at the time, i think bethesda could have deffinately done much better. The story however is amazing. I think the game over all is a 9/10 for me.

This game Is ( even though it was a previous game) 10x Better than skyrim . They screwed everyone over by taking away tons of Really lovable features out of the TES series, namely spell crafting and moddability. Sure skyrim can be modded BUT skyrim doesnt allow their mods to  be very script heavy, making the mods for skyrim very small and stupid in comparison as the mods for oblivion are the best of any game I have ever seen. Some adding in morrowind and valenwood and elswyer and some adding in quests that simply go beyond modding and add full deep enthralling quest lines that make you want more. Other than that skyrim got SCREWED over by dlcs not adding NEARLY as much since the elderscrolls Oblivion dlcs added a HUGE continent compared to skyrims weak and pathetic island( dragonborn DLC). Though many of the dlcs in oblivion were very stupid and added little it still has way more content than skyrim could ever have.","June 27, 2014","true","106.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are some issues with the leveling system and the difficulty curve, but just exploring the world and seeking out dungeons and towns and things is a really great experience. Doing quests for random villagers, bumping into events, finding loot, all of those are great experiences. The combat system is only "ok", but I never really felt like it got in the way and prevented me from doing what I wanted to do in the game.\n\nIf you're looking for a well crafted linear narrative, this is not the game for you.

But if you want to explore a huge world with tons of NPCs and interesting things to find and do, then this game is awesome.

The entirety of this gorgeous, meticulously-crafted world is open to you, with surprises and distractions at every turn. Walk in a straight line for not too far, and you'll find a door to a dungeon with a story, or a person with a request, or a concealed chest with a few goodies in it.\n\nThe stories the game tells are all great and well-written, not least of all the main quest; but I can almost guarantee the progression of the main quest will be only a mere fraction of the time you spend in this world. You will write your own stories in this game - Join the Thieves' Guild, become a cult assassin, travel the world as a mage apprentice, earn honor and glory in the Fighter's Guild, or hell, do all of that at once!

I've got over 200 hours on this game, and I'm pretty sure the time reset itself at some point. And I had it on the Xbox as well. I think that serves as an example of how much I like this game.\n\nHonestly? The vanilla game is brilliant, but it isn't perfect. But you know why you get this game on the PC? Mods. If there's a problem, grab Wyre Bash, BOSS and go on the Nexus. You're sure to find something to fix it. Or maybe you just want more content, or a companion that is pretty much an artificial person? Mods can do that.\n\nOf course, this isn't a review if I'm just gushing about it. I know most recommendations here on Steam are literally that, but I want to give you something to read. Because I love you.\n\nThe combat is lackluster. Really, it's just clicking a bunch. It takes much, much too long to bring down an oppenent, and too long for them to bring you down. There's of course mods for that - I don't use them anymore myself, but try Duke Patrick's combat mods.\n\nThe level scaling is... terrible. After you get to, say level 30, /all/ of the rats and wolves are replaced my minotaurs and bears. Bandits won't be wearing leather or fur, but high class glass. Ridiculous. One option to get around this is to choose major skills which will bring you to a specific level. For example, you might have 2 or 3 skills you actively use, and the rest you don't touch. This will keep you around level 20. The other option is, of course, mods. Frans will keep the scaling, but make it /sane/. OOO will remove it and make the world static, so one type of enemy will always be in the same dungeon. TIE is random, and adds a bunch of stealth related features. In the latter two, you will die a lot.\n\nThe game is poorly optimised. It will run fine without mods, but if you use them, espect some crashes. Don't expect to be able to load up on advanced textures and the like no matter how good your system is - it's only optimised for one core. There's plenty of INI tweaks which can help. It's recommended to Pyffi the meshes located in the game's BSAs. Don't ask me how to do this, I've forgotten and I just keep the BSAs I've made, but look it up. It sounds more intimidating than it is. There's also a few mods which help for stability, including unofficial patches, Streamline, Quiet Feet and several optimised meshes and textures. All in all, expect it to run worse than Skyrim, but it's not going to be nearly as bad as the PC port of Saints Row 2.\n\nSo, what's good about the game? Well, I can't say. I can't tell you why I love it so much. Maybe it's the freedom to do whatever you want and to explore? Maybe it's the almost humourous nature of the game, apparent whenever you see or hear an NPC? Maybe it's the world building, which isn't readily apparent to those who don't care to look, but read the books, or listening to the people, and you will know it.\n\nI much prefer this over Morrowind, which has an interesting setting, and Skyrim, which has much better combat and perks. Oblivion has a kind of spirit to it, and with mods, you can change that spirit to whatever you choose. Everyone's game will be different.\n\nThe main shame, which I havn't seen fixed by any mods, is that Cyrodiil isn't the jungle setting described by previous games, and that the main quest is, unless you look into the lore, very black and white. I suppose a lot of people like clear morality, but not me. I find myself having to remind myself that deadra don't actually have a mortal's perception of morality at all.\n\nBut, perhaps I've dwelled on the downsides of this game too much? I hope that the amount of joy I get from playing it shows that the positives, whatever they might be, outweigh the negatives. ;)","February 12, 2014","true","376.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This game immersed me for hours! I would sit there playing it and then look at the clock and it would be four hors later. That being said it is a mssive time sink. So now I willtell you what you will like and what you will be looking for if you want to play a game like this.\nPros:\n- Massive world\n- Plenty of quests\n- A very free and sometimes terrifying character creation system\n- A huge Modding community, but does not support steam workshop. Quarl's Texture pack is a must! The nexus is great too!\n- A brillant sense of adventure! I felt like exploring and continuing which is brillant!\n- A great starter RPG. It's a great RPG to start with!\n- The emperor is PATRICK STEWART! HE IS THE ONLY UNIQUE VOICE ACTOR AND HE DIES VERY QUICKLY BUT HE'S STILL PATRICK STEWART!\nNow heres the part where I give you what is not so great about the game, because honestly no game is perfect no matter how much the rosey glasses of nostalgia say they are.\nCons\n- Combat sucks. Theres no two was about it its really drab and boring and redundant it gets the job done though. Luckily there are mods that fix that! They're just a google search and a little research away!\n- The cities can feel a bit small and under populated. The biggest city in the empire only has about 30 or so people. Though the issue is prominent in most Bethesda games it's still an issue that deserve acknowledgement.\n- There are only 18 voice actors so it can be a bit imerssion breaking when you here people talking to each other with the same voice. Also the ambiant speech can be very redundant after while but tha might just be because I've played it for so much time.\n- The system for making people like you is actually rather comical. Just a few presses of a button and you have new best friend!\n\nThough there are certianly more little things wrong with this game such as how it is very buggy (Unnoffical oblivion patch fixes this issue and is easily installed on the nexus) It is still a game worth buying UNLESS ANY OF THOSE CONS ARE SO OFF PUTTING YOU DON'T WANT IT! However I have to say this is a brilliant game and is certianly worth buying! The DLC is awesome so if you get the chance and its on sale for oh say 5$ or 7.50$ it is an easy insta-buy. You will get your money's worth I promise, or it will sit in your back log because ya know steam. So all and all a good purchase!","February 1, 2014","true","53.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They are so vast that you can spend 100 hours on one character and if you start a new character you can have a completely different game/experience! The thing i love about these games are the fact it is not linear at all (as i find with a lot of RPG's), so you can basically do what you want when you want and at what pace you want.\n\nAlso, the graphics for Oblivion and in particular Skyrim are fantastic as alot of RPG's sacrifice graphics for gameplay/storyline etc. however both these titles have the best of both!\n\nThe only minor fault with this game (and this is me just being objective) is that when you get past a certain point/level with your character it can be a little bit to easy even when set to high difficulty taking some of the challange away.\n\nIf you like the RPG genre then you will love The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion & Skyrim and i would highly recomend this to anyone!\n\nI rate both these 9/10 (one of the best games i have EVER played)","January 29, 2014","true","137.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Which means easy to use and familiar gameplay, a big open world to mess around in and lots of magic and clashing swords.\n\nThe things I like about Bethesda's Elder Scrolls is that each game has his own look and feel. You want to be inside that game, you want to be able to see and do even more than you already can. Oblivion also succeeded in this, making this game a true childhood piece of awesomeness.\n\nI still like it now I look at it from a different perspecive though, simply because of the (still familiar) easy to understand basics and smoothness of the gameplay itself. It's not hard, nor is it too easy. All the way in completing the quests you'll find easier and more challenging creatures. It's just so easy to pick up from where you left!\nAnd that is one thing that is very important. The game has some bugs and glitches, and the leveling system isn't that ideal, but it still doesn't fail to entertain even now I'm grown up and reaching for the Game Industry myself.\n\nThe expansions and add-ons are sometimes a little unnecessary, though fun when you've completed the main quests.\n\nOh, and the main reason for it being less awesome as Morrowind is simply because morrowind had everything. No really; it had EVERYTHING!\n\nAgain, never get's boring, easy to lose yourself in, great setting, 8/10.","February 6, 2014","true","70.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would look at things that rebalance it (as well as the amazing total conversion mod Nehrim). Any problems that anyone has with the game can literally be fixed by modders and most likely are. I have spent dozens of hours in this game (had the boxed editions with mods on my old computer, but they got trashed along with it).\n\nAs far as storytelling goes, the story is quite compelling as compared to Skyrim. The guild quests in this game are fantastic, with the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves Guild coming to mind as having some of the coolest moments in the game. It feels epic without taking away freedom from the player character and I can guarantee that you will be reloading saves or creating new characters to try out all kinds of different approaches.\n\nGlitches do happen, as expected of a Bethesda game, but most of the time they do not take away from the experience. Otherwise a lot of them are fixed by player patches or have documented workarounds.\n\nGraphics are great for the time it was released, though they can be optimised quite a bit by installing a few patches to improve framerate. There are also a ton of high resolution mods that make the game pretty enough that you can just walk around marvelling at the world around you. People have added entire worldspaces into the game and redesigned cities, as well as made them accessible from the outside instead of going through the doors.\n\nThe playstyle of the game is pretty decent, though combat does not feel as naunced as a title like Mount & Blade. But if you're looking at this, you're probably buying it on PC so go download some of the amazing combat mods out there.\n\nOverall, if you're looking for a game that has aged remarkably well and has an amazing series of mods that ensure that you will probably never be done playing it, Oblivion is for you. Skyrim may have a much more updated engine but this old game still shines.","December 24, 2013","true","55.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The whole world is very filled up, to the point where you an just spend hours going dungeon to dungeon getting new loot. The towns all have enough variation to make them all feel different from each other and have their own feel. The combat has a pretty strategic feel to it; the game gives you different effects which each melee power attack as you progress, allowing for some pretty engaging fights. Unfortunately, the ranged combat types don't have quite as much detail as the melee, but they make up for this in sheer effectiveness. The magic is very fun to use, as you can create your own spells later in the game, which give you some advantages in both combat and passive situations. But wait, there's more!\n\nThe absolute BEST part of this game is the modding community. It's really, REALLY big. You can change how your combat works, get armor retextures, even change the game to have an XP system. You won't really run out of stuff to do; quest mods are there too (Some of them are pretty fantastic, I recommend Knights of the Nine: Revelation).

No. A game literally can not be this damn good. There's a bias in my opinion of course, having played this game before I played Morrowind and Skyrim, but all things considered, Oblivion is the highlight of the series. With Morrowind you had great variation in the environment and a truly wonderful game. And then came Oblivion, offering many, many, many hours of gameplay [I have 2500+ on PS3] and an incredible replay value. A game is all about how it makes you feel. Oblivion, with it's bright and vivid colours, compelling story, and amazing design makes you feel like you're in the game. I don't want to sound completely biased, so I want to say some negative things about it, which is hard for me. There are [it being a Bethesda game, after all] a fair share of its bugs and glitches. A few quests in the game were scrapped halfway through, and hearing people reference these quests which can't be completed, initaded, or even alluded to more than once are bothersome. The design of caves, forts, and dungeons can get repetitve. Many people complain about the NPC's faces, which, in the reality of things, aren't bad. Some are absolutely revolting [Bruma guards, specifically. And this one guard in Anvil], but the majority are well done. The soundtrack is the best I've ever heard. The music is cheerful, and fits the environment perfectly. [Jeremy Soule has a talent for that, look at KotOR]. The variation in the wilderness and in the cities is delightful. Each city has its own style of architecture, influenced by various cultures from The Elder Scrolls series. Easily my favorite game of all time, no matter what genre you're interested in, give it a try. Put away any preconceived notions of the game's quality based on graphics [which aren't even that bad, especially for 2006] and experience that which is Oblivion.","March 11, 2014","true","344.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I enjoyed the story a lot since you went in hell practically and it provided challenge where Skyrim didnt even when my difficulty was high I was able to breeze past everything like no problem. The story of course was very good but so was Skyrim's so i cant exactly say whats better, skyrim did have better graphics and voice acting and exploration. but oblivion had better guild story lines, better enemies( more of a challenge) better expansions, and better mods. so both games has its pros and cons but for a challenging, fun, eyepopping adventure I suggest Oblivion.","March 6, 2014","true","271.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The guilds in Oblivion (Dark Brotherhood, Mages Guild, Fighters Guild and so on) are in my opinion much better then the Guilds in Skyrim.\n\nAnyway, Oblivion is a great game, and i would recommend it to anyone who is a big Fantasy fan, or people who like big open worlds.

Wonderful, personally find it better than Skyrim, because to me, Skyrim you are paying for graphics, Oblivion you are paying for a game. Oblivion can be very easily modded, but seeming that it doesn't have a steam workshop, it makes the process generally longer, but, as Gaben had once said ; ' Worth the Wait. ' Oblivion will more than likely keep you occupied for easily 200-300 hours, and is very easily replayable, because of the different races, and some perks that some races get. The map of Oblivion is easy to read, when Skyrim's map was rather awkward to read, because of the stupid angle. Oblivion's storyline is rather a small portion of the game, when there is guilds, e.g Fighters Guild, Thieves guild. Some of the quests in Oblivion can be quite lengthy, and some even require you to be a certain level to complete/start a quest. The combat system of Oblivion is rather simple, where Skyrim you couldn't use a spell with a sword and shield for example, where as in Oblivion, you can use a unlocking spell, and you can just rush into a building, loot, and complete a mission for a guild.\n\nI highly reccommend Oblivion, and would definately choose it over Skyrim.","December 27, 2013","true","12.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
