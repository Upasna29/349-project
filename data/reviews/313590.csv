What the crap did I just play?\nBBP is a musical action-adventure where you play as an idiot robo-rabbit. He's the non-sequitor type so sometimes you have to leave the review in the microwave for a couple minutes so it can cool. He has a few friends but they're as useless as PEAS AND CARROTS. Seriously though I'm going to break it down. This is a short game (I consider this a plus) and you'll spend most of it fighting bosses and questioning reality.\n\nI'll give points for getting the humor right. For the most part it's good-natured, and I even got a few laughs out of it. Even when the jokes miss I'm usually in a state of shock thinking "What? Did they do that? Are they really doing this? whAT?" so I just sorta gloss over them. BBP also has a really good soundtrack, which I suppose is expected considering that this game classifies itself as a musical.\n\nAnd then there's the game-play...hmm. As I said, this game is mostly boss-fights, and they aren't too bad. I wouldn't put them at the level of Platinum (the developer), I probably wouldn't even put them at the level of U.S. Gold (remember those guys?) The boss-fights are sloppy, suffer from weak mechanics, and yet they aren't too bad. They're certainly functional, and this game deserves kudos for putting forth the effort to make every boss different. Some bosses even require different strategies, which is not something you see everyday. Also there's an incentive to finding every guitar, as bosses tend to be weak to their special effects. The rest of the game is spent killing vikings, there is a platforming section, and don't forget the part where you dodge rocks while crossing a rainbow.\n\nDid I mention this game is short? Short games are underrated these days. I probably could have beaten this game in under 2 hours if I didn't want to kill so many vikings (hate those nerds). You can play through this game, get 90% of the achievements in a single run, and even if all you remember about it is: "Things happened and then I saw some credits", it's still probably better than grinding out another experience level in some J-RPG or eliminating all of those crazy Russians that have infiltrated your base for the 1,356,742th time.\n\nAll that said, don't drop whatever you're playing just to shoot through this game. Objectively* speaking, Boo Bunny Plague is not a good game. It has heart & spunk though, and sometimes you just gotta have a little of both. If you ever find yourself undecided on what to play next. If you're wondering whether you should play Shadow of Mordor, or Bayonetta 2, or Civilization: Beyond Earth. This is the perfect time to play Boo Bunny Plague. Don't try to make sense of this decision, just roll with it.\n\n*Yes I totally just used the O word in a review. OH WELL.","October 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 68 of 74 people (92%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","92","68","74","15","0"

I thought it was alright, good for it’s price.\n- Some of the dialogue is amusing and the music is cool\n- Generally the actual combat isn’t very interesting and mainly consists of swinging an assortment of guitars at run of the mill enemies, but some of the later bosses were interesting\n\nhttp://youtu.be/HrO-LCD3rDE\nSo your abilities in combat are limited to swing your equipped guitar and a manually activated protective shield that has a limited charge. There are no special moves aside from a third consecutive guitar swing which will do extra damage and have an area of effect. The charge of your shield will regenerate but health and shields can be replenished by picking up shield or carrot powerups which will respawn.\n-----You can hit snowballs back towards ice men by swinging your guitar at them. But this wasn’t really very effective or particularly fun. So I usually just swung my guitar at most enemies without bothering to activate my shield because you can’t move or attack while shielded. When you are low on health you can just kite enemies around while you look for health pick-ups.\n-----Other than that you can run. But there’s no dashing, sprinting or rolling. But I think that kind of feature would have been nice. One of the bosses will moves exactly as fast as you run and once you are in his range it is can be very difficult to avoid his attacks. That is until you learn to stand on top of vehicles which will explode causing him to be stunned. You can toggle run mode and move even slower by walking. But I’m not sure why you would want to do this.\n-----Sometimes your robot friend will accompany you in battle and if you hit him he will fire his guns killing all enemies instantly within a short radius. He will despawn and reappear after sometime before you can activate this ability again.\n-----At one instance I noticed that he had trouble finding a path out an area and got stuck. I had to go in and coax him out. I also noticed that you and some AI controlled characters will clip through some of the walls.\n-----While you don’t really have any special attack you can equip different guitars which have different effects and deal more or sometimes less damage. New guitars are hidden around the different environments. I found my first new guitar by belting up a hippy. It was an acoustic and made love hearts appear when used. I’m not sure what was special about it aside from the comedic value. Some of other guitars I found were imbued with fire and lighting and did extra damage over time.\n-----The first few bosses were pretty straightforward and not really challenging. Most of their attacks could easily be avoided just by side stepping or running away. There is almost always plenty of respawning health pickups you can use to replenish your life whenever it gets low.\n-----It didn’t really start to get interesting or hard until I encountered the bosses War and then Famine. You couldn’t just simply beat the latter into submission, there is actually a special way to defeat her. Finding out what that was puzzled me for a fair while. After her the next boss Death was also challenging.\n\n-----The games graphics definitely aren’t fantastic. But a fair bit of effort went towards populating the world with some colourful characters and some obvious parodies of the Thor featured in films over the last fer year and the band Slayer with a song and very a very Slayer like emblem.\n-----The game is really more about the music. After all it is a musical. The fact that characters in the game frequently burst into song during cutscenes or even during the action was kind of cool. Real music is a nice touch.\n-----In regard to dialogue and lyrics, not all of it was amazing. But some of it was amusing such as that of the Vikings who occasionally call out ‘Kill the rabbit’ like Elma Fudd.\n-----The enemies that I encountered so far other than bosses were all vikings. Unless you count the robot bunny ‘competition’ and assembly line machines you encounter at the very beginning. I thought there would be more variety to the hostile entities you come across.\n-----But their was a fair bit of variety to bosses you encountered. There was a giant toy robotic T-Rex, Thor God of Thunder posing as a ‘Village (person)’ construction worker and so on. The most interesting were the four horsemen of the apocalypse. Each was a variant of the Robot Bunny protagonist or one of his friends, the succubus, the elephant man and the military robot. A moment during the introductory cut-scene of the latter felt very reminiscent of Borderlands.\n\nI enjoyed playing this game. For it’s price the game is pretty good. I think it’s worth taking a look at.","September 4, 2014","true","5.5"," 37 of 49 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","37","49","0","0"

And that's mainly a good thing.\n\n\n\n...okay, you want an actual review? Let's do this quick: Boo Bunny Plague isn't particularily engaging as a game. You alternate between running around and whacking stuff and running around and picking up health pick-ups. Why is it still worth playing? Well, it's funny and charming. Okay, charming might be the wrong word, but it's... strangely endearing and very much unlike anything else out there. It's an imperfect labor of love with crude design and plenty of apparent flaws, but some laugh-out-loud jokes, fantastic voice acting, the occasional fun boss mechanic and good music that all make the two hours or so you'll spend with it a worthwhile investment.","October 29, 2014","true","3.2"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","0"

The boss fights get repetitive, with most being defeated by simple "hit, hit, dodge, repeat" tactics. When not fighting bosses, you're forced to fight through droves of the same two types of enemies (vikings and ice monsters) while exploring barren levels. There aren't really collectibles so there's no incentive to explore. The combat is clunky and I kept on experiencing a glitch that didn't allow me to adjust the camera while running.\n\nSo why am I recommending it? The music and the main characters steal the show and are the main reason to play this game. For two dollars, it's a blast just listening to the crazy banter and music. While it started getting stale towards the end, it wasn't really a problem because of the game's short length. I found myself just looking forward to the next cut scene and not really caring about the actual gameplay.","October 26, 2015","true","3.2"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","15","15","2","0"

At its core, it is a 3D brawler, though the controls are a bit clunky, the hit detection sometimes off (hello projectile reflection mechanics!) and it doesn't look too good. I'm sure you could tell from the screenshots.\n\nFighting most enemies is just an excercise in mashing the left mouse button (or jump attacks if you like being efficient), but the boss fights are all quite well designed, really. Spotty projectile reflection aside, the bosses can all pose a challenge and I'd say are the meat of the game. Perhaps in a potential sequel, the devs could cut down on the standard enemies and just shower you in bosses.\n\nAnd god, is it charming. Every moment, every impromptu musical number (And there are many!), every line of humorous dialogue just makes me feel like the devs really loved making it, from the writing to the voice recording, etc. You can just tell this was a labour of love, not just some generic shovelware made to fit release date.\n\nAll things considered, it is a rather short experience, really only worth one playthrough. There are a few collectibles, but otherwise, yeah...\nPick this thing up in a bundle or on a sale and prepare for a few hours of entertainment, as long as you can come to terms with its other flaws.","November 23, 2014","true","2.3"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

The only real good thing is the charm of the one character you play as "Bunny" who in my opinion acts kinda like deadpool. This makes the cutscenes and dialog the best parts of the game by far. The combat system consists of nothing but lmb to hit and rmb to block, there are some strategies required for the later bosses and some of them are quite interesting but apart from that just running around and hitting them should be fine. I suppose you kind of pay for what you get seems it's a very cheap game however there is better out there for the same price range. Considering the best part of the game is the dialog and cutscenes you may aswell just watch videos of said scenes seems the rest of the game isn't that great. Graphics could definetly be alot better with the unity engine and the story line is also very.. You guessed it! Basic. The music is alright and the game sometimes turns into a musical seems bunny loves to sing about dismembering his friends, Which is good for a few laughs.\n\nIf you want a couple laughs and not much more then I recommend the game but if you want a game with good game mechanics, Graphics or story then you might want to pass on this one.","September 5, 2014","false","2.4"," 25 of 39 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","25","39","2","0"

You know what that means for the most part but for those of you that don't basically put it has next to no options graphically wise. Not that it's needed. The game's style outweighs the look. Boo Bunny aims for a comic book style with it's Cel shaded graphics (see Windwaker, Cel Damage, Sly Cooper) even so far as to include comic book style BAMFs and POWs.\n\nThe Audio has to be the strangest and best part of the game though. Aside from the general audio strangeness (It's quiet at some points and louder in others) the soundtrack is one of the most amusing and head scratching bouts of confusion in the game. I found myself just staring at what was going on and laughing. The VO work could leave something to be desired but again it awkwardly fits the whole game.\n\nGameplay wise, it's a little less. Bunny moves very awkwardly at least by modern standards. I found the KB + M controls more comfortable than the X360 controls but I guess that comes to preference. It's very much inspired by old school hack n slash games though, so the awkward movement and janky animations are almost endearing at the same time but that's probably the old nostalgia goggles making me think that.\n\nThere are a few bugs that I've encountered, Bosses shooting through walls, enemies bounce around sometimes and (although not a bug) the hitboxes seem really weird. Heck, I'm writing this review right now because the game crashes after I Alt+Tabbed out.\n\nDifficulty is also a little strange. At the start, the regular enemies will kick your buns while the bosses go down without so much as a whimper. The first five bosses fell for the most part without even landing one hit on me.\n\nThe game lacks some explination too but it's almost part of the fun to try to figure out the bosses weaknesses.\n\nI feel like with a little bit more polish, BBP could be a beyond great game but for me right now it's just sitting at really good. It's a fun game, give it a shot.\n\nSIDENOTE: The crash I just mentioned wiped all my data. It looks like BBP only saves your game when you actually select quit from the menu.

It's so rare for me to be perfectly ok with mediocre gameplay just to keep hearing more dialogue.\n\nBoo Bunny or just Bunny or...I'm honestly not sure, I don't recall a NAME being said...is born when a disgruntled employee in a robot bunny factory uploads a virus thing and you spring to life as a crazy person with a guitar, which you use to beat on things. There isn't really much in the way of a combo system, and you are fairly fragile, but you can block with a recharging shield that doesn't really work great either.

Because about 80% of the game's fun comes from the music. The humor is very adult-swim-ish, so if that's your bag? You'll like it.\nBut you should know that the gameplay? Is just alternating between hitting things, and shielding yourself. And the enemies don't really put up that much of a challenge.\nBosses are also pretty straightforward, save for a couple that I'd like to share some hints on.\n\n- During Famine's fight, pay close attention to what bunny is saying. She isn't like the others where you can just smack her around and be done. Use the handicap to your advantage. It took me a little while to figure it out, but the fight is really easy once you get it.\n- The hippie guitar you get in the beginning works REALLY WELL on one of the 4 horsemen.\n\nIt's also a relatively short game, and one you're not likely to play a 2nd time. But it's funny, it's very playable, and I can imagine them doing a much more polished sequel if they get enough support.

The boring levels are for the most part forgivable, as the player knows they are working towards the next interesting boss fight or funny musical interlude. My main criticism is that the combat lacked depth and level enemies didn't vary enough. For the price Boo Bunny Plague is definitely worth a play through and has earned 6 out of 10 from me.\n\nSTORY\nI actually really enjoyed the crazy storyline of Boo Bunny, and loved the ridiculous face-offs against some pretty famous gods of Viking mythology. I have to reinforce though, this game is a musical as well as an action adventure, and for the most part the songs littered throughout the game are very creative and funny, but occasionally out stay their welcome.\n\nGAMEPLAY & COMBAT\nGameplay and combat in Boo Bunny, is simple, with the player being able to slip straight into this game and get the hang of it quickly. This straight forward control systems seems like a blessing initially, but soon becomes the weak point of the game. With a one button combo system, a difficult to use block mechanic, clunky movement controls and a touchy camera, things get stale quickly but this is alleviated slightly through some fun boss fights.\n\nFighting against gods like Thor and Tyr are exciting, and the challenge in this combat is in trying to analyse the patterns and work out their weakness. I am torn about the control system in Boo Bunny Plague, on the one hand it is boring when implemented in each level, but when considered in the realm of boss fights it is still clunky but far more entertaining. I won't go into any more detail about the boss fights as they are the core of the game, but I will say there is one boss in particular that has a very clever design.\n\nVISUALS\nGraphically, Boo Bunny looks like an early cell shaded game from the PS2/Xbox era, though I am not sure whether this was done to make the game more feasible to create or as an art style choice. At any rate I think this dated-vintage look works for the game and apart from the odd clipping and collision detection issues I enjoyed the visuals on the whole.\n\nMUSIC\nBoo Bunny's music is a central point of the game, and I found myself having a good chuckle through many of the songs. There is the option to purchase the deluxe edition, including the soundtrack and a couple of other goodies, but the songs in my opinion are a listen once affair, and are more entertaining when heard in context.\n\nFor my full review and heaps of other delicious content see Glitch[glitchnews.com.au]","October 15, 2014","true","3.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/scientistB/recommended/313590/","scientistB","Sciwako","http://steamcommunity.com/id/scientistB/","67 products in account","Let me tell you about this pretty game called Boo Bunny Plague.\n\nI picked it up using some of the rare Steam funds that I only seem to get once in a blue moon while it was on sale, and honestly I do not regret a penny. This game proudly holds the title of "the first game that made me buy it instantly after watching the trailer."\nSo what is this game about?\n\nIt's a game about a metal toy bunny who just wants to make the money required for an auto-repair, and along the way he goes across an intergalactic journey with his three pals trying to earn that money. I can only describe it as a linear action/adventure game, similar to games in the PS2 era. I loved my PS2, so to see a game that was so new yet classic-feeling at the same time was really something.\n\nBut where this game truly shined was in its creativity. There's no exaggeration when I say that this game is really freaking funny. There are hilarious moments with every cutscene, and even during the gameplay itself, which are either original jokes or references. In the first half of the game, the subtitles definitely made me crack up a few times.\n\nOn that note, the voice acting is brilliant. Each voice actor truly gave their characters life and personality, and a lovely singing voice I might add. Yes, there are numerous songs in this game, and for some reason, I love it. I've never seen another game do anything like it, and it worked beautifully. I am actually listening to the soundtrack while I am writing this, which I got with the game.\nOh yeah. It's not just the singing I like, but the music too. It's so memorable I catch myself singing random songs throughout the day.\n\nHow is the actual gameplay like? For me, it's smooth. I used the highest graphics settings and the game looked beautiful. This may be different for other computers though. The graphics themselves may not look as "detailed" as modern games, but personally I enjoyed the cartoony feeling this game gave me.\n\nThe controls are simple to understand, and I used a gamepad for it. The levels themselves aren't too difficult, and there's an amount of different guitars to collect, some of which are optional and hard to find. Bosses occur very often in this game, and while some of them are easy to defeat, others are tricky and cause you to think before you just rush in and attack. There usually isn't a large penalty for dying, you'll just respawn instantly at the beginning of the room, or somewhere a few seconds from the point you died at.\n\nWhen completing the game and finishing the credits sequence, you unlock Impossible Mode, which, as you would guess, unlocks a much harder version of the original game. There's not much else going for it besides an achievement for beating it, but that was enough for me. By the way, I should mention that the game itself is rather short; it would take an average playthrough about two to three hours or so to beat it. But that doesn't make the game bad; I've played countless games that are short, but have loads of charm and memorability to me, and this is among my favorite. I've actually played through the game three times at the time I write this, once on Impossible Mode. It's a heavily enjoyable experience and I've actually found a few funny bits that I missed on my first playthrough.\n\nThe combat system is very simple. For the most part you have to mash a single button to beat enemies down, and hold down another to activate a temporary shield. Some of your guitar-weapons, however, have special effects to aid in combat.\n\nAnother enjoyable aspect about this game is that it makes no darn sense. As the plot unfolds you're asking yourself just what the heck you're playing, and it kept me entertained the whole way through, what with Bunny's singing episodes and Gunny's overuse of the word "Yes," which I have begun to take up when I type to people.\n\nMany of the levels are linear without a whole lot of exploring, but I can guarantee you'll get a laugh out of the game at least.\n\nAlso, the developers are very involved with this game, and they will be very responsive to almost any question or concern you may have. A few updates have come out already fixing certain bugs, and I feel the developers are doing a great job. A sequel is possible, and I would love to see that; that's why I hope more people will learn about the game after reading this review.\n\nEven at full price, this game is entirely worth it. Whether it's for the humor, music or gameplay. It's a strange yet fun adventure filled with wonderful characters and a great sense of humor. It may be short, but think of it like a Jolly Rancher; so small, but bursting with delicious flavor. Boo Bunny Plague is a fabulous gem worthy of more attention.\n\nI recommend this game, yes.","October 28, 2014","true","17.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

So why aren't I giving this a thumbs up?\n\nwell the combat system is melee but not terribly good melee. I could look past this but for one other aspect of the game. The final stage of the final boss is just lousy. There are no real tactics to beating it just sheer lucky. By this point you have lost your shield, and you are facing off against 3 pretty hefty attacks, the moment you see an opening and take it to attack the boss teleports away about 90% of the time.\n\nIf it only took a couple of hits to take out the final stage of the boss maybe it could be excused but seriously you have a boss battle you end up giving up on not because it is so difficult but because it has been crafted in a way that means it takes so long to complete you just become bored with it. Add to that that one attack will instantly kill you, one will do medium damage and stun you and one will do medium damage.\n\nDon't get me wrong some of the other boss battles are hampered by the poor combat but at least there is a technique or method to them the final oen is just sheer endurance and not getting so bored you turn off the game.","May 30","false","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But, the worst part: The Glitches. Seriously, I actually doubt if they playtested this. To name a few: Famine will do nothing if you die once and fight her again, dieing in Hell results in the camera being stuck at a close Bird's eye view, preventing you from seeing jack ♥♥♥♥, and I constantly got stuck in the wall during the Garmr fight.

I went into this assuming it was just going to be some generic action platformer.  Boo Bunny Plague has a very rough start that doesn't show much of anything besides sub-par combat, but about 15 minutes into the 3 hours it takes to beat, the game starts showing you what it's really about. Like music.\n\nBecause this game is a musical.\n\nBetween level transitions, before boss fights, sometimes in the middle of a boss fight, characters will start breaking out into song. Really ridiculous, absurd songs. The main character, Bunny, feels like a mix of Deadpool, SCUD, and Brak from Space Ghost, so that's the level of complete nonsense humor you can expect. I can honestly see people not liking that, but Bunny crossed some sort of line where he was so obnoxious I came back around to liking him again. The story is oddly themed on mythology, with the main conflict being between the Norse pantheon and figures in Christian mythology. It's weird as all hell, but it made me want to see what they'd pull out next.\n\nUnfortunately, the base gameplay never really moves on beyond one button to swing your guitar and one to pull up a shield.  As the game goes on, though, you'll spend less time fighting random enemies. Bosses actually end up being fun in spite of the primitive combat, with some puzzle fights (one of which I thought was rather clever) and trying to find creative uses of different hidden guitars you find along the way.\n\nBoo Bunny Plague is weird, fun, short, and $2.

It's one of those games you'll have people go "Wut?" to whenever you explain it to them, but it makes them more interested in playing anyway.\n\n"Boo Bunny Plague" puts you in control of a rather semi-insane animatronic bunny that has an adventure with his friends, namely a military gun robot, a semi-demon girl and an elephant man, battling gods and whatnot in order to get himself an Auto-repair unit. The premise makes no sense whatsoever, and will have you wonder what exactly it is you're playing most of the time, but it's not to an extent where you don't understand it anymore. Even though the game feels extremely illogical, it's never inconsistent, and especially the boss battles have a pattern that can be found and followed nicely. There were a few moments where I got stuck on where to go, but they were few and far between.\n\nThe gameplay is very basic. You control the main character the same as any other 3D platformer/brawler, and only has two moves, namely an attack and a shield. At first, you won't be using that shield much, but in the end it'll be your best friend. You attack using a guitar, and you'll find several of them along the way, each with their own powers. Attacks are always basic, there is no true "strong" or "heavy" attack, but you will be getting a combo kind of idea when you attack an enemy multiple times.\n\nThe graphics are incredibly average. I can't really say they're good, but they're not bad either. It kind of feels like an early Telltale game, with cartoony edges and lines displayed on the characters and the environments. It fits rather well with the whole setup of the game, and I enjoyed its style quite a lot.\n\nThe music, other than the singing, was really good. However, if you're not a fan of (soft) metal or fast-paced rock, there might be a chance it'll put you off. Once again, the music compliments the overall game really nicely, and especially the boss battle music really did a good job at improving the gameplay.\n\nThe game also features voices, and yet again these fit great with the characters. The main character Bunny has a voice that'll make you think you won't like it at first, being a bit naggy and over the top, but grow to love as you progress through the game. I personally love the voice of his sidekick Gunny, because it sounds exactly like it should with his character. The other voices are what you expect, nothing special but fitting, and there is one voice in particular that'll remind you of someone later on in the game.\n\nIn conclusion, "Boo Bunny Plague" is as random a game as the name it's known by. Though you won't be getting more than a few hours out of it (3-4), your time won't be spent in vain as you'll be welcomed with a crazy story, insane characters and horrible yet lovable singing (and as another reviewer said, this is supposed to somewhat represent a musical). And with a price tag of 2 dollars, there's very little reason not to get it, though I suppose you could always wait for a sale.\n\nRating: 7/10. Let's hope they'll release that sequel :)","March 21, 2015","true","2.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Now I have the actual paperback DC comic and when I read it, I was interested.  I kind of enjoyed Bunny and Gunny and the idea behind the story was pretty cool, especially to see in video game form.  Then I actually played it and well...\n\nFor a beat-em-up, this game feels awful, clunky, and unpolished.  It feels as if you're sliding on ice, and when you hit someone, it feels like your weapon is a foam noodle in the shape of a guitar while everyone else has something that can stun lock you for eons.  Then there's the shield meter, which honestly is a pointless gimmick because it doesn't really stop people from attacking until your shield energy is gone, leaving you with two choices.  Hit and run, or hit and get hit by everything else.\n\nHow the story is executed is kind of irritating as well.  The jokes aren't placed well at times, voice acting goes from Dynasty Warriors bad to pretty okay.  Bunny, even though I like the character, got on my nerves quite often, and there felt like there were a fair bit of things that weren't explained in the game.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I would love to see a sequel, or even a remake of this game.  But only if they fix the awful combat they had in it.\n\nOh right, the music was pretty good.","November 19, 2014","false","0.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

On the one hand, the story (and the music) are surprisingly funny, as long as you're okay with over-the-top violence and explosions and a homicidal mechanical rabbit.  The story is rarely the highlight of a game, but here it is.\nOn the other hand, the game itself is horrible.  Just plain awful - horrible controls, little if any variation in attacks, boss battles that are tedious (seriously, the penultimate fight is against an HR representative who takes phone calls during the fight so you have time to gather health) and unforgiving, and enemies you can literally walk through, with hit boxes that may or may not connect. I almost gave up after the first level, but I figured it had to get better.  It doesn't.  If there was ever a game to watch someone else play on Youtube, this is it.  That way you get to enjoy the seriously warped story, but don't have to suffer through the fighting.","February 1, 2015","false","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

The best way to describe this game is that it feels like Metalocapyse, Aqua Teen Hunger Force and the Brak show put together. It combines great music, funny dialouge and an interesting world. At no point does it feel like your playing a game but rather experiencing a story worthy of a primetime slot on Adult Swim.\n\nIn keeping with that comparison this game does not at any point feel like it has a high production cost, not saying that it didn't cost the develouper a lot to make it. The game mechanics are also not very innovative and the art is stylized but not detailed to the degree some people may be used to. However for a game like this I think none of that matters. It has all the mechanics needed to keep a player engauged and help tell the story, not to mention the game genuenly feels challenging on normal.\n\nPlay this game if you want to experience a fun story with memorable characters and I guarantee you will want a sequel by the end.

And here is way.\n\nYou play a bunny-robot named Bunny, that accedently receive consciousness, but he is not very bright. Another robot saves you from the factory you are in and from here starts your adventure for auto repair for Bunny. But nothing is what it's seems and soon everything goes wrong. The insane (in a good way) story and the boss battle are the things that kept me going. I wanted to see the next boss, the next crazy cutscene. In almost every cutscene there is a songs perform by the characters and the dialogue between them are well written. All this makes me smile and in some points even laugh and this mean the game is doing somtething right.\n\nThe graphics are decent for indie game. The textures are not good looking, but the world and characters are all cell shaded, like in comic book and you may not notice it. Sometimes, when you hit enemy letter coming out from him, just like in a comic book. Now that I think about it, from this game may come really good comic book.\n\nThe level desing is simple. The places you visit are different enough, but layout is not very creative. I can't point a single level, that is stuck in my mind. They are not good, not awful, just okay.\n\nLike i wrote in the beginning, the gameplay it's not that good. You have regular 3-4 combo attack, jump and hit, and the right mouse button is your sheeld. That it's, not very deep. The weapons for Bunny are little unusual – guitars. They are eight and you can find them in the world or some NPC will give it to you. Some are on fire, ice, lightning and they do additional damage.\nEnemies you face are all the same. Barbarians shooting with crossbow, other attack you with sword or axe. There is also giant blue monster. But they are all filler. The real battles are with the bosses. Here is where the game shines. They are different from each other and may give you hard time. It' boss battle, after boss battle, after boss battle, after boss battle. It's madness. One advice – choose highest the difficulty.\n\nVoice acting is good, every actor fits really well with their character. On the other hand the sound design is questionable. Some sound effects are just week. But the soundtrack is amazing. Even when i'm wrighting this review i'm listining it. In addition to the song performed by the characters there are really good punk, hard rock and metal tracks. I couldn't find name of the performers, so I assume they are some undergound bands, although one song sounds like AC/DC. But in some places i notice i can't hear the music, despite it's increased to maximum.\n\nThe controls are fine with mouse and keyboard. You can play with controller, but i did't try it. The game is not long, between 2:30-3 h, but it's not very expensive. I think the length and the value are perfect.\n\nWhile I played Boo Bunny Plague I felt like I was in a cartoon or comic book. The game is charming, sweet and I had fun. Nice humor, crazy story and characters, amazing music, great boss battles. All this make me recommend it, but keep in mind the simple level design and combat.","January 6, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Not doing a formal pro/con thing.\n\nI bought the game and soundtrack on yet another ridiculous Steam markdown.  I think it was $1.49 for the combo.\n\nOk, so, the best way I can sum up my review is this:  if you have no speakers or headphones, or if this game lacked all audio, it might *barely* be worth a dollar.  The graphics are fun, but pretty basic; if you're expecting AAA level characters, backgrounds, and animations, then you really gotta re-evaluate your expectations.  The enemy variety is nearly nil, as you're mainly dealing with a handful of Vikings, and a bunch of bosses.  The fighting system is meh.  Blocking seemed to be unnecessary for most of the game (except for boss fights, which is actually most of the fights).  You have a guitar-sword (a selection of them, really), and you can jump.  But jump-strikes don't seem to do anything special.  No distance weapons, either.  You also get your "friend," Gunny, who will jump in and shoot on occasion.  Gunny's kinda cool.  Like a weaponized version of Pintsize from the online comic Questionable Content (though it's possible I'm the only one who sees a similarity).\n\nNow, re-enter the reality in which you have working speakers and/or headphones.  The audio completely makes this game.  The soundtrack is an absolutely great match for the style.  The writing and voice acting is great.  It's good, on its own merits, but it's damn near perfect for the feel of the game itself.  And the writing is great.  Very creative, very clever.  Irreverent may be a bit too understated.  The characters are generally well-crafted, though I will say that Faye could have used more development.  She's an interesting character, but could have used more backstory.\n\nAs an aside, as weird as it is, the game made more intuitive sense to me because back in the days (ok, two decades ago) I became obsessed with a PC title called Hammer of the Gods, by Holistic Design/ New World Computing.  That game seriously deserves a re-boot for this generation of PCs.  But I digress.\n\nHere's the bottom line.  I paid $1.49 for the soundtrack and game.  I don't know if the game would be worth the original $5.00 asking price in terms of gameplay, but I think it's worth the asking price to reward the creators and publishers for releasing something this creative and original, and as encouragement to make a sequel.  (On second look, the original price might have been $2.00?  Really?)\n","March 21, 2015","true","17.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

And on top of that you never displayed how that mechanic actually works "Hit Gunny" that's all. Never mind the fact that so much time, he feels the need to arbitrarily explode. I also found that my dominant stratagy was to run and attempt to accomplish whatever objective  I had while leading a conga line of enemies who's only ai is say things, see enemy, say thing at enemy, run toward enemy, and (if within range) try to hit enemy.\nThe music I had to shut off because I found it so ADHD and grating. If you're going to write music make it understandable to someone not on whatever foreign planet of game design you currently inhabit. And especially don't have a grating song play on loop while you have to irradicate a town of about 50 of the same three enemy types. In short don't buy this regardless that it's two dollars. You'll find it grating and tedious to do anything. and I agree with one of my peers "SPASTIC TALKING TALKING TALKING CANT STOP GOTTA SAY SOMETHING CANT STOP EVER GOTTA BE RANDOM GOTTA TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK TALK"","June 10, 2015","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

Controls are terrible, there are many glitches and annoyances. Movement alone is fairly awkward. It's not funny (as people keep repeating) unless you think something along the lines of Looney Tunes cliches over and over are ever-so-hilarious, which, unless you're 4 or 5, you probably have seen and heard one trillion times and weren't exactly humorous to begin with. The graphics are like something out of 2003, the main character's voice is obnoxious and pierces my inner-being; particularly when he decides to sing out of no where (again the whole Looney Tunes cliche thing.) Gameplay itself is not very entertaining, flail around the poor controls and tap a single attack button, doing the same rough animation movement for an attack over and over to a practically non-existent story other than 'oh look a robot bunny became sentient and is now basically a cartoon character in personality and style.' There is usually one enemy type per level that all act and follow the exact same motions and "AI" pattern, etc. I paid like nothing for this game, (like 75 cents or something?) so I suppose I get what I pay for, I wasn't exactly expecting much.

Intentionally super hammy musical sequences, bizarre things that just "are" for the sake of being bizarre, simple and nonsensical plot devices and the like.

The music in this game is very interesting in fact that the story is basically a musical is enough to win me over.   At first combat appears to just be hit and run but as you progress in the game you will actually need to come up with a game plan and learn some of the boss mechanics.  The only thing that I would say negative is sometimes the camera angles get in the way in some of the boss battles.","November 11, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The sound track is amazing, but the gameplay is bland. There are jokes, but most of them are the cliche idiot ones. The game is cheap and a good way to kill time.

I saw the trailer, looked at the screenshots, and I was like "Huh, this game looks like it's okay at best, god awful at worst," until I saw that it had positive reviews, and even a comic book made by DC. At that point I looked at the 2 dollars in my wallet and knew that they had more purpose than browsing the marketplace. And I will give the game this, I wasn't expecting anything that happened in it, but in the "why does this game exist" kinda way. First thing right of the bat is that the main menu sets a bleek tone for the quality of game thats to come, but it is a 2 dollar game on steam, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. To anyone thinking of buying this game, first thing you'll wanna do is turn the game's volume down way low, as the game is way louder than the sound effects in the menu. The game was made using unity, and it looks the part. The cutscenes in this game are optimized in the way a free unity game is, which anyone whose played one will understand. After the first cutscene, I try to get a hang of the controls, and they are alright, but in combat aiming is hard, and hits lack impact. Also you take damage in a constant stream, which makes things very difficult later on. So I get to the next cutscene and I realized something horrifying.....THERE ARE MUSICAL NUMBERS ALL THE TIME. A L L  T H E  T I M E! Bunny's voice is intentionally annoying, which makes the songs annoying. Theres a mission near the beginning where you are tasked with killing 25 vikings around a city, and a "HUNTING BAD GUYS SONG" plays the entire time. It makes me want to commit suppaku with a doorstop. Not really....hell that was just a terrible metaphor...anyway, I'm going to recommend this game, as it is a sight to behold, and I don't want to spoil the fun. Trust me, it gets weird.","January 13","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the first few minutes I was grinning like an idiot, and that kept up for half of my playtime.  More movie than game, the real star of this is the characters and dialogue and cutscenes, and the gameplay itself serves as a sort of bridge between scenarios.  The combat isn't broken, just kind of bland, but it's excusable.\n\nWhile definitely not a style of humor everyone can enjoy, if you're interested I can wholeheartedly recommend it for 2 dollars.  I found myself making numerous connections to the humor of Homestar Runner and, to an extent, Fooly Cooly.  Intentionally super hammy musical sequences, bizarre things that just "are" for the sake of being bizarre, simple and nonsensical plot devices and the like.  It treads the line of being "so randumb xD"  but the way it's handled, I'd say they pull it off.\n\nShort and sweet, cheap and silly, fun overall!","January 18","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
