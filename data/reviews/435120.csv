It is not even past.\nRusty Lake Hotel is the 7th game in Cube Escape series, a series of mostly freeware room escape games with elegant yet disturbing undertone. All games in the series can be either reached via Kongregate, or can be purchased as a freeware for iOS or Android. I've played the first of these games, Cube Escape: The Lake in Kongregate some years ago, and found out that the developers continued to make new games in the series, revealing new clues to the spiritual, surreal yet eerie world of the Rusty Lake, connecting pieces of a morbid story with each new game. If you are curious and would like to appreciate the world of Rusty Lake appropriately, I strongly suggest you to play other games with the intended timeline to fully enjoy the experience that is Rusty Lake. Most of these games present you 15-20 minutes of gameplay with more anecdotes to speculate about the nature of the given world and its setting.\n\nIn this short yet morbid puzzle game, we take the role of a butler that serves in the Rusty Lake Hotel, a mysterious establishment settled upon a small island in the middle of the infamous Rusty Lake. The world of Rusty Lake is inhabited by odd andromorphic animals, including our hotel staff: all knowing and charismatic hotel manager Mr. Owl, silent attendant and receptionist Mr. Crow, bell boy Mr. Bat and chef extraordinaire Mr. Toad. In a fateful evening, our guests arrive: Mr. Deer, Mr. Boar, Miss Pheasant, Mr. Rabbit and Mrs. Pigeon. They will be staying with us for a short while, and it is our duty to attend their needs and arrange an excellent dinner party for our guests each night. Sounds simple enough, yet with each passing night our encounters grow a bit more disturbing, ending with a peculiar story revelation somewhat meaningful only if you've played previous games.\n\nHere comes mild or speculative spoilers, so feel free to skip this paragraph if need be. As a personal interpretation, the Cube Escape series, aside from highly disturbing point and click adventures, serve as symbolic happenstances concerning memory, deed and afterlife. Various figures with their own vices - like vanity, gluttony, greed etc. are presented as andromorphic animals in this surreal habitat where they'll be lured with their own vices as bait and used to satisfy a supernatural demand by gruesome means. The hotel and its environment serves as a Limbo-like setting for their memories to be extracted and collected. It was mentioned in previous games that the lake feeds on memories and whence memories are extracted from guests, what is left would be unsettling creatures of nightmares - or rather our antagonists for the following games. Yet again, this is just a personal interpretation, so I highly suggest for you to try other games to present your own. It all is quite Silent Hill-ish with a touch of John Keddie.\n\nThe game mostly consists of a basic point & click adventure, with some neatly arranged puzzles and a room escape concept for each night. If you manage to complete the game, you will be given a code to use in following Cube Escape games, revealing more information about the nature of this symbolic setting. This is a gruesome and short experience for your own contemplation considering all events and figures presented are highly symbolic and more so supernatural. It's more like surrealist art; completely open to interpretation and even to introspection.

I’ve played less than an hour and a half so far, so there will likely be more to be said, and this may be uncommonly brief.\n\nThe premise of “Rusty Lake Hotel” is you are Mr. Owl, and you have invited 5 creature friends to your hotel for a visit, including a special meal each day. Not to give too much away, but each day there is one less guest to entertain. This is a humorous game, but which also contains some pretty graphic cartoony violence and gore.\n\nDuring the day you explore the hotel, talk to the guests and employees, and look for objects needed later. This phase is generally quite brief, as it’s basically just a preamble to the nighttime puzzle work. Only at night are you able to visit the guests in their rooms, and that’s where the fun begins. Each guest’s room has a theme. Mr. Rabbit is a magician, and his room, and the puzzles to be solved, involve magic. Mr. Deer involves finding the ingredients to fix a drink, including puzzles involving volume (as well as others, all closely inter-related.) Ms. Pidgeon, who has asked you to run her bath, has puzzles involving electricity and math. Most of the puzzles are simple, and provide some small item to lead to a quite possibly bigger puzzle to be solved. But (so far at least), each room’s puzzles must be completely solved, and the meat needed for the next day’s “special meal” must be found, before each room can be exited. Some items for the meal are optional, but the more you find, the more stars you receive for the quality of the meal when served. Presumably, the number of stars unlocks some feature(s) later on.\n\nAnd that’s something new, in my humble experience. Rarely have I encountered a puzzle game where each area MUST be solved completely for game continuation. As such, it will most likely need to be restarted FROM THE BEGINNING, including all the dialog involved, repeatedly. The good news is that once each room is solved, repeating is simple, if you’ve kept your notes and have a decent memory. (Yes, you will need to solve some puzzles with the help of paper and pencil.)\n\nBut more good news: the game includes some form of Walkthrough, yet to be investigated.\n\nEach day, having solved to puzzles in one room, you will take the ingredients you have found to prepare a meal….for one less guest. Presumably a larger puzzle opens as more guests are………served.\n\nI don’t doubt the repetition in “Rusty Lake Hotel” will prove a bit tedious, but quite likely there’s a good reason, yet to be determined. For full price, non-discounted, of $1.99US, I would give this game my NEXT TO HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION – 4/5.\n","January 30","true","2.3"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","38","46","3","5"

This does not affect my review.~\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=621537394\nTags: Adventure, Indie, Puzzle, Horror, Point & Click.\nOverviewYou are tasked with welcoming the newest guests to arrive at Rusty Lake Hotel. Every night you have to make a new dinner for the guests, collecting ingredients from their rooms. There are 6 guest rooms, each filled with puzzles that you have to solve in order to… kill the guests and collect their meat for supper.  Each of these rooms has a different soundtrack and puzzles, pertaining to the residing guest. The ways of killing are brutally creative. Sometimes it takes 20 minutes or more to solve the puzzles. You have to complete the whole puzzle in order to leave the room.\nThe guests start disappearing one by one; accompanied by a most delicious meal (a very delicious meal). Each time, the remaining guests enjoy the food without having a clue where it came from and not bothering to ask about the missing guest(s)… Unnerving if you think about it.\n\nShort list of pros/cons +Immersive soundtrack, varying from room to room\n+Simple but appealing graphics\n+Price is right\n+Fun puzzles that can be very challenging\n+Brutally creative ways of killing\n-Short: only around 2 hours\n-Nothing else bad to say: I was really impressed by the quality of the game and its difficult puzzles\n\nConclusion There is almost no reason why you shouldn’t buy this game, it’s only $2 and even cheaper on sale. Even with only a few hours of content, the surreal story and mind boggling puzzles make up for it. A must have for point & click fans.\n\n8/10: recommended for every day purchase at regular or sale price.http://store.steampowered.com/app/435120","February 11","true","4.2"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","17","22","2","0"

It's a shining example of how this Retro-inspired genre can have impressive graphics, a great soundtrack, polished controls/interface design, and an intriging plot that competes with other modern genres.\n\nSeriously, there's creepy Animal-Headed Hotel guests, a murder plot, macabre humor, challenging puzzles, and the whole package is totally addictive. Plus, once you're hooked, you can head over to their website and play the whole Cube Escape saga for FREE!\n\nCall me a fan, I am totally hooked! This game is a "Must Own" in my book for anyone that loves Point-&-Click games, and $1.99 is an absolute steal for it.\n\nNeed more convincing?

You can tell right from the introduction what you're going to be getting yourself into, but it's still rather delicious fun and a recipe for some brain teasing. The vast majority of the puzzles are self-contained in their own areas, so you don't have to worry about getting part A from room B after unlocking the door for room C with the key that you found in room D.\n\nIf I have any complaint it's that you essentially need a walkthrough to get everything because some of the requirements for 100% completion and even a few of the required solutions are bizarre and by no means obvious.\n\nStill, it's worth a few hours of your time for some wonderfully dark humor and simple yet charming art direction.","February 7","true","3.2"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","0"

The game is essentially a series of 5 puzzle rooms similar to Escape the Room-type flash games (which is what this developer is mostly known for), and while it isn't amazingly complex it's still relatively fun, and the interesting concept of the game helps keep it going. The only problem I have with it is that the story just leads up to a To Be Continued message, making this the sort of game that I wouldn't recommend unless you're more interested in the puzzle solving than the story. It's hard to deny the fact that this is a game that probably would've been free on a flash site a few years ago, but at least it has the courtesy to only charge $2, unlike plenty of other indie games of the same length.","January 31","true","2.8"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","1"

And I fell in love with this amazingly twisted, dark, puzzle-filled world. Everything in the game is beautifully constructed from the art to the puzzles (although that one water jug puzzle in the first room is so frustrating!) and while there were no notable jumpscares (as far as I noticed), the mood was constantly rather tense. Rusty Lake Hotel is a nice little point-and-click puzzle game that doesn't promise you miracles but delivers what it does promise really nicely.

Ridiculous, irrational things will happen. There’s not much of a story, nor is there engaging dialogue. If you’re willing to accept these facts, and ditch the sacrosanct rules of traditional point and click adventures, I think the game will be a delight for you.\n\nI wouldn’t call Rusty Lake Hotel violent or anything, but some events do occur that are macabre and unsettling. It’s not a game for young children, but for any other gamer who wants to experience a mind-f*ck, surreal casual adventure, I would strongly recommend this game.

And while I could say a whole lot, I'll try and keep it brief.\n\nFirstly, this is perhaps my favorite game from the Cube Escape series. It's hard to make that judgment considering how much I love every game in this series (as you might have noticed, my avatar is a screenshot from the recently-released Cube Escape: Birthday). But Rusty Lake Hotel does something special by bringing together elements - and characters, as you'll realize if you played the previous installments - from the games before it, and makes for a very intriguing, very eye-opening, very unnerving and unnatural experience.\n\nWhat do I mean by that last part? Simply put (and without spoiling anything), things get weird, and some would say gut-wrenching. The gameplay is similar to all of the games before it, as it should be, with the goal being trying to find particular items to accomplish the main objective. In this game's case, the objective is to find ingredients each night which will allow you to cook a savory dish for your guests the next day. A new element not previous in past games is the ability to find bonus items, which will allow you to get higher scores each day and eventually unlock something special in the end. The gameplay is, as always, thought-provoking and unnerving; mildly puzzling in some cases, moderately challenging in others. I guarantee you moments where you'll be grinning, gasping, and subsequently staring in disbelief at your screen in the span of minutes. It's the kind of game that makes you want to know more with each passing moment, and it fully delivers in the uncanny department. There were also parts where I was simply hesitant to act, knowing what would come; other times I was laughing at the ridiculousness of the circumstances, particularly the happenings in the room of Mr. Rabbit (Rest In Peace, valiant hare). All around, it's a game both chilling and absurd, enjoyable and brain-racking. All around, it's a great experience. I could complain about the problems I had with some puzzles, and my inability to collect all of the bonus ingredients, but I'd really only be expressing personal issues at that point - I'm admittedly dense at times in games like these, and so there's really nothing wrong here but my own lack of sight (or so I'd think). That being said, beware the water jugs.\n\nTo summarize, Rusty Lake Hotel delivers excellently for the first premiere game from the series. It keeps in line with the previous (extremely bizarre and difficult to understand) storyline and general style, while also introducing more through some new elements and abilities. It's plot is strange to say the least, but makes you want more - much more, in my case. The game gave me a couple hours of fun and frustration, and in the end left me jaw open and wanting a sequel immediately. If you're a fan of the Cube Escape series, point-and-click games, and dark, eerie, and morbid storytelling, then this is the game for you. And if you're not a fan of any of these, buy the game anyway; Rusty Lake Hotel will make you a fan.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game, and it's fully worth the price.","February 17","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The atmosphere and quirky setting really cements this as one of my favorite point-and-click puzzles games.\n\n\nPros:\n- Perfect difficulty; I never had to struggle long to complete a single puzzle nor. I am not a puzzle master by any means, and I was still able to complete the game without using a walkthrough.\n\n- Walkthrough provided; even though I didn't need it, there may be others who need help. The developers have provided a link in the settings window that takes you directly to a quick walkthrough provided by them.\n\n- Unique setting: I don't want to spoil it(although it's pretty clear early on), but the setting is a unique twist on the classic "strangers invited to an island in the middle of nowhere" premise. I really enjoyed it.\n\n- Atmosphere: The game executes atmosphere perfectly, balancing creepiness with quirkiness.\n\nNeutral:\n- Ending: The ending is not what I expected. After looking into it I realized that Rusty Lake Hotel is part of a series of games made by the developers, and the ending connects to elements seen in these other games. Luckily, all of these games are free, both on the iOS appstore and on their website. There are 7 total, and so far I've completed 4 of them. If you enjoy Rusty Lake Hotel then I really encourage you to play these as well. They expand on the game's lore and really bring the creepiness factor up a notch. I\n\nCons:\n- Built in flash; Not a huge con, but being built in Flash means right-clicking will bring up a menus. This is especially annoying when playing on a touchpad.\n\n\n\nVerdict: This game is very enjoyable, but for 2 bucks it's definitely a must-play. If you have any questions feel free to ask.","February 29","true","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The latest in the Cube Escape Series, this little gem has you playing hitman for Mr. Owl, the Hotel's "owner" and curator.\n\nFor the first time in the series, we are happily murdering the other characters. Are these actions our own? Perhaps. In the beginning, this seems like a harmless and pleasant visit to the Rusty Lake Hotel. Once the shrimp cocktails are dispensed, however, you get your first task. You must kill one guest each night until all of them are dead.\n\nYou are given no further information as to why these guests deserve to die other than they have "their own reasons for being here." Why do we trust Mr. Owl? Do we fear him? Does he compel us? There are no answers to these questions.\n\nIf there were a way to make hotel murder fun, consider this the game the one that makes the mold. The puzzles are challenging but fun. Walkthroughs are provided by the creators just in case you get stuck. More than once, I found myself laughing maniacally while carrying out my morbid tasks. There's a clever mixture of whimsy, humour, and horror in these games.\n\nEach room and character is unique. Each room has its own atmospheric soundtrack. The characters Mr. Owl and Mr, Crow are returning and familiar friends from the other Rusty Lake Games. Lastly, the games themselves seem influenced by Twin Peaks. For anyone who is a fan of the show, or the genre, this game is a must for the "owls are not what they seem."\n\nI hope you enjoyed my review and find this game as entertaining as I did. Hopefully, it will lead you to the other Rusty Lake games and join in the theory discussion as to the Lake's Purpose and just who is Mr. Owl?

First of all, people who develop games should NOT attempt to do their own voice acting. I don't know if that's what happened here but the line reads for the "Mr Owl" intro are horrendous and immediately gave me a negative impression of the game.\n\nThe art style is quite lovely, and the atmosphere is great. For the most part the puzzles are disappointing, though. There's very little logic or reason. Most of it boils down to "click randomly everywhere until a bunch of random things happen". There were a few exceptions and some of the puzzles were quite fun, but it's not fun to just click all over every screen and hope you find the "optional" items before you solve the main puzzle, because you never know which step will be the last and once you finish it you're kicked out of the room. If you didn't get one of the optional items, too bad because you can't go back.\n\nDo I recommend this? Hard to say. Bad voice acting, "puzzles" that aren't really puzzles, great artwork, cheap price tag.\n\nI guess if you're bored, it's worth a dollar or so if it's on sale. Otherwise, pass.\n\n","April 18","false","2.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

I start the game up. It's a damn tiny window in the top left corner of my screen. I attempt to move the window by dragging the top bar, but my mouse is stuck in the window. That's a little weird. Why would anyone want the game to trap their mouse in the windowed game? I hit escape to try to free the mouse, but nothing happens. I hit alt, control, tab. Nothing lets my mouse go from the game window's grasp. I try to alt tab, and it works. I click the top bar and move the game to the center of my screen. I attempt to drag the bottom corner to enlarge the window. surprise. clicking the window to move it traps the mouse. I alt tab, enlarge the window, alt tab to free the mouse again, and click the window a few more times as I try to get the window set up. I am a little upset. I invite someone to watch. The shift-tab screen is over top the game window. I can't click anything on the screen. my mouse is stuck in the screen but clicking the buttons does nothing. I am forced to task manager shut it down. Restart and do it all again. I foolishly think that there most be some options to change this horrid resolution and mouse issue. I click options; There are no options in the options menu. Why is the button even called options? I see there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ title bar on the app window. I attempt to click it but my mouse is trapped. I alt tab, and the game moves behind steam. I click on the icon on my start bar to bring it to the front. Even though my mouse never touched the game window it has teleported back into it's cage. Any interaction with the game traps the mouse. I alt tab and look though the menu strip options. There are no options here either. I start playing the game. It's a flash game. I click ♥♥♥♥ till ♥♥♥♥ happens. There is no relevant logic to 90% of solutions. This is all to be expected from a clicking flash game. Why would I ever trust a clicking flash game to actually try to be anything more that brain-dead ♥♥♥♥; developed by a monkey trapped in a room with a typewriter for an infinite amount of time with the idea that if he bangs his little monkey hands as fast as his little monkey arms can he can he will eventually make something resembling a game. The monkey has not yet made a game but in the meantime he managed to trick me into thinking I could stream a bad game over steam while some friends watched and it would be ok to laugh at. like a bad movie. Only, instead of watching the movie you get locked inside because by dumb luck that monkey managed to type in the setting that locks the mouse into the window. You ask yourself why the monkey would think that any program should have this "feature", but you then realize the monkey didn't think. Let's play pretend. Let's pretend that I didn't already think clicking games were garbage. You like clicking games, and you wan't to know if you would buy a clicking game. The answer is always no, but we're pretending. you're looking for engaging puzzles, yes? Well, the monkey is still working on that so come back never. I finished the deer room. The deer's room contains about a dozen different things to work though, and only two were puzzles. I need this deer's blood huh? So he wants a drink. First puzzle with weights and a scale gets me into the safe which contains a knife. So I stab the deer for- nope. So I need to poison him first I guess. I have to open this window and trap this moth with this glass. Then clicking the moths in this specific order which is conveniently on this nice painting of moths of the deer's wall gives me a seed out of the moths. why is the seed in the moths and why did clicking them give me it? Monkeys. plant the seed. Grow the seed by clicking it, because monkeys. grind the plant to make poison. mix it with water by doing some water puzzle, which is a puzzle because I can't poor water properly. Mix it with the deer's own blood and Tabasco sauce from milking antlers on the wall; Which can only be solved by order of; I haven't clicked on this yet so click it all over till things happen. I did it. You like clicking games. That's why you're here. So, the nonsense of it means nothing to you right? You like that stupid monkey garbage, don't you? Checkmate. Google clicking puzzle games, and play an infinite pool of copy paste uninspired garbage that won't hold your mouse hostage in it's poorly made app window. Oh sorry. What was I thinking. It's the future, and everyone knows that best way to make games is to google flash games and make as many generic re-skins and plaster them all over steam and your phone's app store. If you're the first one to steal an idea that used to be free and slap it on a new device for a price you could be the next angry birds. No work or original ideas needed! Perfect work for a monkey to made for other monkeys.

The point and click puzzle aspect is completely and utterely unintiuitive and I found myself looking at the walkthrough for every level. There are some things that you just don't expect to have to do, like going back to characters and winning incredibly hard puzzles. At one point there were three monkeys on a shelf, and you had to work out the pattern to click them in, but the pattern you had to do was like 10 clicks long. I would be willing to excuse this if the story were good, and it is, there is a sinister vibe throughout and the erieness is maintained. This, I thought would all lead to a climactic ending where all the mysteries the story gave you were solved. But boy was I wrong, it just ends on a "To be continued" screen. This lazy finish and ridiculous puzzles amount to a tedious game that has little going for it but atmosphere.","February 5","false","2.8"," 8 of 58 people (14%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","14","8","58","2","3"

I've clicked on every square inch of that room with the naked mouse, and every noticeable feature with every item you can pick up in that room.

That being said and since others already wrote enough about the content (point and click, surreal setting, a bit gorey, setting at a lake with anthropomorphic creatures that run that hotel and have tasks for you, solve riddles to proceed), here are my points of critique regarding the gameplay.\n\nFirst, the pros:\n- the game is entertaining. If you like point and click games, especially those leaning to the dark and surreal side\n- most* of the puzzles are logical and therefore, solvable by using your brain\n- the music is fitting and atmospheric\n- no pixel hunt\n- if you played the cube escape series, THIS game is where all open questions seem to start to fit together. Expect some cameos.\n- the game has some additional, optional puzzles that are a bit more difficult to solve (yay, extra challenges!)\n- you will get a reward if you solve those as well (yay, rewards for going the extra mile!)\n- for not even 2€, you get at least about 1 to 2 hours of entertainment, which is a good value!\n\nNow the neutral things (aka: things I'd like to see improved in further versions that catched my eye but didn't bother me that much):\n- the language needs some improvement to avoid involuntarily comical situations. The sentences spoken are very minimalistic (which is a good thing, since it fits the atmosphere nicely), but sometimes the grammar seems off or very simplified (I'm looking at you, evening initiating sequence)\n- there is one point where you are reminded where you currently are (the lobby) via a UI notification that pops up, states that areas name and has to be clicked to close. I found this a tad annoying since the area is not disorientating at all and it felt tedious to always close the notification without any benefit.\n\nOf course, that are only very minor issues. I did not find anything too negative about this game, except from maybe being a bit short.\n\nOther features:\n\nThe graphics are simple, but beautiful and very well fitting to the cube escape series. The sounds were fitting and subtle as well and provided to the atmosphere. Still suffering from deer-man related flashbacks (would recommend playing the cube series alone for this! Go and get your dose of trauma today! It's free!), I expected to be startled more often. In comparison to the other games from this developers, I found the Rusty Lake one literally placid, harmless even. There was a bit of gore, but sparsely (it's up to you if that's a pro or con).\n\nThere was an * to the notion of "most riddles are solvable by brainpower". Some few are not. Regarding the games of this developer, "logical" has to be a term to be stretched a bit. First, let's say: the WAYS to obtain or interact with something are logical - what exactly you will get from this interaction, needs not be. For example, you might spot a puzzle, do what you think you are supposed to do and solve it without much strain, but what you get out of this might be leaving you thinking "wtf". This is one thing that I enjoy about these games. And in this sense, most are logical and solvable. There were only about two riddles that were not exactly solvable by deduction but more by "doing things randomly and having something happen" - and this is what I meant. You can solve them anyway,  just more in the "I wonder what happens if..."-way.\n\nTo sum up: if you like point and click and a bit of a dark twist, go and play it, you probably won't regret it. But don't expect to be busy more than 1 or 2 hours with that game. If you want to maximize your experience, go and play all of the cube escape series games first. This should take several hours and a few minor emotional scarrings.

The puzzles are a little brainracking which is rather enjoyable, however there is an occasional need for a walkthrough to get 100%.\n\nAs it ends on a supposed cliffhanger I look forward to part two!","February 12","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Priced well, with a nice visual design. The puzzles are fairly designed; though what you need to do is sometimes a little out of left field, nothing is too hard to figure out. The atmosphere works well enough, and even though I found it less compelling than I'd hoped, it did actually get me at one point. If the surreal/nonsensical feel of the trailer piques your interest, then I'd say it's worth your time.","February 15","true","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

More or less your typical high-quality adventure/escape the room flash game.  I do mean flash game literally, the game itself is a .swf file that opens in adobe flash...Which is a little off putting when you buy something on steam.\n\nThe puzzles arent tear your hair out hard but they might be tough for any kids who might be playing (algebra is a must!) this somewhat spooky little adventure.  It's also the sort of game that has plenty of little secrets that you might want to keep a pad of paper and a pen nearby for.

In this game, you will prepare five excellent meals for your pleasant dinner guests.\n\nIf you have played any rusty lake games before you know exactly what is in store for you. I found the game fairly short, but thoroughly enjoyable. For the price, this game is worth every penny. Do not watch a lets play of this game, it will ruin the fun. The only problem I had was with flash and low fps when in fullscreen for some reason, but other than that it was perfect. I hope Rusty Lake continue to produce premium puzzle games, but maybe a bit longer in the future.\n\n9/10: Buy it and play it yourself, its about the cost of a cup of coffee and won't take too much of your time.
