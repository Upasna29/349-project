When I first played this game after so many years,  I was surprised to hear music and sound effects. I only had an internal speaker back in the day (beep boop!)  I love it, grab this game for a decent challenge.  It had fantastic framerate for it's time I might add.","January 19","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even though I'm supposed to press Fire to activate it.\n\nA decent, but slightly tedious game.

Alien Carnage.\n\nDon't ask me what this has to do with Halloween. Err...zombies?\n\nAnyway: You are Harry, a "red blooded American with balls of steel" (quoting Harry himself) who has to save other people captured by aliens so they don't have to be turned into mindless zombies and thus saves the Earth by doing this. A typical damsel-in-distress story in outer space - and with a flamethrower.\n\nIt's a 2D platformer: you run from left to right and from right to left, explore the level in order to find the kidnapped people. What makes the game a bit more challenging - and fun - is that the levels also contain doors for which you have to find levers in order to open them and you have to memorize the environment a bit so you find everything again, including the exit door. And you can't leave a level unless you've freed every single victim.\nHowever, in this game you don't jump - you use a jetpack to fly through the air and to upper platforms. Sounds cool at first but the jetpack is powered by fuel (which also powers the standard weapon, your flame thrower). So you always have to keep an eye on the fuel meter while looking for vending machines that sell fuel. This can be a pain in the a... sometimes.\n\nSpeaking of vending machines and weapons: You have other weapons, too, like missiles and bombs. They have their own vending machines. However: whenever you enter a boss level you only have your flame thrower so these stronger weapons won't make your life easy at any time.\n\nThe enemies in the game are poor on variety: Mostly they are green-skinned zombies, a few alien-like creatures but they don't really change during the whole game. In the last few levels there may be bigger zombies but still, I wish the game had more different enemies to fight. Still, they should give you the right horror/sci-fi movie feeling a bit at least.\nThe bosses are a bit more challenging because they take longer to kill but they take shorter to kill you. But there are no real strategies: just fly around them and shoot them.\n\nThe graphics are very fine for the time, music and sound are quite okay.\nYou can choose between three different difficulty options (easy, medium, hard).\nWhen it comes to save features: You can save and load several saving spots but they only memorize the beginning of the level. Inside the levels you have computers that you have to touch to save during the level. Whenever you die, you go back to the last computer, not to the beginning of the level. That's cool for a game of that time.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed playing this classic platformer from my past. It's quite a short game with could have used a bit more of variety but if you love 2D platformers and can stand a bit of horror then you won't regret trying this out.","October 27, 2015","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was too young to really articulate why, but after revisiting it, I think I can put it into words.  The game sucks.  Specifically, the level design is terrible.  Each level is essentially a maze with no flow, rhyme, or reason to it.  It's a series of identical looking hallways filled with the same few enemies over and over again.  There's other stuff that isn't very well designed, but what will suck your will to live, or at least will to play this game with those few fleeting moments you have before shuffling off this mortal coil, is the lack of interesting places to explore.  For an exploration-based platformer, that's kind of sub-optimal.\n\nIt's a shame because the technical aspects of the game are pretty good, and WAIT A MINUTE ABOUT THE LEVEL DESIGN.  Since the levels are non-descript, you'll have to trudge through the same hallways a few times while you find all of the hostages so you can go to the exit and go to the next level that is gray this time instead of brown.  So naturally, the enemies aggressively respawn, and you have limited ammo that needs to be refilled.  Also, your ammo is also your fuel, without which, you can't jump.  To be clear, this isn't actually hard, but it is really annoying.  It's like playing an old RPG where you're trying to find the exit to the dungeon and every four steps an easy random encounter sucks you into a different screen where you have to kill the same four cave rats over and over and over again.\n\nIt's like that.  But if you can get past how what you're actually doing in the game not being any fun, the game is fine.  18 stars!","May 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 18 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","4","18","0","0"
