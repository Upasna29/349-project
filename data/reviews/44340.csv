But I never tried that.\n- Bullet drops are accurate and satisfying.\n- Visuals still hold up okay, specially in later levels (I might be easy to please in this case). The mountains are neat.\n- Good length for the Single Player considering recent games in the genre.\n- The Briefing before any mission is nice. Really loved the soundtrack giving you a "danger" feel before going to battle.\n- Level of customization for different sets of classes. You can level them up and get new perks.\n- You can give orders to each soldier in your squad. It's great to flank enemy positions, suppress and ambush if you take the time to understand how it works.\n- No health regeneration. If you get shot you need to stop the bleeding first then patch up\n- You can get killed with one or two bullets.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- The AI is a hit or miss. Either they can be effective or they warn you to not shot because they are going to be in front of you. This happened more than it should.\n- It requires Games for Windows Live if that' is an issue/deal breaker for you.\n- Because the Story is focused on one area, there's not much variety when it comes to different war scenarios.\n- Checkpoint can be cruel at times considering how easy it is to be killed. Most of them are fine, however.\n- Responsiveness from your AI when you order them to enter a vehicle can be really slow.\n\nBest Knox quote:\n\n"I'm going to beat you so hard that not even Google will be able to find you."","May 27, 2014","true","14.3"," 179 of 200 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","179","200","0","4"

Finally, some action, I thought, and continued to think as we drove down the road, Staff Sergeant Knox jabbering in my ear in an incoherent stream of misunderstood military jargon and barely comprehensible profanity.  Eventually, we reached said town, and I disembarked with my men, charging into battle, finally free of SSgt. Nutsack as my three bot companions lingered by the humvee, refusing to move.  Fortunately, the enemy were similarly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and walked about in the open like cardboard cutouts of vaguely Arab people on a really crappy firing range, and despite my horrendously awful-looking rifle's attempts to make me miss by spontaneously making me stand still or jumping about due to a bird flying in the next continent, I was able to remove the threat.  Upon returning to the convoy, SSgt.

The original Operation Flashpoint was my favorite game in High School. Cold War Crisis (Now called ArmA X: Cold War Assault) was a brilliant milsim. It was a difficult and wonderfully rewarding experience.\n\nNow, this is where things take a turn for the strange. Codemasters and Operation Flashpoint's developer, Bohemia Interactive Studios, had a falling out. Codemasters owns the Operation Flashpoint license, so they name stayed with Codemasters. BIS went on to make Armed Assault: Combat Operations, or ArmA. The original ArmA (as in ArmA 1, not ArmA CWA) was lukewarm in reception. It had loads of issues upon launch. This left people wondering perhaps that Codemasters could make a better game. So, they tried with Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising.\n\nNow, simultaenously, BIS was going to try again with ArmA 2. BIS made a lot of good decisions and even released a demo of ArmA 2. ArmA 2 came out a few months before Dragon Rising. There were still complaints about performance issues, but over all ArmA 2 was a huge hit.\n\nDragon Rising received no demo before release. Infact, it got a demo a month after. Dragon Rising did feature a better performing engine than ArmA 2, but that was about it. The game even had a mission editor on PC, but it was inferior to ArmA's. In all, I actually enjoyed Dragon Rising a lot, but it's inferior to ArmA 2 in so many ways. The majority of issues that plagued it could be centered around the fact that it was a pretty weak console port to PC.\n\nNow, Red River is more of the same bad, but none of the good. I wish I could go into more detail, but Red River boils down to this:\n\n-Get briefed by a gruff Staff Sergeant\n-Scripted shooting gallery section with weak feeling weapons and the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ set of mouse sensitivity in an FPS. You need to have it maxed in order for your view in the iron-sights to have any usable movement. How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ were you, Codemasters?\n-Deal with dumbed down AI. Literally. Prick-in-Command Sion Lenton outright said the AI in Dragon Rising was "too good" at some points. The ♥♥♥♥ planet are you from? Now, enjoy being able to run through a door filled by a Tajik insurgent, get behind him, and shoot him in the back as he menaces you.\n-Get back in vehicles for additional banter.\n\nOne hallmark of Flashpoint, vehicle control, is gone. In a quote from ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ supreme Sion Lenton, he stated that "Marines don't fly"  despite the USMC operating the 5th largest Air Arm in the world.\n\nInstead, you're treated to a Call of Duty level single player and co-op experience.\n\nLiterally, it's pretty much Call of Duty single player.\n\nThis game is one you should pass on without a doubt.\n\nIf you want tacticool shooting, pick up any of the ArmAs, the original Ghost Recon, and Ravenshield.\n\nIf you have those and still want more, Dragon Rising isn't awful\n\nThis is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisawebpage/recommended/44340/","thisisawebpage","Satan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisawebpage/","67 products in account","Operation Flashpoint: Red River is kind of like a mixture of ArmA, MOH and Ghost Recon. You command your fireteam (like GR) except in a more complicated way similar to ArmA (stance, dispersion, noise dicipline etc.) There are ArmA features like bullet drop, the importance of stance when aiming, military jargon that is relevant to the task and some adherence to military tactics. The AI (unlike ArmA) are actually somewhat lifelike, and they behave much like the AI in say MOH BF3/4 and GR. Unfortunately, the environment isn't breakable (like BF3/4), however you can reduce buildings to rubble with high explosives but that is it. Suppressors aren't that useful because of the way the campaign is played (open ground and daylight) but fortunately they do not reduce damage like in some games. The weapons are rather innacurate, almost to the point that they are unusable. The M4A1 carbine is good for distances up to max 20m away (the ACOG magnifies too much). The M249E2 SAW is about the same. The MP5A4 is good for targets up to 10m away. The M14 is best with the Leupold Mk 4 because the ACOG sits too far forward on the weapon and the peripherals interfere. The M107 is useful for any range, but if targets are within 100m, then aim using the graduations above the middle of the crosshair.\n\nIn conclusion, I would recommend it to anyone. It's fun by yourself (the AI are competent) and fun with friends or even strangers (the online community are quite pleasant).","June 28, 2014","true","17.9"," 51 of 58 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","51","58","0","12"

Challenging, FUN and it's a pretty good baby of the dead genre: team-based military tactical shooters. There are a few quirks (like annoying anim-desynchro, which occurs rather rarely) and it shouldn't be called "Operation Flashpoint", but if You have some buddies to play with and miss some 'lighter" alternative for ARMA, it's a must-have.\n\nOverally:\nGameplay - 9/10\nVideo - 7/10\nAudio - 6/10\nReplayability - Decent\nValue for money - Good","November 30, 2013","true","56.8"," 61 of 75 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","61","75","0","0"

This game is totally different than the first Opflash. People should do  some research before purchase instead of blindly buying games then complain about them. This is not an open world or überrealistic  game. It's an arcade shooter just like COD or MOH.The graphics are not the best but they are totally okay. The optimization is not too  good, eats a lot of resources while the visuals are not too satisfying. There is one effect I really loved though - the sun flare. OMG this  game has the most beautiful sun flare I've ever seen! It's a real eye candy, I wish more games would have it. Overall the places are a  bit bland because you are somewhere in Tajikistan. This game was made for consoles anyway so yeah the maps aren't too interesting.  It has some nice lanscapes and nice sky though.\nThe shooting is really satisfying. It feels good to shoot with the rifles. Yes, only the rifles because there is no use of smg or shotgun.  The reason is simple: there is no close-quarter mission, there are no indoor missions and the enemy is in long range most of the time.  The gadgets are useless too. It takes ages to switch to a grenade, the tripmine has no use at all - the enemy is only approaching from  front most of the time.\nYou have to choose your class, I played it through with the scout class, you can unlock all kinda cool snipers and scopes. But you  can only attach the nightvision scope to a sniper, so you cant put it to M4 etc.\nThe story is... well I couldn't care less about it. I did not understand most parts because of all that soldier talk. I had no idea what was  an APC until I googled it. So maybe you would like the story if you are into military talk and all that stuff. The leader of the squad is an  assshole. He talks waaaay too much and the way he talks is very irritating. He is a wannabe-tough guy, really makes you say the n-word. Your sqad is quite weird. They are not too bright so it's recommended to play in coop with at least one human squadmate. They  are cute though. Many times they are rushing to heal you. But they never heal themsleves. So you may find yourself babysitting them.\nGiving them orders is useless. The only orders I've used is hold position and follow me. This game is not a tactical one. Doesn't matter  how bad it will look like a tactical game, it's simply not.\nThe game has some bugs, you will encounter some but for me they were funny most of the time.\nAnyway, the game is REALLY fun. After all those negative things I've listed it's a very good game I don't care what people say. I  enjoyed every bit of the game. I've played with a coop partner and it was very awesome. The game lenght was satisfying, the ending  was not.\nI really recommend it to all my friends to give it a try. The replayability is high, because you have the chance to max all the classes and  unlock cool weapons and perks. I've played it through as a scout, it was really awesome. If you are looking for a good coop game,  look no further. I enjoyed every minute of it (except mr.assshole's rambling). It's different from most of FPS games because this game is  representing the missions in a more realistic way. I recommend it to everyone who is sick of ww2 nazi killing clichés and want to play a cool FPS in modern setting.\nPS: The menu music is incredible.\n\nDEFEND DAT TAYLOR!","March 13, 2015","true","17.8"," 39 of 57 people (68%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","68","39","57","11","4"

The graphics are far from todays AAA titles but are in no way a hinderance to gameplay. Each class has an extremely different playstyle that I was completely surprised by because if you try to fill another role such as close combat with an automatic rifleman it will not work out as well as trying it in other class based games. The combat is fun but punishing and each kill is rewarded with not only class exp but a sigh of relief that it wasn't you who caught a bullet especially in close combat or urban areas. Teamwork is essential and without a team you are truly nothing against the enemy.

For once - it doesn't have regenerating health - instead, you bleed until you patch yourself up (and then use the the infinite medkit you have, but I guess life isn't perfect). The main problem with it is that it took on the name of a franchise reknowned for its focus on vehicle use and squad (i.e. 8-10 people) tactics taking place in a large open environment. People unfamiliar with the Flashpoint name wouldn't care if Codemasters just called it "Red River" and those who are ended up brewing a turn storm around the game.\n\nOther flaws include glitchy grapchis and overall shoddy optimization, but not to the gamebreaking level. Character models look nice, with lots of detail on the marine characters, missions take place across large patches of terrain, and although you are confined to a certain area battlefield-style, it rarely becomes an issue.\n\nMissions also sport long rides in the back of a humvee, where the only thing you do is listen to the tutorial voice in the form of your platoon's staff sergeant. These rides are tedious, but wrighting is decent and the guy is genuinely hilarious  at times (provided you've ever been in the military or are a fan of Generation Kill), and he reminds me of a sergeant in my old unit.\n\nSpeaking of Generation Kill - both this game and the previous one (Dragon Rising) rip entire dialogues straight out of the show - I guess they ran out of creativity half-way through writing the story.\n\nMost annoying of all - the AI. While friendlies can take a little getting used to, but once you get the hang of commanding them they can be made to function, the enemy AI all graduated from the Tajik special ed class and handed an AK - they either stand in the same spot doing nothing or run towards you. Taking cover is also an overly complicated concept for them. Not only that, but they take damage like a china teacup in a bull arena - you'll be lucky to kill one before he ♥♥♥♥♥♥ himself on a thornbush and bleeds to death.\n\nAll in all, the game feels very reminiscent of the Brothers in Arms games, except that actual terrain was used for the levels instead of them looking like a collection of conveniently placed chest-high walls. But I wish they ripped a few more elements off that franchise as well, like the gun accuracy and sway, and maybe the unlobotomized AI while they're at it.","May 6, 2015","true","19.3"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","75","21","28","5","0"

The game is more like MoH or CoD, in the sense that it isn't openworld, and the missions are very linear. Where it differs from MoH or CoD however is in the gameplay. Unlike you're generic FPS military game, you are not a walking tank that can run through the battlefield taking little to no damage whilst wreaking havoc on your enemies using an array of weapons. In OF you have 4 distinct classes, with different weapon setups, and by playing as the classes you can unlock different weapons to use and more customization options, none of which however are capable of running and gunning through the battelfield due to how easy it is to be killed. Even on normal you can get killed in as few as 2 bullets. Due to this the gameplay is a lot slower paced than other FPS games you may be used too, but it is still very enjoyable. Personally I found it a nice change from the standard FPS games. The story however is rather dissapointing. It's your standard military story where you are in a foreign country trying to restore peace by killing anything that moves, and overall the story is forgettable.\n\nNow one of the major downsides to this game is the need to install Games for Windows Live. Youll need to install the GFWL client seperatly from the windows/xbox site before being able to launch the game, and you will need to sign into an Xbox live account in order to play co-op/multiplayer and to be able to save your progress. It's important to note however, that the multiplayer and co-op is still functional despite GFWL not being supported anymore, which is a good thing since the game is a lot more fun to play with friends as the AI squadmates generally are not very useful.\n\nThe graphics have not aged well and even back in 2011 when the game was launched the graphics weren't that great, and the game isn't optimised that well for PC. With that being said though, the game is still a lot of fun to play, and has a lot of gameplay value, especially for its current low cost. I'd give OF:Red River a solid 7/10\n\nPS: The game plays a little smoother with a xbox controller over keyboard and mouse, but is still playable with them if you don't happen to have a controller. Also GFWL may not be getting updated anymore, but it works fine, so people should stop complaining about the game and giving it bad ratings based on this one thing.","August 1, 2015","true","9.9"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/glaciercold/recommended/44340/","glaciercold","Glaciercold","http://steamcommunity.com/id/glaciercold/","50 products in account","This game was on discount when I bought it. And yes, I did read several forum posts. There were loads of horror stories on the forum. However, I thought that three dollars wouldn't be a big deal right? I mean, Codemaster's a fairly well-known group; they won't screw up anything important, right? Oh boy, was I wrong...\n\nMy first 30 minutes was graced with a horrendous setup process, GFWL, DX installation, unintuitive interface. GFWL was particularly painful, this is simply a stupid choice for online gaming, there's a reason no other game uses it. Beyond that, I was frustrated with a soundless game and random crashes. It took almost an hour for me to get into the first level, and what greeted me was a satirical loading cut-scene with overly loud sound, a far-cry from my previous hour of silence. After that, the game just blacked out, no sound, no sight, nothing.\n\nFollowing my incredibly frustrating experience, I decided to contact the Codemaster support team. To my surprise, they responded within a day, not bad for a partially "defunct" studio. However, the response was short and extremely unhelpful. I was told to restart my game and replug my headset, something that I've done more times than I'd like to. At this point, I was ready to give up. My friend made the same purchase on the very same discount event, only to find the game failing to install, and later, incapable of starting up.\n\nI didn't even touched on the gameplay, graphics and storyline, but the hour I spent was more than enough to persuade me against my hastily made purchase. The game might be a gem, if it actually runs. But in my case, it clearly didn't.\n\n\nUpdate 1:\nAfter reading several other reviews and watching some gameplay videos, I am glad to not miss out any groundbreaking contents. Graphics and audio are generally the same as Dragon Rising, which is to say, 2009 technologies in a 2011 game. Gameplay itself suffers too, with less than optimal AI, linear level designs and poor weapon modeling. Lastly, the story is nothing to write (if there's any written in the first place) home about.

The campaign was solid and kept me wanting more and towards the end it got so intense and I grew to like the whole team. The execution was done really well, the weapons, levelling up and choosing the right guns for the right mission was fantastic. Especially having to do a fighting retreat but also it needed to be tactical and not just run back and randomly shoot. You need to carefully take your shots and have support and cover. The enemy can have seriously good accuracy and you don't just cop 20 rounds to the chest and regenerate like you're Wolverine. I would say that this game was an experience that was rare to find in this day and age. Great shooter, great gameplay, sound quality was solid and the voice acting was very good!","November 7, 2015","true","9.3"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

Before every mission there's a short briefing which is informative and skippable. But after that there's a second run-down of the plan where you get screamed at in military slang for what sometimes feels like 15 minutes by some racist black guy. Everything he says is completely useless, especially after already having gone through the first briefing, and you can't skip over this idiot.\n\nCombat is confusing and repetitive. While its nice to be able to order your unit around and have such an array of orders to give, I think you've been left in charge of the 'special needs' platoon. They're slow and often need you to input the same order multiple times. Further for combat, there is very little indication from which direction you're being shot. And when you're being swarmed with enemies, having every platoon ai screaming about gunners at whichever location doesn't really help.\n\nOverall, It runs well, although for a 2011 game the graphics look like garbage and probably don't require much anyway.

Operation Flashpoint has alaways been closer to a tactical military shooter than an arcade shooter like COD. The game tries to blur the lines between arcade and tactial, but fails to really do so. The commands are awkwardly placed on the CAPS Lock key and use WASD to issue. This means that to issue a command you have to completely stop moving, look at your target, hit an unusual key and than select your command. There's also no way to issue individual commands like in previous games. A common strategy is to place a heavy gunner, LMG, on suppressive fire, a sniper on overwatch and than send one soldier to flank right or left while you flank the other direction. However since you have to command the entire team the best you can do is supprese and you flank or send them one way and you go the other.\n\nAnother problem with the game is Staff SGT. Knoxx. I get that he's a Marine and the game is tryingto symbolize a military shooter but I've never heard anyone, Marine or otherwise, with as foul a mouth as him and I'm military. He began to irritate me right off the bat and never got better. It got to the point where everytime he started talking I just muted my TV so I wouldn't have to listen to the gutteral trash the developers think we talk like.\n\nCan I recommend this game?

You'll be fighting against terrorist hostiles in the desert, while also dealing with the People's Liberation Army of China.\n+ Story wise I would say the game is decent, but it doesn't feature anything out of the ordinary or ground-breaking. It's a pretty standard tale of U.S forces securing key objectives like dams and defending Fall Out Bases.\n+ As with the first title, Operation Flashpoint: Red River closely resembles a military simulator, so it's great for gamers who want to play tactically.\n+ Graphics are passable, not top notch in any respect, but reasonable.\n\n\nNegatives:\n\n- The guns just don't seem as fluid as the original game. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something is odd. The weapons just appear to be less exciting and more generic. The feeling you have when firing isn't the same as in Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. I'm not complaining about the realism of the weapons, they just have no charm. In Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising, they were both very fun to use and realistic.\n- Squad commands are once again a pain to initiate. Really poorly thought-out system that simply doesn't work as intended in the middle of shooting at enemies. Too time consuming and difficult to do. I finished the game purely by solo killing, with my teammates behind me providing default covering fire.\n- The game can start out slow, most of the missions aren't too engaging in terms of gameplay. While the new desert atmosphere is nice, it can also be a bit bland at the same time.\n- Game is short at 20 hours, although this isn't the worst length for a First Person Shooter I've come across.\n- Voice acting is kinda strange to be honest..just a little.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10\n\nOperation Flashpoint: Red River isn't a bad game. It's just not as good as the Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. It's shorter, the guns aren't as enjoyable, the environment is fresh and new, but it doesn't have the X factor that Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising retained. In the end, it's a game still worth purchasing, but definitely on sale.","December 7, 2014","true","18.1"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","13","23","0","0"

It is not superbly realistic like the Arma Series, and it has little RPG elements where you fight to gain XP to level up, and use that to improve your various combat skills like sprint, weapon changing, accuracy, scouting, and so on. However, it is a welcome change from the usual "blistering pace shoot everything" type shooter (such as Call of Duty Modern Warfare series, or the Medal of Honor series). You control Fireteam Bravo, one of the four marines in Tajikistan, where the US had gone in to take out the guerilla forces aiding the Taliban and Al Qaeda. You will have plenty of friendlies in the campaign missions (fireteams Alpha and Charlie) and various support elements (if any). You can play as one of four classes, rifleman, scout/sniper, grenadier, and autogunner/LMG, each with their "skills" and "weapons" and accessories to unlock. There are 10 main campaign missions, and they are quite long, with a lot of sub-objectives and waypoints. When you are done with those, there are "fireteam engagements" (your fireteam against everybody else) you can play. Generally AI handles the other 3 team members, but if you want multiplayer other players can take over those 3 slots. Graphics are quite good, and campaign missions are quite good, if a bit on the difficult side, as even on easy you WILL get killed A LOT and not knowing where you did wrong. All in all, if you crave a "realistic" shooter and can't stand Modern Warfare you may want to give this one a try.","April 28, 2013","true","44.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I bought the games because I like realistic shooters, and with this they made it more COD like. Movement feels sluggish and akward, and it feels like a slight delay between the klick and the shot. But worst of all, ranges as decreased to point blank. Flashpoint went from engagements at long range, where you recieve accurate hostile fire, where you have to effectively use cover, and provide accurate counter fire, to high phased running through small areas wehere getting kills are more reliant on speed and quick reaction. You rarely get to see hostiles at ranges above 100 meters, and the enemies wont shoot at ranges over this either, not that it matters anyway, you're safe, they can't hit a barn door.\n\nIt does however allow you more choices with your own gear, and choose what class/role you want in your squad. And it does ofc have improved graphics and stuff. Butt all in all it dosen't live up to the previous game.","April 22","false","3.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

You fight and feel as part of a platoon in the campaign.\n+Campaign is actually very interesting and as a semi-sequel to Dragon Rising, really succeeds at sucking you into the story and the action. It is a MAJOR improvement off of Dragon Rising (Which I can't remember a god damn thing about.)\n+Good characters. There is at least one character you will never forget after playing this game, and several other interesting ones with their own distinct personalities that you'll hear plenty of throughout the campaign.\n+Combat is fluid and as realistic as this series has ever tried to get. This isn't as realistic as ArmA, and this isn't as Arcadey as battlefield, but that's because this doesn't try to be either. This is a good in-between point of those who can find no joy in either.\n+Fireteam Engagements allow for extra gameplay after the campaign\n+Player Progression system awards you for doing the best you can on all missions and for completing as many secondary objectives as you possibly can.\n+Class Setup module allows you to fully customize the loadout of your entire squad before going into a mission.\n+Compared to Dragon Rising, this game features HUGE maps with improved grapihcs that allow for long and intense missions. You really feel like you're fighting in one country rather than several "maps" as you fight along a road from one border to another.\n\n-Windows Live. Sigh.\n-Did I mention this uses Windows Live?\n-Lastly, the WORST part of this game? It uses Windows Live.\n\n\nSeriously though, this game is AMAZING and so very worth the full price. On sale? Even better! This is a game that many will pass up, but you definitely won't regret paying for once you get past that first Windows Live login screen.

I'd say it's like Call of Duty action, crossed with the squad strategy & movement of Brothers in Arms, but its rather over-complicated compared to Brothers in Arms...\n\nEnemy AI tend to just run out in the open... The shooting is smooth... a little too smooth like the firearm was lubricated by dipping the whole thing in a barrell of oil, even the sounds of the rifle sounds like it has supressor on it...\n\nThe graphics aren't too shabby, better than some games I've seen lately... the sound is pretty basic, kind of gives you a headache... The attitude of the fellow American soldiers was rather irritating, typical gun-ho 'murica if you ask me... and that annoying black guy that sits on his ♥♥♥ and does nothing and constantly drills you with insults.... Seriously... there should be an option to disable him.\n\nOverall... it's not a terrible game, but I'd say it's especially for people who prefer the older 2000-2005 arcade style shooters...

I think it wants you to use a controller:\n\na) You have to press enter in the menus to accept things, rather than clicking accept or escape or something.\nb) To change your loadout in the menus you need to use the mousewheel (?!?!) rather than simply clicking on things. This also isn't stated, so it took a while to figure out.\nc) You have to use the keyboard to navigate, rather than the mouse.\n\nThe game itself is also based entirely around a controller:\na) If the mouse sensitivity is anything higher than 1/10 then moving the mouse causes the screen to do about 50 360s.\nb) Even on 0 or 1 the mouse has insane amounts of mouse acceleration, meaning I could hardly aim in the right direction\nc) The FOV is like 50 or something. Which, combined with the super-yawing mouse input, means you'll never be able to see anything\nd) The game uses a radial menu for squad commands.... but rather than navigate it using the mouse, you need to use WASD!!!! It's really hurt my brain to try and use that input method to give commands.\n\nThe game itself is also a barely interactive shooting gallery. Be prepared to spend 8 unskippable hours in a truck with an angry and degrading NCO, and a few moments in action commanding around your fireteam who can barely walk in the direction you tell them.\n\nIt also uses GFWL, which was a pain as I couldn't log in for ages (I had to use a separate 'app password'. GFWL didn't tell me this).\n\nI tried to get a refund I found this game so bad, but I'd forgotten that I bought it yesterday in a humble bundle for $2. The game is so crap that I kind of want a refund on the entire bundle now as it's tainted..","November 27, 2015","false","0.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

For example, looking around in a vehicle using the mouse is difficult as the camera constantly tries to revert to its default position (which makes sense if using an analog stick, but not with a mouse). There is also a substantial amount of mouse acceleration, making aiming extremely awkward and difficult. Menus are clunky - console like - and are meant to be navigated using the arrow keys and enter instead of the mouse.\n\nGraphics-wise, the game is unimpressive, especially for a 2011 game. There is heavy pop-in of vegetation, low quality textures, and excessive amounts of blur.\n\nAI is dumb, especially your teammates which do practically nothing. They only come in handy when you get shot and need healing. The gameplay as actually quite linear, and not nearly as open-ended as it might seem. The large scale of enemy units in many cases can make for some entertaining shootouts, but by the end if actually felt much more like Call of Duty than a military simulator.","February 2","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The enemy AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and its just not COD. COD does COD good, this does not do COD somewhat well. I actually feel like playing Ghosts, WAW, MW1, or any of those instead of playing this.\n\nThe story dousn't make much sense, its just a jumble of words and happenings but the really cool thing is the videos that show the events leading up to the game. This was cool in DR aswell. Hire that guy who did that for more stuff cause thats cool in my book but take the writers to serbia and remove them. Probably take most the programming team with them. And the publishers.\n\nThe point being its basically another modern and so real FPS games instead of trying something really interesting and new but atleast it works more than that WW2 game on the Arma 2 engine. By works I'm not even sure how to explain that, but I in what I played atleast the missions didn't just break or glitch to be uncompletable. You just wouldn't want to complete them because they suck.\n\nTL:DR\nGame sucks, just buy a real Call of Duty.","April 14, 2014","false","1.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Especially Ssgt. Knox. He's gotta be the most badass snco ever! I like the way he gives you "words of encouragement" before and during each mission. This game has some pretty accurate usmc lingo, like the mention of the infamous "Green Weenie". I got a laugh out of that. Gameplay wise, your team is not the smartest bunch, but they do help you get the job done. The enemy ai on the other hand is straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. They just come at you in hoardes to make up for this lack of intelligence. I ve seen some enemy squads just stand there while i aimed a well placed m203 round in the middle of their formation and just saw them evaporate into mist. The rifle ballistics id say are pretty spot on, as you get some bullet drop the farther out you try to shoot, and your rounds impact in a small cone of death as you try to engage the enemy. Afterall, these are government issued rifles the game replicates, not some high speed match grade rifle. So accuracy is good enough for government work. Also if you are a fan of bands like megadeath, drowning pool, and disturbed, then you are going to like this game as well. If you can get past the gameplay quirks and appreciate to small details in this game relating to the Marine Corps, then this is a good game. I would recommend this game to tactical shooter fans, Marines, and anyone else who like rock and or metal bands.","November 3, 2015","true","12.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Maybe custom in this case isn't so good. The plot is, in my opinion, static and generic. You are a United States Marine deployed in Tajikistan to combat the insurgency there. You first breath in the game has SSGT. Knox greeting you. By greeting you i mean talking large amounts of dung and insulting your intelligence and you AI brethren. He does not say anything useful for the tutorial on the FOB except foul bigotry that i just can't imagine any Marine treating his squad mates, especially in a combat scenario. The plot turns over and you end up in the back of a canvased humvee with Mr. knox... He has the floor for more foul speech that Codemasters might of expected to "pump up" us Americans. But it actually was not anything that i would recommend, Unless it's around five dollars. On the flip-side, This game at least attempted to pull the line away from the mindless run-and-gun antics that Call of Duty has established in the shooter market.

Came back to it today to try again, except this time I only completed the firing range exercise before mothballing the game.\n\nThe shooting feels extremely stiff and very unrealistic. For example, no scope sway when zoomed in, noticible delay in clicking the mouse button to fire the pistol and when the gun actually fires. The sensitivity slider doesn't seem to do hardly anything at the lower levels, so get ready for some epilepsy-inducing spinning. Funny thing, at this sensitivity, taking aim and moving the reticle is extremely slow and almost requires you to readjust the sensitivity much higher to be combat effective at all.\n\nMovement also feels very strange. You can only sprint straight ahead, no running at an angle.  Transitions between prone, crouching, and standing are very dramatic and cutscene ish. If you accidently hit the prone button while in a firefight, get ready for 4 seconds of transitions to stand up again.","June 30, 2014","false","3.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It's a mediocre co-op squad-based shooter with GFWL in it that has Taji insurgents. And chinese. And that's about it. Expect your usual fist-pumping 'MURICA dialog with this one, especially with your staff sgt., who will NEVER shut up about his 10 rules, which are basic common sense, and whose voice i recognize from Sazh in FF XIII. The fact that dude was swearing... like Sergeant Hartmann off Full Metal Jacket made me think the Taji insurgents ate his baby chocobo.\n\nIt has a lot of squad commands but it's not like you'll need them anyway, the game can be beaten easily with you going lone wolf sniping everyone despite the game itself telling you that if you do that, you'll end up easily dead.

But, as expected, it then crashed and would not load up again.\n\nThen once again, a random occurrence, it loaded again and didn't crash!

I could only play the game in a tiny window. But I still wanted to check it out, so I played on.\n\nAfter numerous lengthy unskippable cutscenes, with a plethora of unnecessary curse words slipped in every sentence, I actually started shooting some bad guys!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/recommended/44340/","excruciate","Excruciate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/excruciate/","717 products in account","Codemasters started a new side studio called "Codemasters Guildford" to handle making these two Operation Flashpoint games, and they sucked so bad that Codemasters shut down the studio and went back to focusing on their racing games.\nGot this and a few other games at humblebundle for $1 to try out. This was such a bad experience that I am not even going to bother with the other game, Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising. Out of the hundreds and hundreds of games I've played since becoming a PC gamer back in 1997, there are only a few games that I have ever quit playing and uninstalled within 30 minutes, and this is one of them.\nFirst, I can without even the slightest hesitation say that this game has some of the worst voice acting of all time. It is cringe-inducingly bad. It is so bad it made me physically ill.\nThis games problems start right away. It is immediately obvious how bad this game is when you start by doing nearly five minutes of riding with your squad in a humvee while a guy talks the ENTIRE time, enough to fill five pages of a book. He just very monotonely drones on and not one single word he says is of any importance whatsoever, just incredibly, mind jarringly annoying. After what feels like twenty minutes rather than five, you get out in a little area and get to kill two guys, then five more minutes of driving and him talking nonsense until your ears bleed. You get out in another small area & kill a few more guys, then five more minutes of driving and you get to assault a small town. In the middle of the assault is when I had enough and alt+f4 out and uninstalled. First off, that insane amount of riding in a humvee is unneeded. The guy rambling the entire time talking more than anything I've ever heard, even more than in a Mass Effect game, is uncalled for.\nAlso, the gameplay is like something out of a paper cut-out book. My rifle barely moved when I fired it, the sound was bad, sounded like a kids toy gun, when your bullets hit an enemy it feels laughably uneventful and generic, the sight aim sensitivity blows, and the squad command menu is without a doubt completely unnecessary and is just a burden. The basic things you can tell your squad to do are things that are automatically done by the ai in any good game because they are basic actions that should be automatically programmed into the game for the AI, but here are left out to make you feel like you are giving them strategic commands, lol. It's like they said "the game's AI isn't finished yet so we gave you commands to do it yourself".\nWhere Battlefield 3 would be a 8 or 9/10, this game is like a bottom of the barrel, stripped down, generic, awkward copy of BF3 and would at best be a 3/10. BF3 is a guy with a 20,000 dollar suit on and this game is a homeless guy laying in his own p1ss in the gutter begging for booze money. Codemasters' Dirt games, more specifically Dirt 3, is one of the most well made racing games I've ever played. I do not know what they were thinking trying to make this garbage horse crap of a war fps game, but they would have been better off not doing so. Especially since they took a hit on these games financially and shut down the side company they started in order to make them. lol again.\nTo this game's credit, as god awful as it is, its engine is still astoundingly better than ARMA 2's, lol. But then again, Asteroids for Atari has a better game engine than ARMA 2 so that's not saying much.\nAnyone who actually likes and spends any time on these two Op Flash games is probably a recluse with no sense of human interaction and a horrible taste in games and should stop wasting time and kill themselves quickly.","November 7, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

(Like their toe nails)\n\nThe sound glitch that everyone is talking about is not really a sound glitch, it is the radio turning on or off when your in proximity to the person speaking.\n\nThe game is not what the developers promised, or what everyone expected (if you just happend to be waiting for the game), but it is still a good game if you give it more than ten minutes. Believe me the first hour of the game is the most painfull, but then you start learning how you could have done it better.\n\nAs for the replayability.\n\nYou have 4 classes each with about 20 unlockable items.\nand you have skills to upgrade, like (sprint, endurance, vision, rifle handling etc.)\nAnd of corse you would want to do it better.\n\nBut if your the type of guy/not guy who has a thousand games that you want to play, you will not enjoy this game.","February 1, 2015","false","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not as good as the previous games but it's still worthy of the OF title. If you are looking for realism and more simulation, play ARMA. OF is no match to ARMA. OF is the younger brother of ARMA.

However, it turned out to be a really cheesy let-down, which really upset me after recently playing the previous title (Operation flashpoint - Dragon Rising) which was released two years before this game. The graphics are garbage compared to the previous game. The voice acting is cheesy, stupid, and annoying.\n\nOverall, this game feels like a bad version of an early Call of Duty game. I think the developers screwed up by moving away from the realism and simulation feeling which was present in Dragon Rising. Rather than feeling like your part of the action, you instead feel like you’re part of an interactive movie with really bad directions.\n\nThis game is ok to play, but I can't really stand more than a mission or two per day, whereas I can play most other shooter campaigns for hours on end.\n","January 21, 2015","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's similar and different from Dragon Rising in some ways. We all know "how big success" was the OFP sequel at the moment of release. If we're rated it as next Operation Flashpoint it was bad game. If we treated it as another military shooter it was quite nice FPS with some fresh solutions.\nMechanics is almost the same. I've got feeling that they've improved only balistics of rounds and gave us really nice "Character development" option.\nMissions are bit different from those from Dragon Rising. Everything looks more realistic. We're only small part of small operations. No more four-men diversions on the back of whole Chinese army. We're defending one of the village entrances, attacking enemy emplacements from the side or just protecting convoy at one of the grids.\nIf you're bored by saving world against Russkies or Middle East Dictator it's game for you.\nFresh and real (as real as game could be) view at war.

At first (and on low graphics), the game looked to be a scripted and buggy version of what looked like the original Flashpoint. After some long-needed upgrades, the game now ran stable (for about 1 day), and was mediocre overall. While some things like weapon drop and overall 1st person movement feel good, the enemy AI and the inability to re-sight in weapons leaves me wanting to go back to ARMA. It feels so close to being REALLY good, and yet it just isn't there. Not to mention, GFWL is extremely bad.

And action shooter with some tactical elements such as squad commands and thats about all for the tactical side really. You must go up against a larger force and use your squad to over come the odds because they will be stacked against you every time. Or play with friends and laugh your ♥♥♥ off when the AI or the game's engine do something messed up, which is not game breaking but its still funny when it does happen.","January 1","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
