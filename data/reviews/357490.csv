The trailer is a good representation really. It's story-heavy and the puzzles aren't particularly taxing although I did get stuck at one point because an obstacle wasn't really an obstacle. Its main goal seems to be humour, and it made me laugh a lot so it's done its job! There's even a joke in the options screen that made me chuckle.\n\nIt looks like a programmer has drawn it in MS Paint. Mostly that's fine, it's a comedy game after all, but the characters do look a bit out of place being so pixelly. The voiceovers are fine I think, though I'm not picky.\n\nTook me about 3 hours to play through - there are achievements you could aim for, but I'm not really interested in replaying to get them. I enjoyed playing it once, but a second time wouldn't really add anything.","March 12","true","3.1"," 27 of 43 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","27","43","0","0"

I laughed more with this $5 game than with many $50+ standup comics...\n\nAproximate quotes:\n- ATTENTION PLANET, PREPARE FOR PENETRATION! [Female pilot goofing arround on loudspeaker, toward what she believes to be an uninhabited planet]\n[Planet gets poundered. Turns out planet was inhabited. Hostile reply from the planet population, who refer to the ship as a "Death Machine".]\n- Our first impression could have been better. [Onboard computer pointing out the obvious on a unemotional voice.]\n\n- Don't you think it's unsafe to store missiles in a living complex? [Engineer]\n- Nope! [CEO]\n\n- What are you cooking? ... Seriously, smells like something died in there. [Engineer to the Chef]\n\n- Come on! I have to clean the bathroom after people get to eat your food!

That being said for the price I can't not recommend this game. Its fun, slightly funny (off beat humor) and casual as can be.\n\nPros:\n1. Easy to learn controls\n2. Slight humor makes some more tedious tasks enjoyable\n3. Best 16-bit graphics that 32-Bit can render\n4. FUN!!\n5. Price\n\nCons:\n1. No widescreen options limited to 4:3 ish scales\n2. Cut Scenes\n3. Limited controls for volume, screen, and controls (once again point n click)\n4. Has option to mute commentary (not Bad) but then I have to read all the Voices aloud when I'm let's Playing it.\n\nOther than that I have thouroughly enjoyed playing the 1st ACT and am looking forward to checking out the rest of the game!!","May 15","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What I played was an 8 bit movie that pretends to be a game.  If I wanted to sit and watch something, I'd go and just turn on the tv.  Games aren't the place for this sort of thing.","March 12","false","0.5"," 43 of 110 people (39%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","39","43","110","5","6"
