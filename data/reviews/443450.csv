"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/443450/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3112 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDeveloped by French based developers Piranaking and based on also French comic book Lastman Last Fight is essentially the Power Stone game we have been waiting for Capcom to make for the last 16 years.\n\nBack in the days of the Dreamcast the original Powerstone was one of my favourite games. It was different to pretty much all other fighting games at the time and was an absolute blast to play. The sequel inventively names Power Stone 2 added an extra 2 players and actually in my mind was not quite as good but overall I have been aching for a threequel for a good decade and a half.\n\nWell Capcom aren't going to give me what I wanted but alas Last Fight seems like it is going to give it a damn good go. The game sees you in an arena with full movement and the ability to pick up and use weapons as well as fight. As Powerstone power-ups appear that when all connected transform you into a stronger special character that generally leads to you destroying you opponent.\n\nThe story mode follows Duke Diamonds or Richard Aldana in a mission to save Richard’s girlfriend who have been kidnapped by a secret organisation amongst an epidemic of drug crazed rioting. Its pretty silly but fits the theme of the game well.\n\nThe cast of 10 characters features a nice wide range of characters from aliens, to hobos, to goat faced businessmen but generally playing as them is pretty similar and there is not a massive diverse range of abilities. There are 4 different transformations to experience and these radically alter the style of play and are all pretty different. Some are better than others but all were fun to be and were always a key part of winning a fight.\n\nThere are a number of different weapons to also pickup most of which are simply used to throw at your opponent but there are a few things such as rocket launchers that add depth to the gameplay. One of the biggest gripes I have with the game however is that there is just not enough in the way of difference amongst the stages with most being square arenas not filled with an awful lot. Powerstone had a lot more things to interactive (or at least I remember it having) and the game could definitely do with a few more things to play with in the stages.\n\nThe game however is great fun especially when played with friends. Currently there is only local multiplayer available which is a shame and as is the case with most indie games there probably never will be online multiplayer but if there ever was a case for using Nvidia’s screen share feature this is definitely a good one.\n\nI have generally enjoyed playing LASTFIGHT and it evokes a lot of fond memories of Powerstone. Sure it’s not perfect but it’s a fun game that is worth playing for all fight fans and fans of Capcom’s aforementioned Dreamcast Brawler as its probably the best you are going to get and at £10 you really can't go wrong.\n\nPlease checkout our video feature on the game here:  LASTFIGHT video feature[www.thegametutor.co.uk]\n\nA KEY WAS OBTAINED FREE FROM THE DEVELOPERS BUT MY OPINIONS ARE 100% MY OWN","May 19","true","8.5"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","28","34","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackBlitzkrieg/recommended/443450/","BlackBlitzkrieg","BlackBlitzkrieg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BlackBlitzkrieg/","97 products in account","This is actually a better Power Stone Love Letter Than I initially thought.\n\nWhile I wasn't a fan of the characters or the inital art design, the gameplay is a solid nod to the original Dreamcast party fighter. The addition of a dash and block are good but I hardly used them since I'm coming from the school of Power Stone where those things were an illusion. Controls feel ok but a tad loose. I can't explain it only that it doesn't have the snap of Capcom's aforementioned fighter. Also you're essentially doing what you did in Power Stone, collecting three maguffins to become a super being and reigning down pain on your opponent. Kinda wished I knew that going in. Also regardless of who you are you can only tranform into four monsters from what I can tell. They have interesting powers and they definitely turn the tide of battle which to some extent helps with balancing but the uniqueness of the characters doesn't get a chance to shine through.\n\nAlso the UI is missing some things for the sake of simplicity I wish would just get added instead. The Stone Counter and Radar I wish was present so it's a tad more obvious who has what stones and where they are on the maps. Items aren't nearly as diverse as Power Stone's Gallery but there are some interesting ones ala missles, boxing gloves and a helmet that gives you Zeus' Lightning. However, they're also stage specific. The stages themselves are an ok romp. Some are simple stages and some up the ante with hazzards that make you think of Power Stone 2 but you're still relagated to one arena.\n\nThe story was both good and bad. It's good in the sense that it doesn't take itself too seriously and is actually pretty funny. There's story transitions that last under a 40 seconds per fight so it's really quick but there are only two character campaigns in a roster of 10 characters. That's kinda sad man... Also the story has a very spotty anti drug message that seems to get lost in the fact that you win fights by taking the very same drugs you're mad at everyone else for taking.\n\n\nAlso, I kinda wish there was a tutorial. The game is simple enough to jump in and go ham but the AI starts doing some high level business that you kinda wish you could pull off.\n\nAll and all, this is a solid effort but it does need a tad more in the area of content for my liking. It's essentially a party game but I'd like to see the developers make more with it. I'm not sure it's done enough with the license to make me start going after LASTMAN as a series to follow and I do wish there was more content on display.\n\nI will say that getting it for it's $13 price is decent if you can part with that much for a bare bones brawler, especally if you're itching for a Power Stone fix. Otherwise, wait for a sale that takes a tad more off the top. If you can get it for $12 or less I can definitely recommend. The game is good but it shows potential to be better.\n\n","May 19","true","1.4"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

It is fun and casual-like, anyone can enjoy this game even if you're not a pro at fighting games.  I highly recommend this game.\n\nGameplay is fairly straightforward and with simple controls, you have:  attack, special attack, grab dodge, jump, block and dash.  There are no special inputs that you need to do to pull off combos they are all preset, so you just keep tapping the attack button and the character will pull off their unique moveset.\n\nWhat makes this game unique is there are items in the game that spawn and you can throw them at players.  There are also powerups that you can grab and transform into a super being for a limited time and wreak havoc.\nEach character in this game are all unique, you will definitely find a favorite.  The stages are well designed and are fun to fight in.\n\nThe replay value lies in the versus mode, you can team up with bots and fight against bots.  Just start a game and start brawlin to the death.  The story mode is VERY short, I completed it in 20-30 minutes, and there are only two characters with story missions.  They are pretty much the same fight-wise\n\nI have no gripes with this game.  All I want is more characters, modes, and stages.  From a hours to money standpoint I would say you will get your money's worth if you have friends over.  Playing solo can get tiring and not really worth it at full price.\n\nI hope this review was helpful.","May 19","true","3.8"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

It has a lot going for it, mostly I crave for a game similar to Powerstone. A really amazing art style and diverse cast. I kind of wish there was a bit more variation in dropped weapons and maybe larger levels to roam around, plus more unlockable things. It is a bit tough going back for more knowing that there is no online multiplayer for now since it really is a game to be enjoyed with others (there is local multiplayer but most of my friends are online), though here is hoping it is included later down the road.\n\nI still have to say I am in love with the design.","May 19","true","1.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","9","11","2","0"

There are small touches of interactivity but nothing like the game that inspired LastFight.\n\nOverall, is a really good game, absolutely worth its price. But if you are expecting it to be better than PowerStone, it's not. But it's freaking excellent anyways.","May 19","true","1.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

Overall, the game is most fun with a group and after playing Story Mode a few times, I unfortunately don't see myself playing much more on my own without a group.\n\nIt's a pretty straight forward brawler with throwing items, blocking, dodging and super mode after collecting three gems.\n\nThere is story mode playable by either of the 2 main characters and multiplayer (1v1 or 2v2 with AI bots).  There is no online play so it's most fun as local multiplayer.\n\n+ Dodging and Blocking (perfect block recovers HP and pushback) allow for more skill based combat\n+ Super form after collecting gems is specific to the level so nobody has a particular advantage\n+ AI bots can be added if you don't have exactly 4 players\n\n- No Online Play\n- No FFA mode\n- Maps are all square with minimal interaction and no progression / movement\n- Some of the Super forms seemed easy to avoid or dodge and there's no meter showing long you have left in the form\n\nI wish this was Power Stone 3 but to be fair it also didn't cost as much as Power Stone 1 or 2 so for the cost, it was worth the buy for me.","May 22","true","3.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is very much inspired from Capcom’s Power Stone. It's a pretty fun game. The color schemes, graphics, dialog etc. will remind you of a 70’s flick. The story mode revolves around the good ol’ “rescue your girlfriend from the evil people” plot.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game’s graphics look superb with a sort of cartoony look yet it’s a bit different. The characters and the environment have a clean look art-style to them. Like there is not much details on anything but everything looks so sharp and neat, almost like cel-shaded.  I liked these graphics a lot. The game is a bit demanding, I had quite a few FPS drops during my gameplay but setting the graphics quality to high from Fantastic fixed those issues. So if you want to play the game at the best settings you better have a good PC, though there shouldn’t be any problem for lower end pc’s to play the game at low or even normal graphics presets.\n\nSound:\n\nThere’s plenty of sound tracks in the game and they’re very nice to hear as well. The music sounds like 70’s fast paced almost pop-like music. The character voices, and other sounds are pretty solid too.\n\nGameplay:\n\nYou can play local co-op or play the story mode. The story mode starts off with 2 characters. You get to play with either Duke or Richard. In between each fight there are cut scenes and some of the story unfolds. Both the characters’ story is same but some dialog/cut scene will vary depending on who you play with.\n\nOther than story mode you can co-op with friends and play 2 vs. 2 matches which can be extremely fun. You can also play the versus mode with AI if you don’t have any friends hanging around and you feel like playing. The game is basically a very fun party game in versus mode. The controls are fully rebindable so you should have no problem setting up with friends.\n\nThe fighting mechanics are pretty simple. You can pick up and throw objects and they respawn so you can do it all over again. There are also power pickups and weapon pickups, e.g. you can pick up the Spartan (I think) helmet and it’ll transform you into Zeus and give you lightning attack for a short while. Pick up weapons like a rocket launcher which you can use to blast your opponent, boxing gloves etc. Picking up different power ups at the same time can also transform you into a much powerful character and you can wreak havoc.\n\nYou have a dash ability which you can use to dodge objects thrown at you. You also have a grab ability which you can either use on objects to pick up and throw at enemies or grab the enemy themselves and throw them. You can also block. When blocking, a bubble surrounds your character and the damage enemy does is blocked, timing it correctly can save you from a brutal punishment. Your character can also jump which is used on stages with multiple steps etc. There’s a total of 10 characters and 8 stages. Every character and stage have their own unique weapon/object pickups and abilities, though most characters feel very similar to each other in playstyle.\n\nA short gameplay of the first story mission can be found below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=698826741\n\nGraphics: 9/10\nSound: 8/10\nGameplay: 8/10\nOverall: 8/10\n\nConclusion:\n\nA very fun party game, the story mode is also nice but sort of short but the game’s real strong suit is the versus mode which can be endless amount of fun with friends or even AI. If you like Power stone and like fighting games in general, you will love this game.","June 6","true","1.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
