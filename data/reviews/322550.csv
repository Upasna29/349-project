When you point towards a wall with you'r cursor and click the left mouse button, you change the characters own personal gravity and make that wall into an floor.\n\nUsing this one mechanic you must navigate through these levels while trying to figure out the right course of actions on how to get through them.\nAt the start it's just changing the gravity to the roof to avoid an obstacle, but rather quickly the game's difficulty starts to spike up as it brings elements into the levels that affect you and the level itself in number of ways.\nLike moving deathrays and such that you must avoid (hence the name deathray), surfaces that do not allow the change of gravity and walls that let you through only if you are on particular gravity level/plain/field?\n\nThere is also a story in the game which is at least intriguing if nothing else. Mostly a female voice narrates about something that has happened to her or perhaps to the player itself, not really clear as of yet to me.\nThe voice also changes it's tone depending on the stage where you are at.\nThe stages are separeted into themes following the 5 stages of loss and grief.\nIn the denial stages the narrator is indeed very much so in denial and as you advance to anger she gets really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of at everything.\n\nThe visuals also reflect the emotional stages very well and help you to set yourself into that particular mood.\n\nThe music fits and there's nothing else really about it to say except that it has the same effect with you're movement speed like in Portal. That was cool.\n\nYou'll get some replay value from this by trying to beat you'r previous time records and trying to find all the secrets of the game which give you some more tiny story bits.\n\nAll and all a good puzzle platformer, but I'd still prefer portal with its humor, then this psychoanalysis of humans but its still interesting.\n\nDo check my video out if you are on the fence about you're possible  purchase or just watch it anyway.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/toY0IBescCI\n","March 5, 2015","true","2.4"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","21","27","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/losthopefate/recommended/322550/","losthopefate","LostHopeFate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/losthopefate/","304 products in account","Standpoint is a first-person puzzle game that allows you to manipulate gravity and the world's orientation to overcome obstacles.\n\nI currently have around 26 hours in the game and it's easily one of the best puzzle games I've played this year. It's simple to pick up but deceptively challenging. The game has around 20 chapters that mix up the mechanics as you progress. The more you play, the more you learn how to manipulate the world effectively. It can get pretty difficult as you move further in to the game but nothing too crazy as StandPoint does a good job of preparing you for the later levels.\n\nStandPoint's puzzles offer a good balance of reflex based solutions and thinking solutions. The chapters offer enough variety to keep you interested to the end and despite getting frustrated at times trying to figure out a solution, actually realizing what the solution was and executing it became really rewarding.\n\nI'd say my favourite parts of the game were the hidden "secrets" as they offered a completely new challenge to the game and required a lot of creative thinking to find and aquire them. These secrets along with time trials and challenging achievements definitely give you your money's worth and make this game a sure recommendation.\n\nI'd pick up this game for sure if you like games like Antichamber, Relativity and Portal (obviously) as StandPoint offers something unique and interesting enough to keep you playing until the end. The dev is a cool guy and listens to all player feedback and fixes any bugs in a timely manner too. StandPoint is a great puzzler that offers interesting mechanics with a supported underlying narrative that brings it all together.","May 28, 2015","true","28.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Not sure I'll continue playing, it's really not enjoyable for me, and if I want a philosophical meander, there are already enough First-Person walking sims and adventure games out there that make you ate least feel like a human, not just some thing in a maze.\n\nNothing overcome.","January 21","false","0.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

The basic puzzle solving mechanics are easy to learn but finding the right path isnt always easy and can take some skill with timings and air control(if you've spent any time surfing or playing those kind of skill maps on the source engine you'll feel right at home with this game)\n\nThe narration was a bit of a drag but thankfully there's an option to disable it in the audio menu, so can't really fault it there.\n\nWorth the price =)","March 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Looking at how to face grief in a moving and interesting way. Like dealing with grief this game allows you to face each challenge in your own time all the while making the journey more difficult as you deal with the stages of grief. If you are looking for something different,  refreshing and brilliant the this game is for you. It even allows for speed running due to it recording your times from start to finish.  I strongly recommend you get this game.","March 9, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's something different than all other games that are realised. I didn't play lot yet, but even first stages are hard to make it sometimes. This game compare together arcade, some action, lots of puzzle and fun. It shows that there is no need to make all those graphic detail to make game look preatty.\n\nfor me, there is only 2 things missing\n\n- Workshop, and built in tool to make comunity levels\n- Some storyline, but i am on begining, mabe i just didnt got it yet.\n\nbut to finish. I am personaly not a big fan of puzzle games but shooters, but this game is one of games i love right now, very cool, and it give me some satisfaction when i pass levels, like in portal but in a bit different way. i give 9/10 right now, becouse music and voices are also very good and climatic.","March 20, 2015","true","0.5"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

While the navigation of the death tunnels does require new insights and different ways of looking at things, the amount of agility required to execute the changes of perspective in a small amount of time may frustrate those who aren't veterans of the platforming genre. Then the level names start to sound all too apt: Denial, Anger, etc.\n\nThe progression of the game covers the five stages of grief, and you learn more about the narrator's tragedy by finding secret alcoves. The theme seems appropriate, as it requires a massive change of perspective to move on from loss. I will admit, though, that at times the journey seemed endless, and I wished each level were 25% shorter.\n\nGamers experienced in platformers may enjoy the interesting way that you rotate the world around you  by changing your Down. Previous ways of doing things are no longer possible. To advance, you must find a new StandPoint.","January 11","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
