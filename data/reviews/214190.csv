The crafting is more like how Terraria does it, you collect materials and choose something to craft, you won't be forced to lay out your resources on a 3x3 crafting grid during combat :P\n\nThe graphics are awesome too, what is lost in texture quality is more than made up for in particle effects with explosive plasma grenades, explosive sniper rounds, explosive explosives, and glowing swords.\nYou read this right, swords.\nGlowing, particle trail active, slashy swords.\nWhich give you superpowers.\nThen again, so do most of the weapons.\nJumping, dashing, vision enhancement, telekinesis, (you can redirect projectiles) the list goes on!\n\nWords cannot do this game justice, and just by signing up you can get cool exclusive armour, too :P\nShameless referral link, please click me[playminimum.com]\nAaaand if you purcahse and play while the game is in Early Access, you get an exclusive reskin of the Inferno Katanas to play with :D\n\nTL;DR\nQuake + Unreal Tournament + Warframe + Dota + Terraria + Michael Bay\nANGRY TITANS\nKillstreaks\nLots of weapons, lots of armour\nSuperpowers\nBuy now get extra swords\nGo play it now.","May 9, 2014","true","118.2"," 538 of 671 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","538","671","0","7"

So take some of my comments on tactics or ways to play, coming from bringing old game knowledge into a new game with old gameplay style.\n\nTL:DR If you don't like fast paced, twitch based combat, with no bullet drop, no lead time, and point and click weapons ALA unreal, or OG CS. you'll hate this game, because it will punish you for being a bad player. if you like those things and have always been good at them, enjoy your 23/0  score (hint: BH+SSG+Grenade = gg). The game is not completely finished! but has really tight controls and movement, feels like a solid game, and has lots of potential! Support these guys, they have created a really great hybrid. Thanks alot devs :)\n\n\nFirst off this game is SOOOO much fun! IF! you like twitch based shooters and MOBA esque gameplay smooshed together with a fun simplistic blocky style to it that keeps your attention focused on the action.  <---- If that turns you off, DON'T BUY IT!\n\nYou don't need to aim ahead, there is no bullet drop, quick scoping is a thing, and if your a high speed mofo, who used to love playing insta gib on unreal, playing snipers in this game will be cake, and will net you ALOT of profit.\n\nMAJOR DISCLAIMER: This game is JUST barely out of early access, it's basically a beta right now. Meaning, there are alot of coming soon, and not implemented yet, for different upgrades and such on weapons and armors and what not. It literally says the build is like 0.5#### right now.\n\nthat being said IMHO it is totally worth 5 dollars, hell i would pay ten (provided i have the information i have now after playing it).\n\nGameplay and Asethetics: The graphics are simple, yet convey quite well what's going on, with the glow of weapons giving off an idea of your opponents weapon levels, and armor being able to usually distinguish what someone is wearing, if your willing to get that close. The ability to mix and match armor sets, as well as choose your own loadouts is very satisfying, as you get to compliment your weapon build with your armor build, getting things like +20% or +15% damage. You get to earn resources and craft your gear from blue prints. The progression is very satisfying.\n\nTitan Mode: It starts, you have enough resource to craft one piece of armor, of three that you can wear. Helmet, Chestpiece, Leggings. You have your two weapons, and a extra item, grenade or mini gun turret.\nSo you immiedieatly go out to find your opponents and shoot/stab them to death. Did i mention their is melee!? So much fun.\nYour titans have also spawned and are marching to meet in the middle of the map, you want to go put as much damage on your opponents titan as possible as an early pressure can really hurt them if they are not paying attention. Usually though, if both teams are somewhat competent or decent, or just paying attention. Both titans die quite quickly, then it goes into creep farming phase. In this phase, you want to kill the wee little creeps for crystals (which add +1 to your titans strength) and give you resources to upgrade your armors! (+20% health? yes pelase! 15% MOAR damage?! yes please!). Keep an eye out for the GOLDEN CREEP! when it dies and drops it's ONE golden resource the team to secure this immiedieatly gets +10 strength to their titan. When the timer ends for this phase, then it's back to tians smashing eachother and your (or hopefully the enemy teams) walls and eventually base. That is the game currently.\n\nCurrent Game Balance IMHO: The overall balance is solid, with only a few weapons seeming kind of meh, and everything else feeling strong to use. The two main starter weapons are easily the strongest in the game sans snipers. but that depends on your skill level. Melee is strong, but low skill entry low ceiling, easy to kite.","September 13, 2014","true","17.1"," 442 of 572 people (77%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","77","442","572","22","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigstraw/recommended/214190/","Jigstraw","Jigstraw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jigstraw/","175 products in account","Even having only played for a few hours, I can already tell this game has some serious issues that need to be fixed before I'd consider recommending it to anyone. Yes, it's a fun and unique experience, and I hope these flaws are addressed,  but some of the mechanics, while well-implemented, just aren't good mechanics to have. They sound great on paper, but are terrible when put into practice.\n\nI'm speaking of course, of the weapon power up system. When you get a kill, the victim drops a resource that "levels up" your weapon, granting it extra abilities, damage, fire rate, etc. Okay, not that bad, rewarding the player for getting kills. Except these powerups are lost in full as soon as you die, putting you at a massive disadvantage when you respawn. Not only does it reward the player who got the kill beyond the reward of the kill itself, but it punishes the player who got killed beyond the punishment of having died. All it really serves as is a massive snowball effect. The more kills you get, the easier it is to get more. This also applies to the rest of your team. If you're doing well, you'll quickly max out your weapon level, leaving the rest of the power boost resources on the ground for your team-mates. The game becomes easier as you progress not only because you do more damage, but because the enemy player has lost all of their weapon's progress, meaning they can't out-damage you, and the only chance they have of making a comeback relies on you and/or your team making a mistake. Also, it influences what weapons are viable, as you have to actually move to where the victim died to pick up the resource that powers your weapon, meaning sniping is an inferior playstyle that provides no reward. Why even have a sniper if using it is more punishing than rewarding? Not only do you not get a boost to the weapon by using it as intended, but the resource is left on the ground in the open, where anyone could pick it up, whether they're on your team or not. So in sniping, you risk rewarding the other team more than yourself.\n\nFurthermore, most of the Death Match maps I've seen have all lended themselves almost exclusively to close range combat. Cover is abundant, making mid and long range combat a frustrating game of peek-a-boo, as all of the weapons suited to mid-long range combat have such long kill times, the player can simply duck around a corner before you have a chance to inflict a lethal amount of damage, recover their health, and come back, inevitably rushing you and making the  fight a close range encounter. Also, the melee weapons are all absurdly broken, as they're equally as powerful and even stronger in some cases than the projectile weapons, take less skill to use, and are more rewarding, as close range fights make powering up your weapon even easier. That leads to a majority of the players in a match, outside of the bots that fill the empty slots in the teams, using melee weapons as a primary, making the projectile weapons seem like a mere afterthought. There shouldn't be a clearly better option in a game centered around balance and variety. And in my opinion,  weapon's damage output should scale with their difficulty to use, which I don't think is reflected in the game's aresenal of weapons.\n\nMoving on from that, a lot of the game feels very unpolished. When moving around, I've gotten stuck clipping on obstacles that should have easily been walked or jumped over, gotten stuck in walls, titans, and machine turrets, and even just gotten stuck on oddly shaped geometry due to what seems like bad collision detection.\n\nAlso, in pretty much every game mode, be prepared to have your shots completely blocked by team-mates getting between you and your target. I don't think team-killing is possible, but I've gotten killed plenty of times due to a team-mate blocking my shot on an enemy, then dying while reloading after wasting half a clip into the back of their head.\n\nThe game's Titan mode is fun and interesting, but isn't very well explained. I had to figure out the objectives, as well as how to achieve them, through trial and error. The tutorial tells you what to do, but it doesn't tell you WHY you should be doing it. And I didn 't even get to watch most of the tutorial, because I opened a menu in the middle of it, which was impossible to close once it had been opened, and obstructed almost the entire screen, including the "hint" text fields that are meant to provide information about the game. In addition to the lack of in-depth explanation, there are fixed spawn zones in Titan mode that can be outright camped by one or two enemy players, making it impossible for you or your team to collect resources to power your titan, destroy the enemy titan, or  defend your own from enemy fire.\n\nThere's also no visible health indicator in your in-game HUD (I eventually figured out that the more damage you've taken, the brighter your character glows orange, but the game never told me that I should be watching for that) as well as various UI problems, like the in-game scoreboard rarely shows an accurate readout of the match, instead displaying only your own stats, and the stats of the best player from either team, leaving your team-mates readout with a bunch of zeroes,  spite the actual score indicating otherwise. (This has been my experience with it at least. I tend to open the scoreboard whenever I die to keep tabs on the match, and I've seen an accurate, completely filled scoreboard like twice out of more than two dozen games. )\n\nOn top of all of this, every time I close the game, it hard-locks and can't be closed without hitting ALT+Ctrl+Del, opening the task manager, typing the name of the program (Because the blank game window stays on top of every other program you're running, making it impossible to see what you're doing) and hit delete to force close it.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is not bad by any stretch, and has a lot of potential to be incredibly good, in fact. It just needs to have a lot of these glaring flaws smoothed out before that can happen. If you're an optimist, and like the idea of what this game COULD be, then by all means, purchase it. If you're just going to casually play for fun, and not care about whether it's fair or balanced, go ahead. But if you're a competitive player that wants a tactical team-based shooter, don't bother. 90% of the players I've seen use swords, as they require the least skill and provide the most reward. The developers may as well just make a swordfight game mode, then maybe the sword kids wouldn't be such a plague in the deathmatch mode.\n\nIf these changes are addressed in future updates, I'll gladly change my review to be more supportive of the game, as I like the idea of a shooter/MOBA crossover and would like to see it succeed.","January 28, 2015","false","17.8"," 266 of 353 people (75%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","75","266","353","11","14"

It grabbed me and put two blue flaming katanas in my hand and said "See that big ♥♥♥ giant robot right there? yeah, go get 'em tiger!"\n\nI've only played a bit of this, and I gotta say it's one of the more fun Third person shooters out there, all three game modes are pretty damn fun, and the crafting system isn't TOO overboard when it comes to materials needed. Just in the first 30 minutes alone I was able to make my first guns.\n\nThe fact that guns level up as you get kills is really awesome too, it has sort of a gun game feel to it, except you don't feel like you're dreading the next level in gun. Like really, the feeling of upgrading suddenly from one katana to TWO KATANAS is awesome, and slicing people up is just as awesome.\nThe visuals, surprisingly are not as simple as they may seem, everything has a really nice solid feel to it and the atomsphere is still incredibly nice feeling, it's like you take Gears of War and you strip it down to it's base, and stylize that a bunch. I really do love it.\n\nIf you're looking for a game to waste 1-3 hours a day on with friends, or even just need something fresh, definitely pick up this game, it's cheap, it's fun, and it's got lots of charm to it.","September 11, 2014","true","3.8"," 154 of 220 people (70%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","70","154","220","16","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/harharinfigar/recommended/214190/","harharinfigar","PWNomancer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/harharinfigar/","105 products in account","So I bought this game on sale, and it looked really good, but I couldnt play it because my com♥♥♥♥r was a ♥♥♥♥, but now, on my new com♥♥♥♥r, It works fine. This game is really fun, Like, REALLY FUN. I'd say that it's a lot more fun than even Space marine was for me, and as an avid fan of warhammer 40k, That means something.\n\nThere are a few balance issues though. For starters, jumping backwards is the same speed as running forwards, so you know, Melee is really easy to counter. Speaking of that, Almost everything you come across is a counter for melee.\nShotguns, Miniguns, Sniper rifles, Launchers, EVEN SOME GRENADES WHIPE THE FLOOR WITH YOU. Now, I'm not saying melee is impossible, quite the opposite, It's really fun. Personally i'm a fan of the Heal katana, but i dont see it often. It's just kind of annoying when you get someone with a freeze gun so that you cant move, a fire grenade so you cant heal, and a shotgun to sit right infront of you, but just out of range. Speaking of that, I cant figure out which one, But one of the shotguns seems really freaking broken. In three games, this same guy was wielding it, and it ended up deciding the fate of all three games. I mean what the ♥♥♥♥? It has a set spread and high damage and fire rate. Who thought that was a good idea? It doesnt even have a slow reload speed or anything. Once it starts rolling, it doesnt stop, unless you snipe him down, which you cant do because there's freaking terrain literally everywhere.\n\nOther than that, the gameplay really is quite fun. The main gamemode is titan mode, where, when the game starts, you have enough for one peice of armor, and both teams have a titan. Both titans are invulnerable untill they start to fight.\nPretty much at this point you have two choices, Help destroy theirs, or use excessive force to stop them from destroying yours. After either dies, the other goes on to try break two walls, There are turrets that assist you at this point, but the enemies can destroy those. After either has destroyed both walls, they have to break the enemies power core with four hits. When both die, a new phase begins called the creep round, in which you go around killing some creeps for recources for armor and to power up your titan. There are also golden ones, which are really fast and hard to kill with melee (Rip), Which, as you can guess, gives better recourses and boosts your titan even more. As you kill enemies, your currently equipped weapon levels up up to 5 times. When you die, it resets. I'm not sure how the reset is calculated, but i often end up with level 2-3 out of spawning, which is wierd. So armor has three levels and doesnt reset. Armor has really nice bonuses, For instance, i use a centurian armor set, which gives bonuses to yourself and nearby teammates, like movementspeed damage and healing bonuses. it also raises your health by a bunch. All in all, I reccomend this game. it's really fun, but not without it's kinks. I'd say about a 7.5/10.","March 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 45 of 58 people (78%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","78","45","58","5","9"

It's every bit worth it. Just thought I'd put this out there for those considering.\n\nNow, I've seen a couple bugs. If you're pressing/holding a directional key when a match is starting, your character can sometimes get stuck moving in that direction. I'm talking about with the keyboard here, so I imagine the same issue might be present on a controller (a positive that it's so easy to set one up if you wish).\n\nThe only other problem I've seen is a number of one-sided matches, whether I'm on the winning side or not. This can almost entirely be attributed to how new the game is, however. Everybody will figure it out given some time. FYI the ability to run and gun outweighs the benefits of swords at least in the early/mid game.\n\nDespite minor stuff as above, this game feels like a good shooter, and it feels like a very polished game considering how small the dev team must be. It's graphics are simplistic (or minimalistic, as the title plays on), but still very pleasant to look at, especially when maxed out.\n\nThere's plenty of depth and longevity to the crafting system and progressive power curve in each match. When it comes right down to it, what any MOBA or MOBA-lite needs is solid combat, and this game delivers.\n\nGIGANTIC looks like a great game as well, but to some extent, it feels like Minimum has already accomplished what that game intends to do.\n\nGreat job devs. Anxiously awaiting future updates as this game hopefully continues to grow.","September 13, 2014","true","6.1"," 80 of 119 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","80","119","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wiegraf/recommended/214190/","wiegraf","Wiegraf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wiegraf/","638 products in account","Minimum in its concept is an interesting idea : a third person shooter where, during the match, you weapons evolve as you eliminate AI enemies and enemy players while protecting your own Titan and trying to bring down theirs so that you can smash into their base.\n\nSounds familiar? It is actually as it's a pretty good attempt at mixing the intensity of a shooter with the non-permanent progression found in MOBAs with a few key differences which I'll cover a bit later. It's a game about mobility since you have a melee weapon component which also evolves and armor you can craft that grants benefits while taking away from you at the same time (Want more melee protection? You become more vulnerable to firearm damage, etc.). This makes it so classes are dynamic in that you can mix and match armor parts so you can create a set that fits your playstyle or the current situation in the match.\n\nWeapons usually evolves in 5 tiers, with the lowest tier being your 'basic ' weapon which usually does a pitiful amount of damage. With every player kill, your weapon changes forms and gains new attributes (higher fire rate, more projectiles, additionnal effects, etc.) which makes it perform better. Same with melee weapon, they grow larger, swing faster, are set on fire. Every time you get killed, that progression is lost and you are reset to the weapon's most basic form.\n\nAnd here lies one of the glaring flaw in the game : momentum. A match's outcome is usually decided in the very first minute due to this system as the first team to have a player to do reasonably well will gain weapons that will make matching up to him nigh impossible. Once that player has a foothold, he can usually blast or hack away any enemy without difficulty and, by doing so, ready his armor faster than any other.\n\n"Well, that's what happens in MOBA, right? You level up, gain better gear, kill more." Yes, except that in MOBAs, you aren't reset to level 1 each time you are killed. Add to that weapon balance which favors either very close range combat or extreme long range and weapons like an assault rifle becomes near useless in favor of people constantly running a shotgun, blades or a sniper rifle with the odd few which end up with launchers that will make any semblance of fair play tossed out of the window. A shotgun or blade user will rush you and can blast or cut you to pieces well before an assault rifle will deal enough damage to take them down and a sniper will likely one-shot you from range while your shots spread all over the place.\n\n"But, your armor stays even when you die." It does, but like stated, it gives and takes at the same time; it only helps your playstyle, doesn't directly make you stronger whereas the weapons themselves are the factors that grants a direct power boost. If your armor does, for example, 40 damage and you are given a 15% boost due to armor, the guy which has the tier 5 variant of the same weapon which does 60 damage will still outclass you.\n\nDon't get me wrong; this might actually appeal to people in that they find players who have tier 5 weapons during a match challenging to fight but the problem lies in that this becomes not a contest of skill past that minute but a constant David versus Goliath scenario where David gets constantly stomped unless Goliath flukes.\n\nLevel design-wise, the environnement are quite nicely presented, following the advertised style of having minimal detail. In fact, the style itself is perhaps one of the best point of the game as this simplistic approach makes level interestingly colorful and almost gives the impression of playing in different sport arenas, each with their own theme. This also means the landscape is clear cut and overall easy to navigate while still having enough Z-axis combat for variety.\n\nAnother downside is that despite its simplistic looks, the game tend to require rather capable hardware to run. Though it's possible to lessen the load by disabling a few graphic options, it feels at this point that the game might lack a bit on the optimisation side of things. It's surprising how even with an apparent low polycount for the environnement, the game seems to struggle that much to maintain a decent framerate.\n\nNevertheless, weighting both the pros and cons, I can't recommend this game unless you don't mind the inherent problem of momentum in the game; if that's the case, you might enjoy Minimum but otherwise, you'll find the experience to be frustatingly unfair due to the mechanical gaps created by the evolving weapons.","September 10, 2014","false","0.4"," 662 of 1,114 people (59%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","59","662","1","13","60"

However this game is still being built, THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE FIXED. There's also a lot of cool features that we don't have access to yet, with the promise of "Coming Soon" (such as being able to level up your gun) Even with the bare game I still love the look and the play of the game. For some reason I like the simplicity of shape based maps and players! (it still looks awesome and I feel it's easier to run on my rig)\n\nThe game modes are really cool (Team Deathmatch, Titan, and Horde, a survival Co-op type game mode against enemies/dinos) My favorite being "Titan" where you must get your Titan to the other side of the map whilist enemies trying to stop yours and progress theirs. If the Titans are destroyed you must battle it out for materials which come from "Crystal Spiders" or "Creeps" a bug like creature that just runs around spawn areas, in order to get your titan up and moving again. There's also a golden creep that gives your titan 10 points of power. The power is how strong your titan hits the other? or how much damage it can take? All I know is that the more points that your titan has, the better. The gamemode's very fast paced and the matches last a fairly long time if the teams are even, around 30 mins max. Even though the match lasts so long, I never find myself getting board due to the amount of things/objectives to focus on during the match. If everything is pulled off correctly your team will achieve victory through your titan smashing the enemie's core crystal.\n\nThe weapons are amazing, you can either run around like a ninja or rain down on enemies with your machine gun. Other weapons include, snipers, mini guns, machine guns, shotguns, light sabers, and much more crazy stuff to come. However if you want some extra awesome stuff you've gotta pay for it, and it's quite expensive. You can buy either cool special looking weapons or armour each with their own interesting effects and attributes (for example, a green light saber with the ablility to heal yourself and others around you).\n\nI feel they need to balance the sword more though because of how fast people can get near you and slice you in half(There are amours and Techniques to contradict this!) Each time you get a kill you can pick up a crystal that will upgrade your weapon (you can also get these crystals from friendly/enemies destroyed sentrys) and if you get more than a few crystals then you're maxed out and it makes your gun freaking godlike. It makes other players have to team up against you in order to kill you which is a cool addition to teamwork within gamemodes. Aside from working with your team to get rid of pesky enemies, you can run and jump quite smoothly in game allowing you to avoid gun fire and secure the kill. Last but not least I'd like to say a tad about armour and equipment. Armour can be bought throught the match with materials collected, different armour gives you different abilitys and new armour can be bought with points from playing matches. You may upgrade each peice of armour the same as weapons except armour upgrades don't go away when you die and you may only upgrade armour 3 times to max them out. Equipment can also help a bunch wheather it be a well placed gernade or sentry. You may unlock more equipment simply by unlocking and crafting with aquired points from matches.\n\nI've had a decent amount of server difficulties. Sometimes I'll play a whole match and get a good amount of kills and then at the end it'll say "You've been disconnected" or something as the match score board is up which is really frustrating to a guy that likes to stack up his kills and wins. It'll also kick me sometimes at random times in the match saying "Lost connection to host". Another bummer is that I don't get any xp when this happens so no leveling up.... I don't know if this is happening to anyone else though. It hasn't happened to me to many times but due to the fact that it has happened leaves me cringing towards the end of each match.\n\nI think that anyone whos got a few bucks should try this game out either now while you've got it half off, or later when there's more features and updates to play off of!\n\nI really enjoy this game. It seems like so far you're either going to fall in love with it or completely hate every thing about it. Might aswell give it a try while it's on sale.","September 12, 2014","true","10.0"," 92 of 144 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","92","144","0","1"

The game is VERY highly unbalanced, which normally, wouldn"t be a problem. However, Minimum takes the issue so much farther than it needs to go. The swords (every single one of them) will take a maximum of 3 hits to kill. Combine that with the Knight Armor which increases health by a mind boggling amount, and you're unstoppable. The game itself is fun if you can find a group who are around your level. I don't leave the game a thumbs down because of unbalancing though. My issue with the game at the moment is the way it works. During the tutorial, it says you're invincible during spawn. Nope. Players will idle in your spawn (which there is no penalty for) and spawn kill you with the 1 hit kill level 5 plasma cannon, over and over again. If they're not spawn killing, they're glitching, boosting, or lagging. This game struck me as a masterpiece during development (the earlier stages) but now it is so loaded with trash talking 12 year olds and spawn killing scrubs with +200% health and a 1 shot weapon, that it is unplayable. Wait until full release before you purchase, this game is just not good in its current form.","May 21, 2014","false","2.9"," 62 of 94 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","62","94","0","0"

Minimum on the other hand has changed me from a Steam plebeian into a Steam reviewing sensei.\n\nGame just left early access and still has more content than COD.\nUpdated: 4/9/15\n\nI haven't had this much fun with a multiplayer shooter since Badcompany 2. I was real skeptical at first with it just leaving early access. I've had my share of disappointments with early access games and betas on Steam (shakes fist at Starbound) But I'm glad I made that leap head first into Minimum.\n\nTitan Mode: I get most of my enjoyment from this mode. The smaller maps never leave you with a dull match. This mode is heavily team based, if you're 10x better than the other team but don't work together to kill creeps you're going to have a bad time.\n\nHorde mode:  It's come a long way and is a lot of fun. Not a whole lot of people play is sadly, probably because you can spend 40+ mins playing and the amount of currency squares you gain are minimum. "10/10 pun" but seriously one 13min game of Titan Mode will net you more than a 40min Horde Mode game.\n\nThe crafting system is pretty fun, not too in depth but fun non the least. Each match you start off with enough to make one piece of armor and from there kill creeps and players to build more. Each piece has its own unique set of traits and leveling your armor up is pretty crucial to winning.There are armor pieces you can buy with real money but are just cosmetic and are in no way a (pay to win) cash grab.\n\nAll in all for $9.99 this is a great 3rd person shooter with unique gameplay you wont find anywhere else.","September 15, 2014","true","17.1"," 51 of 78 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","51","78","3","3"

The menu shows it as 0.0.5-something, in fact.\n\nMany of the menu options are greyed out, and the tutorials take the time to explain how this is because those features aren't done yet. For example, there's a "schematic" system that has you crafting items mid-match, and it talks about building structures and deployables, but the only thing that you can create is armor. Deployables and structures aren't done yet, apparently.\n\nAs if that weren't bad enough, the "titan" mode that the game sells itself on is nothing like what they'd have you believe that it is. My impression, from watching the videos, reading the store page, and looking at screenshots, was that it was somewhat Monday Night Combat-like, with both sides having creeps fighting alongside them, and players defeating the creeps as well as enemy players to power up both themselves and their team's titan, with the objective of ultimately pushing their titan into the enemy's base to win.\n\nThis is not the case.\n\nInstead, it's team deathmatch, even down to the small, cramped maps, where little dispensers along the sides spit out "creeps," tiny cube-shaped robots that do absolutely nothing but arbitrarily wander around. These spawn whenever titans are inactive, and you kill them for "titan powerups" to improve your titan, which is never quite explained in any depth. "It makes it stronger," is about as detailed a description as you'll get. Once you collect enough, the titans spawn, and meet in the middle of the map to fight. The winner keeps moving and tries to break walls down until it is destroyed. This goes on, ad infinitum, until both walls on one side are destroyed, or you get frustrated and quit because the match has been going on for half an hour.\n\nPossibly the most egregious offense, however, was having to create an account and log into a third party service upon starting the game, and then to be greeted with a cash shop on the main menu.\n\nAlso worth noting is that the game is extremely unstable. Matchmaking frequently does not work, inviting friends to parties can return a number of bizarre and unclear error messages, or leave you in an empty party that doesn't even display yourself as a member, and having the Steam overlay open (especially during loading screens) can cause crashes to desktop and graphical artifacts. Often these errors can only be resolved by completely exiting the game and restarting it. Even the tutorial glitches out if you try to use the menu, forcing you to quit the game rather than being able to return to the tutorial or do anything else.\n\nCurrently there are very few maps, even fewer weapons, and tremendous balance issues, which I won't even go into, as they're covered extensively by the other Steam reviews. I would really not recommend purchasing this.","September 11, 2014","false","1.1"," 335 of 580 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","335","580","3","16"

And to be honest, my opinion still stands.\n\nAt this point? Save your money. Trust me. - My inital thought.\n\nWhen I wrote this down and made it public for you to see, this was during the Second Beta Weekend that they had where people could get a code and activate it on steam, and I obviously took part in this.\n\nWhen I first played Minimum, I instantly liked the visuals that they had to offer. The simplistic design is something you will either love or hate. I personally love them, but with the lack of detail it would be understanding why you would not like the visuals.\n\nNow when I first started to play Minimum, I did not know what to think. The game just throws you in without no explanation what so ever, which could be a problem for many new players coming into the game. Without you looking up or knowing ahead of time you would have no clue on what the armor does, or may not even know that it exists! A huge downfall.\n\nBalancing is also a major problem. As you get kills with your chosen weapon, they level up becoming more powerful and more unique. The problem with this is that one or two people on the enemy team can kill you in one shot while you try to kill them with a whole clip. A huge problem.\n\nAt this point, there is only one game mode, that being Titan. Titan being a Team DeathMatch which has an emphasis on killing an enemy titan to get your titan to move up and destroy There titan factory. (Or whatever its called.) You can also power up your titan by killing creep which spawn when both titans are destroyed, adding a MOBA element to a 3rd person shooter, which is quite unique in itself. But that being the only game mode, it can get quite boring really fast.\n\nAt this point, I still say do not buy this game unless you like the concept. However, I would still say that you wait for new game modes, new guns and new blueprints to be added to the game.","May 13, 2014","false","6.4"," 88 of 146 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","88","146","0","14"

It was progressing steadily enough but then the servers went down indefinitely and the entire community was left with a bad taste in their mouth. Come 2016 however, we had news of a revival and in the last month or two the servers have come back up and there are improved features.\n\nGameplayMinimum thrives off high-intensity, action-packed and extremely competitive combat. Whether you choose deathmatch or titan mode, you're sure to have a blast. One thing that makes Minimum stand out from the crowd, is its unique weapon-evolving system. When someone dies, they drop some fragments. Picking those up will automatically add it to your weapon, granting it a more upgraded form and more damage. This is one of the most fun aspects of the game, as you're essentially competing against other players in an effort to not only collect those upgrades, but keep them, because dying will cause you to lose all your weapon upgrades. But that's not all.\n\nMinimum also has a similar armor upgrading system. You have three parts of armor which you can upgrade in a match. Each armor section has different benefits, and once you lock into an armor path, you can't switch it again. For example, if you choose the berzerker chestpiece, you have to continue to upgrade that specific item, and you can't swap it out. However armor pieces can be mixed and matched, so that you can have different chestpieces, boots and helmets. Dying does not cause you to lose these upgrades, so even if the enemy team is somewhat 'stomping', you have an opportunity to shut them down, and beat them with the right upgrades. Each weapon and armor piece has different attributes and abilities, so there's a ton of fun to be had here.\n\nTitan Mode\nTitan Mode is one of the most fun modes I've played in any game ever. Essentially, each team is fighting to get their titan to the opposite team's base. There are a lot of things to empower titans, and seeing the massive struggle happen literally next to you is awe-inspiring and just plain awesome.\n\nCrafting\nThere is a pretty fun crafting system in place, allowing you to create or upgrade existing weapons, items and extras to be assigned to loadout slots. Weapons have a variety of effects and abilities so go wild and explore all that Minimum has to offer.\n\nVisualsThis game, is drop-dead gorgeous. It's like Minecraft or Trove, but without any of the crafting, and with highly detailed objects, environments and items. At maxed settings, the game's environments are sure to leave an impression on your mind, and yet the game is fairly well optimized to run on lower end pc's. The art style seems to be mostly futuristic and it really does this well.\n\nAudioThe futuristic theme does not stop in the graphics department. In fact, the audio is even more so futuristic at times. Sounds in every part of the game are done very well, and combine with the already beautiful environments and interface for one pleasant package. Music is pretty entertaining, though there isn't much on the side of voice-overs; not that this game needs that necessarily.\n\nOther ThoughtsThere have been complaints about balancing items/weapons as well as the cash shop. This is one aspect of the game that I'm watching tentatively to see whether it will be addressed. At the moment, the game feels overall fun and fair in a deathmatch type-environment, but whether some items may be overpowered in a more confined, team-based setting is yet to be seen.\n\nOne thing is for sure, the current developers are actually working to get this game where it needs to be. Right now, I'm just happy to be able to experience the Titan mode once again, as well as the evolving crafting system. I believe Minimum is one of the first modern games to do this right.\n\nA server browser has been added which is a breath of fresh air into the game, allowing people to actually join games on demand rather than wait for matchmaking.\n\nSummaryI never thought this game would return, yet it did, and for what this game offers I'm glad it did. Minimum offers a fun, third-person shooter combined with a very unique upgrade system which makes each match just a little more different than the previous. It remains to be seen how much better this game can get, but the devs have already proven that they are willing to keep their promises, so for that I am willing to believe in Minimum again.\n\n9/10 - Don't play with my heart again devs\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

That's the overwhelming feeling that I'm getting with this. Why did it leave Early Access when the game clearly suffers from serious issues, both optimization and balancing wise?\n\nLet's start with the optimization. I don't know why, but the main menu with the announcements gets very laggy, while the other options that seemingly show more of the 3D world give me a smooth framerate. Which wouldn't be as annoying, if it wasn't the page that everything defaulted to. Especially when changing servers, you'll just get punted back to that laggy main menu. Which, by the way, lags everything else as well. Don't try and pick another server in Steam Overlay when that's going on.\n\nAnd then there's Titan mode. A mode with obvious influences, not in the least with Moba influences where there are creeps to farm that power up your Titan. For people who start out, it can actually get very fun. Everyone's new and barely knows what to do, which means it usually turns into a straight up bout between forces.\n\nBut as I level, I seem to encounter more higher levelled people. And they seem to be wielding a nasty little baseraping tactic. One or two of them with maximum levelled weaponry, shells down the opposing team's spawn point while the others farm the Creeps, attack your Titan or escort their own.\n\nBut you may say, aren't there safezones that we spawn in? Yes, but more often than not, the baseraping happens just outside of there, at points where the team stil gets funneled. Whether or not they're doing it in sight of the Spawn cubicles is irrelevant, really. Even if you try to snipe them, your unlevelled weapon (your weapons delevel upon death) can't hit them hard enough before they can retreat just a little bit and continue what they are doing.\nIn short words: Baseraping is the name of the game, and if you're on the receiving end, prepare to get frustrated.\n\nHorde Mode seems fine, but the difficulty ramps up rediculously fast from wave 4 on. Enemies taking shots from the strongest of weapons straight to the face and still perfectly surviving. That's getting a little rediculous. And with a recent patch that apparently nerfs the rewards for these, I'm not sure I want to play these anymore either.\n\nWhich leaves Team Deathmatch. It's actually one of the better modes to start playing, and seems exploited the least. When more than three combatants meet, it all tends to get pretty chaotic and it seems moderately fun.\n\nBut even that gets soured when you realize that staying in a server is 9 out of 10 times absolutely not a good idea. A bunch of people leave the server as soon as a match is over, and you're stuck for a long while waiting on random people's mercy to join your game. Games will not start until most or all slots are filled (I've yet to actually see a game start where the final holes didn't get filled) I myself got so sick of it, I too started server hopping soon enough. It's the only way to consistently play and also get some rewards.\n\nBut if these holes don't get filled during a match... well, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck then. You can really feel it what team gets the advantage when someone disconnects and nobody fills the gap. In fact, I left a match for that reason, accidentally came back later and saw that autobalance was not a thing. Indeed, 3 v 5 is something that does not get resolved during a match.\n\nRewards are always three types of resources, used to craf weaponry or pay to make specific sets of armor available. Functionality wise, they seem fine, but the menu interface of them isn't optimal either. I was clicking on a weapons picture  (not the equip button) and was hoping to receive some interesting information regarding the weapon in question. Not so, most of the time. A semi blank and obviously unfinished window greets me. If I actually want to learn more about a weapon, I need to go to the crafting menu for it and spot it there.\n\nSome hard statistics would be nice, too. What's the rate of fire? How many bullets are there in a clip? Information like that can only be learned by crafting the weapon and taking it for a spin. Yes, that does mean you end up risking creating a weapon you may end up disliking solely because you weren't properly informed.\n\nThese are all complaints that would possibly get a pass or can be ignored if it was in Beta or "Early Access".\nI don't know, maybe the Minimum devs wanted to force some trust on us by scooting out of Early Access early on, making us think the product is totally worth your time on that basis. That's a wild assumption, but what isn't is that this game is unfinished.\n\nGet on that.\n\nOnce these things are addressed, I'll look into writing a new review that will properly portray the potential fun this game could provide... when finished.","October 7, 2014","false","11.1"," 113 of 194 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","113","194","7","7"

It's just like this game claims to be.\n\nIt blends MOBA and arena shooter concepts in a way that feels seamless, resulting in a fast-paced, highly tactical, and strategically demanding gameplay environment that will leave you with the itch to hunt down any blockman, block-creature, and block-giant in your path.\n\nWeapon balance is pretty decent for the most part, although a few improvements can be made throughout this Early Access period.  The main balance complain seems to be over the katanas, but as of now, there have been plenty of counters and a variety of loadouts that have been able to take on katana users no sweat.  The simplest solution is to backpedal and shoot.  You can also craft armors that give you melee defense, higher speed, or higher jump to easily avoid katana users.  As for ambushes? Well, that's kinda what they are good at, so watch your back!\n\nAs you should expect from Early Access, the content isn't exactly vast and it has its fair share of bugs, but these are highly likely to be improved upon by the time the full release comes since Human Head Studios has proven itself to be making much progress and be highly community-involved.\n\nIf you like games like Unreal Tournament, Loadout, and LoL, then this game is for you.

The graphics are unique and easy to get lost into, it gives a really nice and smooth feel to the game which is nice for gamers looking for escapism. As soon as you get into a match you want to get kills to upgrade you weapon which motivates the fast paced aspect of the game and everyone wants to keep upgrading so you don't really find people camping and sitting around the map. The shop is a really nice feature to the game, you get points which you spend in the shop from killing players in game. At the moment there are a some guns and equips you can buy but I believe the shop can be expanded greatly and it does look like it's in early stage. There are a few maps at the moment but I believe players will become way less bored if they don't get repeats of maps and if there were more maps in the future with unique enviorments like there are now then my love for this game would grow greatly. I reccomend this game to anyone, it's extremely fun and addictive and in an early stage.

On sale at $3 for the holiday, I couldn't resist and gave it a shot. I'm glad I did, because this game is fantastic. It has a nice art style, plays smoothly, is a solid FPS, and has several great modes including a sort of MOBA-lite style, where you protect your titan's running down the middle to battle each other as you kill each other on the field beneath them.\n\nNice selection of weapons. You can upgrade weapons. Craft armor and devices. Upgrade things on the field as you level up and acquire resources (from killing other players). It seems some aspects are still in construct, but there is a lot of meat here, already. This deserves to be the next big multiplayer FPS. Not too fast, not too slow. Not too focused on leveling and progression, but not too stark so as to lose your interest if you're into making progression and ranking things up over time.\n\nAnd again, the art style and the maps. It just looks damn good. If the player base keeps up, this is worth the $10 USD. Otherwise, anything $5 USD and below is a steal.

The mechanics seemed simple enough and we were having a good time but then for some reason I was forced onto the other team away from my friends and that's when the awful mechanics started becoming more apparent.\n\n1: The game is pretty much filled with bots. If there aren't enough players to play, the server will be filled with bots, and to be completely honest, are just kill fodder which will come up at a later mechanic.\n\n2.The whole "MOBA" aspect is kind of forced. You don't really feel like you're accomplishing much by shooting a titan, it does very small damage and kind of feels like you're just powering them up with the creep waves to pit them against each other in a rock-em-sock-em robots match.\n\n3. The weapon upgrading system is broken. It's an interesting idea and I can see why they would put one in to put some semblance of needing "momentum", but there's two issues with what happens that need an explanation. As you get kills against other players, you get weapon power upgrades that go up to level 5 which are lost on death. These power upgrades have differeing effects based on which weapon you're using but the main thing that can be said is that it makes your gun better and do more damage. Now the two issues with this is, one: Bots make it very easy to get these level 5 upgrades and two: certain weapons are VERY powerful at max level. All I needed to do to pretty much steamroll was to get a few kills with a shotgun and then proceed to blaze around the map at insane speeds two shotting everyone.\n\n4. The game doesn't seem finished. I'm not actually even talking about the art assets/models, I get that it's supposed to look minimalistic, but it looks like there's some missing features.\n\n\nAn interesting idea, but really kind of falls apart due to poor design and mechanics choices.","January 11, 2015","false","2.8"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","33","57","3","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/recommended/214190/","LaggerCZE","Lagger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LaggerCZE/","137 products in account","Never thought guys who created Aliens: Colonial Marines would come up with this.\n\nSo, Minimum is a 'Just-came-out-of-early-access minimalistic 3rd person shooter with MOBA elements'. But that description is wrong about what it says: The game is not complete nor really minimalistic. Apparently, it's version 0.5something, and even though the armor system, base gameplay, weapon crafting and devices are generally done, it features only a couple maps, and the planned weapon upgrade system, structures and all the options that brings into the game aren't available yet. It also has a load of bugs, mainly in the UI and drop system, alongside with some sttutering during loading screens and occasional fails to end the program. It doesn't affect the main gameplay too much, though.\n\nThe second lie is 'minimalistic'. That's not what minimalistic really means. Sure, it doesn't have stupid drawings on the walls, nothing is lying on the ground, but the models are just blocky rather than being simple. Funnily enough, that gives the graphics an interesting charm - the blocky Titans, one color ground and upgrades that look like small futuristic car batteries go very well with all the lens flare everywhere.\n\nThe game itself then has three gamemodes: Team Deathmatch, Survival and Titan Mode. But right now I feel the game has actually only one gamemode truly worth playing - Titan Mode. In this particular one, five players on each side are pinned down in a conflict on a simple map featuring one main 'lane' and one or two 'Jungle areas', much like a MOBA would. The 'lane' is where giant robots named "Titans" march trough - meeting in the middle to fight to the death, where the winner may continue on to destroy the enemy's base. Bases are then made out of several parts - Power core, which is what the enemy needs to destroy to win, Turrets, which are your best hope to damage the enemy Titan after it destroyed yours, Spawn Rooms, whch are exactly what they sound like, and defensive walls, an equivalent of MOBA towers, which can be damaged only by Titans, and that usually combo with Turrets to keep the Titans under as much fire as possible. Titans, however, don't fight alone - players can help damage the enemy titan and destroy turrets, while the enemy team must be stopped from doing the same.\n\nBut then, the time comes - both Titans down. Then, the Creep Phase begins. The teams are informed that harmless creeps start spawning in pre-designated areas in the 'Jungle' map parts, where each killed creep drops a powerup that increases your Titan's strengh, making it more probable that it'll win the fight with the enemy titan. Of course, the enemy will do the same - so part of your team should start farming, when the other one should go interrupt the enemy's farming process to cripple them. Alongside with that there is the Golden Creep - faster version of the standart creep with more HP and no restrictions on it's position on the map - wandering around before it gets killed and drops a powerup worth ten times as much as a normal creep's. When time for this phase is up, titans respawn with their newfound strenght and the Titan phase begins once again. Rinse and repeat until the match time is up or one of the sides wins.\n\nThe PvP combat is based around weapons and armor. You can carry two weapons, one of which may be a meelee, one rechargable device, currently limited to several variants of grenades and turrets, and up to three different pieces of armor: Helmet, Chest armor and Leg armor. Each of these armor parts is crafted on the battlefield from armor shards and polygons (see the pun?), and can be upgraded up to level three. These resources drop every time a Titan is destroyed, a Creep is killed, a wall is broken or a player is killed. Each armor upgrade adds a small HP bonus, and also some kind of a special bonus, which in some cases comes with a disadvantage to keep things balanced. These armors come in sets - each with three individual parts, to provide a bonus to a specific playstyle, but you can mix different armor parts to match your personal one. These stay on you even after you die.\n\nWeapon upgrades, however, don't. Every time a turret is destroyed or a titan is destroyed, one blue weapon upgrade is dropped, which you or one of your allies may pick up to upgrade their current weapon by one level. Players, however, drop one upgrade if they don't have a weapon with level three or higher, and drop two of these if they do. Each upgrade increases damage and, beyond a certain differing point, adds the weapon a passive ability. Kills become necessary to have an advantage over your enemy, but with each level over them, the probability of you being focused down because you'll drop twice as much upgrades plus lose all your upgrades increases. This makes the action more dynamic, as you become more and more dangerous the longer you stay alive. Every weapon also features an rechargable active ability - dash, jump, burst fire or super powered projectile.\n\nOver all, I think this game is an idea that got ahead of it's age, but the game is still too uncomplete to be fully judged. Just look at the structure plans - there is one that would spawn weak combat creeps all around to slow down the enemy. I can still recommend it though - as long as you can take the bugs and the darn stupid camera most 3rd person shooters share.","September 21, 2014","true","14.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Scroll down for my views during the EAC.\n\nHaving returned to the game and given it a few more tries after it came out of Early Access I can definitely say I would not recommend this game as a purchase at the current moment.\n\nAs mentioned in my EAC review, this game has a whole lot of potential, but that alone is not enough to warrant paying for this game.\n\nBalance issues still exist. Devs and 'regulars' of the community continue to insist that weapons like the Giantkiller and other sword varients are easily counterable. The problem is their view of their own game is pretty short sighted.\n\nThe devs view so far concerning items/balance has been their damage outputs and offensive capabilities of armor and weapons. While that's needed, Minimum is one of those games where any slight change to your potential movement translate to HUGE advantages in combat.\n\nItems like Icarus Pants, swords, shotguns, and berserker pants all have the ability to completely spiral a game out of control.\n\nOn top of balance issues, my main concern has been that most of the items are hidden behind a grind system. Bought the autosniper because you thought it was cool but it turned out to be severly lacking in damage? Guess you're stick with it until you unlock it after grinding your next level.\n\nThere are interesting cosmetic items available to buy (which are a way of unlocking some weapons without leveling) but it feels like just an attempt at squeezing the last few dollars out of the last few dedicated groups of players.\n\nThe devs have spoken regarding this, and they're actually considering making items tradeable/sellable in the market and plan to give them unique modifiers. If that doesn't give you a hint of "pay to win" then I don't what will besides having to straight up buy each weapon.\n\nI initially bought this game in hopes of supporting a great idea from a great dev in the hope the dev would learn from their mistakes. I made this decision even with the knowledge that they were planning to add cash shops and weapon unlocks.\n\nSeeing how the game is developing, with half-baked changes and silly cash grabs instead of real content and consumer-friendly updates, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDoes Minimum have potential? Yes. Is it worth buying at this point? Absolutely not.\n\nI was initially on edge about buying this game (especially early access, which I've decided not to do anymore) but seeing that Human Head Studios, the creators of the Rune series, was making it I decided to make the jump and support them.\n\nThe game is pretty unbalanced, but this can be forgiven as it is early access and it seems the devs are pretty active at updating the game. The art style is hit or miss, personally I love it but I am sure a lot of people will not like it.\n\nThe game has a lot of potential, but other than that it's filled with a lot of balance issues.\n\nThe biggest issue in my opinion is you need to play many games to farm resources and unlock schematics. This wouldn't be an issue if it were for cosmetic items, but to place all weapons, armor, and items under this catagory is a problem. The idea of crafting your items on the fly is a great one, and opens up a lot of posibilities and variation as every item significantly affects your character's abilities and sometimes even your allies.\n\nTo force players to grind out those items puts you at a pretty clear disadvantage if you don't have the time to do so or you buy items that are not currently in the meta.\n\nThis isn't a free to play game (hell even F2P games like Dota 2 don't do this kind of thing) and shouldn't be treated as such. Until the system is changed, I can't recommend this game to anyone who takes competition seriously.","July 26, 2014","false","49.4"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","3"

It also manages to borrow from the MOBA genre for it's main gamemode "Titan" without detracting from skill based gunplay, so thoughtful equipment builds are equally important as reactions and aim.\n\nThe developers have done a great job of both paying attention to the community and acting on feedback in a fast manner for everything from bug reports to gameplay mechanics to weapon suggestions and level design.\n\nDefinitely recommended.","June 11, 2014","true","65.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","1"

Then in late 2015, it fell victim to development issues and became unplayable for quite some time. Now, it's back thanks to Human Head's persistence with their game. And it's as fun as ever.

Personally\nI hope you do the 1st because 90% of the time the 2nd one dries up and gets shut down.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n2: If turrents can kill you on there own, without bein manipulated by a player, then they should\ndirectly count as a kill, just as a player can kill you and they get credit for it.  Also I think Missile\nLaunching Turrents with longer range would be a good idea, balance the OP of the missiles with\na slower ROF, and make them expensive as ♥♥♥♥ to get crafting wise.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n3: It is going to be extremely dificlut to holp a player base, if level 3+4's keep having to fight\nand match up against level 12 and 16's.  There is no way anyone that low will stand a chance\nwith those kinds of odds agaisnt them.  Try to curb how easy it is to get OP weapons like:\nGrenade Launchers, Plasma Launchers, etc.  Make the most powerful Level restricted to levels:\n10-12 etc for Grenade and so forth. Also keep the same or higher crafting recipes for them.  Lower the Armor Crafting recipes a tiny bit. It feels more often then not that you spend a day or 2 playing just to choose between either an armor or a weapon.  Make lower level weapons much lower crafting recipe wise and make higher recipe weapons much higher.  Also for the love of god please nerf the ROF of the Plasma/Energy Cannons.....way way too often with the AOE/DAMAGE, the game quickly becomes all bout getting them and using nothign else.","July 6, 2014","true","8.0"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

However, I'm not sure this is a purchase worthy of your time. This game recently came out of Early Access but it still might need a little more time in the oven. The core shooting mechanics are solid, but the supporting features are disappointing. The "crafting" system is really just a specialized currency system that you use to purchase new equipment. Don't expect very much customization here. I couldn't even figure out how to change colors. The deathmatch and co-op survival modes are what they sound like, but the core "titan" mode is confusing. Your goal is to protect your titan while trying to destroy your opponents and their titan, but the strategy pretty much always boils down to a free-for-all. I was getting waxed over and over again. With no real class system beyond your weapon loadout, player direction is really lacking. I was just running around most of the time hoping for a kill and would suddenly find myself sliced in half by a high level player with a lightsaber katana. Whatever...the game is really cool looking and it's got lots of nice weapon effects.

Reminds me of super monday night combat, but I think minimum does it better. None of the weapons feel too weak/strong and have noticeable strengths and weakness. There's also some fun mechanics with certain weapons that work well, like the plasma launcher's shot redirect. The movement and hit registration is also great, feels very smooth and I believe that's the most important aspect of a game like this.\n\nOne thing I wish coming from a more competitive gaming background is weapon stat transparency. I really have no idea what weapons do what damage and so on, and the strength of certain special effects. For example, no idea what sniper has the best damage, and no clue what slow % the cryo sniper applies.\n\nOther than that I think this game is awesome and I will be putting many more hours into it.","March 10, 2015","true","6.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketSHIPlegs/recommended/214190/","rocketSHIPlegs","GoaT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketSHIPlegs/","88 products in account","I feel a little background info on gaming history is always helpful when choosing games so a brief intro.  The majority of my time spent PC gaming over my life has been dominated by Counter-Strike.  I could, and in my younger years did, play that game for 12+ hours a day when possible.  Minimum has many of the same qualities for longevity of interest that Counter-Strike does but in an entirely different package.\n\nThis is one of the most fun multiplayer games I have played, ever.  It's up there with UT99/UT3, Quake 2/3 and it's offshoots, Painkiller, HL2:DM, and while it has many CoD-like qualities it absolutely bests any of the non-WW2 games.  I know I'm having fun when time seems like it's flying; that only happens for me when playing the aforementioned games, running in the forest or cooking in a restaurant kitchen.\n\nThe netcode seems good but I have yet to play with above 80 ping so I can't comment on how it does above that threshold.  The game runs very well and looks good on systems ranging from new-5 years old.  A decent netcode and scalability are things that make or break these games so check that off as approved.  You don't need to change 6 or more settings with console commands to fix the game, it works fine out of the box.  Also, unlike CSGO, the bots in multiplayer are just adept enough to kill an above average player every once in a while and gives lower skilled players a decent challenge while waiting for a server to fill up.  Which, thanks to the matchmaking system, happens pretty quickly.\n\nAll of the maps are enjoyable to play and have resources scattered in heavily traveled areas to encourage engagement on a regular basis.  There have been a few games where the server was full and the majority of the players in the server were camping the far reaches of the map, action was hard to come by then.  For the most part games are near constant engagement followed by either a death or a short recovery/relocation so it's hard to get bored of playing.\n\nThere is a medley of guns and armor to choose from, all with their own intricacies to suit different playstyles.  If you like to run around and just wreck faces you will probably like a combination of Mini Launcher/Beam Rifle/Bullet Hell/Speedy Shotgun/Dash Shotgun with the Ninja chest and leg armor with a Berseker helmet.  All of the sniper rifles are useful in their own way, some are much better after getting powerups.\n\nAs a sniper you're not always in the best spot to pick up the resources before a teammate or enemy gets them so I would suggest avoiding the Rail Sniper unless you plan on being very mobile with it because all you will likely do with it is rack up assists, the Dash Shotgun or Beam Rifle is a good second weapon with it.  All of the other snipers are good for short-term long-distance engagement once you learn how to use each of them to their potential.  You still need to be more mobile than you would be in most modern FPS (CoD) games with a scoped weapon to keep gathering resources to at least give yourself a full armor stack before mid-point in a match.\n\nThe katanas are fun to play with but unless I'm in a server of low-skilled players/half of them are bots I don't rack up near as many kills or have a good K/D ratio had I decided to just use guns.  That said, I haven't messed around with them enough to give a competent recommendation on them.\n\nMaximized guns are a HUGE thing in this game.  10% more damage is no joke, do the math.  You can roll the dice on your 20% chance in crafting or you can just buy them on the marketplace.  A couple bucks will get you every Maximized gun you'll likely want to use and is well worth the price of admission.  I have $60 in CSGO skins/keys and they didn't make me any better at CSGO so this was a no-brainer once I saw them on the Market.\n\nI'm not the biggest fan of some of the in-game menu elements.  I often double click on the images only to realize I didn't actually craft the armor.  The symbols for accessing the gun loadout/crafting/store buttons confused me for the first few weeks I played the game, maybe I'm alone here.\n\nThis game is awesome and would only get better with a larger playerbase and more content.  I implore the gaming community to jump on this train.  At $35 for 5 copies you've made 5 people, up to 10 if you count significant others(!!!), happy they didn't spend $60 on a game that has a once-through storyline and about 30-40 hours of multiplayer before you move on to the next half-baked shooter.  Real joy in life comes from accomplishing personal goals and making others happy.  Knock out 2 birds with 1 stone, buy the 5 pack and gift the other 4 to your buds.\n\nIn short:\ngood, cheap game\nbuy a 5 pack\nhave fun\nprofit??","March 21, 2015","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

As of right now many features are not yet available but that does not bother me at all. Because what is available is quality. I love the stylized 3D graphics. It looks like a badass Tron shooter with just enough moba elements to make it a little different from most shooters. They should have stayed away from the word MOBA though. I know its the gaming buzzword of the decade but it sorta implies the game has lane pushing, rpg elements, deep strategies, which it doesn't. What it does have is double flaming katanas in a dope samurai setting and cool little arena shooter type stuff.\n\nIn the game you attack players, the other team's giant mech and creeps that spawn to power up your own team's Titan. The gameplay relys heavily on kill streaks, with each kill upgrading your current weapon with a new look and more power. Once you are killed you start over again. The animations are great, gameplay and movement are smooth. The crafting system is fun and gives the player something to play for. Adding armor to your character not only customizes your character but gives them stats as well. You can build your character for defense, offense, movement speed, etc.\n\nI'd like to see a mini-map, more levels and some weapon balancing but all that is to come in future updates. Swords are a little over powered but going on a 5+ kill streak with one is fantastic.\n\nMinimum sits a top of my competitive shooter list along with Nosgoth and Hawken. I think many were hoping it would be F2P and complained about the $20 price tag. This game is worth $20 easy. No buyers remorese here.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/PW4DS86trTA","May 26, 2014","true","7.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

If you are not familiar with SMNC, you should probably ignore this review :)\n\nThis game will not scratch your SMNC itch. There are no classes, just loadouts. You can switch loadouts during a match. There are currently two game modes, and it switches back and forth between them: team deathmatch and Titan. It is the Titan mode that is most like SMNC. In Titan mode there are two giant robots that head from home to enemy base. When they meet, they fight each other. There are also barriers that come up and in the base there are some feeble defenses against titans. Once the Titan defeats the defenses in the base the game is over. So, it is sorta like SMNC... but with a single (albiet giant) 'bot.\n\nTeams are 5v5 and you can leave/join whenever.\n\nDeath comes quickly, sort of like MNC or Turbo. You can build yourself and weapons up during the game with pickups, when you respawn you start that process over.\n\nVerdict: it may be a good game, but it is not an SMNC replacement. Perhaps 10-20% of SMNC gameplay elements.\n\nOutside of SMNC: I was not pulled in by the game on its own merits. There are plenty of other similar games out there, not sure how this is all that different.","August 25, 2014","true","2.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I would recamend to wait for this game to be relaunched, and once it does buy it, becuase the gameplay is quite fun. some positives and negatives:\n+The designs of the weapons are very nice even though the style throughout is minimalistic.\n+Even though the graphics arent top notch, the gameplay makes up for it.\n+swords.\n+The gameplay: The genra of this  game is basically a moba mixed in with GIANT MECHS. And also guns and swords. It is also a third person shooter as seen in the trailer.\n+The main focus of the game, THE FREAKING MECHS!( and dinos too) Also gorillas are a thing too??\n-Swords. The reason why this is in both negative and postive catagories is even though swords do look awesome essicapply when upgraded and *evolved* They are. SO. OP. But if using the out of place targeting system is diffuclt, then using a combo of sniper rifle and sword is what I would recammend.\n-Matchmaking. Now This one is a bit wierd in my terms. Matchmaking can pair you up with reiduously high leveled opponents, and vice versa. Also The enemy team can consist of people just using swords, which can get quite annoying.\n-usefulness of weapons. Sometime there will be somewhat pointless guns that really dont help at all. For example theres a minigun( I forget the name of it) that had reboudning and boucning bullets, which can also hit your own teammates. Also gernades are kinda point less. This is beucase if your trying to hit someone with a gernade and they happen to have a shotgun(which btw allows you to DOUBLE JUMP!) then they can just jump over the blast. if they are using swords they can dash past the gernade, catch of gaurd and kill you in the process.\n\nLong story short, like many other games Minimum has its flaws and it truly is worth your money. But I would personally hold off buying it until the devs bring it back to the diamond in the rough it was.\nHave a good day.\n\nEDIT: ITS BACK. Its currently in a sort of mini beta as they put it, so once its fully realesed to be purchased  buy it. DO IT.

I kid you not, a game where literally the entire world and all it's characters are made from untextured cubes, the game has framrate issues on lowerend pcs. secondly, on top of that, matches come standard with massive amounts of rubberbanding, and just general lag. players have a tendency to intermitently teleport all over the place (which is made worse due to the fact that there is a dash funtcion on several of the games weapons). at it's worst I had a case where I was in spawn, hit the dash button, and sprint buttons at the same time and started flickering back and forth for about half a second until I remateralized at the center of the map (come to think of it that would be a cool game mechanic. too bad it's just a massive glitch!)\n\nnow that I've touched on the games massive technical issues, there are several game balance and design issue that I feel I should mention for starters the game has a really stupid progression system. basically because the game has moba elements, it has an in match crafting and resource system that acts very similarly to gold farming and item buying in mobas. it's a really neat mechanic IMO. the problem is that there is ANOTHER resource and crafting system OUTSIDE of matches that you have to use to craft the blueprints that you use in match to craft the items! I can't think of any other moba-esque game the forces you to unlock the ability to purchase in match items OUTSIDE OF MATCHES! and for good reason! it's really stupid! admittedly the default blueprints that they give you are pretty good, and it doesn't take much time to unlock all of the rest of them, but it's still unessecary, unjustified, and annoying for new players as it limits their ability to adapt their build.\n\nthere are numerous other potentially game breaking balance issues, such as a sniper rifle that when fully powered up makes it's targets unable to move, which isn't very fun to play against, melee weapons are a bit too strong/easy to use, etc.\n\nTL;DR this game has truely amazing potential, but it's no where near there yet.

I believe they are also why some of the maps feel very closed in and overall don't lend themselves to great shooter gameplay.\n\nSome weapons don't seem to offer any benefits over others, for example the cryo rifle looks to be superior to the rail rifle in every way despite the rail rifle having a delayed charged shot that you have to track while charging; it doesn't feel like it does more damage despite increased skill requirements. The grenade launcher seems to be inferior to the plasma launcher in every way. Swords are significantly more useful than shotguns, especially with more useful alt fires to escape with.\n\nMap design is the weakest aspect of the game likely because of the divided focus between shooting and melee.\n\nMaybe if they get things to a more balanced state and make some better maps it will be worth picking up in the future.

It gave me the same sensation I got when playing Halo: Reach, but without feeling derivative. The likeness of sensations was akin to the similar feeling given between C.o.D. and Titanfall; though vastly different in mechanics, the pace and personality seem to place both in the same sub-genre of shooter.\n\nWhile many of the subsidiary parts of the game appear as though they were taken from various popular bandwagons, this is only skin-deep. Blockish shapes and crafting imply Minecraft; bloom, particle effect styling, vivid colour, and map design smack of Halo: Reach; looming, powerful titans reek of Titanfall; and a reward system for kills even evokes thoughts of C.o.D. 6. However, among metaphorical covers of books, this is a dust jacket on a hardback. And, like with many literal dust jackets, the fanciful mainstream picture it portrays serves as a ruse to lure people from the mainstream. The hardcore casual-gamers and fanatics of the bandwagon are its target solely in advertising. Its aims at A) the kinds of people who game all day, but only play games GameStop has had window cut-outs for, and other games like it, or B) the kinds of people who bandwagon Minecraft so hard they think sinuosity-less geometry is more revolutionary than a 1790s Frenchman.\n\nNow that we’ve covered what this game isn’t, let’s talk about what it is. This game is a fast paced third person shooter with a balanced leveling system that takes the “grind” out of grinding –which only leaves the “ing”. While this is bad wordplay, its excellent gameplay; there is no tedium trying to power up your gun or rank up your armor, no playing 15 minutes of a match before earning something more useful than a UAV, and no angry obsession with getting the higher K/D (well it doesn’t induce it for those who don’t normally have it), just pure dynamic gun-play. Like in Hotline Miami, dying is near unnoticeable as you can plunge right back into the action seconds after death, and like in TF2 a decent size death streak early game doesn’t feel like a set-in-stone “gg” for the match. Whereas C.o.D. rewards garnered from kills feel like giving the winning team an even bigger edge, the rewards for kills in Minimum feel more balanced, and are very fluidly gained and lost temporarily mixing up gameplay more than giving team advantage. The crafting system tries really hard to sound like Minecraft in all of its descriptions, but really the out of match crafting is just a well-paced (unlike C.o.D.) unlock system, and in match crafting is just a cleverly disguised skill-tree/upgrade system based on collecting two types of materials that drop from dead bodies like bolts do from Ratchet & Clank.\n\nThe pseudo “Titanfall rip-off” gametype, titan, is the main game mode, and the most pleasingly surprising part of the dust jacket. The titans are autonomous, and respawn in alternating waves with resource gathering (which powers up your team’s titan in the next titan wave). Not only this, but the Titans are interested in only two things 1) killing the enemy team’s titan, and 2) brute-force getting past map-based defenses to destroy the enemy core. Now here’s the plot twist. This objective-based game mode style is the same as League of Legends, but in a faster, less tactic-focused cartographically, shooter format. The game mode is much simpler than League’s version of it, yet this seems like an apt adaptation for the genre and pace of the game. You are to the titans what minions are to players in League, but with an additional neutral-team of sub-minions (four-legged rectangular creatures called creepers –I mean creeps) that players grind to power up their titans. Its League dynamic with roles jumbled up.\n\nTeams try to progress further into enemy territory with every respawn while the two team’s minions attack both the larger entities and minions from the other team. The grinding to power up the large entities still exists, and is still fulfilled by the player grinding easily killed herds of enemies. It takes the dynamic of player and minion, and divides it up to accommodate the game’s genre and sub-genre. You still power up your character (with a better balance retention in 1v1 encounters) by killing enemies, the “more powerful the enemy you kill, the more power you gain” still applies, the core objective of teams fighting past turrets (and walls) to destroy the enemy core while aided by smaller/weaker allies still exists, and the many choices of character build based in a per-match system is carried through, but it doesn’t let any of it get in the way. The grinding creatures that are smaller than the player are neutral and don’t attack players, which keeps the combat PvP focused rather than worrying about fighting the creeps as well as making the grinding competitive as both teams try to kill the same creatures –again keeping the focus on outplaying the other players not AI. The grinding of the creeps powers up your titan as well as you, and does so via automatic stat increases, so your upgrading process is kept mostly separate from tipping the scales in objective progress; the better you grind the better your team can progress through to objectives, but that’s as far as your thoughts need go on the subject. Your titan being the only one to agro enemy walls, turrets (map turrets not mini turrets deployed by players), and titans means you don’t have you have breathing room to deal with the enemy players. Similarly, your titan being the only one capable of fighting map defenses, as well as it being solely focused on doing so, means that you don’t have to worry about whether or not you need to go for the objectives/map defenses in lieu of your incompetent teammates –at most you have to attack the titan so it doesn’t get to far into your territory. Lastly, titans killing the enemy core being the only way to win ensures that the dynamic of winning doesn’t live and die with your K/D, but playing strategically still doesn’t get in the way of the focus of competing against enemy players in the unique grind & gun gameplay so much as it does compliment it.\n\nThe summation of these things gives a game that feels both distinct and original, yet induces a mood when gaming perhaps not felt since games like Unreal Tournament 4, Halo: Reach (please don’t try to tell me Halo 4 exists -it’s like New Jersey, or Crocs, in that nothing so abhorrent could be real), and Quake III Arena. It paces upgrades well, the unlock system is priced (with in-game currency) excellently, and it has enough variety both when upgrading by loadout and by in-match-progression to offer accommodate many play styles (that feel noticeably different rather than different but same feeling as between different Borderlands guns). As far as titan mode goes, the strategic progression toward achieving objectives feels complimentary to the fast pace death-match happening around it, while allowing individuals to prioritize approach from a League style mindset or a Reach style mindset with equal impact on the team’s collective winning or losing. Keeping in mind this game is in early access and will likely see a lot more additions to the weapons, armor, and other upgrades/loadout choices, this game is well worth the buy. In terms of bugs, developer dedication, and regular (meaningful) updates I’d say this is one early access I think would be safe to support by buying now rather than waiting till “release”, and even in its current state it seems worth it for $5 (on sale). If you liked Reach, or fast paced shooters, I recommend this game.","September 12, 2014","true","8.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There's a bit of a learning curve, but unlike other MOBAs, the curve here is faster and you'll be ready to rock in just a few games.\n\nThe games are currently short but sweet (compared to the more traditional MOBA), which fits in with the fast-paced combat in the game. Is it Call of Duty twitchy? No, but it is decently fast combat with some Quake/Unreal Tournament flavors to it.\n\nTeamwork is essential, although if you get powerful enough, you might be able to hunt down enemy players. One of the thrills of this game is trying to survive as long as possible to hold on to your upgrades. If you die, you lose the weapon upgrades leading to another adrenaline-pumping fight to the top.\n\nI enjoy this game, but if you're looking for a traditional MOBA, look elsewhere.

It still needs some refinements and constant updates but has a lot of potential.\n\nMinimum follows a 3rd-person FPS game coupled with a couple different game mechanics. First impressions of the game aren't too shabby. Graphics and menus are easy to read and is easy for new players to adjust. The game splits into 3 game modes (with *hopefully* more upcoming), Deathmatch (50 kills per side), Titan Mode (clear a path for the AI titan to reach the enemy), and Horde (survive waves). The game is relatively fast paced with 5v5 player matches and a multitude of armor/weapon loadouts.\n\nGameplay Mechanics\nStarting with Deathmatch, the game is relatively simple. Start with a character with customizable loadouts with various weapons and kill the opposing team. Killing opponents drops special items that can be used to upgrade your weapon (until you die) and armor (until the game ends).\n\nTitan Mode is essentially AI-contolled Titanfall in a way where players can kill each other and kill "creeps" to obtain titan crystals to power up your team's titan to defeat the enemy's titan and reach the final point of the match.\n\nOther Mechanics\nThe crafting system is a blueprint + resources = new weapons/armor. Unlocking blueprints requires materials/currency given at the end of each match while certain blueprints require specific "cubes" to unlock (gained by leveling up).\n\nPro | Con\n+ Lots of loadout customization\n+ Fast paced combat\n+ Clean UI\n+ User-friendly for beginners\n\n- 3rd person viewing can be glitchy/slow\n- Needs more optimization to reduce lag\n- Fixing small disconnections\nCould use a larger player base\nNeeds constant optimization updates\nMore gamemodes, maps, weapons, armor\n\nRecommendations\nPersonally, I would recommend this to people who would like this system of tiered combat, "blocky" style of graphics, and 3rd person shooters. However, I would play this on occasion as it offers no new incentives to playing continously (needs more gamemodes/items/weapons).\n\nRating: A-","September 20, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/recommended/214190/","comradesniper","gr8stalin's mustache!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comradesniper/","528 products in account","I thought it would be nice to write a straightforward review for those who appreciate it, because a lot of the reviews here so far just rely mostly on hyping up their experience to make the game sound good. Minimum is a fun and solid game, possibly on track to be the next big thing for PC shooters.\n\nHowever, when looking at Minimum it’s hard to find anything terribly unique about the game after playing the games that make up its core. Honestly, it’s just a hodgepodge of mechanics different games: creep farming from MOBA/ARTS/ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S, civilian escort from TFC (payload from TF2), armor tiers from Quake, in-game crafting from RPGs, etc. It’s a very minimalist style of game that still manages to not look like a piece of indie garbage (aka the game has an artstyle instead of just “I LOVE X TYPE OF GAME LET ME JUST COPY ALL OF THE AESTHETICS FROM IT”). It’s a very functional game and has lots of potential to be fun, but it’s just nothing terribly special and I can’t really give it a whole lot of praise for breaking any new ground.\n\n“B-b-but it’s just fresh out of Early Access!”\nRelax.\n\nIn a time where the shooter market is focused mostly on console shooters and CounterStrike, it’s good to see a multiplayer arcade FPS take the scene with the promise of a fun multiplayer experience. The game is very fair in terms of hardware specs and can run on a variety of semi-modern setups. Getting kills and watching your gun go from basic to a beast of warfare makes me grin. There are lots of weapons to choose from but your basic weapons are still VERY viable, and it’s very easy to get the weapons you think might be fun to play with by just playing the game. You can customize several class loadouts for plenty of situations, and there’s a little cash-shop for alternate skins if one so feels the need to grab one to be a special snowflake. The maps are for the most part well-designed: it’s easy to get from point A to point B and figure out the general and some specific nooks & crannies of a map within a single round. There aren’t any particularly terrible parts of the maps that I’ve played where one player has been able to lock down a certain area just by existing. A majority of the weapons are Unreal Tournament/Quake derived (more UT than Quake), and there are old standards and familiar faces returning like a grenade launcher, rail gun, lightning gun, shotgun, plasma, and so on.\n\nIt should be easy to deduce from the trailers and Steam page that you’ll be playing in third-person. It’s got controller support but I can’t imagine why anyone would want to put themselves at that much of a disadvantage for a team-based arena shooter with a twist. When playing in-game, the more kills you get, the more damage you weapon can do and in some cases, the wider of an area of effect it has. You counter this by building into two currently existing armor types (to start): Knight and Berserker. The former is focused on protection and anti-Titan ability at the cost of player speed, and the latter is focused on dealing damage and brawling other players at the cost of protection and health. Using these armor types, players have to work together to keep their Titan safe while doing whatever they can to destroy the other team’s Titan. When both teams have their Titans destroyed, the game goes into a “creep farming” phase where both teams hunt small creatures for personal resources to upgrade their weapons and armor, while each creep kill boosts your Titan’s power. There’s a Golden Creep that gives a very large bonus to a Titan’s power, and it can keep the field even if a team lacking in creep farm grabs it or be the key to victory for the dominant team.\n\nHowever, there are some problems that plague Minimum. As with any game that has some element of MOBA/ARTS/ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S in it, it’s easy for one guy to feed the other team and let them climb the armor tiers a lot easier (one game I played just recently had me and one other guy with 2+/1 KDR while the guy at the bottom of our team was 2/35 and it took us an age to move forward). It’s also easy to just have everyone completely forget about killing creeps and just have underpowered Titans keep brawling each other; conversely, it’s also easy to have one team completely remember and the other completely forget and have a super-fast game.\n\nThere are quite a few connection issues with the game because there are a lot of moments where I end up thinking that the game is peer2peer. Rubberbanding is prevalent everywhere, but most commonly with those who end up dashing around with melee only. This is generally frustrating because someone will just hold W into you and you’ll shoot him, and suddenly he’ll stretch behind you and you’ll miss that one shot needed to keep yourself alive. It’s probably the biggest issue I’ve got with the game so far because it’s really easy to abuse with the Taser Shotgun, which will segway into the next paragraph.\n\nIn terms of complaining about balance, I’m not a fan of movement-impairing effects. I haven’t had any problems with anyone using the Cryo Rifle, but the Taser Shotgun is simply frustrating to play against. It goes against the arena shooter maxim of having freedom of movement and is a carry-over from the MOBA/ARTS/ASS♥♥♥♥♥♥S themes of the game. I also am not a huge fan of the deployable player turrets because it’s particularly easy to deploy any time (beginning, middle, end) during a fight and at the very least make the job of a teammate getting an avenger kill for you that much easier.\n\n“B-b-but they’ll patch it!”\n“G-g-g-git g-g-gud!”\nRelax.\n\nLike any other multiplayer or co-op game, Minimum is best played with friends. I wouldn’t mind seeing a LAN option or true private server option in the future, and by the looks of it Minimum can have a bright future ahead of it. I just hope Human Head Studios doesn’t fall to the cries of the majority begging for melee-only hold +forward to win or some other vocal group. I also hope that those XP-based mod slots on weapons don’t become a thing. I really hope they don’t. I hope Human Head Studios learned from the mistakes of Loadout. I really hope they did.\n\nAll in all, even though I can’t really praise Minimum for setting any standards or breaking any new ground, I would recommend Minimum if you’re looking for a new yet familiar experience in the shooter market. I'm ready to see how Human Head Studios keeps Minimum going, and I hope it's in a good way.\n","September 14, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"

There's just so much missing.\n\nI was suprised to find out out how much this game really lacks when it comes to it's features. Basic stuff like soundeffects such as footsteps is screaming with their lack of pressence. As of writting this it seems they have lately put out a fair amount of updates with a hint about keeping the pace up. I hope that is so because this came have a huge potential if it gets the attention and love it needs.\n\nRight now you are tossed into a minimalistic world with customizable loadouts where you run around fighting, gaining rewards and as the match progresses you use the rewards to craft armour. Each kill drops a powerup that strenthens your weapon up to five times. All lost each time you die though. At the same time you use 2 different pickups to create on the spot new armourpieces and upgrade them.\nThe weapons have two firemodes. Depending on which weapon secondary might not even be an attack. There's a shotgun that has a highjump skill as secondary that is excellent to get out of fights or evade enemies. Meleewise you get a sword from the start that has a dash on secondary and as it you power it up it goes from one single boring plain stick to a dualwielding glorious flailing wall of death. All that seems really fun and proves the developer aren't afraid to break the classic mold of run'n gun shooters so we might see some awesome stuff in the future.\n\nBesides primary and secondary weapons you also have a slot for a device in the loadout. Here you equip grenades, turrets and mines. Not to much options yet but so far all I've tried have been useful and served it purpose.\n\nWhen it comes to gamemodes there are as of writting this three to pick from.\n-Team deathmatch, just as basic as it sounds really.\n-Horde mode, coop battling against waves of bots which seems a bit unbalanced and strange as bots can spawn on top of you. Clearly far from done.\n-Lastly we have the Titanmode. this is the gamemode held up as whats it all about. Two teams fighting against eachother over creeps to strengthen their titans and have it push into enemy base for victory.\n\nWith all this said and from what I can see in the interface I really hope this game can get it together and accomplish its goals. But I wouldn't recommend it as a must buy for anyone. Only those interested in seeing a game evolve should really buy it as it is now. Is it fun? Yes, but it is so incomplete and lacking in features that it really is for curiousity and willing to support you should buy the game. Not to actually play it. Better not burn out on it now and get to have all the funs later when it is more fun to be had.","September 6, 2014","true","9.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 9x9-inch pan with nonstick spray, then line with a strip of parchment paper so that it covers the bottom and comes up two sides of the pan. Spray the parchment with nonstick spray too.\n2. In a microwave safe bowl (or in the top of a double boiler or pan set on top of a pan of simmering water), microwave in 30 second bursts to melt butter and chocolate chips together until all is melted and smooth. Whisk in the sugars, then whisk in the eggs, vanilla and salt. Sift flour into the bowl and stir that in too. Scrape the brownie batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the brownie layer is cooked through (toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean). Place the pan of brownies in the refrigerator to speed up the cooling process (or cool at room temperature and add the cookie dough layer later).\n\nPrepare the cookie dough layer:\n3. In a large bowl, use an electric mixer to combine the butter, sugars and salt until soft and creamy (1 to 2 minutes). Mix in the milk and vanilla. Sprinkle in the flour and mix in until combined. Stir in the 1 cup of chocolate chips. Scoop the cookie dough onto the top of the brownies and spread onto the brownie layer. I find that it's easiest to do this if the brownie layer is chilled and firm. Wet your hands or spray them with nonstick spray and pat the cookie dough on top in a even layer. Sprinkle additional chocolate chips on top to create a nicer, visual appearance. For easy, clean cutting, chill the brownies (wrap the brownies with plastic wrap and chill until firm- 1 to 2 hours or up to 2 days).\n4. Cut the brownies: Run a knife along the sides of the brownie pan and then use the parchment paper to lift the brownies from the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice the brownies with a sharp knife, wiping the knife with a paper towel between cuts. If you'd like all of your slices of brownies to look clean-cut without edges, use the knife to cut the sides of the brownies off before cutting pieces. Keep brownies slices covered and chilled until ready to serve.\n","February 28, 2015","true","11.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","63","5","8","10","1"

Yes, if you're caught out of position by a sword-wielding opponent, you're dead.  Launchers are excellent on small maps where players tend to bunch up and are vulnerable to splash damage.\n\nOn the other hand, if you pay attention to enemy positions and fight at range, swords are useless.  If you stay out of big melees and work the angles, launchers can be countered.  If there's any area where there are balance issues, I'd say it's in the armors.  A big portion of the armor selections are next-to-useless.  Which would you rather have: a helmet that gives a 5% damage bonus for shotguns and rifles, or a helmet that gives a 5% damage bonus for you AND all your nearby teammates for ALL WEAPONS?  Could use some tweaking.\n\nStrategy and teamwork are very important in this game.  Combining weapon loadouts that synergize, and choosing the right armor can make the difference between a useful loadout and one that can't get anything done.  I really appreciate how leveling up and unlocking new weapons and armor opens up new styles of play, while the starting weapons and armor never stop being useful.  Sticking together with your team is critical, as it's almost impossible to win a two-on-one fight (if your opponents know what they're doing anyway).\n\nThe map design is great.  Mobility and positioning are a key element of strategy, particularly on Titan maps, which have opportunities for sword ganking, sniping, and everything inbetween.\n\nPersonally, I've been waiting for a game to attempt this kind of art style for a long time.  It's very reminiscent of Mirror's Edge, so if you like the visual style of that game, you'll enjoy the look and feel of Minimum.\n\nThat said, it really shows that the game is still in development.  There aren't a lot of servers, the automatching often puts you on servers with no players, I've exprienced some audio/visual bugs, and I'm pretty sure the "Pickup Hell" weapon, that claims to make creeps drop more items, doesn't actually do what it says.  On one of the Titan maps, I fell into a crack and was stuck until an opponent killed me (The Event).  I would like to see more maps, of course, and I feel that the Horde mode would be more fun if the difficulty level didn't ramp up quite so fast (I haven't seen anyone make it past the third wave without heavily exploiting the enemy AI and level design).\n\nOverall, a really fun third-person shooter that, I hope, will continue to improve.  It's $10 US, so buy it if you're sick of CoD.  What do you have to lose?","October 16, 2014","true","28.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However, it may take about 15 minutes to find a match. You can only press the automatch button once per game, meaning that you have to close everything down inbetween matches, which is even more problematic as the quit button itself doesn't do anything, so the only way to exit the game is through the task manager, which you are forced to do every time you want to play.\n\nThe game itself will get repetitive and boring after a few hours. You can grind to unlock new weapons, but if you try and do that then the devs will probably reset everybodies progress again.

If one guy gets a bunch of temporary powerups on his weapon(which are gained from kills). He easily dominates the game about 2 minutes in.\n-No leave penalty (Beta issue that should be resolved)\n-Matchmaking. I do not know if there is any, but my last match I played was very imbalanced. Enemy teams user level was 5+ while my team was 3 or less. Felt like Call of Duty matchmaking.\n-Melee weapons might need a nerf or ranged need a buff. Many times I peppered an enemy just to have him walk up to me and cut me down in one swing.\n-Only main game mode (Titan Mode) is avaliable.\n\nFor a while I enjoyed it. The game is fun but what turned me off from it was how the handle the player drop in system. Its very counter mobaish but it made no sense to me. In one game a large amount of people just quit out. Which left the game 3 v 4 (my team having the 3). I go along play against the heavly leveled stacked team. Learning the trick to toss a grenade straight down to kill them off after they cut you in half with one swing. I then take a look at the scoreboard. It turned into a 3 v 5! How the hell does that happen?! No one joined my team at any point. I was always waiting for that balancing player to come in and help the team out but that never happened. It was depressing.\n\nMaybe down the line I will give it another try, but as of now.

Simple team vs team fun. Graphics are suprisingly good despite the simplistic appearance (The effects compensate neatly). Weapons are pretty balanced.\n\n-People seem to say that once a weapon is charged it gets OP. Now tough i can't deny that if you go 1vs1 against one with higher upgrade you will probably fail, but in group fights it tends to even out as the ones with upgraded weapons will be the biggest target for the enemy group. The true cause of this "upgraded is OP" debate is that if you are a skilled player you will get the upgrades fast. The best players ive seen sofar always seem overpowered, but they are simply awesome.\n-Microtransactions: *sigh* as demanded by the corporate overlords at Atari the game does have Microtransactions. i can clearly see that is the cause as it seems like a fish out of water. It serves no real purpose except try and monetize some cosmetic items which feel out of place in a game like this which where nobody cares how you look! MT is there, but people hardly pay attention.\n\nSo would i advice it? Yeah! Its a pretty fun game with a less serious graphic style and yet the epicness of its less minimalistic siblings. tough i would suggest to wait a little longer till its on sale (Winter-sale is coming afterall!).

This includes some server issues, weapon maximization, deployables and structures (although the last two are only available in horde mode for now).\n\nOverall Impression\nThis is a great game once you get past the short comings of weapon balances and the sometimes poor server connections. The weapons, despite their balance issues, are fun to use and there are several varying weapons to choose from.

Its art style is fantastic, as is its music, the amount of blueprints for crafting is good, and the gameplay is pretty fluid.  Three things concern me at this point.  I left Loadout to play this game believing it had greater potential.  I still believer that.  However, I didn't realize certain things I missed from that other game.  The first thing is player population.  This will inevitably go up in time, but it's still pretty disapointing how long I have to wait for a good match to start in game.  Secondly, why is there no ADS (aim down sights) in this game? That seems pretty moronic.  It's too easy to kill people, and your skill doesn't get differentiated from anybody else's as a result.  I have seen there to be an ADS mechanic with snipers which is good, but i believe it should be extended to all weapons.  Lastly, I believe the game needs to add a dodge mechanic pronto.  That's one of the reasons swords are so OP at this point.  If a person has great map knowledge, you're at a severe disadvantage if you're a sword user.  Dodging would help immensely, as well as to escape gunfire.  Things like more maps are obviously going to be added which is why I'm not including them, but the issues such as ADS and dodging are a core issue with the game, which may not get fixed.  Loadout, whether you're a direct competitor or not, will blow this game out of the water with player population if you don't.  Likewise, this game can steal alot of that game's thunder with some careful tweaking.","July 13, 2014","true","280.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","5"

I was skeptical about it but I bought it and I am so ♥♥♥♥ing happy with it. The game definitely is still in early access and you can tell, there are buttons, tabs that don't go anywhere just yet, there are certain elements that will become crucial in the game that haven't arrived. But nevertheless the game still has a lot to offer at this point and will only continue to grow.\n\nThe art style, game modes, weapons + weapon customization (only a bit of customization), controls and gameplay are all really fantastic. I have a blast playing the two modes they have in game currently which is the titan mode and the team deathmatch mode. The only thing I'm fearful of is microtransactions. I have not looked up if they are going to add microtransactions but just by the way that you buy weapons which is the these little cubes that act as currency, I can't help buy think that they may add it. Either way this is a great game and has a lot of potential in the future. I give it a 7.5/10 for this stage in its early access.","June 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One or two shots will stop them in their place, keep your distance and finish them off with another weapon, the slow effect last about 4 seconds  which is enough to finish them off.

Although there is a nice variety of choice for melee and ranged weapons, it's only once you begin to observe the interaction through playing the game that you start to notice the problems with balance.\n\nFirstly, although the swords are a nice edition it makes the gameplay in multiplayer somewhat frustrating as there is little balance of ability to defer a sword attack if you have a ranged weapon, especially with people spamming the jump button every second (I will return to this point). The problem you get particularly with this is that you will damage a sword wielder to close to their death but with all the hopping around they do, ultimately they will run around an object that covers them before running back out with recovered health and quickly spamming to kill you.\n\nThe second major problem stems from some of the purchased armour which to an extent makes parts of this game "Pay to win" wherein I have seen people buying outfits to make them jump higher over and around players with large weapons making them very hard to hit and avoid their attacks due to their ability to jump far higher than any other average player, this is a serious problem in terms of combat balance in multiplayer as it means that not only can they jump above you and kill you faster, but it also means that they can escape to areas you would not be able to access as easily yourself without paying for the same privelege of armour.\n\nBar this the gameplay is very fun and engaging and there is a lot of potential for great things once player balance is focussed on a little more.\n\nCurrently 5/10 with potential to be 8 or 9/10.","September 18, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you feel like reading one with more content though head over to  RealGamerReviews  [realgamerreviews.com]\n\nNOTE\nThe game has been updated twice since my review was posted, and some of the things in my review actually got addressed. This includes some server issues, weapon maximization, deployables and structures (although the last two are only available in horde mode for now).\n\nOverall Impression\nThis is a great game once you get past the short comings of weapon balances and the sometimes poor server connections. The weapons, despite their balance issues, are fun to use and there are several varying weapons to choose from. Titan mode now feels like it has actual depth and also promotes teamwork much better than its first itteration.

All in all, these things tend to blend together quite well. Collecting resources to create new weapons is not difficult, and is better than grinding for XP to get a decent weapon. Even beginners can score kills and points really early on, and learning how to play is quick.\n\nPros:\nNot too grindy crafting system, countered by the fact you may only need to craft a select few items you want\nGreat aesthetic\nGreat models (Armor + weapons)\nFun gameplay\nBeginners can get into the game quickly + easily\nNeat armor system to buff, and consequently, debuff stats\n\nCons:\nNo music in-game apart from when titants are moving. Makes the game feel empty\nOnly 2 gamemodes. Cannot choose a specific one, they must be shuffled\nLimited number of maps\nKatana fights are boiled down to "Spam click and spin mouse until you kill your opponent"\nDisconnecting from the host is far too common, resulting in a return to the main menu","June 24, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, with this art style it makes me wonder why I can only get 10 frames a second. Im just rendering blocks as well as some shading and effects. I dont have a very powerful computer, but what I have should be able to run this game relatively well on low or minimal settings. It says the recomended is 8 gigs of ram, but I didnt see it use all of the 4 gigs I have, and it didnt use all of my CPU power which passes the 2.0 GHz standard for the game. While it would be fun to play from what I can tell, and I can accept its early access and all, but save your money if you dont have a very powerful computer.

Just buy it and stop wasting time reading comments. If $10 is all you got, spend it here.\nThis is the shooter I've been looking for.\nI highly recomend this game. It has found a balance between simplicity and amazing value.\nIt has just the right amount of customization (not too much to slow you down and enough to keep you entertained for a long time) and you can be a totally different fighter every match.\nPros:\nYou don't need a great computer to enjoy the great things this game has to offer. Just tone down the settings a bit if your computer is outdated (the way this game is setup, it looks pleasing on any setting).\nGood developers who actually give a **** about player's opinions.\nCool game modes (I like titan fights but I play team deathmatch just as much).\nGood bots (actually fight and folow objectives and are coded pretty well).\nThe leveling and scavanging system are setup better than any shooter I've played so far (and thats saying a lot considering the amount of time I've played shooters when I used to be a console peasant).\nCons:\nBots (NPCs used to fill lobby's when not many players are on your current server) say the same things over and over and are slightly annoying. They things they say seem like slightly realistic peasant comments, so you won't notice in the beginning.\n\nThey say things such as:\n"launchers op"\n"niice"\n"sword noob"\n"damn"\n"lol"\n"XD"\n"yeeeeaaaaa"\n"go team" - they say this even if there losing\n\n................................................\n\n\n-Like I said, all in all, this game deserves every penny (and more) of the measly $10 it asks for and will easily pay you back ten-fold if you give it your time. Also consider the fact that there will be more added, but you don't need to worry about that because this game is great as is. Please buy this game so we can have even more players and allow this game to live for a good while because it deserves it.","January 3, 2015","true","29.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is borderline BROKEN. Well first, this game is fun BUT ONLY WHEN PLAYING HORDE MODE!!! Horde mode is really the only mode that doesn't have Level 5 Katana rushers charging at you every minute. Katanas are what breaks the game.\n\nReasons:\nLevel 1 Katana takes 3-4 strikes to kill.\nKatanas make you impossible to hit especially when the frames are down, but I'll ge to that.\nKatanas give you a speed boost.\nWHAT WERE YOU THINKING?!?!?! Absolutely not! How I think this situation should be remedied. Katanas give you a -30% health detriment. No speed bonus. (Why would you need a speed bonus when your katana has a built-in dash function already?)\n\nOkay, I think I've covered the Katanas. Now onto the snipers. VERY, VERY HARD. Do not come into this game thinking you'll be blowing robot's heads off left and right. No. The headshot hitbox is TINY. Honestly, come on. You're zooming around the battlefield at 30 MPH and the hitbox is literally the size of the head, which I get, because why should you be able to kill someone with a headshot when it would normally go right past their ear? Well, it's impossible to hit. And snipers take 2-3 shots to kill.\nHow to remedy: Snipers get a 40% faster rate of fire. PLEASE IT IS SO SLOW. Second, Make a sniper 1-2 shot kill. Third, expand the headshot hitbox.\n\nOkay, now those frames I was talking about.\nMy computer is overkill when it comes to this. Specs: Processer-3.16ghz Graphics-Radeon HD7790. More than enough? Yes. Soo, why am I getting choppy frames? I can play Battlefield 3 at 60FPS on Ultra, and this simple graphical game can only run at 30 fps avg with 10 fps frame drops? C'mon... I think this should have stayed in Beta a bit longer to smooth out these problems.\n\nI wouldn't advise buying this game until a patch comes in because you'll just end up screaming and throwing your mouse at the wall.\n\nBut it is a fun game, just really, really, broken!","September 15, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

All in all, these things tend to blend together quite well. Collecting resources to create new weapons is not difficult, and is better than grinding for XP to get a decent weapon. Even beginners can score kills and points really early on, and learning how to play is quick.\n\nPros:\nNot too grindy crafting system, countered by the fact you may only need to craft a select few items you want\nGreat aesthetic\nGreat models (Armor + weapons)\nFun gameplay\nBeginners can get into the game quickly + easily\nNeat armor system to buff, and consequently, debuff stats\n\nCons:\nNo music in-game apart from when titants are moving. Makes the game feel empty\nOnly 2 gamemodes. Cannot choose a specific one, they must be shuffled\nLimited number of maps\nKatana fights are boiled down to "Spam click and spin mouse until you kill your opponent"\nDisconnecting from the host is far too common, resulting in a return to the main menu","June 24, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The lighting detail and particle detail seems to be most of the strain, the detail of these alone can't be changed.\n\nYou can't fine tune the video settings much. The only detail settings are culling, texture, world, and shadow. There's also the normal resolution, and vsync settings.\n\nLag is an issue in the game.

(Don't listen to those who complain melee is too overpowered, it is very easy to counter with the right weaponry and with enough practice)\n\nCon's:\n*The inventory whipe kind of killed it for me, I had spent a long time obtaining my items and while they said that they made all cosmetics/items craftable, some of my favourites are actually not craftable, such as the harvest sickles and the pumpkin grenades.\n*Australian's may have a hard time playing as the player hosted servers can get quite lag, but its usually not unbearable.\n*Last I checked the co-op survival mode, I believe it was called Horde mode or something, was currently not working, which sucks because it used to be very fun.\n\n\nWhile the cons I've listed may seem to outweigh the pro's, this is really not the case. Minimum is a very fun game and I can't wait till it's completely restored to its former glory :)\n\nMinimum was one of my favourite games.\nHowever I would not recommend buying it (not that you can) in it's current state due to:\n\n#1 (This is the most important issue) The servers have been down for what seems like an eternity, you cannot actually play the game should you buy it![/b]\n\n#2 Prior to the server issues the new developers did not release that much new content. They redid some maps and released a couple new maps, but didn't add any new weapons or armour. (Not that the old developer were any better, as prior to the new developers taking ownership of the game they had not released anything new for quite some time). The last content update I remember was an april fools joke! When they added an invisible weapon and armour (the promo for said armour looked awesome, shame they didn't just make that armour)\n\n#3 Prior to the server issues the community was very small. Quite often you'd end up being put on a server with bots rather than one of the few servers with people on them. This was not always the case, as the community used to be huge before the old devs stopped making new content.\n\nMinimum was an amazing game and should they fix all the problems and actually bring the servers back online and start releasing new content (it would be a lot easier if they just hosted directly through steam like some other games) then go ahead and buy it, you won't regret it. But sadly it doesn't look like that time is coming any time soon :(\n\nThankyou for reading my review!","January 21","true","24.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

My friends and I picked it up over the steam summer sale while looking for some simple games we could play together. We found the matchmaking to be buggy, but still fun.\n\nThe main mechanic of the game involves you picking up powerups that drop from killed enemy's that upgrade your weapons up to 3 times, giving them more damage/new mechanics, as well as collecting materials to craft/upgrade armor sets. Powerups are lost on death but armor remains.\n\nIt has 3 game modes: Team Deathmatch, Horde mode, and a mode called Titan, where both teams try to escort a giant robot into the enemy base to destroy a power core. We mostly just played Titan mode, and had a fun time.\n\nThere are some pretty cool weapons like mine launchers and laser rifles, though some of them are imbalanced*Cough*Bouncechaingun*Cough*, meaning someone like me (Completely average at best) can stomp even people who are much higher skill level. Some, like the Cryo Sniper, are so weak/Hard to use that it makes it difficult to complete quests that require kills with that weapon.\n\nThere was an issue with rubberbanding, sometimes the servers lag out a little bit and makes everyone jump around, but it only happened maybe once a match, if that. The matchmaking as a group is a mess. Sometimes the group leader gets into a game while everyone else is stuck in a lobby, sometimes invites would not bring you into the group, and it seems the game won't put you on the same team if you have more than 3 players in your group.\n\nTLDR: Fun, but buggy. Play it, if you don't mind dealing with bugs","June 14, 2015","true","16.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It mixes third-person shooters with light MOBA elements in an elegant, action focused way. It’s well paced, and I find that matches tend to go back-and-forth; it's pretty rare to get completely steam-rolled.\n\nHaving to pick between killing off the enemy Titan, defending your Titan, farming creeps, choosing when to craft, or going in for kills to power-up your attacks makes each game feel pretty fresh. The lighting and particle effects are gorgeous. There's tons of loving details on each of the maps, like everyone has unique Titans, a cool visual theme and a something that differentiates itself gameplay-wise from the others.\n\nI think the texture-less style looks great in motion. Since they don't have to worry about loading textures, they go over the top with the Enlighten engine and detailed, blocky particle effects. Despite being built out of squares, there's really lot of style in the maps, weapons and armor.","November 28, 2014","true","21.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

This is not a Titanfall-like gamemode because of the name. It's more like a Dota or League of Legends-like game that you have to slain creeps that are are placed on the map, to gain points and to make your Titan (a giant robot walking to the next Titan to destroy him) stronger... I think... Anyways, if your Titan kills the other Titan of the enemy team, he will be able to destroy the enemy's walls and eventually the other team's core, nexus, thing... I dunno. And like any shooter, you kill real people! Yay!

So now, let's talk about the game in general:\nIt's a third person shooter, graphics are nice, at least the art style, the game is very original (I think), you can create loadouts and unlock weapons by buying blueprints which you use to craft weapons with materials that you earn by winning (or loosing) a match, combat is really fast-paced which remembers me of Unreal Turnament, loading times are minimum (haha get it?) and I have a lot to tell you about this game but I'm kinda tired so...

And it's only in early access, it will only get better from here. The gameplay is rewarding, it rewards good players in that with every kill you level up your gun, up to level five, and can craft armor that has unique attributes with each set. You get new weapons by unlocking a schematic then getting enough material to forge it. Armor is crafted in-game and is only there for that match, you start off with no armor but them as you get more material by playing the objective you can craft armor and then level that armor up to three, with most sets, which gives the game a great sense of progression and that you constantly have to keep up with your character. To me this game has great possibilites and I am happy to get this game while it's still in developement to see how it progresses and would recommend this game to anyone who wants a fun game whilst being competitive and cooperative.","May 13, 2014","true","9.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So incredibly boring. The variety of the weapons and the level design is so low you've pretty much seen it all within an hour of playing.\n\nThis game is not fairThere's this idiotic system where kills upgrade your weapon, but dying resets it. This means the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. While I enjoy a good hunt on a player who's topping the charts, it should be about skill - not whoever gets the lucky first kill. Once someone gets ahead, the rest of his team picks up the spoils for his kills and get equally beefy. This means the match is pretty much decided by this point. Armor stays between lives, but most of the options are more of a trade-off than a downright improvement like the weapon upgrades.\n\nYou need a pretty beefy machine to run thisDo not be fooled by the game's lack of textures and low polygon count; your system will struggle like a moped trying to haul an elephant, and the fact that the elephant appears to be wearing a corset doesn't help very much. Even the main menu isn't smooth. I run a Radeon 7670M for a graphics card, which is not much but enough to run most games at low to medium settings smoothly. It can run Far Cry 3 no problem. But this game... even with everything set to minimum (including turning shadows off completely and running at a lower resolution), this game STILL didn't hit the stable 60 FPS mark. 30 FPS may be fine for some games, but this game is very twitchy; not to the extend of, say, Doom, but twitchy enough you're at a disadvantage running at anything below stable 60 FPS.\n\nIt isn't finishedEven the tutorial text says features are still missing. Besides, there's plenty of bugs. I often got a second aiming reticule drawn on screen and was unable to get rid of it, leaving me to guess as to which one was the one which actually indicated where my bullets will go. If the match starts while you're in the menus it'll force you back to the main menu. Energy cores often disappear when titans hit them. The news on the main menu displays 'Lorem ipsum' text while it loads. When you select 'titan' as the game mode and hit the server browser, it'll take you to a shoddy webpage and show you all game modes anyway. Oh, and there's no server names or ping display, making it very likely you'll pick a server halfway across the world with terrible lag.\n\nSome minor annoyancesThe game's own account system which the unnecessary password restrictions (it needs to contain at least 7 characters which one capital letter and one number). The keyboard input lag when entering said password. The unexplained glow on the titans when they first spawn (I'm assuming this means they're invulnerable at that time). Stats on the weapons (damage, firerate, etc.) are nowhere to be found, making your guess as to which weapon to unlock next as good as any. The sheer number of different pick-ups that all look the same, especially in the heat of the moment. Nowhere is it explained that health regenerates (it becomes apparent pretty fast, but I'd sooner associate making someone glow with a power-up, not being low on health). Aim assist and mouse smoothing are on by default. The giant hitboxes on titans, making it impossible to shoot enemies behind them. The jerky animations on the titans. The ledges that look like you don't have to jump over them, but you do. There's no hit indicator on the titan. You get the point. I also find the 3rd person view very cumbersome on a twitchy shooter like this, but that may be personal.\n\nConclusionsNope. Don't get this. Save your money. Even if you can stand all the aforementioned problems, the gameplay really isn't that good. There's only so many weapons and they're all slight variations on a simple sniper, shotgun, launcher, or sword. The levels are all very similar. Games are decided way too quickly. It's simply boring. The idea with the titans and the creeps is interesting (though nothing new), but the execution is just abysmal. If you're looking for an FPS with a little bit of MOBA mixed in (like I was), Titanfall really does the whole creep thing a lot better, and you can actually pilot the titans in that game. If you want the big titan to protect and move forward, Team Fortress 2's cart mode is vastly superior (not to mention free and runs like a dream on old hardware).\n\nNothing to see here, move along.","January 7, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Actually its not a bad game, don't let the cover judge the book. but it has its share of flaws. Down below I will list up all the things I noticed through our game session with friends. But first.\n\nPros / Cons Just a quickie..\n\nPros.\nGreat concept. [The Titan gamemode in this case]\nInteresting game styles.\nFast paced action.\nMinimalism done right.\nTeamwork needed to win.\nCrafting and Market mechanism.\nAwesome visuals.\nThat oughta' summed up the game.\n\nCons\nThe actions sometimes become unpredictable. [eg. Cutting people for an hour and dont die]\nLag spikes and low framerate on 4+cores and 4gb ram\nHitboxes for objects too big. [Sentry, Titans ... Can't move away beside them]\nIf playing in a party, It mostly never gives you the same team. Happens with 3+ people.\nI got this game for 5€ in the Team Pack for me and my friends, And we didn't /entirely/ regret getting the game, But it is good, Because it packs enough adrenaline it pulls you back to play more until you eventually tire out. It has badass swordplays, Sick gunfights and OP sniper shooting ranges. Like mentioned, The only setback is the lack of optimalisation. Even for a game with such low graphics can lag hard on good computers such as mine or my friends'. It kinda ruins the fun, But surely makes up later in-game. In overall, Buy the game to support the developers. It has room for development.\n\nI'd say: 7/10.

So incredibly boring. The variety of the weapons and the level design is so low you've pretty much seen it all within an hour of playing.\n\nThis game is not fairThere's this idiotic system where kills upgrade your weapon, but dying resets it. This means the rich get richer and the poor stay poor. While I enjoy a good hunt on a player who's topping the charts, it should be about skill - not whoever gets the lucky first kill. Once someone gets ahead, the rest of his team picks up the spoils for his kills and get equally beefy. This means the match is pretty much decided by this point. Armor stays between lives, but most of the options are more of a trade-off than a downright improvement like the weapon upgrades.\n\nYou need a pretty beefy machine to run thisDo not be fooled by the game's lack of textures and low polygon count; your system will struggle like a moped trying to haul an elephant, and the fact that the elephant appears to be wearing a corset doesn't help very much. Even the main menu isn't smooth. I run a Radeon 7670M for a graphics card, which is not much but enough to run most games at low to medium settings smoothly. It can run Far Cry 3 no problem. But this game... even with everything set to minimum (including turning shadows off completely and running at a lower resolution), this game STILL didn't hit the stable 60 FPS mark. 30 FPS may be fine for some games, but this game is very twitchy; not to the extend of, say, Doom, but twitchy enough you're at a disadvantage running at anything below stable 60 FPS.\n\nIt isn't finishedEven the tutorial text says features are still missing. Besides, there's plenty of bugs. I often got a second aiming reticule drawn on screen and was unable to get rid of it, leaving me to guess as to which one was the one which actually indicated where my bullets will go. If the match starts while you're in the menus it'll force you back to the main menu. Energy cores often disappear when titans hit them. The news on the main menu displays 'Lorem ipsum' text while it loads. When you select 'titan' as the game mode and hit the server browser, it'll take you to a shoddy webpage and show you all game modes anyway. Oh, and there's no server names or ping display, making it very likely you'll pick a server halfway across the world with terrible lag.\n\nSome minor annoyancesThe game's own account system which the unnecessary password restrictions (it needs to contain at least 7 characters which one capital letter and one number). The keyboard input lag when entering said password. The unexplained glow on the titans when they first spawn (I'm assuming this means they're invulnerable at that time).

The sheer number of different pick-ups that all look the same, especially in the heat of the moment.

The ledges that look like you don't have to jump over them, but you do. There's no hit indicator on the titan. You get the point. I also find the 3rd person view very cumbersome on a twitchy shooter like this, but that may be personal.\n\nConclusionsNope. Don't get this. Save your money.

The game used to be owned by Atari, if I am not mistaken, and Atari decided to stop funding it. Suddenly a few people start giving it a thumbs down saying that the game is dead and it wont come back. Yet the developers found another company willing to help fund it, and now the game is back up and running, the problem being that when most of it's previous players found out that the game "shut down" they didn't bother checking if it came back.\n\ni'll be honest giving a game thumbs down or saying it is bad because it has a low player base is wrong, the devs didn't implement that into their game, it should simply be a warning sing. Now the question is, is it good?\n♥♥♥♥ YEAH IT'S GOOD\nThe game allows the player to literally play their way, by allowing them to customize their loadouts with multiple guns and swords to choose, and armor sets with different stats and models. It has a quake feeling to it because of the crazy gun play, but third person. The concept for the game is creative and pretty original for one game mode, that being Titan Mode which is the most played, you have to kill these creeps and collect titan power up to make your titan more powerful, players will fight for the creeps, specially the golden creep which gives the titan a power up.  the other 2 game modes are survival (Horde) and Team Deathmatch. The game does have a lot a space for skill gameplay, it may seem sometimes very casual, but when you play the game you realize it requires more skill than it seems.\n\nThe only bad thing about this game is that it feels oddly optimized, when I'm in the menu it drops to 10 Fps but in game I have 30 Fps, thing is that I have ran heavier games and they run at 40-60 fps. Crashed very little time and the game has never gotten stuck on me. Other than that the game is fine.","May 21","true","14.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The crafting is easy and fun and the stuff you can craft so far is awesome. The stuff you can see we'll be able to craft eventually is really exciting.\n\nThe hit detection feels a tiny bit off sometimes but overall it's a very smooth experience for an Early Access Beta.\n\nThe snowball effect from getting killstreaks is both fun and not really imbalanced (I hate snowball effects in games). You die, you lose the weapon upgrades.\n\nPS- For anyone who decides to play, make sure to use blueprints in a match.

Everything is subject to change. Serious balance changes are needed.\n\nMinimum is a game that i've been anticipating for a while, it's a neat concept, it has unique gameplay, and the gameplay is fluid.\nIt has tons of problems though.\nAs of right now, melee is absolutely overpowered, it's hard to get a single match without some spaz running around chopping everybody on the other team to pieces.\nSpeaking of teams, the matchmaking & balancing is also really terrible. Numerous times i've been on the receiving end of a 1v4, or worse. There is absolutely nothing that can be done if you're by yourself, unless everyone on the other team is braindead or afk, or if you're going hard with melee & speed.\nTons of balance changes need to be made, an example would be with the different armors. Most of the armor sets are hardly viable at all, and the rest are incredibly situational...Except for the berzerker set. Because you can't change your armor once you've applied it, there is never any reason to go with anything other than the berzerker set. It scales the best with levels, and is usable with ANY weapon. Don't get me wrong, some pieces like the Icarus chestplate are useful, it gives a nice increase to melee protection. The only problem is that it's as previously mentioned, very situational, and the movement penalty cancels itself out when you can't get away from a melee user.\n\nSorry for the wall of text, and hopefully this game's future will be brighter.","May 10, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
