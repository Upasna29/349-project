Playing on normal, if you walk into something too hard and lose your entire army, you get to keep the army anyway and the poor men collect some gold for you to reinforce so you can try again.\n\nIt's entertaining enough for €4, but not much more. I'd say buy it if you're bored, like this type of games and want something new. Not a must have in the game collection by any means.","March 17, 2014","true","2.6"," 59 of 67 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","59","67","0","2"

It's hard to know what to say about it. It is not a bad game. I'm tempted to call it good. But I'm not going to do that, and I wouldn't recommend it to people.\n\nAt $4.99, Braveland seems reasonably priced. On sale, it might even sound like a steal. But you're going to get a few hours out of it, and there's nothing remarkable about those few hours.\n\nThere's nothing really awful about Braveland. The graphics are slightly unnervingly Fisher Price, but they're effective and the backgrounds look nice. There are only a few songs, and they sound competent and appropriate. The interface is fine. The mechanics are... well, balanced and kind of standard for this kind of game.\n\nSo what's the problem?\n\nThere's not much depth to the battles, and there's not much to it besides battles. You pick up a modest variety of classes, and can bring up to five with you: archers, healers, knights, scouts, etc. Their roles are fairly obvious and they do them well enough. But you can really use whatever combination you want, and the gameplay won't change much at all.\n\nThe story is... well, the dialog is spelled and formatted correctly and does tell a pretty straightforward story about soldiers, bandits, villagers and the like. No one really says anything very interesting, but the conversations are short and inoffensive. The most personality you get out of the game is that bandits are dime-a-dozen jerks, and your peasant friend is a bit of a coward. There's a hero, who doesn't actually fight, and annoys me a little to look at him strutting around the world map as though he's helping. Technically he provides stat bonuses to the rest of the team by leveling up, but he mostly just speaks for the team and collects power-ups.\n\nThere's no real replay value to the campaign, but there's a Survival mode where you can play battle to battle, losing characters and buying new ones, and see how far you get. I played around with it a little, and it might add a bit of life to the game if you wind up loving it. So, there's a bit of hope for getting more play out of the game at least.\n\nI have played a lot of Flash games in my days, on sites like Newgrounds - RPGs, tower defense, strategy games, action, etc.. Braveland feels very much like one of those games. The look, the feel, the length, the design choices and the options the player is given. Indeed, I feel like I've played Bravelands many times already. Except usually, when I play this kind of game, it's free. Often, it's also got something more novel or fun about it.\n\nNormally, it's probably not good to get lost in the weeds talking about free vs. paid gaming in a review like this. I guess all I'm saying is, Bravelands is a dime a dozen kind of game that you see all over the internet, and even if it's got a bit of polish and isn't awful, it's hard for me to justify anyone spending their money on it. For a few dollars more, there are lots of really unique, memorable games on Steam.\n\nIf you just want to blow through some clean and simple RPG battles for a few hours, you probably won't hate this game. If it looks like it might be really awesome, it's not. It's just not. Look at the other reviews. A lot of the positive reviews say that it's short, it's easy, there's not a lot to it, it would be good for kids, etc.. Hardly ringing endorsements. If this game were getting 1 to 10 ratings instead of Yes or No, I don't imagine they'd be all that high. Nobody really loves this game. Everyone just agrees it's okay. If you want an okay game, buy Bravelands.","May 17, 2015","false","4.8"," 76 of 94 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","76","94","0","2"

Something like a mix of Heroes and a fairy tale.\nI enjoyed playing it, but unfortunately there are some minor problems.\n\nFirst of all, the game has absolutely no replay value. 5 hours is enough to beat the game on hard level of difficulty.\nAfter that you don't really need nor want to play it again.\n\nSecondly, there are limited amount of fights, so leveling system is really poorly made. Same with gold, you just can't farm and earn as much coins as you would like. For example, there is achievement to buy all skills for your units. I noticed that achievement just before the last fight with 500 gold on me. Last upgrade costs something like 1500 gold. So i had to sell one of my equipment to achieve it. Pretty stupid, isn't it?\n\nAnother problem is with AI. Computer doesn't really know what strategy means. For example it does not protect ranged units and is trying to kill my healer first, even if it would last for ever.\n\nAnd well, there are not many units available unfortunately. Also absence of Dragons makes me sad :(\n\nAnyway, it is a cheerfull game which will give you fun. The price is not so high also, but i would suggest waiting for a promotion or get it in bundle.","April 2, 2015","true","9.9"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","0"

If you  are new to the genre then this is a game to get you started.

Or perhaps King's Bounty or Age of Wonders? Stripped of all city management, you basically just have the turn-based combat. Braveland takes this and adds a big, friendly smile on every creature.\n\nIt presents you a cute, classic storyline: a happy farmer boy loses his family and farm to bandits and sets out on a bold journey for revenge, but it turns out there is something more sinister going on and the happy guy wants to deal with it. He travels around and beats up the bad guys who take the hits with permanent crooked smiles on their faces. At first the dialogue attemps some meme-based humour (arrow in the knee anyone?), but they are quickly discarded for cheerful, repetitive greetings and taunts.\n\nTravelling happens on a board with enemies, stores and events in each tile. It's linear, though you can (and should) check every branching road for bonus items, gold and experience points. Gold gets you more troops and items, experience gives small bonuses to creature stats and increases the cap on troops.\n\nWhile I only played the hard mode, combats are easy for a player familiar with turn-based strategy games. Combat AI does not offer surprises in neither good nor bad ways, so it's okay. There are only 7 different types of troops to buy and around the same number of different enemies with upgraded versions of the usual ones coming later into the game. Basically all of them also smile all the time.\n\nWhy, I even lost one battle! Being vastly out-numbered, my troops collected their pocket money and gave it to me to hire more troops for another try. Happyland would have been a more appropriate name for the game.\n\nIn conclusion, Braveland would probably be a nice introduction to turn-based strategy games for children or people not acquainted with the genre. For the rest of us it's just a small snack (it lasted ~4 hours for me) that gets a dusty taste towards the end. Get it on sale.","December 12, 2014","true","4.3"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","19","29","2","0"

It's a good game to play in half hour intervals. It also provides a solid 5-7 hours of gameplay. I'd say that's a plus for the pricetag.\n\nThe game's battle system isn't very deep and it's clearly designed for casual players. Despite this, it manages to throw heavy (yet short-term) consequences for playing badly on hard mode. The game has a small element of resource management wherein the more efficient you play, the more money you get to keep. If for example you play terribly on hard mode, you'll end up earning less gold (you'll have to pay more to replenish your party). The battles are finite so you can see how this can affect you. Luckily there's a way to earn gold in case you mess up. Be warned though that the other method is pretty boring.\n\nI went in expecting a casual experience and that's exactly what I got. The only thing I can really complain about is that window mode was not part of the option menu.\n\n4/5.

You have a overhead map you move around on going from point to point. Each point either has an enemy, friendly, store, or treasure.\n\nYou can buy and find or buy gear to increase your attacks, and defenses. You will also earn specials that can be released after being hit so many times. Each special costs a different amount and can be pretty helpful at times. As you progress through the map you will come across friendlies who will join up with you. You'll get help from knights, archers, and healers for example.\n\nWhen building a team for battles they give you a point system. Each unit stack costs a certain amount and your max points to use is 15. So for example farmers costs 2 points per stack and archers are 3. Then after leveling up your main character you will be allowed to recruit more people per unit stack. This way when you go into battle you would have like 15 farmers per stack, 10 archers per stack, and so on. Enemies may only take some damage or may wipe out a few people from the stack. After each battle you are given exp points and gold. Then if you lost people you get charged a certain amount to revive them.\n\nI played the game on easy considering I have a ton of games to play and really want to clear out some backllog.

Fairly basic tactics and quite repetetive but it's fairly brief and it warranted getting to the end. There's a little scope for varying your army build, you basically get 15 points with each unit type being worth from 1 to 5, and there being 7 units to choose from once you've unlocked them all. Over the course of the game as you level up you can purchase extra forces, and basic items that improve your skills. Again this is very simplified and you may as well just buy the most expensive (i.e. best) stuff. I found the heaviest tank unit to be woefully underpowered compared to the crossbow unit, especially with the power up triple shot action that the crossbow guys have, and the tank is also very slow, and can be tricky to position to get the best from his power up skill of attacking all surrounding hexes.\n\nI'm pointing out what could be considered flaws here but I did enjoy playing it, and it was never intended to be a heavy thinking game anyway. The quick battles are neat and the constant stream of new stuff being just a few minutes away keeps you interested.

There is a bonus given for losing battles to encourage players to never give up.  Healers are more effective as offensive casters.  There is all the sheer basics that make up a TBS, but nothing more.  If you are a beginner, or you want to introduce your children in to the genre, or you really want a game that is easy to max out achievements on, give it a shot.  If you are looking for a solid challenge, you're simply not going to find it here.\n\nEdit: Since my last review, I decided to play it all the way through in all the different modes.  Hard mode wasn't much different than normal, but did offer a little more boosted enemy AI.  Failure still pays out.  Survivor mode was actually a fair challenge.  Unit death is real, and you have to buy units between battles.  This gets tricky, as they only offer specific units for sale between each battle.  This makes healers imperative, but also puts a huge target on their head.  The longer you last, the bigger bonus they will give you next time around.  Survivor mode also cuts out all role play, which speeds up the game drastically.  Even with survivor mode, the game simply isn't as tough as the Heroes of Might & Magic series, which I would recommend to those who found this game too easy.","July 3, 2014","true","8.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It introduces all the basic concepts of positioning and knowing how each unit interacts with one another while remaining simple enough to master inside of ten minutes. Being something of a TRPG snob from "back in the day", I find the game to be refreshingly easy, even on the hard difficulty.\n\nThe graphics are a colorful and fun hand drawn style that helps mark the game as somewhat laid back. The story, while simple, touches on many of the overarching themes found in more complex titles and does so in about five hours, which is well worth the $5 price tag.

Well, at least regarding the mechanics of the game.\n\nYou can buy different kinds of units (melee, ranged, magic) with both basic and special attacks, and you have to fight lots of ennemis on a map with hexagonal cells. Winning a fight will give you money and experience. With the gold, you can buy units and pieces of equipments for your hero : they will boost your entire team and grant them special bonus.\nThere is a total of 7 different units, and you have a restriction of 5 different units per battle plus no more than 15 stars total (best units are 5 stars, so you can't have 5 different units if you want the best ones).\nYour hero have some special powers that can be activated with Fury (not sure about the name in English since I played in French) : you will get this ressource if one of your unit is getting hurt by an ennemy. You can equip up to four pieces of equipment : an armor, a weapon, a hat and a belt.\nBut sadly, that's it : compared to the same kind of games (HoMM or even King's Bounty), there is nothing more in terms of gameplay. Sure, this game may have been created aiming at specific people, but it looks a little bit too simplified.\n\nGraphics are the kind I like, so that's great for me. But there is not that much content : you have to choose between 3 difficulties at the beginning of the campaign (Easy, Normal, Difficult), and you can adjust it while playing the game (not during a fight, just between them). I did complete the campaign mode firstly on Easy then on Difficult : each time, it took me only 3 hours to defeat the final boss, clearing all of the ennemies on the global map. There's also the Survival mode (you have to survive 10 fights), but that's it.\nIf you've already played this kind of games, I suggest that you might just go on Difficult mode from the beginning, because it's not even that hard. Moreover, you'll be able to unlock 100% of the achievements within one walkthrough.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell, if you are looking for a HoMM-like game that is easy to complete within an afternoon (3 hours for the campaign, no matter which difficulty you choose), I guess that's a fine choice. The current price (4,99€) seems a little bit high, but if you can get it in a bundle, well, it should be okay.","November 7, 2014","true","6.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'm an hour into this game and wondering where the main hero is in every battle that I fight. It's like he tells everybody to go fight and he'll be right there. Except he never shows up. Then he comes back with all these cool buffs he found from leveling and not fighting. He's really awesome. I hope he grows some balls soon instead of hiding in the bushes while everybody else fights. Because then he would be the hero Braveland deserves, but not the one it needs right now.\n\nBecause then he'd actually be brave...in the land of Braveland.\n\nAll that being said, I think implementing an actual cover system with overwatch would easily place this game in the $10 range. Since it's $5 or less on sale, it's worth a look. Here's hoping that these same creative devs can add just a little more spice to an otherwise great game.\n\nIncrease difficulty. Main character. Use cover/overwatch. Instant 3 points.\n\n6/10","June 20, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is fresh (at the time of this review, I think it said a month old). It's art is simple and easy to get into. The gameplay is simple, not hard, and can be kind of quick. The story is a bit hard to follow, and I found myself just skipping dialogue. But it wasn't too bad of a game. I'd recommend Braveland to someone who wants a small game to play for fun.\n\nHope they come out with Book 2 (or more) soon.","July 11, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the price, length, and style, it really is a fun little game.  I'm playing on a Mac, so there are a few glitches I encountered (don't know if this is true for other OSes), none of which were deal-breakers and a few other minor irritations:\n\n1) For some reason, out of the blue usually, you can't do anything-- move, click on anything, close the game. . .  Like the forums say, an easy fix is switching the game to beta.  Worked like a charm after that.\n2) Despite doing some things in-game (like the rain of fire, 100 troops), the achievements didn't unlock.\n3) The game ends rather abrubtly.  I suppose if I'd paid attention, I would have realized I was at the end.  I think part of that is because there really isn't a huge emphasis on the game's story or story development.\n4) I'm not sure if it was just me, but the battle for the sword in the stone seemed far more difficult than any other battle in the game.\n\nBut, like I mentioned before, these really are just minor issues.  I was actually a little sad when I got to the end and definitely hope the developers continue/expand the saga.","March 22, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I just skip those lol. (2/10)\n\nGameplay: Unlike the aspect of the story, the gameplay itself is enjoyable for a turn-based strategy game.  (8/10)\n\n1- Character Elements -\n@You can view each character's information which include: health, damage, defence , range of movement and number of turns. There is also a description of character abilities and what it's capable of (stunning/magic damage/healing etc)\n@Level System: You level up by getting exp (obviously) by defeating and winning enemies.\n@Main Character: You buy more units or upgrades with the coins you get, you can't upgrade your units and however, you cannot fight with your main character (you only fight with your 'squad' aka your units)\n\n2- Combat-\nThe combat is fun and easy. You get tips in the start of the game to understand the basics, and then you will just get used to the combat and know what to do.\nThere are some points however, where you will have to move forward and fight weaker enemies instead of trying to beat an overwhelming enemy squad because your squad is not strong enough (which makes the game challenging.)\n\nGameplay Styles: (5/10)\n3 Difficulties (Set to Easy/Normal/Hard)\nEasy is too easy , Normal is challenging enough and Hard oh well, it's for those of you who want to hit your head in the computer in order to win each match even if you have for example 5 units and your enemies have 500.\n\nEnjoyment: the game is fun for a regular and basic turn based game, I recommend it (it's not have so many\nhours of gameplay either so it's just for fun for your free time) - (4/5)\n\nRepeatable: Didn't finish the game yet, but it's one of those turn-based games which the difficulty is the only thing that will change your gameplay. (1.5/5)\n\nFrustration: Except for extremely unexpected challenging enemies (bosses with 300 health and 2 units of it) the game is fluent and you will feel like a god playing with your super talented squad. - (2/5)\n\nBoredom: You will play this game for few hours without breaks. (1/5)\n","May 23, 2015","true","14.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Braveland was developed for Windows, Linux, OS X, iOS and Android. The game is set-up in a very mobile friendly way.

The main hero can not be taken into battle, but you can outfit him with armor and weapons to boost your teams stats. The soundtrack is superb and art direction reminds me of some of 5th cells games.

The main difference is that it automatically subtracts a small fee from the reward for winning a battle to replace units that were lost.  So you only need to head back to buy more units if you are below your leadership cap.  Units have a star ranking, which limits which units you can use together, which is only noticible close to the end of the game with one unit that it effectively prevents you from using.  You could remove two units to make room for this one, but it's not an even trade.  There is also a survival mode, where you have to beat 10 combats in a row, it's not hard to beat, and there is llittle reason to continue playing it once you have beat both modes.  This game was on the short side, but it was fun while it lasted.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysocks/recommended/285800/","mysocks","Valex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mysocks/","1137 products in account","The line between 'flash/casual game' and 'real game' is a blurred one, but Braveland clearly favors the first category.\n\nTaking 'King's Bounty' style tactical combat and party-building, Braveland simplifies the formula to its most basic components, and then presents it in a simple, colorful, node-based design.\n\n\nPROS\n* Easy to pick-up, play for a couple minutes, and put down.\n* Art style is simple, but appealing in its colorfulness\n* Very stable, didn't notice any bugs or issues\n\n*If you're looking for a palate cleanser between heavier fare, a mindless but well-presented time-killer, or an introduction to strategy games, this game is ideal.\n\n\nNEUTRAL\n* Very easy. Anyone with prior strategy experience ought be able to manage the hardest difficulty with no problems- in fact, even if you do suffer a lost battle, you suffer no penalties and get extra gold for your efforts.\n\n* Very short. This game won't take you more than 5 hours for a full run-through, and you can likely manage it in 3 if you're motivated.\n\n* There's a few 'wait till you're strong enough' side paths, but the game is essentially entirely linear.\n\n* Minimal character building (just straight stat level-ups that end up not being overly significant) and swapping army formation is incredibly limited due to a mix of limited unit selection and limited army building points.\n\n* Weird dialogue blurbs. This game has no story worth mentioning, but the developers did implement a basic plotline, with occasional npc dialogues. And each one of those comes across as an oddly mistranslated garble.\n\n* By its very nature of being a casual stripped down version of meatier titles, the game doesn't offer anything new to the genre.\n\n* Game has a survival mode that benefits from being able to offer characters from the subsequent games, but really doesn't offer much reason to play it past initial novelty.\n\n\nCONS\n\n* The interface is often clunky and underdeveloped, making things more of a hassle than it ought be [or than is usual for more modern games in the genre]. And sometimes trying to get info on a game component isn't near as simple a matter as it ought be.\n\n* If you're looking for a strategy game of any depth, involvement, complexity, challenge, or a game with any story elements, this is not the game for you.\n\n\n\n\nSummary:\nIf you go into this with the same mindset as playing a game of minesweeper, solitaire, etc, the game is quite enjoyable- and while it won't leave any lasting impression on you, it's a nice way to burn time when you've got no energy for anything too involved, or only have a few minutes to kill.\n\nIf you go into this with the mindset of a typical strategy gamer, you're going to be itching to use that steam refund option.\n\nCasual Game perspective: 3.5/5\nStrategy Game perspective: 2/5","November 22, 2015","true","10.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

If you're experienced with these type of games the tutorial is painfully slow anyhow as the mechanics of this game is not different enough from most other games like it to make it necessary to explain the combat and workings of the game in detail to anyone but the less experienced players. Also the combat doesn't really change much hence it's not very replayable and to be honest i didn't find even the hardest difficulty noticably more challenging than normal (didn't try easy).\nStill. If it's on sale it is a good time once you get past the tutorial and start playing the game.\n\nPro:\n- Charming graphics\n- Easily learned battle mechanics that, although somewhat easy, still can throw you if you don't get rid of the right enemy first (as an example: leaving the poison dealing archers till last while dealing with a slow moving, heavy hitting boss may make you lose the battle). These should however be things that come naturally to more experienced players.\n- Good balance of difficulty throughout the game as the middle part is not the most difficult part of the game as in so many other games.\n- Choices matter - chances are you will not earn enough gold to focus both on having a full army, all skills unlocked AND all the best equipment, you may have to choose unless you're insanely good at not taking damage and healing your own units (the gold won from each battle depends on how many of your units died).\n- Some resemblence of a storyline throughout the game despite the fact that it's a small one that took me only a few hours to play through. The current time on my profile is two playthroughs, and the second was much shorter than the first. Although it's generic and has the almost clichéd throwback that most RPGs have where you - upon beating your sworn arch enemy - realize that who you that who was portrayed at the main villain was just someone's pawn afterall aaaand you have to defeat them to. And their armies. And their pets. And their wife. Possibly. Also sully the honour of their daughter in in the nude.. waitwhat. No. Nevermind.\n\nCons:\n- Music got really annoying to me (granted, i find myself unable to listen to game music most of the time).\n- The different difficulty settings were really not that different to me.\n- You're forced to play through the tutorial as it's integrated in the story of the game (First three moves or so on the map).\n- Not really challenging at all, even on the hardest difficulty.\n(- For the achievement junkies like myself: you have to check out their twitter online in order to obtain all achievements. What the h*** is that about? For someone who doesn't even have a twitter account that was just a nuisance. In fact. It'd probably be a nuisance even if I did have an account.)\n\nConclusion: See summary (top of the post).","January 1, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have a (very) small set of units to play with, you only get one of each type, and you can't bring them all into the same battle.  The melee units are all on the same spectrum, with fast, weak units on one end and slow, strong units on the other.  The ranged units are similar, and it seems like the designers went out of their way to make the game completely balanced so that there are no wrong choices.\n\nWhich means there are no right choices either; nothing you do deployment-wise or unit management-wise has any real effect on the battles.  I suppose you could decide to intentionally damage your chances (ie: not buying/equipping new items, not upgrading when you have the option), but there's no advantage to be had by making that choice.  So, for each choice you're presented with in the game, either all answers are equivalent (and therefore it doesn't matter what you decide) or one answer is clearly better than the others (at which point, why even ask the player?).\n\nCombat itself, the heart of the game, is similarly weak. There's no real tactical or strategic interest in the battle system. Melee characters bash things in the next hex, ranged characters are weak against melee, but can hit any hex on the map. There's no cover or line of sight, so there's nowhere to hide from the ranged units.  There's no zone of control, so there's no preventing the melee units from running straight up to the ranged units and pounding on them. None of the hexes has any intrinsic value (other than the occasional chest, of which I think there were two in the entire game?), so you almost never need to be anywhere in particular on the map.\n\nSo really, it's just a brawl in an empty parking lot.  Over and over.\n\nThere are some special abilities (one per unit), but there's no tradeoff for using them.  The crossbowman, for instance, gets a super shot.  He has to sacrifice a turn to use it, but does triple damage the next round. There is no reason not to use this power every time it comes available; the enemies aren't variable enough to make it worth banking (especially since there are no reinforcements), and it means that in two turns you do three turns worth of damage.  It's simply more effective than just using the regular attack.\n\nThere's a global set of spells you can cast any time, but you accrue spell points by your units taking hits, so you can't really contrive to earn them more quickly.  They come in at the rate they come in, and you can spend them on (by the end) one of five spells.  Two of which are "hit enemy" and "hit random enemies", one of which makes a unit faster, and two of which I can't remember because I never needed them and they weren't interesting enough to try.  So, much like the unit powers, the spells wind up being an attack you get to throw for free once in a while. There's never a good reason not to do so when you have the chance.\n\nA total absence of interesting choices (tactically, strategically, plot-wise...) is the defining experience of the game.  With some minor changes to combat (ZOC!  How did they manage to make a hexmap game without zone of control?  What were they thinking?  And where are the tradeoffs for the specials?  Why isn't your hero on the field somewhere?) it could be really good, but as it stands it's weak and unsatisfying.\n","March 17, 2015","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically, it is a short, kind, may be somewhat naive, fairy tale with not over-complicated tactical battles.\n\nIt took me just three evenings to complete the game, and it doesn't make much sense to replay it as I played on the hard difficulty, and although there is a survival mode as well, the core game is just a one-time trip, during which one sees pretty much everything of it. Even though the game can't be technically called absolutely linear, there is not much real freedom of exploration or choice.\n\nI really liked the cute and positive art style (think HoMM1/2), although I would say that the interface is somewhat coarse and make one think about casual/mobile games. Oh, wait... it is a casual mobile game, after all.\nThe story (which is presented via short dialogues) is simple and not particularly deep, but exactly suits the general style of the game.\n\nThe global map reminds me of Puzzle Quest, where you travel between fixed points, to fight a fight or/and get the next piece of story, which is a fine format for me.\nThe tactical battles can be obviously described like HoMM-lite, and it is clear, that the encounters were designed so that they don't last more than few minutes. Some might like it, yet some might find them lacking complexity and depth. But again, the game does not pretend to be hardcore strategic. Having said that, certain design choices are still rather strange, +1% troop defense for a hero attribute point, seriously?(you hardly have 10 by the end of the game, so, basically, neither your hero's 'build', nor equipment really matters).\n\nSo, to sum up, Braveland offers an enjoyable relaxed experience for some 6 hours, maybe little more.

When this title is on sale, it is about the same price as the normal price for the mobile version.\n2) No PC optimizations: #1 would be ok if the developers actually put effort into the port, but as it stands there are little to no improvements. There are very basic features that the game lacks due to lack of will/laziness. One example is that you cannot find out the movement zone of enemy units - in typical strategy games you mouseover a unit to see how far it can move so you can stay outside the range, in this game, you need to look up its movement, and manually count squares. You cannot 'mouseover' on a phone, so why implement it on a PC? Right?\n3) Lack of strategy: This game, despite being a strategy game, has almost no strategy. The two small figments of strategy is that most enemies have only one counter, so double teaming them saves one counter hit; also, you can block enemies with your troops to prevent them attacking your back line. Staples such as combo attacks are non-existent. So most battles are just a slapfest where your troops and enemy troops will stand toe to toe slugging it out until one stack dies.\n\nBottom line: Maybe acceptable for a kid, but for anyone who likes the strategic aspect, Braveland is a pass.","October 19, 2015","false","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/recommended/285800/","KafroHudrep","Kafro Hudrep","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KafroHudrep/","352 products in account","Braveland is a casual strategy RPG which follows the incredibly standard plot of Dude's Village Is Pillaged -> Go Revenge It. I'm going to start off by saying that I played through the entire story campaign on Hard Mode; I recommend doing this because it feels like the best way to get a decent challenge out of this game.\n\nCombat in the game takes place as turn-based tactical skirmishes on small hexagonal battlefields, with a particular emphasis on troops. That is to say, each character on the battlefield is actually made up of multiple people of the same class, with their stats stacking on top of each other. As these troops take damage and lose bodies, so too do their stats dwindle, similar to Advance Wars, and probably a lot of other games I haven't played because I am a huge scrub. This creates an interesting dynamic where it's not always the correct option to focus damage on one enemy troop at a time, but rather spread damage out enough to make enemy attacks feeble rather than fatal. Additionally, there's a long-term concern in the form of gold: You have to pay a penalty out of your gold reward at the end of combat to recover lost allies, and there's no way to grind for extra gold, so keeping losses to a minimum is paramount.\n\nProgression is semi-linear. You go across a three-region map from skirmish to skirmish, picking up new allies and abilities along the way. There are short side paths to turn onto which end with treasure, stat upgrades, and shops to purchase additional units for troops as well as equipment to put on your main character — who inexplicably, despite being a warrior's son and built like such, doesn't have any actual presence in battle, instead preferring to radiate his stats onto his troops from the sidelines I guess. The early game can be pretty brutal due to the lack of troops and gold to enhance them with, though this gradually becomes less of an issue as income outpaces expenses. It isn't exactly clear how the stats on your main character affect your troops either, so to be honest I just didn't bother with equips until the best were available for purchase. Upgrading troops directly seems to be the best use of money anyhow — a massive clump of one-star Peasants can be surprisingly effective!\n\nGraphically, the game is colorful and the environments are nice enough to look at, though the character models are a bit too reminiscent of a high school Flash animation for my taste. On the other hand, the music, while inoffensive, only consists of two tracks: The one used for travel and the one used for combat. Not even the final boss gets a different song, which I found quite disappointing.\n\nOverall, Braveland was an enjoyable experience for a rather unassuming casual title. The campaign lasted around 4-5 hours for me to clear it 100%, which is a decent length for the $2 it tends to go for on sale. There's also a Survival mode where you just play battles and spend gold on upgrades in-between, which to be frank I didn't bother with too much.\n\nUnfortunately, I've heard that the sequel, Braveland Wizard, adds the ability to grind for gold and apparently makes it feel necessary to do. Kind of ruins the need for strategic planning at that point.","January 1","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You will have different unit stacks (7 types), areas to recruit more, a hero that levels (Max of about 10), and equipment (4 different slots).

When this title is on sale, it is about the same price as the normal price for the mobile version.\n2) No PC optimizations: #1 would be ok if the developers actually put effort into the port, but as it stands there are little to no improvements. There are very basic features that the game lacks due to lack of will/laziness. One example is that you cannot find out the movement zone of enemy units - in typical strategy games you mouseover a unit to see how far it can move so you can stay outside the range, in this game, you need to look up its movement, and manually count squares. You cannot 'mouseover' on a phone, so why implement it on a PC? Right?\n3) Lack of strategy: This game, despite being a strategy game, has almost no strategy. The two small figments of strategy is that most enemies have only one counter, so double teaming them saves one counter hit; also, you can block enemies with your troops to prevent them attacking your back line. Staples such as combo attacks are non-existent. So most battles are just a slapfest where your troops and enemy troops will stand toe to toe slugging it out until one stack dies.\n\nBottom line: Maybe acceptable for a kid, but for anyone who likes the strategic aspect, Braveland is a pass.","October 19, 2015","false","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cute cartoonish graphics with a turn-based strategy system, it is very very basic and also repetitive but the short story makes time fly by before you get bored. However the survival mode is really tough to reach battle 10 and seems like a RNG battle, no matter how skillful you are you cant seem to win it with the wrong units given.

Also there is no information at all in survival, e.g. how much physical resist you have or physical damage.\n\nPros:\n- Simple\n- Not too long\n- Addictive\n- Hard on insane\n\nCons:\n- Limited information given.\n- "Story"\n- No depth\n- Survival Mode impossible\n\nTL;DR: If you are looking for a simple game to play for a day I recommend this game, it will keep your mind captivated on the game and time flies by.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kobirds/recommended/285800/","kobirds","King of Birds","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kobirds/","111 products in account","Giriş:\nBraveland, Tortuga Team isimli bağımsız bir yapımcı tarafından geliştirilip, yayınlanmış basit bir Tur bazlı causal bir strateji oyunu olarak karşımıza çıkıyor. Oyun oynanış bakımından Ubisoft'un ünlü serisi Heroes of Might and Magic serisini andırsa da bağımsız bir yapımcının ilk adımı olduğundan doğal olarak basite indirgenmiş ve özellik bakımından zayıf kalıp birçok eksikliği içinde barındırıyor.\n\nTema: (Spoiler içermez.)\nOyunda hikaye bize sen diliyle anlatılıyor yani biz herkesin huzur ve barış içinde yaşadığı bir köyde büyümüş bir genç oluyoruz bu durumda. Sonra birden azgın haydutlar geliyor ve köyümüze saldırıyor. Ahırlarımızı yağmalıyor ve direnen herkesi kılıçtan geçirip karanlığa karışıyorlar ancak biz savaşmadan kadere boyun eğecek bir genç olmadığımızdan babamızın eski zırhını giyip haydutların izini sürmeye doğru ilerliyoruz. Doğuya doğru haydutları kovalarken 7 adet köylü de savaşmak için bize katılınca hikayemiz başlıyor ve yolumuz boyunca ormandaki kurtlardan tutun da büyücülere kadar bir çok düşmanla savaşmak zorunda kalıyoruz.\n\nOyunun Güçlü Yanları:\n+ Her şeyden önce ucuz bir oyun olması kesinlikle güçlü olmasa bile iyi bir yanı.\n+ Hardcore oyunculuktan sıkılmış biraz casual takılmak isteyen Singleplayer oyuncular için kısa ama güzel bir kaçamak.\n+ Kontroller 7 yaşında bir çocuğun oynayabileceği kadar basit ancak oyunu zor modunda bitirmek belki biraz daha komplike düşünmeyi gerektirebilir.\n+ Oyun boyunca ben hiçbir bug veya glitch ile karşılaşmadım. Zannediyorum ki oyun hatalardan arındırılmış.\n\nOyunun Zayıf Yanları:\n- Oyunun hikayesi kesinlikle çok kısa ve herhangi bir şekilde tekrarlanabilirliği yok.\n- Oyunda doğru düzgün birlik seçme veya onları yön vererek geliştirmek gibi bir şansımız yokki bu da stratejik olanakları kısıtlıyor.\n- Aynı zamanda güçlü yanı olarak da belirtsem de oyun bazı oyuncular için can sıkıcı olabilecek derecede basit.\n- Karakterler arası diyaloglar da kesinlikle oyunun daha çocuk gruba hitap ettiğini hissettiriyor.\n- Savaş sayısı da kısıtlı olduğundan exp veya altın farmlamak gibi bir şansınızın da olmaması üzücü.\n\nSonuç:\nBraveland, bağımsız bir yapımcının oyun dünyasına ilk atılışı ve kesinlikle başarısız bir yapım değil. Ancak başarılı hiç değil. Tur bazlı strateji oyunlarına giriş yapmak isteyen birisi için basit sistemleri öğretici ve bir fikir üretici bir oyun olabilir. Eğer 7 yaşında bir kardeşiniz varsa güzel vakit geçirmesi için alabileceğiniz bir oyun olabilir ancak gerçekten bir oyuncunun 4-6 saatini vermesini hak edecek ne hikayesi ne de oynanışı var. Eğer gerçekten Tur bazlı strateji oyunlarını seven biriyseniz başka oyunlara bakabilir veya bu oyunu güzel bir mobil alternatif olarak telefonunuza indirebilirsiniz.\n\nDeğer mi?:\nBraveland, bana kalırsa ucuz olmasına rağmen bu kadar kısa oynanış süresiyle tam ücretini kesinlikle hak etmeyen bir oyun ancak indirimdeyken alırsanız hem bu bağımsız yapımcıları desteklemiş hem de oyunu pişman olmayacağınız kadar ucuz bir ücrete getirmiş oluyorsunuz.\n\nSon Notlar:\nBenim Braveland'i alma sebebim HoMM'u kaldıramayacak bir bilgisayarım varken inanılmaz derecede HoMM oynamak istememdi. Oyunu aldım ve yükleyip oynadıktan sonra HoMM oynama hevesimi biraz da olsa kırmış olurken aynı zamanda koleksiyon kartlarını ve Steam başarılarını da alıp oyunu sildim. Çok bir beklentiniz olmadan oynarsanız zevk alacağınız bir oyun çünkü zaten 4-6 saat kadar kısa bir sürede bitiyor hem de oyun insanı sıkmıyor. Kolay akıyor anlayacağınız.","May 22","false","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
