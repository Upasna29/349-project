Written in flash, so almost no issue playing in Windows system as it's installed in most of the machines.\n\nGame's a bit short, about one hour and almost no interaction except pressing buttons to proceed through dialogues and collect key items. There's no violence and gore or adult material, feel free to play together with family.\n\nWhat's interesting for this game is that it brings some moral lessons along with the story. Not anything revolutionary, but still good.\n\nWith free price tag, no harm in picking this up and finishing it, even if you're not a fan of VN.

As every day went on I felt as if I was Cantus and I felt the sorrows and smiles that he was expressing through his own thoughts and projecting to Maris.\nIt made me stop and think about my own life and really made me just... open my eyes and come to a sudden realisation what my father does for me. I don't notice much but he does a lot just like Cantus's mother.\n\nAs the story got to the end so did my emotions and thoughts about the game. I absolutely loved every single bit of this game and I am officially hooked onto this genre.\nThat being said I cried in the last scene, it was so beautiful and made me smile at the same time when Cantus finally cried and smiled for his mother and appreciated everything she did for him growing up to the present. It was the perfect ending to a story.\n\nI highly recommend this game to ANYONE that has a spare hour of their lives as I'm sure it will be an hour well spent.","April 8, 2015","true","1.0"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","15","16","0","3"

Cantus is a moody teenager with no friends, but that all changes when he meets Maris, the cheerful, always happy and playful girl by the sea.\n\nCantus reguarly visits the beach alone, until he finds Maris, who pops up out of nowhere. Maris sparks Cantus' feelings and breaks him out of his emotional shell, his sea shell :3.\n\nThis is a quite smaller visual novel than most, but it has a short, but sweet story.\n\nThe art of the game is truly stunning in comparison to most free-to-play novels, which really makes this game appeal to me as the audience. The music is very cute and suits the corresponding part of the story very well.\n\nThis story should never be spoilt, as the ending will truly break your heart. I was definitely touched, and just had to play through again. There are only very few characters, which leaves lots of time to connect with each and everyone, may it be; Cantus, Maris or Cantus' Mother.\n\nI enjoyed this game very much and appreciated every single bit of it.\nI would rate this 10/10, but as of now, there is no sequel, so a 9.5/10 will have to do.\n\nDefinitely install this game, as it is truly, life changing.","January 25","true","6.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","1"

She introduces herself as Maris, they continue to talk. Cantus doesnt understand why this girl is talking to him but he allows her intrusion into his closed world, by the end of this meeting Maris makes Cantus a promise, that she will make Cantus smile.\n\nAs far as the story is concerned Voices from the Sea is a Slice of Life / Drama Visual Novel with a somewhat mysterious tone to it, having bought the game instead of just getting the free version I received the experience the creator had originally envisioned.\n\nAnd wow it is something, this story was so interesting to me that I reread the whole VN several times when I first got it, Im not sure if this will be the same for everyone but it really made me think.\n\nSound wise the music is outstanding the use of music is great and complements both the story and the overall feel of the VN. The only grievance is ultimately the voice acting, and this is understandable and easily forgiven as your drawn into the lives of the characters.\n\nThe Art I find to be very well done and not just the characters, the backgrounds too are visually appealing, the style of the VN is typical anime art, but that is usually what you can expect with a Visual Novel, however somehow and I cant really put it into words, Voices from the Seaeven though yes it uses the same style as many other VN's it defines itself and stands out from the crowd.\n\nVoices from the Sea is a very character-focused VN, length wise it is not the longest I have come across, but it doesn't need to be; it tells its story well in the period of time needed, any longer and the feel would be completely off, as if to make it worse by drawing it out so though some will be disappointed at its short length it is for the best.\n\nOverall Voices from the Sea is beautifully written piece of work; It is visually appealing, the characters are interesting, Cantus's journey is worth investing in, as is finding out more about the mysterious girl Maris.\n\nI'll leave you with this, Voices from the Sea  is a great read and will no doubt keep you interested throughout its duration, and its absolutely free if that's not a good reason to check it out I don't know what is....so Why not give it a try and if you enjoy it I would highly recommend getting Voices from the Sea Plus.\n\n(Like all my reviews I do not put a score as it is my belief that games like all forms of art are subjective and therefore it is impossible to afix a number to them)","April 12","true","50.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

The game was made using Adobe Flash Player and clocks in at around 30 minutes to an hour to beat depending on your reading speed, but trust me when I say it is an hour well spent. My review will be covering the Standard Edition which features no voice work, however, there is a Plus Edition that is fully voiced that I would be very interested in checking it out at a later date.\n\nVoices from the Sea's story had me intrigued from the moment I started to the moment I finished with an unexpected plot twist at the end that was emotionally touching. The dialogue is wonderfully written and the characters are interesting enough to keep you entertained. The soundtrack didn't have many tracks, but the tracks that were there were gorgeously composed with each one playing on cue right when you would expect them. The art style is your pretty typical anime-style, but it does just enough to set itself apart from the rest of the crowd with a little twist that I personally enjoyed more than some of the other Visuals Novels out now.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend Voices from the Sea whether you are a long time fan of Visual Novels or if you are just getting into them for the first time.

He sits around at the beach listening to the waves, when suddenly a girl shows up. She is rather excentric and clings to Cantus. She will be his first friend and make him happy.\n\nThe story and plot are short but wonderfully done. While you can pretty much guess the outcome (specially as it is quite a linear story), it is fun to read. It's funny and also a little sad at some points.\nThe characters are also nicely done with the girl being quite random and Cantus being quite silent/serious.\n\nThe graphics/art style are nicely done, though don't change much, as there is only 1 setting and a few characters.\nStill, they are drawn really nicely and the backgrounds are nicely animated as well.\n\nThe music has the same problem as the graphics. They are wonderful to listen to and really set the mood of the story and characters but there are around 3 songs in total.\n\nVerdict: If you want to read a visual novel with a good story, fun characters in a nicely drawn fashion, this is really for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayasays/recommended/348620/","sayasays","Not FUNKe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sayasays/","60 products in account","[SUMMARY]\n\nYet another one of those “games” that just doesn’t get the light of day, but it is truly fantastic. Free to play, quick download, and a quick “game” to work through, arguably one of the best “games” I’ve picked up in the last few weeks. Highly recommend you give this game a go, a truly enthralling tale 8.5/10\n\n[IN-DEPTH REVIEW]\nSo, you are one of those people that is just not sold by my summary? Alright, here is a nice in-depth evaluation.\n\nOddly enough, I found myself searching through the free to play list on Steam, and sorted by popularity. I found this “game” surprising low, despite how truly amazing it is, for a game of this genre, it is truly great at what it aims to achieve. All that being said let’s get onto actually talking about the game, shall we?\n\nFirst on my checklist is the storyline. The “game” being a visual novel means that it has to excel in that format, otherwise it is counter-intuitive, and that would be by no means good, would it now? The storyline itself is interesting, and I, for one, can relate. Not to having voices of the sea, but the idea of trying to trap everyone and everything out. The storyline follows a boy by the name of Cantus, not a name I can personally relate to but, is a bit out there, and is part of the reason why I remember it, it isn’t your average Bob, Phil or Vladimir, and by definition makes us as the audience be interested towards the story, maybe in hope to find out the reason of this name. This boy, is distant from society, from people to the objects around him, however, his ears are open the moment he is by the beach, and has a weird thing about liking beaches. He says a little about how he loves the sounds of the waves and how the seashells let him bring the sea home. He then meets someone on the beach, Maris, a girl, who is “slightly” older and she aims to make him smile. The game happens over 7 days, and the prologue, and if you want to know more, you are going to have to play it yourself, I personally will not be the one spoiling it for you.\n\nPlayability, as you may have noticed this “game” is not really played, it is more of a “game” where you oversee someone. Because of this factor, the “game” is being viewed, but you do have to do somethings, but fear not, this is a pick-up and play, you don’t need the controls to know what to do, the visual novel is meant to be watched rather than flat out played, and plays out somewhat in the way similar to Sakura Beach (minus those “naughty” scenes) and those games, but the net end of the storyline is always there, as far as I know there are no other endings, but as a non-owner of the DLC I can’t vouch for that. But, like I said playability, it’s easy and not really a game you play.\n\nIn terms of re-playability, since it is a visual novel, it is the standard gap in between, you may watch/play it every now and again, due to the memorable parts of the story and/or general love for the game/novel. An unfortunate problem is that, since there is no other endings, as far as my knowledge extends, there are no new experiences to gather, this loses some of the re-playability in my opinion.\n\nThat leads me to my next point, my sole complaint, is that there are no other endings, it really dampened the experience for me visual novels need to have some kind of variation of some kind, otherwise it just gets dull, and the potential fun that lies in replaying a game/novel is lost, because there is nothing else to really experiment with. That being said, the endings isn’t bad, and in fact is quite a nice ending, and day 7 wraps everything up with a nice little bow, and works well for the storyline, but at the end of the day, there just isn’t a new experience to garner from this game, besides getting the DLC (I don’t know about you, but I can’t spend that much) the game kind of gets a slight staleness from playing it again, and could turn you to hate it.\n\nBugs? There are none, not that I can say, good work there Zeiva Inc.\n\nArguably my favourite part of this novel is the graphics. The graphics, are too good to be true for this novel. The amount of time that went into them is so noticeable, the game is so flowing the graphic just go well with the storyline, if I was told to conjure up what the characters looked like from personality alone, they would look something like that (a bit more rough around the edges, I'm no Picasso), due to this I want to give a congratulations to the team for some really good graphics. They fit the tag of Anime very nicely, and I can say with confidence, that this novel is an anime. The silhouettes are also very nicely made, and add up to the feel of the game and just help massively in encasing ourselves into the world of Cantus and Maris. The graphics are so nice, I still remember them at this very moment, and they are so picturesque that it is quite astonishing, they are truly impressive, and immersive, and I love it. Also, it is run using Adobe Flash Player? Why can’t all other flash games/novel look this nice, it just really goes to show just how impressive this game really is.\n\nThe grand finale, music, sound, that lovely bundle of fun, happiness and enjoyment. The music, is just heaven, no joke. It astounds me how great it is, and how it feels part of the storyline, and is not just thrown in just so the design team can say they did something. My word, the music just goes well with the game/novel, it plays a similar role to that of the graphics which lead to the immersion, which I discussed earlier, and is part of the reason why I just keep playing on, and then put the tab open while writing this, because it’s just so peaceful, laid-back and relaxing, and like I already stated the immersion is just there for me, and even you Luke (rumour has it a Star Wars film is coming out, got to appeal to those kind of people)!\n\nJust before I give my closing statement, I want to give a hearty congratulations to the developer on a great visual novel, and that I loved every single minute of my 60 minutes (could change) that I spend playing/watching this game/novel unfold, good work there Zeiva Inc.\n\nSo, to conclude, a heartfelt game full of passion, joy immersion and some great graphics and some catchy tunes alongside it. A truly great game, quite unique and a beautiful tale. If you are still not willing to give this game a go, then maybe you just don’t dig this kind of thing, maybe you are reading this on your phone, maybe you’re on holiday or maybe enjoying the end of school (well, for me) or getting in the Christmas spirit (it’s next week at this point in time), or perhaps you are off to Kazakhstan because, Kazakhstan is cool, no?\n\nSo, in a nutshell, good game, well played. Sorry for any mistakes, I’m not fluent English, if you have any questions, or want me to review a game, add me or drop a comment on this, or my profile. And on that bombshell…\nGoodnight! (maybe it’s morning or afternoon, I don’t use clocks, way too fancy).\n","December 18, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tigurus/recommended/348620/","Tigurus","Karoliner Tigurus, Aeons Torn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tigurus/","242 products in account","A really short but wonderful game.\n\nThe story is about a lonely boy called Cantus. He sits around at the beach listening to the waves, when suddenly a girl shows up. She is rather excentric and clings to Cantus. She will be his first friend and make him happy.\n\nThe story and plot are short but wonderfully done. While you can pretty much guess the outcome (specially as it is quite a linear story), it is fun to read. It's funny and also a little sad at some points.\nThe characters are also nicely done with the girl being quite random and Cantus being quite silent/serious.\n\nThe graphics/art style are nicely done, though don't change much, as there is only 1 setting and a few characters.\nStill, they are drawn really nicely and the backgrounds are nicely animated as well.\n\nThe music has the same problem as the graphics. They are wonderful to listen to and really set the mood of the story and characters but there are around 3 songs in total.\n\nVerdict: If you want to read a visual novel with a good story, fun characters in a nicely drawn fashion, this is really for you. While short, I reckon it would make you smile.","May 6, 2015","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/recommended/348620/","katobytes","KatoBytes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/katobytes/","87 products in account","Eh, theres not really much to say about this one. Really, there isn't... I think. Here we go: Snoozefest from the Sea\n\nMeet Cantus, a reclusive thirteen year old chap. For him, he perceives the motion of life as nothing but a drag, and everything that doesn't constitute remote significance to him is dismissed as "noise", and his only passion resides within the virtues of seashells. He refrains from having any unwarranted interactions with other people, even with his own Mom. Overall he views his life devoid of any happiness. What an ♥♥♥, because you know, God forbid the MC of a visual novel isn't a pretentious snob, right? To be frank, he is by far the most insufferable brat I have witnessed being shown in a game for a while. Though Cantus' views are relatable to some degree, players like me will not be able fathom how his character got past the scripting stage of development, as I sporadically pulled my hairs in frustration of his unimaginative demeanor in-game. During one decisive day in one of the beaches of our aquatic/tropical setting, he encounters the main plot device of this narrative, Maris. Over the course of a week, she tries to make Cantus' smile at least once with promises that she will do so, and maybe pry open the door of opportunity for him to be a more sociable person. One can consider Maris to be the polar opposite of Cantus, as her exuberant, loquacious nature proves so, and with that said the contrast between these two characters is perhaps the only redeemable aspect about this game other than the art, but practically anyone can construct and recognize contrast between two different entities, so this isn't all that special.\n\nThis narrative in general follows a very linear template. There are 7 days in this game, and for a good 5 or so the player/reader will find themselves following the format of having a momentary mischief with Maris, picking up one of the three seashells, sitting through MC's reminiscence of his early days, rinse and repeat. Perhaps the creators made this monotonous pattern with some sort of intention, but as a result of me being so dense as to not figure out why that is I will propose a certain notion: THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO GO THROUGH WITH THIS. It must take the most absurd   reasoning to so much as presume that your audience won't find this redundant. To cap things off, during Cantus' little reflection, the last few words of the day usually appear after the screen's fade to black. For that impact. It's as if the writers really wanted to impart some sort of idea to me by the end of each of these days, and I have no inhibitions to claim that these guys... tried way too hard.\n\nThis one isn't too much of an issue, but the choice-making features this game brings was also a let-down. There is no bad ending for making the wrong choice, but rather that other choice can only be made once, to add some extra dialogue, and should the player make that same choice again instead of commencing the daily search of seashells, the MC blatantly denies, DENIES your choice, holding you at an inextricable bind until you make the correct choice that proceeds the plot. It's silly, but at least the choices were there to be made, and honestly the game has the prospect of being worse if there were more than one route.\n\nIn the nitty-gritty of things, it is imperative that a story well expresses it's themes if it wants to have any creditable substance in any form. This is my biggest gripe with this game, as it fails to preserve it's themes of social isolation for the entire game. I wish not to adorn my review with long spoiler bars, so I'll keep it simple. What it does wrong it that it manages to ignore the entire emotional (I use this term lightly) drive of the game, and turns the entire quintessence of the plot on it's side by the end of the reading. This was something I witnessed in a more famous novel, Tomoyo After, and it nettles me to no end. To my interpretation, the entire main idea of the game was turned into a more concrete one just for the sake of players not screaming at their screens saying "WTF WAS THAT EDGY TRASH?".

Granted, this is both free and very short so there is little cost to you whether you end up liking it or not.\n\nThe most to like about this one is the art and the music, which evoke a calm and contemplative mood, and there are a good number of CGs for its short length. Unfortunately, however, it fails to capitalize on its almost surreal setting, as its other departments are painfully inadequate. It might be that the game has a very low development budget, and free VNs tend to not be as well-written as the ones you have to pay for, but even then, there are much better examples free VNs for PC out there, like the Narcissu series [Stage-nana 2005], or True Remembrance [Shiba Satomi 2006]. The characterizations, motivations and themes here are much too shallow and generic to be memorable, and there is almost no story or scenario to speak of, whereas in the other examples, while they may not necessarily be the pinnacle of writing, they are unique in their own way.\n\nIf we don't consider only free titles then you get phenomenal works like Ever17 [Kid 2002], Little Busters! [Key 2007], Symphonic Rain [Kogado 2004], White Album 2 complete [Leaf 2010]. I do realize that Zeiva (the developers) are an independent group, but they need to try harder to make a favourable impression or to distinguish themselves. For me at least, 'disappointing' best describes the experience.","May 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","0"

The tired trope of "serious boy's life changed by Manic Pixie Dream Girl" is not only here in full effect, but exacerbated by his treatment of women as an alien species: the girl is enchanting but incomprehensible and his mother is a nag. If you get feels from this game, I hope it serves as a wake up call rather than reinforcing ideas that harm yourself and the people around you. Your life doesn't have to be like the main character of this visual novel. It's not romantic to hate everyone, it's just sad and lonely. Manic Pixie Dream Girls aren't real.

Now listen, if you want something light and part-of-the-norm this is perfect for you. What I'm about to say may offend any new or older anime/VN fans.\n\n+ Visuals are quite nice, I'd thumbs up on that\n+ For me, setting up animations and VNs are quite difficult to pull off, and good ones are even harder to pull off. So I admire that Zeiva did some nice work on art and animation on this.\n\n- Generic storyline, loner main character meets over-optimistic girl and( while I may not have even gone into depth of the full game) something dramatic will probably happen in the end of the story. While I may not be able to pinpoint the ending, the outcomes are quite predictable.\n- Slow intro with around 30-1 min of just slow slides of intro.\n- The music is quite generic as well, Having listened to the music in VN and Anime for the past 3 years, the style of music is becoming more and more similar in key and style.","April 3, 2015","false","0.1"," 10 of 32 people (31%) found this review helpful","31","10","32","0","0"

The first option (like "Change the topic") should always be chosen, because 'collecting sea shells' is just a skip, since you are going to do it either way.\nA nice, lightly flowing story sometimes kind of confusing you, to strenghten the total impact of the story on you and maybe also your opinion about certain realtives of yours.\nReally well done, I recommend this highly.","April 29, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In two days I racked up over 900+ views! Yup that distracted.\n\nAmong the que was this game. I was thinking about getting into a vidual novel, but did not know what one, so I followed most of them. VOICES FROM THE SEA came up free, so I downloaded it and started it. For a moment, I thought my ADHD was going to steal my time away again, but something made me keep "clicking" and reading. Maybe it was because I could related to the boy in the story. Or maybe when I was his age, I wished something like this would have happened. Regardless of the reason, I blocked out the world, and kept reading.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I finished it. The last few minutes had me running for the tissue - as it was one of those rare(for me) moving stories - the emotional climax will hit you fast - the timing was perfect.  You didnt realize it was going to happen until it did. And even though, you might have suspected the ending, it was OK. It was just the way it was supposed to be.\n\nI was so glad this one was free, as it will definately make me take a look at some other visual novels.

I mean here you have this game that is comepletely free and has very positive reviews. On one hand you have a very cute story with very nice art and music, on the other hand though it's very short and it's story doesn't really make that much of an impact compared to other game stories I have came across.\n\nI will admit though that when I saw that this game was funded by Kickstarter I was very wierded out by this. For one thing people actually paid for this to be made? I mentioned that the art was good.... but all you have is small portraits of characters, backgrounds, and a bit of art. I don't think all that is worth 1, 2, $4,509! Now if this all went towards the DLC maybe that would make sense but I have not downloaded the DLC and I don't really plan on it either. What's worse is that if these guys would have waited they probably would have been able to make it easily with the Visual Novel Maker that just recently came out. They possibly could have made this game for about $15 (Or at least the free version, again no exposure to the DLC).\n\nBut I will admit that the game is in fact cute. I liked the story even though it was short and simple. I like the characters and the design they gave them, give me anything thaqt looks like an anime or looks cute and I'll be hooked on it, add free and you got me. The development of Cantis (The main character), while quick, was really good. The interaction between these two characters are really nice as well, Maris and Cantis really make a nice duo. If anything I would like to think of it as a nice slice of life 3 minute anime, like "I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying"..... OK bad example but it's the only one I could think of at the moment to compare it with.\n\nOverall nice game, but I don't think it deserves these 10/10 ratings, I'm thinking more of 7.8/10, maybe an 8/10.

This is the first VN game I've ever played and I want to play more VN's if their stories are as interesting as this.\n\nIn Voices from the Sea you are a young boy named Cantus, an anti-social kid who has problems with his mother and the people around him, and one day you meet a strange girl named Maris while on the beach and she becomes your friend. Maris wants to cheer Cantus up, so she vows to make him smile within seven days. Each day they have a different discussion and each day ends with you collecting a seashell and giving it to Maris.\n\nThe story is beautiful and I personally was able to connect with Cantus (due to the fact that I'm an anti-social as well and I'm only one year older than him, about to turn 15 in a month myself although my age is irelevent). The only qualm I have with it is that at the end of every day you have to collect a seashell, and I wish that there was more ways to interact with Maris. But other then that, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this to everyone. I hope you enjoy this game like I did.\nGame Time: 1 Hour.\nRating: 9.5/10\nDeserves an Anime or OVA series","April 11, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In two days I racked up over 900+ views! Yup that distracted.\n\nAmong the que was this game. I was thinking about getting into a vidual novel, but did not know what one, so I followed most of them. VOICES FROM THE SEA came up free, so I downloaded it and started it. For a moment, I thought my ADHD was going to steal my time away again, but something made me keep "clicking" and reading. Maybe it was because I could related to the boy in the story. Or maybe when I was his age, I wished something like this would have happened. Regardless of the reason, I blocked out the world, and kept reading.\n\nAfter a couple hours, I finished it. The last few minutes had me running for the tissue - as it was one of those rare(for me) moving stories - the emotional climax will hit you fast - the timing was perfect.  You didnt realize it was going to happen until it did. And even though, you might have suspected the ending, it was OK. It was just the way it was supposed to be.\n\nI was so glad this one was free, as it will definately make me take a look at some other visual novels. But I think I might savor the memory of this one for a bit, before I mash it with another story.\n\nWhile the gfx are colorful and "cute", the storyline, is very mature (in a matter of speaking), and not the typical visual novel - this one would be good for your children - to make them realize just what they REALLY have in life that is important.\n\nRead it today -\n\nps:\nbring a kleenex box too. :-)\n(-macho guys will need paper towels LOL)\n\n","April 12, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I mean here you have this game that is comepletely free and has very positive reviews. On one hand you have a very cute story with very nice art and music, on the other hand though it's very short and it's story doesn't really make that much of an impact compared to other game stories I have came across.\n\nI will admit though that when I saw that this game was funded by Kickstarter I was very wierded out by this. For one thing people actually paid for this to be made? I mentioned that the art was good.... but all you have is small portraits of characters, backgrounds, and a bit of art. I don't think all that is worth 1, 2, $4,509! Now if this all went towards the DLC maybe that would make sense but I have not downloaded the DLC and I don't really plan on it either. What's worse is that if these guys would have waited they probably would have been able to make it easily with the Visual Novel Maker that just recently came out. They possibly could have made this game for about $15 (Or at least the free version, again no exposure to the DLC).\n\nBut I will admit that the game is in fact cute. I liked the story even though it was short and simple. I like the characters and the design they gave them, give me anything thaqt looks like an anime or looks cute and I'll be hooked on it, add free and you got me. The development of Cantis (The main character), while quick, was really good. The interaction between these two characters are really nice as well, Maris and Cantis really make a nice duo. If anything I would like to think of it as a nice slice of life 3 minute anime, like "I Can't Understand What My Husband is Saying"..... OK bad example but it's the only one I could think of at the moment to compare it with.\n\nOverall nice game, but I don't think it deserves these 10/10 ratings, I'm thinking more of 7.8/10, maybe an 8/10. Like I said cute concept, too short of a game.","April 12, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the typical type of "Sim Date" game that'd you want to find; what with only having one option to with and barely making any decisions at all, but it's a really great game if you like the setup of sim date games and enjoy Anime-styled games with a heartwarming ending.\n\nNo complaints at all rather than wishing we'd have more choices to make within the game. I know it wasn't the main purpose but a good portion of it was just dialogue.

In fact, I have just started playing them. And I am glad I have with games like these.\n\nThis novel is not really long. I completed it in one hour. Also, this game is made in Flash (I did not know Steam accepted Flash games!) which makes you unable to use the Steam overlay and such. It is a free to play Visual Novel, so I guess it does not have to be that fancy,\n\nAs for the content of this game, I am glad that I have spent my time playing this game. The visuals are very good and the music is absolutely amazing. They both managed to create a very dreamy yet emotional atmosphere to the game.\nThe story and its moral is good. I think some people can relate more to it than others but it is worth playing for. I know how the main character is feeling at some points. That made it more interesting for me. By the way, if you have not always been so nice to your family, better give this novel a try.\n\nTL;DR: This game is good and does not take long to complete. It is free to play too.","April 14, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seems nice.\nI have no regrets.\n\nIn reality, this is a very short but lovely visual novel that can be completed in about an hour and a half, but my God you'll have so many feels for it, you'll wish it was longer (Mind you the extra unlockable content can add about another 30 minutes or so, but it's still very short nonetheless).\n\nThis is a very short and simple story of this kid named Cantus, and he's a bit of a black sheep because he likes to hang out by the ocean all the time and doesn't want to go off and play video games like any other 13-year-old. He's not exactly the fun-loving type or the talkative type either so he's not apart of a clique of friends to say the least. At first, I thought I'd hate him because he kinda seemed like a bratty loner trying to be emo. But then he slowly changes because he meets a girl named Maris. And Maris is very strange in comparison to Cantus because she is very chipper, cheerful, friendly, easy to get along with, you have no idea where she came from or why she's talking to Cantus, etc. As Cantus hangs out more with Maris, he begins to slowly be more friendly and opens up more. The two have the cutest moments and conversations due to their different personalities, which makes both characters lovable and fascinating to watch and listen to.\n\nOne thing I want to mention as well is the music. I think the whole reason why I put so much time into this visual novel is because of the music. It's so relaxing and soothing, and the tracks, while there isn't a lot of them, it's still a very good soundtrack and they all set the tone for every moment very well. The only gripe about it I can think of is that there's no transition to the music tracks, like no fade in or fade out when the tracks have to change. But that's just nit picking.\n\nThe next thing is the voice acting (Only available in the DLC). While not professional by any means, it's pretty decent. It's nothing groundbreaking but it won't urge you to stab your eardrums. One thing I will say about the voice acting is that when the characters have to be loud, the voice actors don't really shout or raise the volume that much. I understand if the visual novel is meant to be a bit quiet or subdued but there is a certain part of the game when Cantus gets very upset/fed up. When it comes time for a him to express this, he's not very loud about it. I'm not saying you need to be loud in order to vent frustration, but it would make more sense if this was the case since, given you've seen the story up to said point because it's very relatable.\nI also love how every time you get a new sea shell Maris and Cantus always have something different to say about the shell you pick which then branches off into a full conversation, and it all sounds and feels so natural. Except how Maris refers to herself in the third person. I thought I would hate that she did this, but I oddly didn't mind. I mean, Maris was already kinda strange so it makes sense that she would talk weird, but she's also really cute so it didn't really matter in the end. You kinda just accept it as a normal thing.\n\nNow I also want to say things about the art style. It's super cute and even very beautiful. I love the way these characters are drawn, and I also love how blue the sky and water always is. I especially like the last part of the game art-wise because of how the scenery changes.\n\nAlso included in the DLC is a gallery where you can unlock wallpapers to change the image of the title screen. There's also character images and small profiles, a music gallery to the soundtrack, a theatre which unlocks a 3 part little story, and 2 side stories that are both very nice to watch through. Both side stories are only about 10-20 minutes long.\n\nThis visual novel is adorable.\n\nOther than that, Voices from the Sea is an adorable visual novel. The writing is simple and lovely, and if someone can take a simple story and take you on emotional roller coaster in 2 hours, then you're a genius. Granted there's no serious decisions nor multiple endings, but it's still a nice experience.\nIt's just a short and sweet little story to watch if you want to take a break from any serious games or you don't want to do a whole lot of strategy or anything. If you're looking for a story to experience or if you can relate to family issues or school issues without anything heavy, then give it a try. You won't regret it.","June 24, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is quite short, but that's no problem since I played the free version.  The art is very pretty, the music fits nicely in, and the story itself is compelling despite its length.\n\nThis is a pure visual novel without multiple endings.  Although you do have some dialogue choices, they don't appear to impact the ending (at least in the free version).  I won't spoil the ending, but it was certainly worth it.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes a good story-driven VN as long as they don't mind the single-ending format.  I have not played the $4.99 DLC, but if it adds a decent amount of content, that could definitely be worth it.  I'll be keeping an eye on it to possibly purchase later.","June 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As each day passes, a mysterious girl named Maris will do her best to make you smile.\n\nThe game is very short, about an hour or so in length.  However, don't let this discourage you from playing it.  There is a great short story about family and friendship waiting to be told and maybe even a little self-realization may take place in the process.\n\nBottom line is that this is something you should definitely put the time into playing, it put a smile on my face, that's for sure.","August 10, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's heavily reliant on blue and white for most of its color scheme. Depending on your reading speed, you’re looking at a 40 to 60 minute experience.\n\nThe story has plenty of funny moments and goes for charm and sweetness when the characters aren’t being goofy. You can expect to be a bitter, lonely 13 year old male, at least in the beginning. I strongly suggest taking the dialogue choice that isn’t the seashell one first to maximize your experience since the latter is the critical path.\n\nYou can also expect a lot of seashells by the seashore. Multiple playthroughs will allow you to collect every single seashell if you desire them all.\n\nFinally, I want anime eyes.

I think the story is great and lot's of people who maybe had a rough childhood could relate to i know i'v been their. Plus i read that people said this isn't a visaul novel cause it had only one ending seariously not all visual novels have multiple endings this isn't a Tell Tale game. I think some people are missing the point of a visual novel. It's to tell a story however long or short... Read a book once in awhile. The game play does'nt matter, the only thing that matters to me in a Vn is the story and this one was short but sweet.\n\n\nI recommend this game to anyone who loves VN for their story rather than gameplay and multi endings and what not..\nI'f you want a VN with interaction go play Nekopara i hear those Neko girls really no how to give a happy ending...","October 29, 2015","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where do I even begin?\n\nIt's a rather short game. I completed the game within thirty minutes and I bet most people could do it faster. This is where it earns the first point of recommendation in that it's perfectly paced. It delivered it's story and let me connect with the characters (to an extent) in the span of that thirty minutes and I had no trouble being immersed in the story whatsoever.\n\nThe art is beautiful. It starts of quite dull but soon enough, I was exposed to bright colours and absoultely gorgeous art everywhere on my screen. Here it earns two more points, one for the art and the other for mainting a theme much darker than the colours used without any real problems.\n\nIt's got a great plot twist. You won't see this one coming, I certainly didn't (then again, I'm horrid at being a detective :P) and once again, it's perfectly paced and didn't overwhelm or underwhelm me in the least and thus it earns another point.\n\nYou can't help but relate to the characters. I know that the characters I met in the game have little in common with me but even so, I couldn't help but understand what they felt and not just sympathize but also empathize with them. By the end, I was as in love with the characters as I would be if I watched a season of an anime. The game doing this within thirty minutes scores it yet another point.\n\nIt's a rather short game. Yep, i made this point before, except I didn't. While it's paced amazingly, it's still a very short game. The plot could have been developed so much more and the game could easily have been a full length RPG. Speaking of the plot, it's a bit underwhelming. It could benefit greatly with more depth and complexity and a single plot twist, no matter how well presented it is, just isn't enough.\n\nThere are also a ton of features in the game that tricked me into thinking it's complex and full of things to do but alas, they're lying. The entire game was basically me clicking through as if I were reading a manga. Then again, that's not much of negative since that's how visual novel games are by default.\n\nIn conclusion, TL;DR - It's a beautiful game that's brilliantly paced with a great story that pulled a bit on the heart strings and left me with a craving for visual novel games that's yet to be satisfied. I'd recommend it to anyone with a bit of spare time as it takes very little time to complete and  it's really quite a great game! It doesn't take a serious time commitment and it relaxes you, telling you it's story. It's free too so there's really no reason for you to not give it a go!\n\nWell then, don't just sit there, go!","October 29, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game. Gods... I have so much to say about it. And it's all good things as well. So here goes nothing.\n\nAlrighty so first off, the art was amazing. From the characters, to the backgrounds, it all looked so nicely done. And I won't lie, I found it pretty cool how at first almost everyone was just a shadowy figure when it was before Cantus went down to the beach to relax. It was a nice detail. The cute little snowmen guys were also a lovely touch. They made me smile a lot and say stuff like "Aww look at how cute they are"\n\nNext up is the music, and boy did I love it. I found it very relaxing and it was honestly enjoyable to listen to. And most music in any visual novels don't catch my interest unlike in this game. Usually I just have my iTunes in the background. But when I heard the opening for this game, I honestly felt very relaxed and so I gave it a try, and I really liked it.\n\nNow the story. Oh Odin the story. It was so good! I loved how the characters interacted with each other. I found Maris' efforts to make Cantus happy the cutest thing ever. And the way Cantus reacted to Maris' attempts was also very cute. I also was not expecting the ending. Way too many feels. But... I liked it, they were the good kind of feels. Anyways, on a personal note, and like others have already said, I could connect to this on a personal level as well. Due to being bullied up until this year when I moved to Florida and stuff, it's just really understandable since Cantus wasn't liked by the students either. It also told me that by the end, you just have to grow up, move and, and remember that family will always be there for you until the end. My only complaint though is that I wished the main story was a little longer.\n\nSo yeah. Loved this game. 10/10 would reccomend to friends :)","September 23, 2015","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The difference is that this game is a bit longer - I completed it in about an hour.\n\nCantus (the 13 year old protagonist) is a character you either sympathise with or dislike. I disliked him in the beginning because of his anti-social (and ungrateful) way of looking at life. But I sympathised with him towards the end of the game.\n\nI think the artwork and music work well together. Since it's a kinetic novel: no matter what choices you make, you get the same ending.\n\nIt's difficult to write a review without spoiling the short story, so I'll let you try it for yourself.

It's heavily reliant on blue and white for most of its color scheme. Depending on your reading speed, you’re looking at a 40 to 60 minute experience.\n\nThe story has plenty of funny moments and goes for charm and sweetness when the characters aren’t being goofy. You can expect to be a bitter, lonely 13 year old male, at least in the beginning. I strongly suggest taking the dialogue choice that isn’t the seashell one first to maximize your experience since the latter is the critical path.\n\nYou can also expect a lot of seashells by the seashore. Multiple playthroughs will allow you to collect every single seashell if you desire them all.\n\nFinally, I want anime eyes.

Onto gameplay elements, classical visual-novel gameplay style, after reading a certain part of the story you will be given a choice which, funny enough one will always be to look for sea shells. The game is short, for me it took 90 minutes to complete it. Onto music, there are quite a few soundtracks, but each of them having a relaxing tone, almost making you drift to another world.\n\nAbout the story itself, the boy named Cantus, is the anti-social type, until he meets a strange, cute-looking girl, by the beach, at the place where he usually sits, named Maris. The story itself is very nice so I leave it for you to continue it.\n\nThe game comes in two versions, Free and Plus, the Plus one coming in the form of a DLC which you have to pay for. Plus introduces hidden wallpapers, a character, image and music gallery and voice-acting, and 2 side-stories\n\nAs a way to conclude, the game is worth playing as it will leave your mind thinking for a long time, even though the story is short, as an added bonus it's free so it's worth checking it out.

However, I do have to say that I was rather disappointed with this product.\nI did find the art to be rather well-done. However, it suffers in terms of story. The main player character was in a state of depression, but no real reason was given as to why. Not even a passing comment. The other characters weren't as good either (though the other main character was okay). I saw the ending coming from a mile away. By the in-game Day 2, the game pretty much confirmed the ending I had predicted ever since the first textbox.\nThe choices available in-game were rather limited and didn't impact much on the overall outcome. You only have the option of "positive" and "negative" and neither of those really changed anything aside from what is said in dialogue. The shell-collecting minigame is also rather lacking and shares the same issues raised above.\nI suppose I can't really complain much since I have a real lack of VN know-how and hey, y'know, it's free (with the exception of the DLC which just adds some stuff onto it). But its story needs some good improvement and I'm not willing to pay $5 for more story if I couldn't enjoy the main stuff first time around.","December 28, 2015","false","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Seems nice.\nI have no regrets.\n\nIn reality, this is a very short but lovely visual novel that can be completed in about an hour and a half, but my God you'll have so many feels for it, you'll wish it was longer (Mind you the extra unlockable content can add about another 30 minutes or so, but it's still very short nonetheless).\n\nThis is a very short and simple story of this kid named Cantus, and he's a bit of a black sheep because he likes to hang out by the ocean all the time and doesn't want to go off and play video games like any other 13-year-old. He's not exactly the fun-loving type or the talkative type either so he's not apart of a clique of friends to say the least. At first, I thought I'd hate him because he kinda seemed like a bratty loner trying to be emo. But then he slowly changes because he meets a girl named Maris. And Maris is very strange in comparison to Cantus because she is very chipper, cheerful, friendly, easy to get along with, you have no idea where she came from or why she's talking to Cantus, etc. As Cantus hangs out more with Maris, he begins to slowly be more friendly and opens up more. The two have the cutest moments and conversations due to their different personalities, which makes both characters lovable and fascinating to watch and listen to.\n\nOne thing I want to mention as well is the music. I think the whole reason why I put so much time into this visual novel is because of the music. It's so relaxing and soothing, and the tracks, while there isn't a lot of them, it's still a very good soundtrack and they all set the tone for every moment very well. The only gripe about it I can think of is that there's no transition to the music tracks, like no fade in or fade out when the tracks have to change. But that's just nit picking.\n\nThe next thing is the voice acting (Only available in the DLC). While not professional by any means, it's pretty decent. It's nothing groundbreaking but it won't urge you to stab your eardrums. One thing I will say about the voice acting is that when the characters have to be loud, the voice actors don't really shout or raise the volume that much. I understand if the visual novel is meant to be a bit quiet or subdued but there is a certain part of the game when Cantus gets very upset/fed up. When it comes time for a him to express this, he's not very loud about it. I'm not saying you need to be loud in order to vent frustration, but it would make more sense if this was the case since, given you've seen the story up to said point because it's very relatable.\nI also love how every time you get a new sea shell Maris and Cantus always have something different to say about the shell you pick which then branches off into a full conversation, and it all sounds and feels so natural. Except how Maris refers to herself in the third person. I thought I would hate that she did this, but I oddly didn't mind. I mean, Maris was already kinda strange so it makes sense that she would talk weird, but she's also really cute so it didn't really matter in the end. You kinda just accept it as a normal thing.\n\nNow I also want to say things about the art style. It's super cute and even very beautiful. I love the way these characters are drawn, and I also love how blue the sky and water always is. I especially like the last part of the game art-wise because of how the scenery changes.\n\nAlso included in the DLC is a gallery where you can unlock wallpapers to change the image of the title screen. There's also character images and small profiles, a music gallery to the soundtrack, a theatre which unlocks a 3 part little story, and 2 side stories that are both very nice to watch through. Both side stories are only about 10-20 minutes long.\n\nThis visual novel is adorable.\n\nOther than that, Voices from the Sea is an adorable visual novel. The writing is simple and lovely, and if someone can take a simple story and take you on emotional roller coaster in 2 hours, then you're a genius. Granted there's no serious decisions nor multiple endings, but it's still a nice experience.\nIt's just a short and sweet little story to watch if you want to take a break from any serious games or you don't want to do a whole lot of strategy or anything. If you're looking for a story to experience or if you can relate to family issues or school issues without anything heavy, then give it a try. You won't regret it.","June 24, 2015","true","11.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is quite short, but that's no problem since I played the free version.  The art is very pretty, the music fits nicely in, and the story itself is compelling despite its length.\n\nThis is a pure visual novel without multiple endings.  Although you do have some dialogue choices, they don't appear to impact the ending (at least in the free version).  I won't spoil the ending, but it was certainly worth it.\n\nI would recommend this for anyone who likes a good story-driven VN as long as they don't mind the single-ending format.  I have not played the $4.99 DLC, but if it adds a decent amount of content, that could definitely be worth it.  I'll be keeping an eye on it to possibly purchase later.","June 28, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Cantus, the main character, is your average "I never smile" character, and Maris, the mysterious girl by the ocean, wants to make him. She talks in the third person, and it's a bit tropish and annoying at first, but the artistic direction and masterful use of colors in every shot really overcomes the standard plot. Even though it barely clocks in at an hour, the tale really is quite incapsulating, and while the ending is predictable, a part of me finds that to be a good thing. It accomplishes what the ultimate goal was. It made me smile.\n\nFor a free game, the quality is ridiculous, so don't be afraid to support the developers. There is DLC that asks for a measley 5 bucks and adds voice overs and a few new scenarios. One of these days I might pick it up, because I really respect what they've done here. They hope you pay for it out of love for the game; pure good will. That's something we do not see enough of these days, so for that, I definitely thank them, and I'll be looking forward to whatever else they do next.","July 26, 2015","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
