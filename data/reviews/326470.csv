The game's inertia mechanic drives me insane, though I'd imagine it adds to the challenge as to when to stop dragging and when to pull back (I'm just not particularly good at it). You'll have obstacles to drag your planet through, and turning and changing the direction of the planet is something you'll have to do carefully unless you're good at it.\n\nJudging from the trailer, further on in the game, different mechanics are introduced and add more challenge to the game. It does a have a neat little feature that shows you your previous runs in that level as you're doing it again, in real time. You can also watch someone else's playthrough in comparsion to your own via the leader boards.\n\nI only played the tutorial levels, but I realized the game wasn't for me. It seems like it'd be great for speed runners or people who like trying to get the "best times" in such games. If you enjoy these concepts, then give the game a bash.\n\nI'm not reccomending it based on my own tastes, but I could see why some people would enjoy it.","November 4, 2014","true","2.6"," 28 of 40 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","28","40","2","8"

Essentially a puzzle game, you have to move the Earth through tight spaces, moving dead zones, and other traps. The game has online leaderboards and while each level is short, they keep you going since you want to get that better score.","November 6, 2014","true","10.0"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","11","19","0","0"

Not an entirely new or original situation to be fair, but not one commonly done with this genre.\n\nAnyways, the Earth is in danger of being microwaved by space radiation and it is up to you to steer the Earth to safety by bending space and time in a 2D environment stricken with a kind of gellatinous radioactive jelly often found in the back of student dorm refridgerators, which kindly creates neat little passageways for your suddenly mobile Earth to steer through, in 2D, to the safe zone of each level... in 2D.\n\nIf I seem hung up on the 2D aspect of this, it is for a good reason. Space is very infrequently represented well in 2D. Much in the same way I do not like 2D mining games, 2D space games need to have a LOT of fantastic gameplay to compensate for cutting out an entire dimension before I can begin to feel like I haven't been ripped off.\n\nSpace Warp does not have fantastic gameplay. It is what you would expect from the marble-maze genre (yes I made that up). It does it's job but the theme chosen, while only slightly more original than "get ball to hole", having a space theme with no real 3D or more exciting gameplay cripples the game a bit for me. There is some tight programming in there, the graphics are nice, it all works well and feels good, but there isn't much more here to offer non-fans of similar, casual bus games. So all-in-all, not for me, but recommended to try it if you enjoy maze games or are stuck on a 12 hour bus journey.","November 5, 2014","true","0.2"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","8","14","0","0"

For those who like Physics games, and those who like games that need quick reflexes, this combines the best of both worlds! Pretty much the point of the game is to get Earth to the goal, while navigating through space, by warping space. BUT, it's not that easy. There are objects which will slow you down, speed you up and many more. Good thing this game is filled with facts and is based on true facts, not made-up space stories.

A very nice game with a very balanced play with graphics that are simple. It's a simple game so simple graphics work. I like the gameplay but now I have a technial issue now. I'm off-line 98% of the time and Space Warp crashes on off-line mode. Plus side is it crashes when you finish a level and when you restart the game, you can play the next level just the same. Problem is... it crashes. Fix that glitch on off-line mode and I'd recommend this game again. If not... why should I recommend a game that crashes after every level?","December 15, 2015","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
