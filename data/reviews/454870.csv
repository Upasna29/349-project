It's an ok game, but... If you catch this on sale for a couple of bucks, I might recommend, but otherwise get KR.\n\n1. You max your towers before getting halfway through the game.\n2. In the mobile game you have to buy all characters except for your first. Here you unlock them as you go through the maps.\n3. When I try to move my character to a certain spot, sometimes he will run another direction trying to get there and never make it.\n4. When you upgrade a stat on your characters it does not show that you gained in that stat.\n\n\nOnly about just over halfway through the map, but that is what I see at the moment.","May 8","true","4.8"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","0"

I'm playing the PC version. The graphics are nice, and I enjoy the different types of regions. I also like how each hero has unique special abilities, which adds replay value for me.\n\nBut, this game has a few bugs. Sometimes, you can't see the enemies.  The turrets will be shoot these invisible enmeies, but invisible enemies makes playing on hard mode vastly more difficult. Also, sometimes the hero wont respond or will move in other directions than desired. Invisible enemies (bottom right): http://i2.photobucket.com/albums/y4/joy_be_thy_name/errormagicquest.jpg\n\nThere's also a couple non-gameplay things that irk me about this game: there's aren't any emale heros in the game and aside from the Lizard man hero, there are only white characters in the game. The archer turret is female, which is nice, but I'd like to see more diversity in future.\n\n\n","May 9","true","9.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"
