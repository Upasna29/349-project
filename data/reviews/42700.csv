Had a rough launch but Treyarch seems to be the only activision COD developer who cares about PC gaming; rolling out bug fixes quickly and including FOV slider.\n\nThis has true Dedicated server support and support of unranked modded servers. The community has very much diminished, and most of the lower latency NA servers are mostly Nuketown forever game types with almost no servers hosting DLC.\nBuying DLC for this is only justifiable if you desire to play the Zombies game mode; which is an absolute blast, especially with friends; going for those higher levels and finding all the easter eggs.\n\nMy favorite part of this COD is the gunplay. Trades in gunfights tend to go to the more skilled player rather than the player who sees the other first (like we see in newer COD titles).\n\nIn summary:\n\nPros:\nTwitch Shooter with skill oriented gun play\nTrue Dedicated Servers with Mod Support on unranked Servers\nZombies gametype with tons of replay\n\nCons:\n90 FPS Cap (Old Quake engine bugs when running over 120 FPS)\nLack of Eyefinity or Surround multi Display support (Flawless Widescreen or Widescreen fixer solves this)\nSmall Community\nNuketown everywhere\nNo point of buying DLC unless you like the zombies game type","November 25, 2013","true","91.1"," 201 of 225 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","201","225","0","0"

One of the last Best CoD's you can get.\nComplaints\n1. The price... $40 for almost a 5 year old game?!\n2. Connection issues: since it is a 5 year old game, the servers are starting to come down and have tons of problems with the connections..\n3.Can't play SOLO without a connection: When I want to try and get the high level of zombies I cannot because TreyArch makes the game *Always online*. Now just to be clear when you are on the STEAM page. It does not say anywhere that you MUST have an on-going connection to play the game.\n\nPostive comments\n1. Great community: I have never played with a CoD community who are "mature" than kids on the digusting consoles. Never really any complaints but if somebody did wine the server would tell you to "Stfu" xD\n2. Create a Class: It's not bad consider you can buy ANY of the equiment you want instead of unlocking all by killing everybody, plus they are some great snipers and assualt rifles.\n\nDo I reccomend this game? Yes and no. The reason I am keeping it as a negetive is the price and the server issues. I mean think about it? Advanced Warfare is about $60USDs and this game is about 40USDs. Not worth it completely because it is a 5 YEAR OLD GAME TreyArch. But anyways I would say about a 5/10 because online is good, once you get it to work, but again, this price needs to be lowered to $20USD instead of this price.\n\nThanks for reading...","January 26, 2015","false","6.1"," 418 of 522 people (80%) found this review helpful 35 people found this review funny","80","418","522","35","19"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/42700/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","With all the uncertainties surrounding the Activision/Infinity Ward debacle that took place back in March 2010, many pondered an inevitable fall from grace for the Call of Duty franchise. With Medal of Honor's impending preempt release, that speculation was still debatable. However, hardly anyone ever considered the opposite. Except for maybe those who were hard at work behind the doors at Treyarch. They were given an opportunity to prove to the naysayers of the Infinity Ward fan club that they could bring the franchise to bigger and better heights. Even with that skepticism, the team at Treyarch knew what was at stake and have made their point very clear.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops took a lot of risks by stepping away from the norm, particularly in terms of storytelling. Players primarily take the role of Alex Mason, a man who is being held captive and interrogated for information concerning the Ascension Group. A seemingly random sequence of numbers is being broadcast at an unknown location, and his captors believe he has the answers to unravel their mystery. It's hard to speak too much on the plot's topic without giving away any spoilers, but I will say this; their new formula was a huge success.\n\nThe story still has plenty of the blockbuster elements that the franchise is known for, but manages to portray itself in a much more intelligent light. It's not just the typical action for action's sake type of game. The story has a well-written narrative that conspiracy buffs will surely love. Not only that, but the main character has a more vocal presence than any previous Call of Duty. The developers even decided to take a slightly more cinematic approach with the addition of a few cutscenes, rather than having dialogue throughout loading screens to help with the pacing. They managed to keep a good balance between set piece moments as well, which are just as intense as ever. Some of the most brutal melee kills are executed during stealth segments, and I imagine that's why they included an option to turn off "graphic" content at the start of the game.\n\nThe single player campaign wasn't the only bold evolution that took place, as the multiplayer component had its fair share of alterations. The most prominent is the new currency upgrade system. This new progression method allows players to earn "COD" points in addition to experience points during matches. Not only is this improvement leaps and bounds over the old, but it also gives players a level field by having all perks and attachments available for purchase at the start. Also, once you've unlocked the appropriate categories through ranking up, you can acquire any kill streak reward you wish or invest in an insane amount of customization options. Higher-tier weapons are still unlocked at certain ranks as well, but the advantages they once held are now an issue of the past.\n\nThis new Combat Training simulator lets you practice Free-For-All or Team Deathmatch modes against AI opponents. This is a great way for new players to work their way into an online multiplayer setting at their own pace, and will be a perfect way for clans to map out and plan new attack strategies. If that wasn't enough, Treyarch even included an in-depth Combat Record to give a detailed look at how your multiplayer stats break down. It includes everything from kill/death ratio graphs, individual weapon stats, to heat maps that show the main spots of activity. The training mode can even be played cooperatively online or locally with split-screen through all fourteen multiplayer maps at your disposal.\n\nAlthough the campaign doesn't support co-op play, the now-famous zombie mode certainly does. Even though fighting off the walking dead can be fun alone, it's even better with up to four players and is as frantic as ever. There is even a random zombie surprise that appears after the credits roll once you finish the campaign.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops is certainly not without its faults. The game has some decent looking graphics but is hindered by poorly rendered two-dimensional textures. This becomes even more apparent when you play the game in stereoscopic 3D, which is fully supported if your TV is also capable of this functionality. The 3D aspect obviously grants a better depth of field, but feels more like an attached gimmick than anything else. Fast camera movements become easily blurred, and the overall presentation gets a huge downgrade when it's turned on.\n\nBut aside from those minute missteps, Treyarch did an amazing of proving they can innovate within this franchise, and not be held back by their publisher's ongoing dispute. Their new vision for the Call of Duty series is definitely a bold step, but it's a step in the right direction. This game is jam-packed with content that is very well worth the price tag they're selling it for. The campaign is roughly a 7-8 hour ride, and a great one at that, and the multiplayer has a shelf life that will likely outlast the console it's played on.\n\nIn all honesty, the multiplayer component is so well thought-out that it could have been released as a stand-alone experience. The new upgrade system, the statistic tracking, and the vast amount of customization is enough to keep players engrossed for hours; and that's not even part of the gameplay. The real fun is getting to play with all the new kill streak rewards. They range anywhere from the incredibly entertaining RC-XD remote car bomb to a pack of gruesome attack dogs, and all are as satisfying as ever.\n\nIt'd be hard to argue that Black Ops is anything less than phenomenal. The campaign is thrilling from beginning to end, the competitive multiplayer is as addictive as ever, and there are plenty of zombies to be slaughtered for all the co-op junkies out there.","October 22, 2015","true","290.7"," 146 of 173 people (84%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","84","146","173","12","0"

The bad things, slightly framerate drops in multiplayer (dont worry, doesnt happen too much) but if its happen sometimes you want to kill someone at the same time its annoying. Chopper Gunner Killstreak in multiplayer is so overpowered and its worst thing that can happen to you, even with M.O.A.B i can deal with it in MW3 but not with CG in BO1. What i also dont like is, the massive action in singleplayer, they could have been lowered the action so you will not be bombarded with weapon noizes all the time and massive explosions also. Sure its cool and something that belongs to COD games but sometimes its too much.\n\nIf the games age (2010) doesnt matter, buy this COD if you are planning to buy your first COD on PC.","June 22, 2014","true","37.3"," 123 of 144 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","123","144","0","7"

I enjoyed it alot more than any other story of any other Call of Duty. The Controls where easy and the voice acting was great! The only annoying thing was that the default fov is 65. But if you look around on the internet you will find a guide that helps you changing it into 90. The Most annoying thing by far was that for some reason it didn't read my save file proper and after restarting the game I had to restart also the story. But after all the problems have been fixed I could enjoy the singleplayer like no other. It was worth going through that as I really felt some of the characters growing to my heart!\n\nZombiemode:\nThe Zombiemode in this game is alot different from the second, it is harder and also in my opinion alot scarier than Number 2. If you happen to play on your own you can have 90 fov but as soon as you play online and/or with your friends it will stay on 65 fov. Which I find personally annoying. But it is still a good game mode to play in singleplayer mode. It is alot of fun.\n\nMultiplayer:\nUnlike other Call of Dutys this game has an actual Serverbrowser where you can search for a server of any kind to join. Most of them do not have any admins anymore but it is still alot of fun to play on them. In the Multiplayer mode you can change and keep your FOV from 65 up to 90.\n\nAll in all this game is amazing, the graphics are still good looking and I had no problems running it on the highest setting. Although there is one thing I would like to mention. If you are german you will get the cut version because of Nazis and the Hackenkreuz. I do not know how much they cut out but I am pretty sure it must have been quiet a bit. I recommend you getting this game uncut from a key website. You will have the same fun as anybody else for a cheaper price!\n\nWhich is one of my last points. This game has a great singleplayer, story and zombie mode. But for the fact on how old this game is and that hardly anybody still plays the multiplayer (compared to more newer cods anyways) I recommend to get this game on sale.","October 18, 2015","true","18.5"," 80 of 99 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","80","99","6","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/boldimpression/recommended/42700/","boldimpression","Bold Impression","http://steamcommunity.com/id/boldimpression/","47 products in account","I vividly remember the hype over Call of Duty: Black Ops. Black Ops was going to be the next best thing. It was going to be great, and fix all the problems in the previous Call of Duty games. I wasn’t a COD player at that time, and had a bit of a more balanced view of the release. I knew that Black Ops wasn’t going to be the impeccable masterpiece the COD community was hyping it to be. I believed that, like the games that had come before it, Black Ops was going to have its own fair share of problems too.\n\nI vividly remember the community backlash when the game came out and players finally realized this. Most of the prominent members of the COD community grumblingly played Black Ops because it was the popular thing to do--until they eventually abandoned it and looked back to previous games, waiting anxiously for Modern Warfare 3 to come a savior. The golden age of Call of Duty seemed to be over.\n\nFortunately (or unfortunately to some) this is not where the story ends; for me, it was the beginning.\n\nI started to play Black Ops in its prime, a few months after it came out. It was my first real Call of Duty game (my only previous experience with the series was Call of Duty 2) and I was excited to play the game most people were playing. I discovered that the communities’ extreme reaction to Black Ops was a bit uncalled for.\n\nI originally braced myself for a pretty awful single player experience, but was pleasantly surprised at the story, plot, and characters. The single player is nothing revolutionary, but the characters are memorable (especially Woods) and the plot was compelling enough to make me sincerely want to see how it ended. I also found the missions, specifically the Vietnam missions, quite fun. Vorkuta is also highly memorable. In short, is a single player experience I could definitely see myself playing yet again.\n\nCo-op is almost equally as fun. Taking out endless waves of the zombified Nazis and other undead, aided by Perk-a-Colas, random mystery box guns, and Pack-a-Punched power weapons is a blast every time. Play with a group of dedicated friends, and let the good times swarm! I don’t like all the maps, but if you have people willing to play with you, then the expansion packs could be worth your money; with that many maps to choose from, I believe it would be difficult not to find at least one map that you all will enjoy playing together. Just a personal thought of mine though-- I wish that there were some kind of progress system in zombies--not just a "lets see how many waves we can get through in one game" approach. The amount of points earned in each match could be used as experience points to level up--more like the multiplayer experience. Just an idea, but this could have created a deeper gameplay experience.\n\nOf course, any Call of Duty player knows that the multiplayer is what makes or breaks an installment, no matter how good or bad the single player and/or co-op experiences are. For everything that Black Ops multiplayer does well, there are an equal number of points that flag for improvement. I think my favorite parts of the multiplayer are the emblems/playercards. Players have the ability to craft almost anything they want as a symbol for their playercard, and creative/ artistic players have the shapes to create some beautiful pieces of artwork!\n\nThe contract system is a fun way to gamble for extra CODpoints to spend on your custom classes. They are completely optional, and you can choose ones that conform to your personal skill level, but the greatest rewards come with the highest challenge. Daring players may also gamble with their hard-earned CODpoints in wager matches, but hardly anyone plays these modes anymore. CODpoints are new to the franchise, and I found it nice to spend cash-like money on equipment that I wanted.\n\nWhile weapons still unlock at certain levels, perks, grenades, and other equipment are all yours to buy as soon as custom classes are unlocked at level 4. I find all of the weapons unique, easily recognizable, and fun to experiment with--almost characters in their own right. I don’t like to use all of them, and players could definitely debate whether some of them are balanced. Certain weapons seem to be the go-to choices, but I don’t personally don’t feel any of them are “over-powered”. All of them have their own checks and balances: The M60 can tear through players, but is quite inaccurate; the Skorpion is devastating at point blank range but damage falloff is incredibly sharp; and the Commando is the king of assualt rifles, but doesn't unlock until level 44. The list can go on, but I believe with all these safety measures put in place, every player should be able to find at least one weapon he can enjoy using.\n\nThe maps are one of the biggest areas that need improvement. While I actually enjoy them all, Treyarch could do well to experiment with a different color pallet. When white, green, and brown are all the maps come in (the exception being Nuketown), these colors get old very quickly. The expansion pack maps are much more aesthetically exciting, but don’t expect to find too many servers that have them in the map rotation. If you really want to play them, gather some friends and start a custom game.\n\nA few other more minor things could use some tweaking. Hit markers were terrible when the game first came out, but have since been patched to the point where there are few issues with them, although I believe hitboxes tend to trail a tad too far behind the player. There are a couple of things that were never patched, however. Napalm strikes often have an invisible fire effect. Depending on the terrain over which the strike was laid down, there may be patches of earth left physically untouched by the fire, but players will still be killed if they run over these areas. Napalm and mortar strikes also have the bad habit of killing players in sturdy buildings when the strikes are directed on the roofs.\n\nI also wish that players weren’t allowed to make an “invisible” class. I don’t usually complain about weapons or equipment in this game (except Second Chance, which I hate with a passion) because I believe they all have the right to be used since the developers put them in the game, but it seems far too unbalanced to be allowed to run Ghost (Pro), Ninja (Pro), and a suppressor on both primary and secondary weapons. I do have to admit, though, I have only encountered a handful of players who use this setup.\n\nOverall, I find Black Ops a unique, but lukewarm experience. The weapons are striking and lively; the maps are not as exciting, but fun to play nonetheless. Contracts and CODpoints are interesting additions to the series, although some killstreaks can be frustrating to deal with. And both player emblems and custom classes can be beautiful or ugly, depending on the taste of the creator. All of the things done right mix with almost an equal blend of mistakes, creating an experience that is neither great nor bad. Ultimately though, I believe that COD players who approach Black Ops with an open mind, as the new branch of Call of Duty as it is, will find a lot of fun here. New players to the COD series may also enjoy Black Ops, although they should be prepared for a steep learning curve--this is still Call of Duty, and the gameplay is as fast and furious as it is deadly.\n\nWas Black Ops the next great thing to happen to Call of Duty? That would depend largely upon who you ask, but my answer is no. Does it deserve to go down in history as the game that ended COD’s golden age? Again, my answer is no. It may not continue the legacy of the games before it, but Black Ops is not an ending; rather it is the beginning of a new age of Call of Duty. And in my eyes, from what I have seen through my time with Black Ops, that age is looking surprisingly bright.","December 28, 2013","true","90.5"," 76 of 95 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","76","95","0","2"

The 1960's, CIA Black Ops in Russia and the Vietnam War, conspiracies, and a diabolical political plot to topple nations... all taken seriously in a totally immersive and epic experience. The gameplay is varied, indoors and outdoors, from lush tropical jungles to intelligence headquarters buildings, in a number of different historical conflicts. No spoilers, but the whole story is about finding a hidden, classified truth that is as mindblowing as the warheads that threaten to destroy the world. This dynamic and interesting campaign is unmatched, certainly throughout the Call of Duty series, as well as all the games I've played. It may not be the newest game, but the plot is worth it, I guarantee.\n\nAlthough the plot and story elements alone are enough to warrant a purchase, it is as fun of an ADS FPS as I've ever played, with decent graphics, punchy weapons, and great levels. I've played through the entire game on Veteran Difficulty, the most challenging difficulty, and had an absolute blast. There's not an overwhelming amount of collectables, and they remain found after multiple playthroughs.\n\nThe Zombies mode in this game is also great, probably better than Black Ops 2. It's not overly complicated like its sequel, and is just solid and hardy. I'm terrible at Zombies and still loved it. In one level you actually get to play as John F. Kennedy fighting zombies in the US Pentagon. Awesome? Awesome.\n\nOne of my favorites! This isn't a review for the multiplayer, but it is also spectacular and they come together when you get black ops.","March 11, 2015","true","24.3"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","28","31","0","1"

Shepherd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NotImBulletM9/","40 products in account","This game is too amazing for a review..... So instead heres a Wikipedia page of chicken....\n\n\n\nThe domestic chicken is descended primarily from the Red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and is scientifically classified as the same species.[19] As such it can and does freely interbreed with populations of red jungle fowl.[19] Recent genetic analysis has revealed that at least the gene for yellow skin was incorporated into domestic birds through hybridization with the Grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[20] The traditional poultry farming view is stated in Encyclopædia Britannica (2007): "Humans first domesticated chickens of Indian origin for the purpose of cockfighting in Asia, Africa, and Europe. Very little formal attention was given to egg or meat production... "[2] In the last decade there have been a number of genetic studies. According to one study, a single domestication event occurring in the region of modern Thailand created the modern chicken with minor transitions separating the modern breeds.[21] However, that study was later found to be based on incomplete data, and recent studies point to multiple maternal origins, with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa, originating from the Indian subcontinent, where a large number of unique haplotypes occur.[22][23] It is postulated that the Jungle fowl, known as the "bamboo fowl" in many Southeast Asian languages, is a special pheasant well adapted to take advantage of the large amounts of fruits that are produced during the end of the 50 year bamboo seeding cycle to boost its own reproduction.[24] In domesticating the chicken, humans took advantage of this prolific reproduction of the jungle fowl when exposed to large amount of food.[25]\n\nIt has been claimed (based on paleoclimatic assumptions) that chickens were domesticated in Southern China in 6000 BC.[26] However, according to a recent study,[27] "it is not known whether these birds made much contribution to the modern domestic fowl. Chickens from the Harappan culture of the Indus Valley (2500-2100 BC), in what today is Pakistan, may have been the main source of diffusion throughout the world." A northern road spread the chicken to the Tarim basin of central Asia. The chicken reached Europe (Romania, Turkey, Greece, Ukraine) about 3000 BC.[28] Introduction into Western Europe came far later, about the 1st millennium BC. Phoenicians spread chickens along the Mediterranean coasts, to Iberia. Breeding increased under the Roman Empire, and was reduced in the Middle Ages.[28] Middle East traces of chicken go back to a little earlier than 2000 BC, in Syria; chicken went southward only in the 1st millennium BC. The chicken reached Egypt for purposes of ♥♥♥♥ fighting about 1400 BC, and became widely bred only in Ptolemaic Egypt (about 300 BC).[28] Little is known about the chicken's introduction into Africa. Three possible routes of introduction in about the early first millennium AD could have been through the Egyptian Nile Valley, the East Africa Roman-Greek or Indian trade, or from Carthage and the Berbers, across the Sahara. The earliest known remains are from Mali, Nubia, East Coast, and South Africa and date back to the middle of the first millennium AD.[28] Domestic chicken in the Americas before Western conquest is still an ongoing discussion, but blue-egged chickens, found only in the Americas and Asia, suggest an Asian origin for early American chickens.[28]\n\nA lack of data from Thailand, Russia, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa makes it difficult to lay out a clear map of the spread of chickens in these areas; better description and genetic analysis of local breeds threatened by extinction may also help with research into this area.[28]\nSouth America\n\nAn unusual variety of chicken that has its origins in South America is the araucana, bred in southern Chile by the Mapuche people. Araucanas, some of which are tailless and some of which have tufts of feathers around their ears, lay blue-green eggs. It has long been suggested that they pre-date the arrival of European chickens brought by the Spanish and are evidence of pre-Columbian trans-Pacific contacts between Asian or Pacific Oceanic peoples, particularly the Polynesians, and South America. In 2007, an international team of researchers reported the results of analysis of chicken bones found on the Arauco Peninsula in south-central Chile. Radiocarbon dating suggested that the chickens were Pre-Columbian, and DNA analysis showed that they were related to prehistoric populations of chickens in Polynesia.[29] These results appeared to confirm that the chickens came from Polynesia and that there were transpacific contacts between Polynesia and South America before Columbus's arrival in the Americas.[30]\n\nHowever, a later report looking at the same specimens concluded:\n\nA published, apparently pre-Columbian, Chilean specimen and six pre-European Polynesian specimens also cluster with the same European/Indian subcontinental/Southeast Asian sequences, providing no support for a Polynesian introduction of chickens to South America. In contrast, sequences from two archaeological sites on Easter Island group with an uncommon haplogroup from Indonesia, Japan, and China and may represent a genetic signature of an early Polynesian dispersal. Modeling of the potential marine carbon contribution to the Chilean archaeological specimen casts further doubt on claims for pre-Columbian chickens, and definitive proof will require further analyses of ancient DNA sequences and radiocarbon and stable isotope data from archaeological excavations within both Chile and Polynesia.[31]\n\nAnd!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nGaben is love, Gaben is life! <3\n","January 18, 2015","true","12.4"," 87 of 147 people (59%) found this review helpful 198 people found this review funny","59","87","147","198","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/recommended/42700/","Sivarg","Siv","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sivarg/","391 products in account","Foreword\nThe first Black Ops in the game series, it is not much different from the rest of the previous games before it. Only the settings and story is different.\n\nStory\nThe story takes place in the 1960's, playing as Alex Mason, an american operative who is interrogated by unknown captors.\nThey question his previous missions, which take place in various countries. The story heavily focuses on the Cold War Era, and there are several famous people during the Cold War who appear in this game, such as Kennedy and Castro.\nYou can expect all kinds of classic CoD cliché's from previous games in this one, aswell as a twist.\n\nGameplay & Graphics\nThe gameplay is very, very much the same as previous Call of Duty titles. Despite this, the multiplayer feels different from previous and newer CoD MP games. It feels more "grittier" with turning, shooting and especially reloading. Not even Black ops 2 MP has this. Overall the animations feel more focused when firing and reloading.\n\nThe MP of this game is no different from previous games, there are tons of different game modes, a fair amount of maps, lots of weapons and the usual killstreaks. Being a first (This was in 2010 again), you can customize your characters with face paints, and there are quite alot to unlock.\nUnlike previous MP's, you get "CoD" points each match that you can use to unlock everything with.\n\nThe game also includes a Zombies mode, having up to 4 co-op players team up against waves upon waves of zombies. The aiming in this feels abit stiff, and sometimes when firing at a zombies head despite aiming perfectly well, the shots may miss.\nThe settings and story in zombies mode is of a supernatural theme, with anything from zombies, ghosts and hounds from hell.\n\nThe graphics, for a 2010 game, are very good. Back then, it was of course something really well made, graphics wise.\nThough if you are looking for something amazing for todays standards, you are going to be abit dissapointed.\n\nWould I recommend it? If so, why?\nYes, I would, but only for the hardcore CoD fans. The MP side is great and what most buyers back in 2010 went for. Today, 2015, I'd say you have to see the story and zombies mode as a bonus when buying the game. The MP side of the game is still very active and has players on servers 24/7, even late night. There are also alot of achievements, both story mode and in zombies. MP there are only 3 achievements.\n\nThis game is not worth its price tag of 39,99 though. It is 5 years old, and strangely the devs haven't lowered the price. Get it on a sale instead, but even then, you're lucky if you get it for 10.\n\nPraise & Criticism\nI really enjoyed the twist in the story mode.\n\nI was impressed by the menu, having not seen this style in any other game.\n\nI was not impressed by the DLC map packs, and it is very known these days that not many play the map packs anymore, leaving you with a waste of money, so keep this in mind.\n\nYou can't review the DLC Map packs individually like other games have on steam. While there are some reviews on them, they are few, and simple, and no doubt done by the devs/friends of the devs, raising the question as to why the reviewing has been disabled for these map packs.\n\n\nSince I can't review the dlc by itself, it'll go here\nFIRST CONTACT MAP DLC REVIEW\nThis review was written months before the main game one, and is mean't as a negative review\n\n\nTL:DR: DONT BUY THIS DLC, ITS OVER 4 YEARS OLD AND CANT BE PLAYED ANYMORE DUE TO LIMITED PLAYERBASE.\n\nNegative rating explained.One of the steep priced DLC's I've ever bought and regretted. It's surprising how this has so many positive reviews, but they are all funnily enough extremely short. No doubt some fanboys or devs decided to boost this dlc's rep by making such a short review.\n\nThis dlc comes at full price, 13,99 euro, way to much for something that's over 4 years old by now from this review. A typical marketing strategy from the devs and their publisher, simply leave the price tag at full since launch, with very few sales.\n\nThis dlc has 5 different maps, nothing more, nothing less. No bonus weapons and such.\n4 multiplayer maps and 1 zombie mode map.\nNow I bought this dlc simply for MP maps, not the zombie one, but I saw that as an extra bonus.\nToday I defently regret this, and this is no way worth its full price. It's a downright scam if you press to buy it for 13,99 euro, there is alot of other stuff you can spend your money on.\n\nSo why the negative review? Because, all CoD games have this dlc problem pattern. When a new CoD game comes out, the playerbase moves on to the next new thing and abandons (75% of the players atleast) the previous game/s. This leaves a very little, staggering playerbase left, and thus the amount of players who own the dlcs can't find any new games to play these dlc maps. This is why there should never have been dlc map packs in the first place. I admit I fell for the trap. Not once or twice, but thrice, having bought a beautifull map pack in MW3 and BO2. Don't take me wrong, these maps are fun to play on, and are stunningly beautiful. The issue here is not being able to play the dlc anymore. You have to either find friends to start a game and play with, or simply try and hit daytime in hope there just might be a server or two. The chances are extremely low.\n\nThe Maps.The Maps are detailed, entertaining to play on.\n\nBerlin Wall\nA map based on the Berlin Wall, fighting in the snow covered streets of the german capital, the map features a "restricted zone" in the middle among the walls. Running through it will cause automated turrets in towers to kill you. Two parts of the walls have been blown apart and players are able to run between safely from the towers.\n\nDiscovery\nA map set in the Antartica, an abandoned german base with thin cliff bridges that can be shot or exploded to cause humiliating deaths to players. Perfect for any snow/ice lovers, contains the Southern Lights.\n\nKowloon\nA map set in Hong Kong on building rooftops (You better believe it). Players clash with eachother throughout these large buildings filled with the classic stuff that every major, packed city has (signs, chimneys, antenna's etc). Surprisingly, the buildings still stand after the matches end and a good amount of airstrikes have been used. A good old CoD logic.\n\nStadium\nA map set at a  hockey stadium in New York, the fights focuses around the outside of the stadium aswell as inside where the ticket booths are. You can't enter into the hockey arena. The map lives up to its name though, the feeling of being at a stadium is well received in this map. Has a large 'Earth' statue fountain in the middle of it.\n\nAscension\nThe only zombie map in this pack, Ascension takes place in an abandoned Soviet Cosmodome. Instead of Hellhounds, zombified monkeys appear instead, straight from space! The WWII characters make their apperance in this map from the World at War Zombie cast.\n\n\nThe maps are great, but for the price, it's simply too steep, counting the age of this dlc aswell. Not only that, but the chances of playing the 4 MP maps with other random players are slim.","December 29, 2015","true","11.2"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","16","20","0","0"

When it's handled by Treyarch. Overall an improvement over Modern Warfare 2, while also serving as well written and well performed sequel to World at War. The combat is smoother, it (the game) looks slicker and is more colorful, and the singleplayer is probably the tightest in the franchise up to this point. The multiplayer also remains a highlight, being a huge improvement over the previous titles, and I'd argue better than any of the later titles. It's the single-most solid CoD entry, apart from the original and Modern Warfare.\n\nThe few cons, though, primarily rest in the multiplayer. Although it may be the best laid out version of the famous game mode, there are some balancing issues in terms of some weapons; namely the FAMAS. Now, for the most part, if a weapon is over-powered, then use it. The issue with it is the whole leveling up system, which means that newer players either rely on luck, the also powerful MP5K, or try to find maps where there aren't too many FAMAS players.\n\nIn addition, the CoD Points system is a great idea, but could have been better implemented. For example, what's the point of obtaining points when all of the weapons are still locked by level requirements? You might earn a  lot of CoD Points, but they're useless if you want a weapon you need several more levels to unlock with. EIther leveleing should open up more than one thing to buy, thus giving you more options to spend your money on at a time in the early and later games (Note that mid game more things do become unlocked at a stime, but this usually centers around different logo layers or reticules, all of which are cosmetic features). Note that when you do buy a weapon, you have all of the attachements unlocked. You just need to spend CoD Points on them. That makes sense, but why only the attachments? This mode could have worked better, but still does some things right. Overall, the redundancy of parts of the point system can still be overlooked.\n\nUltimately, we're still looking at one of CoD's more solid modern gen entries, and I'd suggest picking it up. Good servers can be difficult to find (There's a ton of so-called "Tactical Crouch Servers," and other servers ban game elements outright), but with or without, the singleplayer and the Co-Op Zombies mode are also very fun to play.\n\n\n(NOTES: Aside from the PC, I've also played this game far more extensively on the PS3 and Nintendo Wii, totalling more than a hundred or more hours)","July 9, 2015","true","6.6"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","18","24","3","2"

But why?\n\nCampaign - Takes you through a fun adventure during the Cold War. Fun gameplay (Kowloon potentially the best CoD mission ever), great characters (Jason Hudson as portrayed by Ed Harris) and interesting story with a nice twist.\n\nZombies - This is just a simply incredible gamemode. It has such an addicting factor to get to a higher round, but is also plagued with secrets and a lot to do within each map keeping it mostly fresh and it goes on and on. The Rezurrection also brought the old World at War maps back, which includes my personal favorite map, Der Riese. This rendition of Zombies was also improved from its predecessor, World at War. Although you cannot create your own maps this time, sadly, it provides for an excellent experience. All maps are good and worth playing and it introduces more legendary maps like Ascension and Moon to add to the collection.\n\nMultiplayer - The great thing about this is that its skill based, and encapsulates all methods of playstyle. Maps are a variety of sizes, and each map is its own unique adventure and a change of pace from the last. As much as I'm not a big fan of smaller maps that much, this game has 2-3 which make it a nice change of pace. Guns are balanced, and all do relativley the same thing so that you don't lose a fight simply because of circumstance. Recoil is in the guns, and many battles take place at medium - long range so you need to be good with the gun to get a kill. It moves at just the right speed; you can be in a fight mostly whenever you want but can also pursure flanking and you won't be in a clusterf**k all the time. WMD is also probably the best multiplayer map ever; representative of all playstyles, isn't too small and isn't too big. It also has CoD Points, the best the series has done yet from an unlocking perspective. It's the slow of the fast paced gameplay, exactly what I like. This game is just excellent. DLC's are just as great with maps such as Zoo, Hotel, Discovery and Hazard (remake of Cliffside from World at War).\n\nBonus: An entire twin stick shooter game is within this game, known as Dead Ops Arcade. This is an absurd amount of fun, and really adds on to the package of this game. Also included is the text based game Zork, which can provide a great past time. In addition, the hidden intel and computer that lets you logon to characters profiles provides for great backstory and nice information for what happend before, during and after and insight into each character.\n\nThis is just the best FPS ever.

If you're basing your opinion off this game just because you played Black Ops II or Ghosts, you're not going to have a fantastic time. I find that the Nazi Zombies gameplay was greatly done. It was not over the top and it used original game elements from World at War, sticking to the original style and going classic, while at the same time adding lots of necessary and new features.\n\nThe map packs are overpriced in people's opinions. I did not have Black Ops on Steam when it came out - I bought it here a couple months ago so I could enjoy it all over again. If I had to estimate, I'd say I clocked about 3,000 hours on the console version? (Dirty me!) It was fantastic. Owning all of the map packs the day they came out, I was addicted to Zombies. However, I did not enjoy the currency system applied on the multiplayer. Opinions are opinions, it was cool, but grew old quickly trying to farm so much XP.\n\nOverall - 8/10\n\nThe multiplayer flaws are arguable. I cannot ignore them, so I will have to deduct a few points off as multiplayer is a large part of the game. However, Zombies was a very enjoyable and addictive experience that promised a unique experience, especially when you played with friends on a co-op game.","October 11, 2014","true","22.7"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

The campaign I thought was excellent with likable characters. great storyline, and the era it takes place in. Another reason why this game is amazing is the well known co op game mode as Nazi Zombies. The zombie maps are amazing including the revamped version of the old 4 maps from World at War, the new maps as well is spot on with challenging bosses and many new wonder weapons. As for the multiplayer as well the multiplayer is amazing as you get to customize your character in the game and create fun  classes to use in the game, and the maps are just well done.

It allows you to play campaign, multiplayer and zombies mode. Campaign is designed really good and it's really enjoyable. For multiplayer it's the last Call of Duty with dedicated servers. Dedicated servers allows you to play all what you want. You can play ranked or unranked matches and also mods such as sniper only and paintball. Multiplayer has a lot of new game modes to play. Weapons are really nice if you compare them with other Call of Duty'es. There is no hackers because of dedicated servers. Multiplayer also have normal ammount of levels so you will play game pretty long to reach max level/prestige. Its also first Call of Duty with bots so you can play with bots too. Zombies mode is upgraded from Call of Duty World at War. It is really fun to play co-op with friends and try to survive as much rounds as you can.\n\nLike i said It's one of the best game from Call of Duty franchise so It is totally worth of money. I reccommend it to every FPS and Call of Duty fan. If you want to continue campaign you will need to buy Call of Duty Black Ops 2.\n10/10","November 29, 2013","true","8.2"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

( In order to recieve a steam badget as adverticed )\n\n\nIn another term I can say how much I do like Black Ops 1 by giving it a number between 1 and 6.\n\n\nMy  father  once told me  "never  say 6" when you get such questions.  It can always be better (updates extencions etc).  Black Ops 1 is only as good as what few human creatores minds can create at a time and in given time set by an economic frame.  Hope it can keep up with present time.\n\n\nMost exceptional in mind is maybe M r M icrosoft himself [ hehehe M. M. ( 'Master Mind' ) ], and Master Mind |ZEC| Ken who is a MapMaker.  I take of my flossyhat for both.\n\n\nI will give Black Ops 1 á 5.  I have my reasons for why its not a 6 in my opinion.\n\n\nF example in private lobby, if you choose map Riese  and  push  rdy you go  in Riese.  But after I as host restart a new match it goes into Kino Toten map-mode. At least if its with the same  players  it  should remember and automatically pick Riese map again if host himself doesn*t change the map.\n\n\nBut brotherhood !  In games !  Isn*t Black Ops 1 the best ?\nAt least as a starter game ( hehe ).\n\n\nExcuse me for using this opportunity to also mention that in steam achievements you can easily achieve the badget "Ambassador" in "Gold colour"\n\n\nThe true ambassadors in my opinion are the players inside and outside clan's / Groups who act like ambassadors in their behavior by leading rookies and prospects into right path and understanding of each map by sharing some of their wisdom, and information they give about community customs.\n\n\nThe supreme ambassadors are therefore in my opinion the Master in Maps who makes guide video's / give some gametime to rookies etc.  I have been lucky and met supreme  ambassadores but unfortuanetly I want mention their gamingnames in respect of their privacy but they are for real.\n\n\nIts harder to run in headwind than in tailwind, but please no hack, cheat or glitch !\n\n\nHope my laptop can hold many more hours in Black Ops 1.

The perfomance is fine and I didn't encounter any bugs but there are so many important flaws you can't look past in the PC release:\n\n- Some campaign levels have parts with missing lighting (character models are totally black)\n\n- No way to start a public game without buying a dedicated server (Private games are still creatable but you can only play with friends)\n\n- No matchmaking system other than the game randomly picking a dedicated server from the list which may not even be the gamemode you want\n\n- The multiplayer is mostly dead at this point with there being a peak of slightly higher than 500 players at the time of this review's creation with 90% of those being on custom modded lobbies.  The only real servers you will find with people in them are 24/7 Team Deathmatch or Nuketown servers with the only servers that support DLC Maps being based in Japan. This pretty much means its impossible to play any of the DLC content for the game without creating a private game and having a bunch of friends ready to play whenever you are\n\n- No party/party matchmaking system which means you can't search for games with a premade group of friends, you have to all join a random server and be lucky enough to have enough open space to all be on the same team (The 360 and PS3 version had this feature)\n\n[Revisited and updated April 2016]","April 17","false","6.8"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

I remember playing this game on the 360 the year it came out and enjoyed the multiplayer and zombies, although as time progressed I ended up forgetting about it and sold my 360. I recently decided to buy it again for the PC off of another website for about $10 since it's still overly expensive on steam and these are my thoughts on it:\n\nCAMPAIGN\n\nSince I never got to finishing the campaign on the Xbox I decided to play it again and actually finished it. Graphics are still pretty impressive for a 5 year old game. The campaign provided amazingly fun gameplay and a very engaging story that kept me playing until the end; I was also really surprised by how intriguing the story was and it was definitely worth the play time I put into completing it. I'm sure a lot of people new to the game will enjoy it as much as I did.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\n\nMultiplayer is enjoyable, although to some it may look like it's just been completely dominated by hardcore game modes which some people might find out of their comfort zone, although softcore game modes still exist it just takes a bit of searching for. Most of the community is mature since most of the CoD kiddies are found on console so no need to worry about 9 year olds screaming into their turtlebeaches.\n\nZOMBIES\n\nThe Zombies game mode is still very enjoyable especially with others and surprisingly it's not that hard to find an online lobby(for me at least). You can also play with your friends which I strongly recommend doing unless you're hardcore and like going solo. If you plan on buying this for the zombies you should also pick up the Rezzurection DLC since they only really give you 3 zombies maps in the base game which can get boring after awhile for some people.\n\nOverall I'd give this game a 9/10 and it was worth the amount I paid. I'd recommend this to any fan of the classic CoDs such as CoD4, WaW etc. or anyone who is a fan of FPS games and/or shooting zombies.","April 8, 2015","true","40.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heavybullet/recommended/42700/","heavybullet","HeavyBullet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heavybullet/","1446 products in account","The story... Geezus, the story of Black Ops is far beyond awesomeness. I mean the Modern Warfare trilogy is damn good at the story as well, the 3 games give a big whole, but I think I slightly like more this one. I play Call of Duties for the campaign mode, I'm barely interested in the multiplayer. No doubt, killin' each other in CoD's multiplayer is very entertaining and a great fun, but I buy CoD's for the story most of all. I'm more like a co-operative person. Yeah, there are co-op modes in the latest CoD's, I know and I like the Spec Ops', yet I think instead of this it would be greater if we could play the story mode co-operatively (like World at War). Well... the other thing, the Zombie Mode. No, I don't like it. It's terrible for me and damn boring. And I hate the pointless survival type of co-op (yet somehow I really enjoy MW3's survival, dunno why, but that's cool). I love killing zombies, but not in CoD's.\nOne more little thing. I started this game not long ago for the first time (yeah, I was late about 5 years, but who gives a damn...) and I played it after MW3, which was the next CoD after Black Ops. The funny thing is that the BO has more beautiful graphics than MW3. :D It doesn't matter, it's just strange. The other technical stuffs, like controls, sound effects, music, voice acting, animations are pretty good - so the usual CoD quality.\nAND THERE'S A SCENE WHEREIN YOU FLY A CHOPPA AND SHOOT/BLOW UP LOTSA ENEMIES AND OTHER CHOPPAZ!!!! There's no word how much I love it. I love flying attack helicopters in general, so that part of the game was really sweet for me. Yeah, actually there are two scenes of it, but the second one is pretty short and altough it was fun, too, not that big hit like the first one. The only problem I got with it is the controls. I really could use an ascend/descend movement, but it went automatically and sadly it made the aiming impossible sometimes.\nAnyway, I recommend this game for the great, exciting, interesting and intense 60's cold war story, it's really worth the play.","November 21, 2015","true","31.2"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/42700/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Call of Duty: Black Ops was released in 2010. It can be played in single player mode as well as Multiplayer Mode and Zombies: Multiplayer Mode, both of which are immensely fun. Having played it to 100% completion on the PS3 already, I can't give it any higher praise. Only games that I think are fantastic do I bother putting in the kind of effort to achieve 100%. You play as Alex Mason, a soldier who is being held and interrogated, as you progress through various black ops Mason went on over several years. I can't go into more detail without spoilers, so I will leave it at that.\n\nCall of Duty: Black Ops, plays the same way previous titles in the Call of Duty franchise, so if you like that style, Black Ops won't disappoint. Multiplayer is actually rather fun with Black Ops, as is Zombies Mode, where you can play on several Maps and must survive waves of zombies with a team of other players. Call of Duty: Black Ops has went on to be successful enough to spawn 2 sequels, which I have not yet had the chance to play, but that does speak volumes of how popular the game was and still is. If you like first person action/shooters, Black Ops is a must play.","December 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

It's not a sandbox and there are many QTEs. Overall it's still a good experience but the replaying potential's poor.\n\nI won't say much about the Multiplayer mode since I don't play it much. From what I've seen, it's mostly like the previous versions with new maps and new options in the same style.\n\nThe zombie maps are good, two basics: Kino Der Toten and Five. Both are good, Five will have you survive in close quarters. "Dead Ops Arcade" isn't really a zombie map but a 2D like shooting mini game.\nThe four DLCs are expensive for what they bring: about $15 each even though they're getting older and older. Buying them when there's a -50% firesale is a good deal.\n\nAscension and Call Of The Dead are fine, Shangri La and Moon are really hard (mostly in early rounds for Moon, then it's easy).\nThe easter eggs are hard too, especially on Shangri La where four players are required, and Moon's normally requires to complete first COTD and Shangri La's easter eggs too (or have at least 1 player in the party who completed both easter eggs, or possibly 1 player with COTD's ee and another with Shangri's ee).\nThe last DLC Rezurrection pack is really worth buying if you haven't played the previous zombie maps from CoD 5 World At War (though these maps are free on CoD 5 WaW). These maps are back with BO weapons, Mule Kick and Monkey Bombs. Last but not least, the Wunder Waffe does not zapp the Juggernog anymore on Der Riese.\n\nThe gameplay is different in the sense that zombies won't stop/glue you anymore when you touch them, so that's rather a good point. But what disturbed me the most is the way zombies now shout: 1 zombie alone can make several shouts at the same time (??!!!), unlike CoD 5 WaW where 1 zombie could make only 1 shout at a time (sounds logic since a zombie doesn't have more than 1 mouth...), so you could use the sound of the game to be a better killer (at the end and the beginning of a round, you could feel - or hear - how many zombies were left or spawning on the map, which was extremely helpful. It used to be possible to locate a zombie with the sound it made, especially when one was coming in your back, but now you can only rely on what you see because the map is overwhelmed with shoutings). So this huge advantage is lost.\nNext I don't like the way knifing has changed since CoD 5 WaW: knifing from a short distance was possible, the character was charging into the nearest zombie. Now in BO the character will still do it, but it's more or less random, so you really have to go in front of the zombie by yourself. Sometimes the character will even charge even though you didn't want to do so, and that may lead you into a very bad position...\n\nUsing bindings is still possible fortunately, but this requires to edit the config file before launching the game (no in game console, this has been patched). Cheats are still working in solo, maybe infinite ammo too in coop and provided you're the host. The "give all" cheat has been tampered with and will actually take all your points and guns. I like the "noclip" code just to take a tour and visit the map.\n\nNow on to the drawbacks:\nthe worst thing, in my view, is the DRM. There's NO way to play zombies solo offline. So what if I want to play zombies solo, say in the train on my laptop? Or if my ISP has a breakdown? That also means that when the BO servers are shut down, we will have no way to play zombies, even in solo, ever (there might be a possibility in LAN, but that requires some digging...).\nEdit: there are 2 workarounds I know. The first and fastest requires however to start the game online, then once the map is loaded, cut your connection.\nThe second and most efficient workaround is to simply bind a key to a map:\nbind KEY "devmap MAPNAME"\n\nKino = zombie_theater\nFive = zombie_pentagon\nAscension = zombie_cosmodrome\nCall of the Dead = zombie_coast\nShangri-La = zombie_temple\nMoon = zombie_moon\nNacht der Untoten = zombie_cod5_prototype\nVerrückt = zombie_cod5_asylum\nShi No Numa = zombie_cod5_sumpf\nDer Riese = zombie_cod5_factory\nDead Ops Arcade = zombietron\n\nFor example: bind F9 "devmap zombie_theater"\n\n\nAnother disastrous point is the inability to "restart" a game when hosting a private server. The host must end the game, wait for the game over screen, then load back to the lobby, and load once again the same map. Abominably awkward!\nThere's a workaround: by binding a key to "fast_restart". It makes really no sense that this option is disabled.\n\nBlack Ops 1 also marks the shift from the publisher to focus from PC to consoles: now PC players just get ports from console versions. That means the end of the golden age for Call Of Duty on PC since mods and custom maps aren't allowed anymore. Look at the old Doom or CoD 5 World at War: people are still playing these games thanks to the ability to create custom maps and play mods. That's what keeps people playing these games, sustain a player base and gives all sense to "personal" as in personal computer. No wonder the BO1 zombies player base has been shrinking more and more.\n\nFollowing this trend to go "consolish", the next thing that I dislike is the server system: you can not open a public server anymore but only a private server where only your friends (and recently met players) may join. So unlike CoD 5 WaW, it's not possible anymore to kick awkward random players and / or have them to abide by some rules, like no stealing, advise everybody to reload before taking a Max Ammo etc. (There's a workaround if you want to be the host and avoid those kids killing the server after going down: the first player in the lobby is the host. So if you find someone when looking for a game, just leave the server, wait a bit and look again for a game. When you're the first and only one in a game, that means you're the host). On the other hand, an interesting feature is the possibility to see everybody's records on the leaderboards.\n\nSomething else that I think is missing is the ability to see the  activity online: how much servers/players are online. Unlike CoD 5 WaW or BO2, there's nothing to show it (except Steam charts, but this is off game).\n\nSo, I've been disappointed by many things with BO1, but overall, it's still a good game for zombie fans and for those who like the CoD Multiplayer system.","December 1, 2014","true","389.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The soundtrack is very catchy and fits the game's theme well.\n\nThe PC port is pretty good.

With their pass game history of mediocre games (CoD 3 and CoD WAW). They have set the bar high with Black Ops. Black Ops comes out on top of MW2 with vast improvements and most importantly, dedicated servers for multi-player. As well, the online RPG leveling system allows players to purchase which perks they like instead of having to work through a pre-determined list of perks. Beautiful multi-player maps, balanced guns, and crisp controls make the multi-player experience unforgettable. The single player campaign is roughly 7-8 hours of story-compelling, non-stop action. A game that can deliver a good story while making the characters feel believable and alive is a rare occasion. If you are a CoD fan, this is a must purchase. If you like FPS, but dislike CoD games.

Three patches post release, and they still haven't addressed the problem.  Also, being unable to directly connect to a server that you've paid for because the server browser doesn't work correctly and they seem to have left the \connect and \reconnect commands out of the console... just make this game yet another cluster♥♥♥♥ in a line of cluster♥♥♥♥s.  If it wasn't for the fact that Treyarch was riding the wave of a successful franchise, or riding the wave of other franchises in general (such as James Bond), they wouldn't be a successful development house at all.\nI will reserve judgement on the game itself until I can actually play it.

It's a story I would play over multiple times. The story obviously revolves around the Cold War and U.S. Special Forces who try to prevent mass conflict by confining it to small targeting ops and raids. The story leads you through several moments in U.S. Cold War history like Vietnam, Cuba, and Russia. If you are a fan of the Call of Duty series then this would be a good buy for you.","January 19, 2015","true","1.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

After the massive disappointment that was Modern Warfare 2, I was extremely skeptical on Black Ops. Good thing I was disappointed here too.\n\nThe launch was extremely shaky on PC, but now that they've patched it a few times, the game works pretty well. What you'll find, should you choose to get it, is arguably the best Call of Duty campaign to date. It's dark. It's gritty. It's even disturbing. Most of all though, it delivers the trademark Call of Duty intensity whilst daring to be different. After you've gone through that, there's the return of Zombies mode (which I'm personally not a fan of) from World at War, and the deep multiplayer experience. In fact, Black Ops is the most well-balanced CoD game to date, wherein nothing is too over or underpowered and you have customization options like never before.\n\nDownside? It's the 7th CoD game. It's getting stale.","December 24, 2010","true","8.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's the game where everything started for me, I had actually just started gaming back then. Black Ops had already been out for more then 2 years back then. I joined a FFA Sniper Server and in the start, I really disliked it. So I decided to play CoD4, after 80 hours on Sniper Only servers in CoD4 (I brought BO and CoD4 at the same time on Steam), I decided to try Black Ops again, and thats when I fell in love with the game. As I said, sniping was all new to me and Black Ops is different from the rest of the CoD's. Generally the old CoD's has more style over them, making them more unique and exciting to play. I spent alot of time afk in the game when I just started, hoping that more "playtime" on Steam would gain me more respect, my first clan was sh*t, since the leader was a lying ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I started my days out on the Rebel servers. When I just gained Prestige 15, lvl 27, I decided to try to join Aizen to see what kind of servers he was playing on when he didnt play on the Rebel HC SnD server. That's how my days in cK, eXo etc. started. I got into the softcore community on the SwMt server. I gained alot of new friends, people liked me and I loved the game. Theres alot of colours, especially compared to the other CoD's, they are bright and tempting. Black Ops has some bugs, bad hitreg unless you have a good PC + Net, lags, the reset bug wich made me lose 111000 kills, atleast I didnt lose my prestige and classes. But even thou Black Ops has some of these bugs, that really pisses you off and makes you angry, I still love it.\n\nThe Black Ops community isnt the same to me anymore, alot of my friends quitted, plays rarely or moved on to another game. Theres alot of guys I dislike, theres alot of things I dislike about the game but I will always remember my golden days in Black Ops as the best in my gaming career.\nI might not play as much Black Ops as I used to, mainly because of my lags. I might play a bit more  again when I get my new PC working.\n\nBut thanks to everyone in the Black Ops community for great laughs, games and fights. It's been awesome.\n\n6/6","December 14, 2013","true","30.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

The battlefield missions are way better and harder. So i started playing only the Nazi Zombies mode and it caught my attention. It's actually not bad at all I enjoyed playing it.

Call of Duty: Black Ops is definitley worth picking up.  Some of my personal favorite zombies maps are in this game. A few titles being: Kino Der Toten, Moon, and Ascension.The campain is entertaining for solo players and brings out brand new gadgets to try out.  The Multiplayer mode is mostly balanced and is very fun if you can find the right servers.  For a player new to shooters, the controls may be odd for the first couple of roundsm, but after a while you will see them to be very accessible.

But it did feel different after all those hours playing Modern Warfare 2. I kinda expected the controls to feel the same, but they didn't (somehow it felt sluggish). But you'll adjust soon enough.

The Multiplayer mode is mostly balanced and is very fun if you can find the right servers.  For a player new to shooters, the controls may be odd for the first couple of roundsm, but after a while you will see them to be very accessible.

Well then oh boy do I have news for you! In this next installment of the popular franchise, Treyarch has truly outdone themselves with this one. It has all of the guns you could possibly want ranging from knives to even such more exotic types of weapony like assault rifles or grenades. In all of my time played I reached Prestige 15 by only using knife and noob toob and playing nuketown. If that's not a recipe for success for a game I honestly don't know what is. I'm eagerly awaiting the next installment of this truly outrageous franchise. 11/10 because no water level.\n\nP.S. I actually have 1,100 hours of in-game multiplayer time racked up but the hours played showed in the review is for the single player. Check the multiplayer in my library for the evidence.

You can clearly see that 3arc care more about the PC verson than IW. Why is this game better that the others?\n\nSingleplayer: The singleplayer takes place in the Vietnam era which is rly interesting. They combine it with a little science fiction and thriller. The athmosphere is rly good thanks to these features. The gameplay is usual cod but the story has more focus on the charaters rather than the war itself. The guns have rly cool sounds and visuals tho the overall visuals are not outstanding.\n\nMultiplayer: Peronally I think this is better than BO2. The setting gives the muliplayer a rly awesome vibe. The maps have old school layout and you can find parts where you can interact with silo doors and stuff. The other thing is there are moving objects like the train, the rockets launches and other stuff which gives you extra immersion.\nLast but not least the balance. Best! You can counter any offensive device with perks and equipments. Many player complain about the RC-XD but i bet they didn't use flak jacket.\nThere are many corrections like they removed juggernaut and the perks that gives more weapon dmg.\nOnly big problem is the performace cuz it is not very smooth. If you have an older 2 core CPU it can be a pain to run smoothly. But it works fine if you are using promod. Oh i forgot it supports player mods and dedicated servers that u can rent. :)\n\nBO2 is better in performance and the pick10 system is rly cool. The orther stuff are inferior compared to the 1st game.\n\nDLC: If you like zombies you can buy them but don't buy it for muliplayer.\n\n\nVerdict:\n\nPro: Setting, Cool Guns, Interesting attachments, nice level design (except nuketown), reflex based twitch shooter, dedicated servers and mod tools\n\nCon: DLC's are pricey and good only for zombies, no FOV silder in singleplayer, performance is not good on older machines","July 3, 2011","true","194.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But with a base line at 60 FPS, games like CS:GO give me what i deserve as a consumer more so than their 45-60 fps lameness. 200-300fps is where it is at on PC with CS nowdays, even though this unique blend sure has had it's good moments trough time.","September 27, 2015","true","97.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Period.\n\nI am really blown away by how great this game is. I have always been more of a fan of the CoD games set in Modern times, but this one is in the Cold War. On top of that, there are TONS of negative reveiws about the stutter. So naturally, my expextations were pretty low, but that all changed when I played it.\n\nFirst off, I am playing on a midrange laptop, and while it's not as powerful as I would like, it's still a nice little gaming machine. Even with my less-than-impressive computer, this game, which was said to have a stutter even on people's big custom "console killers", ran at a steady 35-40 fps with no stutter or lag of any kind, with everything all the way up except anti-aliasing (I always turn it off because it's such a fps killer).\n\nThe Campaign is the best I've played, with a complex story that jumps around through time and plot twists that surprised the hack out of me. Nothing is repetitive, and everything you do really feels like it matters in the story and is't a filler. As an added bonus for Waw fans, two characters return (YAY!) The multiplayer is also very, very fun.\n\nAbout the price: As good as it is, it's a five year old game that is not worth 40 dollars. I recomend getting it on Amazon, because it's only 20 dollars there. Saving 20 dollars was worth the wait. Also, don't get it used, because the code will already be used and you won't be able to play it.\n\nThe verdict: This is a great game that you really should get. Buy it new on Amazon for 20 dollars, get it in the mail, take off the plastic rap, shove that disc into your computer, dowload it, and then play like there's no tomorrow.","November 10, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

MW3 doesn't add much to the game dynamic... at least not at this point in it's development.

This is possibly one of my favorite Call of Duty games alongside MW3, and I still enjoy playing it today. Yes, the multiplayer may have quite a bit of cheaters, but I have a lot of good memories on this game dating back to its release date. I have never dedicated so much time to a Call of Duty game before and it just makes me sad to see what Call of Duty is turning into now. Advanced Warfare looks like complete crap to me and I wish they would come up with something unique and original to give me the same experience that I had on the older games like this. Call of Duty: Ghosts already took it too far with the Aliens, and Advanced Warfare is going to take it even farther. I am going to wait for Treyarch's next realease and see what they do. If their next realease is horrible, then I am calling it an end to Call of Duty. It had it's time but it looks like it's drifting away.","August 10, 2014","true","19.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Whatever you do, don't alt + tab when you are playing zombies on Kino der Toten after turning on the power; the curtains will close again (you'll still be able to walk through it, but it is pretty annoying since you won't be able to see zombies on the other side of the curtain) If you need to exit the game at any point, just play in windowed mode setting.\n\nI've been having launch issues with the game. Whenever I open the game it crashes unless I change up the launch settings (have to switch between dx9 and dx11 everytime I open the game). Not sure if this is a common problem.\n\nSince this is an older game, it isn't worth the $43.99. I suggest buying the steam key else where for a cheaper price. There are no more dedicated servers so multiplayer isn't as great as it once was. This game is worth buying for the zombies game mode.","March 19","true","90.8"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I still enjoy the !@$% out of it though.\n\nControls (7/10)\nThe Controls are not the greatest in the world. for example, you might accidently throw a grenade or a smoke and that can kill you, and in zombies, V is not the best for knife. I would recommend to use a Xbox Controller when playing this game.\n\nGameplay (7.5/10)\nEven though I love zombies and maybe even multiplayer a little bit, but it gets very repetitive. Campaign is good, multiplayer is not popular and zombies are great, So don't expect the best.\n\nGraphics (9.5/10)\nIts great for Its time and still is today, the maps are highly detailed and explosions and other effects are good too\n\nReplay Value (8/10)\nZombies, Multiplayer, Campaign oh my! Like I said, all gamemodes are not the best, but you might like it!\n\nSummary\nOverall, some parts of this game is not great and the controls aren't that good, but there is a lot of greatness in this game, and there is certain mods for multiplayer or zombies, so go pick this game up in a sale, because 40 bucks is too high for this game.\n\n8/10\n","March 20","true","52.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That is what us PC players want. Not matchmaking, why won't you learn this lesson Acti/Treyarch/IW?\n\nThe single player for this game has all the usual hallmarks of a Call of Duty storyline, however the story has a few plot-holes but if you aren't over-analysing the story too much, you will find it a pleasant experience.\n\nThe multiplayer is really where it is at, fast paced and exciting. However there are some issues with the netcode and it isn't quite as polished from that perspective. The ability to control spectator auto-kick functionality on the servers would have been useful, however Treyarch have decided to limit all those capabilities on the ranked servers - a terrible idea.\n\nIf you are looking for a great server to play on - Check out the below group for the NORULES server details.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/norulescrew","December 11, 2011","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I definitely would recommend this game to anyone that enjoys action games! Game play is easy on the easy level which I like. Some games are so hard you have to really struggle to advance and that can be frustrating. Call of Duty games let you advance to enjoy all the levels of the games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCristianGuy/recommended/42700/","ThatCristianGuy","ThatCristianGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCristianGuy/","169 products in account","One of the best Call of Duty games out there! It has an amazing campaign, great multiplayer, and amazing zombie maps!\n\nHonestly I would have to say this: DON'T BUY THE DLC UNLESS YOU'RE INTO ZOMBIES! Don't get me wrong the Multiplayer maps are greta in this game. The entire game runs of dedicated servers for Multiplayer and most if not all the DLC servers run off the official Treyarch servers. So why is this a bad thing? NO ONE PLAYS ON THE TREYARCH SERVERS! It's sad really. If you're really that interested in playing the Multiplayer DLC maps then get it on console. Anyway, another problem with this game is that dedicated servers have a lot of stupid rules, a lot of Nuketown 24/7 servers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ admins for the most part. Another big problem is that not a lot of people play the Wager Matches (Gun Game, Sharpshooter, etc). In general it's pretty hard to find a match of Multiplayer due to the fact not a lot of people actually play the PC version of Black Ops anymore. Which is a shame considering this is one of my favorite COD games!\n\nAnyway enough of me talking negative, let's talk about all the postitives! For one thing, these have amazing and memoriable maps! They're pretty basic due to the fact the entire game is set around the cold war. Some maps you may recognize such as Launch, Nuketown, Firing Range, and Stadium. The guns feel great and are fun to use! And just about every server is a Ground War server so it makes it even more fun! The more people the better right? If I'm not mistaken, this is the first COD game to introduce controller support for the PC. I know. I know. Call of Duty: World at War had controller support by typing in console commands, (Honestly I'm not sure about Call of Duty: 4 Modern Warfare due to the fact I don't have the game as of making this review) but it wasn't as easy as Black Ops. Black Ops gives you the controller options right at the options menu easy as that. Sadly, if you played this game for a long time on console (not me) there is not auto-aim assist what so ever. It's easier to use the Keyboard anyway so whatever. One last thing I have to say is that this is the last Call of Duty game to allow mods. The mods are really fun in this game! There's a mod called Zombie Annihilation mod to pretty much you can play Infected in Black Ops, A reverse and Hardcore Gun Game, and many more! The mods are only for Multiplayer however and not for Zombies, but it's still fun to mess around with!\n\nOverall this game gets a 9/10. I highly recommend it!","May 20, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very fun shooter with decent maps, for the PC version alone, theres a server for everybody, regular no rules TDM/DOM, some weird modded server, or even a crouch tactical server. Zombies for black ops 1 was one of my favorites as well. The maps in zombies were open and had optional easter eggs to complete, had some good times on there but it can get a bit repetitive.\n\nOnly advice I give you when going into this game is to watch out for the community, there's cool people, but the majority are out there to make you angry or sad or potentially make death threats... heh\n\nI guess that goes for anything on the internet :/\n\n8/10","June 24, 2015","true","36.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Next is the gameplay the gameplay means most in my opinion so let me just say that it is amazing. I love the way it feels it feels smooth and It is amazing, now the price on the other hand its way too expensive.

Very fun shooter with decent maps, for the PC version alone, theres a server for everybody, regular no rules TDM/DOM, some weird modded server, or even a crouch tactical server. Zombies for black ops 1 was one of my favorites as well. The maps in zombies were open and had optional easter eggs to complete, had some good times on there but it can get a bit repetitive.\n\nOnly advice I give you when going into this game is to watch out for the community, there's cool people, but the majority are out there to make you angry or sad or potentially make death threats... heh\n\nI guess that goes for anything on the internet :/\n\n8/10","June 24, 2015","true","36.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCristianGuy/recommended/42700/","ThatCristianGuy","ThatCristianGuy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatCristianGuy/","169 products in account","One of the best Call of Duty games out there! It has an amazing campaign, great multiplayer, and amazing zombie maps!\n\nHonestly I would have to say this: DON'T BUY THE DLC UNLESS YOU'RE INTO ZOMBIES! Don't get me wrong the Multiplayer maps are greta in this game. The entire game runs of dedicated servers for Multiplayer and most if not all the DLC servers run off the official Treyarch servers. So why is this a bad thing? NO ONE PLAYS ON THE TREYARCH SERVERS! It's sad really. If you're really that interested in playing the Multiplayer DLC maps then get it on console. Anyway, another problem with this game is that dedicated servers have a lot of stupid rules, a lot of Nuketown 24/7 servers, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ admins for the most part. Another big problem is that not a lot of people play the Wager Matches (Gun Game, Sharpshooter, etc). In general it's pretty hard to find a match of Multiplayer due to the fact not a lot of people actually play the PC version of Black Ops anymore. Which is a shame considering this is one of my favorite COD games!\n\nAnyway enough of me talking negative, let's talk about all the postitives! For one thing, these have amazing and memoriable maps! They're pretty basic due to the fact the entire game is set around the cold war. Some maps you may recognize such as Launch, Nuketown, Firing Range, and Stadium. The guns feel great and are fun to use! And just about every server is a Ground War server so it makes it even more fun! The more people the better right? If I'm not mistaken, this is the first COD game to introduce controller support for the PC. I know. I know. Call of Duty: World at War had controller support by typing in console commands, (Honestly I'm not sure about Call of Duty: 4 Modern Warfare due to the fact I don't have the game as of making this review) but it wasn't as easy as Black Ops. Black Ops gives you the controller options right at the options menu easy as that. Sadly, if you played this game for a long time on console (not me) there is not auto-aim assist what so ever. It's easier to use the Keyboard anyway so whatever. One last thing I have to say is that this is the last Call of Duty game to allow mods. The mods are really fun in this game! There's a mod called Zombie Annihilation mod to pretty much you can play Infected in Black Ops, A reverse and Hardcore Gun Game, and many more! The mods are only for Multiplayer however and not for Zombies, but it's still fun to mess around with!\n\nOverall this game gets a 9/10. I highly recommend it!","May 20, 2014","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Otherwise you will get sick from playing te first parts of the maps and then die. There are no public matches on zombies.\n\nCo op Multiplayer is only TDM and FFA against bots. It has different leveling than the Multiplayer part of the game. The dificulty of the bots only makes their aim faster and at some point it feels like a normal MW3 game (full of cheaters with aim bot) however if you play with your friends against a horde of bots it is ridiculously fun.\n\nI am giving thumbs up because it has dedicated servers! But if I have to rate it I would give it 6/10 because the co op part apart from the zombies is very limited.\n\nHowever this is probably the only actually good Call of duty game.","May 31","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As a single player and not interested in the multi player aspect I'm really not enjoying it. Basically it's just run and gun, it's Serious Sam. It's chaos. Continuous shooting, noise and bullets. No clear aim of what to do next, yet you are on rails with your hand held along the way by your buddies. It's Duck Shoot with modern graphics. It's repetetive and boring. Gave up after a few missions. Wolfenstein The New Order did it so much better in every way!\nThe Call of Duty franchise is SO overhyped.

That's pretty much it in a nutshell.\n\nBefore playing through the campaign for the first time, I was pretty sceptic about it, but needless to say it blew those bad expectations away pretty quickly. It's packed with action at every single step and tells the story in a way that sucks you in like a high-wattage vacuum cleaner, which really was a pleasant surprise from Treyarch as I was expecting something more along the lines of World at War. I would recommend playing through it if you haven't done so yet, it's not going to eat so much of your time since it's Call of Duty, and there were quite a few memorable moments to justify it.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, the multiplayer comes with many improvements over Modern Warfare 2. The entire thing feels more balanced, requires more skill rather than grenade-launching your way to victory and while the killstreaks can feel overpowered at times, it's nowhere as bad. There's also this 'money system' that you use to purchase guns and custom emblems and whatnot - I myself haven't managed to find the actual purpose of it but if you're a fan of such things, it's cool. And, of course, the Zombies mode makes for loads of fun as well.\n\nOverall, it's a good game. Buy it if it's currently on sale or something. Truly don't go for the full price. Like really, no.

Play it on xbox or playstation. Don't bother with this version, it's horribly ported and has so many bugs and glitches that it's almost unplayable anymore.\n\nLeave it to Treyarch to lose interest in the toys that they make and let it break itself apart.\n\nThis game is amazing in it's own right, the campaign is lively and very well written, the multiplayer is exceptionally fun, and the zombies always gives that fun you could never replace.\n\nHowever, with the more recent times, Treyarch stopped caring about this game. It was one of the better and more successful games in their franchise yet they still chose to let it die. The zombies mode literally doesn't work anymore, you'll be sitting there for a few hours before you find an actual online match, and the private match doesn't even work so you can't play zombies with your friends like the good ol' days. All you can do is force your friend to bring his entire rig over to your house so you could HOPE that the LAN works.\n\nTHis has been a problem for what 2 years now? And Treyarch not only has said nothing about it, but continue to pump out garbage sequels instead of fixing the games that are actually good for their franchise.\n\n","January 4","false","52.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I think it is rather funny that Treyarch makes better Call of Duty titles than Infinity War. The story in this game is quite well done, with some exciting plot twists and great action/set peices. The mulitplayer is solid COD twitch shooting with some cool tack ons,  in addition to the great SIngleplayer and fun multiplayer the Zombies coop mode is also good fun with friends, in which up to 4 of your friends call fight endless waves of zombies with traps, and weapons its good stuff. The only downside is there are only 2 zombie maps for the standard game mode. The rest are 15 bucks a pop for the DLC map packs. Which is pretty insane how old the game is but Activision doesnt seem to like to price down their games even years after release. Hence why Call of Duty is 20 dollars...

No tactics at all! No suspense of the unknown!. No interactive game play, or intuitive involvement. Poor A.I. Enemies just run into you and you'll feel its like shooting clay pigeons! Too bad! No RPG elements to exercise wisdom & manage your resources,objectives & weapons. So disappointed with COD BO on all those accounts. World at war in just a new wrapper! rather poor show over all! But some like it that way- point and shoot. And YES  OVERPRICED and that's too without DLC'S...I Mean what was the point of charging dlc worth game price and that too u have to buy each and every dlc for each and every cod zombie maps...I can rather buy 40-50 games or i can gift the game to my friend instead of buying tons of dlc's for 6-7 maps only..\n\n\nHere are the pros : -\n\nSo what if the graphics are great? Game play matters more to me.Weapons are realistic. So? Cut scenes- fab! I wonder if there is more cinematics in this game than its game-play duration! Been eying this game for long, waited for the price to reduce. Hoped it would be better. The missions are plain and dull, sometimes with a timer or a specific goal, that's it! And durations are very short. Most of the time its like following the automation blindly as you fire and blaze from one check-point to another, at a break neck pace. Very linear and flat! If this is some one's concept of a good FPS, then sorry! We are not on the same page. Infact Crysis 3 and Ghost sniper 2 are better games when compared with this. So was the last installment of FEAR!\n\nOVERALL : -  Black Ops fails to live up to that hype generated by immature reviews ! Where is the edge? The over all game play is not so attractive. I do have plans to buy the next 2 installments but am having my doubts already about what those would offer against such hefty price tags. Pinning more hope on Wolfenstein-The new order.","March 23","false","35.1"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","57","4","7","2","1"

I enjoyed it as much as MW2.\n\nThis game was developed by Treyarch , instead of Infinity Ward. And Treyarch did really very good job with that game ! It is very diferent than the Modern Warfare and the older series. Graphicaly, this game have very good visuals, and they are better than MW3 (wich uses IW 4.0 since MW2) thankfully to the heavily modifed IW 3.0 engine and Demonware. But dont get fooled, thinking that it uses IW 3.0 the game will look like CoD 4 (MW1), and keep in mind : It`s heavily modifed + it uses second engine called Demonware .They maked the game in IW 3.0, because Treyarch have much aknowage on that engine, than IW 4.0\nI buyed this game because of the single-player not that much for MP. It`s really sad that many people are playing only the multiplayer, and they barely touched the single player.\n\nSo is it worth buying it ?\nDefinetly yes !","March 30, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Something about numbers. Who cares. I did, however, play a fair amount of Zombies with 2 friends. And it was a lot of fun. We killed tons of zombies. We sometimes struggled to efficiently co-operate, but put our differences aside and found our way to waves near 30-40. It was both satisfying in term of team work and shooting zombies. Pack a punch and perk drinks are ingredients that just make the mode tastier. Nonetheless, we missed a pause button because after 30 waves you often want to go to the head. Or to bed. Anyhow, it is a time consuming mode, where only little mistakes can cost you the round. But overall, most fun I had in Call of Duty Black Ops.","November 27, 2013","true","85.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Weapons are, for most, well balanced and so are the different perks and abilities you unlock. 15 prestige levels that will keep you competing with your friends for the highest title.\n\nFast paced action in an award winning first person shooter, with tons of unlockables and an interesting community, as far as clan related gaming goes. Multiplayer games can be annoying when playing with random players as this game makes people rage all around the world for someone with skill will easily FACEPUNCH someone who doesn't have any.\n\nSecond instance of Nazi Zombies with over 10 maps available and an insane amount of secrets to uncover and techniques to develop. If you don't buy Black Ops for its campaign or its multiplayer, you need to buy it for its zombie mode.\n\nP.S. Try a knife/sniper only server if you ever get bored.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nSingle Player: 5/10 The Campaign could've been much better\nMultiplayer: 9/10 Online maps are nice and loadout is cool. Zombie is an amazing mode which got improved a lot in Black Ops\nGraphics: 9/10 Very visualy apealing\nCommunity: 2/10 Childish players, lack of official mod tools, no mapping tools\n--------------------------------------------------------------","September 19, 2013","true","52.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LouieBee/recommended/42700/","LouieBee","LouieBee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LouieBee/","2282 products in account","I'll summarise Call of Duty Black Ops by highlighting the important points. Yes Black Ops has a strong cinematic singleplayer, with better characterisation and plot than World At War. Yes, Black Ops has made an intricate improvement to the zombies  mode, adding depth and the amount it has to offer. And yes, Black Ops on PC DOES have dedicated servers which eliminates the need for matchmaking and host transition. Yet despite this, the game's no better than COD 4. It does nothing new for the COD series, murdering the quality of the weapons, killstreaks and general balancing of COD's multiplayer. The COD points system is too shallow for what it promises and once again Call of Duty has a deadly short single-player lifespan too. The nail in the coffin for many though would be the outrageous system spec required for the game to run properly. Even a mid-range PC would struggle to play Black Ops without stuttering a chunk load and this is unacceptable. Get Battlefield Bad Company 2 instead.","July 8, 2011","false","9.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Emphasis on WAS. Now it's impossible to play multiplayer, unless you find playing against bots with access to only 3 classes fun. I don't know why they made it so you can only play on other's servers for multiplayer, but it absolutely ruined it. The only reason you should buy this old game is for the zombies mode, and campaign I guess. But really, zombies is the only redeeming factor the this waste of money. Don't buy this and expect to play multiplayer, it's terrible.","January 7","false","2.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
