This is styled very much like those games but there is no character progression, no army/party building, no skills, etc. TBS game maybe, rpg definitely not.\n\nThis is really a puzzle game using some mechanics from tactics style games. Think of it like playing challenge mode in chess games. There is a board setup and you basically have to figure out a strategy to solve it.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/TERQn7kUAjo\n\nGeneral graphics/audio: Very barebones, you basically get to toggle fullscreen, lighting & shadows (I have no idea why in the hell anybody would turn off lighting and shadows unless they were trying to run this on a rig from 20 years ago), music and sfx. The game is locked to 60fps but I'm not even sure 60 is necessary considering what is happening.\n\nStory: Somewhat amusing story which I did not expect at all. I don't mean an actual plot because there is barely a story, there aren't really characters and stuff but the overarching narrative basically makes fun of tactics style games. Every couple of centuries sky-people who aren't really sky people go into a world where everybody is getting along and just makes them all fight on these square floating islands for their amusement. It's accompanied with little bits of text at the start of every level that are somewhat amusing.\n\nGameplay: Very straightforward tactics-style mechanics thrown into a puzzle. Units move on a grid, they have basic stats and attack stuff, enemies have movement preferences and if you mouse over them it shows exactly where the enemy will go. Some boards have a very specific way to beat and is basically trial and error. Most of the time a wrong move will ruin everything and you gotta restart or hit the turn back button. One mechanic I'd definitely recommend turning off is the one where when enemies attack your units it pauses the game and you have to click for the attack to go through. Since you can't press the turn back button this serves no real purpose, units move  quickly and there's no actual need to see when the enemy attacks, if it does and you didn't know it was coming odds are you f*cked up.\n\nMy main complaint would be the weird difficulty curve(?). With most puzzle games you expect it to start easy and then slowly and consistently ramp up until it is ridiculously hard. With Monstro the difficulty goes up and down, every once in a while you hit a hard level but in between them are levels that are not only much easier but also don't require a specific way to solve (a lot of the easier ones just require you to gather your guys up and wait for the enemy to walk in and get slaughtered).\n\nOverall: Would recommend as a casual strategy/puzzle game. If you are looking for a new Tactics Ogre/Final Fantasy Tactics then this is definitely not for you unfortunately. There is decent enough value for the money, The first Human wing took me about an hour and there is a monster wing and a ++ wing for both races.","December 4, 2015","true","2.3"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/369310/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5484 products in account","I thoroughly enjoyed Monstro the little bit I played of it, while I wouldn't necessarily call it a traditional tactical rpg, it is a very retro throwback type of experience.  The game isn't really styled after the newer tactical roleplaying or strategy games.  You don't form parties, you don't mix and match units to find the best possibly combination for each battle.  From the outside looking in the game may appear to be a bit too old school..\n\nIn spite of the fact that it's not your typical strategy game, a lot of thought and careful planning is involved with each and every new battle you face.  You'll be forced to discover the correct order to attack, the right way to move your characters around to best strike and destroy the enemy.  This type of game is really geared towards someone who thinks outside the box, if you go all out and blitz each enemy you'll find yourself on the losing end time after time after time..  Although like they said, if you fail, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and try again.. try try again.. Trust me you'll be trying again with this game..\n\nGameplay -\nThe game plays like your typical strategy game, the characters move on a grid, you can move so many spaces and pick a few limited options in regards to your enemies.  The main game play element is trying to figure out how to clear the stage, often times hitting with just a single character won't be enough to kill the enemy, other times the enemy character may obliterate you with a single turn leaving you running around with no chance of winning.\n\nPro's\nFairly challenging,\na hybrid mix of strategy and puzzle game\nwell put together game\n\nCon's\nA bit frustrating in some areas\nTutorial leaves alot to be desired\nAlot of potential but the barebones nature of the product was kind of detracting.\n\nRecommendation\nI'd recommend this game to fans of strategy and puzzle games, being a hybrid of the two suits this game really well and will stimulate lovers of both genres.  The game has quite a bit of challenge, although kind of limited on the replay value as once you know how to solve the battles not much changes.   The game has enough to offer so that it'll keep even the most seasoned gamer on his toes.","April 19","true","3.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/369310/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","I think I’ve never played a game as Monstro: Battle Tactics. This game is best described as a mixture of turn based tactical battles with a puzzle game, in the sense that you have to find the correct way and order to take out the enemy units or complete a certain objective without getting your troops killed.\n\nThe story of the game is presented to you in the form of an introductory cutscene and via little text windows at the beginning of every mission. The game takes place in Ludus, a place where monsters,mythical creatures and humans live in peace but once in every hundred years the Skygods summon some sort of floating islands, with perfectly shaped squares, in order to humans and monsters fight among themselves for the amusement of the gods.\n\nCore gameplay:\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple and easy to understand but, however, this doesn’t mean that the game doesn’t offer a challenge, it is quite the opposite. On each mission you’ll have control over one or more units, and usually your objective is either to slay all enemy units or to eliminate a certain enemy. The loss condition, of course, is not to loose all your units. Sounds simple enough, right? This is where Monstro: Battle Tactics really shines, it takes a simple and easy to learn gameplay formula and makes it challenging and hard by turning the fights and the levels themselves into puzzles of some sort. What I mean by this is that you’re able to move your units as you see fit, but most often the not, if you don’t plan ahead and find the correct order to attack and which enemies to go after first, you’ll end up loosing pretty quickly. Still, no need to worry about restarting the level since the game kindly offers you an “undo” function.\n\nThe game adds some variety to this by putting you against different types of enemies with different stats and by putting down some traps and movable and destructible walls. Your units also have their own stats, and some might even have specializations which increases a certain stat of a given unit. It is also in this sense that each mission is somewhat of a puzzle, because you have to compare your units stats with the enemies and figure out if you have what it takes to take the enemy down before it takes you.\n\nPros:Nice and clean pixel art style\nReally good sountrack\n5 different campaigns, each with hand crafted levels\nHilarious and funny dialogue\nSimple and easy to learn but yet challenging gameplay\nCons:Dialogue can be somewhat confusing to understand at times\nStory could be a bit more developed\nSome missions have a steep learning curve\nCould use more unit variety\nVerdict:\nDespite the cons I’ve mentioned above, Monstro: Battle Tactics manages to keep things varied and interesting enough to make me want to keep playing it. As someone who has never really delved much into tactical RPGs, I must say I like the way this game mixes some aspects of that genre with some light elements of puzzle solving. Therefore, if you’re a fan of light puzzle games, turn based strategy in general or are just looking for something unique with a twist, I recommend you check this one out!","April 20","true","4.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It reminds me of Desktop Dungeons except with many evolved mechanics. I enjoyed it's graphics, music and gameplay. You could say it's a puzzle game clothed as a tRPG. I definitely recommend it for it's price if you enjoy spending evenings solving increasingly complex puzzles with innovative mechanics. Especially if you also enjoy old school rpg-esque pixel graphics that are in this games case a treat for the eyes.

It kind of gives a Chess vibe, because you have to be very careful on when and where you move your units and when to attack.\n\n+ Very challenging, each stage you have to play smart or you will surely fail\n+ Interesting Mechanics, both sides heal a small portion of HP each turn causing you to try to take out the enemy quickly or surround them for quick kills.\n+ An "Undo" button, which lets you quickly go back instead of restarting the mission\n+ A large variety of unique maps, that changes the tide of battle\n+ The graphics are well drawn\n\n- A pretty strange and silly story (Something like "Humans and Monsters were at peace, then sky-people came and told them to fight or die)\n- The Introduction / Tutorial was very long and boring (not shown in the video above)\n- I felt like there should have been more animations and abilities\n- A small selection of characters/units","January 31","true","4.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
