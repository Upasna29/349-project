There's also a sense that this is probably a much better game on the Wii, since that system actually requires you to use your arms like a ninja.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thranx/recommended/13000/","Thranx","[TG] Thranx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Thranx/","1823 products in account","A simple reflex/response tie based mini-game game, Ninja Reflexes fails to interest beyond simple attemps to improve one's score.  They slowly introduce you to variations on 6 mini games, unlocking them as you achieve new "belts."  At each level, you must complete the same minigames you did on the previous belt with slight increases in difficulty along with a new challenge modification for that level.\n\nIf this is some kind of brain/reflex training game, then I can see some merit, but as just a game to play an have fun, it fails in that regard.  It's too simply, too repetitive and the controls never quite feel right for a few of the games. Targeting and then throwing ninja stars just doesn't work with a mouse.\n\nI can't really recommend this game, even under $1.\n\nVisuals 3\nGameplay 2\nSlant 2\n\n\nOverall : 23","February 28, 2014","false","3.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

It's somewhat repetitive and has no plot. However, speaking as a martial artist, it's actually quite good! It trains hand-to-eye coordination in a way that is extremely easily translated to the rest of your life (unlike some fps which develop incorrrect reflex responses) and it is not based in a hack-slash mentality. It's the best game-form of basic skill training I've ever found.","February 1, 2013","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's enjoyment wears thin and the feeling of "more of the same, only a little harder this time" is unavoidable.  This can be minimized by short sessions, which is probably how it was meant to be played anyway.  Another gripe is that multiplayer seems to be discontinued, just as the dev's website is also nowhere to be found.  This breaks almost half of the game's achievements and reduces its overall value considerably.  However, if your expectations don't rise above a series of fun and unique minigames that test your twitch skills, then you should be happy with Ninja Reflex.  Just wait until its on sale...","January 22, 2015","true","12.5"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
