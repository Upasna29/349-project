This game is dreadful. It has poor grainy resolution, horrible voice acting and tormenting ears-piercing background music. Sherlock has an irritating nasal British accent and his remarks are obvious or silly statements, The puzzles are quite easy, but not all of them make sense, and it's easy to miss items. And why make a puzzle game from first person view? It was a bad idea, especially with the oversensitive mouse (obviously, this game was made for mechanical  mouses).\n\nAnd the game crashes, too.\n\nThis game takes place in the 19th century, and apparently it was made back then, as well.\n\nAvoid this game at all costs. 3/10.","May 6, 2015","false","0.9"," 26 of 32 people (81%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","81","26","32","5","0"

And yeah, I know this game is old but that is not a very good excuse.\nYou can only play it at fullscreen (in which everything is pixelated and hard to look at - and I only have a 13'' screen, which is considerably small), you can't alt+tab away from the game unless you're in for restarting it (you can't even access the Steam layer) and it happens a lot that the game crashes at cutscenes (that stuff you spent the last hour working on? Lost!).\nIf that is not enough to harden your way through, items are very very well hidden, which is not a bad point per se, but I found they were just overly hidden for it to be fun. I don't know whether this was made on purpose (since Sherlock's primary skill is observing it makes sense to make it hard to "see" useful stuff) or not.\nAlso, the puzzles are really difficult (difficult enough they're no longer fun) and most of the time will require you take paper and pen (since you can't alt+tab out of the game) and spend some long time on them, which could be fun if you like it (like I do), but, in this case, it just isn't.\n\nYes, the story is fine, the way you can get letters (backstory) is well thought of, moving through rooms/levels is a very good mechanic, but the bad points weight, by far, much more than the good points.\nSo, unless you enjoy very difficult and time-consuming games, don't spend your money on this.\nIf you get this in a SH bundle and need to check it out just because you're a fan, don't be afraid to have a walkthrough ready on your phone!","April 25, 2014","false","6.8"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

Moving around and picking up evidence is a total pixel hunt, and the game as a whole handles poorly. It's incredibly easy to get stuck because the game wants you to do some random illogical interaction to move on which you usually find by just clicking on everything until something happens. Dying and end of level cutscenes crash the game on windows 7. The voice acting is so bad it's actually pretty funny. The story was almost acceptable, but Holmes' customary explanation of the mystery at the end was badly done and I couldn't understand it.

The pseudo-3D environments having been design for smaller monitor resolutions are pixelated on today's larger and wider resolutions, this results in making the already hidden objects in the game harder to find by being unable to clearly see them. Also it is not stable on modern systems as I had several crash to desktop's while playing the game. Thankfully they are predictable as they usually occurred during cutscenes and with saving before solving a puzzle little progress would be lost. The puzzles in the game are very challenging and added the fact there is timed segments and puzzles that result in Sherlock Holmes death if you get them wrong. This game is a real challenge and should only be reccomended to adventure game fanatics.

It started in windowed mode and there's no option ingame. I had a few crash loading the 3rd level, the 5th level, and the menu after final credit rolls but everything seems to be solved by setting the Win XP SP3 compatibility, or by skipping the cutscenes.\nThis game takes you inside a mansion where you can see in First person view and you may freelook simply pointing your cursor to the sides of the screen. You move and interact with the classic Point and click system, so nothing particular or new in the gameplay, actually it's pretty minimalist, as you only use your mouse with its left button. Unfortunately there's no way to examine items unless you pick them up from your inventory as nothing shows when you hover on them through the inventory, nor there's a specific function. It's not like you really need it in the game but it surely would have helped a bit...\n\n+++PROs+++ STORY. Actually the story is interesting. As you move on you get more and more clues and notes that somehow destroy your certainties and premises. I can't say more to prevent any kind of spoilers but I appreciated the plot. The final scene shows a classic Sherlock moment where he explains all the presents what really happened.\nMUSIC. I kind of liked the music you hear in each level, I appreciated the compositions.---CONs--- GRAPHIC.  I know it has its age and it's a simple adventure but I really have to say that the graphic is very very poor and low detailed.\nMUSIC & AUDIO. Unfortunately hearing the same music abrutly interrupted then restarting again for the whole level is really alienating. Besides that, some parts have very bad leveled volumes, and sometimes some sound or speeches are clipping. (though this happened rarely. Except for the first music track which crackled every time it finish to play again)\nSTEAM OVERLAY. Another game that doesn't support the Steam Overlay...\nSETTINGS. The game started windowed and there were no options to set, nor for the graphic nor for audio (music, effects and speech levels)\nINTERFACE. As a point & click game the interface is very important. Unfortunately the hot zones (zones that change cursor suggesting movement or actions) sometimes are too specific forcing you to search too long through the screen in the direction you want to move to find out later that the hot zone is really limited and lightly dislocated. Besides that, sometimes it's really hard to understand or see items you can pick or interact with. Not to mention a less important but still annoying bug that shows the wrong cursor icon when you interact with items and instead of restoring the defaul icon or changing to another secific one it stays the previous (and now wrong) one.\nSHERLOCK'S & OTHERS VOICE. Well, it's not really about the voice, nor the accent. Actually it's his tone that doesn't convince me, as sometimes is really too harsh... And also Dr. Watson's voice sounds kind of... a parody...","March 10","true","5.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

To be honest, i like this featue and in this game i never had a " find the hotspot" game inside. But on the other hand the graphics are pretty bad, well okay its from 2002, but still its very pixelated etc. You never interact with other people, its more like already said, l an escape room game where you solve riddle after riddle to get into the next room. Its pretty hard to figure out what you have to do, even if its very easy to find all necessary items, but very hard to use them actually, since the graphics dont allow you insight mostly on what to do. But they are well, pretty logical . I had not that often troubles to solve them.\nThe story really sucks. I forgot what was the story about pretty quickly. Not that i didnt payed attention, the story didnt actually matter that much. The atmoshpere is actually pretty good, but the main character is giving comments on the current situations like he is watching it from far away. Example: a big mummy comes out of a room(more like a cheap jumpscare) and he comments it as his life isnt in danger at all.\nThe voiceover is bad, but in many different languages.\nI heard about having crashes, etc. I didnt had any but you have been warned.\nI actually managed to finish the game in 4.9 hours, but its just because i stucked at 1-2 of the last riddles for a while.\nRecommended? No not alone, but in the complete collection, yes. If you like very good riddles then give the games a shot, since they are more likely realistic and logical than in other point&click games. The game itself is about a little below average. You can play it, atleast the riddles are good.\nSo i give the game thumbs up to buy the whole pack.

It's definitely the worst of the bunch.\n\nFirst of all, you can't change the resolution. The entire game looked blurry. Sherlock's voice acting is passable, but everyone else's is laughably bad. (Also, Sherlock mispronounces "laudanum," which bothers me more than it should.)\n\nThis game commits the worst adventure game sins: pixel hunting, puzzles that are either mindless busywork or completely inscrutable, and unintuitive use of inventory items.\n\nThe game doesn't explain the rules or objectives of many puzzles. For instance, one puzzle requires you to place exactly four liters of water on a depression. You're not told that's the amount you need, which, considering there's no earthly reason that putting more weight on it wouldn't work, should really be included. One puzzle is a nonogram, something I had never seen before, and the game gave no instructions. The final puzzle is solved by randomly clicking things in your inventory, with no rhyme or reason to why that item should go there.\n\nIf you bother to play to the end, you find out that the solution to the mystery doesn't make sense and is about as ridiculous as it could get. My suggestion to anyone interested in the Sherlock Holmes games is to pass on this one and get another.","December 14, 2013","false","7.7"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

The graphics are shoddy and the animations are, well, bad. The dialogue is putrid and very dry, which seems very unlike Doyles' Holmes. The sound of the game is quite good, although the dubbing is dull and lacking of any real... Character.\n\nMost of the game is your standard point and click "find hidden item, use X with Y to do Z and then maybe find something useful". There was a time where I had more patience with that sort of game, but this just seems needlessly complicated. Find all the pieces to be able to find the puzzle, so you can do the puzzle and move on to the next room. Boring. Nothing is really complex or challenging - at least once you've figured out what you actually need to pick up.\n\nSpeaking of things to pick up, that's one point I really like.. Some other reviews noted this as a bad thing, but I really love that the items you need don't "stand out" more than any other. That philosophy is brilliant, and, had there been fewer things to pick up, it really helped the game along with regards to immersion.\n\nThere's not much else to say about this, really. The game is dull and features way too many "This door is locked" or "I need something to open this" lines. I'm a big fan of Doyle's Holmes, and that Holmes would, quite likely, just have bypassed those locks in some ingenious way - not just looked around for a bit and hope to stumble upon the key.","October 5, 2014","false","1.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'm giving this one the thumbs down as much as I want it to be a thumbs up because of so many speed humps that actually interrupt the flow of the game. Probably the first thing to mention is the continuous crashing, particularly at the end of cut scenes and chapter ends. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE OFTEN. I cannot reiterate that point enough. Much frustration comes after completing a devilish puzzle to have the game crash and redo it ALL over again. However, these crashes can be overcome with the good ole ESC key, for the most part.\nThe second most disappointing element is the visuals in relation to the difficulty of the game. I appreciate the age of a game and God knows how many adventure games I have played over the years but to find a hairpin, for example, on a floor that frankly is blurry and the object resembles a smudge is poor form. Being penalised via having to consult a walkthrough so often for locating objects is not on. On the plus side the story is engaging enough to make you restart again and again and finish it but it feels a chore to 'get through'. The voice acting/recording is atrocious (knowing in the future this becomes its' main selling point) and the dialogue itself is poorly written. After almost no interaction with characters the game finishes with a huge cutscene that wraps it all up with way too much assumption and frankly insults the gamer who has been there all the way by solving the whole thing and saying goodnight with silent credits. Fans of the games NEED to play this one to experience the whole saga but this one cannot have it's age to blame because in its era there were many other adventure games that got this formula right with less frustration.

As the mystery unravels piece by piece, the player must want to continue solving in order to find out more.\n- Joy in actually solving the puzzles. This is unlike most adventure games where the story is everything and the puzzles merely a means of achieving it. Sherlock Holmes found joy in the process of solving the mystery, so it makes sense that in a game which captures the feel of it, the puzzles must be as fun as the story.\n\nUnfortunately, this game failed on both fronts but as the first game in a series, I see immense promise in them achieving the second goal. I've heard that they make the "hidden objects" much more obvious, so that it's less a hidden objects game, and the puzzles get progressively more elegant. They become less, "Can you guess what the developers want you to do before you get frustrated and look it up" and more difficult but solvable.\n\nBut the first game is not there yet. I ended up just looking up the LP after I got halfway through and frustrated so that I could follow snippets of story that may seep into the next game.\n\nAfter watching the LP, I still have no idea what actually happened in the story.

This game has really dated graphic capability, game mechanics, and puzzles that only the true Sherlock Holmes could solve. The PC version of this game requires external software which is very obnoxious because the graphical issues are only mostly solved. Even though the first person point of view would be a smart move to see everything Sherlock Holmes would see was poorly implimented. Instead of a FPS shooter it was more of a point and click adventure to move around a room.\n\nWith the frustration to get the game running, playing the game, and seeing the game. I suggest you either find someone to play a different version or buy this on a sale if you really want the complete experiance of Frogware's excellent series.

This game is a pixel hunting nightmare and the clues to any puzzles you must solve are generally unhelpful, so many of the unintuitive puzzles are solved through trial and error.  This is a very short game but you spend the second half of the game going over areas that were already explored.  The only upside to this game was the voice acting and dialogue.  Both are so bad that you will find yourself chuckling from time to time.

Frogwares' first, the game with which they started their succesful SH series, so of some minor "historical" value for the genre - and yet a letdown in most ways... Released in 2002, this game looks dated even for that year. Looking around might be smooth, but moving is clunky, and sometimes an exercise in pixel hunting, which is hardly a recommendation... Inventory management is annoying and slow, and (unless I'm mistaken) no usage of keyboard doesn't help.\n\nThe setting is, yeah, SH meets Egypt (with a bunch of other clichéd influences & touches), quite uninspired, as is, more or less, the story (Doyle was likely turning in his grave because  of this one), along with voice acting, which goes from "so bad it's good" to "meh"... Sherlock himself, apart from being a Frankenstein of Sherlock clichés has "accent issues", failing to convince or interest. Music? I was just playing Transport Tycoon Deluxe before this, and the quality is eerily similar at some points... I honestly didn't expect almost midi level music in a commercial (if budget) 2002 game.\n\nSo, OK, there are all too often great adventure games hidden behind an unimpressive technical side. Is it here too? No. The puzzles are (so far, I only got to the beginning of the 4th chapter) as uninspiring as they can be. Generic slider puzzles? Check. The "5l and 3l buckets & you need 4l" puzzle? Check... Illogical / obscure solutions? Check. Poor & simple puzzles have likely been obscured by, in some cases, a complete lack of hints on what you're supposed to achieve, some backtracking, and extreme pixelhunting in a 360 environment, requiring from you, sometimes, to go from place to place and pass your cursor everywhere in hope it changes. And timed puzzles... They are a personal peeve of mine, but they're quite badly and annoyingly exectuted. Like someone figured it was damn too easy on its own, wasn't capable of creating interesting puzzles and just made it harder by making it more annoying.\n\nBasically, it's a dated, generic, dull first person adventure game. It's amazing how much Frogwares have grown and improved since then... but this one you should avoid unless you're a completist & hardcore Sherlock Holmes fan.","June 30, 2014","false","6.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It does admirably well as far as most mouse-click, item-find games go, and the central mystery is decent enough. There's just a few outstanding issues it faces. One, finding the correct items is unbearable, not because of any sense of ingenuity or cleverness, but because the graphics are shoddy, and necessary objects can often times just blend in to their surroundings. Two, once you do manage to claim all the right inventory, what to do with them, and where to put them is painfully simple. Three, while the game is no difficult in the sense that it will not test your mettle, it is needlessly complicated by timed sections and other hoops to jump through that aren't properly explained. This combined with occasional crashes makes forward progress slightly more difficult.

Probably only bought in a bundle with the other games, so just skkip this one, as it is the first one released, and move on to 'Silver Earring'.\n\nThis is an old game, but it really doesn't justify how bad it is.\nThe graphics are old, the animations are clunky, and a scary mummy just ends up looking dumb and funny moving around. The poor graphics also ruins the enjoyment of searching for things. Most of it is pixel hunting, trying to find a hotspot that's a slightly different type of grainy than the place it's at. The game is stuck in window mode.\n\nWhat annoyed me the most is probably the camera angles. When you wanted to get to one part of the room to another, you might have to sidestep to one side, then go to the place you want to go, which makes moving around annoying as you have to search for the right paths. It also sometimes had places to lean down which was I could only find with a guide when it was needed.\n\nThe game crashes A LOT. Save OFTEN as every time (at least for me) I got to a failstate, it also crashed my game. Which makes the game a bit more realistic than it needs to be. (Also save because there are failstates, even if the game should not crash).\n\nAlso, Sherlock Holmes speaks with an American accent. Just. Why?\n\nSome of the puzzles are decent, but as they are in no way explained what you are even trying to do, it gets frustrating getting a solution. Some of the puzzle solving design is just terrible; at one point you have to 'write' two decently lengthy sentences and you do this by picking the letter up with a mouse, dragging it to the right spot and should you misclick or pick up the wrong letter, you have to start all over again. This puzzle is timed, because of course.\n\nPersonally I did like the story, but it wasn't good enough to get me to even finish the game. I'm normally a completist, but this just isn't worth it. Look it up on youtube or find some synopsis if you must, but the story is luckily not relevant to the rest of the games, so you should need to to keep playing the rest of the bundle, which is mostly really good.","April 21","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

For an old game, the least they could do is to improve the graphic texture, it's appalling on high res screens.\n\nThe other problem is the control. Although it's simply point and click with only your mouse. When you have a high spec pc expect near uncontrollable mouse movement. The pointer moves so fast, it's like you would on FPS you have to be accurate. Moving around the place is frustrating at times when you wish they would just simply have something/anything that gives you quick access to rooms instead of moving you pointer accurately just to click to move.\n\nThis is compounded by the fact that some levels have a time limit. Imagine that you're in a life/death stage and you need to find objects to save yourself. But the pointer moves so fast, it's terrible that you also have to move you pointer ever so gently just to access the inventory or the menu. Yes, there's no shortcut keys. It's atrocious that while you can't see the item that you're looking for, very well, you need to be accurate. Oh, and there is a puzzle near the end, where you have to be accurate, gently and slowly, but there's a time limit in that entire level! Oh for the love of..! *Breathe*\n\nFor a point and click adventure game and Sherlock Holmes for that matter; you would think that you would go and find clues and solve mysteries through deduction, not using items just to get you from A to B of clues. It's like playing an escape game.\n\nAs for the puzzles... What a joke! It's either mind-numbing or pure frustration. I am definitely disappointed, if not by the logic then definitely the requirement of finesse with you hand. Even if you set your mouse speed, it will make a bit of difference, but it will annoy you if it moves too slow for you to move to a different room.\n\nFor the other aspect of this game. The music is dreary and the voice acting, rubbish! Even some horribly dubbed anime sounded better than this actor voicing Sherlock Holmes. It is an insult to the English character.\n\nYou're better off just watch the entire game on youtube and then add this game to your category of completed games, because this is simply not worth it no matter the price.","March 28, 2014","false","3.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

If it ever goes on special, it's still a questionable game.\nSo, this game was made a long time ago, which explains its quality.\nSo, if you're into classic puzzles with little to no direction to the next part, sure, this is for ye.\nBut if you're like me, and prefer the finer arts of "Holmes vs. Ripper", "Holmes Awakened" or "Holmes: Nemesis", than this is most certainly not for you.\nHaving said that, let's get straight into it.\n\nSo, apparently your cousin wants you to solve her father's disappearance or something like that.\nSounds reasonable, until you find out Watson will not be there to help you.\nImmediately, I think one of two thoughts:\n- "Lazy programmers want to save on character models"\n- "Builds suspense with only one character"\n\nThe main rant is the puzzles.\nA lot of the time, you will ask yourself "Great, I've done that part. What now?"\nAnd a lot of the time, you will be bumbling around, searching desperately for clues, and then realising in the darkness was a cloth or related object you had to pick up.\nEven the very first puzzle, I nearly gave up, because the puzzle itself was that hard to find.\n\nNavigation is another weird aspect of the game. You click where there is a hand, and you go there.\nProblem is, I find this restricts a lot of the playability. If I want to walk around a room, I have to find a place where I can go to, the screen changes and I have to shift my screen view to where I wanted to go initially.\nBasically, really clunky navigation system. It gets better in "Holmes & the Silver Earring", but MUCH better in the later games.\n\nAnd sometimes navigation actually becomes a painful, recurring puzzle in itself.\nHere's an excerpt of my thought process not far from the start of Level 3:\n\n"Okay, I've got 2 keys and there's 2 doors. Hm, seems simple enough."\n*tries both keys for both doors. None work*\n"Well, let's take a look around then for more keys..."\n*finds drawer, requiring 2 keys*\n"Great, this must be where I put these keys"\n*tries both keys, fails*\n"Fine, where is that last key..."\n*spends half an hour trying to get under a table*\n"OKAY, I've got 3 keys, and 2 I can use to open the drawer. Sigh"\n*tries the 2 keys, drawer explodes and I lose the game*\nYeah, that death animation doesn't make me feel any better about playing the game.\n\nCharacter development is barely present, since you only ever meet about 3 important characters in the game.\nA lot of indirect development is through the readings in the game, but it's just banter for the end explanation.\nSometimes useful for solving puzzles, though.\n\nInterface is awful. I mean, no hotkeys? Come on. I guess for a game of its age, maybe acceptable.\nBut still, I do want to read my clues while in a puzzle.\nAnd the voice acting for Holmes sounds like "an American with his nose blocked". Maybe it was intended?\n\nSo, is there anything remotely good about it, in my books?\nWell, the whiskey object looks like a cheap Jack Daniel's bottle from Google Images.\nBut, I will say the most fun part about the game is going into the Steam files and changing some of the printed dialogue to make Holmes say silly things. It's a text file called 'msg' or something related to 'messages'.\nSo you can make Holmes say "Ah, nuts. Another lousy puzzle" or "WATSON! I NEED YOU! *sobs*". Good times.\n\nOverall, I can only give it a 4/10. Weak, but if you dig this kind of game style, good for you.\nBut It was certainly the worst waste of 10 hours of my time so far.","December 16, 2014","false","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That said, this is certainly a game that does not stand up in time. That's what you get with compressed video/images though. Pixelated, artifacted, and more. It looks like utter garbage and makes it that much more difficult to tell where objects or clickable items are.\n\nBeyond that, some of the puzzles here are utterly nonsensical. Use a cane to prod open a hunting trophy. Find a fork under the carpet in the middle of a hallway. And the complete pixel-hunting precision that some of these require are beyond frustrating. Why do I need all of the items to begin this puzzle? Why are half of these items so hard to find? The satisfaction of a puzzle game is NOT finding items, it's discovering how to use them.\n\nIn-addition, this game has a huge problem with crashing, not to mention ways to set you up for failure. I got to a point where I had accidentally saved after a point where I could no longer progress, and the only way to fix it was to go back almost an hours-worth of gameplay to restart it. I say, "No thank you, I'm good".\n\nI would consider myself a huge fan of puzzle/adventure/point'n'clicks. But god, this one just nails everything that makes this tedious.

The graphics and interface are really dated but servicable.

While it makes absolutely no sense storywise (which is par for the course in this sort of game), it was the good kind of brain teaser I spent about an hour on and quite enjoyed, but the whole time I had to deal with:\n*Unweildy mouse control, since I couldn't control graphical settings or mouse sensitivity;\n*No explanation as to what I was actually meant to do;\n*Poor feedback from the game to let me know I was on the right track;\n*The puzzle resetting if you exit out of it; and of course\n*A countdown timer, because of course.\n\nSome things you can try to blame on it being dated, but most of this comes down to lazy design.

Basically, the player clicks around with the mouse to interact with the 3D environment, to turn around, to move. There's no free movement. The greatest challenge of the greatest detective ever is apparently to figure out what the low-resolution graphics are supposed to represent: what of the stuff is actually clickable and what is just some obscure mess. This difference can be found out by panning the mouse on top of everything and seeing if the pointer changes. Its not even clear where you can click to move, without doing this panning. The inventory handling is also terribly clumsy. If this wasn't all, on my Windows 7 the game reliably crashes on each alt-tab.\n\nThe mystery of the mummy might have been a nice game to play in its time, but because of its technical problems its no use to go to the actual content, and I wouldn't recommend it for the modern age.\n","July 4, 2015","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you get it via the Sherlock Holmes Collection, you don't miss much if only playing the two first levels or skipping  the game completely.\n\nSound: The music is okay, especially the track in level two is quite catchy, but there is only one track on infinite repeat per level, making playing one level 10+ minutes in one go a bit dull.\nThe voice acting is terrible, though. Both when it comes to most of the game's voice actors themselves as well as to the rather amateurish recording quality.\n\nGraphics: Mystery of the Mummy uses a Myst-like 3D-ego-perspective with pre-determined points-of-view. It does look worse than the ten years older Myst, though. Washed-out brown and grey tones are dominant, in later levels smoke, which is basically illustrated by a transparent grey layer above everything else, makes this even worse. To be fair, Myst had static frames while Mummy allows the player to look around with the mouse freely in its 'frames'. The possibility to look around freely is implemented badly, though, seriously hampering gameplay.\n\nGameplay: Surprisingly for a Sherlock Holmes game there are only very few logic based puzzles. It has ome stereotypical adventure puzzles: f.ex. the old 'get a key from the other side of the door with a pointy item and a pice of paper' trick makes a return and it has the infamous sliding puzzle (twice!).\nUnfortunately most of the puzzles consist solely of finding and combining the correct items. The free camera together with the washed out graphics make those puzzles utterly frustrating. Making places in the gameworld that Sherlock can interact with more apparent would have helped making this game a lot more enjoyable. Instead you are supposed to find things like a tiny hairpin (seriously, it was only barely visible after I *knew* where it is) in a room with lots of broken stuff and junk in it, without even knowing what exactly you are looking for to begin with.\nHaving a time limit in one of the levels doesn't really help either.\n\nSome of the few better and more complex puzzles which usually open a new frame to solve them, suffer from the somewhat arbitrary way of ending them: Some end automatically as soon as the right solution has been achieved, in others nothing is happening after getting the solution until the puzzle frame is exited. This results in situations where little oversights in a overall good but very tedious puzzles leads to the player exiting a puzzle, thinking it's solved, only to be forced redoing it from the beginning.","November 12, 2012","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"
