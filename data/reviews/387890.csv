It's obvious that it was meant for mobile because of the lack of options ( although there wouldn't be much of a need ); the developer could've at least spent another few moments on the code to add a sound-slider for music / effects but there's only one symbol which mutes all of it.\n\nI could've written this game in as little as 5 minutes. It consists of a background image ( either generated or static ) whereby another background image is flashed on screen every now and again ( so the primary bg could be black with a transparency active png/gif being displayed on top and then every now and again with an offset ), a large and small circle ( random sizes in a range ) placed on screen at a random location ( for simplicity we can say top/left of a square around the circle is 0, 0 so the maximum x and y coord [ clamped ] is Screen Width - largest circle size, Screen Height - largest circle size so it always shows on screen ), then it waits for clicks and compares the current size of both circles ( or it calculates the time it'll take for the one circle to be at the exact size of the other and uses the click time as a comparitor ).\n\nAs you can see, it's a very simple system and the idea is usually integrated into games differently ( ie allowing the player time to hit a button to successfully complete a move, making sure the player is actively playing to entire a wall or other trap isn't hit [ in the case of the helicopter flash game which moves sideways all the time and the player has to press space to apply upward "thrust" to prevent collisions with the ground of varying height and a ceiling; is more complex than this game ]. Calling this a game is an injustice.\n\nThe menu is non-existent.\n\nI purchased this as part of a bundle and I am trying to give fair reviews so the people reading this can see an honest review of this title and others I review.","January 16","false","0.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I guess not. Literally one of the most disappointing games I've seen. The developer seems to have pushed this out in a day or two, then left it to rot.\n\n\nOld Review\nFor $0.99 I can't really even explain to you why you should or should not buy this. I mean, it's only $0.99.\n\nYou click expanding circles to some nice music. I personally would enjoy it a bit more if there was a highscore system or something to not make it feel like a indie phone app. I played each game mode and then had to wait another minute just so I could post this review. There is not a ton to do in this game in case you haven't understood that from my review yet.\n\nThe particle effects are nice. And the lighting burns my eyes but it's pretty.\n\nBecause of the price tag nearly saying "Free", I'm going to recommend this.","August 4, 2015","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","45","5","11","2","0"
