He's even been practicing Kratos' trademark scowl of perpetual anger.\n\nUnfortunately for him he's a little like that friend who thinks they're a brilliant singer, only you'd rather force macaroni noodles inside your ears than listen to them belt out off-key renditions of what at some point where probably real songs but have morphed into unimaginable abominations through a voice you can't seem to escape. Garshasp is clumsy at his best of times, broken at his worsts, and always as entirely unpleasant as his almost reptilian face which firmly states that no, we are not and will never be friends (he's kind of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that).\n\nThe Monster Slayer is an action game that plays like a bunch of awkward breakdancers trying to murder each other but somehow only managing to land a hit every third try. Garshasp's movements are flashy, but annoyingly slow and prone to completely breaking the already poor hit detection, with hits and characters clipping through each other constantly as everyone flails around madly until they run smack into one of the omnipresent and aggressively restrictive invisible walls.\n\nEven when combat is "working" it's still essentially broken, with your character being entirely overpowered and enemies only being a threat so much as their outrageously large health bar threatens to put you to sleep as you monotonously mash the same buttons waiting for them to eventually die. The fixed camera is as pleasant and functional as a handicam held by someone who has had a few too many drinks, either obscuring platforms, breaking the environment, or causing you to puke as it stutters around erratically.\n\nAnd naturally there are the moments when the game simply gets a little fed up with having to even partially function and decides it's going to chop your framerate in half, or freeze up during an important jump, or just crash entirely because damn it being a game is hard and Garshasp has had enough of it! Frankly I've had quite enough of him as well.\n\nPlease don't call. Forget this ever happens. I'll be busy with drowning myself in booze hoping I can do the same.","January 19, 2015","false","3.5"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","83","38","46","17","1"

The voice acting is not very good, and the story, well a bunch of fantasy-sounding names doing this and that... I couldn't really keep track of who was who, so it was enough to know I had to kill the bad guy at the end.  Gameplay is basic hack and slash, and though you can kill most of the early grunts by simply grabbing them, later enemies need to be made vulnerable first.  Much like GoW, it has orbs to collect, quick-time-events, large boss battles, some cut-scenes, weapons upgrading, and special "rage" attacks.    The world is decently large, but there is little backtracking and generous save points to keep things moving.\n\nThe hack-and-slash gameplay is broken up with some light platform elements, a few sequences of sliding down walls, and quick-time-events for some of the boss battles.  Those QTE's are one of the bigger weaknesses, as it can be very tricky to trigger a few of them (looking at you - swamp boss).\n\nOther issues include some occasionally dodgy hit-detection, a sometimes problematic camera, and absolutely terrible keyboard-mapping; use an Xbox 360 controller.  On the plus side, the game has decent (if now dated) graphics, a good pace, some decent cut-scenes and at 4-5 hours on normal, it does not overstay its welcome.\n\nOthers have complained about the controls.  Be warned that the game by default works with an Xbox 360 controller, but it is not set up correctly until it is selected in the Game Configuration on launch!  Once this is done, the game controls exactly as expected: left stick moves, right dodges, and the buttons and triggers perform attacks and other actions.\n\nOverall, as a light-hearted action romp that does not require a whole lot of thought, it actually turns out to be a pretty fun game.  It is easy to get into, not so difficult that you can't progress with at most a few tries (on normal), and pretty satisfying when you actually get to the end.  Wait for a sale for sure and set your expectations accordingly, but once there it turns out to be a fun little budget action title that is well worth the small asking price.\n\n","May 29, 2015","true","8.6"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/recommended/99400/","TRCheese","Τhe Rolling Cheese Wheel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TRCheese/","4053 products in account","Garshasp: The Monster Slayer is a hack and slash game in a similar style to God of War. Unfortunately for this indie disaster, it only shares the same genre as God of War and none of the polish, breathtaking visual polish, and satisfying combat. The world of Garshasp is bland and boring, the story is generic, and the protagonist is the illegitimate child of the Prince of Persia and Kratos.\n\nThe combat in Garshasps is absolutely dreadful, the combat feels slow and repetitive. The lack of combat animation variety was pretty jarring even for a game that only lasts three hours. This is magnified further by the developer's arrogance to create zoom in effects whenever Garshasps does a grapple kill. It looks awful enough from a distance, it just looks downright funny close up. The sound effect also does the combat no credit. Everything sounds muffled and of low quality, combined with the fact that weapons clip through enemies makes it very difficult to feel any sort of satisfaction when smacking baddies around.\n\nThe puzzles and platforming in Garshasps, while bad, is still more serviceable than the combat. Moving obstacles have these huge boundary boxes that pushes you away if you get to close to them. This makes traversing areas with loads of moving traps tough because you can't predict when you'll get hit. You have to leave huge arbitrary amounts of space between Garshasp and the trap in order to avoid getting hit. It's still doable, and areas without any traps is a treat to run through. The wall sliding on the other hand is rage quit inducing. The sliding is incredibly fast and hard to deal with when the controls are unresponsive.\n\nShockingly enough, Garshasp does have some redeeming qualities. The game itself has a generic world but it is a well designed generic world. The swamp foliage and boss art design looks fantastic even without anti-alias, the textures didn't look half bad for a budget title. The story has a good origin in Iranian mythology, but delivered poorly through un-epic writing and very poor narration. Garshasp: The Monster Slayer is a stellar example of when good ideas can't formulate good games.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103845447\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103845439\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=103845478","December 3, 2013","false","25.3"," 42 of 64 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","42","64","0","5"

The graphics, the movements were also familiar, just i used dead monsters to upgrade my weapon, instead of healing myself. The fighting system is not too varied, and not bugless, but easy to use.  Music is okay, there was 1-2 cool tracks, especially i loved that one at the beginning of the 3rd part of the game, that was truly awesome. Achievements are working, and despite of having a strong feel of consoleism, i've had a very good time.","December 14, 2015","true","18.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","1"

I don't mind games that are lacking in quality, as long as they provide a good time. Unfortunately, this one soured rather quickly. For those of you out there who were planning on playing this with a controller, it's...extraordinarily hard to get used to. Left stick rolls, right stick/directional pad moves, etc. This was odd, but doable, so I learned it and continued on (though it didn't get easier). I found myself enjoying the level, despite being able to spam one attack that kills the majority of enemies in one hit, taking most of the challenge out of the fighting. The narrator sounds cheesy, Garshasp himself doesn't look human in cutscenes (seriously, look at community screenshots, it's kind of an inside joke), but the environments are nice, and the game sets up what could have been a decent action title.\n\nThere are those who like this game, and I definitely see why. I enjoyed it up until the infamous "wall falling" sequence in level one, where the game teaches you how to slide down a wall with a dagger whilst avoiding patches of wall that will dislodge you. This was fun--until I was instant-killed by a boulder that fell on my head after a 0.02 second window of it appearing on the screen. Obviously, trial-and-error is part of gaming, so I tried again, going different routes and speeding up his falling to avoid the boulder. About 20 tries (no joke) later, I had tried everything (going left, right, center, speeding up, slowing down, avoiding boulders, etc.), and even when I thought I'd passed it, the game instant-killed me despite seeing no boulder on the screen or imperfection in the wall. I'm not sure if it was a glitch, if there was a boulder that just didn't appear on screen, or what it was, but my journey with Garshasp ends here.\n\nThis is my first "not recommended" review, and it comes with regret. I wanted to like this game, and I enjoyed it up until the Invisible Instant-Death. You may very well enjoy this, especially if you have a soft spot for "bad" games, but be forewarned that many people cannot even get it to work. Check the latest issues in the Community section--some people can't get it to load at all (I couldn't until I messed around with the game's files and launched the application from the .exe file, for example), some people only get a title screen, etc. Also, if you'd like to try it but don't want to pay full price, check the bundle websites. Garshasp shows up in bundles quite a bit, which is where I got my copy.\n\nCheck this game out if you want to, but definitely do your research before purchasing.","September 10, 2014","false","0.9"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","16","22","0","0"

The up close action sequences trying to finish off the bosses are just too difficult to perform. After working on the boss for an hour I gave up. It's one thing to study the behavior of an enemy to find the timing of an attack pattern, but when you have him beaten this game makes you go through a complicated array of direction pad pushing where it's unclear what the symbols even mean. The timing is may prove frustrating to learn. Once you realize the symbols indicate which *direction on the D-PAD* you need to push it gets much easier. Don't pay more than $2 for this, but it is a good game if you get it at a low price.","April 7, 2014","true","10.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

This is a straight to the core knock-off of God of War obviously, just as it looks. And for a small indie dev team to do this in such a great way is amazing. It's obviously not as polished as god of War itself it, but they did a bang up job regardless.\nIt has just everything God of War has. Bloody Hack and Slash action (although the blood animations look a bit scrappy, they could have definitely put more effort into doing that better), it has character progression, you colelct red orbs just like in God of War that upgrade your abilities, it has quick time events to kill enemies just like God of War does, and it has massive boss fights the same as God of War does. It's not as brutal as God of War is, there isnt those bone crunching sound effects and geysers of blood everywhere, but thats all cosmetic. It's cool and adds to the feeling of a game, but it isnt necessary to have a good time playing it.\nWhile some people frown upon complete knock-offs, i do not. I rather enjoy them. It gives you the same game wiht a different theme and whole new storyline. Garshasp is an Iranian folk-lore character with the same level of badassery as Beowulf, or Hercules. I havent really dug into the game quite yet, ive only played for a short while, but it was enough to get a feel of the game and how it plays.\n\nI've also encountered one bug thats a bit annoying, especially mid-combat. If you're standing on top of an enemy as they dissapear after youve killed them, you get stuck in place until they are gone. This caused me to take some damage quite a few times. While not game breaking, it still should not have been overlooked and left that way.\n\nAll in all, there is no God of War on the PC, and for the extremely low price this game costs, its a great alternative. It has also been bundled quite a few times, so coming across a bundle code for next to nothing shouldnt be too hard either. You can literally have a functioning God of War type game on your PC for less than a dollar.\n\nOn a scale of 1-10 id rate this at 8/10.","January 4, 2014","true","0.4"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","3"

You probably also know about the cheestastic writing and voice-overs. None of that bothers me. I can live with it all and, while I'm not familiar with the Persian legend upon which this is based, Garshasp has a Cimmerian feel to it. Being a Conan fan, all of that cheesy goodness works in the game's favor for me.\n\nBut, oh man, that camera. That insanely bad camera that goes where it wants, when it wants and, over which, you have zero amount of control.  It's actually a bunch of static cameras placed in odd locations without any thought as to how that placement will affect gameplay, and there is no logic to it. This isn't a racing game, and I'm not watching a replay, so why not have it over my shoulder, like any other action game?  Why am I sometimes running toward the camera? This isn't Crash Bandicoot 2, and I don't see a polar bear chasing me, so what gives? You're seriously telling me this didn't bother anyone while they were building the game?\n\nBut even that isn't a deal breaker for me; I've played plenty of games with poor cameras, and I'm sure I'll play plenty more. No, the deal breaker for me is that the developers don't care about the player. Period. This is evident at the first boss, who crashes through a wall in front of you (one of the few times the camera is actually behind you, where it should be). He leaves behind a massive hole in the wall, through which you can easily fit. Yet, after the battle, the game switches to a top-down view (presumably hoping you won't notice the GIGANTIC HOLE IN THE WALL) and won't allow you to walk through it. Why? Because the developers have decided they want you to climb the ladder behind you instead.\n\nNope, sorry. Forget this game; life is far too short. God bless anyone for sticking with it as long as they did. This "developers vs players" ideal is just poor design, plain and simple. This ill-will could have been avoided by simply having the wall collapse behind the boss when he crashed through it, but apparently it wasn't important.  Instead, it's a slap in the face to people who paid for the game, and if the developers are sticking their collective middle finger up at me this early, I'm not sticking around long enough to see how bad it gets later.

The story is a generic revenge tale. The character models brow is absurd. The combat is not very fluid which is essential for this genre of game. The narrator isn't good either. He reminded me of the Conan movie narration but much much worse. The controls aren't mapped correctly for a 360 controller, but that's a small gribe compared to how bad the combat is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duggi/recommended/99400/","duggi","κattehus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duggi/","1389 products in account","So, I just finished this game and.. It wasn't that good.\n\nFirstly, the game is more-or-less built to be played with a controller. The camera-work is neat and all, but it moves around in such a way that just doesn't feel natural with keyboard/mouse. Which is weird, as it wasn't released on console (...According to Wikipedia) and it still has "save-points" and the like, which are(/were) typically signs of a console game.\n\nI played the game over three sessions, the first two of which lasted only half an hour/quarter of an hour, simply because I got bored of the game. The button-mashing was too much and the combat wasn't that great. Only in the last session did I "truck through" and play for a whopping hour and a half, and then the game was done.\n\nThe combat is nothing to speak of, with just a handful of combos (of which 'block+jump', 'block+interact', 'block+light-attack' and 'block+heavy-attack' being the majority) and a few (quite satisfying!) finisher-moves, that boiled down to either weird QTEs (which were, at times, notoriously hard to pull off because the game'd be too quick to register your first "command" and then you'd fail the QTE) or automatic KO's.\nThe bosses are, at first, interesting - but their moveset is way too easy to figure out, and then they become ludicrously easy.\n\nThe graphics are subpar, with a lot of visual artifacts. Animations are, at times, pretty wonky and there are places where it's possible to see through the terrain.\nThe camera moves by itself, which is probably for the best w.r.t. the graphics of the game.\n\nThe "levels" were very linear, although there are secrets (health-increasing bitbobs) that can be found by "exploring" a few hidden crannies here and there. The checkpoints seemed spread out quite generously, except for the few places where a mistake in your platforming would mean death.\nSpeaking of the platforming, it was fairly dull and easy - with the controls being the major reason of dying.\n\nThe story is okay-ish, but I could not stand the voice-work and the constantly repeating "combat track", although the three/five-ish instrumentals were pretty decent, they certainly lacked variety.\n\nAs an aside: The achievements seem fairly buggy. They (seemingly) only "count" your latest playthrough, as I got the "complete the game with no gameovers" achievement, although I know I died at points (but maybe that's just me not dying enough to not have a "continue"? I didn't see any indication of this, though). I also got the "Kill both Vlamboor without getting hit" achievement, but didn't get "Kill Vlamboor without getting hit". Who knows?\n\nAll in all, I wouldn't recommend this game. It's dull and subpar. Sure, if you _really_ need to kill three hours, but then, there's plenty of other indie games out there that are better. The legend of Garshasp deserves better than this game.","October 5, 2014","false","3.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's been called a God of War clone so many times that I'm beginning to think I should actually play God of War to see what all the fuss is about. If God of War is that good, I hope they make plenty of good clones based off of it. As far as this game goes, I had a blast playing it. My favorite part of the game was the art design which was truly original. I loved the originality of playing as a mythological Persian warrior Garshasp, (basically Persia's Beowulf). The combat was very fluent and fun, and the controls were tight and responsive. The biggest glaring flaw that this game had was that there is no control of the camera angle, which takes some getting used to. I'm not sure why they designed the game like that, but you do eventually get used to it, even though it is awkward at first. The game is also relatively short with little character development and story. So if character development and story are very important to you, an RPG might be a better option for you. Also, the last boss is a PAIN IN THE @$$!  It took me like ten tries to beat him! This game has good combat, wonderful art design, cool bosses, great controls, and just enough platforming parts to keep it interesting between combat without it becoming annoying. I had a lot of fun with it and the price is great.","April 17, 2014","true","8.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Here and there the plain hack'n'slash gameplay gets interrupted by boss fights and other things like sliding down a wall avoiding obstacles, steering some sort of boat or the usual - and quite simple - lever riddles.\n\nThe game has it flaws, as it's full of invisible walls, sometimes when fighting on a stair the enemies "sink" halfway into the ground, and the standard controller setting being totally messed up. At least the controller issue can be fixed by swapping the mapping of the two analog sticks in the seperate settings program before launching the game. As you can't edit the preferences from within the game better be prepared to quit and restart the game a few times until you get the settings right to suit your deeds.\n\nAnother problem I encountered was that when I first wanted to start the game all I got after the logos where shown was a black screen and an error message. I found out that you have to execute all the seperate installers in the game's redist folder on your harddrive (for eg OpenAL, PhysX, etc.) to get the game up and running. I think normaly this should be done automatically during the installation process of the game ... but ok ... it's a hassle but at least the game works flawlessly now ...\n\nWhen you got it up and running I personally found the game quite enjoyable. It's a no brainer hack'n'slash through and through. Nothing else to expect here. No exploration no fancy combos (though the charakter can learn some but you get notified about them - and you don't really need them - you can also play the game with the standard controls only without problems, except for some bosses, which I like).\n\nThe graphics look ok for me as they do their job but they are far away from being great seeing this game came out in 2011 and so it's relatively new ... but all works well ... everything fits quite well together ... and the artstyle is coherent throughout the game.\n\nWhat impressed me a bit were the really well done german voices. I haven't tried the english version yet but I guess they're well done to. For a game with this budget it's something special to have professionaly made voice overs I think.\n\nWell ... well ... ;)\n\n... all in all this game isn't expensive and when you like the genre I think you could buy it without really regretting it especially when it's on discount, what tends to happen on a regular basis. For what it is it's easily good enough for a single playthrough.","September 25, 2014","true","4.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There is action which is good, I think that the fighting sequences are well made. Unfortunally the controls are absolutely horrible. They are very stiff and at some points the game doesn't even react to the buttons you try to press which makes the game ard to play just because the character won't do as I want him to. The hitbox of the character could also be alot better. There is at a point in the where you take damege from enemies that is standing too far away from you to actually be able to hit you.\n\nThe game would be good if the controls were better and the hitbox was alittle smaller than it is, but now t's just frustrating to play and it feels like the amount of energy you put down to actually succeed in the game isn't worth to play it.\n\nI would not recommend this game.","January 3, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It tells the story of Garshasp , an ancient persian warrior who wants to avenge his brother's death by an evil warlord. This is a by the numbers hack and slash game not afraid of showing it's God of War influences. In fact , David Jaffe had an indirect role in the development of this game.\n\nThe game is 5 hours long in average. I've got yet to see if it has any new game plus mode or extra features once you beat it. However , it can take up to 10 hours or more to complete all achievements the game includes.\n\nWhen it comes to performance and pc specific features. For an Indie game , I would say it does the job. It includes a launcher where you can toggle some settings like texture quality , vsync , HDR and a couple more. Also you can include any resolution previously set with Nvidia Control Panel in case you want to downsample the game.\nIt has some glitches and stuttering /FPS drops from time to time (specially when there are many enemies on screen) but nothing too alarming or gamebreaking. I've had yet to have a CTD.\n\nAs a sidenote , the game includes dubbing to many languages (you can even play in Persian for extra epichness) but I haven't seen any subtitles option.\n\nGraphically speaking , it looks like a cross between a PS2 and a Seventh Gen title. Better looking than PS2 era God of War titles , but nothing special. The music and artstyle are really good though and the fit the mood of the game.\n\nAll in all I believe this is a title worth recomending. We need some more hack and slash games on PC and games like this one and Marlow Briggs will always be welcomed on the platform. I would say this game is a steal for 5 USD or less : AA production and very entertaining.","December 26, 2014","true","6.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls are terrible, camera is terrible, sound is terrible, graphics are terrible (mostly because of bugs that create random untextured walls and holes in the ground), gamelength is very short, gameplay is mediocre at best (like devil may cry, just without effects, combos and badassness, you have a sword though). If you don`t mind spending money on a game with a length of around 2 hours, an uncontrollable beast of a camera, crappy quick time events and an extremely high level of fun which is roughly on par with ♥♥♥♥ing minesweeper without mines, then go ahead and give this game a shot - surprisingly enough, it is still better than Garshasp 2 after all.","August 27, 2011","false","3.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There are a lot of long, boring, UNSKIPPABLE cutscenes that basically fly through the area you are about to fight through.

Wrong, the mechanics are the same, but there are very little combos, the attack animations are unimpressive, the killing animations are rather boring and your dodge almost never works cause you move too little away from the incoming attack, but ignoring the “looks” of the battle, the battle system is pretty solid and does its job very well.\n\nSo, the game keeps throwing hordes of enemies at you, and you have to kill them all to advance, good old hack`n slash style, and the enemies are kinda cool, not really a LOT of variety, but enough to get the game going, the game is rather small so you will not get annoyed by the lack of variety while the game lasts, in addition to the hordes the game throw at you, sometimes you have to stop and turn levers or activate buttons, while you do those actions, more enemies come at you, and this feels actually really lame, cause there is no penalty when you stop doing the action, so you can stop, kill all the enemies and then do the action and it will all be good, which destroys the purpose of having the horde on the first place.\n\n- Boss Battles:  – 4/10\nThe boss battles feel the same as normal battles, the only real difference is a big life gauge on the top of the screen and the over-sized enemy... yeap, that is it\n\n- General:   - 8/10\nNow, a really cool mechanic that the game has is “sliding” down on the walls, there is a lot of walls in the game where you have to slide your way down, and this is actually a pretty good and solid mechanic, you will have to avoid gaps on the wall and salient rocks or you will loose your grip and die, you can speed up or slow down your sliding so you can avoid obstacles, this I must say, is the better working mechanic on the entire game.\n\n- Leveling Up:  – 5/10\nLeveling up works similarly to god of war, where you collect red orbs to fill your level gauge, but the problem is, you don’t choose which weapon or perk you wanna level up, the orbs will go to the weapon you are using at the moment and will upgrade the weapon level giving you new combos with that weapon, so you are not really in control of how you level up, the red orbs can be found by killing enemies, destroying objects or in a big “chest”-like orb(you can replenish your life with a blue variation of this “chest”)\n\nYou also can upgrade your health amount by collecting 4 “tears”, they are blue things that look like orbs, they are hidden in the environment and each boss drops one after killed.\n\nGraphics:  – 5/10\nWhile the graphics are nothing amazing, they do their job, the 3D models are good, kinda low poly, but good, the textures are outdated, they seem like something out of the ps2 era, the cutscenes do look a lot better, but this being a 2011 game, they are outdated as of now.\n\nThe HUD and the boss health gauges look really bad, they are really sharp and dont blend in on the rest of the graphics, but they do their job and will not damage the experience even one bit as you will almost never look at them.\n\nYou can see some graphical bugs trough the game, they are not many, but they sure are easy to spot, I am impressed the developers missed them.\n\nAudio:  – 4,5/10\n- Music:  - 6/10\nThe music is rather blend, but it is not bad, you wont really feel it but it gives a nice background noise while you slain all those monsters.\n\n- Sound Effects:  – 5/10\nThe main menu noises are annoying as f*ck, they are loud and look like they were cut in half, the weapons and other sfx sounds pretty good, leaving me thinking why the hell would the menu sounds be so awful.\n\n- Voice:  – 3/10\nThe monsters noises are... ok, but the narration is bad, really bad, the narrator voice is quite dry and annoying, and he tries to simulated an old man narrating, speaking very slow and keeping his voice down, but it doesnt work, just looks like someone was trying very hard while reading some papers for the first time in their life.\n\nStory:  – 2/10\nI don’t even know how to rate this, cause the game story is really dumb and the lore is almost non existent, the old man narrates all the story and from what I could understand it is: Garshasp was trying to prove that he is amazing, his brother was killed by some random monster for some random reason, they stole his brother mace, and now Garshasp has to retrieve the mace cause it has the power to destroy the world... awesome, no? Lets be easy here, the story on this game doesn’t really matter, you just wanna kill some monsters and go on a adventure, but man... this is a really ♥♥♥♥ and messy excuse for you to go on a adventure... this is the worst part the game has to offer\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is not GREAT or AMAZING, but it sure is fun, it has only 4 hours so you should not expect much from it, you will play those 4 hours and probably like them, but they sure aren’t the best 4 hours you ever spent in a game.\n\nIf you have some free time and wanna play something just for the fun, buy this at a high sale, more than 80% should do, and you will probably not regret it.\n\nTopic		Score				Gameplay		4,5				Graphics		5				Audio		4,5				Story		2				Final		4","December 28, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

It tells the story of Garshasp, a dude with a beard and eyebrows who is on a quest to reclaim the Mace of somebody (?) to avenge somebody (?). His journey is full of wallsliding (enjoyable except for the last one) boss fights (mediocre to fun) and arenas (tiresome). It has upgrading weapons (sword/mace) and various combo strings of varying use.\n\nFinishing moves can be fun, but mostly are too slow/ugly animated to be enjoyable. Animations all around are pretty terrible.\nThe story is nonexistent and should be ignored, the combat is good and occasionally feels fun, and locales are varied enough to not grow old over the 3-4 hours this game will take you.\nIt can be tough and unforgiving, and Garshasp's face on the game over screen is incentive to not die. 7/10 Brows 'n' Beards","October 11, 2012","true","4.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","15"

Dead Mage's indie title is a near identical copy of Playstation's God of War, from the quick time events straight down to the health shrines. All other differences are purely cosmetic.\n\nFortunately, the developers did do a few things right. The kill animations are slick and the environments look nice for an indie title. Platforming areas add a nice break from the constant hacking and slashing.\n\nUnfortunately, the cons outweigh the pros. The camera angle is fixed and unadjustable, needlessly making battles with enemies a lot harder than they should be. The controls feel unresponsive, especially the movement keys. Garshasp's moveset is very limited, making combat soon feel repetitive.\n\nMaybe it's good that Garshasp is a short game. Any longer and I might have just given up on it. If you're a fan of hacking and slashing and have a few dollars and hours to spare, then maybe, just maybe, give Garshasp a chance.\n\nGrade: C","April 14, 2012","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game play is nice and has alot of offer, the game has the feel of God Of War. You get mode abilities as you progress through the game. The graphics aren't always the greatest. The gameplay is fun and involves slashing and dicing your enemy. The game can feel repetitive at times with all the monsters but it makes up for it with the new abilities you will acquire. There are some bugs in the game that might prevent you from reaching certain points in the game but can be redone when go to the last checkpoint. Its a great game for anyone looking for an adventure. Just make sure you get this one on sale to get your monies worth.  The overall game is well done but you would need to play it through at least 2 times to full understand the story and whats going on. Its a game that doesn't get the credit it deserves.","July 3, 2011","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For a GoW clone done right, check out the great "Marlow Briggs". This, while a worthy effort, fails in almost every aspect.\n\nThe game looks bad. The textures and the visuals are very basic, yet that doesn't prevent the game from having constant frame-drops. OK, my computer's certainly not the best, far from it, but a game such as THIS should not have such frame dips.\n\nThe game is a name-dropping fest: the evil whatshisname killed your brother whomever and stole the whatchamacallit and is now going to use it to wreak havoc in the kingdom of whatever. And that's about it. The story's told via poor cutscenes and clumsy infodumps. The writing, needless to say, is childish at the best of times, and borderline ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ otherwise.\n\nThe combat is boring and imprecise. The hitboxes are flawed, at best. Your sword kinda floats through enemies as if they were immaterial, whole combos and movement are floaty, in fact. And, as I said, boring just because of the said fact. There's no strategy or variety to them.

In fact, it was the worst review I ever gave to a game.\n\nThe reason was simple, the game didn't work with recent updates of Nvidia Physx, and since other games required the most recent version of Physx the game didn't allow us to have other games installed. So, for more than two years I wasn't able to play the game.\n\nProbabily Nvidia, or Steam, or even Windows, solved the problem because the developers didn't release any updates since 2011, even with all the complaints they have received. I'm still waiting for an answer from them.\n\nThe truth is, recently I decided to give the game a second chance and see if the problems were fixed and it's kind of a miracle, but the game works.\n\nSo, about it, it's clearly a ripoff of God of War. But it has its own charm and qualities, so if you liked God of War and are looking for an alternative to the PC, you can enjoy this game. The story is simple but good enough and the gameplay and graphics are also good enough.\n\nThe real great problem of the game is the camera, I almost lost to the first boss because of it, and in many times it's responsible for a bad jump followed from a fall into the abyss or getting hit because you stop seeing your character and the enemy, wich can be frustrating at times.\n\nSo, if you can leave with a bad camera and the total lack of support from the developers and you want a game similar to God of War on the PC, this is a good enough alternative.\n\nThis time, I give it a thumbs up because I could find good things in the game and potential and have already bought it, but the total lack of support from the developers almost makes me give it a thumbs down. You shouldn't sell games if you don't give them support. So, it's up to you if you want to ignore it and give money to some guys who don't care about you and simply enjoy the game they made or not.","February 12, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
