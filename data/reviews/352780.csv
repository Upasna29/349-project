It isn't a plausible story with all of its sorcery and magic spells, but also seems to be a lot less fantistical then the sort of dragon and giant spider fighting fantasy stories you might expect as well.\n\nSo far, the writing seems well done, and the art work is really nice.  I am impressed both visually with the art and the writing so far, about 15% through the game.  (You can check your progress at any point from the main menu)\n\nConsidering I am reading this story for my YouTube videos so far, and I am pace for about 10 hours, most people not reading the dialogue aloud will probably read at least twice as fast.  I'd guess this is a 3 to 5 hour game for most people, which will depend greatly on the user naturally with how fast they read or 'skim over' the writing.\n\nBe advised at I just barely got into some pretty mature and very sexual-in-nature content at the 15% mark.  I was kind of surprised by this and the fact that there was no mention anywhere that I saw that this game/novel included sexual or adult content.  No nude art as of yet, but pretty mature sexually natured dialogue, and I can see that it might get much more graphic in the near future.  I will update this as I play through, but BE ADVISED THAT THIS GAME MAY NOT BE SUITABLE FOR CHILDREN/MINORS ESPECIALLY YOUNGER CHILDRED UNDER THE AGE OF 14 OR SO.\n\nSo far, I have enjoyed it, so at this early point I will give it a thumbs up with the understanding that I may change this entire review and even my recommendation at any time.  But right now, with the amount of content, the quality of the writing, the entertainment value, and the really nice artwork, I'd give this a thumbs up to anyone who enjoys this kind of game and/or novel.\n\nAt this point 15% in, there has been NO choices, and NO gameplay at all.  It's just reading and clicking the screen to move forward.  This is fine for me, as I'm sure choices will be made at some point, but I realize this might upset some people, which is why I have pointed this out.","March 27, 2015","true","4.5"," 55 of 73 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","55","73","2","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamnit/recommended/352780/","jamnit","Jamnit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jamnit/","353 products in account","This is a fantastic game with a fantastic story.\nIt's a long visual novel, a single playthrough with the non-canon ending was three hours, and it's not like most games (even most visual novels that I've played) in that you make very few decisions. I believe, on my first playthrough, that my first decision didn't take place until about 45 minutes or an hour into the game.\n\nWhich brings me to my larger point: this is a game for people who like to read and really enjoy a story. Decisions are fundamental to the game and many of them directly impact which ending you're going to experience, but you won't be choosing little things all the time. You'll be making big decisions, the narrative will be allowing the characters to make the small decisions.\n\nThat said, and it's said simply to inform so as to help those who might buy the game to avoid any confusion or frustration with the style of the game, and as I said before: the story is fantastic. There was a great deal of care and consideration put into the writing of this work, there are moral and social quandaries and complexities which are shown to the player and, depending on player choices, the player gets to see the difficult (and not wrong) decisions and opinions formed based entirely on the perspective of the character.\n\nAs one character says in the game, in a battle there are no good guys and bad guys. We all go through life convinced that we're right. Those of us who fight do so because we believe we'll get justice. Gilligan suggested that all violence is created by people seeking justice who believe they deserve something which they're being deprived of: be it respect, objects, or any number of other complex social equations. Violence is the attempt to replace feelings of shame and inadequacy with pride and worth. The writing in this game is good enough that it successfully creates multi-faceted characters who always have reasons for whatever violence they might create, and the game creates such a complex social tapestry that it's easy to see how the individuals (on both sides of the conflict) are, in their own way and with their own limited perspectives, right.","April 7, 2015","true","7.5"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

These aren't really spoilers but rather surprising things.\nAn Octave Higher is an interesting VN, I could recommend for anybody, mostly because it's not a dating sim, it's not lewd, it's not gory or depressing, nor silly.\nIt is a branching story about people, music, magic, science, revolution, betrayal and life.\nIt has multiple main characters, or rather story is told from point of view of several characters, what's unusual for a VN.\nThere aren't that many choices, but most of those matter. As the story is branching, there are several endings.\nA game is accompanied by classical music, what's also somewhat unusual. Music is definitely strong part of An Octave Higher.\nIt's rather long, takes about 10 hours to finish.\nVisual part is weak, though. While backgrounds are nice and detailed, characters are somewhat simplistic and don't go well with those backgrounds, also there is certain lack of variety here.\nOTOH writing is not bad, even with some mistakes there and here.","June 27, 2015","true","14.4"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","28","29","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/recommended/352780/","duszynski","A Star in Darkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/duszynski/","155 products in account","This was truly a big surprise. I like visual novels despite that a fair amount of them have weak storylines, but this visual novel's story was not weak at all. It was surprisingly well-done and just awesome. Honestly, it could've made a decent storyline for a RPG, but I know indie companies don't always have the money for that.\n\nThe point-of-view switches between three different characters. I like this because it allows the reader to see from different story perspectives. It also doesn't cater to one character's biased interpretations of events. After playing through the game a lot, I must say that I think Elise is supposed to be the main character of the three.\n\nThe achievements for this game comprise of 5 endings and 1 easter egg. There is also a 6th ending that doesn't yield an achievement (because it's neutral/generic). The easter egg is hilarious, by the way.\n\nThe artwork of this game is impressive. Although, sometimes the characters look a bit awkward in how they're drawn.\n\nThe music is lovely. Quite lovely. This is to be expected considering the title of the game.\n\nI definitely recommend this game for those who like visual novels! It might also serve to be a good game to introduce someone to visual novels, since it's definitely one of the better ones out there.","June 15, 2015","true","17.1"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","21","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/recommended/352780/","callistawhite","CallistaWhite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/callistawhite/","137 products in account","An Octave Higher is a visual novel that takes place in the fictional world of Overture where magic exists and a person's place in society depends on if/how they can use magic as well as that person's financial wealth.  Imagine that the setting of this game is similar to the US in the 19th century Industral Revolution except that magic actually exists and you'll get the idea of the premise here.  Basically, you play as three different characters-Frederic, Franz, and Elise-and they are rotated accordingly in the story.  As this is a visual novel, choices do matter.  Depending on the choices you make, you can find yourself aligned with certain characters.  For example, if you play as Franz, you can make decisions that align him closer to Elise or to Aretha, Franz's friend.  Also, decisions regarding whether Franz and Frederic get along determine whether more of the story becomes revealed (and thus, the true path gets told) or it ends.  Although the first half of the story reveals this, the second half reveals it even more-that there is huge class disparity between the aristocracy/bourgeoisie and the proletariat-and magic plays a role in this class division.  That's basically all I will say without revealing more although I will say that the true path is the most tragic so be warned.\n\nThere are a total of 6 different endings although one of those endings doesn't show up as a Steam achievement.  The art is beautiful and I especially love the music in this game.  I'm a huge fan of music from the classical and Romanticism eras and the selected pieces fit really well at certain moments.  Of course, there is original music as well and it was equally enjoyable.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this game if you're a fan of visual novels and love a good story.  There isn't really any romance in this game but the story is so good that it isn't necessary.  After all, all visual novels don't need to have romance to make them enjoyable.  Also, I'd recommend getting the soundtracks (in DLC format), as I found the music tracks very enjoyable and soothing to listen to.  I'm certainly looking forward to the prequel-One Small Fire at a Time-and hope to be able to play it in the near future.  ^^","April 17","true","39.7"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","18","18","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhuinden/recommended/352780/","zhuinden","Zhuinden (人^▽')～","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zhuinden/","2363 products in account","(We played this 7.2 hours and 100%ed it on a different account, and not on mine.)\n\nTruth be told, I don't really want to say anything like "stay away from this game, it's terrible, blah blah blah" because it's really not. It's a visual novel with multiple endings (although most of the story is the same between the paths, apart from the true ending with its two paths). There is no additional gameplay element beyond the game being a VN, so don't look for that kind of thing. Of course, that's not a problem. It's a VN.\n\nAnyways, as a VN, it can be judged for its art, characters, story, and music. Art is fine, characters are mostly fine, music is interesting and fairly classical...\n\nAnd the story had so much potential... And fell so flat on its face. The true path is literally the worst path among all the paths.\nHowever, the magic system was innovative. This game was clearly partly designed by an influence of engineers in its writing, with a magic system driven by applying functions and magic being a series of equations; but also referring to control systems, and really heavy reference to digital logic / digital design on the engineering side of things. It's smart! It's really smart. And then some questions are asked... then Libertad comes in and leaves ALL other questions unanswered, while also leaving their own set of questions unanswered.\n\nLibertad and the revolution literally sinks the story completely. It just doesn't have a proper ending... and it doesn't have a direction. It just has a message, one that doesn't really know where it's going, considering the problem it asks ISN'T SHOWN TO BE RESOLVED. Barely ever have I seen a true path both heartlessly cruel and also unsatisfying due to the complete lack of closure.\n\nSo:\n\n- PROS:\n--- interesting world, innovative magic system (in terms of world design), in-depth explanation of how magic drives things (how the omnibuses fly and stuff, it's really cool)\n--- fancy classical music\n--- fun characters (excluding true path where everyone is either too verbose, naive, annoying or just stupid), Aretha is best girl\n--- many interesting questions asked with a lot of intelligent facts thrown into the debate, there are quite a few things in here that are legitimately smart.\n\n- CONS:\n--- Libertad, anything in the story that has to do with Libertad, and therefore everything in the true path\n--- Due to the excessive amounts of Libertad in the story, most other main questions are left unanswered, and the Libertad plot leaves even more questions to be answered that are left unanswered\n\n- VERDICT:\n--- If you like VNs, this one is set in a world that's driven by a REALLY interesting magic system, mostly based on engineering facts and aspects taken from the real world while also merging it the aspect of emotional intelligence. So it's worth checking out just for that.\n--- The true ending is sunk by Libertad and is complete garbage from start to finish with no direction.\n\nOverall? Worth checking out... I'd recommend to, actually, just for the magic system. It's an interesting thing to see Amplify(Transform(Willpower)) + Amplify(Transform(Courage)) as a means of casting Meteor.\n\n\nBut the endings might leave you frustrated, without a sense of closure. You ask, "wait, that's it? What the hell was the point? Why did that even happen? Did that achieve anything? Does anything change? Also, what was up with..." and you get no answers.\n\nIn the end, while the VN is pretty interesting, this review is a warning that the endings might not be something you like, and might not be something you expect, and you might not get the answers you are looking for. There's a bunch of other cool things here though! So don't be put off too hard by my warning.","April 10","false","0.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","18","22","0","1"

Espically a story about flaws of a system that can't easily be change but that is not fair. How you go through the perspective of people living on both sides of the system on where the rich keeps get richer and the poor ends up suffering more and more. How people keep suffering until they can't handle it no more. Also really enjoy the art and piano scores through out the game. If I have to point faults there are a few but my opinion. Sometimes they lose story on spending so much time on one side of the system. There is no window mode as far I can tell. When you hide the text try to take a screen shot the text pops right back up while your doing it. Outside of that would reccommend this to anyone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/recommended/352780/","MrRokuro-san","Mr. Businessman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrRokuro-san/","330 products in account","Okay this is the first time I reviewed a VN (I did one before with A Kiss for the Petals though that's not a 'proper' review imo) on Steam so bear with me, okay?\n\nI count myself among the minority seeking out for more narrative-driven games and for better narratives within them.  And in this sense, I adore visual novels genre. So, when this gem showed up on my recommendation list, I wasn't expecting much. Maybe some average story, a couple silly characters, that sort of thing. What I got, instead, was a journey to an entirely new and exciting world that left me with a feeling of intrigue and a longing to someday return. A story about how circumstances can divide people.\n\nSet in the city of Overture, a large city in the midst of an industrial revolution spurned by the discovery and implementation of magic, An Octave Higher comprises a nest of concrete and steel itself governed by the marriage of science and magic... that you might even call it magical science. From scientific theory to engineered machines, mana and the powers it provides Overture in its entirety. As you can probably tell, the story revolves around magic, where it is the key to it all: education, industries, to the country’s militia, and is even used in everyday livelihoods for the upper districts and for those who can afford mana potions. Anyone with a mana potion can cast spells, and must do so if they want to live comfortably. Heated water? That calls for fire magic, born from the Courage attribute. Want healing? Summon your Compassion. Omnibuses, the flying taxis of the city, operate on wind and gravity magic (Faith and Willpower).\n\nBut magic is far from a catch-all solution if not without costs... It’s borne problems of its own as the city is divided into a three-class system. The Aristocrats on top are the wealthiest, living in their manors and are in charge of most industries of any and all magic machines. The Bourgeois are the middle class where most can afford to use magic and to go to schools that teach the usage of magic. They primarily live in the middle city that takes care of itself. Lastly, the Proles, who make up the poor class that you will usually see in dead-end jobs, are rotting in the shanty towns that make up the lower quarters of Overture. Where the lower class is consistently in awe of the magic and machinery that the rich take for granted, the upper-class look down upon the proles, who grow more and more resentful. Poor citizens are reduced to being compared to simple parts in a machine, and at a certain point in the game we overhear a conversation among factory owners who weigh costs between buying new machinery or hiring more workers.\n\nAnd this is where we meet our three main protagonists and their respective roles in society. There's Frederic, an aristocrat brat who is pretty much awful to everyone he interacts with despite being a great sorcer player. Soon after, we meet Franz, a well-off student and researcher at the local university. And finally Elise, a young factory worker who lives at a brothel and in a few short months is expected to join the ranks. The narrative jumps around between these three characters liberally and it does effectively convey what everyone is thinking about in any particular situation.\n\nAt this point, I can't say enough about the writing. The pacing is excellent, and it encapsulates world building to an almost perfect point. In every instance, the writers find ways to explain details to players. Questions such as: what does the average factory worker's day entail? How does this machine work? What are the rules of the arena sports game, Sorcer? All of these details are provided in context. Another aspect of the game I really loved was the complex theories of magic layered within it. I have no doubt that the game developers spent many hours getting the magic theories down to a science (like its clever use of using magic theories in place of real mathematics), and the end result presented to us definitely allowed me to further immerse myself in the rich fantastical world of Overture. I do wish there was voice-acting in the game though, as that would have definitely aided in the immersion experience.\n\nThe music, while a bit lacking in variety, is pleasant and soothing. This gives gameplay a relaxing and calming effect, which in turn causes the hours of playtime to quietly float by. Sound effects within the game have a tendency to fall flat, but they aren't distracting and don't take away from the experience.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed playing this visual novel and it is undoubtedly one of the better visual novels I've played in recent memory. I grew really fond of the game's setting and characters by the end of the story, and I believe that the game's world still has a lot of potential left to be explored. This visual novel is one that fans of fantasy stories should definitely give a try! And by the way, the developer, Kidalang, already announced a prequel to this game called  A Small Fire at a Time  so make sure to look out for it!","December 11, 2015","true","10.9"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","12","13","0","0"

The story is told from the alternating perspectives of three characters brought together by an unusual research project: Frederic, a narcissistic aristocrat; Franz, a brilliant but asocial student of magic; and Elise, a factory worker who dreams of being a musician.\n\nWhile the story can be heavy on exposition at times, it's necessary to explain the complex and unique way magic works in the city of Overture in order for the plot to make sense. And aside from a bit of awkwardness when it comes to fitting those details into conversation, the story is really well-written. It's full of original ideas and morally complex characters, and while it's mostly pretty serious and dramatic, it has its moments of comedy as well.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed it, and I recommend it to anyone else who wants a good visual novel that's not too long. Make sure you don't stop after one ending, as there are several, some of which involve a much longer story than the others.

Its handling of the topics is really high-school-level "intro to communism," but that still gives it stronger themes than most visual novels.

I personally wish that the devs spent more time on the character art (its honestly pretty bad) especially when they've showed off such detailed and interesting backgrounds throughout the game. The devs also beat you over the head with their rules of magic. They make sure to point out at every opportunity that something is powered or created using magic. They go into such depth about random clocks and carriages that it suspends the narrative to circle-jerk over their own created universe. As far as VN's go, An Octave Higher also lacks many of the bells and whistles that other VN's have such as gesture controls, smart skipping and as far as I can tell, branching story lines based on choice.\n\nNow, on the positive side (and please bear in mind that I am only 25% of the way through). The story is good enough for what you pay. You take on the perspective of 3 separate and very different characters. Each one offers an interesting perspective on the brewing class-war, and each offers up their own unique feel and backstory. As far as choice, there hasn't been much, but I believe that the story is fine without it at this point. The world is interesting enough, the conflict (while slow to emerge) is an archetypal classic, and I am truly interested to read more and more into the story to see how life develops for the main characters.\n\n7.5/10 Get it on sale and it's worth every penny.\n\nEDIT: I have now played through the majority of the endings and this game is incredible. There is an entire second act that has to be discovered before you can fully experience the true story of this game. That story is engrossing, gritty and can end a few different ways (Although i personally don't prefer the true ending).

It is not voiced, which can be seen as a poor point - but I don't think so. No erotic content.\n\nPros:\n+ New mechanics: unlike the traditional Visual Novel you can decide the choices of 3 different characters, giving a new dimension to the tree of choices.\n+ Great music - even if the OST is not at the edge of excellence it is written with care and emotion, and the collection of classical music is well chosen.\n+ I appreciated the courage to talk about uncomfortable topics like paupery, social balance and so on, not as a mean to differentiate eroge characters but as a central topic.\n+ Round characters, with charisma and realism.\n+ I know it sounds kind of n00b-ish, but... AFFECTION POINTS DISPLAY! THANK YOU!\n+ Presence of easter eggs...\n\nCons:\n- ... that seem to have been added forcefully, sticking out a little too much for my taste.\n- The storywriting style is sometimes too innatural: especially lessons and explanations seem to have been written just to provide the reader with some lore background, and their style is poorly matched with the context in which it is put.\n- Short, too short. Given the mechanics explained above, it would have been a great deal to have complex tree branching with multiple side-effects, it would have given the story a greater complexity and would result in a more enjoyable game. Maybe next time.\n\nThe overall impression is that this game was made "on a budget", but for the budget, a very good experience!

I had a few minor qualms in that first, I wish there was more art for the characters that were left out or reused, and more facial expressions. Second, three hours was way too short for me and even though I only finished the story once I wish it was longer and had more content.

From the lovingly detailed and unique setting to the individual characters who (for the most part) feel very real, everything in this story flows smoothly. The game gives you some limited choices to make that will have a DRASTIC effect on the outcome of the story, so there is some significant player interaction. Otherwise, it's a nice ride. The music is pretty good, but you will hear the same songs repeatedly; that being said, they are not bad songs.\n\nMy biggest gripe (if you couldn't tell) was with the so-called 'true' ending. Honestly--and this probably reflects my own personal beliefs--there were times I was literally cringing while playing this ending. Once I got to part 2, everything just fell to pieces...it still flowed superbly and was well-written, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ it all if I didn't end up hating 2/3 of the main characters. Which was odd, because in part 1 they were both charming, in their own ways. I feel Elise (probably the biggest POV in part 2) was not true to her character, despite what others may feel, and this made me almost stop playing. A side character from part 1 becomes much more important in part 2 that I immediately liked roughly 5,000 times more than Elise, which is strange, considering their similarities...\n\nAnyways, the 'true' ending still delivers a technically good story, even though I feel like I was dragged through mud on purpose for a good while. If you like a great story and don't mind the lack of voices, this is more than worth the $12.","April 3","true","7.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

The story takes place in Overture, a city that uses magic for day to day activities. While it seems like a dream, there's a dark side to Overture, the harsh class system which has been stoking the flames for revolution and rebellion. Through the different endings of the game, you can lead a revolution or fight against it. What I loved most about this game is how logical the magic system is. In addition, I found it refreshing to have a visual novel which is not solely focused on winning the girl/guy/bird. There are brief romantic aspects of the story, depending on which ending you want; however they are not the crux or the main focus of the story.  It is tragic, funny and gives you a sense of hope through each of the endings.\n\nGameplay wise, the UI is very straightforward and there's nothing too difficult about it. I would recommend to try to get each ending  as a way  to fully appreciate the entire experience and the story.\nIn short, if you are a fan of visual novels or if you simply enjoy a good story, I would definitely recommend this game for you.","April 5","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The dialogue can get pretty hilarious often enough as well.\n\nThe only thing I have to point out is there does seem to be a lot of ellipses at certain points--mostly during transitions to another place, starting another day, etc. Perhaps this was part of the plan, since during some of the transitions, a character is traveling so perhaps it was to add to the overall feeling of time passing.\n\nOh, and the save system is a little wordy.

On one hand, getting access to visual novels without having to wait for translation sounds fantastic, but on the other the majority of these new titles lack the funding and quality of story to stand up to their Japanese counterparts. While An Octave Higher is not the OELVN we’ve all been waiting for, it’s most definitely a step in the right direction, boasting a novel and intriguing setting in addition to exploring moral issues that are both interesting and relevant.\n\nWhatever complaints I may have had, I enjoyed my time with An Octave Higher. I loved the setting and the scientific representations of magic, and even cared about the characters by the time the story had reached its end. However, I felt that the routes didn’t conclude in a satisfying way and failed to tie up the various plot threads meaningfully (though the bits before the endings were still enjoyable). The technical aspects, while not impressive, aren’t deal-breaking and have their own charm. All-in-all, An Octave Higher sits on the better side of the fence of available OELVNs and if it sounds like the setting or story would interest you then you should definitely give it a go.\n\nFull review at [https://thegeekclinic.wordpress.com/2015/04/12/visual-novel-review-an-octave-higher/]","April 11, 2015","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In fact, they even have an education major called Magical Science, however contradictory that sounds. The story takes place in Overture, a kingdom where the people are divided into three different classes: Aristocrats, Bourguoises, and Proletariats. You will experience the story from three different perspective, with each character coming from a different class, and therefore has different way of thinking, knowledge, or even belief.\n\nIt tells a deeply compelling story about friendship, conflict, betrayal, and hope. It's very hard to point out the good points without spoiling anything, but if you're looking for a non-anime/non-cliche story with high emotional stakes, look no further. An Octave Higher will give you a hell of a ride, one that won't be easily forgotten.\n\nBy the way, the game has SIX endings: 1 premature ending, 3 "relationship" endings, 1 true ending, and 1 alternate/bad ending. Playism has an official guide in their website, and I suggest you get them all.

Not really Otome, though there are some romantic bits. Any adult content I found so far was some swearing and some "adult discussion" dealing with prostitution / teasing banter between characters,\n\nThis is a visual novel with fewer choices than I'm used to but appear to really swing the story (at least in the few places where I played the save before and go back trick).  Three main characters: 2 guys and a girl that the perspective swings between sometimes after some pages, other times after a sentence or two. The music is classical and fitting the story. At one point tongue in cheek humor that gave me a chuckle. I enjoyed the style of art with a fair number of CGs and nice background changing all the time. The use of moving and switching images of the characters to indicate a change in point of view was new to me.\n\nThis is very well written. One character studies magical scinece and the amount of thought and writing around the theory and logic of magic in this world (see the blackboard images from in game for a quick glance) coupled with the theory of the mage battles for the "sport" sorcerer makes it intellectually capturing and wishing there was a spin-off game letting you use it to wage battles and discover new spells.\n\nFor the theme: think Les Misereables meets Harry Potter or more so the Chronicles of Chrestomancy.\n\nI'll be trying the walkthrough next to see some of the true paths over the coming weeks.

The setting is interesting and the writing is intelligent and occasionally quite witty.

So uh, that escalated a bit, but it's a fun ride.\n\nMore details on the writing:\nIt's witty.\nThere are some innuendos and a brothel features as a story location, but no real explicit content or fanservice.\nThere are long stretches without player choice, but there are meaningful choices with direct or indirect consequences.\nFor a few minutes after the intro there's a sequence that summarizes the setting's magic system, and you do need to at least halfheartedly pay attention to it. It's not that bad.\n\nFor a negative, the devs seem to have made their own VN engine, and the controls are unorthodox and take some getting used to.

However, you have to make a certain few decisions to unlock the second half of the game.

It stands on its writing, which is good because it doesn't break the standard visual novel mold. My biggest problem with An Octave Higher is that it goes to a great deal of trouble to teach the player about how magic and magical formulas work, but then never lets the player choose what magic to use.

I’m not one hundred percent certain what it is. Obviously I am not illiterate. Clearly there’s a passion there somewhere. But when it comes to reading I’m not as big a reader as what I should be. I’m a much more visual person. I find lengthy texts to be disengaging. Yet to contradict myself I finished half a dozen books last year which isn’t a lot but it was for me. Further yet, quite a number of my favorite texts are lengthy. for example, my favorite book is the 960 page epic Swan Song written by Robert McCammon. Therefore I approached writing about a visual novel with great trepidation.\n\nI fed into my own fears while experiencing An Octave Higher because the constant sense of disengagement when compared to other gaming genres was very real. Yet at simultaneously I could not help myself from being drawn into and immersed in a wonderfully crafted and detailed world. The amount of care and devotion to creating this experience was very evident. Kidalang wove their powerful tale of magic and class like the very best storytellers. It continued to draw me in. The further I read the more I became of its world. The meticulous effort by the team of artists to create powerful imagery to merge with the text was phenomenal. The text itself is extremely well written because it presents a topic that is thought provoking. The issue of class in the real world has always been an important one and there is much to consider from the author’s take on it here.\n\nThe only thing that I found lacking in the game was a lack of voice over work. I haven’t spent enough time playing visual novels to have a greater appreciation for the inner workings of the genre but the few other titles that I had played featured voice work. I think this would have given the game that extra layer of immersion that at times it may have needed. However, this is something that I am certain costs a significant amount of money. It is also something that having played other games can make or break a game. If the team was unable to budget for this inclusion to be done properly then it may have been a wise decision not to include this feature. As a result I am not going to be overly critical.\n\nAlthough I’m not certain that I’ll make visual novels a cornerstone of my gaming experience I can honestly say that if someone were to advise me of a great one that I wouldn’t turn my nose up at them and question where is the gaming. An Octave Higher is a title that I can recommend to people, like myself, who were relatively new to the genre.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 11","true","6.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The only constraint to use magic is the consumption of mana potions, unfortunately the market is regulated by the state who maintains artificially high prices which means only the richer classes and the corporations are able to acquire them. The only employement possibility for the lower classes is heavy factory work (using magic) where they provided with barely enough mana to work through their shift.\n\nThe main part of the story concerns Franz, a student who has been assigned a difficult (if not impossible) thesis project to find practical applications of "compassion" magic which is primarily use to heal and give energy to living beings.\nLured by a candidate sponsor in the poorest part of the city, he stumbles on a young girl, Elise, while she was trying to revive a broken piano using compassion magic. Seeing some potential for his thesis, he convince her and his mentor to employ her as his assistant... In parallel you'll witness a growing revolution led by a underground group called Libertad which aims to break lower class's dependency to the bourgeoisie for the access to mana potions.\n\n\nThis VN will keep you busy for 8-10h (I'm a fast reader) with a enjoyable story and 5 different endings. They extensively explain the various magic concepts (formulas, systems, machines...) and the depiction of magic duels is very dynamic.\nThe art is pretty and original and the characters have a large set of facial expressions. Special mention for the classical music soundtrack with a very catchy main theme.\n\nOnly downside would be the total lack of voices and the relatively shortness.

It's set in the grand city of Overture, where magic has become a science that's fuelling an industrial revolution, resulting in the mass-scale production of magical machines. Since magic is used to do everything from cooking to driving, being able to afford the necessary mana potions is what separates the upper class from the lower class. Some reviews complain that it's too heavy on lore and explanations, but I really appreciate the detail, which is interesting and provided in context.\n\nThe story is told through the alternating perspectives of three main characters: Frederic Godwin, an aristocrat/GIANT D.O.U.C.H.E.B.A.G; Franz Byron, a student/researcher at the Conservatoire; and Elise Shelley, an orphaned factory worker who quickly captures Franz's attention with her special compassion magic abilities. It's supported by a number of minor characters, such as Frederic's overbearing father, Lord Joff Godwin, who founded the Magical Mechanical factory where Elise works; Franz's Professor Johann Poe; Commander Janis Woolf of the Dragoon police unit; Franz's best friend, Aretha Blyton (who is my favourite character because she's smart and funny and likes to bust Franz's balls) and her psychiatrist mother, Alanis; Elise's best friend, Jude; and members of Libertad, a radical proletariat group who are leading the uprising.\n\nThe narrative is well-written, the plot is engaging, the art style is beautiful, and the classical soundtrack is fitting. There are a number of decisions that need to be made along the way, and the first path that I followed (which gave me the Egregia ♥♥♥ laude achievement!) led to Franz and Aretha graduating from the Conservatoire with honours (despite Franz's research project not going quite as well as it could have) and the defeat of Libertad by the ruling class. A bunch of other stuff happened as well, but I don't want to give it all away! There are six possible endings, so I'm eager to play through it again, partly because I'm addicted to getting Steam achievements, but mostly because I want to see Franz and Aretha fall in love... and I'm hoping for a revolution ^.^","March 31","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's not a ton to do in the game, only 10 choices total ( maybe a few more for some endings). Like many visual novel games, there are multiple endings with one "Real" ending. To get all the endings it took about 8 hours. I love the graphics/artwork, and the "Real" story is pretty intense and well written. You get the persepctive of 3 characters, 2 male, and 1 female, and you get to make choices as each character. It's a lot of fun and I hope you enjoy it!","January 18","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love it since I tried several endings but I still havent figured out all the endings","January 26","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story was engaging regardless, and I am now aiming to see all other endings. TRIGGER WARNING for some: There is a mild ♥♥♥♥ attempt scene. The characters were likeable, with the exception to one in particular. The music got a little repetitive, but if you're a classical music fan, you will be thrilled by some surprise pieces. Over all, I give this game a yes. I would perhaps wait until it's on sale like I did.","March 28","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It wasn’t what I was expecting but I’m really glad that I stuck with it and experienced it. It would have been nice to  have a little bit more input. The game is more of an interative story but not like a telltale game. The options are much more limited but the story is so well done, it keeps you wanting to progress. The game has about 6 different endings. One of the best option, you can fastforward to skip stuff you already read to try different options to get different endings. You will spend countless hours getting all the endings to complete the story.\n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is in it's writing.  The people writing the story apparently don't know the difference between Capitalism, Plutocracy and monopolies. In one of the endings it blames capitalism for the suffering of people but in reality what the story actually describes is a Plutocracy and a monopoly leading to the suffering of people. It does take away from one of the endings.","May 14","true","13.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An Octave Higher is a fun little visual novel in which the choices you make determine the ending you get. Some are good, others bad, but the real ending you gotta work for it.\n\nThe music is piano set pieces, a few are from well known artists, and the hand-drawn backgrounds look beautiful and provide an atmosphere to the game. Though I wish they altered them a bit to show the passage of time. The characters might seem two-dimensional at first, but subsequent playthroughs reveal more about them than what meets the eye.\n\nIf you want a fun little visual novel to enjoy, I recommend it, especially to people who love the piano.","June 6","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
