It is presented well. However, this game implements 8-bit style graphics. While this can be done well, it was done poorly in this situation. It is butt-ugly. This game also does not allow keyboards to be used. This game is on the PC and should be able to do so. I do not own a joystick. As such, gameplay was not decent and the controls were very unintuitive. The music is present and seems to be decent, but I was only able to listen to the start menu music. This game does count towards number of steam games and has trading cards. As such, I would pay 50 cents for the game.\n\nIf you are reading this and are the developer, please add keyboard controls. I do want to try this game.\n\nNote: I recieved a key for this game in a giveaway.","March 20","false","15.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It prompts you to press a button. Consequently press every button you have on your keyboard. The game eventually realizes you did press something and starts a slideshow with unreadable text on it. I waited for several minutes, but still failed to derive whether slides move on their own or in response to me pressing any particular button.\n(Alt+F4 was my last resort. Oops, Alt+F4 doesn't work either. Had to fire it externally.)\nWaited for 10 minutes, closed and uninstalled. 40 orlygift credits thrown away.\n\nEDIT: Just realized from developer's comments that it is not even supposed to be played on keyboard, it's designed for X-BOX controllers. No idea what I'm doing here.","March 19","false","0.2"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","75","9","12","9","0"

The gameplay needs several improvements. The commands in the menus are very awkward, but not bad in-game. The UI needs to be redesigned. I'd put the character slightly to the left, or in the side of the screen opposite to where I'm going. I don't like that I insta-kill the enemies, because it's not fun. Finally, sounds and graphics could be improved, because they aren't good at all.","March 22","false","0.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Bottom of the barrel for steam, a new low.\n\nEdit_ So I tried the dev's solution (which is quite ridiculous, this is the first time I ever had to do something like this for a controller to work with any modern game) but I'm still going to leave the negative review because the game is just as bad as the graphics and the controller optimization. It controls horribly and it's just annoying to do anything on it, also, the sprites look like something an eight year old would do on a boring afternoon using ms paint, cringe on every level, not even worthy of the trading cards or the fact that I got this for free and I still feel ripped off.","March 18","false","3.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/puddykitia/recommended/397700/","puddykitia","Puddykitia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/puddykitia/","30 products in account","I really like this game. It's not a triple A title, I believe it was developed by one guy, but I can tell he put a lot of love into it. I've only gotten past the second boss so far but am enjoying my time played!\n\nIt's a platform game that's doesn't try to throw any sort of gimmicky mechanics to it. It has a nice retro platformer feel to it. There's a huge variety of playable characters to choose from, each having a melee and a ranged weapon. These weapons seem to have slightly different functions for each character. For example, some of the ranged weapons' projectiles fire straight forward, some of them will lob/fall.\n\nThe levels are challenging and very few of them I was able to get through with out dying at least once. It becomes more challenging each level and new mechanics (like jump pads) are introduced at a nice pace.\n\nThe artwork may not seem that well polished to most people, but to me it's an amazing mix of retro and MS Paint, giving it a very unique feel. I especially like the artwork for the monsters. The music is catchy and appropriate.\n\nIt seems like the voice for the game is done by a child, which is off putting at first but eventually it sort of grew on me, especially when I started figuring out how to get combos and got to hear "Amazing!"\n\nMy only major issue with the game is that you should make sure you save often, because for me at one point I did something wrong in one of the levels and lost my progress and had to start over a few levels back.  Also, make sure you have a controller for this game, because it does not support keyboard. That's fine by me though, I prefer using controllers for platforming games","December 7, 2015","true","2.2"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"
