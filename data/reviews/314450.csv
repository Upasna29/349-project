Saviors, the 19 cent 2D shootemup, is good. I was not expecting this. No really, I was looking forward to tearing this game to pieces. Unfortunately for me, the only worthy complaint is the terrible character-models and bland art-direction. Once I actually played the game, it all came together quite nicely. This is a legitimately decent indie shooter.\n\nHumanity is doomed AGAIN, or maybe they're not doomed, or maybe I don't care. This threadbare and easily ignorable plot sets up 15 stages of shooting action. For an arcade 2D shooter, that's quite a lot. Thankfully, these stages are well-paced, with only 5 of them having real boss-fights. Furthermore, your first experience with this game is liable to be the story mode, where the large number of stages seems a bit more sensible.\n\nIn story mode, you're given the choice of three pilots, each with their own ship. As you play through the stages, you'll gather experience, which leads to level-up perks. Also, in-between stages you can decide on primary, secondary, and side weapons. There's an interesting amount of strategy, that's tempered by good old-fashioned reflexes. The better you do, the higher your score, which also ties into your experience. The level of difficulty can also be changed, just in case things get too easy or too difficult. The other modes remove the stage to stage decision-making. Instead you're given a choice between various ships and weapon-systems. All you have to do is select the setup that suits your play-style.\n\nWith Saviors, unlike most shooters, you always have an idea of what's approaching. There are constant indicators for every enemy ship, so you can focus on either destroying them immediately, or let them stay on-screen for a bit, so you can maintain your chain combo. Each ship has their own arsenal and pattern. As you progress you'll face newer ships in greater numbers. Another aspect that is unlike most shooters is the fact that you get a shield. Obviously it's not something to be relied upon, but it comes in handy for those stray shots. The boss-fights tend to be bullet-hell affairs. All you really have to do is hang back, fire away, and dodge for seemingly an eternity. For most players, the normal difficulty provides a sufficient challenge.\n\nSaviors has a good "flow" to it. There are new dangers or problems to deal with in every stage, but nothing too absurd that it changes the nature of the game. The mechanics are also fairly solid, none of the damage you'll take will feel cheap. Although, sometimes the game can get a little too busy with the explosions. On the bright side, this tends to happen during "break" mode, where enemies and their projectiles explode frequently. It's very satisfying, though sometimes tough to control.\n\nAs far as other complaints go, I think bosses tend to take a little too long. Their last sliver of energy takes forever to drain away, even if I unload all of my limited secondary weapons on it. Each ship also has their own speed setting. While it's nice to have a faster ship for reaching enemies quickly; more often than not, I'd rather have slow-movement for those waves of bullets I need to dodge. Otherwise it's mostly nitpicks, like some perks not being very useful.\n\nSaviors is a very nice surprise. It has solid mechanics, a decent amount of variety, enough replay-value to last, and it will likely cost you a penny or two after selling the cards. It just might be worth your time.","July 23, 2015","true","8.1"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","26","31","2","0"

The price is also suspiciously low. But don't let that fool you, because Star Staviors is a surprisingly decent and well made indie shmup, with a lot to offer.\n\nThe game is clearly inspired by some of the more popular titles in the genre, in a good way. It is simple and easy to get into, yet offers numerous game modes, difficulties, ship types and weapons to choose from. From what I've played on normal it seems fair, and the controls are responsive enough. The challenge is there, the shooting is enjoyable, and numerous achievements and modes encourage multiple playthroughs.\n\nThe game surely is not perfect and could have been improved in some areas, but as a whole it is really good. Simply put, I've had a lot of fun with with it. More so than with many other shmups, that are way more expensive and more hyped up. Great and catchy soundtrack also certainly adds a lot to the overall enjoyment.","January 2","true","4.2"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","0"

Now, my game library is filled with "hey, this is a pretty good game, let's put it aside for later" stuff, which I tend not to ever start up again. So saying that I finished a game in one setting is pretty exceptional in itself.\n\nBasically it is a fairly standard shoot 'm up with bullet-hell bosses. Normally I despise bullet-hells, but here it was not so bad at all. Consider it a bullet-hell-light if you want.\n\nYou get the typical top-down view most of the time, with occasionally switched camera perspectives. We've seen it all countless times in these sort of games but it continues to impress.\n\nGrapically the game is underwhelming. The "3D" avatars that brief you in between missions are of a quality you would expect from games of 1996, the ships lack animation and the UI is fairly boring. Still, the ship design is pretty good from a Sci-Fi point of view and, while boring and uninspired, the UI offers exactly what you want from it, without distracting. The 3D backgrounds are nice as well although don't expect Crysis-levels of backdrops for this price.\n\nSpeaking about the briefings, the story is forgettable as well. The Earth is once again in danger yadda yadda yadda. But who cares about a story in this type of game anyway?\n\nThe sound is meh. The fighting sounds OK but not more than that. The soundtrack is pretty good, FAR better than you would would expect from such a cheap game. Too bad there are only 3 or so tracks.\n\nThe gameplay on the other hand it outstanding. Shooting just feels great. There is also plenty of choice in weapons and it is a joy to combine the different weapon types to build your own little ship of doom (trademark pending). The levels are also short and vary in background, so you really are driven to see what comes next. The "one more turn" is strong with this one!\n\nThe developers included a very clever "break" scoring mechanic, that awards a high score multiplier with mass-explosions, replacing the screen-wiping bomb you usually get in SHMUPS with chain-reactions of fire and death. This is an excellent choice and seeing screen after screen of enemies explode is soooo rewarding, you will want to drive up your multiplier even if you don't care about highscores at all.\n\nThere is also a level-up system, awarding good scores even more. The unlockable perks are not extra-ordinary, but do allow you to customise your ship to your liking. There are five attributes to build up and  I went full defence for example, while other peeps will want to go full offence. Similarly, you can choose from between 3 different ships at the start.\n\nYou can finish the game in about 90 minutes, which was just good enough. Any longer might have been too repetitive.\n\nSummarizing: this is a hidden gem. Whether you are new to shoot-em-ups or like the genre, you can't really do bad with this purchase.\n\nScore:\n\nGameplay: 8/10\nGraphics: 5/10\nSound: 6/10\nDifficulty: 6/10\nValue-for-money: 9/10","July 20, 2015","true","3.4"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","14","21","0","0"

This is exactly the sort of gem you hope to find from small indie teams.\n\nThe graphics and music are above average, the control is tight, there are a lot of options to customize your experience, and several different game modes to keep you going.\n\nThere are 18 levels to complete to make it through the story.  After each mission you are allowed to pick perks, as well as customize your main, secondary and special weapon.  As you get deeper in the game more options unlock.  You can also choose one of three pilots, and each ship has its own unique flavor.  Missions are a mix of standard enemies and bosses.  Most moves are telegraphed ahead of time, giving you a split second to plan your next move.  You can also alternate your fire between going all guns forward for full damage, or split your damage three ways and shoot ahead of you and to each side.\n\nThe story sections are the weakest portion of the game.  There is nothing unique, the writing is not very natural, and the pilots don't look great in the speaking sections.  There is an alien invasion, and only your commander saw it coming, now go blow everything up.  The end.  Fortunately, all story sections can be skipped.\n\nVery worthwhile game if you enjoy this type of shooter.

The gameplay is not comparable to normal shmups. That's ment in a bad way. The gameplay just feels plain. . The design  hits the standards , but is more generic than outstanding.

But you don't get an arcad-ish feeling, when playing. That's propably the reason why I dislike this game. The game can be very challenging in the harder difficulties which is awesome. however, the graphics are kind of a downer in that part. The changed breakmode is also less interesting to me, as it feels not like if you are killing things faster that way.","December 11, 2014","false","13.4"," 19 of 35 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","19","35","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/314450/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","Okay, is this game Saviors or Star Saviors? It's called Star Saviors on the main page, but the actual picture's title and the title on my download list says "Saviors". Well, which is it, Steam?\n\nBefore I go completely off track, I was mildly surprised by Star Saviors. I know the Bullet Hell audience (a couple of my friends are part of that niche), and let me just say that they can be about as damned annoying as anime/manga fans.  Especially when a new Bullet Hell game comes out! Well, I decided to try this one out just for craps and giggles, and was a little more surprised with what I got than what I was expecting. This game isn't a masterpiece, but I had a lot of fun- while I was expecting a more dull game.\n\nStar Saviors functions like the classic "your ship moving constantly forward, with all the other ships trying to blow you up", fashion. You fly, and you shoot. But what Saviors has that made me love it a lot more than the old 1940's plane games I used to tear up back in the day, is that those amazing weapon upgrades that'd normally disappear in one hit in those arcade games are full-on upgrades you can unlock and combine with your weapons in whatever style you want, to maximize damage. No specific pattern of bullets is better than the other, since they all upgrade in damage at the same time, and that I really, really liked. Even the upgradeable perks system was a nice touch.\n\nNow, there IS a huge difficulty curve in this game you have to get over, and it can be a bit annoying at times, when you've got a sliver of health left on a boss and you die and have to start all the way back at the beginning, but it still manages to be fun with all the adversity I faced- and I even found it addicting.\n\nThe story's short (as the main game's campaign is roughly 2 hours), but it's a little bit better than other indie arcade-reminiscent games I've played in a while. Mind you, I'm not saying this is Oscar-material. The enemies have no personality, and the guy and girl that follow you do no service to the plot (and honestly, no one on your Saviors team actually helps you shoot down enemies, which is weird at the end on one of your teammates says, "I shot the most of them!"... BS! I shot ALL of them!"). And the character's faces look like a clay face forced back into an uncomfortable stare that are being telepathically controlled through their lips... It's honestly creepy to look at. But as far as characterization goes with the father and son, gave a small but nice touch. The other plot points were nonsensical and did nothing at all for me, but the moments when your dad encourages you and wants to make sure you stay safe were a slight touch of "something more" that this game has.\n\nAgain, it's not perfect. The plot is really pointless, as you aimlessly fly from zone A to be, gunning down enemies, finishing a boss fight, and doing... something to forward your progress on saving your home planet. But it's still a fun game to throw 20 cents on. It's certainly worth that.","October 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Depending on the mode you play, you will have choices of ships.  There are 9 variants in arcade and survival that you play through the whole game with whichever you choose, while story lets you choose one of three base ships that can be customized with perks and three weapons of your picking.\n\nThis game is actually quite difficult, past easy and also normal after a few tries, it really kicks your ♥♥♥.  EDIT: There is actually a practice mode under new game, if you're going to play hard or insane you better practice the stages because the game is long and very difficult past normal.\n\nThe soundtrack is probably the highlight of this game, it is actually quite good and I will remember the boss theme for some time to come.\n\nI see this game on sale often, if you play shmups and want something a little different than a traditional shmup these days, this might help to kill some time and at 2 dimes you're not losing anything trying it out.  For full price, I would tread carefully unless you like the customization idea via Tyrian or older PC shmups or if you are already a shmup veteran.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/314450/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","Okay, is this game Saviors or Star Saviors? It's called Star Saviors on the main page, but the actual picture's title and the title on my download list says "Saviors". Well, which is it, Steam?\n\nBefore I go completely off track, I was mildly surprised by Star Saviors. I know the Bullet Hell audience (a couple of my friends are part of that niche), and let me just say that they can be about as damned annoying as anime/manga fans.  Especially when a new Bullet Hell game comes out! Well, I decided to try this one out just for craps and giggles, and was a little more surprised with what I got than what I was expecting. This game isn't a masterpiece, but I had a lot of fun- while I was expecting a more dull game.\n\nStar Saviors functions like the classic "your ship moving constantly forward, with all the other ships trying to blow you up", fashion. You fly, and you shoot. But what Saviors has that made me love it a lot more than the old 1940's plane games I used to tear up back in the day, is that those amazing weapon upgrades that'd normally disappear in one hit in those arcade games are full-on upgrades you can unlock and combine with your weapons in whatever style you want, to maximize damage. No specific pattern of bullets is better than the other, since they all upgrade in damage at the same time, and that I really, really liked. Even the upgradeable perks system was a nice touch.\n\nNow, there IS a huge difficulty curve in this game you have to get over, and it can be a bit annoying at times, when you've got a sliver of health left on a boss and you die and have to start all the way back at the beginning, but it still manages to be fun with all the adversity I faced- and I even found it addicting.\n\nThe story's short (as the main game's campaign is roughly 2 hours), but it's a little bit better than other indie arcade-reminiscent games I've played in a while. Mind you, I'm not saying this is Oscar-material. The enemies have no personality, and the guy and girl that follow you do no service to the plot (and honestly, no one on your Saviors team actually helps you shoot down enemies, which is weird at the end on one of your teammates says, "I shot the most of them!"... BS! I shot ALL of them!"). And the character's faces look like a clay face forced back into an uncomfortable stare that are being telepathically controlled through their lips... It's honestly creepy to look at. But as far as characterization goes with the father and son, gave a small but nice touch. The other plot points were nonsensical and did nothing at all for me, but the moments when your dad encourages you and wants to make sure you stay safe were a slight touch of "something more" that this game has.\n\nAgain, it's not perfect. The plot is really pointless, as you aimlessly fly from zone A to be, gunning down enemies, finishing a boss fight, and doing... something to forward your progress on saving your home planet. But it's still a fun game to throw 20 cents on. It's certainly worth that.","October 28, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In all honesty, I probably wouldn't be playing a shoot-'em-up otherwise.\nThat said, I'd be missing out. Saviors is a pretty fun game. It's frantic enough to be challenging, but not so much to be horribly frustrating. The soundtrack isn't half bad, either.\n\nAnyway, at $5.49 CAD regular price, Saviors is well worth the price of admission. If you find it on sale (as I mentioned above), you're practically stealing it.","August 3, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this game cause it was 19 cents, and I figured I could get some cards and sell them and basically have a free game. Didn't really expect much since there are many Bullet Hells on Steam and most are of questionable quality. Aside from that, I don't really like the genre much. So... what could possible change any of that, right?\n\nWell... this game could. Although it's campaign has a flinter-thin plot, filled with Engrish and cringe-worthy dialogue it's rather fun to go through. The game looks good, plays good,  and yes, it sounds great (that's some great OST there). It gives precognition of enemies to come so you can always prepare (even though sometimes that can really clutter the screen and can be confusing between what's there and what to come) and thus lacks any unfair "surprise" others of the genre so love. Any opposition is actually fair to fight. In the campaign it also allows some minor choices of what you want to improve in (offensive, defensive, missiles etc.) which works well. I went full on damage and shields myself.\n\nConclusion; If this game can appease someone not liking the genre, it's definitely a must-get for all who do. And if you're like me, go ahead, give it a try. You may be positively surprised. And if not, well, you lost 5 cents... That's got to be one of the best gambles you'll ever get ;)","September 22, 2015","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was totally wrong.\nThis is a hell of a game, with simple but effective graphics and great gameplay, like Zero Wing or similars. You can't expect a so-deep-I-can-see-Adelle-rolling plot, but it's good enough for the context.\nDespite the prejudgements, the story mode didn't let me sleep the entire night, but I cut it off when died like fifty times against the same boss; really frustating. But when I woke up I beated the sh*t out of him.\nThis game has the difficulty that many lacks, it's a challenge.\n\nNow, let's begin with the pros and cons (though I haven't beated the final boss yet):\n\nPROs: Wide weapon options.\nThree ships, with different characteristics.\nCool explosions.\nDynamic levels.\nZero Wing nostalgia.\nArcade and survival modes.\nKick-♥♥♥ OST, it's really great. I bought it as DLC.\nI'm in the scoreboard list!!\nThis isn't a "piece of cake" game. It may be short, but really defiant.\nDespite the difficulty, it's fair (Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane).\nGives you the feel of "YEAH I DID IT I WENT THROUGH THIS SH*T!!!!" when you beat a boss.\nCONs: Characters' faces aren't the best.\nKen's not just an arrogant Vegeta-like guy, he's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, seriously. What the hell is wrong with him?\nLittle problems to get into the scenario at early levels, but later it figures out.\nAnnoying bug against the laser's boss, when you stomp against the... Floor?\nTo finish: Buy this game if you spare a few bucks, you won't regret it, specially if you like this kind of arcade and starships games.

But it is fun like others ? like hell it is (no pun intended).\n\nGraphics - Buller hell games really don't need that much graphic power, with using simple meshes (like this game does) it works perfectly. But this just can't be overlooked, the character models are taken out of a nightmare, and just put in there to haunt you for the rest of your life. If you can just pass this simple detail, everything else is fine. 6/10\n\nMusic - Empowering, just the music it needs for the type of game it is. Mostly heard is metal, with a few dubstep sounds mixed within. If you love that kind of music, you are going to love this game. 7/10\n\nCinematics - None\n\nStory - You as the reader, have probably heard this story over and over again, the story where you are the chosen one and you have to save the world. Now this may come as a suprise, but this game actually changes it (no it doesn't). You follow a relatively average campaign through the galaxy to prevent a war that is going to unfold at any moment. Also the game tells you multiple times that you are the chosen one, and that you are the only one who can do what you are doing. Although at the start of the campaing, you are given the choice between 3 characters, and while you are doing what you are doing, the other 2 characters are doing the same, but remember how you are the only one capable of doing this ? Well you are not. 5/10\n\nContent - For a game this cheap, it does have quite a bit of stuff hidden within it. A story campaign, which is roughly 18 missions, 3 character choices at the start, which have quite a bit of background story to them. Futhermore, the more you advance through the story, the more weapons and perks you unlock for your skills. Oh forgot to mention that each of the playable characters have a different playstyle. The first one is slow but with hard hiting weapons, the other one is fast with low to average damage, and the last one is average speed with average damage. Also it does other modes, separate from the campaign one. 8/10\n\nControls - Responds perfectly to any command that you give, which is a must have for these type of games. 8/10\n\nGameplay - Really fast paced, you don't have time to think about what you are going to do, as you are bombarded all the time. It does get progressively harder with every level, as it is expected. The bosses man were they hard, mostly that one at the 13'th level, but nothing a second (if only it were 2 tries) attempt couldn't fix. 7/10\n\nIn spite of that, Star Saviors is a pretty solid entry for a game this cheap. It does have its flaws as does every game, but it does way too many things really well, that you can just look past the flaws. If you like these type of games, you won't regret buying this one.\n\nFinal Score: 6.8/10","January 30","true","10.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

А в отсальном - все по стандартам.\nСюжет - все как обычно. Прищельцы, безащитность человечества, единственная надежда на нескольких избранных, защита родной матушки-земли, путь до планеты прищельцев и соттветственно ее выжигание... вот и все...\nГрафон - ничего особенного... хотя... взрывы выглядят как-то неестественно...\nГеймплей - абсолютная классика.

A good selection of modes. A variety of weapons.

It Shows with % based.\nYou can see your own statistics.\nYou are able to play this game with a xbox controller.\nYou are able to play LOCAL CO-OP.\nIt has a story Mode, Arcade mode,  Survival mode, Practice Mode and Tutorial mode.\nExplained Tutorial.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou are a Spaceship and your job is to kill enemies. Your hitbox is in the middle of the ship. Killing enemies will give you a multiplier. A high multiplier will kill other enemies more easier because the ship explosion will be bigger too. Your score will also increase but nobody cares about highscore anyway. However it does require to level up your ship level. You are able to choose between 3 Pilots with each of their own effects. The background surrounding moves and has some effect into the game aswell.\n\nGraphics isn't that super amazing, but doable.\nAble to skip Text Dialogue's.\nYou are able to choose 3 Pilots with their own style and effects.\n\nBackground graphics are very well done i have to say. It's something simple but you do have the feeling you are flying over a building and background is changing/moving and rotating aswell. Not only that, if there is a Building in your way you will take damage from this aswell.\n\nYou have a Level up system.\nYou can change the weapons on the ship.\nLevel Music's are pretty good and has variety.\nYou can't switch ships in between levels. Unless you want to start on level 1 again.\n\nSlow Pilot: Shots are more wide and spread out.\nMedium Pilot: Shorts are at the average speed and medium spread out.\nFast Pilot: Shots are fast but the damage is low. Doesn't have Spread shots.\n\n\n\nOther things.\nI am not really a plane or pilot fan, but i have actually enjoyed the game. I think mainly to the music. Secondly the background.\n\nR.I.P Eyes\n\nDon't start With score attack yet until you completed the game or don't give a Fox anymore. It will remove your Save state in STORY MODE and that means you have to start on level 1 again.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 7/10","April 30","true","3.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The enemies simply use your keyboard input as a targeting mechanic, the result being similar to the simple plastic mechanical games that you used to find at dollar stores. I was a huge fan of Galaga. I played it wherever I could find it. My friends always knew when I was younger that, if I went missing, to just look for the closest Galaga game. I love the format, but this doesn't do it justice.\n\nBeyond that, I found the dialog irritating. The author seemed to think they were being witty, or tongue-and-cheek, but it just came across as childish and ignorant. What the teacher says during the tutorial, for instance, stands behind the premise that you have somehow forgotten what you're doing and constantly surfaces how silly it is. The author is trying to say that tutorials are silly in the first-place, as your character should already know what they're doing. Of course, a tutorial is always needed when undertaking a new task. Why would we assume our character isn't just learning how to fly a ship? Why would we imply that they already know how to fly one, but have just forgotten for some reason?\n\nSorry, I just had to rant. It's a top-down shooter; you could care less about the dialog. So, then, in conclusion: This game is a horrible example of the format with nothing to elevate it beyond others in its genre and isn't worth the 19 cents I paid for it. I've uninstalled it and can safely say that not even the most boring of Saturday afternoons can make me second-guess that decision.","October 31, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Fortunately, Star Saviors has a lot of things going for it that make it absolutely worth playing, particularly if you're new or not so skilled at shmup/bullet hell games.\n\nA major talking point is the price. It's very low for a game with as much content and competence on display here, and in a way I almost feel like the price sends a message that the game is crappier than it is. However, there's a very noticable low-poly almost amateur level to the character models and story presentation, but in a shmup game this isn't of importance and it's bizarre how much the story is pushed by the developers considering their study of the "shmup greats".\n\nBut enough of all that, you say, how does it play? For a one dollar game, pretty damn well. I jacked it up to 1440p and blazed ahead at 120 fps, with smooth movement and easy dodging using a Dualshock 4. Games like Ikaruga have a certain elegance to the way the enemies approach and attack you, and in many ways a perfect run of a shmup like that is a beautifully coreographed dance between the player and the AI. In Star Saviors' case many enemies just come at you without an identifiable pattern, but it's clear a lot of throught and time was put into making sure that it felt good to shoot the enemies and to have bullet patterns that are always dodgable.\n\nAs a veteran of this genre, I thought the game was quite easy at first. The ships have a shield that can take a hit before you start losing "hull damage", meaning that you can fail to dodge quite a bit before losing a life. If you are a veteran, however, Star Saviors has multiple difficulty modes and customizations to tailor the experience to you. To be clear: You can approach this game at any skill level with the genre and have a good time, with veterans missing some more advanced systems and newbies able to ease themselves into the genre using this game without being overwhelmed at the start.\n\nIkaruga has a brilliant chaining system with the color changing, Radiant Silvergun had a massive variety of attacks on one ship as well as chaining based on the colors of the enemies. Sine Mora has a beautiful presentation of it's story and art design. Star Saviors does not meet any of the lofty levels of these greats, but the price is an unaviodable factor that makes it much easier to accept the things it does do right. If you love this genre and play it to death, a buck towards these devs might help to allow them to continue refining their craft and maybe realize their dream of releasing an epic-tier shmup. You'll have a good time regardless on the higher levels, and the RPG-like ship customizations after each story level offers a nice change of pace. If anyone has made it this far and has an interest in the genre, but might feel intimidated by the often high level of difficulty and skill required - this is absolutely your excellent starting point and the price couldn't be easier to swallow to see if these kind of games can be for you. If it turns out that they are, do realize that there's a next level and proceed to move on to more pricey but higher quality titles like Astebreed, Ikaruga, Radiant Silvergun, and any game made by Cave.\n\nStar Saviors may not reach the high goals set by the titles it aspires to, but it's amazing that a $1 title can even make an honest attempt at that level. I recommend it to anyone who's curious or even anyone who enjoys arcade space shooters. I'd say the amount of words and time I've spent even talking about a game at this price level should say a lot.","May 8","true","12.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It throws you right into the heart of a laser-heavy space battle and lets somebody else do the explaining. In honor of that, I will try to be brief.\n\nSaviors is a "gamer's game." It is fully aware that it is a game, and seems to be fine if you are, too. Immersion is only one path to greatness as a video game product, and this game shows that you don't need to re-invent the wheel if you've got a really good wheel.\n\nThe gameplay is incredibly smooth. Three buttons and arrows, and go get 'em, tiger. I had never heard the slang term "bullet hell" for the scrolling shooter genre, but it took about twenty-five seconds to make perfect sense. Saviors nails a very difficult design concept: the controls should fit like a glove, but that doesn't mean that every task should be intuitive. A few formations will make you think twice or leave you guessing, but unlike so many games that use unpredictability and no-win situations to cheaply raise difficulty, you can always hunker down in Saviors and juice a little more playtime out of sheer instinct.\n\nMy big complaint - and the reason that I don't recommend it for everybody, everywhere, is that its presentation is that of several very good parts that don't make a cohesive whole. I have to admit that I do favor the ability to immerse myself in a game world, and each of the elements here don't quite go together. The sprites and particles have different reflective properties, and neither quite look like they are a part of the world painted by the backgrounds. The soundtrack is vivid and pulse-pounding, but it sounds like it was for a completely different game and overpowers the sound effects by default. For this style of game, I get that many gamers mute the game audio and throw on their own esoteric techno or speed-metal soundtracks, but as a casual gamer, I like to see the little touches that give me more than a series of well-designed levels: they give me a world to play through.\n\nSaviors gets truly difficult, but it definitely starts off at an inviting level, so people new to the genre (like me) can work their way in. At all levels, though, it gets perhaps the most important part of this genre right: you will have one or two moments per level where you ask yourself, "How on earth did I get myself out of that one?" It's intense and addictive. This is a superbly-designed game at a very attractive price. If you like space shooters at all, or want to find out if you do, buy right away.","July 30, 2015","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I skipped any further dialog once the tutorial was finished.\n\nThe third level where you fight one of the first major bosses is where the game starts to shine, and it gets better from there.\nYou've got to be good at dodging hundreds of bullets all flying around the screen at once for those boss fights though. I haven't tried anything above normal difficulty at the moment, but I'm certain to give the higher difficulties a serious try later.\nEdit: finished insane story mode.

Sunt cel mai multumit jucator, grafica, modul in care acel chelbos da din buze cand vorbeste, fantastic domnule. Uimitor.

That being said, it's stable, runs well on this bucket-o'-bolts, and it's enjoyable.  The story mode isn't deep, but you don't need anything crazy intense to justify a shmup like this, anyways.

I got the game for like .79 cents with a coupon so it was a no brainer, but even for the $4.99 it's hard to argue with. You could easily go through $5 at an arcade in a fraction of the time this game will give you. Now for a couple negatives.. The dialogue is all text and is pretty dry, you'll see what I mean if you buy it. The game is fairly short, but with a few different characters and difficulties to choose from you have some replayability options.

There are upgrades between levels, which are unlocked with your score: the higher the score, the more upgrade points you get. There seems to be some story in story mode, but I stopped reading around second level, because it is not very good.\nThe music is ok I guess, but I am very picky with this aspect.\nThe game does borrow some aspects from danmaku, but generally it remains a classic game.\nOverall, this is a very decent game, probably worth its full price and definitely worth its price with a discount.","September 22, 2015","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is an unexpected jewel of an arcade shooter. The story is completely forgettable (I started skipping the dialogue between missions) and mainly serves to sew together the variety of decent-looking levels. The action is very flashy and fast-paced (as is to be expected of a game in this genre) but accessible to a novice like myself. Between the wall of projectiles you'll find yourself dodging and the surprisingly competent soundtrack (which I ended up buying for another quarter), this game will keep you quite on edge.

The game has good structure, having options and tutorials presented from early on, with a good menu and start up. The game also has interesting mechanics in the form of choosing a start character for the story mode, all of them very handedly described for their positive and negative attributes.\n\nCommencing to the gameplay bit, the game still delivers: Great flow, decent soundtrack, interesting perks and weapons, and different modes to play. (story mode, arcade etc.) The difficulty system is also very useful in regards of how hard the game can be for inexperienced players.\n\nAll in all to summarize, this game is absolutely worth the buy and I would suggest it to any avid gamer with a love for the genre.","February 29","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Specifically the european PC breed of shooters with RPG elements. Fair bullet patterns, lots of upgrade fun, a full arcade mode and plenty of challenge. Music is awesome if not a bit repetitive. Backgrounds can leave a bit to be desired, but the graphics are mainly in the bullets, which look spectacular, with plenty of colour and variety. Story mode is long, I'm not sure how long, I'm 18 levels in. They're mostly all really well-designed levels, albeit a bit easy on Normal mode. It won't you go back to earlier levels and annihilate ♥♥♥♥ with your upgraded weapons, and you only earn upgrades if you survive the level you're playing. This means there's no grinding to be done, which is a plus, and you'll simply have to retry the levels until you can beat them. A level select at some point would be helpful to practice stages without going through the entire story mode. Getting stuck on a hard level can be frustrating since you can't go back to an earlier level to cool off, and you can't have multiple saved games, so you're stuck there unless you wanna start over from the beginning, but at least then you can use a different perks upgrade strategy if your previous one wasn't working. Earned weapons you can switch between anytime, and only the perks are permanent. But you can undo your *most recent* perks upgrade and pick a different one at (I believe) any point.\n\nMore to be written once I have some more time with the game.\n\nIf you're on the fence about this game, you've probly played a few lackluster euro-type shooters or you've noticed the slew of mediocre $2.00 shooters on Steam and other platforms. Well this is nothing like that, this is a super fun game that that uses many elements of the euro style without being weakened by sloppy design or cheap deaths. If you're not into the story mode and messing with weapon sets and perks, the arcade mode is perfect, you just pick a preset weapon configuration and that's what you have for the whole game. There's also a Survival Score Attack mode.\n\nDon't pay attention to any of the game's descriptions on Steam. This game has little to do with Raiden or Radiant Silvergun andf almost nothing to do with Ikaruga. It's also more about being a UK PC RPG STG than it is about being a bullet hell. There are fast bullets like Raiden and Various weapons, vaguely similar I guess, the RSG, but that's quite a stretch. I really feel the ad copy for this game gives the wrong impression. Think Tyrian 2000. This game is like Tyrian 2014, and all for the better.","December 21, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

I skipped any further dialog once the tutorial was finished.\n\nThe third level where you fight one of the first major bosses is where the game starts to shine, and it gets better from there.\nYou've got to be good at dodging hundreds of bullets all flying around the screen at once for those boss fights though. I haven't tried anything above normal difficulty at the moment, but I'm certain to give the higher difficulties a serious try later.\nEdit: finished insane story mode. It was very difficult.\n\nOverall, It's a very fun game.\nThe music is great! It was actually good enough to convince me to get the ost when it was on sale for 49 cents.\nThe graphics (If I pretend the talking animation doesn't exist.) are great.\nThe story...uh...well...It doesn't need one, but it has something resembling a story I guess.\n\nI definitely recommend this game.

The visuals during combat are amazing, and the areas you are flying in are richly detailed.

Sometimes spamming your weapons makes it harder to dodge, take certain boss levels slowly and balance offence and defence and finally, like with any game, the more you play it the easier it gets and you start to adapt to the style of play – there's also no shame in playing it on an easier difficulty to get the hang of it first!\n\n\nOverall Summary~\n\nI bought the game when it was on sale for 15p and it was literally worth every penny.\nIf you fancy a fast paced, spaceship shooting game to pass some time and distract you, buy this game when it's on sale, it's surprisingly fun.","July 27, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have some seriously deformed faces that look like they came out of the psone era of gaming. Don't let that hold you back though. The game has a really great electronic / rock soundtrack and plays very smoothly. It's a little easier than other bullet hell type of games but fits right in the middle of bullet hell and shoot em up. On normal mode, I usually die within the first 3 stages losing all my lives and being asked if I want to continue or not. In this game, I can make it through stages and I can see why they made this game a little easier. There is no continue in this game. You can only restart from the beginning of the stage and only have one life. However, you can upgrade your ships shield, fire power and self healing abilities to give you a fighting chance against all the enemies who will flood your screen who will test your reflex abilities and show no mercy.\n\nIt's a very fun game just like every shoot em up type of game.

Good.\n\nPerhaps the best thing about this game is that it is only 2 dollars and it gives you an amazing amount of gameplay for the price of just 2 candybars. In many ways Saviors is very, very similar to Revolution Ace or Raptor: Call of the Shadows. This is a "schmup" (Whatever that stands for) game which features multiple play modes but particularly focuses on a main campaign wherein you choose a ship and progress through a series of areas upgrading your ship as you go. The campaign is done fairly well as are the various other modes of play (survival, arcade etc.). This game really shines in terms of how many options it gives you, particularly the fact that this game can either be really easy or really hard depending on which difficulty you choose (and a moderate difficulty really is moderately difficult). On the downside, like in Revolution Ace and Raptor: Call of the Shadows, the environments you fly over just creep along in an incredibly lethargic manner. There really isn't very much of a thrilling sense of speed and to make matters worse, the environments you fly over tend to be fairly boring. Despite this downfall though, Saviors is still fairly fun and it's main campaign has a nice, though predictable, little story told using between-mission dialogue scenes (and bizarre, creepy, computer-generated misshapen character faces. I try to pretend that's just how humans ended up looking on that planet in the distant future).\n\n+Many different game modes to choose from and many, many different ship types to play, all unlocked from the start.\n\n+The main campaign is long and challenging and fun with a wonderfully done difficulty curve from easy up to extremely difficult. The main campaign gives you lots of upgrade and ship customization options as you progress and lets you reconfigure your ship if you need to redo an area.\n\n+Several difficulty levels. Easy really is easy. Hard really is hard.\n\n+Pretty good music though perhaps a bit too much of it is in a sort of odd happy-go-lucky style which dramatically decreases the game's sense of tension. But hey, at least it isn't frenetic Japanese techno music yet again.\n\n+The main campaign actually has a story (which it explains, in fairly shallow interpersonal terms using text only). Some of the dialogue can be funny. One character does nothing but mouth off at the guy giving you objectives and another character is completely fixated on making big explosions.\n\n+Nifty and important and well implemented control scheme which lets you fire certain weapons out the sides of your craft if you need to. Good, responsive controls in general.\n\n+Good screen and menu layout.\n\n+This game seems to be completely devoid of bugginess.\n\n+Seriously, you can get this game for 2.00 and it lasts almost as long as Raptor: Call of the Shadows.\n\n+/-Adequate graphics but the environments, particularly as drab and boring as they are (and overly clean looking) should have whizzed by at a great speed to add interest to the game's graphics but instead merely creepy along at a snail's pace making the game graphically boring.\n\n+/-Large variety of enemies but despite their variety the enemies and their projectiles are not very creative looking. In terms of gameplay the enemies tend to fight in a fairly bland and offer fairly conventional challenges to gamers familiar with this type of game.\n\n-Bizarrely animated and rendered character faces. Really, I'm not sure the developers of this game could have made a more creepy looking set of characters if they'd tried,\n\n-Mediocre and repetitive sound effects.\n\n-Fairly boring boss fights.\n\n-Despite the many different game modes, the bland enemies and boring boss fights and boring visuals make this game seem, well, boring after a while. Probably a good game to play just once in a while along with other, similar games. But hey, what can you expect for 2 dollars?","May 17","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
