Close the page :(\n\nPros: visuals and such: stunning design, not bad graphics, nice atmosphere and jokes, John de Lancie as Professor Quadwrangle, original story, price\nCons: actual gameplay: pretty short (there are some DLCs out there though), not many good puzzles, requires more jumping skills than thinking ones, freaking tons of blur\n\nThe long way:\nI love this game. Yeah, that simple, just as simple as the game is. It has nice design, good 3d-cartoon-like graphics and jokes which are really good (well, sometimes they aren't, but nothing is perfect in this world). The main problems are the puzzles and length of the game itself - I've run through it in ~6 hours, but I haven't got 100% completion though. Now about the puzzles. They are simple as well, but that's not good this time. You won't find any really hard-brainsmashing-cool-etc puzzles in this game - all of them are considerably easy.

The first dimension is 'fluffy' dimension, which makes objects lighter allowing you to carry them and place them on switches. The second, is heavy dimension, which makes objects heavier, the third is slow time and the fourth is reverse gravity. You can only be in one dimension at a time.\n\n+ The game offers a mix of puzzles and platforming. Some areas are strictly related to one or the other while other areas combine the two.  It provides a nice change in pace as you are not strictly doing one thing over and over again.\n\n+The most important part of a puzzle game is the balance between fun and challenging. This game does a great job of finding the right balance. Solving puzzles offers a satisfactory feeling and feels very rewarding.  The puzzles were not super easy nor were they impossible to solve, with careful thinking and planning you should have no problem with the game.\n\n+The game offers a nice art style that compliments the game\n\n+Every puzzle offers a time and shift goal offering a lot of replay ability if your into that sort of thing.\n\nThe Average:\n\n-The game takes place in your uncles mansion while he provides witty banter to you throughout your journey. The problem is the dialogue isn't very funny or witty and the voice acting annoyed me.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The ending is very lackluster\n\n-Despite the great puzzle design there will always be frustrating moments in a game like this. Too many times I wanted to jump off a platform and the game didn't register my jump, a problem with most 1st person platforming games\n\n-Though I loved the main game puzzle design the DLC levels are frustrating. I said there is a balance between fun and challenging and most of the DLC levels go way too far in the challenging category to the point where I was more frustrated than having fun.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI really enjoyed my time with this game and if you are looking for a solid puzzle game then this is worth checking out.\n","October 18, 2014","true","23.2"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","30","34","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/200010/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","In theory this is a game I should like. In fact, I WANTED to like it. John "Q/News Anchor from Crank" DeLancie as narration, time/space manipulation in a 3D puzzle environment, a distinct visual style, etc.\n\nHere is the problem, and to elaborate, I'm going to have to compare this game to Portal, which a lot of people did on its release due to one of Portal 1's designers (Kim Swift) leaving Valve to work on this title, which is a similar genre, let's be frank. Portal 1 worked because it was brief. It'd do a few things with a tool, then move on to something else, occasionally mashing all your obstacles up for a challenge room/test of what you'd learned. Part of what worked to keep this from getting stale was that you had hints and taunts from your omnipresent narrator/torturer, and part of it came down to the puzzles being tested to a good balance of "solvable but not instantly".\n\nQuantum Conundrum has most of these attributes, but in sort of a "they came back wrong" variety. John DeLancie is playing the same role of narrator/reason for being in this mess, but a lot of his hints are either weirdly couched in ways that you're not going to get them (and you will hear them 5 times as you try to figure them out, too), or just outright irritating. Between stages in the loading bridge areas you'll hear him spout what is basically monkey-cheese randomness about "his" predicament, but there's not much reason to care because he's the dude what trapped you in Deathtrap Manor by accident where he decided to design really, really overzealous laser beams everywhere. (I'm not entirely convinced the lasers work as intended: stuff that's just supposed to destroy items had a tendency to fire right through into my skull more than once, ending my run at a puzzle.) The puzzles are indeed short rooms to solve and then move on to the next "chamber", but there's not much chance at learning them and a few are just straight up blind luck. One in particular springs to mind as it has you choosing two or three different branch points on a conveyer belt and while it IS possible to backtrack on it, it's a real bear and a lot of them lead around corners or to paths you cannot immediately see are dead ends/death.\n\nThe other big Portal gripe I'm gonna throw out: in Portal, you get the gun, you get a few rooms of training, and then YOU HAVE THE GUN FULLY OPEN FOREVER. Quantum Conundrum gives you 4 seperate powers, which are clearly controller-mapped given how they show up on a keyboard, and then gives them to you and takes them away randomly from room to room, so that just as you earn something it's out the door for two stages, then you need to find the object in the level to swap it out with the other power, then... The juggling really makes the game more tedious than interesting, when I just want to play around with all these weird reality warping buttons instead of learn about DeLancie's fuzzy multidimensional friend who hid a bunch of barking robots all around the house*.\n\nI did not finish this game. I'm sure some people will bash me for that, but I'll be honest: I got halfway? Most of the way? through the second of four hubs, and when the puzzle was repeating the same "make object light, toss, turn on slow-mo to catch it" gameplay for a third room running, but this time with instadeath pits and sloppy wooden platforms to bounce between... I stopped. I realized that absolutely nothing in this game had any sort of charm or fun factor to keep me going. It wasn't even a CHALLENGING game, so long as you realize "Okay I have two powers what can they do" and "how to avoid lasers".\n\nThis has potential, and I'm sure that the writing isn't going to be a turn-off for some, because comedy's amazingly subjective, yadda yadda. I'M going to tell you "this game is a hot mess, avoid", but if you're remotely curious, it drops to like... $4 with all DLC constantly. Why not, it's your money.\n\n* Not a joke.","September 15, 2014","false","2.4"," 125 of 196 people (64%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","64","125","196","16","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/recommended/200010/","genoforprez","genoforprez","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genoforprez/","385 products in account","First half of the game: Thumbs up\nSecond half of the game: Thumbs down\n\nWelp I quit. I really liked this game when it first started, because I really enjoy first person puzzlers, and in a lot of ways this game is a great one, but it also kinda shoots itself in the face. The different "dimensions" (light, heavy, slow, reverse gravity) make for some really great puzzles and there a lot of puzzle chambers that were genuinely fun to solve and exactly what I expected when I purchased this game. These were the puzzle chambers where you had to use the four dimensions to maneuver blocks in the environment to press buttons, trip lasers, avoid lasers, drop a ball into a net, and other types of things. I remember really enjoying a particular puzzle chamber with a bunch of conveyers, and the trick to it was that you had to use reverse gravity to utilize the UNDER side of the conveyers as well as the top side. That was a fun discovery, and it was fun to execute on when I realized it.\n\nBut here is where the game is possibly going to ♥♥♥♥ you off and possibly make you quit. It is not ENOUGH in quantum conundrum to just solve the puzzle, because this is not just a puzzle game. The further you get into the game, the more the game becomes about physics, timing, and platforming---and in the most annoying way. We're talking about a situation, for just one example, where you have to position three blocks in such a way that they fall onto three conveyors at the same time, and those conveyors (hopefully) drop them onto a fourth conveyor in a (hopefully) straight line, so that they move into position under a gap where you can use reverse gravity to elevate them into a bridge position across the gap, then quickly use slow-time to hold them in position so you can use them as a series of platforms to jump across. BUT WAIT. The opposite side of the gap is blocked by a door that has to be opened with a button, but there is a 3 second delay between the time you press the button and the time the door opens, and the door will ONLY open if slow time is on at the EXACT MOMENT the door would open. So you have to try and figure out the exact timing to press the button, press reverse gravity, then press slow time. Or is it press reverse gravity, THEN press the button, THEN slow time? How much of a pause do I leave between each one? Who knows? Good look setting up the solution 50 times until you trial-and-error work it out. And then when you finally DO figure out the timing, the game's physics dropped the safes onto the conveyor all sloppy so they're not lined up well, so when you try to execute some crappy first-person-platforming (let's face it: FPS platforming is always kinda crappy) across them, you miss the third safe and have to set it all up AGAIN. And again. And again. This all gets very f***ing tedious and sometimes even feels like there is an element of luck to it (i.e. how the physics works out), which is not a good situation.\n\nAlso, the professor or whoever talking to you over the intercom talks way too much, and it's sort of painful to listen to how much he tries to be funny but just isn't really. (Sorry, writers.) And his constant blabbering sort of ruins the atmosphere. For a dramatic improvement to atmosphere and experience, do yourself a favor. OPTIONS -> AUDIO SETTINGS -> DIALOGUE VOLUME -> turn it all the way down to zero to shut him up forever.\n\nAt the end of the day, it's a really great puzzle game that could have been a real classic, but its annoying habit of ruining its puzzles with physics that are beyond your control, first-person platforming too demanding for a puzzle game (FPS platforming is rarely a good idea as it is), and requiring a series of actions to be executed in a specific sequence with incredibly specific timing----it all just increasingly ruins the puzzles as each new chamber ratchets up the demands on the player in these areas. It wouldn't be so irritating if you didn't have to go fetch and reposition a bunch of blocks into catapults and conveyors and springs etc every time you failed one of the requirements (i.e. failed timing, or failed a jump, or else the physics just f***ed you over), but when you get into the later puzzle chambers, you're going to waste a lot of minutes of your life just "reloading" the puzzle chamber setup over and over again. As I said before, this all gets very f***ing tedious.\n\nIt's a shame, because this is a really well-made game and there is a lot here to like. I just really wish they wouldn't have pushed so hard on the physics/timing/platforming demands for a game that sells itself on puzzling. In my opinion, they took those aspects overboard and thereby undermined the enjoyment of the puzzling.","April 12, 2015","false","8.4"," 54 of 79 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","54","79","3","0"

Despite this increase of difficulty (reliance of speed, timing, and LOTS of patience are needed), the game is hilarious and  beautiful with a semi-cell-shaded, cartoon feel.

Often I was doing a puzzle over 10 times and failing every time because I didn't quite make the jump or I wasn't quite standing in the right place.  I knew what to do.  I had solved the puzzle part.  But I couldn't pull of the platforming aspect.  If you like platformers and puzzles but really go for the platforming aspect than this really is a good game.

It had a charming art style and relaxing music. As the game was from the designer of Portal, I assumed the it would be just as solid and dependable. Sadly, I was disappointed by inconsistent physics and weird behaviour such as any spring jump's momentum being instantly cancelled by pushing a direction on the stick (WSAD). This totally arbitrary restriction meant that getting a handle of that aspect of the game play was highly frustrating. I see no reason physics or otherwise for it to occur. It made the game incredibly irritating and it never recovered from it. With this knowledge, perhaps you will enjoy the game as I didn't. However, with inconsistent platforming mechanics and frequently irritating level design which unduly punishes platforming slip-ups, I'd have to say, play Portal again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xetrinttc/recommended/200010/","xetrinttc","Heropon Riki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xetrinttc/","110 products in account","Quantum Conundrum is an interesting game. It was developed Kim Swift, who was the lead designer of Portal, and it shows. The game takes the interesting idea of switching between four dimensions to solve puzzles. The first dimension is the Fluffy dimension, which makes heavy objects like safes and couches so light that you can pick them up and throw them. The second dimension is the Heavy dimension, which makes cardboard boxes weigh like a ton of lead. The third dimension is the Slow dimension, which slows down everything but the player. The final dimension is the Reverse Gravity dimension, which reverses the gravity of all interactable objects. Throughout the game, the player switches between these four dimensions to travel from room to room. Some rooms only allow one dimension, while other may allow all four, so it does change it up every so often.\n\nThe story isn't much to look into. The protagonist, a young chap, goes to visit his uncle, Professor Fitz Quadrangle, in his mansion. When he arrives, the Professor gets sent to a pocket dimension because the project he was working on went ary; however, he is able to talk to the player as he travels through the mansion. The mansion, because of the Professor's failed expirament, is on lock-down, and the player needs to travel to three generators and turn them on. The ending is rather unsatisfying, so don't go to this game for the story.\n\nThe graphics looks nice and clean. There's not much detail within the rooms, much like Portal, but it is still pleasing to the eye. The one problem I have with the graphics is the default setting for bloom effects. Whenever in the Fluffy dimension, the bloom can be really bright and hurts the eyes. I had it turned off for the entire game, and there were still times when it was super bright.\n\nThe tracks that play in the background, while not abundant, are pretty good. They don't get stuck in your head, but it's still nice to listen to while racking your brain on a puzzle. The voice acting in this game is wonderful. The Professor is played by John de Lancie, the actor behind Q from Star Trek. His voice fits the role really well. The dialogue, for the most part, is entertaining and chuckle-worthy, though there are times when he gets annoying, mainly when he repeats dialogue after you failed an attempt.\n\nWhile Quantum Conundrum isn't perfect, it does a fine job in delivering an interesting puzzle platformer.

Everything from the fluffy-iness of the fluffy dimension to the roughness of the heavy dimension is rendered beautifully. The Uncle's mansion is such an incredibly unique style. Even the only NPC you ever actually interact with looks like something straight out of a Disney or Pixar film. Gameplay is obviously inspired by Portal, but it takes the concept from that game and changes it into something completely different and incredibly similar at the same time. Three dimensions, light and soft; normal; heavy and hard, govern the elements of the puzzles you'll find in your Uncle's mansion. Along with the intriguing gameplay, are tons of hidden collectables. This makes the game a treasure trove for completionists.\n\nOn the other hand, this Quantum Conundrum is plagued by a badly voiced Uncle and a story that leaves much to be desired. The Uncle drones on while you play through each level. Either giving you hints to certain puzzles or just fumbling around seemingly holding you back by mistakes or errors comitted on his part. The voice acting is sadly bland. To be frank, there was a lack of anything. The Uncle sounded as though a preset voice created by a computer. Perhaps, that was what the game's story was implying, but I can never be to sure because there was almost a complete lack of a story. The underlying goal of the game was for me to finally meet up with my uncle, but other than that there wasn't much of a plot. The ending is equally as frustrating. Nothing is even remote resolved or answered. The ending implied a continuation of the game in a sequel, but after two years I haven't heard of anything.\n\nInstead of implementing a half-baked story with an Uncle and his estranged nephew, I would've much rather have the game just focused on the puzzles. Trying to recreate the Portal experience of having a robot entity taunt you throughout the game just wasn't a good idea and detracted from what was otherwise a wonderful game.\n\nI give this game a 7/10. The puzzles are definitely worth the price tag of $9, just don't expect a story-telling masterpiece.\n\nPros:\nUnique Artstyle\nInteresting Gameplay\nAddicting Collectables\n\nCons:\nPoor Story\nVoice Acting Leaves Much To Be Desired","October 28, 2014","true","7.2"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","2"

The only complant about graphics/how it plays is that instead of using loading screens, Quantum Conundrum uses long hallways, so you get some REALLY bad frame drop inbetween levels, and some hallways are just WAY too long. I would give the graphics and how it plays a 5/5\n\n- Level Disign: The levels are very well created and have a mix between science lab and mansion/victorian feel. Sometimes though it is hard to tell what the objective in a level is, I would have liked like a big red "Exit" sign at the exit door so I could see it. I would rate the level disign a 4/5.\n\n- Music and Audio: All I can say is the music in this game is just astounding, even though this game does not look to be that popular, so much work has gone into the music I HIGHLY recomend buying the Soundtrack while buying the game. Some sound effects are a bit obnoxios, but most sound fine and work well with the feel of the game. I would give the sounds and music a 5/5.\n\n- Controls and Menu: The menu is sometimes confusing but may I just say THERE IS NO EXIT BUTTON ON THE MAIN MENU, you have to go into "Start Game" to exit the game I mean how counter intuative can you get. Also the mouse sensativity settings in the menu had like 3 different levels, not just a slider and I would have liked to see more than 1 audio slider. The controls where great out of the box, everything you would expect, exept jump. Jump was space BUT unlike in some games when you jumped, if you weren't EXACTLY on the ground you woulden't jump and in some situations in the game, that ment life or death. I would give the controls and menu a 2/5.\n\nOverall this game is a great game with a very easy story to follow and challenging levels. I would DEFFENENTLY recommend buying the DLCs because the game is about a 4 hour playthrough so if you are still thursty for some demention switching I would recommend the DLCs.\n\nI would give this game a overall rating of 4/5 and would DEFFENENTALY recommend it.","December 26, 2014","true","6.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","6","7","0","0"

The game has a professor character that tries to spice up the puzzles with commentary, but they're just not that interesting a character.\nEstranged-Uncle-Genius-That-Loves-Grandchild-But-Treats-Them-Like-Dirt has surprisingly been done before several times, and this one doen't really stand out from the crowd.\n\nThe puzzles are fine - they fluctuate between boring and interesting, but, honestly, it just feels like there are too many of them (or at least too many that feel the same).\n\nFurther in, the game has an odd paradigm shift where it focuses more on accurate platforming than solving a particular problem. The main gripe I have here is that the jump doesn't allow for much mid-air adjustment. So, once you jump, you  better hope you did it right or you're going to fall.\nAlso, there's a weird physics quirk where, if you're moving through the air and collide with anything you just stop dead and fall straight down - which feels off if I'm in a dimension where everything weighs next to nothing and should just bounce off me.\n\nI don't think the Portal comparison is unfair, either. The reason why Portal just feels better as a physics puzzler even though this game has similar puzzles is that in Portal, if you need to make an adjustment, its instant. Just aim and make a new portal.\nIn this game, the dimensions mechanic is all about the spawned in items the game gives you to solve the puzzles. Meaning, if you mess up, you have to go back to the spawn tube to fetch the items and start over. Respawning the items resets all of them, so even if some are already in a spot you want them, if you drop one down a hole or get a bad bounce into a laser, you have to start all over.\nWhich just makes a tedious game feel like it drags on more than it already does.\n\nOkay game. Get it if you really like physics puzzlers, otherwise skip it.","February 5","false","1.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","13","21","0","0"

The graphics are cool, nice and cartoony, great design, the concept of the gameplay is nice, and the jokes are hilarious.\n\nHowever, as everything in this world, it's not perfect.\n\nThis game requires more skill than brain power. If your here for a good puzzle, hoping it will frizzle (yes, frizzle) your brain, you will be dissapointed. There are too many moments in the game where you stand and think, like "how the hell can I do this", and the your uncle just says "like this". He just points out what you were trying to get, and it makes you feel - stupid. Instead of the legendary "Ah ha!" moment that's all over Portal and was in the core design of Portal, there's your uncle, looking A LOT smarter than you, pointing the whole point (bum ta tzz) out. Sometimes, you just want to scream SHUT UP at him.\n\nI guess I put you off, didn't I? Not to worry, you'll be on in a moment.\n\nHowever, this game is far from a bad game. The graphics are very original, with a smush of cartoon here and there. The props are designed very well. It gives the whole house a friendly, homely feel. You can see that the game was designed for kids however, but I liked it.\n\nThe colour palette is well handled, and the graphics change depending in which dimension you are in. It's fun looking at how the things look like in different dimensions. For example, a cube (which is actually a safe), looks like a safe in the normal dimension, in the heavy dimension it looks like a super heavy duty super heavy metal crate. It would look good on a heavy metal concert. In the light, or fluffy in the game lingo, dimension, the safe looks like a woolen toy say for kids from your grandma. The two other dimensions only add image effects to the game, so I want be talking (*writing) about those, and I don't want to be a spoiler.\n\nThe puzzles, as I said, are not very hard (usually), and require more skill, but the maps are perfectly designed and contain quite fun elements, and you will fly on safes quite a lot.\n\nYour uncle, who is ~not~ pleased to have you there, has quite baddass humor (I'll never forget the "Everyday I'm shovellin'" joke), but he starts liking you more throughout the game. He talks a lot - read: all the time - but thankfully you can put your  headphones off and turn on the captions when you're fed up.\n\nThe music is nice, was humming it for a week after, and I got the soundtrack too (which I don't know what idiot set to Windows only). It's profesionally done, and it's not out of the place, it belongs to the game.\n\n\nSo that's that. If your thinking the game is for kids, just return to those kid days (not for real damnit, only in your mind), and get this game as soon as possible. Worth every penny, although I bought it with €uros which have cents.\n\nAnd when someone calls you a kid for playing this, just say "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?" (I'm sorry, had to put that somewhere)\n\nGo and enjoy every moment of this great puzzle platformer game.\n\n\nI want a fluffy Ike.","August 4, 2014","true","8.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I'm not even sure why because I was really excited to play it. So I pre-ordered it back then, and when it was finally available I played it for 2 hours and then... stopped.

Switching between them while solving these puzzles can actually be very rewarding. It's a great feeling.

(That's the actor who played Q on ST:TNG, if you're a fan of the show.)  The game suits him well, charming with a unique brand of wit and humour sprinkled throughout each puzzle.  It's a delight to play and, while many of the solutions are somewhat rigid, more than a few allow the player enough freedom to come up with their own answers to each obstacle.\n\nUnfortunately, since Mr. de Lancie's commentary, as the professor, greatly establishes the mood and tempo of the game, I cannot recommend the DLC.  Ike-Aramba! and The Desmond Debacle fall flat due to their monotony and most of the puzzles in them are less puzzles and more sequences of specific timing where the slightest error--in a belligerently linear solution--will have you pulling out your hair as you try and try again.  At least the checkpoints are frequent enough that you never have to start a puzzle from the very beginning.\n\nThe short version:  Buy the game--it's really fun, and spring for the DLC if it's on sale.

And while it does share a few similarities with Portal (1st person puzzle solving, an omnipresent narrator), QC is a distinctly unique experience. Instead of Portals, the tools at your disposal are 4 "dimensions" (fluffy, heavy, slow-mo and reverse-grav), which you can swap between at will. Just like in Portal, each dimension, and the various techniques needed to solve puzzles using them, are introduced gradually. Each of the 3 main levels start out easy, but end up requiring ever-more mind-bending uses of the various dimension shifts to solve. I never found the game to be particularly hard, but you will definitely have to think hard about some of the solutions. All in all, it's very satisfying as a puzzle game.

Unlike Portal though it relies HEAVILY on first person platforming. About halfway through the game it shifts from being ridiculously easy to frustratingly difficult. Not the good kind of difficult either. Several puzzles I knew exactly what the game wanted me to do, but couldn't physically do it. Platform jumping in first person just doesn't work. Also the game gives and takes away the four powers you have constantly so it's hard to remember in the heat of the moment which button does what. It doesn't test your puzzle solving skills as much as your mastery of awkard controls and awful platforming. I really wanted to finish this game but it got to the point where it wasn't fun. I googled the stage I was on to see how many stages were left. Sixteen. Not worth it.

The game is fantastic, straight away you have to solve fun puzzles which will work your brain quite a bit and then get across rooms with a bit of platforming. However, the lack of multiplayer and the lag spikes in between levels can be quite troublesome.\n\nOf course, while these faults bring down the game's overall score, I still recommend you buy this game with a reduced price.

Probably 3rd person perspective would work better.\n\nIf you try to limit the number of dimension shifts, you need smarts and sometimes patience, so it's good, but I sadly don't see myself getting the time constraints achievement.\n\nAlso, seems like if you want real closure, you'll have to buy the upcoming DLCs.

While I was at first drawn in by its Portal-esque humor and gameplay, this game can become quite infuriating It relies heavily on physics puzzles and first-person platforming. The former is difficult to do well, and Quantum Conundrum makes a valiant effort, but certain puzzles are simply broken and rely much on repeated tries before the game deems you worthy to work properly. First-person platforming, however, is impossible to do well. QC is no exception; oftentimes you will know exactly how to finish a puzzle but keep falling off the platform you're on. That's not difficulty - that's just infuriating. All in all, if you like Portal and etc., you may indeed like Quantum Conundrum.

As everyone by now knows, Kim Swift was one of the key contributors to Portal and it's spiritual predecessor, Narbacular Drop. And you can't help wonder if Narbacular Drop would have turned out a little more like Quantum Conundrum if Valve hadn't turned it into Portal.\nBut her time at Valve has certainly rubbed off. You have a first person perspective, the classic Valve learning curve, a silent protagonist, a guiding voice, Team Fortress-style graphics, and no annoying cutscenes whatsoever.\nAlthough it never reaches Valve's high quality-bar, QC is funny, charming, inventive and has just enough variety of puzzles to keep you going. It suffers from being just a little too easy (and I don't think I'm being immodest!), and from a very basic plot which only offers any true feeling of peril in it's closing minutes.\nWhat QC does well is to remind you that fun and originality don't have to be confined to indie titles.

It's unfortunate that Quantum is compared to Portal because it by no means compares favorably.  There are some good elements, for sure, and there's some good humor, but it's mostly just a dull grind.  There are only a few really tricky puzzle elements, and even then they're reused so many times that the meaning is lost.  There are just too many puzzle rooms for the amount of actual puzzle in the game, unfortunately, but even then Quantum was just a short game.\n\nSo it was stretched out and still too short.  Interesting eh?\n\nAnother major issue I had was that the different quantum states were handed out so infrequently.  You just don't get enough time with the later ones, and you use the early ones for far too long.  Bad pacing, that.\n\nHell, a lot of the puzzles don't have you use all four anyway.  Beyond that, a bunch are just straight up locked half the time, or you'll unlock them after having completed a small part of the puzzle.  I just didn't care for the level design.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, you should definitely play this game if only to get a better idea of puzzle and level design.  Play Portal, then play this.  If nothing else, Quantum Conundrum serves as a good teaching device for how not to go about puzzle/level design and pacing.\n\nOh, and percision platforming from first person view sucks ♥♥♥♥.  Those parts of the game sucked, and they're a lot of them.  The physics engine is unreliable at best, so sometimes you just repeat the same thing a bunch of times hoping that, this time, everything acts in the way you need it to in order to finish.  I'm not kidding.\n\nFinal note?  I did quite enjoy the comedy of the game.  Good stuff.

Aside from the dimensions, puzzles are mostly button pressing and platforming based. A few points are rather buggy or difficult, but otherwise a fun game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/best_jeppe/recommended/200010/","best_jeppe","[SWE]best_jeppe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/best_jeppe/","204 products in account","So this is a first person puzzle game much in the same vein as Portal. One of the creators of Portal is also behind this game so there are some similarities. But where Portal was ingenious and funny, Quantum Conundrum is not. The main difference as I see it between the games is that in Portal working out the solution to the puzzle can be a bit hard but once you do the execution of said solution is fairly easy. In Quantum Conundrum it is the exact opposite. The solutions are easy to figure out but the executions can be complex and frustrating. Needless to say, I prefer the Portal-way of doing puzzles.\n\nIn Quantum Conundrum you often have to time several jumps on the row which can make it frustrating when you  miss the last jump and have to start over again. On the upside, the checkpoint-system is very generous so you dont have to redo a puzzle from the beginning but you usually continue at exactley the platform-puzzle where you failed.\n\nI found the game easy and it took me about 3 - 4 hours to complete it. The problem is that it seems that they have opted for Quantity instead of Quality when it comes to the puzzle. If you play the game for an extended period of time (over 30 minutes) you get a bit bored by the fact that every puzzle bare some resembles to the one before it which makes it feel that you are essentially solving variations of the same puzzle multiple times. It works to play it in short spurts but over 30 minutes of gametime isn't recommended.\n\nAt this point it costs about €9 and I would recommend it when it drops down to $5 and if you have a real craving for a first person puzzle-game.

QC has a rather funny and cartoon-y art style, which definitely fits the overall theme of the game.\n\nOn the downside, the level design is kinda repetitive and the devs seemed to use the copypaste function more than they should.\n\nUnfortunately, the game doesn't seem to offer that much replay value, so unless you're a completionist, you're probably done in about 6-7 hours. For a fun and polished game like QC, that's still a pretty good deal, though. And with the DLCs already being announced, there's enough reason to boot up the game again and try the new puzzles.\n\nSo, if you're into first person puzzling, make sure to check QC out!","July 27, 2012","true","6.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't listen to what the critics say : Listen to the gamers! Quantum Conundrum is at least as good as P1 and P2. It is different; you don't work with portals, but with dimensions. 4 different dimensions to be precise. The game has a playtime of  6 - 8 hours. The puzzles are not THAT hard, but you'll find yourself taking more time to figure them out, than you initially thought you would. I also like the humor very very much. As I said, it's different from Portal but it's funny nonetheless. If you found P1 and/or P2 at least interesting then you HAVE to buy Quantum Conundrum. BEWARE THOUGH : Do NOT pay a cent for the DLC.

The ones that anyone can actually enjoy, at any age, with or without kids of their own. And then there's "kid's movies", the ones that only young kids can really sit through and enjoy. Sadly, this is the kind of game that falls into that later category. The humor is obvious, boring, and at times it feels ripped straight from the internet. It's aesthetic is the kind that you can tell is trying really hard to be cute, but I certainly don't think it really succeeded. Cartoony, sure, but hardly cute. The puzzles are eazy to figure out, but often frustating and stressful to actually carry out.\n\nThis is all really sad, because the mechanics themselves are ridiculously good. With some slight tweaking, a bit more testing, and some slight redesigning, and maybe someone taking a new approach to the script, this could have been a really fun, compelling game. But you're just much better off looking for some other puzzle game, one that won't frustrate you with annoying acrobatics, some wonky game design, and the occasional cringe inducing one liner (there's only one character, ALL the dialogue is one liners).\n\nMaybe, just maybe, if it's on a really good sale, pick it up. Kid's will love it, I'm sure. If it's just for you, though, I can't say I'd recommend spending more than $3 on this.

Unfortunately it falls a bit short of the expectations it set. It just feels like the developers were to concentrated on making a game like portal but different and as a result it comes across as forced. Go look at the descriptions for Portal 1 & 2, nowhere does it talk about how funny the game is. As a result it catches you off guard and is quite hilarious at times. On the other hand you have QC which makes sure you know their trying to be funny which takes away the edge, the surprise. I eventually just turned the volume for the voices down. I feel part of the problem is it seems the dev fell into the trap of having a child main character causing the tone, and subsequently the humor, to tend towards childish. Everything about the game just feels like it was made for 8-10 year olds. All that being said it is still probably worth a play. The mechanics do make for some interesting puzzles and it is different enough from other games to be of value. Just don't expect it to be comparable to the gems that are Portal 1 & 2.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rza3XXAzf2s","January 6, 2014","false","13.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

When you're playing through the game's story mode, it's fairly good.\n\nYou can see that there are plently of elements common to the genre, which you might be tempted to use to draw parallels to "portal". There's the crazy mad scientist with puzzle rooms you need to solve in order to progress. But that is where the similarities end. As far as the story goes, while John de Lancie does a good job in voicing the mad scientist [uncle quadwrangle], he provides some humorous quotes. But that's it, just some disconnected quotes.\n\nYou're shoved into the house, and something has gone wrong. OK, fine, I can run with this. Your uncle is a scientist who invents crazy contraptions. The thing is, it is never explained why there are these vast "puzzle rooms", and aside from the dimension hopping you never interact with any other inventions aside from the bots and seeing them in paintings. All this and the story ends rather abruptly with you savingyour uncle but now you're trapped instead, ok that's the end, bye.. Plus, the DLC doesn't really add anything to the story, other than some extra puzzles without any voiceover.\n\nAs far as the gameplay goes, playign through the game once, and everything is pretty fun. You get to experiment with physics in different dimensions and try to reach the exits. But when you replay it to try and beat the challenges [speed runs, finding collectibles, using fewest shifts], you realise that the physics engine isn't really very good. Frequently the "dollis" will spit out cubes in such an inconsistent way that it becomes very hard to speedrun. You'll find that cubes landing on bots sometimes randomly move about, which can screw up a run. It's less of a physics engine and more a sort of functionally-scripted environment. It can get very annoying at times trying to deal with it.\n\nThe music is quite good though, and the game controls well with a controller, which is saying somethign considering it's a first person game. The graphics are really nice, with a sort of cartoonish feel which matches quite well with the portrayal of the mad scientist and his funny quotes.\n\nOverall though, I would not reccomend this game. The physics annoyances is really what kills it. I could live with a mediocre story, but when you consider that the physics makes up a large part of the game it's not really acceptable that it should fail like that.","January 5","false","19.6"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

Not only do you NOT get to see the professor (outside of pictures throughout the house that is), when you get to the end - and start to free him, the game abruptly ENDS! Thats right - the game stops, a cartoon cut scene explaining that you and him ended up swaping places. Then the credits roll. FAIL\n\nOK, that said. this game is FKN AMAZING! First off, do not play it right after you finish the PORTAL series. You'll be greatly disappointed, as you will spend a lot of your time comparing the two.  PORTAL is more of LOGIC based puzzles and QC is more PHYSICS based.\n\nYou have four dimension, you are introduced to one at a time, and are in control of throughout the game. Each one is used to help solve each room you traverse through, as yo make your way down to save your uncle (who, at the beginning got stuck in a different dimension)\n\nFLUFFY: makes things light, allowing you to pick up just about any item not nailed down\n\nSLOW: More like slo-motion on crack! Its REALLY slow. helps slow things down\n\nHEAVY: makes things extreamly heavy - mostly used to solve puzzles that need excessive weight - like switches(these require weirght that the safes cannot produce)\n\nREVERSE GRAVITY: reverses gravity - here you really learn about physics..\n\nMusic is very nice. and does a good job as background music, as it does not distract your attention. John De Lance was amazing as the voice of the profesor which his cutting sarcasm that makes think throughout the game - what is his real motive.\n\nOne nice thing I thought was great, is the Proessor would alway give crptic clues on how to solve the room. But the first play through I did (of many) I just took them at face value and mindless patter. silly me\n\nLike PORTAL, every where you go makes sense, and the "puzzle" feel is NOT there, so you more or less feel like you are traveling to get your uncle, and these rooms are just in your way.\n\n\n\nEven with the horrid ending, I would still highly recommend this game just for the sheer puzzles alone.","May 4, 2014","true","55.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You are the grandson or uncle, can't remember, of a scientist who has trapped himself in some dimension.

It's fun at first but I was bored with the game a littel after starting the first generator. A lot of it felt like the same old thing just different room.

The concept is quite original and does require heavy thinking, especially when the game throws you a puzzle that requires all 4 dimensions to complete the puzzle.\n\nJohn de Lancie is great in this game too, he voices your uncle who is a scientist who makes wonderful gadgets and gismos, especially the glove you wear all the way through your journey. (not really a spoiler since it's told in the trailers and start of the game)\n\nThe music isn't half bad either! Worth picking up in my opinion.\n\nHowever, nothing is perfect... let's get to the downsides, and this is a spoiler on the ending... in a spoiler free way though, I'll just say the ending sucks.\nAll you get is a 30 second clip telling you that your character has been sent to a pocket dimension that your uncle was trapped in this entire time, while your uncle then gets out and tries to fix a problem that he helped you cause because he lost his memory and this problem is going to effect the entire planet. Then it rolls the credits.\n\nYou may think that sounds awesome but it's explained in 30 seconds, and if you think that's enough for an awesome cutscene explaining that, you're wrong since the cutscenes in this game are set up exactly like the main menus, so you just see a drawing of the house fall into the ocean in an innocent cartoon-y fashion and then it shows the whole planet change colour repeatedly. That's it. No awesome looking climax like in Portal and Half-Life 2.\n\nIt's a real shame this game had no better cutscene since the game was building the ending to be a nice sparkly bow to a great game, but it didn't which is a real shame since the game is worth it at full price but the ending made me feel like I wasted my time and that everything I did in the game was really for nothing. If the game was designed to be a series of tests that didn't have a narrative or story, then I wouldn't mind it but because it was building up this story, the ending felt very lazy and tacked on to make you interested into buying a sequel that we may never get (and unlikely will get).\n\nTo wrap it up: The game is worth the full price, but the ending didn't make the game feel worth the journey (even though it is worth playing) and doesn't make me feel interested in buying the DLC. Oh, and the collectible items are really well hidden.","May 17, 2015","true","11.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The concept is there. But...\n\nSweet f*cking Jesus, this game is fun at first, but then it shows it's true nature: desperately trying to make the janky physics work over, and over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over and over and over and over again! Especially with the power cores: if you want your game to have mechanics based on physics, which require you to get the core from point A to point B by manipulating said physics, why in the F*CK is the godd*mn core shaped like a 12-sided dice?! Especially when the corners keep scraping single pixels and making you start over again!\n\nAnd the DLC's are even worse! In Desmond's Debacle, the developers thought it was a good idea to add invisible walls for the cores to keep go in the right direction. The problem is that the because of those walls, the cores keep randomly switching direction and COMPLETELY messing up everything you do!\n\nAnd the more you play the game, the more you see the unpolished mechanics. Exactly why do I lose ALL of my momentum when I step off from any object you can ride (as in stand on)? Example: you're riding a safe to get to a platform on a wall above a pit. The safe is flying at the speed of around 30km/h. As the platform is coming up, you jump off the safe to land on the platform. Too f*cking bad, you have now lost all of the momentum, as if you were just spawned there and you'll fall in to the pit to your death. Why? Because f*ck actual physics and f*ck you!\n\nI'm sorry, but this game is much, MUCH more frustrating than it is fun.

John De Lancie phones this one in, but he can't take all the blame as the writing is as witless and dry as he portrays it to be.\n\nI've actualy encountered game halting bugs while playing, where the game fails to keep track of objects being destroyed through the various dimensional shifts causing me to have to reload certain sections of the game in order to retry them.\n\nI can't even recommend this game for kids as death is a constant factor in the game, which is handled poorly with one-liner throw-aways telling you of how bland and stale life is.  Add to the fact that some zones that appear to be safe are infact instant death only makes this situation worse.  In one area you can walk on metal plating and in another area it will kill you without rhyme nor reason.\n\nIf there was one word to describe this game, it would be "Bland."  What made this game so annoying was that I was actually trying to enjoy it, but at almost every turn the crappy gameplay would just get in the way and punish me with death for a mis-step or force me to start an entire room over for a single mis-click.\n\nI will attest to being a masocist for challenging games, but there was no hint of a reward that would make me want to pursue playing this game further.  I can easily forgive bad gameplay if there was good writing, music or art to back it up  But this game has none of those things going for it.\n\nOne afterword:  This game was designed for consoles in mind and it shows.  If that bothers you, well that's even more of a reason NOT to play it.","March 1, 2013","false","2.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

For example, your character appears to have no momentum of his own, so if you jump while standing on an object, you suddenly stop in mid-air and fall. It's somewhat disappointing and makes the puzzles more frustrating than necessary to solve.","July 28, 2012","false","4.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's repetitive and, even worse, due to the physics, solving puzzles often comes down to luck, not puzzle solving or skill.

Now let's forget about that and try to look at it on its own merits. It's a perfectly competent first person puzzle-em-up, really. The graphics are nice, you have a competent narrator, and most of the puzzles are just about the right difficulty. If you just want some physics puzzles you can really stop reading now, it's worth buying.\n\nThe problem is that it isn't interesting. The narrator doesn't add anything to the game and the story isn't interesting; you're exploring a mansion to save your trapped uncle, there's no real mystery here (except a small, uninteresting "twist" and the end). I personally find this aspect very important in puzzle games, weird as it may seem; Portal (oops, I said it again!) had an interesting story, Infinifactory has an interesting story, Magrunner has an interesting story, and this *really* helps make the puzzles more interesting; you're not just solving puzzles for the sake of it, you have an overarching story and reason to actually persist.\n\nQuantum Conundrum does not. There's no attraction here other than the puzzles themselves - which is fine, really, but it drags the game down. It's still worth buying if you want a game where you enter puzzle rooms, listen to the narrator, and then solve the puzzle. Just don't expect it to be funny or engaging.\n\nedit: Even if you find De Lancie amusing (I don't, but eh, tastes differ) he isn't in the DLC; they're purely puzzles. This means they're even less interesting, but the general statement of quality still applies.","February 8, 2015","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the puzzles make you use the same parts of your brain that you do when playing Portal. It also caused me to feel the same type of brain melting numbness I got when I played Portal. But don't let this turn you off it and think it's a Portal clone. Far from it my friend. Sure you have a quirky overlord (in this  case your uncle) giving you helpful, and not so helpful comments along your puzzle building road, along with, as I said before, the puzzles feeling similar, but thats where it ends. My main love for this game goes to the incredible voice actor, John DeLancie, who perfectly portrays your uncle who's not at all keen to have you in the house putting back together the pieces while he's stuck in this empty non-existential dimension that contains blackness (according to him anywway). It may have been because I'm older but I liked the puzzles in this game. It had that good balance of difficulty but not too much that it makes you rage quit (although I did once or twice have to look up on YouTube for a solution - some of the puzzles are hard!)

Quick reflexes aren't necessarily required for the platforming, they're mainly needed for switching between dimensions. The majority of the complicated platforming parts actually happen in the slow motion dimension.\n\nUnfortunately, as with most other games in the genre, this one is pretty short. I completed it in under 5 hours despite failing repeatedly on a few of the puzzles, in addition to taking my time to absorb the somewhat-skippable story.

I love physics based sandbox stuff, and the wacky presentation also appealed to me. However, a physics based game needs to have good physics to begin with, which Quantum Conundrum certainly doesn't - player occassionally gets stuck on flat surfaces, objects behave weirdly, etc. Then, you need tight controls if the puzzles are not only cerebral but require some skill - failed again.\nI liked the basic idea with the four special dimensions, the visuals are nice, and the narration is mostly funny. However, even if the puzzle design was perfect, the issues with the controls and the physics would make the game very difficult (or impossible) to enjoy. And, unfortunately, 30-40% of the puzzles are just repetitive drivel - while the rest contain a few touches of genius. After three hours of playing, I can't recommend this game - I may go forward with it for a while, but I wouldn't buy it again.

Maybe that was a result of the fun quickly turning to boredom, or the lack of any semblence of a story, or something else I'm not picking up on, the result is the same: Tedium.\n\nIf you can grab this game for under $5 during a sale, I'd recommend it purely for John De Lancie's (Q from Star Trek TNG) voice acting and some of the cute puzzles, but there's not enough variety here to make you feel like you've accomplished something every time you clear a room. Instead of saying "Oh THAT was cool!" you're more likely to say "Well thank christ that's over". Some of the later puzzles are also not very well thought out and require bending of the game's rules to complete. Instead of providing a solution within the parameters of the game, I had to avoid those parameters, or bend them, to get through the last leg of the game.\n\nAnd to think, Kim Swift quit her job at Valve to work on THIS.

The dialogue and story were interesting and humorous. There were some cool puzzles, and a few of them were fairly complex to understand or coordinate.\n\nThis game has heavy platforming and quick-reflex challenges, which make up most of the difficulty in many of the stages (rather than complex puzzle solving). Quick reflexes aren't necessarily required for the platforming, they're mainly needed for switching between dimensions. The majority of the complicated platforming parts actually happen in the slow motion dimension.\n\nUnfortunately, as with most other games in the genre, this one is pretty short. I completed it in under 5 hours despite failing repeatedly on a few of the puzzles, in addition to taking my time to absorb the somewhat-skippable story.

Even the puzzles make you use the same parts of your brain that you do when playing Portal. It also caused me to feel the same type of brain melting numbness I got when I played Portal. But don't let this turn you off it and think it's a Portal clone. Far from it my friend. Sure you have a quirky overlord (in this  case your uncle) giving you helpful, and not so helpful comments along your puzzle building road, along with, as I said before, the puzzles feeling similar, but thats where it ends. My main love for this game goes to the incredible voice actor, John DeLancie, who perfectly portrays your uncle who's not at all keen to have you in the house putting back together the pieces while he's stuck in this empty non-existential dimension that contains blackness (according to him anywway). It may have been because I'm older but I liked the puzzles in this game. It had that good balance of difficulty but not too much that it makes you rage quit (although I did once or twice have to look up on YouTube for a solution - some of the puzzles are hard!) With that said, I do recommend this game.

Worth the 5$ I spent? Absolutely. Worth more? Maybe. You decide.\n\nThe one issue it really faced was the lack of puzzle variety. Launch this here. Jump there. But now do it with lighter objects! And then with objects that fall up! If there were more dimensions that really felt different, interacted more often, and allowed more freedom of puzzling, the game would have hit me much harder.\n\nOther issues being that there's little room to just futz with the dimensions, and that there aren't really enough of them. Sure they could've limited you to 4 at a time still, but they could've put in more than 4. As is, heavy and light honestly felt like two sides to the same coin, so it was really just 3 dimensions.\n\nOn top of that, if the dimensions weren't prescribed to levels, or if the developers didn't try to shoot down any varying solutions to the problems (either by making dimensions unavailable or by silly placements of walls) then the game would have felt more like a puzzle game instead of an execution game. I don't mean a game kills you, but you usually instantly know what you need to do with what you have, and you just have to do it to beat the level. It was like how Portal 2 felt after playing Portal 1. The game was enjoyable, but the exploration was gone. All the white walls were replaced by shiny paneled walls with a white panels obviously sticking out in one area.\n\nAnd to add to the Portal analogy, the story didn't carry me through as strongly as the Portal 2 story did. And the game's aesthetic wasn't as pretty either. Not to bash on a small company, but the same idea has been done better by other people for cheaper cost to the consumer.\n\nThe Uncle was a fun character, but the puns can get sigh worthy, the "surprise" in the story is foreseen by the end of the first chapter, and basically the game's feel relied more on quick chuckles than anything else.\n\nI think to sum it up, this game felt like it was made for 8 year olds. Fantastic for them, but sadly not advertised to them.

Even the puzzles make you use the same parts of your brain that you do when playing Portal. It also caused me to feel the same type of brain melting numbness I got when I played Portal. But don't let this turn you off it and think it's a Portal clone. Far from it my friend. Sure you have a quirky overlord (in this  case your uncle) giving you helpful, and not so helpful comments along your puzzle building road, along with, as I said before, the puzzles feeling similar, but thats where it ends. My main love for this game goes to the incredible voice actor, John DeLancie, who perfectly portrays your uncle who's not at all keen to have you in the house putting back together the pieces while he's stuck in this empty non-existential dimension that contains blackness (according to him anywway). It may have been because I'm older but I liked the puzzles in this game. It had that good balance of difficulty but not too much that it makes you rage quit (although I did once or twice have to look up on YouTube for a solution - some of the puzzles are hard!) With that said, I do recommend this game. It helps wake up your brain and is a good little brain worker for those than enjoy puzzles (like I do)","September 13, 2014","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Worth the 5$ I spent? Absolutely. Worth more? Maybe. You decide.\n\nThe one issue it really faced was the lack of puzzle variety. Launch this here. Jump there. But now do it with lighter objects! And then with objects that fall up! If there were more dimensions that really felt different, interacted more often, and allowed more freedom of puzzling, the game would have hit me much harder.\n\nOther issues being that there's little room to just futz with the dimensions, and that there aren't really enough of them. Sure they could've limited you to 4 at a time still, but they could've put in more than 4. As is, heavy and light honestly felt like two sides to the same coin, so it was really just 3 dimensions.\n\nOn top of that, if the dimensions weren't prescribed to levels, or if the developers didn't try to shoot down any varying solutions to the problems (either by making dimensions unavailable or by silly placements of walls) then the game would have felt more like a puzzle game instead of an execution game. I don't mean a game kills you, but you usually instantly know what you need to do with what you have, and you just have to do it to beat the level. It was like how Portal 2 felt after playing Portal 1. The game was enjoyable, but the exploration was gone. All the white walls were replaced by shiny paneled walls with a white panels obviously sticking out in one area.\n\nAnd to add to the Portal analogy, the story didn't carry me through as strongly as the Portal 2 story did. And the game's aesthetic wasn't as pretty either. Not to bash on a small company, but the same idea has been done better by other people for cheaper cost to the consumer.\n\nThe Uncle was a fun character, but the puns can get sigh worthy, the "surprise" in the story is foreseen by the end of the first chapter, and basically the game's feel relied more on quick chuckles than anything else.\n\nI think to sum it up, this game felt like it was made for 8 year olds. Fantastic for them, but sadly not advertised to them. Worth a look if you want a casual puzzle experience and find it on sale, but don't expect too much out of it.","May 31, 2013","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.\n\nSome of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.\n\nThe story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.\n\nGood stuff.","January 21, 2013","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You don't have a portal gun but an IDS device, no that's not an Iain Duncan Smith device that makes your pensions and benefits disappear but an Inter-Dimensional Shift device to flip between dimensions that give items different properties. A great puzzle game, like Portal, makes you feel clever when you solve a problem but a bad one will frustrate you and make you feel like an idiot. This game does a pretty good job, it is not as satisfying as Portal but it is still good fun. Some of the puzzles require precise timing and can take a number of attempts but do not get too frustrating. John de Lancie does a great job voicing the professor that adds an interesting plot to ties the puzzles together. The game is a good length.

The gameplay consists of picking up and moving or throwing objects along with changing physics through 4 different dimensions. Along the way are various contraptions that are used in combination with each dimension and platforming elements. Most levels have simple puzzles and platforming, but there are some tricky ones to give a challenge now and then. The story is simple, but features Professor Quadwrangle, a strange and funny scientist voiced by John de Lancie, and his nephew. He provides humor and hints in the game along with some ancedotes and storytelling. The game is cartoony, with big open spaces and giant sized objects perfect for platforming.

Your left hand will be busy (combining and alternating dimensions) compared to Portal's right-hand activity (of making portals).  Timing is important, but split-second timing is not; planning is much more significant.  The sense of humor tends to mad-science whimsy; John De Lancie brings his Star-Trek "Q" personality to the player's uncle narrator.

And there is a level near the end where you have to stack 15 boxes to get to a higher ledge... some level designs are definitely questionable. You also can't quick save/save slot, there is an automatic checkpoint save but you can't even load that file, so when you leave the game you have to start from the very beginning of the chapter.\n\nOverall, most of the early puzzles are easy and I did find a few that were challenging, some level designs could of been improved, and the single player campaign takes around 5-6 hours. Quantum Conundrum season pass comes with additional DLC missions (reviews on the comments) and a soundtrack folder.  And for those who didn't know, this game was directed by Kim Swift (ex-Valve employee,  designer of Portal).\n\nThe base game has my recommendation.","December 25, 2012","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Instead of saying "Oh THAT was cool!" you're more likely to say "Well thank christ that's over". Some of the later puzzles are also not very well thought out and require bending of the game's rules to complete.

For example: you can make objects lighter to transport them/throw them, make them heavier to break through glass or indestructible.\n\nI recommend it simply for the puzzles and the satisfaction it gives to complete a section when you've discovered an entirely new mechanic a dimension proposes, just by yourself. Honestly, there's a lot more into play than in Portal 1 and almost as much as Portal 2, and if you liked those two games, there's a lot of content to entertain you for a while in this game.\n\nHowever, I believe this game has a major flaw: its ending. No spoilers will be given here, but honestly, there is a great, inmensely great build-up while progressing through the final stages of the game. I was genuinely curious as to what was going to happen in the very last puzzle, and started imagining what it could be; but... Nothing. A rather abrupt ending, virtually no final puzzle, and... in retrospect, the puzzles right before the ending weren't even that much of a challenge either. I would have expected their difficulty/completxity to be something much greater, but... meh. I was really disappointed.

The dimensions come from a glove you wear in the game, and are activated on-cue through keyboard bindings. The four dimensions are:\n\n1. "Fluffy" - Makes it so you can lift and throw what would normally be too heavy to handle items.\n2. "Heavy" - Makes items that would be considered "light" to instead have their mass increased (weigh more in non-scientific terms)\n3. "Slow" - Basically slow-mo.\n4. "Reverse Gravity" - As it says, items float to the ceiling when activated.\n\nThe main story revolves around you, portrayed as a young nephew, trying to find his Uncle who is in an unknown location and needs help rescuing. How is it in comparison to a game like Portal?\n\nQuantum is missing the "charm" that Portal (specifically 2) has. The characters are not as unique or likeable. For example, isntead of Wheatley and GLaDOs, you get a furry animal named Ike and your "crazy scientist" uncle. There are no companion cubes, instead they are replaced with cartoon-like safes. The setting is bland; a mansion. And while you go through the puzzles, your uncle keeps chiming in with one-liners you would hear from a high school math teacher.\n\nDon't get me wrong. It may sound like I hate Quantum-quite the opposite. It is a very solid game with good mechanics and physics-based puzzles. However, the magic of the game just is not there. Many of the puzzles rely on timing and reflexes rather than thought and careful design. The story is not a life-or-death scenario, but more of a child-friendly adventure.\n\nThis is a game that I would solidly recommend you pick up on sale, particularly in the 50-75% off range. If you enjoyed Portal 1+2, you will enjoy this, just not nearly as much.","July 1, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While this game may look like something that will make you think outside the box, it's actually the opposite. The game is quite linear for the most part, with not much flexibility given to the player. Most levels are designed to be solved in a specific way, but that is not to say that it isn't challenging. I think it's moderately difficult for the average player and achivements are well within reach if you try.\n\nMy score: 7.5/10","February 24, 2014","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

On the other hand, don't be fooled, this ain't a puzzle game. Only the minority of the situations requires you to stop and think about what to do. You'll probably quickly figure out what to do and spend more time actually trying to do it. The dimensions, while employed in interesting ways, could be more varied than "Allow you to pick this object" or "Triggers that pressure plate". The Slow-Motion dimension, though, has some very peculiar uses. It's a game that will test your timing and your plataforming more than it will test your wits. Plus, while the characters(or character, seeing as the Professor is the only character who expresses himself in any significant way) are fun, the ending left a bitter taste on my mouth.

It seemed whimsical and fun.\nUnfortunately it actually feels empty and flat. It's like a compilation of discarded gameplay ideas for Portal. Fun, sure enough, but detachted from meaning or context.\nI was expecting greater character interaction than portal had (judging by the cover), but Ike just stands there on some levels and does nothing but look angry from time to time. The end of the game is a complete letdown: the guy on the cover (the player's uncle) isn't ever seen but as a silluette at the very end. Paintings of his ancestors on the walls give more interaction than him. The final "boss" fight is too easy too.\nThe humour might be the best part of this game. The way how things, like the paintings change when you use the special powers, the backstory given for all the characters and how they made fun of popular book titles to fit particle physics somehow is all very well thought out.\n\nSumming up, It's a fun game but not one you'd like to repeat.

You find yourself at the point where you wish it was finished so you could get to the ending sooner. I love complex puzzles, but the puzzles in the game were not really challenging, as much as they were annoying. This is due to the wierd physics and control issues that are constantly happening. I remember many times where I would input controls and the game would not respond the way it should. I also felt like the mouse control itself was clunky, in the sense that I didn't feel like anything was smooth when moving.\n\nThe art work is great in the game, yet gets very repetitive, very quickly. You see the same safe, box, books and atmosphere throughout the whole entire game. The only thing that changes are some of the pictures on the wall and of course the puzzle from room to room.\n\nThe music is fantastic, it is one reason I continued to play through the game. The narrator can also be very funny and when you die, clever comments come up.\n\nI got 3/4 of the way through the game and honestly decided to stop playing. Maybe one day I'll get back to it, but I wanted an ending and the game was just rehashing the same things over and over, most of these things being frustrating.\n\nAfter looking up the ending on YouTube, I feel disappointed in the story of the game as well. The conclusion does not fully wrap up, nor does it make me want more (like a good game should).\n\nSo I do not recommend this game, unless you can get it really cheap (like I did) and you want to play a little bit to pass the time, so that you can mess around with the different dimensions.\n","March 1, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am recommending the game for that fact alone. For those of you who have played Portal, this game roughly features the same premise. You play as a boy who wanders into his Uncle's "lab," gets a "gadget," and then you have to get from point A, to point B in order to "leave."\nFor Portal lovers, there are little bits of of Portal-y goodness that shine through at times, but trust me, this is NOT Portal... and I mean that necessarily isn't a bad thing. The fact is, these characters (especially Ike) grow on you; and while they may not be GladOS level quality, there are some great script moments in the game.

My biggest complaint would be a couple puzzles toward the end of the game that are just miserable and lazy. The rest of it is fun and engaging if only for short bursts. This isn't a bad thing for a typical puzzle game but feels odd for a game which feels like it will grip you like Portal did, and never does.\n\nThe game is often compared to Portal, a better game, to Conundrum's detriment, but it has earned the comparison. It attempts a snarky, dark humored irreverent and unkind narrator.  It has both seemingly deliberate "puzzle rooms" and behind the scenes type puzzle sections, very similar to what Portal offered. The lead designer was one of the original Portal creators and I'm assuming she figured the formula was flawless. Well... It's not flawless but it is pretty darn good.  If you're a game designer, consider playing it just to see how cleverly the dimensional swap mechanics can be used for physics gameplay.","May 27, 2014","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's quite short and not TOO challenging, but the design is really tight and at that price point one can hardly complain.\n\nSome of the sections rely on some pretty deft dimension swaps, which I'm not sure I always cared for, but deaths are minor and don't really upset the game's flow. The game really relies on a few underlying principles and then gradually introduces more complexity. What's nice is it felt like there were multiple solutions to each room, which made it more exciting to experiment.\n\nThe story is told Portal-style and is mainly just a cute aside to bridge together the puzzles. It's intended to be quite kid-friendly so don't expect much depth in that department. Not everything needs to be a grand epic though and, while it's not going to produce big laughs, the voice of John de Lancie will still put a smile on your face.\n\nGood stuff.","January 21, 2013","true","6.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the puzzled are figured out in seconds and then you spend 10+ minutes to fiddle around with the platforming just to execute your solution. Artstyle is pretty awesome, settings are rather poor, all you get is an option to change resolution. However, the UnrealEngine lets you set things via .ini editing.

You find yourself at the point where you wish it was finished so you could get to the ending sooner. I love complex puzzles, but the puzzles in the game were not really challenging, as much as they were annoying. This is due to the wierd physics and control issues that are constantly happening. I remember many times where I would input controls and the game would not respond the way it should. I also felt like the mouse control itself was clunky, in the sense that I didn't feel like anything was smooth when moving.\n\nThe art work is great in the game, yet gets very repetitive, very quickly. You see the same safe, box, books and atmosphere throughout the whole entire game. The only thing that changes are some of the pictures on the wall and of course the puzzle from room to room.\n\nThe music is fantastic, it is one reason I continued to play through the game. The narrator can also be very funny and when you die, clever comments come up.\n\nI got 3/4 of the way through the game and honestly decided to stop playing. Maybe one day I'll get back to it, but I wanted an ending and the game was just rehashing the same things over and over, most of these things being frustrating.\n\nAfter looking up the ending on YouTube, I feel disappointed in the story of the game as well. The conclusion does not fully wrap up, nor does it make me want more (like a good game should).\n\nSo I do not recommend this game, unless you can get it really cheap (like I did) and you want to play a little bit to pass the time, so that you can mess around with the different dimensions.\n","March 1, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, even if the puzzle design was perfect, the issues with the controls and the physics would make the game very difficult (or impossible) to enjoy. And, unfortunately, 30-40% of the puzzles are just repetitive drivel - while the rest contain a few touches of genius.

It ends abruptly when it looks like some action is about to happen and proceeds with a lame "haha you're dead... just kidding" joke that feels anticlimactic as all hell. Not to mention the fact that it doesn't explain anything about what happens next. Not even a proper cutscene with Professor Fitz and the kid. If you hadn't written an ending at all, it would have looked just the same.\n\nOverall, the game was fun and enjoyable, although it starts getting a bit repetitive after a while. Ike is a very silent but charming character and the dialogues were amusing enough. The whole dimension switching concept was promising, yet the execution not so much. Also, the second part of the game feels less like a puzzle game and more like a platformer game, which is ridiculous. I could easily forgive these mistakes, but it's just... The ending just tore apart all the good vibes the game had been giving me throughout the entire thing. I simply cannot shake the feeling of dissatisfaction.\n\nI hardly ever write reviews, and it's quite upsetting that I'm doing it for a Kim Swift game. It's a shame that I feel compelled to say I cannot recommend this game.","May 25, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception.

Instead of a portal gun, though, the player hops between different dimensions, which results in slowing time, making things heavier or lighter, and reverse gravity to solve puzzles.\n\nAnd though the puzzles themselves are masterfully made, creating situations that are intellectually satisfying while remaining simple enough to avoid frustration and utilizing each of the dimensions, the mark that QC missed, mainly, is atmosphere: the uncle (voiced by John de Lancie) is utterly unlikeable (it feels as though they wanted him to be both endearingly eccentric and abrasively intellectual that they missed the mark on both counts) and that the levels, after a while, became very same-y.  I got the feeling that the game was made by an engineer, with a token world built around the levels.\n\nAll in all, I'd give it a B\n\nIf you like physics puzzles (they really are very good) and first person platforming, but can make concessions for world- and story-building, and have already played Portal, then this is a game for you.","July 13, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a fun first person puzzle game, and having John de Lancie (Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation) provide his voice made it so much better. There are a lot of parallels to Portal but that is because this game was made by Kim Swift who made Portal. She even came up with the idea for Quantum Conundrum while she was working on Portal. The puzzles themselves are challenging but not frustratingly so. They are physics based and it can take a few tries to get them to behave the way you want them to. There are also plenty of hidden collectables throughout the game, so you completionists out there can get your fix. One of the downsides is that it was a little short, about six, seven hours to beat (I wasn't doing a collectable run). Overall it was fun, witty, and callenging, everything I look for in a game.\n\n9/10 would science again.","December 16, 2015","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It ends abruptly when it looks like some action is about to happen and proceeds with a lame "haha you're dead... just kidding" joke that feels anticlimactic as all hell. Not to mention the fact that it doesn't explain anything about what happens next. Not even a proper cutscene with Professor Fitz and the kid. If you hadn't written an ending at all, it would have looked just the same.\n\nOverall, the game was fun and enjoyable, although it starts getting a bit repetitive after a while. Ike is a very silent but charming character and the dialogues were amusing enough. The whole dimension switching concept was promising, yet the execution not so much. Also, the second part of the game feels less like a puzzle game and more like a platformer game, which is ridiculous. I could easily forgive these mistakes, but it's just... The ending just tore apart all the good vibes the game had been giving me throughout the entire thing. I simply cannot shake the feeling of dissatisfaction.\n\nI hardly ever write reviews, and it's quite upsetting that I'm doing it for a Kim Swift game. It's a shame that I feel compelled to say I cannot recommend this game.","May 25, 2015","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/recommended/200010/","Illius19616","Illius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Illius19616/","88 products in account","This game is an interesting concept for a puzzle game. You are a kid going to his uncle's (who is a slightly narcisist scientist) when something happens causing a lock-down on the house. Your uncle has a mild loss of short term memory, and can't figure out where he is so he asks you to go restore power to remove the lock-down. In the process you get access to the IDS device that he was working on that allows you to shift between dimensions (More on that soon).\n\nThe story isn't complicated, but it gets the job done and gets you going where you need to be. The dialogue along the way is cheesy, but in a good way (Though if you are not a fan of cheesy humor, I would suggest muting the voices).\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite interesting. You gradually unlock 4 (well, 5 if you count the base dimension) dimensions that allow you to modify physics. These are Fluffy (Or, light weight), Heavy (Heavy weight), Slow down (Everything moves at a near crawl, even lasers), and Reverse Gravity. You, personally never are altered (The idea is despite the fact you are going through the rifts, you personally remain physical to your dimension). Now, these mechanics lead to some interesting relationships between objects: A steel Safe becomes able to be carried while in fluffy, You can toss a table in fluffy then quickly change to Slow and hop onto the platform (That normally would be going fast) as a platform across a gap. A cardboard box can be used as a heavy weight using Heavy. Or with Reverse you can have something utilize the bottom of a conveyor belt to be carried along (or quickly switch to keep it floating). It's not as though you just unlock them all as you go along: Each room has certain dimensions availble (though they can be changed via what batteries you find in the puzzle), so they give you a general direction on how to solve it, and leave it to you to figure out how to use your tools to reach the exit.\n\nIt is worth noting this concept shines in one level in particular: You choose one and only one of the 4 and have to solve the room from there, and based on which one you start with changes the entire solution.\n\nThat said, the puzzle aspect partially comes from how well you can execute it as well (You can only "Table Surf" if you are good enough, after all) so if you are looking for a pure puzzle game, you aren't getting that. That does not make this a fun title though.\n\nThere are also a lot of neat little features, such as how paintings and such change based on the dimension (Example is a painting of a grandmother where in fluffy her hair is insane, where in slow there is a grim reaper standing behind her). Another is that during death or loading screens you get some hilarious dialogue (Things you will never experience because you died #93487: The Zombie Apocalypse (Though this may be for the best)). There are also little knick-knacks in each level that you can hunt for, given a neat sense of exploration, even if all it does is add little dolls in the main lobby.\n\n\nThat all said, there are a few issues. One annoying one is the give-away hints. Your uncle will give you a hint on how to beat the chamber after a while of being in. It's a neat idea, help stumped players get through, but often times he says it after what seems 1 failed attempt (not counting deaths), which means if you don't get a puzzle right first try (whether or not you get the solution) he's gonna chime in and basically become Navi (There is one puzzle where you clearly have to go up, and he constantly goes "You need to get higher.") If the hints were so dead give-away (Almost shouting "HERE IS THE SOLUTION") or he didn't just tell you within moments of entering the room this wouldn't be an issue, but together it can be a bit annoying.\n\nAnother is some questionable hit detection. Numerous times I've been standing on a ledge where suddenly I just get booted off, or I hit a ceiling that still appears numerous feet away. It can cause some annoying and at times frustrating deaths.\n\nThe game itself is also rather short, unfortunately. Though it could be positive because that also means it doesn't over stay it's welcome.\n\n\n\nOn a side note I have seen this game compared to Portal. While it has a Portal feel to it, it's not going to quite get rid of that itch, though it will help satisfy it.\n\n\nOverall, a really fun puzzle game and definitely worth getting if you are looking for an enjoyable game.","August 10, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is very original and fun to play, but the script/ending leave a lot to be desired.  I'd give it a 6/10.  Here are some more details:\n\nPros: The whole dimension-flipping mechanic is very unique and original, and frankly makes for some brilliantly designed puzzle levels and fun gameplay.  If you liked Portal, then you will definitely like this game!  The graphics are also well done and gives the whole game a fun, "cartoony" atmosphere.\n\nCons:  The talking will drive you insane.  The writers clearly wanted to create the same witty, "punny" sort of one-liners as in Portal, but its not funny at all, and the only voice actor in the game completely messes up the delivery.  Moreover, this game will BABY you through every level.  "Look up there!"  "You're gonna want a battery here!"  "Maybe you should like heights, hint, hint" and yes they literally say "hint, hint."  This gives you almost no sense of accomplishment after completing a level, and it made me feel like the developers thought I, as the player, had the intellect of a 1st grader.  Also the ending is a huge buzzkill, big build up to nothing... All the same, this game was worth it to me for all the slow-down scenes :P","January 23","true","12.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time it's fairly obvious what you're supposed to do to pass a level.\n\nUnfortunately, the game requires good timing and ninja like jumping from platform to platform.  If you're the sort who rage quits after the third time of missing a jump and having to restart from the last checkpoint, you'll hate this game.  I don't normally enjoy games that require that sort of exactness, but Quantum Conundrum is apparently my exception.  I'll put up with the annoyances of missed jumps, although sometimes I have to stop playing and take a break before coming back to the level.\n\nThis is a game my ten year old daughter and I play together, and often when she realizes what we have to do to pass a level she shakes her head and says, "Daddy, don't you dare!"

I bought Quantum Conundrum after suffering from Portal withdrawal, and I was so happy when I found it! I am a lover of puzzle games with great stories and characters, and Q.C. excels in all those things! In Q.C. you play as the grandson of an inventor who has been working on a secret project that no one knows about. One day when you go to visit him, you notice he is missing and being the annoying nosy kid you are, you go searching for him through his gigantic mansion. Eventually he contacts you from another dimension in the same house. He informs you of his secret invention seeing as that its the only way for you to save him. A glove that can allow you to switch between dimensions in order to save him. This game is fun and quirky, with cute characters and a fun simple story line. Its really hard though! I got stuck on levels for weeks trying different ways to complete them, but the game does a great job of motivating you to proceed forward. You will be frustrated, you will want to break a whole in you computer but eventually you will see the solution and get through it! 9/10 for any fan of  great puzzle games similer to my favorite game Portal. The only reason it didnt get 10/10 is because I thought the mansion could have been a little more detailed and instead the rooms were kinda repetitive in design, but that doesnt really effect the impact of the story on the player at all.","January 30","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While not quite at the level of Portal, I definitely had my share of confusing and frustrating moments.\n\nStory is not very strong. You simply go into a house and try to fix the problem. While the dialogue tries to be witty, I found it rather boring.\n\nThis game has simple combination of 4 different dimensions that change how you interact with the environment. While it sounds simple, the game makes you combine multiple dimensions in order to solve puzzles.\n\nAt the end, it was a rather mediocre game but if you're into puzzles and looking for something to do, then I recommend this.\n\nHaving said that, wait for it to go on sale. I personally do not think it's worth the full retail.","July 28, 2015","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Originally devised by somebody who worked at valve, a team of designers and the amazing John D Lancie from star trek etc, what could have gone wrong? Well everything because the studio shut down one game later in 2014\n\nThe idea and gameplay is amazing, the idea of switching dimentions. Trying to copy the puzzle formula from Portal but partly succseeding and the other half knock-off from Portal\n\nMy main problem with the game is the story, throughout the game you are explained a 'super IDS' supposedly a upgrade to the glove your character wears to control dimentions. You dreams are shattered when the ending is played. Which everything comes down to a 20 second cutscene of nothing. A interesting story comes to a full stop as if the writer just got up and left and forgot to come back, which is very disappointing.\n\nThere is also DLC but after being so disappointed I decided not to waste time with it\n\n\nThe only good thing that came out of this is the desire for Portal 3 and the TF2 items I recieved when I pre-ordered the game","April 10","false","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The same silent protagonist, radio instructions, concealed mentor, one room – one puzzle rule and so on. But unlike Portal where you had to coordinate just two portals in one dimension, Quantum conundrum offers you four different dimensions. And in my opinion it doesn’t make the game better. It’s not enough just to plan your further actions, you have to use 3 (or sometimes even 4) dimension with extremely precise timing or you will fail. So it’s not the puzzle complexity that pisses you off, it’s the necessity to play some traps over and over again. You may say it is a game for you spinal cord rather than your brain. The other weak spots are the plot and physics engine that doesn’t handle all the dimensions correctly from time to time.\n\nBut it’s still a nice game with humor (put closer attention to the pictures on walls) to amuse yourself for a couple of evenings. 7/10. Gonna check out the Talos Principle now :-)","March 28, 2015","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game introduces new dimensions and concepts at a nice pace and will take roughly 6hrs to complete. The game is very relaxed as the puzzles are not too difficult so you'll always progress at a nice pace, and the game has an excellent art style and direction. The games option menu is very good, different volume sliders, gfx options and fully rebindable keys which is excellent. It certainly feels like a very polished game.\nIf you love games like Portal and Q.U.B.E then you're going to love this game.
