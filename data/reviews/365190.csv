Tastee must be noob friendly, because my experience with the first few hours has been smooth and forgiving. Anyone whom is not a tactical fan, or hasn't ever thought about them, should give this a try. :) (The development team has also stated that they will continue to support the game after launch, so that's a bonus.)\n\nPositive:\n- Smooth first experience.\n- Really intuitive controls.\n- The MOMENTS. I was told that the game was a game of moments, but I didn't really get it. Since the game is based around the concept of time start/stop, you often get .1 seconds away from epic moments like sniper shots or bomb explosions, only to have it freeze for the next planning phase.\n\nNegative:\n- I experienced a few tiny glitches which fixed themselves with no user intervention, mostly attributed to lag.\n- Some controls are prone to user error that one might not notice, but that's my fault for not paying 100% attention when issuing commands.","May 10","true","5.9"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","24","33","0","0"

Every turn is planned out to the last move, position and view angle and the game stands strongest when you take the time to do so.\n\nNow, it needs to be noted that this is a Niche title for sure and that unless you enjoy a slow paced & tactical game play, that it might not be the thing for you. But if you do... boy is this a treat!\n\nA well put together story mode, coupled with a great tutorial set the stage for what you'll learn is some of the most chess-like mind-melding and enjoyable turn based action I've played in ages. With a great variety of maps, an interesting (and mostly balanced) mix of characters to choose form and great use of the environment to obstruct, empower and employ player interaction allows for this game to shine.\n\nUsing the games "preview" mode for turns, you can fine tune every action to your hearts content and coupling that with the A-Sync PvP game play (you can do a turn and log out, and then do your next turn when you log back in) means that you'll have multiple matches going on at any time and that you are not bound by a timer or ticker to force you to take your next action. Very cool.\n\nWhat i'll say as well is that the games controls are quite fiddly. Making you sometimes waste time to get an action "just right". Also the PC Options and performance are bare bones and "acceptable" at best. .\n\nNot perfect, but a damn good turn based tactical action game none the less.\n\n","May 11","true","6.5"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","24","35","2","3"

Some of the others including the abilities and maps are your standard updates expected from an early access game but they are by no means not important. I particularly like the fact that they’ve added an ELO-based player rankings board. Dependent upon how it is implemented it and the size of the player base it should allow for better matched multiplayer games and more accurate rankings.\n\nSkyBox described the game perfectly in the Steam description by explaining the squad-based turn-based asynchronous nature of the game. There is tremendous depth and potential in the game play both as a single and multiplayer game. Both are very much worth experiencing already. The AI has been programmed expertly and makes the single player game a standout. If you don’t have any friends to play against (you can play other random players) and would prefer to play the single-player game then that is your prerogative and you will not feel at a disadvantage for doing so.\n\nThe game play is smooth and intuitive. For a game of this style and nature that is of vital importance. Thankfully SkyBox Labs are absolute standout experts in this area because their experience clearly shines through. This further enables the tense gameplay – you’re drawn in and immersed into each mission (or multiplayer game). You quickly realize that each move could change the outlook on the game so it has that feeling that every little thing matters. Another advantage in this aspect of the game is just how quickly the game progresses. Other games feel lack the pace that this one does. Though I do wonder if playing against slower opponents could lead to a feeling of tedium – which isn’t necessarily a developer created problem but one that may present as a challenge. I could easily see some players attempting to slow the pace of the game down as a tactic.\n\nAt this stage of the game I don’t feel that any member of your squad is overpowered. I’m sure that some of you may end up feeling that way but that may likely be that either you or your opponent has mastered the intricacies that each class brings to the table. However, presently, it certainly feels that should you lose any member of your team that you’re at an equal disadvantage regardless of what class it was that you’ve lost. Likewise with the opposition. Therefore the game feels to be well balanced which again is vital for a game of this type to work as intended.\n\nThere is a problem in the gameplay in that it can pay huge dividends to ‘turtle’ and hide out in hallways and other spots where you can hide away from your opponent. Sadly, there are certain areas on many maps that you know that you will have first chance to fire upon your enemy. This can determine outcomes of matches and unless the final product fixes this issue I can see those who learn to play each map early having an unassailable advantage early after proper retail release. Other than this there doesn’t appear to be anything of particular note wrong with the game.\n\nThere’s more depth in both single and multiplayer aspects of Lethal Tactics to poke a stick at. If it gets the right number of players to have a good competitive scene then there is no reason that it cannot wind up being one of the games of the year of 2016. SkyBox Labs have ushered in a breath of fresh air here and I cannot wait to play more of it.\n\nFor similar reviews and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group please join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified\nFor our Steam curation please follow http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified#curation","February 8","true","7.1"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","19","28","0","1"

I actually went home and played matches after a day of working on the game. TASTEE takes the cerebral gameplay formula of Frozen Synapse then adds more depth and wraps it all in a polished presentation. There is an impressive amount of strategy required to master this game, and it all looks and feels great.\n\nThe single-player aspect of TASTEE is a fully realized feature that may be worth the asking price alone for turn-based tactics fans. The presentation is just as polished as the rest of the game and it's a great way to practice the basic mechanics before going online. Unlocking new mercs is a nice carrot-on-a-stick to push you to the end of the story and a gentle way to learn the units.\n\nTASTEE is a must-play for turn-based tactics fans and Frozen Synapse fans.

If you like planning out moves down to the step trying to mess with your opponent, then Tastee will be a game up your alley, especially if you can find friends and human opponents to play against. For me, it's way too slow: I find myself getting way to impatient for what the game wants from me, and end up walking into a hail of bullets. But if you have patience and really have a tactical mind, the game will reward you as you can play mind games with your opponent and try to lure them into your trap, or bum rush them unexpectedly. Just don't expect the AI to give you a fair fight, as it seems to really screw with you (at least in my experience) by knowing what you're going to do before hand, unless you take things REALLY slow. Trying to find an online game was a problem due to not a lot of people playing, but it may have not been during the core hours (in the evening) when people were on. All in all, there's no much improvement on the Synapse formula here, but it's got a fresh coat of paint that some will appreciate, and maybe a more active fan base (because of the age of that game). It's just not for me, that's for sure.\n\nVideo Review:   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgeHgB7tYa0\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nFrom a tactical chess match standpoint, the game does well, especially against a human opponent.\nThere seems to be reasonably set of maps here to really keep the variety up. At least from an architecture standpoint.\nWhen pulling off a trap or surprise on an opponent, you do really feel like a tactical genius.\nYou really get a lot of control over what you want to do, down to the movement, during the turn. Wait feature is nice, along with the hold on sight.\nLike how each character has his own stats to give them health/aim/etc strengths/weaknesses. Adds to variety.\nRepeatedly throwing explosives were fun as hell.\nNegatives:\nIt's really hard to tell at a glance whether or not you'd be in a line of sight of an enemy. You've got to take your time.\nFor me, it's really, really slow. Too slow. If you don't want to jump right into a trap, you'll go very very slow. And it sorta puts me to a sleep.\nThe game has some loading time issues, when the game ends a turn. It's a bit annoying. Especially when the camera goes off .\nWish the AI had difficulty levels. Felt at times that the AI changed it's strategy suddenly, mostly seemingly reacting to what I was doing (which it shouldn't have known in some of these cases). Really frustrating, especially within the missions.\nSome powers seem way too powerful compared to others. The Scout ability? Don't know why you'd want anything but that from the shotgun classes.\nSound and music design lacked.","May 10","true","3.2"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","24","40","0","0"

Nothing terrible though.\n- Menu and loading screen art need a small overhaul as it feels somewhat placeholder.\n- Only 4 classes. I haven't gotten tired of them yet though (8hrs).\n- Not much of a story, but it really doesn't seem necessary right now.\n- Player base is way too low for the quality of the game. Hopefully it picks up with the new update.\n\n\nMultiplayer is lacking. There needs to be a live mode without timed turns. This would be a good casual midway between the asynchrinous system (take your turn whenever you want, get email updates when it's your turn) and the live game with timed turns. One makes matches feel un-engaging and the other makes them feel rushed. The singleplayer content alone is worth the money, but it would be nice to have an improved multiplayer experience for competitive matches.\n\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the strategy genre and especially turn based games.

The maps are fun to stare at while thinking deep, tactical thoughts, and the units almost look like something out of Team Fortress 2 (a good thing).  Most importantly of all--the gameplay is incredibly nerve wracking.\n\nThe game also doesn't feel unfair; when you lose a unit, it's because the other player got the drop on you (flanked you, got a better sniper position, or predicted which way you’d first look when walking into a room).\n\nThe controls are sufficiently detailed to implement what’s in your head, and firefights can be won or lost based on proper utilization of both larger tactical decisions such as map positioning and unit grouping, as well as the smaller individual unit control decisions such as when to sprint, when to duck behind cover, and when to simply aim down a lane knowing an enemy is likely to walk into your line of sight.\n\nIn short, the amount of detail you can control about your team just feels right.\n\nOn that note, let me list the options you have:\n-sprint\n-crouch\n-free fire\n-hold on sight\n-wait\n-look\n-special move\n\nThat's it!  But despite the relative simplicity of the control options, this game is by no means simple.  The combinations of these control actions, map positioning, and trying to predict your opponent’s actions is what makes this game interesting.\n\nIn regard to the controls and the fact that the game is in early access, I’m actually a little surprised to say that there are really no core gameplay mechanics that need to be added.  Each and every order you have the option of giving to your units is essential and useful at certain points in a match, and I never felt that my ability to control my units was ever lacking in granularity.\n\nThe above-mentioned points make for a fantastic foundation.  All that SkyBox really needs to do is build more onto this foundation--with more unit types, maps, and game modes (and maybe more unit “perk” options).  Additionally (and this is nitpicky) it needs just a few more features added such as easy access to graphics options, mouse scrolling options, and the addition of turn notifications.\n\nOther than that, this is a great example of an early access game done right, and well worth the asking price.\n\nIn summary:\n\n+Looks good (rag-doll physics!)\n+Very polished controls--just the right amount of possible unit actions to think about\n+Intuitive gameplay\n+Asynchronous multiplayer\n+Good replayability\n+Balanced well enough to be competitive, and it’s still in early access (good work!)\n\n-Needs just a little more content\n","May 26, 2015","true","21.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Following a very similar path as Frozen Synapses the premise is simple, each game is broken down into 2 phases the planning stage where you direct the movement, vision and attacks of your 4-5 mercenaries and in the action phases you watch the results of your actions unfold.\n\nObviously to be good at Tastee this means not only being precise with your tactics but also predicting what the enemy is going to do next. So many times I thought I had a perfect strategy only to wrongly predict where the enemy was and get sniped as I walked past a window or suddenly have a grenade land at my feet.\n\nYour team is made up of a bunch of misfits each with a key ability such as long range sniping skills, the ability to throw a flashbang, the ability to conceal or simply put “has the biggest explosions”. Each character has a unique feel but sometimes visually they can be hard to differentiate when zoomed out and lets not even discuss the issue with having 2 characters standing on the same spot and being unable to click on one.\n\nSingle player is as you would expect a selection of missions loosely tied together with a story but in actual fact it acts as one long tutorial for multiplayer slowly drip feeding you a new character and a new ability as you go. It is however pretty tough and only a few missions in I started to feel my rustiness at strategy game starting to shine through.\n\nMultiplayer however is where this game is strong… but only if you know what to expect. See the first time I played this the other player took forever to take his turn and I ended up quitting. But then I realised this game is similar to all those multiplayer mobile games you have played where someone can have many games going on at once and you merely wait until the other player has made their turn… and that could take ages… days in fact. It’s an interesting take on multiplayer but personally I found this choice bizarre and would have preferred time-outs after 5 mins of no activity in order to speed things up a bit.\nWhen things go well however the game is immensely satisfying. Each time you watch the action unfold with no idea of what is actually going to happen, you will either be met with crushing disappointment as 2 team mates die, victory as you kill an enemy or gleeful surprise as you kill 2 by accident.\n\nIn general this is a good game and there is a lot of depth here on offer but the UI is very fiddly and cumbersome. The different actions are controller by a ring display and this includes things such as sprint, crouch look and wait, but the annoying thing is you also have to cancel everything. This means I can somehow have sprinting and crouching selected or my look direction that is totally inappropriate now has to be deselected before I can select a new one. A minor thing on the surface but when a turn in TASTEE takes so many clicks this can drag. Equally movement often doesn’t go the way you and sometimes the maps are not clear where you can and can’t go.\n\nOverall TASTEE is a decent strategy game that bares a strong resemblance to Frozen Synapse so if you enjoyed that you will enjoy this. There is a good game in here but I can’t help but feel that a few tweaks could have made it great… I would give it a thumb to the side if I could.\n\nCheck out our video coverage here:  TASTEE Lethal Tactics Video review[www.thegametutor.co.uk]\n\nIf you enjoyed our review please check out our curator page:  The Game Tutor Curator Page\n","May 21","true","14.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

There is the odd time you find your cannot click on a waypoint to alter the orders set on it. But most of the time its solid. The maps are small, but if they were bigger you would be doing a lot of running around or backtracking trying to get into the right place to ambush or attack. This is not a game for the impatient, its a little bit like chess where you have to think a few moves ahead and control space with your line of sight.\n\nYou can preview your moves and also move the enemy in the same manner with your guesses as to which way they went.

There is a good chance a level editor will come further down the track, which i hope will be added at somepoint because it will give the game much more longevity over time with community maps. Also note this game comes with two free gifts of the game you can give away to friends.\n\nOver all i would give this game 9/10\n","May 13","true","6.6"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

If this sounds enticing, then it is likely that you will fall in love with TASTEE: Lethal Tactics.\n\nDeveloped by SkyBox Labs, this charming game has a simple premise: There are two stages in every game, the planning stage and the action stage. The planning stage involves orchestrating the movement and vision of your small squad of mercenaries, whilst the action stage illustrates the results of your actions. Whilst this may seem quite simple on paper, the actual game can get quite deep and tactical, especially in some of the later missions in the game’s 30 mission story mode. Throw in a tense but flawed multiplayer mode, with all the bells and whistles of competitive play, and you have a real fun time on your hands.\n\nThe game starts off with a short but effective tutorial, it does not throw you in the deep end with all the toys and expect you to swim your way out of it. The controls are quite easy to learn and the game’s single player story mode slowly drip feeds new characters and new mechanics to ensure that by the time you finish the story mode, you are ready for the multiplayer action. The story mode did get progressively harder without ever getting to an ‘unfair’ stage. You unlock different mercenaries that each bring something new to the table, whether it be through the ability to snipe or even the ability to use flash bangs. The enemy AI is smart enough to constantly flank and harass you at every opportunity, so it really important to ensure that your squad is versatile to deal with any unexpected threats.\n\nFurthermore, the maps are all varied with each level having multiple routes to the destination, however it is important to note that it is the journey and not the destination that matters. Positioning is key in this game, having a squad member in the correct place at the correct time could be the difference between success and failure. Sometimes it can be a bit hard to gouge the exact field of vision for an enemy troop, so this could lead to a few deaths, but overall the game does an excellent job at showing you exactly where your actions will lead you. So the Story mode does a great job at introducing you to this game, but what about the rest of the game?\n\nThe bread and butter of this game comes through the tactically tense multiplayer experience it can offer. Think of it as a 1 v 1 game of chess, but with guns and explosions. But why did I label it as ‘flawed’ earlier on in this article? That is simple, the game currently does not possess a timer for the multiplayer turns. This can be very frustrating at times since your opponent could go out for dinner, take a walk on the beach, come back home and then end his turn. Stay away from this game if you are looking for a quick round of multiplayer entertainment, instead there is the ability to play multiple different online games at once and keep switching between them. Personally, i’m not a fan of this sort of method as it makes the pace of the game really slow, but if you are a patient person, then you may not see this as a flaw and instead this may be the perfect game for you. This subjective issue aside, the multiplayer is fantastic when you finish a full game in one sitting.\n\nOverall, the wide variety of characters, the intriguing tactical design and the engaging multiplayer make this game a must buy for video game fans who are after a deep and tactical online squad based tactics game. Allowing me to exert complete control over my small squad of up to 6 different mercenaries and helping manoeuvre them through the varied maps with finesse definitely felt great. This game makes you feel like the conductor of an explosive orchestra, fine tuning your actions until they go off. Just like the owner of this website’s sex life, its a lot of planning with very little action at the end, but it is oh so satisfying when it goes just right. Definitely worth the current price on the steam, i’d highly encourage you to try out this game.","May 25","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However it can be quite complicated.\nThe single player is nearly non existent, however, multiplayer is a lot of fun. It's like taking turns playing chess, where you can multiple games at once. I've won games that didn't seem anything close to a win for me. I've tried keeping a tie in lost games, and I lost games where I was sure I would win.\nThe tension while playing those games is very high, for a turn based game. You are always wondering, what will the opponent have done in the meantime, and when the turn unfolds, you might have predicted their every move, which feels very satisfying. Only problem currently, is that there aren't that many players online ususally, so you have to wwait quite some time for opposition every now and then.\n\n+ Multiplayer is fantastic\n+ Predecting opponents movement is fun\n- Singleplayer is lackluster\n- Player base is currently very small\n","May 13","true","9.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","2"

No other game has made me realise that better than TASTEE: Lethal Tic Tacs. You have four squad members which you tell what to do (i.e. XCOM), but you have to do it at the same time before committing to your order, and watching them go and do it, not having any idea what the enemy will be doing with their four squad members.\n\nThe combat is swift but brutal, each operator having different weapons and abilities at their disposal. They will follow your orders and then any enemy that enters their line of sight will be focused by a narrowing cone of vision that will fire upon the enemy as soon as it has fully closed (i.e. Desperados) - it means placement and direction of your soldiers is arguably the most important thing in the game.\n\nThe controls can be awkward at times and the online can be pretty dead, but otherwise the game is great and one of the most unique turn-based strategies I\'ve had the pleasure of playing.","June 1","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Of course, he's only so hard because he's been playing this awesome game all day long.\nClick here for an entertaining look at the first mission.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M77Tv--9SUE\nIn TASTEE, you need to be very methodical and carful with every tiny move you make.  Once you get the hang of it and pick up the pace, it's even more fun.\nMy biggest gripe is that there doesn't currently seem to be anything to spend your earnings on.  It'd be nice if you could spend your cash on upgrades of some kind.\nAlso, like I said, it's pretty dang hard.  The AI always seems to know where your characters are, and critically, where your characters are looking.  This might not be the case, but the AI sure seems to have an unfair advantage.  But you might be into that! Multiplayer, of course, would be a different story.  But waiting for another player to finish their planning can take AGES.  So grab a beer.\nOverall, it feels like the game is ALMOST done.  Interesting and fun take on turn-based tactics.  Add the ability to upgrade, strip the AI of its advantage, and you've got yourself a solid game.\nIf you're really into tactical games like this, I'd say it's a buy.  Otherwise, maybe wait a bit and see if the devs tweak it a little more.\nCheers!","May 9","true","4.3"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","25","5","20","3","0"

Even though I've discovered I was absolute garbage at it, and probably should go back to playing something like Jagged Alliance so I can gain some confidence back.\n\nThis game will grab you, shake you, beat your head into a wall, swallow you whole, and then fart you out the other side with a smile on its face. Seriously. This game is not easy. Not easy in the slightest.\n\nFor more than 2 decades I've played games like Jagged Alliance, Commandos, XCOM, SWAT, Shadow Watch, Fallout Tactics, and more.... But I've never seen a challenge like this. This game really makes you plan out your moves carefully. The wrong soldier at the wrong time and splat your new interior decoration.\n\nThe game is fun, its got a lot going for it, and as it develops I'm sure it will get a bit easier to play and succeed. But in the mean time, it's a wonderful challenging experience.\n\nYou can see my full first time play session at:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFwaDOpwQPw\n\nBut be warned. The first hour, You'll see me die more ways than if you were playing Five Nights at Frieddy's. I've always been a sucker for a good challenge and this one is going to take more than 1 play session to figure out. I look forward to streaming this one over the next few months as it comes into final form.\n\nOr. I might just be the worst player that ever played :D.\n\nFoghladha\nGaiscioch Side Quests Livestream\nhttp://gsch.info/sidequests","May 21","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
