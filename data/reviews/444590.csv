Two of my main concerns: punishing difficulty with little reward and no tutorial have since been addressed after my first writing of this review a month ago. The tutorial is basic, but it serves it's purpose well. It also is a good place to get some Vitae initially. And it seems (it could just be time since I last played playing tricks on me) but the amount of vitae dropped is much more than before and feels like a just reward for trading blows.\n\nThe aesthetic is something I liked quite a bit. Something about the pixel art style really lends itself to this game. The enemies are well designed, but I found some of the areas a bit muddy while others were very detailed.\n\nI liked it. A lot. It's sort of a Souls clone, but not really. Many errors and shortcomings have been addressed and quickly. The developer is also highly attentive; a bug was reported in the forums and fixed within minutes. I've decided to keep the game for that reason alone.\n\nNEW EDIT I have started to play more to give my review both more credibility and to give the game a much more fair shake now that it is out of EA. I stand by my review: the game has ironed out many of its rough parts, feels solid, and it is the kind of exploratory game that others would enjoy immensely.\n\nTLDR: Buy this game for the current price? Worth it IMO if you enjoy challenge and exploration with a creepy atmosphere.","April 27","true","2.9"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","15","22","0","12"

Kinda disapointed since the resolution is so, lets say, unoptimized.\n\nBut basicly, you play as a clunky Sepiroth that woke up in the Bloodborne universe and have to go visit Luigis Mansion for some reason. I would give more details but since the resolution is so off, i can hardly read the text that explains what the "story" is.\n\nI like the ideas that the creator/creators had. Only played like 10min or so, going to play more, but I rather play it when it's done than an "unlisted early access". The game needs a lot of polish, the movement is being blocked by angles near walls, you cant fight near walls since your sword will get blocked by the terrain and so on.\n\nAll and all, I'd say its interesting, even if it has copied like 80% from bloodborne (combat, enviroment, resources , characters and so on... of what i've seen so far ). But I'll keep an eye on this for now and future development. WELL WORTH the price though (at release almost 6,79€ at sale, 7,99€ full price ), so if you are a Dark soul / Bloodborne fanatic like me. Give it a try.\n\nMy nice and naughty list:\n\n+Good sound\n+Pixel Art\n+Interesting concept\n\n-Clunky movement\n-Combat is subpar ( you can counter enemies but they immidiatly attack back and they cant be staggered)\n-resolution\n\n~Feels like to much is ripped from other IPs ( altough i guess its hard to come up with new things in this day and age)\n\nIt feels like this game would have been much better if it was compleatly 2D with just left,right and a jump button. I understand the idea of "exploration", although it feels like as the game is right now, it just shoots it self in the foot, so to say.","May 27","true","0.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","69","11","16","6","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shmumbler/recommended/444590/","shmumbler","shmumbler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shmumbler/","1645 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nShrouded in Sanity is essentially an attempt at a 2D Bloodborne, and it becomes obvious as you play it. Combat consists of a combination of light/heavy attacks, guarding, parrying and riposting, and dodging. Defeating foes grants you Vitae, the life-force of enemies which you use as the in-game currency. However, despite its obvious ties to Bloodborne, the atmosphere and visuals remind me more of Castlevania, as the mansion holds a majestic, yet mysterious Gothic feel to it, aided by the outfits and general designs of characters and enemies.\n\nUnfortunately, though, Shrouded in Sanity suffers from the lack of polish one may expect from early access. Combat is clunky. The gun mechanic works much the same was as in bloodborne. However, many enemies require you to be within a certain range before they'll start their attack animation: a range which places your gun through them and thus causing you to miss the parry. In addition, the controls just feel strange. I'm sure a large part of it is just getting used to a new control scheme, much like the Souls games were when I first started them. However, I question placing sprint as B and roll as X, as this makes it rather difficult to transition from sprint to roll without accidentally hitting one of the other two face buttons. I also believe that having the gun require holding LB and pressing RB to be rather unusual; if the only thing one can do with a gun is a normal shot, why bother having a multi-button input at all? Why not simply have LB be a shoot command?\n\nOther issues include stamina regen, which is sluggish to say the least. For instance, if you use a heavy attack against a common enemy, you will never get yourr stamina nearly back to full, or at least not without some kiting. In addition, enemies seem to be damage sponges. By this I don't necessarily mean that they have too much HP. Rather, the enemies never stagger, even for a moment, unless they are parried. This even gets to the point that an enemy will throw out an attack or two between you landing the fatal blow and them actually dying. As a whole, these issues just make combat painful and unsatisfying.\n\nOne other tiny complaint goes toward the in-game economy. In the short time I have played, I've come across one merchant who sells bullets. However, bullets are apparently ridiculously expensive for how easily consumed they are. A single bullet costs over 1000 Vitae, whereas each enemy at that stage gives little more than 100. This means that you have to grind 10 enemies for a single bullet. Admittedly, this doesn't sound like much of a task, but there are surprisingly few enemies scattered about, which means buying bullets is just not economically feasible.\n\nThat said, all of my complaints so far are just about polish and balance. That is, these are issues that are easily fixed and simply need time. As such, I have no problem recommending this game, and I admit that I am excited to see where this goes.","April 29","true","4.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","3"

It's basically Bloodborne: Pixel Edition. And the game is challenging with solid mechanics. It does need a lot more polish tho and some improvements to the frame rate for weaker hardware like us indie laptop gamers, but that is expected in an Early Access title.","May 7","true","2.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, the difficulty is not rewarding - maybe because I saw the game as a mix of Dark Souls and Castlevania SotN, and then I expected some item drops, besides bullets and that other thing whose name I forgot.\nAnd the stamina charging rate is quite low... I was fighting the Fourth Knight, and I was like "ok, I think I got this" and then he got me.\nMoveset is not fast, but it is not slow either - maybe it needs to be a little tad faster, or more fluid (like in Crawl).\nFinally, it has potential to stand on its feet. Needs some polishing to leave everything neat and solid.","April 28","true","1.8"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"
