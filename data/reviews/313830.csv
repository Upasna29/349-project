"http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/recommended/313830/","markdj","dj.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/markdj/","2975 products in account","If you take a quick look at some of the screenshots you might think you’re dealing with an action adventure game here, but you’d be very wrong. See No Evil is actually an isometric puzzle game focused on sounds. No, this is not a rhythm game, but a game where you have to manipulate sounds in order to advance through the levels.\n\nThe (rather vague) story of See No Evil takes you through several chapters, each chapter consisting of a good amount of levels that will test both your patience and intelligence. Like pretty much any puzzle game out there the game starts easy but progressively becomes harder. But, to be honest, there are some pretty easy levels later on as well (or easier, at least). So it has a nice mix of both. Great for the gamers that usually get stuck later when puzzles sometimes become too difficult to solve (like me). But it’s not so great for those that are looking to be challenged until the very end of a game. I do think the difficulty is a bit inconsistent here, because the game doesn’t need to throw easier levels at you in order to tell its story. Still, I appreciated the fact that it made things easier every now and then. After a hard day of work I don’t want to think too long about how to solve a certain puzzle.\n\nSo, the game is based on sound manipulation so whenever your character moves pulsating circles can be seen at your feet. These circles mark a certain distance before anyone hears you; get too close to an enemy and he will hear you and finally start chasing you. But push a box in front of you and it will block a part of these sounds and because of it you can easily get past this same enemy.\nLater in the game horns are also introduced. Scream into one and the produced sounds will travel further. These horns are shaped like an L so if you rotate enough of them you can let the sounds travel around in circles, or other any way you want them to, until something (usually a row of blocks) stops it from continuing.\nThere are even more things that you have to manipulate before you can continue; for example, snow leaves a trail so it’s recommended to walk around a few blocks so that you aren’t immediately noticed by an enemy. Switches also have to be used to solve puzzles, sometimes with blocks, other times without them. The later levels will combine all of these elements together to create deep and tough puzzles.\n\nGraphically the game looks pretty. It’s all made in 2D and the game itself has a somewhat dark atmosphere. But not too dark. There’s nothing twisted, freaky or creepy here, just some weird stuff.\nThe main character reminded me a bit of the character from Bastion. This could just be a coincidence I guess. Anyway, everything is well animated and it all looks good. Your character does walk rather slow, though, and it’s one of my minor complaints. Speeding things up with a patch would only break the game so I know for a fact that it won’t be fixed and it’s not even game breaking, but it is slightly annoying if you ask me.\nThe sounds effects are fairly basic, with some guns rattling and a whole lot of screaming. I must admit that I’ve heard more comforting sounds in my life, but these do fit the game’s style.\nThe music on the other hand is quite good. Good but also repetitive.\n\nSo far the game has taken me 3-4 hours to get where I am (I think I’m near the end of chapter 3) and since there are 4 chapters I guess it could take one roughly 5-7 hours to finish it, which is more than enough for a puzzle game these days. For the hardcore gamers the developer integrated New Game+. I only assume the game will mix puzzles up should you choose to do this, and maybe there are some extra puzzles in it as well, who knows ?\n\nSee No Evil is a love it or hate it kind of game I think. But, this is usually true for most puzzle games. I for one enjoyed it (still am enjoying it actually) because it has a good mix of simple and complex puzzles and its mysterious story kept me intrigued up until where I am now. I will definitely finish this one soon, that’s for sure.\nIf you enjoy puzzle games, even for just a little bit, then this is a game you should absolutely play. It can ‘easily’ be finished in one long sitting or in smaller sessions where you just finish a couple of levels each time. It doesn’t really matter; just take your time and enjoy the ride.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","September 2, 2014","true","4.7"," 45 of 48 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","45","48","2","1"

This game is fantastic. Very few games utilize sound as a game mechanic, and this one pulls it off perfectly. Your footsteps make noise and alert the baddies, your voice calls them in your direction. You should to manipulate the  puzzles. Simple premise that is rarely used and has so much potential and variety.\n\nThe game controls very easily which leaves you to focus on the puzzles which will sometimes cause you to take a step back and think twice before entering into a level. The animation and art styles are unique and beautiful, and the puzzles are challenging but not rage quit inducing.\n\nDefinitely worth every penny and I recommend everyone give this game a try at least once.

You manipulate the world around you by shouting to distract guards, push and pull objects to manipulate your shouts. Steam achievements are an essential addition,\n\nI wouldn't say it lives up to SOME of the reviews I've seen, I'm definately enjoying slowly progressing through the campaign and the puzzles are becoming more and more difficult, as you would expect. Other than that I really can't think of much else to say.. I guess the atmosphere is ok, I'm not getting the full benefit playing on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptop though.\n\nThe only controls I've come across so far is UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, SPACE BAR (SHOUT), E (PUSH/PULL) - nice and simple\n\nNot sure if it's worth £10.99 to be brutally honest though - although still early days\n\nIf you can get it on offer go for it","October 18, 2014","true","9.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
