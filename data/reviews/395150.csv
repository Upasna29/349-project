There are many other games that will give you more for your investment.\n\nThat aside, the technical issues are just too plentiful for what is presented to us to be enjoable.\n\n1: The A.I. only has two modes; Potato, and wall-hack. It's a 50 / 50 shot that when you come around a corner a guard will already be shooting at your, or staring at you, oblivious to your existence.\n\n2: The aim down sights is terribly off. The further away from someone you are, the lower you have to aim. Once you get about half a room away (20 or so yards / meters) you have to aim at their belt to get a headshot.\n\n**update** So, the issue isn't as drastic currently, but it's still very off. The current bullets are hitscan instead of raycast, but the hitscan sensor detects AFTER the kick of the gun, instead of before, causing bullets to jump, and causing aim down sights to be off increasingly more as you get further from the enemy.\n\n3: Enemy health seems to be based off their alert status. What would normally take one or two bullets, once an enemy sees you / is attacking you, could take half a clip. I believe this has more to do with the animations. **tentatively seems to be fixed**\n\n4: The animations, or the ones that work, are just broken. Don't believe me? Try picking up a dead guy. The first five seconds of the gameplay where you cycle through crouch, prone, crouch, and standing is just a mess.\n\n5: Picking up dead guys just doesn't work. Out of the 50 test runs I did attempting to pick up a dead body from all different angles, I was successful once. I was then treated to a ballet of terrible animation as the guys ragdol flailed into my shoulder.\n\n6: Picking up stuff / interacting with stuff works about 30% of the time. You have to have a very specific angle to interact with almost everything, and even then it almost never works. You have to reload after every failed attempt to be able to interact with the monitor to set your difficulty.\n\n7: Sound. Literally everything about it.\n\nAll in all, as stated before, this game has some serious potential, but this itteration just feels like a hastily assembled pre-alpha. Neither the stealth, or the first person shooter aspects of this work to any sufficient degree to merit looking at this. Hopefully when the game is ported over to the Unreal Engine 4 most of these issues will be fixes, but as it stands, follow the project, but don't quite put your money on it yet.","December 13, 2015","false","1.9"," 60 of 75 people (80%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","80","60","75","4","6"

These guys are doing game-design the right way, focusing on solid game fundamentals rather than hyped up nonsense.\n\nWill Dark Storm end up being the Syphon Filter esque successor that I've been waiting for?  I don't know.  But I do know that if more devs followed this strategy the industry would be in a better place, and that alone is enough of a reason to support them.","August 23, 2015","true","0.1"," 88 of 128 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","88","128","3","3"

Not a developer to be deterred, Fenrir is determined to prove commitment to the project by releasing a mini-version of Dark Storm : Ascension in the form of Dark Storm : VR Missions. There are currently 10 weapons and 10 stages to play around in, but no objectives to be seen. Is it a promising Early Access title? Partially. You can go through killing everything, or turn on a stealth mode that ends the simulation once you're caught.\n\nThe stealth aspects still need to be tightened, and the hip-fire needs to be loosened. Enemy AI is hardly consistent and they will stop chasing you to follow a thrown noise-maker even while you're still in sight. I find it hilarious to treat the enemies like a dog, who is endlessly tricked by a fake throw of a ball, but it doesn't make for very engaging gameplay.\n\nI like the colorful design of the levels, as well as the realistic gunfire and spot-on voice-acting. Depending on the story we could be looking at the next Deus Ex, or the next Solarix. If you haven't heard of Solarix (or read my review), there is a very strong reason for that. This game is leagues ahead of Solarix in terms of the stealthing and combat, and while there are still a number of screws to tighten in the form of hip-fire, stealthing, and enemy AI but overall I experienced no crashes, had a fair bit of fun, and remain quite hopeful.\n\nFull text review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/new-release-dark-storm-vr-missions/\nQuick Look video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tIwvp4ojEPo","August 30, 2015","true","0.6"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","24","38","5","0"

I hope that is just a poor choice of words and will be more than a demo, I read buyers will get a discount towards the finished product, better give the option to pay more for the second half of the game?\n\n2) Very glitchy, in the first few minutes my gun disappeared, got stuck in mid-air, was seen through walls and killed repeatedly instantly at the start of mission 2 and it crashed.\n\n3) Controller map (I tried all buttons and did a few of the tutorials), but couldn't figure out how to do things like crouch (behind cover and for silent steps) and such. Also the option to change views (top down to see the map layout, 1st, 3rd person), would be helpful. These can probably be fixed easily.\n\n4) AI is lacking and with limited tools or the option of a radar its more just guessing and popping out hoping nobody will see you or is coming around the corner. If no radar maybe peeking to remain covert would be nice since it is a stealth game. Some even seen me through walls resulting in near instant death over and over.\n\n5) Environments (no vents and such like deus ex style) and tools so far are a bit linear with few decent hiding places, lacks lures and methods to beat a mission. Mostly just shoot as many from with a silencer from afar or ko from behind before getting into a fps typical gun fight. Only a few missions so far as well from what I saw.\n\nI will be patient and play it a bit more, but in the current state it is not that fun until these issues are addressed. So right now am unsure, but expect it will be a solid game like Root! Its much different from Volume as well (which has no guns and is only top-down view). I like the idea/needed niche so want to support the efforts since we need more stealth games.","November 14, 2015","true","0.5"," 20 of 32 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","20","32","0","8"

Granted, it still has its bugs and issues, but that's understandable for an early access prototype. Combat is fun to say the least...It took me a while to get used to all the controls, but once I got the hang of things, I managed to get through those levels pretty efficiently. You are punished when trying to blast through enemies, which makes the game challenging and encourages you to use your stealth abilities to complete a mission. Unfortunatley its lacking a cover system, crawling through vents and any type of reward system. I find myself wondering if I even completed a mission as there is no indication of whether or not you completed it. However, I was informed that some of those issues would be addressed in coming updates. You can't enter the arena level at this point, so im hoping that will be added in future updates too! I would like to see those different enemy types in the encounters room implemented into each vr mission as well..and maybe the arena? wink wink ;D I'm a big supporter of indie games that strive to create something as ambitious as this game...so ill be keeping an eye out and playing through each update as this game moves forward in development. I see a lot of potential here, and im excited to see what improvements are made in the coming months.\n","August 27, 2015","true","14.9"," 14 of 23 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","14","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAnimaal/recommended/395150/","MrAnimaal","MrAnimaal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrAnimaal/","406 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDark Storm VR Missions is a futuristic stealth action game, that gives a Hitman & Deus ex feeling while doing VR testing in dangerous environments.\n\nWhen starting Dark Storm VR missiosn, we quickly discover Hitman in a girly version, with the feature of 3'd and 1'd person view. Not only is Amber a qualified VR testing subject, but also very experienced to use firepower and defeating enemies. Yet that she feels like to be hitman's cousin, then we can use her skills either with controller or keyboard. The interesting futuristic feature we have is to deploy a machine to check cornors and the whole map for enemies, which is handy for our stealth missions.\n\nAccording to missions and content, we have 6 VR testing areas to demonstrate our skills until the final and arena is unlocked. The storyline is not yet finished, where we can sit tight till we can show the world our Hitman version, in Amber style. Dark Storm VR missions is still in EA stage, which is why we don't see much detailed art work or textures around the areas yet.\n\nI like where this game is going, and it gives me a hitman & Deus Ex feeling of it's current difficulty and mechanics. If you enjoy stealth games, then i can highly recommend having a eye out for this one.\n\nHere is a demo:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWhmwipTcr0&list=PLxDx_O1l8oBvtrb6rFAut0VdVg88ph01R","October 9, 2015","true","5.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

The best way I can explain this game is, it's a ten dollar version of Tron meets Metal Gear Solid. Yes it is very buggy and somewhat awkward to control but it is making progress. I'm loving it so far and am seriously hopeful they'll get the rest of the kinks worked out. Even as it is I'd say it's worth getting on a 40-50% sale but if they work out all the issues it has now then it's definitely worth the full price.","April 6","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
