Can't explain it really... I recommend all the Build-A-Lot series! I have played only 2 and 3 but I know 'cause I have seen how Build-A-Lot 4 and Build-A-Lot 1 are. They are as awesome as the others. So I recommend buyng the whole bundle.","October 10, 2011","true","2.4"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
