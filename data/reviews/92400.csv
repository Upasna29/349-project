Let me tell you about my experience. Obviously this is an "anything goes" game, and we embraced this exactly how it was meant to be embraced.\n\nI'm with a group of 3 other people, all of whom are males about 16-19 years old. We have a small living room with an open space about 10 feet away from the computer/our buttons, and it's wide enough to give us ample room between each other. We have one keyboard and three xbox controllers all lined up in front of us on the computer's end of the living room. From left to right, I'm second in line.\n\nAs soon as our button pressing prompt appeared on the screen and we set off towards our controllers, I jumped on the person to my right and clung to him. (Un)fortunately, this is that one friend who is 200 lbs of raw muscle, so while he may have been stunned for a brief moment when I hit him, he simply dragged me along the carpet until we got near our controllers. He started mashing the buttons on his controller, and I panicked -- I reached over and managed to wrestle the controller away from him, and I then threw his controller across the room.\n\nI looked back at my controller to see the person on my left was mashing my buttons in an attempt to ♥♥♥♥ me up. The only thing I could manage to do from my current sideways position was use my legs to get him away from my controller, which is exactly what I did: I kicked the ♥♥♥♥ out of him until he was forced to retreat to his own side of the room, at which point I turned my attention to my own controller. Only problem was, I didn't know how many times my button had been pressed, so I pressed it a few times in an attempt to get lucky.\n\nI wasn't lucky. The winner of that round was the person on the very right, who won simply because no one decided to pummel him and ruin his day.","May 4, 2015","true","0.9"," 22 of 22 people (100%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","100","22","22","19","0"

If you're going to be throwing a party with your friends, and they are even slightly interested in games, whether physical or computer based, I would highly recommend that you pick up B.U.T.T.O.N.\n\nP.S.\nIf you drink alcohol while you play, don't break anything.\n\n8/10 for original concept.","August 27, 2014","true","1.7"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","6","12","0","0"

But as far as party games go, I think this one is so simple (as simple to play as it probably was to make) that you'll have fun for a couple minutes, but quickly realize how dumb it is and how it has no content AT ALL (which to be fair, I think it was the point).\n\nUnless you're in the right audience, probably very casual gamer or looking for a very cheap game only. If you're just a bit over casual gamer in terms of how much you play, you've got better party games in your radar with 100% certainty.\n\n(Unless you're playing with, perpetuating a stereotype here, old people who don't really know how to play party video games and can only have fun with the simplicity of this game. But then again, the goal is often implicitly to shove your opponents out of the way, which is also part of why this game is not a good idea, even less with older people.)","November 25, 2013","false","0.1"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

One, it works with the steam overlay, and two it seems stable and doesn't crash.  Beyond that B.U.T.T.O.N. can not really be enjoyed.  The game entirely consists of team competitions of pushing a button a certain number of times.  Not a mix of buttons mind you, but the space bar or A button on the controller only.

You can use a keyboard. I prefer when playing with other people to play with Xbox 360 Controllers since they are alot easier to play with and you dont have to worry so much about braking them. The game is very simple, you read what is on the screen and do it accordingly then you get pushed to push the button that you are assigned to multiple times or not at all. It can be rewarding and frustrating to play with friends who cheat and try to throw off your character by pushing your button. The game is good but can get old really fast when it says the same thing in a different way a couple times. I recommend this game to people that have friends or want to do something different with their better halves. Its simple and fun, but frustratingly maddening all at the same time.","June 3, 2012","true","28.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
