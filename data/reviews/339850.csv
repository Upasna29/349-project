I would prefer it having more puzzles and fewer passive plot triggers (by that I mean walking to a particular location or talking to someone without good reason  to make progress).\n\nDespite some gameplay issues, this is a really interesting and engaging story with some well thought out characters. It will provide a good 8-10 hours of entertainment.\n\nThe premise is that you a\re a psychiatrist who is called on to investigate 5 unusual and possibly related cases in an isolated asylum on Staten Island. The background of your patients soon appears suspicicious and at the same time the main character has complications in his personal life that make things very difficult to handle.\n\n\nThe downside is that there aren't any real puzzles. You have an inventory much like a traditional point and click but any puzzles involving that are really easy.The game is somewhat artificially drawn out by the mechanic of interviewing patients- you need to play audio clips at your patients and the choice of clip and/or which patient you'e supposed to be interviewing at a particular time doesn't really make a lot of sense. So you end u wandering back and forth until something happens. It gets tedious after the second chapter of the game.\n\nFortunately the story, voice acting and graphics keep it interesting and enjoyable.\n\n\nIn short, an intriguing story with good acting and excellent atmosphere  only mildly hampered by a clunky mechanic.","April 12, 2015","true","5.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","28","30","0","0"

Im going to say I recommend this game but only just. theres only ONE major fault with this game and its this: theres no way of knowing what to do next. frustrating. you do various things like ringing your ex wife up on your mobile or your lawyer just to see if youve"triggered" something that will forward you in the game. besides this its a good game. its a good story you want to find out more . and I like how you play different characters.","May 14, 2015","true","20.2"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

It has a decent, if predictable, plot and some excellent writing in spots. It even has an interesting stab at an achronological narrative. All of which is ruined by tedious, repetitive gameplay.\n\nI won't spend much time summarizing the plot to avoid spoilers, it builds logically on the hook given above. It's predictable but well done, and would probably have made a good movie or novel or really anything other than a video game. The gimmick to the story is that it is told out of order through flashbacks by a group of mental patients, and from a storytelling perspective that is done well. The flashbacks build on each other and occasionally reveal different perspectives on events or answer questions raised by earlier flashbacks. What you wouldn't guess from the product summary is that the characterization is, within the limits of the terrible graphics and voice acting, surprisingly good at times. David McNamara, the player proxy and best match for a protagonist, is not a pleasant person, or the person he is initially presented as, and his character is revealed over the course of the game in a way that plays off the main plot. If the person who did the script for this game wrote a novel, I'd probably give it a look.\n\nBut none of that really matters, because the game part of this game is mostly, I'd say roughly 70-80% of what you do, is moving between five rooms with unmoving patients and playing sound clips to them in order to unlock a flashback section. The problem with this is that you have to do it over and over again, and in every case you've already heard everything you're playing back. This could have been a clever mechanic, but the poor signposting and the repetitive nature of the "puzzle" just kills the momenutm of the game unless you're using a walkthrough, and even then you spend far too much time jogging back and forth.\n\nThe flashback sections themselves are mostly alright. Those that have gameplay, a lot are only cutscenes, are typical point and click adventure game puzzles. Most of these are fine within the limits of the occasionally annoying camera system, and the occasional "stealth" puzzle that requires you to assume that someone turning their head slight becomes suddenly unable to see something that is still happening right in front of them.\n\nIf you like the idea of the story, and you can get it cheap, you may want to pick this up and go through it with a walkthrough, but otherwise you're better off finding a better point and click adventure elsewhere.","April 13, 2015","false","7.4"," 26 of 40 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","26","40","0","0"

Point and click Adventures.\n\nNot for graphics, or intense gaming, but for a story, atmosphere, and puzzles.\n\nSometimes you find a gem.  This one however is a turd.  No puzzles, poorly written story, bland uninterested voice actors, and your usual cast of scooby doo/scream characters.  It's almost like one of those interactive novels, except for the occasional "ok, what exactly am i supposed to do now"?  Most of which is "why wont my character go to sleep to advance to the next day? Oh i didn't collect a letter at the front desk and have a drink at the bar.  Nice "puzzle".  It's all topped off with a wonderful depressing, gray, bleak atmosphere, but without any "thrill" or "creepyness" getting in the way of the boredom.\n\nGame crashes every couple of hours or so.\n\nAvoid if you can.","May 17","false","9.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","2"

Id say its pretty damn hard to feel the characters when dialogues sound as half-♥♥♥♥♥ as they do.I understand they might not have had the budget to hire better qualified actors but the ones they had certainly could do a better job.That combined with how poorly they are scripted and boring leaves a very poor impression right from the start of the game (and it gets worse as it progresses)\n\n-Soundtrack.Or id say almost complete lack of it.You get some ambient sounds now and then and a mildly tense music playing in tense scenes but thats it.You might as well put on a music yourself.I ♥♥♥♥ing fell asleep an hour and half into the game,what is this ♥♥♥♥?\n\n-Choppy animations.You can look past the average graphics in adventure games (i sure can) but poor character animations can ruin all your attempts in immresion.If you have to play this game i strongly reccomend using a walkthrough because the time it will take you to just run around and exhaust every option will take a huge amount of time : be it calling someone on the phone and waiting 15 to 20 sexonds to realise nobodys going to answer or unreasonable framerate drops in dialogues.\n\nIm not going to outline the pros or cons of the plot because it wouldnt be fair since i havent beaten the game but you might get by now what my thoughts on that are.\n","December 15, 2015","false","3.0"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","3","9","2","0"

Even with a walkthrough to get past all the "puzzles", it's painfully slow.\n\nThis is one of those old-school adventure games where most of your time will be spent listening to unskippable dialog, pixel hunting or trying random combinations of items. Anybody who has tried a Telltale Games adventure game, or anything as modern as Fahrenheit or Heavy Rain, will find Overclocked more frustrating than fun.","October 31, 2015","false","7.3"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","11","26","0","0"
