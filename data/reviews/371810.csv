No goal! ONLY A LOT OF BUGS!\n\nThe game does not have any sounds AT ALL! I'm not joking! Only one ambient music in the main menu.\nAlso the main menu is terrible. Half of the buttons aren't working! Saving system isn't working too! The resolution and other settings are not saving. You cannot change the brightness. You can not change mouse sensitivity!\nAlso you need to exit the game completely in order to change something in the settings...and this is really annoying.\n\nThis parody on a game not worth 6$. Do not buy this!","June 8, 2015","false","0.2"," 92 of 107 people (86%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","86","92","107","7","1"

Dreaming still only has it's prologue available right now, but the next chapter is on the way as I write this.\n\nOverall the game's atmosphere helps enourage you to try to find out what's going on, though for now it's too short to really get you invested. I'm switching to a positive recommendation because of the significant improvement and responsiveness of the devs, though I still think perhaps waiting and keeping an eye out for now, just because of how short the available material is.\n\n[END NEW NEW INFORMATION]\n\nBlind First Impression Video; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c2WoTcSAg1A\n\nFollow up to my First Impressions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGZWnNQdIkc\n\n[OLD NEW INFORMATION] The Devs have responded to complaints saying they will have a quick response to the issues, and believe they can quickly make the game more what they wanted on release. I personally suggest waiting, and not writing this game off just yet. [END OLD NEW INFORMATION]\n\nShort version though: This should be early access at best, still in testing at worst. This game is missing pieces and seems to react randomly at times. It has a very mysterious asthetic, but it's difficult to move at times due to impossible obsticals caused by bugs, not puzzles.","June 8, 2015","true","1.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","9","14","0","0"

You can even find this on Steam Forum, Do Not buy this game unless you have extra money to spend. If you bought it, you can consider using Steam Refund shortly after if you encounter problems same as mine.","June 18, 2015","false","0.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
