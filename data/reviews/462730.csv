Thats what this is - a small town building game with basic management principles and little micromanagement. Good for taking a break from large, high end games and returning to a simpler play style.\n\nPros:\n- Small file size\n- Simple to get the hang of\n- Mildly entertaining, it reminds me of those countless city-building games you get on smartphones.\n- I like the objectives system for each area\n- Cheap\n\nCons:\n- Does seem to hold your hand a bit, though i haven't done too much of the story yet (will update as necessary)\n- A little sparse. What content there is isn't lacking, but it feels like there could be much, much more.\n\nOpinion:\nGood for killing time, if time is thirty minutes to an hour. This may well be different for everyone else, but i can't see myself playing for much more than that in one sitting. Worth getting, but not worth paying much more than £3.00 for (I purchased on sale for £2.09)\n\n5/10","April 27","true","0.6"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","22","29","0","0"

Campaign Mode tends to hand hold so it's not challenging but still enjoyable (think DinerDash style, objective vs clock). 'Sandbox Mode' is also available, can create custom scenarios by changing timers and mission objectives. For the price it's worth a look at, should provide an evening or two of fun.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yYEvJbank0&index=1&list=PLslfvIJAupswCGNHR9f7hl9xPcmCy9jsj\n(the elevator music can be turned down or completely disabled, it's separate from SFX)","April 27","true","1.4"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","34","53","3","0"

This one is very irritating, because the authors consciously made it into a clickfest: if you have 10 or more houses, any given monent one of them breaks and needs a manual repair. It looks like a sophomore exercise in commercial game-writing, with the same irritating commercial stylistics as found in online games in air flights. The target audience is not causal gamers, but some rich guy who thinks this kind of drivel must be popular with gamers. Uniquely bad game, I am quite ashamed I have it in my library. Please don't buy it. Thanks.","May 3","false","1.8"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","13","21","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daveferret/recommended/462730/","daveferret","ferret","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daveferret/","1899 products in account","Genre of casual games has long enjoyed popularity, but until recently avoided Steam. Now its number constantly raises and being relatively popular, distributors do not hesitate to re-release older titles too. Townopolis, originally from 2008, by Slovak team Lonely Troops is a good example, how to do it right.\n\nTownopolis is a casual strategy game that does not set any high goals in terms of sophisticated strategic options, but only for basic entertainment. If you are one of those people who like to build & build, modernise or even demolish, then this game is for you. This game will take you on activities in all mentioned directions. Everything revolves constantly around buildings. Games starts with just the basic types of buildings and then gradually add other options of structures and stuff.\n\nIn each of the 24 levels in total you have to focus on different aspects of building. Sometimes you have to pay attention to high number of inhabitants, sometimes their satisfaction or high earnings of your developer. During construction you need to improve buildings and equipment, purchase of materials and licenses for building features and of course hire workers.\n\nInitially, it is possible to build on already cleared area, but soon you’ll need to find a place for yourself, cutting down forests first, clear old abandoned houses and useless buildings etc. Each advanced structures, like the post office or supermarket requires a license. They tend to be quite expensive and you need to have built many high earning houses to afford it. Each building can be upgraded by star rating. The more stars, the more money. Satisfaction of your inhabitants is expressed by yellow smiley and angry ones by red smiley. Dissatisfaction can be reversed by building up structures in the vicinity or by fulfilling people’s needs.\n\nThe first few levels are just a tutorial where you learn the basic principles and mechanisms of game and you’re told what to do. Then you have to decide for yourself what will be the development strategy to accomplish all objectives in the desired limit to get gold star and trophy for each level. I needed to replay a few levels to get all achievements.\n\nGraphics corresponds to the genre and its time, but it’s still enjoyable in comparison to some newer games. The game can be played comfortably in the window and the background music is nicely flowing during play. It’s nice to see Steam Cloud feature too.\n\nOverall, the game can be recommended to every fan of casual strategies and casual players in general.\n\nThis review is part of the Steamified Community Review program.

It's pretty fun in short one hour bursts. Would have been nice to have a much larger space to build my city in Sandbox mode though. A bit too limiting in that regard. It would be a great game for young children to play to introduce them to city building games. Once they master this game get them to try Sim City 2000 :)","April 29","true","1.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It reminds me of a game called "Build-A-Lot", and it plays almost the same exact way.  I dunno if its a rip-off of that game or not, I do not care really, as this game is fun to play when bored, and its the best investment of a game I have gotten.  It was worth it, Buy this game if you like casual building.\n\nSomeone wrote on here in another posts rating it bad and comparing it to SimCity... this is nothing like SimCity as the population does not go any higher than 1500, and SimCity you could have a population of 500,000 plus bigger maps.  This is a different game type than SimCity, and is more of a planning zones and placing the proper buildings in the proper places to make them happy.\n\nI like playing the sandbox game and setting my own goals, its fun to reach those goals and feel accomplished everytime I finished them.  The game has replayablility, and I keep coming back to play when I have time and not playing another game, or if I need a break from other games.  It gives me something to do to kill the time with.","May 5","true","10.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Build a neighborhood with plenty of houses, and keep your residents happy by providing all services they need to make you a tidy profit.
