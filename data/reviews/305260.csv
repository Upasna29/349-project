Unlike alot of Facebook games this DOESN'T have an energy bar, what it does have is gems (or gold in this case) that can be used to speed up construction of buildings or recruitment of soldiers, this currency is rewarded for free from achivements and leveling up. While gold can't be used to buy and premium troops (who would have boosted stats), whoever buys the most gold will have the highest level and more troops to use repeatedly, so its P2W.\n\nIn the settings there are three choices (count them 3!), Music on/off, Sound Effects on/off, and Connect to Facebook so you can play with your friends because using the Steam friend sytem would be to difficult to use.... -_-\n\nGameplay- Exactly like Clash of Clans, boring, and meant for mobile games.\n\nMy final rating- 1/10, the 1 for not having an energy bar, if it had an energy bar I would just uninstall Steam completely, everything in game can be gotten for free but the ones who drops $100's will be on top of the leaderboards, this game should of stayed on mobile/Facebook and never brought to Steam.\n\nDo steam a favor and not give this game any cash, because if you do, MORE Facebook games will come to Steam trying to get the same kind of money out of you people.","August 6, 2014","false","0.4"," 1,306 of 1,472 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","306","1","0","26"

I am getting sick and tired of seeing these Mobile-To-PC ports showing up on Steam. The developers were so lazy that they didn't even change some of the words, because there are still words like "Tap" instead of "Click". This is literally just a mobile game, with MAYBE better graphics. I wouldn't know that though since you can't adjust any of the graphics. It has all of the micro-transaction as a regular mobile game, too. And I hope you like not seeing the bottom part of the game, because since there is no way of changing the resolution, the game gets cut off by your tool-bar. Don't even waste your time with this game. It's horrendous.","August 6, 2014","false","0.1"," 523 of 591 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","523","591","0","14"

This game was originally made for Mobile phones however they have done nothing to improve the game or even change the game by adding additional features as the Windows, Linux or MAC are many times more powerful machines than a mobile phone...\n\nIn my honest opinion you should not download this game as its a point and click game that has very small features, making you wait for hours upon completion of building and the game itself has very simple strategy mechanics that are totally boring. However this game does suit people who like clicking based games as this game introduces simple tycoon mechanics and more of a casual game-play.\n\nThe storyline for this game needs work as they are not narrated and are very basic text. The main animations and sound of the game also needs improvement as they are not very appealing for PC users, the whole game has been recoded to work on the computer but no extra features have been added! Not even graphical improvements, no improvements on the whole story and the strategy side of this game is appalling.\n\nThank you for the game but I do not recommend it.","August 6, 2014","false","0.2"," 420 of 477 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","420","477","0","0"

It’s a little too familiar to truly warrant much excitement but those keen for a World War 2 themed title will find more enjoyment.\n\nSet in 1942, players control a platoon of soldiers as they attempt to establish bases on various tropical islands in the South Pacific. While the theme is slightly different from the norm, the gameplay remains much the same.\n\nA brief tutorial guides one through the basics, which mostly relate to placing buildings and training troops. A barrier keeps players protected from enemy attack for a few days in order to give them a chance to be more established, but this is easily circumvented by the bloodthirsty. Once the tutorial is out of the way, structure is offered through a series of challenges that can be completed with the bonus being that they offer up gold bricks.\n\nGold bricks are essential here given that they’re the premium currency that affects how quickly projects are completed, among other things. While Battle Islands might seem initially generous with the gold bricks, they vanish quite quickly – leaving one quite restricted due to the plethora of timers.\n\nWaiting around for various tasks to complete will be a regular part of one’s sessions with Battle Islands. It’s really quite slow going. Competing with opposing players is briefly fun, but it’s nothing new for the genre and plays it very safe.\n\nIt’s the theme that makes Battle Islands slightly more noticeable, with the World War 2 theme often proving more endearing than something fantastical. That’s sufficient for a brief play session but I’d be surprised if anyone found the game truly gripping for any length of time. It’s not that it does anything particularly badly, it’s just all too familiar.\n\n\nGraphics / Sound Rating: ★★★½☆\nGameplay Rating: ★★½☆☆\nPlaytime Rating: ★★½☆☆\nReplay Value Rating: ★★★☆☆\n\nOverall Rating: ★★★☆☆","August 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 184 of 217 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","184","217","0","0"

Ultimately though it is a giant time sink with insane times to upgrade and ultimately will require money to get anywhere. It's a lot like Boom Beach but with way less balance and is ultimately ruined once you reach higher levels. Also the top 100 board is almost all bots. This is completely ignored by the creators and the more time goes on the more I think the bots belong to the people who actually made the game in an attempt to make it artificially competitive though they will never aknowledge many of the top 100 alliances are bots. You can look at individual players and one alliance has twice the listed dog tags (victory points) than all the players added togther. It's one thing to have the game be set up so that it ultimately requires money, it's another to try to absolutely deceive the player about the game to obtain it.\n\nMore Cons: The game is ultimately broken on so many levels. One major flaw that they have never fixed is the fact that when your troops land they very often will get stuck in spots and run in circles or just stop moving all together. You can't control the troops after they land (unlike Boom Beach) so there is nothing you can do. You also can be raided by any level and most high level people will because it's a very cheap and efficient way to build vicotory points to raise your ranking. When teams start to figure out which alliances are bots that are artificially propped up the admins just add additional dog tags to them as a team total (that doesn't match the individual player totals)  and the cycle continues.\n\nRecap: The game is super bugged. MUST spend money after a certain point. The developers deceive the players with tons of fake accounts (they seem to be almost half of all players), the game constantly crashes. If you check it out and like the concept, play the game this rips off and download Boom Beach on iOS or other platform for a fair and balanced free to play game.","March 22, 2015","false","98.1"," 77 of 87 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","77","87","6","0"

Trust me, this is not an RTS. If anyone is familiar with the game Clash of Clans, we can all say that its not an RTS. This game is very much based off similar mechanics as CoC, timeconsuming, pay to get things faster etc. A RTS is when you build up your base and manage recources in a REAL TIME (current time) strategy game. Which means managing units, where the units go, managing buildings and how to defend them etc. This game offers no such thing as RTS. You go into a battle, you spawn your units, after they are spawned you have no control over them WHATSOEVER. This is not RTS.\n\nThe mobile verison is great and all, I actually love the mobile verison, but right off the bat I saw when I moved the camera, the game rendered wierdly and did some crazy fps drops.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/recommended/305260/","gog-protoss","Protoss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gog-protoss/","4009 products in account","The "gameplay" mostly consists of waiting. This wouldn't be so bad if there weren't two annoying things:\n\nYou can be attacked. I don't know what happens if you lose but at least you will lose resources and probably defensive troops.\nYou need to check back too often. If it was designed as a game where you check back once or twice a day, it would be okay to mostly wait. Unfortunately in the early stages resources fill too fast in production buildings, and things get expensive quickly, so you need to check back every few hours to not waste resources, especially in the oil rig that produces 1300 and holds 2500 at level 2 on which you'll be for a few days.\n\nObviously I can't say how the late game will play out, but currently I see it as a way to get achievements easily every few days, instead of a real game. If you don't go for achievements, you will want to avoid this. But ok, below is a short review.\n\n\nWhat is Battle Islands?\n\nBattle Islands is a F2P-style base builder in isometric perspective. It is completely controlled with the mouse. The graphics are  as seen in the screenshots on the store page. The sound is nice but in style with the game heroic and military. You build a base on an island, or later several islands of which your first one always is the biggest, so the base won't grow too much. There also are water buildings, adding a bit to the depth. The game has PvP which can be turned off only for a short time with real money currency (gold bars) paid items. Gold bars are also acquired for achievements and very few sometimes at a daily spin. This will allow you to realistically get three buildings or upgrades built at the same time later, however they will take several days or maybe even longer to upgrade. You can promote units to make them stronger, the cost increase for them that comes with it won't matter much.\n\nThere is a campaign against the AI, consisting of 30 missions. Lost units won't be regained, but also surviving units won't return to your base, forcing you to rebuild every unit you send. Units take a moderate time to produce, I'm not sure if they take longer later.\n\nThe best thing about the game is that you get achievements essentially for doing nothing but waiting and upgrading your base... if you're not robbed in PvP...\n\nProducing ingame resources goes fast, but later upgrades cost a ton of resources, accumulating to already several days of production even with fully upgraded buildings. For that reason, it might be best to upgrade the command bunker and resource productions and possibly defenses first and invest not much in offensive, but this would need testing.\n\nRecommended: Only for achievement hunters","August 13, 2014","false","21.7"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","21","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/recommended/305260/","espresso651","Espresso","http://steamcommunity.com/id/espresso651/","281 products in account","In Sum: A dull Facebook game that is unbearably slow without microtransactions, and suffers from apparent controversy by the dev.  It just isn't fun.  0/5\n\n-----\n\nThis is basically a Facebook game on Steam.  And it brings with it the failings of a Facebook game.\n\nThe biggest issue in design, as far as I'm concerned, is the time.  This is not a game that you sit down and play.  You do an action, then have to wait hours, sometimes, days, for it to happen.  The game uses real time for this.\n\nGames such as this are not designed for fun or competition.  They are made for compulsion.  And that is the psychological strategy of this game.  You can build or upgrade something and wait from 10 minutes to 24 hours (maybe longer), or you can whip out the credit card and do it instantly.  The design of the game isn't necessarily "pay-to-win", but rather to make not paying so annoying and frustrating, that you pay repeatedly just to find the enjoyable game in here.  Meanwhile, those who do pay can progress essentially without limits, as every aspect of the game can be instant with purchasing.  To be fair, it is possible to play this game for free.  If you only play sporadically and are willing to progress painfully slow.\n\nI realize this is common practice in mobile games, but it is out of place on Steam.\n\nComing from a number of strategy games before playing this, I found the soldier's actions to be irritating to watch, due to the stupidity.  Sometimes you see them actually do something intelligent, like stopping just outside of howitzer range but in general, attacking troops will run into danger, then proceed to attack buildings while being fired on.  They also will try to group together in a clump, which makes them easily killed as a group.  Due to the slow progression, it is probable that defenses will develop faster than attack power, which causes a sudden bottleneck in progress...unless the credit card comes out.\n\nOverall after playing a few hours, I have to say, I'm not having fun.  I don't feel this was a particular good waste of my time.  I don't feel I have much in the way of positive feedback, because the issue is ultimately the design of the game.  It is truly a casual game in every sense, that not only is it meant for people who only check in every so often, but it requires you to approach it casually.  As for the game, it's not broken, it's just not fun.\n\nI have some concerns as well, about the developer's reputed actions on the community hub.  Apparently, criticisms about the game are being deleted, critics of the game are being banned, and recently a dubious set of community rules was posted on the forum superceding Steam's rules that, along with reasonable prohibitions (which were already against Steam's rules), states that "spreading misinformation" will result in a ban.  This could reasonably be construed as any information contrary to the developer's statements, which would include criticism.  Adding this clause lends credence to the reputation this game has been developing.","August 10, 2014","false","6.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

The game mechanics is strange - it generates the need to purchase units in the various objects which manifests itself, of course it follows with need to click on each building separately...etc.  Despite winning the battle yur spared units are lost and you need to train them again... :(  The game is very simple. Thats becouse its cross-platform shared title. I think it can be played even by a monkey or a chicken. Moreover, our units on the battlefield behave idiotically which combined with Imited time for the battle, results in the great unknown at the end.

Now I could make a decision because of DR Studios.\nPositive:\nThe design of the game elements is good\nEven if this game is a P2W title you can get everything without spending gold, you just need time (but a lot of ;) ). There are a few possibilities to get gold without spending money for it\nI haven’t found annoying bugs in the game, more in point negativeNegative:\nYou cannot say in this game is tactic. It is the simple concept mass wins, most of the time the time is the thing which saves you from more damage especially on the early levels. Later you can also\nWin battles with your defending. The balancing isn’t really good, many battle ships can be the dead to every island only the Gun Turret has a chance against them. The tactic is place first tanks and behind them\nTroops\nPermanent disconnects after end of fights. Sometimes I haven’t got the loot of a fight because of the failing synchronizing with the server.\nWhat strengthened my decision were the recent server problems. Server problems can always happen but it can’t be that you lose your save game, in which you put a lot of effort and time, because of that.\nDear developers why you can’t do it like it is in steam, make a local save game and a server save game so that you have a save game even the server crashes. Yes I know they have a support for this problem but it is now\nNearly a week since I have contacted them.Conclusion: You can definitely try this game because it is free to play but you shouldn’t spend money for it because the system is unsafe and there aren’t new inventions.\n\n\nich habe lange überlegt ob ich das Spiel empfehle oder nicht. Nun allerdings konnte ich dank DR Studios eine Entscheidung treffen.\npositiv:\ndas Design der Spielelemente ist gut gestaltet\nobwohl das Spiel P2W ist kann man alles mit Zeit erreichen. Es gibt auch Möglichkeiten Gold zu bekommen ohne es zu kaufen.\nBugs die das Spiel ausbremsen habe ich nicht gefunden, weiteres im Punkt negativnegativ:\nTaktik kann man das nicht nennen. Es funktioniert nach dem simplen Prinzip Masse gewinnt, denn meistens wird man nur von der Zeit vor größerem Schaden bewahrt besonders am Anfang, wenn man seine Insel\nnoch nicht so gut aufgerüstet hat. Später kann man dann auch mit den Verteidigungen so manche Schlacht gewinnen. Allerdings ist das balancing noch nicht wirklich ausgereift, so sind Schlachtschiffe in\ngroßer Anzahl der Tod für jede Insel, diese können nur effektiv von der Gun Turret ausgeschaltet werden. Das bisschen Taktik beschränkt sich stark auf die richtige Wahl der Truppen erst Panzer dahinter\nInfanterie.\nständige Verbindungsabbrüche nach Kampfende. So war es zumindest bei mir nach einem erfolgreichen Sieg gibt es nichts nervigeres als wenn das gesammelte Lot nicht angerechnet bekommt, da die\nSynchronisation mit dem Server fehlgeschlagen ist.\nWas mich jetzt allerdings endgültig zu meinem Entschluss bewegt hat waren die kürzlichen Server Probleme. An und für sich können Technische Probleme immer auftreten, allerdings kann es nicht sein\ndas man seinen Spielstand dadurch verliert in den man viel Zeit und vielleicht auch Geld gesteckt hat. Liebe Entwickler macht das doch einfach wie Steam es wird einmal lokal gespeichert und einmal\nServerseitig, dann hat man wenigstens noch seinen Spielstand lokal und muss nicht wie ich wieder von Level 1 anfangen (davor 49). Es gibt zwar einen Support der sich um dieses Problem kümmert, es ist\njedoch schon 1 Woche her das ich diesen kontaktiert habe und noch keine Rückmeldung bekommen habe.Fazit: Man kann das Spiel definitiv ausprobieren da es free to play ist verliert man dabei nichts, allerdings würde ich kein Geld investieren, da das System zu unsicher ist und es keine neuen Innovationen\ngibt.","May 19","false","135.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

I could not care less about micro-transactions but it really just comes down to the game being boring, which it is.\n\n\nSoooooooooooooooooooooooo boring. Don't get this game.

The 4th engineer costs ..... : 1000 GOLD\nBank : 132\n868 gold to go\nThe hard way(?): forget it ! there are not enough achievements + level to reach the 4th engineer without paying\nThe easy way    :  >>>>>>   pay  <<<<<<\n\nIn conclusion:\nthe more money you have to spend on this little piece of art the more skill you obvious have while having all engineers (max 5) unlocked.\nWhy is an engineer so important? Building and upgrading buildings takes hours days to complete and having 5 engineers work on your island at the same time increases your growth tremendously.\nBut it's O.K.A.Y.! If you want to "compete" in this "game" you can "play" and "support" the "dev" of this "game" by paying real money for "gold" go right ahead and be one of the cool kids.\n\nFor everyone else there is : Warframe , Dota 2 , Team Fortress 2 , Path of Exile  and many many more REAL F2P GAMES!","August 10, 2014","false","81.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

Planes are such a good mechanism for defense that i have never defeated anyone i attacked who had planes to defend. the AI just does what it wants. And that's a major problem, the AI.. Your units will move to the nearest building and attack it, even if getting in range of that building requires the unit to move around walls, and even if they are getting attacked by turrets while moving to the location.\n\nOnce i even had tanks move back and fourth infinitely untill time ran out and i lost.\n\nI sure hope nobody buys gold for this game to get engineers either, because you'll struggle to keep them occupied and you'll have to attack 5-6 times a day to keep them busy (for me training my units back after a battle takes 50min).\n\nMines are extremely overpowered, too, and can one-hit kill any land based unit. Though, i've rarely seen other players use it.\n\nIn general though, This game might seem like a good timewaster, playing it a couple of times a day, but you'd be better off elsewhere, just watch videos on youtube or something. This game has bugs, is unbalanced, without developer activity on the forums and has no real "endgame" that is worth getting to.

This game is a mobile game. The game wants you to connect to Facebook. Like many mobile games that try to get you to connect to Facebook, is plagued by the need to constantly pay to speed up building/upgrading process. That means that all of the game's mechanics are build around the idea of being as tedious and bothersome as possible to try to get some money. Of course many players will stop playing as soon as they realize what the game is all about but that's okay because these kind of developers are not interested in entertainment, they just want to get money. So if you don't want to pay, you are not the target of this game.\nIt's almost impossible to recommend this game even to people that enjoy these kind of mechanics, because most of them probably have already "invested" in another game like this one, and considering this game has nothing new to offer, they won't be interested in playing the same game they are playing but with different graphics.\n\n","August 8, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Right? Am I right? No? You mean the real reason is to play awesome games like League Of Legends, Age Of Empires, Just Cause 2, the supirior version of Portal 2, Half Life 2 and Team Fortress 2? Well, then I guess you should'nt download Battle Islands. Honestly Battle Islands was a game that could have been great if it took the approach of combining RTS elements from Age of Empires (The Original) and combined it with the whole Clash of Clans system. What I'm saying is that if you were able to build your Island without being tied down by the horrorable system that defines Facebook games (BUY STUFF TO DO STUFF FASTER ;D) and were then able to invade the island of another player that IS NOT OFFLINE, then it would be BETTER.  Think of it like the RTS version of Ascend: Hand of Kul, were you have your own territory that cannot be attacked or invaded while offline but can be attacked by other players through sending enemies into your world. Now imagine its you sending you units that you trained with resources THAT ARE NOT GAINED THROUGH SITTING THERE FOR AN HOUR WAITING FOR AN AMOUNT OF RESOURCES WORTH A DAMN TO COLLECT, but are instead gathered like in ge of Empires and then sending them to the enemies island while maintaining the ability to CONTROL YOUR UNITS so that the gameplay is more than watching your men commit suicide on enemy turrets when they should be attacking the resources which are ungaurded. Then the game would be awesome. But its not. Its a PC version of Clash Of Clans and Backyard Monsters. By the way there is no fullscreen so prepare for the wonderful world of window mode! yay! cheers!

I found it fun until I had a connection issue the has yet to be resolved. It's definitely a browser style game, so limit your expectations. Those saying it is pay to win are incorrect. I got up to level 15 with many victories and many base improvements without ever putting a dime into it. It all comes down to how you play. The only reason to spend gold is because you don't want to wait for a building/training/promotion timer to finish. Even then, you start with a good deal of premium currency, and can earn more by accomplishing in game achievements. Anyway, I'd still be playing this if I could get it to connect. Because of that unresolved issue, I can't currently reccomend the game, but will definitely change to a positive recommendation if/when it gets fixed.","August 10, 2014","false","32.6"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

It is for those people who want to play clash of clans but have guns instead of bows and arrows. While i doubt i would have even thought about getting this game if it cost money, having a free, 5 minutes session game that can get very competitive with steam friends is actually quite fun. Its great to cool down off after a long gaming session and since it is so quick to start up you can start opening a new game and play this to fill the time waiting for it to load. I would reccomend this game, but only really if you and a few friends get it together and I would warn you all to not assume its a bad clone of clash of clans, rather its clash of clanes hundreds of years in the future (in the game i mean)","August 31, 2014","true","30.3"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Pretty good, I like that it doesn't lag on my computer and it's pretty fun to play. The gampley itself makes you want to play more! You can build stuff, you can upgrade stuff, you can destroy stuff! This game is a real time strategy game. Sooo maybe when you're offline you'll get ♥♥♥♥ed up wich is pretty annoying..... BUT GUESS WHAT? You can buy a camoflauge it costs gold though. This game those have microtransactions. But you can get the gold for free aswell it's just harder! But if you attach someone while you have a camoflauge on your camo ends. STRAIGHT AWAY!

The game itself if okay, but still requires work.  When I first started there were a lot more supplies to be had, now there is really no way to save enough to upgrade defences further.  Example: I'm at level 65 with 2400 dog tags; I can only find around 200,000 supplies in an average battle (and even this takes a lot of searching), but it costs me 130,000 to deploy a full army, meaning I only net an average of 70,000 per battle, but need 3,200,000 to upgrade the hangar...  If that's not bad enough; as soon as I save up 1,000,000 someone at level 120 with 2800 dog tags will come and take half.  Because they take more than I can possibly earn in battle, I will never be able to upgrade beyond my current state. Also, AI is terrible, half of the time my soldiers just pace back and forth in the same spot until time runs out and I lose what would have been a winable match.","August 12, 2014","true","0.2"," 3 of 12 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","3","12","0","0"

It can be a little challenging (ok, a lot) with all the bully commanders and tyrants out there pummeling your humble defenses and farming away your hard earned crates. But, that's one of the reasons to like the game - the challenge and strategy required to preserve your stockpile long enough to advance to the next level and achievement. It can be a little disturbing when your supplies get taken away, especially just prior to the implementation of upgrading your units and defenses. I'd whine and cry a little more if I wasn't guilty of doing that to others myself - after all, it's WAR! And even the mighty lion and the fastest cheetah go for the weakest prey. Why fight someone your own size to risk great loss when you can pound a lesser army and take all the booty you want. Ever hear of Sun Tzu? It's a great game, loads fast, functional and free to play, The developers are happy to sell you gold at a fairly reasonable cost which can be used to purchase massive amounts of supplies. . .but where's the fun it that? Only a weak-minded, cowardly, punk-axx, spend-thrift little sissy/bully would need to do that. Also, it can be very helpful if you have the availability to log on for a couple minutes about every hour or so, but you can also go days and weeks without doing so and still find yourself in pretty good shape since no one can actually permanently destroy your base - you just lose crates and dog tags. Give it a try, it's cool. And, you can also draw really cool pictures of the islands and units in a makeshift birthday card to your girlfriend when you forget about her, add a quick rhyme and a clever poem about your gameplay and how it in no way compares to all her talent and beauty, and then she'll love you even more and appreciate all your efforts in the game while she's making dinner and cleaning up around the house. (She's smacking me in the back of the head right now - I gotta go) Play the game.","November 12, 2014","true","71.0"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

The game is blatantly "pay to win" by nature, while not completely limiting free players, it gives paying players a large advantage when it comes to base building and unit production. I dont automatically discount Battle Islands because of these facts though, as they show more of the nature of the mobile and social gaming industry than they display how poor the game is. I think Battle Islands is a decent game on the mobile/ social standard but it does leave much to be desired when it comes to a PC game.\n\nOverall I hope mobile and social gaming will hit a point where the start to realize you can have a good game without making pay to win shortcuts, but I doubt this will happen if people still make there crappy in game purchases. So in the end all I can say is give Battle Islands a try, just try not to pay real money for anything.","August 7, 2014","true","3.3"," 24 of 67 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","24","67","0","2"

You can play alone through the campaign mode, or with others in the Alliance/Rival mode, or just in one-off attacks against other players. The developers have kept it so battles are reasonably well matched in the one-off mode.

I will say that I prefer CoC over this; but this is a fun game to play on the computer if you are bored. I haven't played much of it so far, but from what I can tell, it has it's own little differences from CoC. People are saying it's a pay-to-win type of game when really I see that it just takes a little more work than it does in CoC. A lot of games like these, battle beach, CoC, boom beach, castle clash, have players that do pay real money to help upgrade faster. But that doesn't mean you can't have fun and you can't be good at these types of games. I give this game an 8/10 just for another strategy/run+gun type of game.\n\nIf you're happy with any other game that's like this, and don't want to get involved on another, don't worry about it. But if you want another to play, I'd give this one a shot. If you don't like it, don't play it; if you do, great. Don't give this game a bad review because your opinion on it is bad. Someone else could like it and love it when you don't. Give it a try and if you don't like it, it's about 10-30mins out of your life.","August 6, 2014","true","352.3"," 3 of 34 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","3","34","0","0"

The players  whom have the best offensive and defensive strategy rise quickly via upgrades, promotions and joint battle operations.\n\nIf you don't like waiting you have the option to buy gold bricks which allow you to avoid long waiting periods associated with crafting your offensive and defensive measures in order to engage in more intense battles. Gold is rewarded to all players after their meter reaches 100% and they move on to the next level so this is completely optional.\n\nThe game gets better as you progress and build a stronger military to handle both offensive and defensive measures.

This will allow you to team up against stronger rivals whom will grant you many more rewards if you are successful on the battlefield.\n\nThere are some frustrating issues with the games like tanks ignoring enemy fire even though you send in 5 tanks to handle business in the general area. Another issue is bunker soldiers shooting through buildings and destroying tanks and soldiers that are clearly at a safe distance behind a fortified wall ect ..\n\nThe artificial intelligence could be a bit better but overall it's still a fun game to play overtime.","November 13, 2014","true","67.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is very apparent from the tutorial where it shows you that you must build a barracks, which will take a minute, but if you spend gold, you can have it now! Gold is the premium currency you pay money for. This is a silly, pay to win time management game not so different from what one finds on Facebook. In my opinion, "free to play" pay to win time management games with very little production value have no place on Steam. I would not recommend this game to anyone, as it is merely engineered to make you want to spend money while offering almost no real value.","November 14, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You construct and maintain your islands and army, you raid other players bases, and run through the campaign, which at some points, others up a bit of a challenge. Seems like a blast right? IT IS! But then reality sets in. You get build times of 10 days just so you can hold more resources to wait another 10 days to spend. Training times for troops aren't too bad at first, 20 second, 45 second, but then you have some that are an hour, which kills the whole 'quick retraining' thing. I see what the Devs want, which is for you to spend money to build stuff quicker, but the amount of money you would have to spend to make any difference at all is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nOver all, I feel like it is a good game, but due to the huge wait times and extreme depending on spending cash, I would not recommend this game.","August 18, 2014","false","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Supplies are too scarce. I've had to be idle for 5 minutes to get supplies enough to make a few troops and one mortar. Good tip for these game dev's is to keep this in mobile, fix the stupid AI, and easy the start diffuculty. But that only adresses so little. I've played it for a while and can't even begin to imagine how many bugs and glitches are in this. But I've spotted a few. Mortars stare straight at enemies and just stand there.

To begin with, you have to grind hours after hours to get something. Factories take wayyyyyy too long to give you supplies. But of course, this was meant to be on a mobile device.

Supplies are too scarce. I've had to be idle for 5 minutes to get supplies enough to make a few troops and one mortar. Good tip for these game dev's is to keep this in mobile, fix the stupid AI, and easy the start diffuculty. But that only adresses so little. I've played it for a while and can't even begin to imagine how many bugs and glitches are in this. But I've spotted a few. Mortars stare straight at enemies and just stand there.

You construct and maintain your islands and army, you raid other players bases, and run through the campaign, which at some points, others up a bit of a challenge. Seems like a blast right? IT IS! But then reality sets in. You get build times of 10 days just so you can hold more resources to wait another 10 days to spend. Training times for troops aren't too bad at first, 20 second, 45 second, but then you have some that are an hour, which kills the whole 'quick retraining' thing. I see what the Devs want, which is for you to spend money to build stuff quicker, but the amount of money you would have to spend to make any difference at all is absolutely ridiculous.\n\nOver all, I feel like it is a good game, but due to the huge wait times and extreme depending on spending cash, I would not recommend this game.","August 18, 2014","false","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I despise a lot of things about this game, however. Such as the following:\n\n1) It's p2w. You will see about a hundred pop-ups a day saying "Ohh buy this" or "Ohh buy that".\n2) It's a complete rip-off of Clash of Clans.\n3) You will get attacked. A LOT. I once got 100,000 resources from raiding people for countless hours, I logged off, did stuff, but then I turned it back on. "10 people attacked you."\nand 4) Most of the units are legit crap. I thought jeeps were good, they are not. Sure, they'll go for the resources, but they'll die before they even fire one bullet at it. The naval units are crap as well. Gunboats will are fragile and Battleships take up a huge amount of space. I can only train one of them. And they are SOOOOO SLOW.\n\nBut, there are things I kind of like about the game, such as:\n\n1) It doesn't cost any resources to attack people.\nand 2) There's some kind of wheel of fortune. Generally, you need gold to play it, but you can also get it free once a day for a chance of getting 4 gold bars.\n\nNot a lot of good things about the game, I can't say I'd recommend buying it. In my opinion: It's okay. It's easy in the lower levels, but as you progress, it's like you're slowly descending into the pits of hell.","April 26, 2015","false","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People dont seem to understand that it dosn't make it a copy of CoC  just because you have gems and you can build things and train troops.

PvP has no opt out by the looks of it and once your starter camo runs out 3 days after starting you are at the mercy of anyone. Someone on the thread complained of being ♥♥♥♥♥ at lvl7 by a lvl51. If you stuff up your island placements, the buildings can be moved at will but the island-addons cannot and there doesn't seem to be a reset/start over.\n\nPay for Play: everything not only doubles but the time to build does also, encouraging you to just hand over cash to speed it up again.\n\nNot recommended!","September 2, 2014","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is very apparent from the tutorial where it shows you that you must build a barracks, which will take a minute, but if you spend gold, you can have it now! Gold is the premium currency you pay money for. This is a silly, pay to win time management game not so different from what one finds on Facebook. In my opinion, "free to play" pay to win time management games with very little production value have no place on Steam. I would not recommend this game to anyone, as it is merely engineered to make you want to spend money while offering almost no real value.","November 14, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why couldn't they just store my game state normally on server?\n\nBtw withouth this bug (when I lose 2 days gaming) I could enjoy the game. It wouldn't be soo bad.
