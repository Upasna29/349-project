It's ok, I'll wait for you to do it.\n\nDone? Good, because this game currently has the best native support for VR available right now.  A perfectly realized virtual cockpit with great functionality and UI suited for VR.  The sense of immersion is quite spectacular, and the game itself is also very fun.\n\nFor those without a rift, the game is quite good as well.  It places you on the moon (or mars) in control of a lander type craft, in which you perform missions for experience and cash, with which you can upgrade your lander's capabilities.  The lander handles as a low gravity vehicle would handle, and with practise you can pull off some very impressive manouevers.  The types of missions available range from surveying certain locations, searching for misplaced or lost cargo and transportation of cargoes.\n\nThere is a multiplayer component as well, though I have to attest i haven't really played much of this mode (was having way too much fun in the single player portion of the game)\n\nOverall, I'd heartily recommend the game to anyone with a slight interest in space exploration - and if you have a Rift this is a must purchase.","November 25, 2013","true","9.4"," 84 of 90 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","84","90","0","0"

Takes a little while to get the hang of (there's some video tutorials included) but once you're flying around without any assists it's great fun.\n\nRadio chatter and some fitting background music add atmosphere to a lunar environment that would otherwise have none (zing!).  You will also have the opportunity to fly around a map on Mars where dust storms and increased gravity and drag make flying much more difficult.\n\nSome physics knowledge is definitely a bonus.  Physics nerds like myself will take pleasure in having to plan ahead, taking into account things like cargo weight, fuel efficiency, conservation of momentum and more.  You will feel like you've mastered lunar flight when you line up a trajectory for the landing pad, using your RCS thrusters to reduce your transverse speed while throttling up your main thruster to keep the vector over the pad, to finish with a quick yaw at the end to line up a perfect landing.\n\nProbably the biggest drawback to the game is the relative lack of mission variety with only three types.  The environments are of course pretty barren as you'd expect so like with many flight simulators you are more occupied with what your craft is doing and how it's flying.  This is where Lunar Flight really shines.\n\nIt supports TrackIR and Occulus Rift too so props to the developer!\n\nOverall recommended!","April 19, 2014","true","10.8"," 34 of 37 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","34","37","0","2"

It has a steep learning curve but is extremely satisfying to master.\n\nInitially it feels a bit like playing the classic 8 bit 'lunar lander' type games in 3D but there's more to it than that. Missions include carrying cargo between locations, gathering data from survey sites and recovering lost cargo.  As you progress with missions you gain XP and are able to upgrade your ship to make it more fuel efficient and more manoeuvrable.\n\nMultiplayer introduces combat, adding 'sidewinder' style missiles and decoy flares to the mix.  Combat isn't easy; changing direction can be hard due to inertia and it's a pretty unique experience.","December 8, 2014","true","132.3"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","0"

I own about every flight and space flight simulator there is, and I must admit, this game was quite a fun experience.\n\nFirst, you'll have to learn about thrust vectoring, which is about the hardest thing to learn if you don't know physics. It's very long for some people and you may get desperate and begin hating this game. But once this is done, you'll understand just how fun this game is.\n\nYou can carry out mission, such as locating lost equipment or transporting cargo. And yes, weight does affect your flight. There nothing more intense than landing on a platform with 0.3% left fuel because you underestiamted the weight of that cargo.\n\nAnd there's multiplayer : Shooting other people on the moon/mars!\n\nAnd the best part is : The developper (independant, as far as I know) oftens adds stuff to the game and they're awsome. When I bought the game, there were 3 maps, no multi. Since then, Mars was added, multi was added, Occulus Rift support was added and I can't wait to see what's next.\n\nA definitive buy for any flight sim enthousiast.","November 27, 2013","true","18.5"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Whether you are fending off incoming missiles or carrying out missions to grab randomly appearing space-crates of space-candy on the moon, firing missiles at your fellow astronauts', then this game gets it right.\n\nNo seriously though, it is not space-candy, it is high-tech space loot that you would not even understand.\n\nBored?

It may look boring or perhaps even overly complicated at first, but when you get the hang of the mechanics it becomes EXTREMELY enjoyable. I also gotta mention the nice high fidelity graphics, excellent performance and fantastic sound design. I don't know if its real LM radio chatter from the 70s but it sure sounds like it and makes the game really immersive.\n\nOverall its nothing short of awesome all around, my only grievance is that the dev doesn't want to make the oculus rift virtual 3D cockpit available without having the oculus, so you're forced to play with a 2D cockpit with windows and monitors to the 3D world. A real shame but besides that this is great and I strongly recommend it if you enjoy fun games.","February 12, 2014","true","11.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Yes, there is a learning curve here. One thing that is a bit unfair is a stock lander with no upgrades lacks a stabilizer, if you get the craft rotating in mutiple axis you will have a hell of a time getting it stabilized. As you progress and upgrade the LM you won't have this problem, though of course you will have more experience flying and won't be so fazed by basic flight. Bottom line: when starting out only use yaw/rotate and leave pitch and roll alone. Mission types are fine though they boil down to fly from base X to base/point X and do something. Lost cargo is a little more interesting as you have to use your eyes to locate the target (the beacon is too short ranged to be of too much use in locating the cargo). Some other mission types would be useful, like a photo-mapping mission, where you have to fly a designated strip of territory taking images as you go along.\n\nThe actual feeling of flight is superb. The Hills map in particular has a very authentic Lunar Highlands feel to it. Others less so. Canyons is challenging but the verticle exageration makes it look a little unbelievable. Mars is also a challenge but after the "purity" of Lunar flying is a bit frustrating.\n\nAs far as this game being too difficult, well, I disagree. If you watch the basic tutorials you should be fine, esp if you obey the basic rule of "no pitch/roll w/o a stabilizer". If you want difficult, try Eagle Lander 3D which is a hardcore LM sim, no game, no missiles, no HUD, just the DSKY and a scribed pattern on the LM window to guide you and historical Apollo scenarios.\n\nFor a niche title an impressive level of support. After the initial release we saw release of Oculus Rift support and then multiplayer, and continuing support into 2015. The developer has demonstrated maturity and staying power by supporting this very excellent sim/game.","September 22, 2015","true","16.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

I only wish I had an Oculus Rift to play it with, but my TrackIR does perfectly well.\n\nEver since "Lunar Lander" on the ZX81 and "Thrust" on the Atari ST, I've loved these kinds of gravity-based vector thrust games.  This game takes it into a whole new dimension: 3D.\n\nEverything about this game is delightful: the mini tech tree to upgrade the lander, the background sounds, the retro green UI, the perfect lunar landscape rendering.  I have to hand it to Shovsoft, this game is so polished you can see your face in it.\n\nThis game is for people who have EXCELLENT spacial awareness.  If you get a bit sea-sick, or can't read a map upside down, go elsewhere.   This is the sort of game where you have to be upside down, spinning, while flying in a parabolic arc, trying to calculate thrust vectors to slow you down and cancel rotation before you become a lunar smear.\n\nI absolutely love the sense of "being there", especially with the head-tracking, and in-ear microphones.  Sitting with the lights off, listening to the NASA commentary and carrying cargo around, I'm in hog heaven.\n\nI really REALLY hope that there's a sequel to this which goes in the direction that HardWar (or SubCulture) took.  Thank you shovsoft, I've loved every second of playing this!\n","June 28, 2014","true","13.3"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psiborg/recommended/208600/","Psiborg","Psiborg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psiborg/","205 products in account","This unassuming title delivers far more than you might expect on first glance and has become one of my all-time favourite games! Yes - it's that good!\n\nThe visuals and physics are superbly done giving you a real sense of low-G flight while keeping the controls very straight-forward. However, just because the simulation is limited to basic thruster controls, don't be fooled into thinking this is a simple arcade flight model.\n\nIt takes a while to master flight and get used to the fact that (unlike an aeroplane) the direction you're facing is not always the direction you're moving and that your primary thrust (assuming you're upright which frequenly you are not) is pushing you up rather than forward. Learning the art of flight and mastering precise landings is tons of fun and very addictive.\n\nIt's the *feeling* of low-G flight that this game does so incredibly well! I don't have an Occulus Rift yet but it supports it and I imagine it would be nothing short of incredible! After you finish a flight, you can optionally save it and play it back which is a great feature if you've done a particularly interesting manoeuver or perhaps recovered from a minor crash.\n\n*Note: I am a long standing PC gamer and get frustrated when the control scheme of a game is compromised to support gamepads that lack the precision of a mouse. However, Lunar Flight is a notable exception to that rule. This game is best played with a controller. A joystick/HOTAS setup works well (I've tried it) as it does with any flight simulator but in this case a gamepad is definitely the best option.\n\nThere are 3 lunar maps of increasing complexity and a 4th Mars map that has stronger gravity and wind storms which push you off course and obscure your vision adding a nice extra challenge.\n\nMissions are one of three varieties: Transporting cargo directly from one pad to another; surveying (hover over) an area; or searching for and returning cargo that has been lost somewhere on the surface. In addition there are time trials where you have to fly from pad to pad through a series of gates as fast as possible and you can equip missles to shoot at either unmanned drones or other players in multiplayer.\n\nPersonally, I find the magic to this game is in the flying - not the shooting - and I would have been just as happy if the combat had been removed from the game entirely. The time trials never grabbed me either as I prefer to fly at my own pace. The missions are fun but extremely simplistic. After 100+ hours in the game, I fly cargo recovery exclusively as it is the most interesting of the three.\n\nIn some ways the game suffers from it's sucessful flight model as it's so much fun that even once you're past the challenge of learning, you still want to keep flying around. But, the simple and limited missions mean that there just isn't enough to do.\n\nPROS:\n- Well executed and realistic flight/physics model.\n- Excellent sounds and graphics. Both are simple but very effective.\n- Wonderful *feel* to low-G flight.\n- Oculus Rift support (even though I don't have one to try yet).\n\nCONS:\n- Simplistic and limited missions that quickly become repetitive.\n- Relatively small maps. They're sufficient but would be nice if they were bigger.\n\nMastering flight can be a challenge at first. However, the realistic physics coupled with simple controls strike a nice balance between game and "light sim", making it easy to pick up.\n\nIt's the wonderful sensation of low-G flight keeps me coming back for quick fixes despite the repetitive missions. I highly recommend this game to anyone that has an interest in flight games.","January 5, 2015","true","128.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

No tweaking necessary, only minor customization for Xbox controls to suit your own preferences. Second, it rarely gives motion sickness, as long as you avoid spiraling out of control! This is the perfect game for people new to the Rift and should come bundled with the consumer version when it is out, IMHO. It is my go-to game to "get my Rift legs back" from a period of inactivity.\n\nThe physics are spot on. The Xbox 360 controls and in-cockpit controls/HUD are the best implementation I've seen. It takes a few tries but once you get the hang of them everything is intuitive, and it doesn't take long. But for the fact I am sitting in Earth's gravity, I would think I was actully flying around on the moon retrieving lost cargo. And shooting missiles at my competition in online multiplayer. It is a relaxing and serene experience.\n\nIf you have enough money to buy a Rift, you have enough money to buy this game. You owe it to yourself, the community, and the developer to give it a try! Otherwise, you are missing an out-of-this-world experience!\n\nI cannot give this "game" enough praise. It is more of an experience than a game!\n\nThe non-VR version is probably also good (and higher resolution) but the VR version is so good I don't want to stop.

Yes, there are four maps but thats a bit of an exaggeration. You have TWO maps, the Moon and Mars, with the Moon having three different sizes. Apart from that, they look EXACTLY the same. You can choose between missions, either delivering cargo or searching for some 'lost' item but that gets VERY samey very fast and you get points/cash and XP for completing each task. However, what for? As far as I can tell, the only way you can upgrade your craft is to make it able to carry more stuff, its not like there's a proper tech tree or even different craft to choose from.\n\nAs a simulation, it's not bad, its AWFUL. It kind of feels right when you first play it but it's not long before you realise youve been conned. For a start, you lift off, set a trajectory and cut your engine once you have the required velocity. Now, rotate your craft slightly, the thing will start to turn as if it was an atmospheric craft!!! Changing a space vehicle orientation does NOT affect it's path once the main engine has quit and even on Mars, where there is an atmosphere, you have no atmospheric control surfaces, so again, no difference would be felt. Also, WHY would it be considered realistic to have a Lunar type vehicle used to shuttle cargo on a planet with an atmosphere? Putting that aside, there is NOTHING else that you can call a simulation, no systems, no proper navigation, etc. It's just Up/Down, Left/Right, Yaw/Pitch. If you want a REAL simulation, look for a game called 'Orbiter'. It's been around for years and is pretty much a FULL simulation with very good recreations of proper systems and physics. There are tons of add-ons for it and you can fly anything from fictional futuristic craft to a very good representation of a PROPER Lunar Lander complete with the Saturn V launch system as well. Oh and there is no score, no achievements, no leaderboard, if you screw up your flight, you die, the end. The price? £0.00.\n\nNo, sorry, can't recommend, certainly not at the full £6.99 price. The only thing I can see this making it worth a try is if you have a VR device. On sale for a couple of quid? sure, give it a go but these days, you can buy alot better at this price and you certainly can't argue with the above example that is FREE.","October 22, 2015","false","2.3"," 26 of 46 people (57%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","57","26","46","4","0"

The creator seems to think it's more on the arcade-ish side, but I think the flight model is complex enough to make most people think "simulator". You will have to think about when and how to turn to gain right kind of velocity, when to start braking in time and other things like that. I would also recommending using an analog control of some kind. Keyboard is too clunky. Personally I'm using a joystick. I guess the most arcadey thing might be the missiles that were added later. Probably to make the multiplayer have some point. I just ignore that and fly around doing missions. Very relaxing. There's also a simple level up system for buying better thrust, gyros to kill your spin and such.\n\nIt had been said that this is one of the best early Oculus Rift games. I wouldn't know about that, but the virtual cockpit is enjoyable enough with just headrtracking (I'm using EDTracker with FreeTrack).","June 1, 2015","true","2.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The game is on the verge of being a simulator, which is both a blesssing and a curse: the game is highly realistic, thus bringing a great challenge; however, the controls are ridiculously complicated, and there is no built-in tutorial.\nThe missions are fun, but there are only three types and the game thus gets bland.\nThe game really shines in multiplayer deathmatch. Flying around, targeting friends, then taking them down is extremely entertaining, and brings hours of enjoyment.\nLunar Lander playtime is rather like smoked samon: while it isn't enjoyable in large quantities, small portions make it much more digestable.\nThe $9.99 price seems rather steep as a result, but if you buy the game, you get a 75% off coupon to give to friends. If you get the game in a sale for $4.99, then add on the coupon, the game is just around $1.25.

Playing with an xbox controller, headphones and TrackIR - I forgot I was at home and not in a little cargo carryin space mobile.  I've blown through multiple hours in a day, gliding over the moon (and mars) while listening to the wonderfully ambient soundtrack and the chatter from astronauts.\n\nMissions vary from Cargo hauling which involves cargos of various weights and require different techniques to manage your fuel properly, to Data Scanning and Lost Cargo missions where you need to explore in a general area to find a lost cargo container. There are also Time Trials, where you fly a predefined course from one base to another in as fast as time as possible.  I cannot speak for the multiplayer, I see no active servers.  I would be interrested in giving it a go though if I could find someone to play it with.\n\nAs you progress, you'll gain money and XP.  Use both to upgrade your little ship.  There's 4 components to upgrade, with 3 levels of upgrades for each module available.  First flight will be bad, but stick with it.  Once you learn the physics and techniques needed to fly and your brain associates all the HUD elements to what t he ship is doing, it becomes quite easy and you'll soon find yourself pulling advanced maneuvers while sailing over the moon.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you're interrested in actual space flight, or games like Kerbal Space Program.  You're going to need an hour or 2 of dedicated time to acclimate yourself to the controlls / feel of the ship but it's highly rewarding once you do.

The cockpit looks fantastic, there's a good sense of scale - nothing seems too big or too small - and interacting with all the cockpit buttons (instead of requiring the keyboard / having a floating hud full of buttons) works really well.\n\nAs for the game itself, the physics handles... well, like it should:  Gravity pulls you down, you've got your velocity vector to manage, and then there's the actual crafts rotation to consider - all under the no-air-resistance-because-we're-in-space environment where any force you apply you have to counteract yourself.  There's the additional problem of cargo (if you're doing transporting/finding lost cargo missions) - cargo adds weight to your craft, affecting the thrust-to-weight ratio and thus making the craft less manoeuvrable.\n\nThe sense of scale and depth that the Oculus Rift provides adds a whole new dimension (ha) to the game, which I feel likely makes it easier to fly your craft as you have a better grasp of where you are in the 3d-space, and it also of course makes the game a lot more immersive.

After several hours of practice you can become proficient in the basic flight skills which can lead to some further exploration of the various lunar bases, lunar surface, and your ability as a lunar pilot. The game keeps things interesting as the player can fly back and forth from various bases, accepting missions to deliver goods, exploring areas of the moon, or recovering lost items. You are paid for your efforts resulting in further upgrades, maps to unlock (including Mars), and various achievements. The game can be very challenging and offers its players variable environmen modifiers especially when on Mars.\n\nHighly recommended for those who enjoy flight simulations and/or space travel though I would strongly suggest preparing yourself by purchasing an applicable joystick of some type.","March 29","true","12.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

When the game graphics are optimised and the app stops crashing in Win 7 32 this game is fabulous. I am now running it windowed at 2560x1440 60Hz with no anti-aliasing, low settings except high terrain. I can now play hours on end without a single crash in 32bit.\n\nI have found the experience of undertaking missions on the moon/mars on my 27" monitor combined with the superbly appropriate audio track totally mesmerising... for space fans this is a truly awesome game. Can't wait till the developer makes a frosty Titan level DLC with Saturn shining in the sky. The lander would need to drill in the ice to recover appropriate samples for analysis. Or how about a DLC mercury lander that tries to stay in the shadows to avoid overheating? Keep it up. EDIT Dec 2015: This game was abandoned by its developer stating shorting of funds with no promise of further input!!! Well if you abandon a game so abruptly, you obviously wont attract more purchases. With only 4 levels to play, no DLC releases and mounting negative reviews, what does developer expect exactly? what a waste of developers effort. I have waited long enough hence the bitter ending to my review.","June 3, 2015","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You'll be amazed how fast you crash on your first flight, and your second, and your third, as you are having a good laugh, how even steering the freakin' module seems impossible to achieve!\n\nBut then the impossible becomes possible and you eventually manage to steer the module. Then, many crashes later, you become able to land it without crashing, sometimes even where you wanted it to land. But touch the roll controls - those arrow keys that your daddy had warned you never to touch - and you will soon go into an uncontrollable spin to a fiery doom!\n\nHours and days pass, and eventually you realize you are now able to steer the module so beautifully that it's amazing. Using the roll, getting out of spins and carrying heavy loads is not a problem for you.\n\nYes the learning curve was hard, but you will be amazed how fluid the piloting has become. Then you notice the landscapes are soothing and you realise how immersive the sound and music are.\n\nI love just playing this game to relax, fly around the moon and mars and play about with the controls. Yes, the types of missions are rather limited, but just flying the thing is a really smooth experience.\n\nRecommended for all kids age 9 to 99.","June 5, 2014","true","8.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Well, if you liked that, you might like this.\nIn this game you're in a Moon-lander, and you can do missions such as scouting, surveying and delivering. For this you'll gain "experience" and also money to buy upgrades with. This time, of course, it's in 3D. It feels very much like a simulator, you get very extensive controls (it's best to use something analogue, by the way). You might even have a lot of trouble getting used to the low gravity and slow response. But once you get the hang of it, it's quite fun and challenging. The graphics might be simplistic, but they're not bad and do the job. The audio could be better, but it also works.

Although it sounds interesting, after an hour or so it may start becoming a little boring and tiring. That's because the probe is extremely sensitive to the surroundings and controlling it is a little difficult (at least for me). As a result, it can become a little annoying.\nSo nope I don't recommend this game.\nKeep in mind though that this is just my opinion. I don't want to keep you from buying a game that may grant you many hours of enjoyment. So do a little more research before buying this (or any) game.","February 14, 2015","false","7.1"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

However, some months ago I had a brainwave and went back to configure it differently... Instead of assigning joystick to roll, pitch axis as you would a regular flight sim... I assigned the joystick x axis to thrust sideways left and right respectively. Joystick Y axis assigned to thrust forward and back. Throttle controls main engine for Y axis travel.  Thus with x52 pro I am able to maintain level flight and in addition the yaw is controlled by joystick yaw axis (twist of stick).\n\nI like this sim a lot.  I like the graphics... I like the non arcade nature and realism of flying moon or mars based missions to transport cargo or recover things.  Haven't tried multiplayer yet but I guess that will be fun since u have rockets and flares.\n\nI recently purchased Oculus DK2 and was amazed to find Lunar Flight is an incredible experience... Incredible because the developer of this sim has created an amazingly realistic experience through oculus.  You sit in your fully 3d cockpit and can control the instrument screens by looking at them and hitting activate button.  Everything is life size and in stereoscopic 3d with oculus and with Lunar Flight it just looks mind-blowing.\n\nI use runtime 6.0.1 and in direct mode for this sim.\n\nIf you own Oculus... buy Lunar Flight.  If you don't own Oculus.. Buy the CV1 when it launches in Q1 2016.","March 1, 2015","true","7.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

In Lunar Flight, the simulation is realistic, it respects the laws of Newton and it gives you the feeling of driving the real lander.\nIt takes time to get aquanted to the controls and the most difficult part perhaps is to get trained on yaw, pitch and roll, i.e. the real attitude. You can progress a lot without using YPR commands, but the most rewarding part comes when you manage those controls.\nThe graphic part is accurate: light, dust, shadows are just ok and on a recent PC it flows quite smoothly. The soundtrack is really good: it is an ambient track which fits the deepness of the moon environment, in which everithing else is silent. Always on audio, the flight controllers dialogues are a bit repetitive and once you got the main dialogue it's a bit boring hearing over and over.\nOk, I don't know if in a future in which the man could be on the Moon the best vehichle to use would be a Lander like the one in Lunar Flight,  which is almost the same of 1969-1973 Apollo Missions. Anyway, especially with the 3D environment, the simulation is really immersive. I also suppose that the Oculus Rift port will be amazing.\nConcerning single player, the major missions are  transport, cargo rescue and going from A->B. Some cargo rescue missions are quite difficult and be sure to have additional tank of fuel with you. Additional missions typology other than could be beneficial to the longevity. I personally don't care too much about multiplayer on this game.\nThe upgrade system is normal: make money with missions, upgrade tools and so on, but IMO it does not really drive the game/story.\nSomething I really miss is a Linux porting: I'd like to be able to play it also on that platform.\nIn synthesis, I definitely recommend this game if you are a passionate about astronautics and have the patience to learn how to control the lander, which is not immediate.","December 28, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Either way I'm finding the game is now better with a joypad over a keyboard. While you still need to keep your fingers near a keyboard, you can still manage to fly and land your craft with ease, something that used to take a lot of practice and skill.\n\nPurely for 3D aesthetics I'd highly recommend this game, if you have a 3D TV then take a look at the video above, if you don't then just enjoy it in 2D.\nIf you like a challenge then it's worth it for that alone.\n","December 8, 2014","true","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm a classic cabinet style arcade game junkie and I can still go into the arcade rooms and play that old 2D vector graphics game that had the player landing on moon ridges by controlling thrust and angle of your lunar module, all while watching your fuel diminish.  This game "Lunar Flight" takes that idea and converts over to 3D.\n\nThe game is an excellent 3D landing simulator with superb physics simulation that allows for all angles of camera view and multi split screening for precise landing and threat analysis.  The game is a great progression from that old classic with added multiplayer support, weapon systems that also include counter-measures, and now has "Oculus Rift" Integration as well.  You can control x,y,z axis' and spin of your craft as well as angle and speed of the module.  The game gives you tasks like delivering supplies, Steam achievements to farm for and trading cards to earn.

A 3D lunar landscape faces you out the window as you recheck calculations to ensure your thrusters are pulsing enough to lift you and your cargo. Certainly more complicated than the original game, this takes some getting used to. Still, if you're willing to sit through a nicely done tutorial, you'll be flying missions in no time.

If anyone remembers 'Lunar Lander' type games (like Jupiter Lander on the C64), this is more or less the same, only more sophisticated and in 3d. The gameplay itself is fun and personally I didn't find the lunar lander hard to control, so don't worry if you are not a hardcore simulation freak - it's fun for 'casuals' as well. The atmosphere is great, in the background you can hear radio communication of (real?) astronauts and the music is the typical, slow 'space synthesizer' music. Even the graphics are very good - obviously there is not much to see as the game plays on the Moon and Mars, but what is there looks very nice and runs flawlessly even on slower machines.\n\nThe game does become a bit repetitive after a while since there are only three different types of missions on 4 maps (with varying difficulty) and the multiplayer is apparently dead.

And the Mars map, forget it until you've upgraded your lander with Level 3 technology.\n\nJust wished there were maps for other locations in the solar system.

In Lunar Flight, the simulation is realistic, it respects the laws of Newton and it gives you the feeling of driving the real lander.\nIt takes time to get aquanted to the controls and the most difficult part perhaps is to get trained on yaw, pitch and roll, i.e. the real attitude. You can progress a lot without using YPR commands, but the most rewarding part comes when you manage those controls.\nThe graphic part is accurate: light, dust, shadows are just ok and on a recent PC it flows quite smoothly. The soundtrack is really good: it is an ambient track which fits the deepness of the moon environment, in which everithing else is silent. Always on audio, the flight controllers dialogues are a bit repetitive and once you got the main dialogue it's a bit boring hearing over and over.\nOk, I don't know if in a future in which the man could be on the Moon the best vehichle to use would be a Lander like the one in Lunar Flight,  which is almost the same of 1969-1973 Apollo Missions. Anyway, especially with the 3D environment, the simulation is really immersive. I also suppose that the Oculus Rift port will be amazing.\nConcerning single player, the major missions are  transport, cargo rescue and going from A->B. Some cargo rescue missions are quite difficult and be sure to have additional tank of fuel with you. Additional missions typology other than could be beneficial to the longevity. I personally don't care too much about multiplayer on this game.\nThe upgrade system is normal: make money with missions, upgrade tools and so on, but IMO it does not really drive the game/story.\nSomething I really miss is a Linux porting: I'd like to be able to play it also on that platform.\nIn synthesis, I definitely recommend this game if you are a passionate about astronautics and have the patience to learn how to control the lander, which is not immediate.","December 28, 2014","true","15.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Pootz's music for the game is awesome, listen to it frequently!!\n\nOne major negative about the game though, suffered a hard drive crash and can no longer continue my pilot that I had over 200 hours playing with, real bummer!!! Also there's little support for problems with the game. The Lunar Flight forum is pretty much useless, when there's no answer to a question posed from several months earlier, then what's the use for a forum.\n\nJust hate that I invested that much time and cannot continue with my same pilot. Was in 3rd place on the global "Experience" leaderboard behind FlukeRogi and Ripcurl. Actuallly was told that Ripcurl has had the same thing happen to him, hard drive failure and can't continue his pilot.

Despite being published over four years ago the dev keeps adding to it and making it better!  It's rare to see a Developer this dedicated to their product!\n\nHe is now working hard implementing Oculus (VR) support.  As if the game wasn't great enough already it is quite something to sit in the module in VR!  Even if you don't have a VR HMD (YET!) this sim is still well worth the asking price.  There's even a motion module being developed by the folks who made simtools so you can only imagine how sweet this is going to be with full VR immersion and motion!","March 10","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Once you figure out the somewhat involved method to take off, traverse to the next checkpoint and land safely then you will start getting lost for hours building up experience on the lunar maps. After that, you upgrade your craft and attempt more complicated travel maneuvers involving axis rotation that reduce fuel use and speeds up mission times.\n\nWhile many VR games are more fun standing up, this game improves with sitting down and taking your time. Outside of multiplayer combat which I have not done, there's little need for twitch style gameplay. Take it slow and have a blast with the relaxing gameplay (well, relaxing till you actually have to slow descent and land correctly).","February 7","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
