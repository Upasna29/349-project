There I found a sniper rifle, almost as if that's what it was planning to screw me over with next. I took that sniper rifle and, that night, baited the creature into a barren basin at the foot of a hill where I shot it half to death as it ran around screeching in pain and baffled rage. It eventually fled back to my camp where it murdered my pet pig out of spite before I blew its face open ten feet from the treeline it was attempting to ambush me from.\nI had a wonderful time with Rake but you know, I wouldn't have done if I didn't have to suffer its outrageous failings first. If this was anything approaching a competent experience with well tuned mechanics, I'd have killed that yellow little freak in like ten minutes and forgot all about it. But I will remember this. I will remember the joy of plugging it full of lead from a hunting blind as it sprinted from one end of the hill to the other, wondering where its tactics had failed it. Sometimes to kill a monster, you have to play one.\nCheck out the hunt below.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=He3liV9r348","July 15, 2015","true","6.7"," 540 of 583 people (93%) found this review helpful 363 people found this review funny","93","540","583","363","15"

I just wanted to kick back in the forest. Sunbathe on the warm rocks. Mingle with the gentle deer and playful pigs that roam the valleys. Until the monster came. Soon, I was being spied on every moment. I could no longer luxuriate nude in the green grasses. I could no longer ride the pigs for amusement. It arrived in the belly of a metal beast. It's glassy eyes spread throughout the woods. It raided and stole from the many places I had once frolicked. It lured and trapped my pig friends, only to bind more all-seeing eyes upon their delicate heads. At night, it would watch for me. Waiting so that it might make sport of hunting me.\n\nThe first night, I wanted only to fall into slumber outside its many invasive eyes. I destroyed them as they hung suspended from the trees. Perhaps if I could make it understand that I only wanted my peace and privacy, it would leave. But alas, my efforts were in vain. By the next night, all damage would be repaired. The eyes continue to watch.\n\nI met my once-friend pig in the woods outside the monster's encampment. My dear friend had succumbed to the monster's evil. Its eyes stared dumbly back at me, even as that all-eye watched from atop a tortured head. I had no choice. I had to set my once-companion free. I whispered gently as I held his head in my arms, stroking the matted fur. I whispered of times now past. Of romps through the forest and friendship now gone. I twisted then, violently. His head came away in my arms. I wept bitterly, my tears salty in my throat. I left the body there. I could not bear the sight.\n\nThe second night, the nightmare was born anew. More dumb stares. More friends gone to the tortures of the thing hiding in the metal beast. I stared into the glass eyes of the metal beast, catching glimpses of the villain. My rage grew. I took the heads of my friends, determined to send a message. I would not back down any longer. It would not break my resolve. My friend's deaths would not be meaningless. I mounted them. I left them standing proudly upon pikes. Accusing eyes leveled at the hidden monster. To greet it when it emerged with the morning. To haunt it as I was now haunted.\n\nThe third night, I knew what had to be done. I could be passive no longer. I would confront the evil that besmirched my woods. I would cleanse it from the earth. It had set traps for me. Metal teeth digging deep into my vulnerable flesh. I screamed in pain. But I remembered my pig friends. I remembered their pain. Their sacrifice. I pressed on. I could see it inside. I leapt.\n\nA resounding boom. A hot, heavy pressure hit my chest. My ribcage shattered with the force. I fell backwards. The metal beast was opening, but I could not see through the haze of my pain. I could only taste the copper in my mouth. Feel the burn spreading through my body as my life ebbed away.\n\nThe monster was standing over me. I looked up at it as the last of my life left me. I wanted to ask it. Why? Why did you torment me? What pain did I ever cause you? What pain did my beloved friends ever cause you? It looked down at me without pity.\n\nThere was another blast. The sound seemed to split my ear drums. Then nothing. Only the blackness.\n\n10 / 10 - Would roleplay again.","October 15, 2015","true","3.1"," 281 of 307 people (92%) found this review helpful 177 people found this review funny","92","281","307","177","11"

(Obviously this no longer applies.)\n\nCons:\n\n-Pre-made Unity Assets (Not confirmed but.... Yeah.)\n-These Devs have proven they don't know horror, so this game isn't really "scary".\n-Poor textures\n-Unoptimized (Four settings: Low, Medium, High, and Ultra. With a GTX 970 I drop to 58fps on Medium at 1080p). *Updated below\n-Cameras shake too much\n-Clunky controls\n-Garbage interface\n-No tutorial\n-Tells you to pick up a rifle and rifle ammo, but the gun used is a shotgun. "Just to be fair, its common for a shotgun to be called a rifle in most areas of Europe. So, that one is just a cultural difference." -Pointed out by Monolith\n-No crosshairs or ironsites, only a slight zoom.\n-The Monster isn't scary, only generic.\n-Only a max of five cameras at once\n\nPros:\n\n-The camera feature is pretty cool\n-Atmospheric at night\n-You can put a camera on a pig. I love this. It's the reason I'm not getting a refund.\n-Monster can destroy cameras, so you have to set them up again. In the dark. Or you could just hide until morning like me.\n-Traps.\n\nAll together, I'd say this is just BARELY worth the $5 they are asking for... and only if the idea really intrigues you.\nBut for everyone else I'd say just pass this.\n\nGood job Konsordo, this is your best game yet.\n\n*First impressions review, will update as I play more.\n\nUPDATES:\n\nCons:\n\n-I hit 30fps. 30. with a GTX 970 on Medium settings. Okay.\n-Nearly every time I try to pull out my Tablet Computer (Map) it bugs out and puts it away.\n-The elk make scarier sounds than your monster does.\n\nPros:\n-Found a place that sent a chill up my spine. Bravo.\n\nI decided that for $5, this game isn't your worst option.\n\n18fps. I got 18fps. Jeeze.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nPlease do the world a favor, and continue this series, because honestly I had a lot of fun getting revenge for the death of Piggy. Long live Piggy! Long live free pigs!\n\nAnd to Hell with you, Rake.\n\nPost-updates:\n\n- Optimization. I can now run Rake at max settings with my FPS only dropping below 60 when near water.\n- Improved Rake AI. The Rake now deals more damage (seems like it), runs faster, and is more aggressive.\n\nCurator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/","July 14, 2015","true","6.3"," 581 of 700 people (83%) found this review helpful 168 people found this review funny","83","581","700","168","49"

Obviously the game has a few weak spots, but dont all games? . When I first got it, my friend told me to stop being a wus, leave the RV and hunt the Rake. I was pretty scared but he said the monster was rediculous. I was walking through the woods when I heard footsteps. It was the rake. It wasnt too scary causeI heard him from a mile away and he wasnt very stealthy. Then I saw there was an update. After I saw the patch notes, I saw he had a new model and improved AI (along with a few other things). I had a good feeling about the update. It was night 1 and I decided to walk outside. I began aproaching the swamp, when out of NO WHERE he jumped me from behind and took away half my health. I knew this game was WORKED ON. It went from me just hunting the rake senselessly, without being scared what so ever, to me being forced to use a strategy. If I didnt, not only did I die, but I also blew a hole through my underwear. My point, dont judge a game of the first few days. It is an AMAZING concept and will continue to be worked on. IGN 9.5 outa 10. It has incredible potential and great features. This is definatly worth the 5 bucks. It IS scary, and I reccommend it to anyone who is a fan of this type of thing (Please keep in mind my review goes off my standards for a game by such a small and inexpirienced company. Konsordo did the best he could to the extent of his knowledge, and to create a game as great as this is good enough for me.)","July 18, 2015","true","26.4"," 183 of 213 people (86%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","86","183","213","41","1"

During the night you have to return to your truck and via a monitor you can see what are your cameras watching. Armed with a sawed-off shotgun you have to kill it if its necessary (and trust me, it is).\n\nAs i mentioned before, this game has only three nights that means that this game is too short, but worth the value. Each night will be different as others. Warning: Spoiler alert Resuming the three nights :\n\nThe first night:All should be good at your first night in the forest, your cameras will see it but you're safe here, only a few of them will disappear due the rake now knows that you're here.\n\nThe second night:After the second night a dead pig will appear in front of your truck, the rake will destroy almost all your cams, he will appear many times.\n\nThe third night:He is too angry at this point, many impaled head pigs will appear in front of your truck. During the night the rake will try to get into your truck destroying windows and walking around your truck. This is your last chance to kill it.\nGraphically looks a bit odd but good, background sound it's immersive and makes this game a wondeful but at the same time a thrilling experience that you won't forget.\n\nThis game is a great combination of mystery and thrill. I definitely recommend this game.\n9 / 10\n\nIf you found this review helpful you can find out more at our Completing the Backlog's Curator page.","January 5","true","270.4"," 109 of 131 people (83%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","83","109","131","10","8"

ECT. but most the time there isn't anything there.)\n- Framerate ( its seems to work okay but it doesn't like to run over 50 unless im looking directly at the ground.)\n\nThis game is amazing, its probably the best horror game to come out of the indie scene this year, its intense, scary, immersive, and just plain fun. I really hope the dev sees this and fixes some of the issues i've listed so that the game can become a much more entertaining experience. I would recommend this to people who are willing to put some time into a horror game and explore the world it give you. Its absolutely worth the $5.  7/10 (not perfect but good)","August 4, 2015","true","2.4"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","92","57","62","7","0"

So allow me to summarize both of our experiences.\n\nMy expedition;\n\nNIGHT 1\nFirst 2 minutes are all quiet, nothing happening, Cam 4 picks up movement, I click on it and see two blaring eyes running towards the camera and I see the monster as it rips my camera to shreds. I think to myself "What the fresh hell?! I thought the reviews said this ♥♥♥♥ only happend on the 3rd night!" two more cameras are taken down in the time frame of 5 or 6 minutes, and I periodically peer through the windows of my camper to see if it's out there, to afraid to go out after he's already done so much damage in so little time. 11 minutes have passed since I began the night, and now I hear the sound of footsteps off to the left of Cam 1, which is located right outside the Camper, over-looking the camp site, followed by the sounds of a hog squealling and then some horrible screech followed by slashing noises and then it's all quiet.. the rest of the night is spent panicking in the RV as I look out my windows and remaining cameras, even though the monster decides he's had his fun and phones it in.\n\nThe day after there's a dead pig right next to the cage outside my camper, nothing else, other than a couple pools of blood scattered across the forest.\n\nNIGHT 2\nFirst 2-3 minutes is all quiet, then the same ♥♥♥♥ happens where I see it mauling one of my far out cameras. I quickly switch to Cam 4 which is in just the right spot that I can turn it enough to see it attacking Cam 5. I decide "I've got my gun and night-vision binocs, time to see if I can take him down!" I decide he'll likely attack Cam 4 now, since it's within the immediate area of Cam 5, I run all the way out there, expecting to see it... it's not there, and my camera is still functional. I panic, because I know it sees me, and I don't want to try to run back to my Camper, I'd be even more screwed in there than I am out here in that small closed coffin on wheels, unless he miracously didn't track me back there. So I walk slowly back towards my camp, hoping to use the pig in the cage as an early warning system, and then have that 'nice' lazy man's campfire light in the middle of the camp to help me see it... that didn't happen. I heard it to my left and it lept out of a bush and painted the trail with my blood.. shooting it seemed to just ♥♥♥♥ it off..\n\nMy friends' expedition;\n\nNIGHT 1\n\nNothing happens.. seriously.. zip nada zilch.\n\nNext day however there's a dead pig right outside his Camper\n\nNIGHT 2\n\nSame thing as Night 1... he's so much more damn lucky it would appear\n\nWhen he wakes up this time however, there's 3 pig heads mounted on sticks right outside his Camper.

It's too bad as well, because a friend was kind enough to gift this game to me - I really wish I could recommend it. :(\n\nSimply put, what we have here is a great concept poorly executed with terrible pacing and wonky controls, a game with flashes of brilliance that gets boring and tedious extremely fast, yet looks fun if heavily edited on Youtube. Some would even call it PewDiebait.\n\nThe game starts off promising: you're a "ghost hunter" camping out in the woods looking for something  not entirely natural. You grab your cameras, you grab your gun, and you set out to explore your surroundings and set up some surveillance. The atmosphere can actually be pretty good at times, and you'll probably experience a jump scare or two at some point, but then unfortunately, the game falls apart.\n\nThe cameras you set up? They occasionally provide you with a super-spooptacular glimpse of the creature, but you realize pretty quickly that your only goal is to kill the monster - and cameras don't help with that. Instead, you step outside your RV, wander a few feet away, wait for the sound of footsteps, turn, and fire.\n\nAgain, and again, and again. If you do this enough you kill the creature and you win. If you don't do this enough, you lose. You might think I'm exaggerating the simplicity of the game, but I'm not. This is literally what the game boils down to,  once you see through the uselessness of cameras, pigs, and exploring. Considering that's all this game has to offer, considering its extremely short length and redundancy, the wonky controls, fugly graphics and tedious mechanics, you're better off picking up something else for the $5 asking price.","January 27","false","2.8"," 82 of 110 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","82","110","8","52"

Rake is an interesting game based off a Creepy Pasta of the same name.\n\nYou play as a hunter in the middle of a forest with a hunting rifle and sniper rifle to defend yourself with. During the day you set up digital cameras, animal feed and bear traps and during the night time you sit in your caravan, watch your cameras for movement and try to find The Rake somewhere out there in the darkness.\n\nIt's terrifying at first until you realize The Rake reacts the same way every single time, running straight towards you, knocking you over then running away. Once you get a bead on his location it's easy to keep him in your sights and make sure he never gets the drop on you, even if it does take 30 odd shots to put him down.\n\nThis is a neat concept but deceptively basic and there isn't all that much to talk about or experience. Like the Slenderman games it seems to hinge more on the popularity it has as a Creepy Pasta, more than it does try to be its own thing. It's not early access but it sure does feel like it at times and Unity engine is at its unoptimized best, dipping into single digits on the lowest graphical settings.\n\nI guess if you have a Let's Play channel this is a no brainer to pick up, everyone else might want to hold off.\n\nFull video review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HeNbr8qLiyM","July 16, 2015","false","3.0"," 81 of 122 people (66%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","66","81","122","4","7"

It's as boring as it sounds and, with no sound alerts, you're actually forced to keep your eyes on the camera icons for 30 actual minutes hoping something will happen. Even if something does the flickering, lack of zoom and limited panning options make cameras an interesting concept delivered extremely poorly.\n\nGoing out in the dark means either blindly walking around or trying to set up an hunting position but either way it won't be much fun. Guns are pretty weak and the Rake is a bullet sponge meaning it'll take alot of shooting to bring it down, you also have limited bullets so good luck with that. Bear traps are so-so, sometimes they'll stop the creature for a second or two while most of the time they'll simply damage it a little before it quickly runs away...oh and sometimes it'll manage to walk over them and reach you anyway. Each time the Rake gets too close you'll see a cutscene of it wounding you, you falling down and then getting on your feet again as the creatures flees so basically you can't do anything whenever you get caught: and you'll easily get caught as the creature it very fast and able to close distance in a matter of seconds.\n\nWith clunky mechanics, subpar production values and very little in the way of atmosphere Rake is simply an example of a game that fails to do justice to its source material and, adding the fact the devs abandoned it, one I can't recommend.","April 18","false","4.4"," 29 of 34 people (85%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","85","29","34","8","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Janas-Aurora/recommended/386880/","Janas-Aurora","Janas","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Janas-Aurora/","97 products in account","Prepare for the longest review I will probably ever write. Mostly because I can, it's an enjoyable foray, but needs serious work.\n\n[Warning; sailor talk and potential (minor) spoilers below]\n\n\n(As of 10/20/2015,) I'm giving this project a very tentative yes and thumbs up. As has been said before, and I completely agree, this game has a lot of positive elements going for it right from the start.  For so little content, the idea is extremely fetching, and the replay value is surprisingly high, even WITH the ending being what it is (without bothering with detailed spoilers, beating the game in its' current state should result in a chuckle, smirk, or at least a raised eyebrow).\n\nObserving the (fictional) cryptid in the dark of night with limited range night vision cameras and nothing but the otherwise-calming sounds of nature to comfort you, or a wide-angled, convenient set of.. well, a magnified monocular, which when paired with a flipped on flashlight, mystically becomes wide-reaching suitable night vision mode. *shrug* Having Rake scramble from the dark to knock the crap out of the cameras provides good tension and a startle or two.\n\nFinding this critter's den, or traces of it's prey, be it hominid or otherwise, stumbling a little too close in the daylight only to get ♥♥♥♥♥-slapped to the ground by the thing before it takes off because you will quickly learn that it is an absolute virtuoso premier in dickery, is all good stuff, and offers immersion.\n\nSo I had some difficulty in figuring out precisely what the goal of the game was.  It is clear you were intended to be armed. It was also fairly clear that you are immediately encouraged to deal with your closest forest friends, (pigs), who like archangels at the wings of Saint Michael, ... are sent forth into the dark calamity of hostile woodlands, blind and dumb, but with cameras attached to their necks so you can sit in your camper and watch with intense interest as they wander aimlessly, keep getting caught in your trap (which has no feed in it), and occasionally saunter into the unlucky spot where the Wendigo is watching, who sprints by and slaps the life out of their poor, succulent, delicious bacony bodies. I am unsure what sordid pleasure the protagonist gains from this viewing, but I admit to partaking in it a few times. While you can catch a pig, there was no indication that you could catch Rake, and furthermore the magic journal which I will mention, makes no mention itself of 'capturing' Rake as a priority.\n\nYou are given a fair amount of gear, at least that I've found, to work with. Several traps, a scoped rifle with an awkward two-round built-in magazine, roughly forty shotgun shells for your starter 'rifle' [an over and under model], (Sort of a misnomer considering shotguns don't usually have rifling), and, ah of course, unlimited amount of piglet feed!  Lovely. Absolutely smashing.  The piglet feed and cameras will respawn after each day. But that is where the limitless supplies end. You're also given a kind of PDA/tablet, which functions as a map and indicator of where cameras are placed, and nothing else.\n\nYou are lent a magical journal beside the desk of your interior camper, which updates itself automatically day in and day out, as though it is tied directly to the plot and your actions have no bearing on it whatsoever. Not that it would help enormously, as it's written in utterly heart-warming broken English, just like the controls setup menu. Bear with us.\n\nThere are several hunting blinds scattered across the map, and to my knowledge they affect an invisibility cloak over your character such that you can throw lead at the Rake without fear of his dreaded, horrifying open-hand slap. (I learned this from reading it, not trying it out, as it seemed rather stupid to me to detach yourself from your camera read-out hub in the trailer to stand around for a half-hour in some stubby, four-cornered, windowless tower to wait for Rake to appear).\n\nGoing into Rake combat..\n\nYou see, it seems dickery is key to the Rake, in a certain sense. It is difficult to kill, not because it is just so frightening that it's presence is unbearable, nor because it is all that powerful, or excessively intelligent. It is a pain in the ♥♥♥ because it's means of committing to mortal puglism is by sprinting by just under mach one (that is 766 miles per hour for you dare devils out there), open-hand slapping you as hard as you can upside the head, and trotting merrily away (at a leisurely 75 miles-per-hour) joyous and content in the knowledge that, should he die soon, he (I assume it is male) shall be projected straight to the Valhalla of frat boy ♥♥♥♥-butts, where he will serenely paint the faces of his drunken passed out peers with phalluses for the rest of eternity.  'Rake' is indeed a master of the cheap shot to the temple.  He ensures that after you've just been smacked to the ground he is well on his sprint to a nearby tree, after which, with perfect night-vision, he will commence masturbatory celebration as he watches you hold your aching head and glare angrily into the dark. At least, this is the kind of place I imagine that lank freakshow that I just killed would like to call heaven.\n\nWhat I mean to say is that this fella is a hit and run fighter. It would seem also that a fair name for the creature could also be Wendigo, considering its' speed on the ground.\n\n\nTo run down the usefulness of each bit of gear, I take issue with what you're given and it's functionality. Cameras are only useful insofar as they function to take note of where the Rake is. Cameras are not numbered either. You have to use that noggin of yours to recall where each camera was placed and in what order, maximum of five. After they're destroyed they are, obviously, useless and lost until the next respawn. Being that at least half of the game involves setting up cameras, the limited use of them is something of a bother. Not that I expect auto-turrets, but some kind of intelligent system that allows an affected camera to sound out a short alarm, or for your otherwise-useless tablet to be able to remotely connect to the cameras.. that would have been nice. Instead if you want eyes in the night you have five cameras to look through, but only from the confines of your trailer, or your own naked eyes with assistance of a psuedo-nightvision monocular, or a narrow sight on the scoped rifle. Not very promising, really. And considering this Wendigo is lightning-fast, you aren't intended to be able to easily hunt him with eyes and luck alone.\n\nThe 'rifle' is handy more because of the amount of initial ammunition you are granted for it then it's lethality.  At something like 40 rounds, you may have just enough to kill Rake if you make every single shot count. Otherwise, you can easily see yourself running dry while the gangly little hooligan still breathes.\n\n\nYou're given a 'sniper rifle', which while I understood the purpose of, could not really bring myself to use since I knew of no definite way to lure the Wendigo into a long narrow passage about 60-80 meters away from me in a straight path, which is really the only locale under which I would personally find this rifle useful. The forest is too dense and full of sight-blocking brush.  You can't move when aiming it, which is fair, but as of writing this review, aiming the thing is tough enough due to the amount of awkward sway the scope lends at the slightest movement. The central sight will overshoot the actual point of aim quite easily, so in a sense you have to aim it in short bursts and hold it there to check where the actual point of aim is.  Not a great mechanic.  The protagonist also holds the sight much too far from his eye, as though it's a reflex sight and not a magnified scope.  Oh well.   A big issue with this weapon is it's finite ammo and two-round capacity.  If I recall correctly, you can find about 18 rounds with this weapon.","October 22, 2015","true","9.7"," 39 of 53 people (74%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","74","39","53","18","16"

I hands down love this game and i ask only for one thing in which i believe would make this game much more fun and extended. I honestly love how day cycles go and the steup phase of the game, it makes you think about your camera layout and everything, and when night comes everything comes together and your camera layout could have worked out or not. Days pass and i found myself having an immense amount of fun and being scared at the same time yet after the everjoying last night, i was halted with a "sorry, you lose!" text. After that, i was brought back to the main menu in which i had to start a new game, opposite of what i wanted. I would very much like if you, by any chance, made it somehow where someone (like me) could take their time trying to hunt the rake and develop a good, deep, and rich sense of paranoia and fear of whats lurking in the shadows. If something like that wasnt expected is it possible for an extended time within the game before losing? i felt taking my time the way i did made this game give me a great sense of what could happen. anywho, i know your game will do amazingly well and i plan to play it again and actually defeat the rake!!","August 2, 2015","true","5.1"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","17","18","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silver-Sama/recommended/386880/","Silver-Sama","Silverrrrr","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Silver-Sama/","223 products in account","For some reason my game didn't record all my playtime, I played for just under 2 hours.\n\nI bought Rake because my friend told me to, saying we could play multiplayer and get hunted together. I mean, sure why not. I like getting reamed while I make eye contact with my only friend, croaking the words "I trusted you" through a mouthful of blood, tears and pig feces.\n\nWe started a server, it was night. "Oh this isn't good" he said, and I turned to face him. "Why? What's so wrong?" I implored him, surely he was just overreacting. I mean we just started! He turned back to me, coldly stating:\n\n"It shouldn't be night."\n\nOvercome with terror, he bolted into the camper van. Phasing through the door like a spooky ghost and yelling at me to get in. After a few minutes of us hiding, I started looking around the van, finding plenty of $1 wallmart cameras to snag like the rampant cleptomaniac I am. Ending up with so many cameras, my camera counter went past 99 and broke itself at 10 permanently.\n\nTurning to face him with my lovely cargo shorts filled to the bulging brim with shoddy electrical equipment, I found my friend clutching a shotgun and staring with unflinching terror at an old CRT television screen which was nothing but snowflake static.\n\nI ask where my gun was, and he said there was only one. I asked what to do next then, to which he replied. "Go outside and set up cameras."\n\nI walked outside armed with my assortment of ♥♥♥♥ cameras and NOTHING ELSE. And proceeded to place them on the trees. Whistling the Tetris theme to myself. "This game isn't too scary. It's just dark!" I thought. But after placing the 4th camera down, I heard footsteps. And not normal footsteps, they were turbo footsteps. Footsteps so fast, it sounded like someone was chasing me through the power of tapdancing.\n\nI hardly have time to react before my screen is locked onto what could only be described as a slimy Old Benjamin Button with sausage fingers, screeching in my face and delivering a nasty pimp-slap to my virgin cheek.\n\nI scream out in horror, and my friend is cackling like a madman over the mic. Before I can ask him what's so godamn funny, I hear Sammy Davis Jr. tapping his way over to me again. I try my damndest to run, but alas I get another brutal backhand and a firm groping.\n\nUpon recovering, I frantically try to navigate home, before yet again I hear the rampant stomps of Edward Sausage-hands. I try running but of course he smacks me again. And then another time after that.\n♥♥♥♥ finding my way home. I just need to RUN.\n\nAfter crying like a wet ♥♥♥♥♥ I bolted into the forest leaving a trail of misery, blood and most certainly urine as the tapdancing kept following me, however it finally subsided and I hid in the world's smallest treehouse. At this point me and my friend were both gasping for air, however for different reasons. He had nearly given himself a stroke while laughing, whearas I had my lungs rearranged to my anal cavity by the rampaging scrotum monster.\n\n"I was watching that ♥♥♥♥ing thing smack you around the entire time" He delivered through girlish giggles, the sound of which would haunt my dreams. As I was now effectively lost.\n\n30 minutes of wandering finally got me back to the site, and I rushed into the van, and cut my friend a cold stare for a while. "Why don't you go? You have the gun!" I asked, frustrated and still in a dire need of new underwear at that point.\n\n"Because I'm scared"\n\nAnd to think he wanted to be in the army.\n\nAfter slapping him around a bit, I finally convinced him to come WITH me on my IT department runs, where we just frolicked through the forest, planting cameras on all the good little trees. Everything was fine until...\n\nWe heard IT.\n\nThe footsteps rapidly approached, and in our view were 2 piercing white eyes, speeding towards us. In a mixture of high pitched adult baby screams, my friend finally used his boomstick, loading 2 rounds between the ♥♥♥♥er's eyes and dropping him, it let out a loud squeal of agony before going quiet.\n\nThe stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s had shot a pig.\n\nAfter having a moment of silence for our late friend Wilbur, we hastilly ran up the trail to a house. Where I finally got my own shotgun with 2 bullets and nothing else. Then the Silent Hill jumpscare descended through a crack in the roof, shaking me around violently before jumping away quickly.\n\nThe greasy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stole my only 2 bullets.\n\nNow armed with nothing but cameras and a walking stick with a trigger on it, I followed my friend around the forest. And this is where the game got bad.\n\nWe went to the ravine.\n\nThere was no Rake.\n\nWe went to the scary waterfall cave that made a bunch of disgusting loud noises.\n\nAll we found was a toaster and a battery.\n\nWe went to the swamp.\n\nIt smelt like ♥♥♥♥.\n\nAfter about 45 minute of wandering, the mood shifted from fear to tedium as we were just begging for the Rake at this point. Stripping off our clothes and gyrating our hips while lathering ourselves in BBQ sauce and screaming memes out into the darkness. (Memes of course being the mating call for the typical jumpscare)\n\nHowever it didn't show. And we just wandered, searching high and low for anything cool. Eventually we found some kind of dungeon building that had heavilly eroded, being the brave soul I am, I went first. Where I was then cutscene'd to the ground TWICE by the half digested Xenomorph before it ♥♥♥♥ed off for good.\n\nAfter dusting myself off and getting rid of the super wedgie it gave me, I turned to see my friend holding a Sniper rifle he had just looted from the building while I still had no ammo and very little health.\n\nLooks like I know who I'm not inviting to my birthday parties anymore.\n\nAfter all that, our final stop was a grimy shack, where I found beartraps. A ♥♥♥♥ ton of them. Which I then immediately started to place around the area for safety. After taking one long look at the now fortified site, I saw my friend walk over one. (The same one we both walked over 20 times) and he suddenly died. Flopping forward and not moving at all.\n\nUnmotivated to leave and try to find his respawn point, I started to stack bear traps like Jigsaw's version of Jenga. Until suddenly one of the traps sprang from the stack, embedding itself in my groin and killing me instantly.\n\n\nOur bodies were never recovered.\n\n\nAll in all this game was fun for a little while with a buddy, then it was just extremely buggy because the Rake got stuck on trees, bushes, cars, lamps, or particularly thick chunks of absolutely nothing. Very little ammo to go around, no day/night cycle, and pretty much no reason to play for more than 10 minutes. Once you start to feel bored, that means there's literally nothing else to experience. For 5 bucks I shouldn't complain much, but then again, I've seen more funtional Alpha builds that were more enjoyable selling themselves for like 99 cents.","March 2","false","0.1"," 34 of 48 people (71%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","71","34","48","56","5"

Here are the pros and cons of this game.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful landscape.\n-Creepy atmosphere at night.\n-Suspenseful! Even when in your trailer YOU ARE NOT SAFE.\n-Moving pig camera...nuff said.\n-Rake can attack during the day (although it is unlikely).\n-You need to find some of the gear that is necessary for your survival (bear traps, sniper rifle, extra ammo, etc)\n-You get to hunt the monster instead of just running away and hiding.\n-MULTIPLAYER COMING.\n-Open world.\n-Based on a kickass creepy pasta!\n\nCons:\n-Only 3 nights. More would be fun.\n-Once your windows are gone, they are gone. You should be able to repair them.\n-More bear traps would be good.\n-Only 5 cameras allowed.\n-Kinda slow the first two nights unless you look for the Rake.\n-Only two weapons with limited ammo. Sucks when you run out.\n-FPS never goes above 60 unless looking straight up or straight down(heard of this happening to others as well).\n\nAll in all, the game is pretty good but has room for improvement. The developer has made a game that is scary and fun. I would give this game an 8/10.

And it appears to be poorly translated from some other language. But overall, the atmosphere is truly terrifying. Here is the story of my first night in Rake:\n\nI had spent the day setting up trail cams. I had four set up a good distance from each other to get fairly good coverage of the forest. I even had one attached to a pig that aimlessly wandered in and out of my camp. Then when night came around, I sat in my trailer and monitored my cameras. It was mostly uneventful: I would stair at the screen and switch cameras whenever I saw a motion sensor go off, but it was always just a deer or a pig that had triggered it. However, the whole time I had this unending sense of being watched and found myself constantly checking the windows of my trailer to see if anything had wandered into my camp. I would even occasionally hear footsteps as that pig wandered through my camp again. But then, I saw one of my motion sensors go off again and clicked over to that camera. When I saw that thing shambling off into the woods and making some unholy moaning noise, I immediately began to question my decision to play this at 11 o'clock at night.\n\nThe game is honestly pretty scary and has a sort of Five Nights at Freddy's meets Slender feel to it.

All you have to do is shoot him before he attacks you and you'll give him damage, shoot him enough times and you kill him.

It has an extremely scary atmostphere and sometimes you don't even want to leave your little camper you start in. What kills it for me though is a bug that allows the monster to hid you through the walls of the camper. I understand it's early access but this is pretty game breaking when you don't even have a safe place to hide and watch your cameras, especially since the monster always knows your location. Gonna have to give it a "No" until that's fixed, otherwise it would certainly be worth a few bucks for the atmostphere alone.

I run outside and crap my pants when the pig i captured at day squeals, i run inside and left the game.\n\nSecond game: -first day, i went off to the woods listening to "what is love" to make my childlike attitude disappear, i patiently took my time to explore the place, found some traps and other useful things.

I head back to my wan and sletp the rest of the day.\n\nSecond game: -first night, i watch the cameras for a sometime until one gets destroyed, i then gather myself and to the woods. After a minute or two i find a tower in the middle of the large road, i throw a trap to the ladders and climb up. I wait for sometime looking through my scope with the rifle until i see it! Walking on the road, i shoot it three times hitting every single on and the creature flees to the deep woods. I again wait for it to show up on the road and repeath this for a couple times. At the end of the night the damn thing has only around 20% of its health left, i spot it last time at the road and load my last sniper clip to it. The things dying and i jump off my tower and give chase, i run after it and load it with my shotgun everytime it tryes to counter attack. The creature with only about 5% of its health left decides to make run for it, it flees through the mountain where i corner it to the rear of a small canyon. I shot the thing in the head and it fell to the ground dead and lifeless as were my ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pants next to me from the last game.\n\nPros:\n-The athmosphere at the start was nice\n-The diffrent objects around the map are nice to look for\n-Gets adrenaline pumping when your near the kill\n-pigs\n\nCons:\n-The Rake seemed to repeat its walking pattern wich made it a bit too easy to kill it\n-The diffrent objects are found pretty easily when you know where they are\n-Rakes animation looks a bit silly\n-When you kill the Rake you just fly to the menu, i would suggest somekind of a ending showing newspaper about how you have brought the dead Rake to the public, or that you have been missing for sometime. (if you lost)\n\nOverall a nice game that i have fun with, i cant wait for the co-op, but i really hope that it allows more than one hunters and maybe a Rake vs hunters mode.\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","4","5","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpleloosestrife/recommended/386880/","purpleloosestrife","Black Lacey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/purpleloosestrife/","98 products in account","(Author's Note: I put quite a bit of time and effort into this review. As such it's rather long. There's a TL;DR at the bottom for those of you who like to keep things short and sweet. Thanks for reading! :D )\n\nI'm in a bit of a pickle here; while I cannot recommend this title in its current state, I also cannot condemn it entirely. It has the feel of being either a first attempt at game development, or at the very least the work of someone inexperienced. Thankfully, Mr. Google supplied me with confirmation of this suspicion. Of Konsordo's three titles on Steam, this is the only one with an overall positive rating. They're definitely not part of the human cancer that dumps sh!77y games on Steam and finds stupid ways to prevent people from getting refunds. They're just a small developer with limited experience.\n\nI challenge anyone who reads this review to find any developer whose first few titles were flawless.\n\nUnfortunately, Rake suffers from some flaws that are difficult to forgive. Poor optimization is one big glaring example. My rig isn't a monster, but it's decent. Despite that, I experienced frequent frame rate drops that rendered the game nearly unplayable. If it had top-notch graphics, I wouldn't mind so much. Sadly when I attempted playing this title on the highest graphics settings (clocking approximately 10 FPS), I saw that the game looked like something developed around 2008.\n\nThe controls are finicky. In order to place a camera, you have to position yourself just right, otherwise you'll be mashing the E key all day. Most of the items in your inventory are assigned a key to bring it out, but I found no way to put these items away once I had them short of opening the inventory and closing it again.\n\nThe AI for wildlife is a joke. When I set up a critter cam on a pig, every time without fail the pig would walk the exact same path, run into the exact same invisible walls, and then wander back into the live animal trap in the camp. Having to re-release the pig every five minutes got old real quick. It's like when they're not in panic mode, the animals are on invisible tracks, much like the NPCs in Morrowind, circa 2003.\n\nThe static effects on the game cams are overdone. This might sound like nit-picking, but it was bad enough to give me motion sickness. Over-effect is almost never a good design choice.\n\nAnother effect that seems to be overused is motion blur. No matter how slowly you move the mouse to look around, your vision blurs until you hold the mouse still. Even if you move the mouse just a few milimeters, you get motion blur. This can be incredibly disorienting. I understand that some people like the effect for immersion, but other games like The Forest give the player the option to disable motion blur if it suits them. If the developer for Rake had implemented this option, I would not have bothered mentioning this minor caveat.\n\nThat leads to my final issue with the title - the lack of Settings Options. The only chance you get to tweak anything other than sound and possibly brightness (I've forgotten what the second of the two options are and I've already started the Refund process as of this writing) is when you start the game; a window pops up with resolution, graphics settings and display options. That's it. Once you're in the game, you can only tweak sound effect volune and one other thing. This was incredibly aggravating on my first attempt playing, as I wanted to tweak the graphics settings to try and improve performance. Not being able to do so without rebooting the game was an annoyance that could have been easily avoided.\n\nTo give credit where it's due, the AI for the Rake itself isn't bad, and the jump-scares are pretty effective. It actually managed to get a squeal out of me the first couple of times I saw it. Unfortunately even interactions with this antagonist lack polish. While hunting the Rake, you only have a couple of seconds to react before it's in your face and taking a swipe at you. Once it's close enough to attack, the rifle straight up disappears from your hand and you're completely helpless. You can't run, you can't fight, all you do is stand there and let it smack yo' a$$. This might have been a design choice, meant to indicate the player character being frozen in fear, but if that was the intention there should be more indication of it than the rifle taking a trip to Narnia. Perhaps the character crying out, or at least whimpering and panting.\n\nIf this title were still in Early Access, I would definitely recommend it. Unfortunately, it's not, and as of this writing it still feels very unfinished. That being said, if I had the extra money to blow on a game that annoys me as much as it entertains, I wouldn't have asked for a refund. If you like to support Indie Devs, by all means pick up Rake. If you're like me and in the position where you only afford to buy games that you can get many hours of enjoyment out of, skip it and wait for future titles from Konsordo. I am confiident that given enough time and support, they will produce something great in the future.\n\nTL;DR: Rake is a game with a great concept that lacks polish.

It's still not perfect, it lacks polish and the concept could use some work, but it's creative, original and unique (yes, those all mean different things to me), and you'll be hard pressed to find horror games that are like that in the current market.\n\nIf you consider yourself a fan of horror, or are just someone looking to get a bit spooked and willing to overlook some flaws, you owe it to yourself to try this game out. For it's price, it's more than worth it.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nEDIT: The game's been updated since I wrote my original review, giving the Rake noticibly better AI and improving the game's overall performance a fair bit, which were two of my biggest issues with it at first. Multiplayer, however, is still nowhere in sight and is still announced as a feature in the game's steam page. Until this is added, I'm afraid I can't change the review to a recommend.\n\nThis game isn't early access. I bought it expecting a finished product, and although I'll give some credit to the creator for informing their audience that mutliplayer is still in the works (at the very end of the description), the fact is it seems like they're trying to blatantly misinform their costumers, which is never okay.\n\nI'll edit this review as the game updates.\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\n\nI wish there was a button for "reluctant recommend", because although I'm really liking this game, there's a lot wrong here...\n\nBut first, lets talk about the good!\n\nOriginal concept: A horror game where you're tasked with hunting down and fighting the monster? Yes please!\nBig, open map to explore.\nGood atmosphere.\nMultitude of tools and items.\nIntense moments when fighting the rake.\nPut all of these together, and you have a really solid concept... That is unfortunately bogged down by a multitude of mistakes, such as:\n\nMediocre graphics.\nMediocre sound design.\n♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI: At one point the rake stood still for 15 seconds while I unloaded shots into it.\nBad animations: My character got stuck in animation loops after being attacked by the rake, several times.\nPoorly implemented items: The traps and the camera only go a short way towards helping you fight the rake. In the end, it feels like what you do with them doesn't matter.\nEngrish: The dev is russian, so I have to give them some leeway, but hiring someone to localize the game isn't all that hard - ♥♥♥♥, I'll do it for free! Just so I don't have to put up with the really awkward writing.\nPoor optimization/No multiplayer or coop: Dumping these together because the dev has stated they're planning on fixing it, but as of right now, it's not in the game.\nRake is a solid game with a good foundation behind it. If the dev continues to support it, listents to the community and tries to fix the afformentioned mistakes, then I have great hopes for it. But as it stands... There's better ways to spend your money.\n\nI'll probably change my review if the dev keeps improving on the game.","July 15, 2015","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","13"

My first day in the forest looking for something supernatural, putting 5 useless cameras and getting scared by demonic pigs. As i slept for the day i wondered: What am i going to find out there and then i went to sleep, i woke up and the first thing i did was looking at the cameras and seeing a deer a pig and the rake. He was tall and skinny, as soon as i saw him i knew i could take him on, turns out that 8 shots of my bb gun didnt work. I rushed back to the camper and seeing pigs EATING MY ♥♥♥♥ING FEED WILD AND SCARING ME WITH THEIR ♥♥♥♥ING SCREAMS. I looked out the window and saw the rake just looking at me, with dark eyes that could make even yo mama scream.

Oooh and flares, can't have a horror game set innawoods without some flares\n- The day/night cycle is pretty stale. Having the day visibly change to night would urge the player on far more\n\nAnd that's honestly it. This game is truly what I believe creepypasta games should be, that building dread as you fall further into a story, becoming more invested in finding the truth, and then coming face to face with something horrifying. The rake, while not a very attractive world model, is to this game what the Blair Witch was to that movie, an almost intangible horror lurking JUST out of sight, far enough that you fear even hearing it but not so far that you don't want to stop. Adding dead camers was a masterful touch, it gives the player a choice of braving the unknown in search of the truth, or staying where it's safe and knowing nothing come morning.\n\nAnd when you do decide to venture fourth, my god. The feeling is like those first few minutes of Fatal Frame that I haven't felt since I was twelve. I actually had to stand in the doorway of that trailer, truly apprehensive about going out there. It's like going down a dark halway in your house to see if that noise really was just the dog. You feel true dread, whether it's the sound design that is done VERY well for an indie game (blending the sounds of the Rake with those of the pigs is a key point) or the knowlege that the thing is out there, hunting you, every minute spent in the dark is heart pounding.\n\nThis game is doing for horror what many years of Triple A titles have fallen short and failed to do. It's made it about the story of the monster, the story of the man hunting the thing, and not about just some thing popping out of the dark with a scary face. More than anything, the devs UNDERSTAND that you do not have to see the horror to fear it, only knowing that it is there and it is coming for you. And it's doing all of this with graphics from 2005.\n\nI absolutely CANNOT wait for multiplayer.","July 15, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

I thought to myself as I returned to the caravan after setting up the maximum 5 cameras.\nUpon returning to the caravan I discovered a 'skip day' option and clicked is thusly.\n\nand this is where things get ♥♥♥♥\n\nI spent the first 5 minutes watching my cameras, it was around this time where I got restless as nothing had happened except for a pig walking past camera 5 occaisonally. I spent another 10 minutes watching cameras and got stupidly bored.\nSo I decided to go outside and just look around. Then, in the distance, I saw a figure dart across the horizon.\n\n"♥♥♥♥ing finally, something has actually happened."\n\nI fired 2 warning shots at the creature to which 1 must have hit it because a health bar appeared on the top of the screen.\n\nA. ♥♥♥♥ing. Health. Bar.\n\nThe creature then ran up to me pinned down and struck me once and took a quarter of my health.\nAnd when i say ran I mean awkwardly zig zagged up to me because the bushes/trees seemed to best its sub-par intelligence.\n\nAfter it hit me, I got up and watched it dart off never to see it for the rest of the night.\nI felt like i had been jump scare blue-balled.\n\n\n\n\nA different friend warned me about ♥♥♥♥♥♥ early access horror games on steam, I should have heeded his warning, I urge you to as well.\n","January 3","false","0.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","5","11","3","3"

The poor graphics and syntax-error laden text are excusable. Everything else that's wrong with the game: not so much.\n\nThe creators clearly have vision but lack the talent to see it to fruition. Either that or they're just really lazy. I'm not gonna lie; the concept is really cool but the execution is horroible. The game drops you off in a trailor in the middle of the wilderness without any direction or instruction. (You can find the controls in the setup menu before the game even launches and 3 brief pages of hints found in the main menu give you some vague tips of questionable merit.) Each day you get a new journal entry to read and even if you follow the direction to the letter it's no guarantee that you'll encounter the Rake. So far I can only see it in several locations that trigger scripted actions and give you no opportunity to shoot it (if that is indeed what the objective is) and hanging around camp on the final night. Even if you manage to get a few rounds off before it retreats into the woods, it takes dozens of hits for it to go down. Your ammo is limited so you need pretty high hit-to-miss ratio, which is harder than it sounds because you have no reticle and can't even look down the sights of the gun (the rifle has a scope but you only get 8 shots with that so good luck).\n\nNow let's talk about the cameras: they're worthless. The journal entries stress the importance of setting up cameras to capture footage of the Rake (Is that the objective? Do I even have have to kill it? I really wish the game would let me know) but that doesn't seem to do anything. On the first night, it always takes out two of my cameras. I can see him do it but apparantly getting the video footage isn't actually important after all. You have a map that gives you the locations of all of your cameras, but they're not labeled so good luck figuring out which of the ten or so red marks is the one that the Rake was just at. Oh, yeah, and they all staticy and flicker constantly. I'm sure it's meant to be spooky but all it does is give you a headache.\n\nI bought this game because it promised monsters. Technically it delivered that, but it is far from scary. It's good for a chuckle if you're playing with other people or just showing friends how terrible it is but as a serious game it is among the worst I've ever played. I just hope these can get some better talent in future spooky-monster games because it has potential. This game, however, realizes none of it.","July 23, 2015","false","8.9"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

Until this game was optimized it resembled a half finished painting done by Picasso with his ♥♥♥♥, but after the recent updates, it started looking like a game, something I could engage in some daily foreplay with.

The $5 price tag is mostly justified.  Although the game optimization is pretty crap.  Getting 40 frames on average with a brand new GTX 980 Ti is not what you would expect from a game like this at 1440p on high settings.  The game content is quite limited at the moment with no purpose other than grab your rifle, set cameras up around the woods, and search for the mythical Rake.  If you want to buy a cheap game that will keep you entertained for a few hours, then go ahead and buy this game, it'll certainly do that.

I was playing offline for a couple of days because of faulty interntet, and it did not register for some reason. But anyways, here are some Pros And Cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Creepy, even during the day.\n-Don't even get me started when it's nightime.\n-Camera system, operated from the campervan is a good idea. (Although clearly taking insparation from FNAF.)\n-The Rake can destroy the cameras, and when it does, holy sh*t.\n-The Rake climbs trees and jumps from them.\n-Camera on the pig is hilarious.\n\nAnd that's about it...\n\nCONS:\n\n-Poorly optimized. I have a below average laptop yet CS:GO runs better. (And that has much better graphics, more on that now.)\n-Graphics are very poor. On "Very Low" settings, the grass is comepletely gone, and albeit the game is colourful, it definently needs colour correction. It is overall way too bright and staturated.\n-Cameras can only be placed on set locations. This HUGELY dissapointed me. And the locations were you can place them are not varied enough, there are roughly 4 cameras that you can place near your camp, and like, 20 to the north-east of the map.\n-Scripted encounters during the day and night, but only in a couple of locations, which are scary but feel too cheap.\n-The Rake looks terrible. He resembles nothing like the Creepypasta version, and needs spike arms! That would already be a good improvement. It's texture is very poor, which makes it less scary.\n-When you kill it, literrally all you receive is a "You Win!" message at the top of the screen.\n-HUD is below average, but nothing terrible.\n-Decent price, but the map is not randomly or proccedurally generated, therefore you get the same experience every time you play.\n-No tutorial.\n\nAnd the thing that bothers me the most has got to be:\n\n=STOCK ASSETS FROM THE UNITY ENGINE. STOCK ASSETS FOR F*CKS SAKE. If you are going to MAKE a game, do NOT, I repeat DO NOT use stock assets! ARE YOU CRAZY?! That is litterally one of the most lazy things that you can do when making a game.\n\nSorry about the rant.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAt this point, unfortunatly I simply cannot recommend the game. It's poor grahics, very low replayability and no tutorial to speak of, and of course, *Ahem*, STOCK ASSETS, I see no good reasons to give this game, a thumbs up. Devs, to improve, give this game a couple of months, work on a big update, and then I'll review it again.\n\nSCORE: 5/10   = Half baked =","August 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I was playing offline for a couple of days because of faulty interntet, and it did not register for some reason. But anyways, here are some Pros And Cons.\n\nPROS:\n\n-Creepy, even during the day.\n-Don't even get me started when it's nightime.\n-Camera system, operated from the campervan is a good idea. (Although clearly taking insparation from FNAF.)\n-The Rake can destroy the cameras, and when it does, holy sh*t.\n-The Rake climbs trees and jumps from them.\n-Camera on the pig is hilarious.\n\nAnd that's about it...\n\nCONS:\n\n-Poorly optimized. I have a below average laptop yet CS:GO runs better. (And that has much better graphics, more on that now.)\n-Graphics are very poor. On "Very Low" settings, the grass is comepletely gone, and albeit the game is colourful, it definently needs colour correction. It is overall way too bright and staturated.\n-Cameras can only be placed on set locations. This HUGELY dissapointed me. And the locations were you can place them are not varied enough, there are roughly 4 cameras that you can place near your camp, and like, 20 to the north-east of the map.\n-Scripted encounters during the day and night, but only in a couple of locations, which are scary but feel too cheap.\n-The Rake looks terrible. He resembles nothing like the Creepypasta version, and needs spike arms! That would already be a good improvement. It's texture is very poor, which makes it less scary.\n-When you kill it, literrally all you receive is a "You Win!" message at the top of the screen.\n-HUD is below average, but nothing terrible.\n-Decent price, but the map is not randomly or proccedurally generated, therefore you get the same experience every time you play.\n-No tutorial.\n\nAnd the thing that bothers me the most has got to be:\n\n=STOCK ASSETS FROM THE UNITY ENGINE. STOCK ASSETS FOR F*CKS SAKE. If you are going to MAKE a game, do NOT, I repeat DO NOT use stock assets! ARE YOU CRAZY?! That is litterally one of the most lazy things that you can do when making a game.\n\nSorry about the rant.\n\nConclusion:\n\nAt this point, unfortunatly I simply cannot recommend the game. It's poor grahics, very low replayability and no tutorial to speak of, and of course, *Ahem*, STOCK ASSETS, I see no good reasons to give this game, a thumbs up. Devs, to improve, give this game a couple of months, work on a big update, and then I'll review it again.\n\nSCORE: 5/10   = Half baked =","August 7, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

It's actually kind of fun. The sound effects are a bit cheesy (one ambient sound is just like some guy yelling into the mic), but kind of gets tense when you hear that little ♥♥♥♥er scampering towards you and you get your crappy two round shotgun ready. I have to say if the game was fleshed out more, bigger area, more to explore, more equipment to use they might actually got something here. If they can make a multiplayer game out of this that's not just co-op and has someone player the rake terrorizing other players? They will definitely have something.

Picked it up today and enjoed playing throug the first game. The camera system is great , if a little bit janky when your watching the footage. The feeling of being exposed and hunted is great and the gun feels unweildly as it would do in the hands of some guy who isnt a trained soldier. Some more variety, new maps or monsters would be good.\nSome points I picked up on:\n1- The monster is very fast but does very little damage so it doesnt 'feel' like a threat once it gets you.\n2- The first pig kept going into the trap ( not sure if intentional)\n3- The monster can be predicable\n4- The constant flickering of the cameras is unwatchable after a while, the flicker is fine once ever so often but its all the time.\n\nCan I request you put some Lore or story into the game, even just fluff text on the board or diarys in the woods, and as I said new areas would be great! I think a haunted house level would be awesome!\nWould it be possible for lets say a point system or something as a 'goal' to aim for, to gather evidence on the monster? or something......\n\nAnyway I just want to say well done and this is a great game, you are obviously very talented game dev's and I look forward to more content in the future!\n\n","July 15, 2015","true","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I also am looking forward to MP but im scared whoever plays the rake will just camp on the trailer,wait till the other player comes out and then smap attack them till they die.As a MASSIVE creepypasta fan i immediatly bought this game and do i thnk it's worth it? if he iron's out alot of the issues and can add more content to it such as the creature update or have the first game you buy be $5 and the rest be as dlc for the price of $1 and be added in the menu,then YES the athmosphere is spot on and i almost jumped out of my chair once which horror games rarely make me do,also one last thing iron sights for the rifle or shotgun would be nice to it can help alot of us aim.

I love the idea of hunting the monster with some simple gadgets. I can already see the graphics aren't the best and the gameplay mechanics are very simplistic. Those aren't the problem. The game is only five dollars anyway.\n\nTHE BIG PROBLEM.\n\nThe AI is literally too easy. The pigs and deers were harder to kill and hit than the actual Rake. The Rake will jog towards you and you can hear it a mile away. Just aim and shoot and it scatters off in the distance for a few seconds. Then it comes jogging back. Repeat, and repeat and it dies. So... Hopefully they can fix the AI or improve it, or something. Otherwise I can't recommend it. It didn't even jump in the trees or anything. That is my biggest problem with the game. The AI is a bore. If they patch it or improve it within this game, I will certaintly recommend this game.\n\nAs of now, it's a no. <-- OLD\n\nEDIT*\n\nThe developers are working on this, I guess. There's no major co-op mode yet, or multiplayer. I can say that the game is much better if you play it like this: Night 1 don't go hunting, Day 2 go sight seeing, Night 3 fight!\n\nI had a lot of fun editing this video that I made, this game is only five dollars (Still 2 dollars more than what I think it should be worth) and has some interesting ideas. The AI has improved a little bit, but would still like to see a lot of changes since this game does have quite a bit of potential. Would I recommend this? Sure, if you like making YouTube videos.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-49aTvmToc","July 17, 2015","true","2.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept of walking around at night, setting up cameras to try to get a glimpse of an illusive cryptid is an incredibly compelling premise. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Playing this game gives you a strong sense of the potential it has, and at the same time makes you understand how much potential has been unrealized. It simply isn't polished enough to be considered a good game, and the implementation of multiplayer is a buggy mess that usually guarantees a player will desync from the game entirely, making it unplayable.

(26/10/15)\n\nI'm going to go out on a limb, and recommend Rake its by a baw-hair mind you. Why you may ask? Even if you should understand that its gameplay can be like marmite you'll ether find it a fresh take on low-brow horror or a broken mess that has a interesting concept that hasn't really been pulled off. Waiting for action is more unnerving than seeing him. Two play styles to take note off; wait for him or try and find him. I suggest staying in the camper van like a big girls blouse, I think its safe there?\n\nThe lore about the Rake would be best researched online if you want a back story? To me, the games like trying to catch the neighbourhood vandal that dumps on your front lawn, where as you take part in a sort of a over the top hightech neighourhood watch scheme with a shotgun to catch the dirty naked bum or a neighour dispute thats run on for years and is very bitter would be another way of looking at it. There are two things in this world he (the Rake) hates more than you; one is the poor quality jumpy cameras and number two is pigs, in fact later he uses them to decorate your camper van and in general express itself with like a true artisan.\n\nOn a purely techical point, I've had no issues. I've yet to use my old all-in-one but on the gaming PC with a GTX 970, i7 4790k 4GHZ, 16GB RAM its not broke a sweat at all with max settings. Looking at the sceenshots it shouldn't be taxing anyway! its not ARK nor Metro:lastlight. [edit] Getting back to the old ideacentre i3 3GHZ, AMD HD 6400, 4GB RAM. I can play it at 720, windowed, low settings for around 20fps I'll let you wonder if that is acceptable? Afterall a i3 with a AMD 6400 GPU isn't for anything other than light gaming.\n\nIts not all strawberries and cream, mutiplayer will only be LAN. Also can't comment on lan mutiplayer anyway as it will be coming in the next update. The online heros of the Devs are using excuses of using other software to by pass Lan only for online play. I can't think of the last time I've bothered/needed to do so, nor any developer that thinks its desirable nowadays. The more you play the AI has large flaws and gets to a point where you can easy cheat the game by blocking doorways with traps. Also they are already working on Rake 2 :S Shameless if you ask me. Konsordo also don't have a stella rep even if they seem to have got a winner in the eyes of a few here. For its price thou £3.99, its a interesting take on monster hunting it should offer a good few hours of gameplay IF you can bypass flaws that outside a indie -B movie horror game just wouldn't fly.","July 15, 2015","true","4.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But for others i would have to say the asking price is likely to go up in the case of an addition with multiplayer. in the end i can give this game a 7/10 while being a little boring at times but a full 8/10 if the multiplayer is going to be anything like i imagine.","August 3, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept of walking around at night, setting up cameras to try to get a glimpse of an illusive cryptid is an incredibly compelling premise. The execution, however, leaves a lot to be desired. Playing this game gives you a strong sense of the potential it has, and at the same time makes you understand how much potential has been unrealized. It simply isn't polished enough to be considered a good game, and the implementation of multiplayer is a buggy mess that usually guarantees a player will desync from the game entirely, making it unplayable. I could only recommend this game for what it could be someday in the future, but I have no faith that the developer intends to smooth the rough edges this game has. I would love to be proven wrong, but until that happens I cannot recommend this game.","February 13","false","2.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played for a while (and plan to play more to see coop and some more stuff). But most scary part wasn't when fighting rake or when he screamed at my camera right after switching on, but when i shot deer ,literally sound he made should be one that our monster enemy do, it was freaking abnormal.\nCameras are pretty pointless because thay get destroyed all the time and give you no advantage, why quality of that is so bad why it doesnt record only stream it would be cool to watch video to see what happened or what you missed , pig camera is cool but rather not too useful.\nI did like the atmosphere,sadly as long as night 3 didn't came. Not only there where no expecting for attack or anything it simply spawned right before car and start walking around it . All i could see in reviews was "great game - fear night 3 ". O_O I wanted massacre- i got cosplay joke.At least if he could interact with our safehouse like hit it try reaching you in some way or just stay and stare at you through window or hanging up side down from roof side (that would be creepy - dolan is watching) Anyway i simply walked out of my van and looked out for our monster, and nothing beyond my car getting more and more bloodsoaked were actually creepy. Rake walking animations made me laugh, model looked like 60s stereotype movie alien not horrific malformed humanoid being that i had expected and from what i noticed he didn't tried getting into car or anything he does can grab you through window but thats all. When i shot him i took him like (1/40 ?)HP and i though oh well he wasn't scary but at least he is tough and i need tactic because he probably will one hit me .... and again - nope he stroke me or grabed or whatever, our MC fall to ground, screen is red and nothing more he get up red glow disappear and we go on with little less health. More like fear stepping on own trap- this ♥♥♥♥ takes like half of your HP.

And It's way too boring when you don't see the rake, even when you see it it's unsatifying.\n\nAge Rating: E\n\nOverall Rating: 2/10\nThe game is a poorly made attempt at a horror game to cash in on the Slender craze.

I expected it to be a scary, good executed game like Slender, since they're both based on Creepypastas. Sadly, this game came nowhere near good.\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but each day takes an hour. A real hour. In real life. If you want to go through a whole day, good luck. You can sleep during the day, but not during the night, as you need to hunt down Rake.\nDuring the day, you set up cameras and traps. At night, you look at those cameras, with gameplay stolen straight form Five Night's at Freddy's. I'm not a fan of FNAF, and even if you are a fan of it, this game is still boring. You sit there for thrity minutes, doing absoltely nothing, but staring at nothing. At least in FNAF, there were other things you had to keep track of, and the animatronics were a constant threat.\nOf course, if you choose to go outside to find Rake, things get a little more interesting. The dark amospher and creepy sound effects are well done. You will get scared at the sound of footsteps, thinking it's Rake, but it's a boar. It's fun and creepy. Until you actually see Rake. Since the graphics aren't the greatest, he doesn't look all that intimidating. And he follows the same attack pattern every time. You can easily take him down if you figure it out.\nThe nights would actually be okay if you could do something else. This game should've had more survival gameplay. You don't need to get food, or drink water, or pretty much do anything. All you have is a health bar. At night, all you can do is stare at cameras for a boring time, walk outside for a little fun, or walk around your claustrophobic mobile home. You can't cook any food to eat, drink water, or anything fun.\n2/10 Slenderman is better, and it's free. If this game was free, it might've gone up to a 3/10","August 10, 2015","false","0.5"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","29","2","7","0","0"

The rake also seems to have somekind of problem because its not scary and it jumpscares you alot which pisses you off. Only point where i experienced true horror is when i realised i wasted all that money buying this.\n\nWhen you manage to catch the rake and shoot it to the face nothing happens, he just knocks you to the ground and dont even have the balls to finish you off so you have to repeat this repeative process all over again and again and again, until you shut down the game and never return.\n\nI dont care about graphics but in this game they are awfull, depressing and poison to your eyes. The graphics are so good that when i discovered the "swamp" i though it was somekind of radioactive waste toxic dump. Everything in this game is awfull and depressing, expect those cute wildboars which you can equip with cameras.\n\nI bought this game because i must have had somekind of minor stroke in my brain at that time.\n3 cheeseburgers from mcdonalds would have been the better value than this game.\n5/5 would never play again.","February 15","false","1.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

The rake also seems to have somekind of problem because its not scary and it jumpscares you alot which pisses you off. Only point where i experienced true horror is when i realised i wasted all that money buying this.\n\nWhen you manage to catch the rake and shoot it to the face nothing happens, he just knocks you to the ground and dont even have the balls to finish you off so you have to repeat this repeative process all over again and again and again, until you shut down the game and never return.\n\nI dont care about graphics but in this game they are awfull, depressing and poison to your eyes. The graphics are so good that when i discovered the "swamp" i though it was somekind of radioactive waste toxic dump. Everything in this game is awfull and depressing, expect those cute wildboars which you can equip with cameras.\n\nI bought this game because i must have had somekind of minor stroke in my brain at that time.\n3 cheeseburgers from mcdonalds would have been the better value than this game.\n5/5 would never play again.","February 15","false","1.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","20","1","5","0","0"

I'll play it again differently now that I've read the "Help" section, but a couple of things I think could make it better just on first impressions:\n\n1) A hardcore mode or some such, where you can only take two hits at best, and the monster can only take a few as well. This might be just first impressions and maybe the traps do a tonne of damage, but the fear of the monster is lessened a lot by the lack of damage. Another reviewer said they lost half their health from a single hit, but I was only losing about a 10th at most, which sucked the sense of fear away a lot. Same with the monster-- shooting it in the face at point-blank range should do substantial damage to it. Maybe it could regain some health after the night.The mode would also not end after 3 nights, but keep going until one of you is dead. I would really love a mode like that, but it's just a suggestion.\n\n2) You should probably move slower when aiming your gun.\n\n3) Crouching. Even if it didn't do anything, it feels like it should be there.\n\n4 The cameras are a little bit too annoying. Maybe the further away the cameras are placed, the more distorted they should get.","November 19, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a little fun, wrapped in a bun. And well the game i small, so is the asking price! It revolves around placing cameras to track a beast: the "Rake". There are actually two of this creature. The map is large filled with secrets like hunting shelters, dens of animals, and just plain easter eggs. It does, however, get a bit repetitive. The promise of multiplayer and beautiful graphics make this lil' game worthwhile.","August 1, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'v always been a huge fan of supernatural things and cryptids so I knew I had to try this. And boy, I don't regret that one bit. The camera system is really well made, the creature can be terrifying and the nights make your heart race. This game has A LOT of potential, (not that it isn't good already) but as this gets updated more and more I believe this game will eventually shine.\n\nWhen I started playing, I wasn't too impressed by the enviorment and the sounds, but when nighttime came, all that changed. I became so immersed and and frightened that I wasn't able to leave the truck at all. And when I finally did, the Rake is god damn terrifying. It's so dark at nights, and the Rake is so fast and unpredictable that those 2 things combined make the nights all out horror at least for me.\n\nAll and all this game is definitely worth the 4€.

It's an OK game in some ways. The only good part about it was the end game, and one part where I found the sniper and I kept shooting the monster till I ran out of ammo and had to leg it back to my RV in the dark. It isn't really scary more or less annoying, since the monster just runs up, decks you, then hauls ♥♥♥ away. The main reason I played this game was because you could put cameras on pigs and watch them be hunted. Besides that game play is boring and clunky. The only "Horror" aspect of the game is the first time the monster hits you and you're not expecting it, the feeling you get at night is a little unnerving until you realize you can just stay in the RV like a little ♥♥♥♥♥ and let PigCam do all the work. To describe it quickly. Think fnaf meets Cabelas Dangerous Hunts 2011 (The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one where you end up shooting monkeys throwing grenades at you in africa) Despite all the flaws this game has it has multiple fun moments be it shooting from you're windows like a drunk redneck farmer protecting his favourite sex pig, or wandering through the woods in the dark like 90% of awful horror movie characters.","July 23, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think one of the reasons I complain about the nights being to long is because Im ready for the relaxing day. But seriously, the nights are too long. The character has too much health, and the rake has too much health (after you see how little his health declines after being shot it kind of goes from "terror" to "slight annoyance".\n\nBut this game has so much potential and really is amazing for the small cheap game that it is.

Despite the brightness being too high (and hardly any game options so you can't fix it easily), daytime being extremely saturated, and nothing happening most of the time... It still manages to be terrifying.  At least at first.  Most horror games rely on jump scares and constant danger (Outlast) but this game takes a completely different approach.  Now it's just you watching nighttime cameras and not knowing what, if anything, will happen.  The tension this creates is incredible... At least until you start getting bored.\nIn the end there isn't really much content yet and even when you do see the creature you'll probably be disappointed.  It's not the worst creature in a game but it doesn't match the sheer tension that has built up by the time you see it.  Disappointing really.  Once you learn how the game works and how the enemy behaves, the game becomes incredibly simple.\n\nOverall I see a ton of potential here.  Enhance the enemy AI a bit, make it better animated (and get better textures if you can), and find something for the player to do during the long hours of the night when they eventually get bored.  As of right now it's fun for about an hour then gets stale, but it's also very early access and, in my opinion, worth every cent they're asking for it.  If you enjoy slow paced open-world type horror games, give this a shot.\n\nNOTE:  Below is my story, it's long.  You've been warned.\n\nDay One: It's bright out... Really bright.  Like bad hangover bright.  Other than that the place looks nice enough.  Plenty of gear lying around in the trailer I arrived in so I collect as much as I can and decide to head out and explore.  Five steps outside the trailer and a pig from hell comes darting out of the bushes squealing, probably laughing at my now soiled pants.  Oh well.  Onward!  After placing five cameras near my base I realize there really isn't much to do and if the HUD is correct I still have 25 real life minutes of daylight.  I explore a little bit but am excited to get to the meat of the game so I head back to the trailer and sleep until night.\n\nNight One:  It's dark out and I'm already nervous.  Turn on the camera feed to take a look at what is going on only to realize that Camera 5 is already out somehow.  Did it go out in the day and I just didn't notice?  Or is something already out there?  I spend a full minute trying to work up the courage before finally blasting out my front door with shotgun in hand and running to where the camera was.  Surprisingly it wasn't as dark as I had thought, I could see well enough without the crappy little flashlight I had, but that didn't make me feel much better.  Upon arriving I saw that the camera was indeed gone but didn't hear or see anything else.  No sign of what had taken the camera out in the first place.  After standing there surveying the area for a few seconds I quickly replaced the camera then booked it back to the trailer, slamming the door as quickly as I could.  No idea why I got spooked, but I could feel a chill running down my spine from my little excursion.  Not a bad start.\nI finally get back to the camera feed and began switching through the cameras.  Camera 1 kept sensing motion and blinking at me thanks to a pig that kept getting caught in a trap near my camper but everything else was quiet.  Saw a few pigs on the cameras but nothing else.\nTen minutes later I begin to get bored so pull out my phone to watch a Youtube video but make sure to keep an eye on the camera sensors in case anything happens.  Nothing.  Ten minutes left at night and nothing happened.  Starting to feel less tense and with the video over, I start switching through the cameras to try and learn the layout of the land better before I explore tomorrow.\nFour minutes later I switch over to Camera 5 again and hear footsteps just out of viewing range.  Probably a pig again, but I decided to wait until it came into view.... About five seconds later the footsteps turn into running and my heart skips a beat.  Moments later the camera goes offline as some ungodly scream fills the audio.\nI don't know if it was stupidity or courage but I decided to go out and find this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ while I still could, now that I knew where it was.  After sitting around for 24 minutes I needed SOMETHING to do.\nEquipping my shotgun I begin sprinting through the woods, too scared to look around me for fear that the damn thing will jump out at any second.  Upon arriving at the site of Camera 5 I don't see anything but I do hear footsteps further up the path.  I quickly replace the camera then slowly proceed up the path, trying to see what is making the noise.  About halfway up the path I hear the footsteps turn into running.  Running in my direction.  I quickly bring up the shotgun and aim in the direction it's coming from, unsure what to expect...\nAnd then I see it, a horribly animated and textured creature rapidly waddles out of the bushes before I blast it point blank range in the face.  A second later it's running off already, scared off apparently.  Fight or flight kicks in and I decide that fight is the best option, so I follow it.  Turns out the Rake is one of the loudest walking creatures on Earth (actually most creatures in the game are) so it's easy to follow.\nI keep a clear area between me and it so I won't get caught by surprise in the underbrush, but otherwise am able to follow it easily.  After about tens seconds of chasing I hear it stop and return to normal walking speed, seems it finally calmed down.  I slow myself as well and carefully approach, trying to keep to open areas as much as possible.  Sure enough, I start hearing it run for me again and so I do what I did before, I wait.  Soon as it appears I fire again and off it runs.  Now it's become a game, with only a few minutes left.  I begin chasing it all over the map, firing as soon as it gets close then chasing after it.  No longer is this a horror game, now it's a funny game of tag.\nUnfortunately the time runs out and instead of the sun coming up I get teleported back to my trailer.  Almost had the bugger too...  I had been hit once that night as he ran by me in a panic but my health was still pretty high so I considered the night an overall success.  Now to hope that he wouldn't heal during the daytime.\n\nDay Two:  Exploring.  That's mostly what I did.  I found a few dead pigs (some with their heads on spikes) and a lot of old buildings and hunting stands.  Stumbled across one building where the Rake was apparently hiding out and got hit again as he took off out the door.  Scared the ♥♥♥♥ out of me but I was more disappointed that I hadn't gotten a shot off than anything else.  Health still looked good, about 80%.  Nothing to worry about.  More exploring yielded an area where FPS dropped down into the single digits, some ammo, traps, and a sniper rifle.  Not a bad haul.\n\nNight Two: Now the game begins again.  I'm watching the monitors just to see where he comes from this time, hopefully it doesn't take all night.  About five minutes in I'm watching Camera 4, one that has a great view of a large open clearing near a lake.  I must have great timing, because I hear footsteps and a second later I spot him approaching the camera.  I wait until he breaks into a run to attack the camera before I exit the feed and take off after him.  No need to replace the camera now, this ends tonight.  After a ten minute game of tag I finally land the final shot on him with my trusty shotgun and am rewarded with "You win!" on the top of my screen.  I should feel victorious, but honestly I feel a bit dirty.  The Rake wasn't really much of a threat after all, and learning his pattern so easily made the game a breeze.  Perhaps future updates will change this.  Perhaps he will become a true threat some day.  One can only hope.","July 17, 2015","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/OtterA/recommended/386880/","OtterA","The Semp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/OtterA/","660 products in account","Camera 5 just went offline and I didn't even see it happen. The monster works fast. Fast enough that a few moments later my pig-mounted camera shuts off as well. This time I switch over just in time to watch it lunge. By now I have a pretty good idea of where The Rake is roaming tonight, so I grab my gun and prepare to hunt the beast down...\n\nTL;DR at bottom\n\nThere are many out there who feel that the "found footage" genre of film popularized by Paranormal Activity and Marble Hornets is played out and tired. I do not count myself as one of those people. One thing that, to me, is pretty incredible about Rake is that I kind of feel like the guy holding the camera in a found footage film.\n\nLet me start out by saying you're not randomly trapped somewhere collecting pages for reasons unknown. This is a horror game where you have set out to find the creature in question, and you didn't come empty handed. The bread and butter of the game is the ability to set up cameras which you can watch from your base camp. They rotate at your command, and can be put in a number of different places, and even attached to the back of a live pig. The restriction on the system is that you can only place five cameras at a time, and they aren't invincible. The Rake will go out of his way to destroy hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of your equipment. ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou also have a gun. This is a monster that can be killed if you're smart and fast enough. It's not easy, but it's possible.\n\nThere's a pattern that I quickly fell into as I played. During the day I set up cameras and traps galore, and when night falls  I monitor the cameras and wait for the beasty to show himself. As soon as he does, I take my trusty shotgun and begin the hunt for the creature. Oftentimes, it feels more like the creature is hunting me. I haven't reached an end state yet, but the gameplay is unique enough where I want to keep trying to best my supernatural foe.\n\nA walking simulator this game is not, which is a relief since most creepypasta based games function in that way. Story takes a back seat here, which is fine since it allows you to make your own stories.\n\nThere are some drawbacks I feel inclined to mention. The camera system feels like a missed opportunity. It's not terrible, but you're limited to a select number of trees and angles. I would love to see in the future an update that allows me to mount a camera just about anywhere, as it would make the gameplay far more dynamic. The graphics of the monster are mediocre up close, as it kind of looks like you're being attacked by an even smaller and skinnier Gollum. When it's fully dark and he's sprinting through the brush towards you he's pretty scary, but in the off-chance you encounter him during the day you're likely to shake your head a bit.\n\nCurrently there's only one map with static elements. Either a couple more maps or a procedural generation element to it would be extremely welcome. The game is rather inexpensive, and you get what you paid for, but it's just exciting to think what this game has the potential to be.\n\nI'd like to note that I'm rather impressed with Rake's AI for both the monster and the wildlife. I've been scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at night by a boar more than once, and The Rake is pretty good about making sure you only catch fleeting glimpses of him.

The grammer in the game could also be worked on a bit more because I spotted a few grammer errors in the journal and also interacting with things such as placing cameras on trees when you hit the limit of cameras placed. The ambient sounds are amazing in-game and can sometimes warn you that something might happen if you continue on the path you're following. I also liked the shaky cameras when viewing them because it makes it more horrifying looking at the cameras and watching the rake take it down. Although it felt really ironic because at the end, (SPOILER ALERT) you were actually trying to hunt and kill the rake before the rake killed you.\nI'd have to rate the game an 8/10 because it is one of the most scariest games I've ever played. for an early access game, it's pretty fun exploring the map and discovering new places (keep in mind, the rake can show up during day time). I'm also really hyped for multiplayer because it will allow one player to play as the rake and mess around with the hunters (which can be pretty fun). I do hope that they implement random world generations in the future updates so that players will have a new experience every time they start off fresh.\nOverall, the game is worth $5.49 and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hunting and horror games.","July 21, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's terrifying as ♥♥♥♥. I thought wandering around a forest was supposed to be peaceful, like Minecraft, but oh no. If you thought Slender or The Forest was the scariest time you can have in the woods, you were all wrong. In the day it's fun to hunt deer and pigs, and place some cameras. You say to your self, "This can't be that bad! I have a rifle!" Then night strikes and you're thrown into an endless darkness of terror. The eyes of the Rake and the other animals that inhabit these woods all look the same, so when a deer walks by a camera, you have a startling moment when you don't realize it's just a Bambi's mom. I say Bambi's mom, because, much like the story of Bambi, that deer dies. But instead of a hunter killing it, it's a scary ♥♥♥ claw beast. And finally when you've got used to the deer, and are no longer scared to switch cameras, the rake jumps at the screen and the camera's dead. The next day comes 30 minutes later, and you finally think you're safe. You head down to a strange church-like building on the edge of the map. There's a sniper rifle. Then, from the ceiling, the Rake jumps down on you, slashes your face, and runs off. And that's pretty much the game. Rainy nights, cloudy days, and the Rake. Unfortunately, multiplayer (as of this review) has not been added yet, but when it is, I can't wait to kill off my friends by locking them outside.","July 21, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The monster works fast. Fast enough that a few moments later my pig-mounted camera shuts off as well. This time I switch over just in time to watch it lunge. By now I have a pretty good idea of where The Rake is roaming tonight, so I grab my gun and prepare to hunt the beast down...\n\nTL;DR at bottom\n\nThere are many out there who feel that the "found footage" genre of film popularized by Paranormal Activity and Marble Hornets is played out and tired. I do not count myself as one of those people. One thing that, to me, is pretty incredible about Rake is that I kind of feel like the guy holding the camera in a found footage film.\n\nLet me start out by saying you're not randomly trapped somewhere collecting pages for reasons unknown. This is a horror game where you have set out to find the creature in question, and you didn't come empty handed. The bread and butter of the game is the ability to set up cameras which you can watch from your base camp. They rotate at your command, and can be put in a number of different places, and even attached to the back of a live pig. The restriction on the system is that you can only place five cameras at a time, and they aren't invincible. The Rake will go out of his way to destroy hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of your equipment. ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou also have a gun. This is a monster that can be killed if you're smart and fast enough. It's not easy, but it's possible.\n\nThere's a pattern that I quickly fell into as I played. During the day I set up cameras and traps galore, and when night falls  I monitor the cameras and wait for the beasty to show himself. As soon as he does, I take my trusty shotgun and begin the hunt for the creature. Oftentimes, it feels more like the creature is hunting me. I haven't reached an end state yet, but the gameplay is unique enough where I want to keep trying to best my supernatural foe.\n\nA walking simulator this game is not, which is a relief since most creepypasta based games function in that way. Story takes a back seat here, which is fine since it allows you to make your own stories.\n\nThere are some drawbacks I feel inclined to mention. The camera system feels like a missed opportunity. It's not terrible, but you're limited to a select number of trees and angles. I would love to see in the future an update that allows me to mount a camera just about anywhere, as it would make the gameplay far more dynamic. The graphics of the monster are mediocre up close, as it kind of looks like you're being attacked by an even smaller and skinnier Gollum. When it's fully dark and he's sprinting through the brush towards you he's pretty scary, but in the off-chance you encounter him during the day you're likely to shake your head a bit.\n\nCurrently there's only one map with static elements. Either a couple more maps or a procedural generation element to it would be extremely welcome. The game is rather inexpensive, and you get what you paid for, but it's just exciting to think what this game has the potential to be.\n\nI'd like to note that I'm rather impressed with Rake's AI for both the monster and the wildlife. I've been scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at night by a boar more than once, and The Rake is pretty good about making sure you only catch fleeting glimpses of him. He's animated pretty well too, which helps sell the experience more.\n\nTL;DR: I've been so tired of the corridor walking simulators that pass as horror games these days. This is the first game in a while I've played that throws wrinkles in the formula, and that in its own right is commendable.

Day one and two was absolutely awesome. It was horrifying and really well made. Day three however was a huge disappointment. The next part describes why.\n\nIt started fairly predicaple. My cameras went out fast and my pet pig had died. That was all fine and dandy until the actualy rake shows up. Then the situation transforms itself into a "boss battle" with him. To get him out of the forest you need to get out and set up cameras. After that you go to your computer and look at the camera. When the rake runs up to the camera you run out with your rifle and shoot him. Now repeat that 20 to 30 times or so. It gets boring really fast. Sure the first time it is a little horrifying as he can smash your window and use some sort of orb to transport pigs with but that only happens the first time. The rest is just the process over and over. I killed myself with a trap because it was so boring.\n\nThat is my biggest problem with the game. Day one and two is well worth it's price.

Well, the true part is that your character is on a quest to discover the truth behind anomalous events/creatures - do these events exist/are these creatures real?, etc.\n\nYou have a number of motion activated trap cameras at your disposal that you can place on trees and even wild pigs (giggles like a little girl) that will aid you in finding your mother-i....er......the 'creature' once night falls.  You can also set feed and bear traps to aid you as well.  Thankfully you can skip the day segments and get right to the good stuff.  Now for the real problem with this game: the creature, or Gibbering Alien Man-Child (GAM-C) as I like to refer to it, takes 5,000 shotty rounds and/or bear trap encounters to kill it.  Ok, so it doesn't take quite that much damage.....but it is truly absurd just how much damage it actually does take.  I mean seriously, a couple well-placed shots to the head with your shotgun (yeah, I said shotty earlier though they call it a rifle in the game - it clearly is a shotgun, though there is apparently a rifle at some point, at least in multiplayer maybe...don't know, haven't played this game too much) should do the trick bu apparently the developers wanted to make this thing more difficult than Patriarch in Killing Floor on HoE difficulty.\n\nRegardless, it's a pretty fun game and using the cameras and waiting breathlessly for the GAM-C to appear can be quite fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itamis/recommended/386880/","itamis","DrShikura","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itamis/","112 products in account","Okay, so. This game is still receiving updates even though it isn't Early Access any longer. As far as a full game goes, it's not the best experience in the world, but I would pay $5 for it. Fortunately for me, I got it on sale day before yesterday for $2.49.\n\nI spent a few short hours in this game before I had been given the peak experience of the game. You play as a scientist in the mountain forests. There's wild boars and deer wandering around the map to add some life to the world. Although, they don't do much. The boars may wander into a trap at your camp which will allow you to place a camera on their heads to track their movements while they wander around the woods.\n\nYou can place up to 5 cameras in the woods, equipped with moton sensors to track the movements of both wildlife and The Rake within view. This is nice, but watching cameras can be almost unbearably annoying at times due to the amount of "flickering" the cameras do. It's like an older VCR effect where the screen has some horizontal splicing. If it happened less often, I would be much happier with the camera system.\n\nThe Rake was creepy enough for the first few hours and he has a tendency of sneaking up on me, which provided some mild jumpscares. However, what I've seen of his AI turned out to seem a little bland. The Rake seems to wander the woods idly until he spots a reason to come after you or run away. I was able to find a deer stand overlooking an open swamp. It was there, I waited for two nights with my shotgun and sniper rifle. The Rake would wander aimlessly into the open where I would shoot him and he would either run away or sprint towrds me until I shot him a second time. Every time I did this, within two minutes, he would come back for more.\n\nDeer Stands are a nifty feature, providing the player "Invisibility" to The Rake's eyesight. However, I'm not sure how The Rake interacts with players while they are within the safety of a deer stand. I don't know if I'm ever going to see The Rake while I'm in a deer stand because I don't know if he walks in my direction while I'm standing in one. Making it almost frustrating to stand in one and wait for him.\n\nYou have the ability to pick up animal feed and traps in the world. You can access them in your inventory and place them on the ground for an added "hunting" effect. However, these features seem rather unpolished, ad boars will completely ignore the feed and I've yet to see The Rake go after any of my animal feed piles. Once I get The Rake to walk over one of my traps, I will deem my experience with Rake complete.\n\nShould you pay $5 for this game? I'd say it's up to you. Different people may receive different experiences with the game depending on how they play, so the game could not be worth the $5, while others will find it worth more than $5. I would say, as far as $5 goes, it's worth the experience, as short lived as it is, because this game is multiplayer and is still being updated. Who knows what will change in the future? I've provided a list of pros and cons I experienced while playing this game. Features I liked, versus qualms I had with existing features of the game. I won't include features that aren't included because they may not be in the game for good reason. (Jumping, crouching, etc.)\n\n===Pros===\n-The ability to view cameras and track the movements nearby your camp without actually going outside.\n-Cameras detect motion, so the buttons on your screen will turn red when something enters view.\n-You can place traps and feed down to "attract" animals and The Rake.\n-The binoculars and sniper scope are well-made and, when used with your flashlight, can be used with a sort of night vision effect.\n-The Game has good atmosphere, with an array of wildlife and ambiance scattered throughout the woods.\n-The jumpscares are enjoyable. Not too obvious, not too weak.\n-The game escalates well over 3 days as The Rake gets progressively more aggressive each night.\n\n===Cons===\n-Camera screens flicker so much, it makes them very annoying to watch. If you can decipher what you're looking at, it still makes it very hard to see.\n-The motion sensors on the camera are very sensitive. They were picking up things that were very far away from view or that I couldn't see at all.\n-The animal feed doesn't seem to work as advertised, as far as my experience has shown.\n-With animal feed not seeming to work, traps may very well be utterly useless as they are right now.\n-The Rake AI seems to wanter aimlessly, seeking out any excuse to attack the player. It's as though his soul reason for existing is to scrape your knees, judging by the amount of damage he does.\n-The Rake does a very little amount of damage to the player. This made my experience wear thin very quickly. I was no longer scared of The Rake before too long.\n-The Rake has an absurdly large health pool. I had first aid kids and enough shotgun shells to blow up the moon. I don't think it would have been enough to kill The Rake over the course of 3 nights.\n-Boar AI seems rather .... dim. I would trap a boar, scare him away, and he'd follow the same path into my tent and right back into the trap every time.\n-In the back of the map, where the Sniper Rifle is located, there's a boat located there in the swamp. It has no collision model and I can walk right through it. This can break immersion very quickly.\n\nThat's all I have for now, but as future updates come out, I may change my opinions. Is this game worth your time? for $5, I'd say so.","November 3, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The potential here is great. Definitely made me jump and there was a decent sense of atmosphere. I'll play it again differently now that I've read the "Help" section, but a couple of things I think could make it better just on first impressions:\n\n1) A hardcore mode or some such, where you can only take two hits at best, and the monster can only take a few as well. This might be just first impressions and maybe the traps do a tonne of damage, but the fear of the monster is lessened a lot by the lack of damage. Another reviewer said they lost half their health from a single hit, but I was only losing about a 10th at most, which sucked the sense of fear away a lot. Same with the monster-- shooting it in the face at point-blank range should do substantial damage to it. Maybe it could regain some health after the night.The mode would also not end after 3 nights, but keep going until one of you is dead. I would really love a mode like that, but it's just a suggestion.\n\n2) You should probably move slower when aiming your gun.\n\n3) Crouching. Even if it didn't do anything, it feels like it should be there.\n\n4 The cameras are a little bit too annoying. Maybe the further away the cameras are placed, the more distorted they should get.","November 19, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also around the 3rd night the scariness begins to fall off and it's replaced with rage on how you can't get a freaking shot on the Rake. Also this isn't really anyone's fault but the english in this is terrible. What I suggest is the developer gets someone who actually speaks english to write for the english version.\nFor $5 on Steam it's not a terrible game to buy.

Day one and two was absolutely awesome. It was horrifying and really well made. Day three however was a huge disappointment. The next part describes why.\n\nIt started fairly predicaple. My cameras went out fast and my pet pig had died. That was all fine and dandy until the actualy rake shows up. Then the situation transforms itself into a "boss battle" with him. To get him out of the forest you need to get out and set up cameras. After that you go to your computer and look at the camera. When the rake runs up to the camera you run out with your rifle and shoot him. Now repeat that 20 to 30 times or so. It gets boring really fast. Sure the first time it is a little horrifying as he can smash your window and use some sort of orb to transport pigs with but that only happens the first time. The rest is just the process over and over. I killed myself with a trap because it was so boring.\n\nThat is my biggest problem with the game. Day one and two is well worth it's price. Day three not so much.","September 13, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The rake itself may not be scary after several encounters, and learning his AI patterns is very easy, but when he catches you off guard or you don't know his location, that's when the game shines. I say give it a shot and see what it has to offer in the future, and I think the content is worth the price, but in its current state, I wouldn't say it's worth more than $10, but still offers a good enough experience to be worth it.","October 3, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I played 2 nights because the day and night cycle actually lasts a long time if you are productive during the daylight hours. Unfortunately, the first day/ night was more of a tutorial since the game doesent have one built in. A feature I rather enjoyed was the fact that Ctrl and Alt are actually  aim and fire buttons as well which is cool if you're left handed. I am not, I just thought it was nice of Devs to put in. Day 2 I got the chance to explore and that was nice, I used up almost all my alotted time. I saw information and posts on a second weapon and traps. I was unsuccessful in finding either. The Rake is not terribly scary himself. His presence, at first makes you do a double take and he makes this noise that takes you off guard when he charges you but thats about it. The mechanic that makes you turn to face him while he attacks you should be changed, being forced to look at him takes away from the scary aspect. If the Rake is charging you from behind, he should just knock you on your face. In my Lets Play I also mention that I would prefer a shotgun over a rifle. Upon reading some stuff, I have found out that the rifle is supposed to be a shotgun but its Europian so it made sense to the devs. I mentioned that it fires like a Blunderbuss, there is only one bullet that comes out, there is no spray and upon actually inflicting damage towards him, each bullet is a sliver at a time. I do like that fact that through the night and going out first thing in the morning, you will notice the Rake will actually harrass you by breaking your stuff, killing pigs and leaving them beside the trailer and even putting pig heads on stakes. Again this game has a lot of potential and I look forward to doing another Let's Play on it when it has had some work done.\n\nFrom now until the end,\nDeathgripPlays\n","November 4, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me first say that I have been dreaming of a game like this.\n\nIt's not just set on switching between cameras or collecting pieces of paper out in the woods, but it's a game that takes multiple elements from those other common horror titles.\n\n\nThe game starts you off in a parked rv, within the middle of a woodland clearing, giving you the necessary items to start your night's hunting. Yes, hunting is actually a part of this game. No longer do you have to be 100% victim to the elements or creatures that surround you constantly. In fact, you get a firearm as well as other protective items. These other items can be placed conveniently to hurt your enemies as well as to lure them to intended locations.\n\n\nOne of the coolest features of this game is that you can set up a minimum of five cameras around the map. The available placement spots for these cameras are pre-determined, highlighted areas on the sides of specific trees.\nA black & white night filter is the only way you can visually see the environment through these cams. This is not a problem though seeing as how the filter does not seem to make trouble identifying things whether day or night. The availability to turn your cameras left or right in limited space is a neat little thing that Rake also offers.\n\nDespite being made in the Unity engine, most affiliated with poorly made indie games, it is actually fairly decent in functionality and its playing mechanics.\n\nThe scares are great ranging anywhere from seeing these deadly creatures appear through security screens to the dreadful sound of fast running feet followed by immediate attack. I cannot describe how bad my heart attacks were from witnessing these things first hand.\n\nSounds make this game. The night sounds exactly how it would in the actual woods, the security feed buzzes and woops are oddly addictive to listen to, the animal sounds are loud and jolt inducing at times, and the little music that unexpectedly plays is reminiscent; in a good way; to Slender: The Arrival.\n\n\nNow that I've listed all of the things that I love about this game, I will carry on to state the few issues I've had with it.\n\n\nThe monsters that attack you are, more often than not, way too fast to react to. If you were running around in the woods and you hear the quick moving feet of your impending doom, you're most likely not going to know where it's coming from let alone land a shot before you are stuck in a scripted taking damage scene. Please find a way to fix this. Maybe something like a faded bar of light that emanates from whatever side the monster is coming from could help. This along with the attack timing. Just give the player at least a few more seconds to respond. This is all to suggest that you are keeping this hit and run formula. If you plan on replacing the current attack script with a more advanced/realistic trigger event, then that would be even better.\n\nAnother thing on the monsters is the models. I'm pretty sure everyone has noticed that the implied different monsters of  the night have literally the same exact same model but reskinned. At the very least they have different sound effects, but the cloning of the monster designs just takes some of the fun out of the mystery and wonder of what they could've looked like. I hope that intentions are to change the models out for better and uniquely scary representations of what they're supposed to be. Please correct me if I'm wrong on the whole model thing.\n\nAn obvious would be the graphics. Yes I know that graphics don't make a game seeing as how I'm rating this game positively, but it would do this game such an amazing service. This game is already, for a majority, rated very positive. This is a good thing for a game based off of an internet story abused over and over for the use of rushed "COLLECT ME!" games. If you can get a positive following for a game that doesn't even have impressive graphics, then think of what will happen with the same game touched up with detail! This would also improve on the already great atmosphere!\nAlso I would find it hard to imagine you defending the graphics here.\nI would not take you seriously if you complemented the hills/mountains in this game.\n\nI have not found many bugs playing Rake, but I'm sure you can all agree that you've witnessed the "I can hear the cameras turn while I move side to side" bug. It's pretty funny to be honest, but it does not do anything to improve gameplay let alone atmosphere. To find it, all you do is press your inventory key "i" while in the cameras. Then get out of the camera view and move around. You'll hear what I mean. Bet you this would be a quick and easy fix. Another bug I've noticed, which is actually detrimental to your game progress, is a specific event at a house. Despite mentioning all this stuff, I do not want to spoil some of the little neat things. Short and short, the game freezes there. Fix that please.\n\nMultiplayer seems currently broken. I started a multiplayer world by myself, and my inventory was not accessible at all.\nI could see a health bar at the top of my screen, and could not use any items. I thought maybe I'm the monster, so I ran out into the woods only to be killed by that lanky Rake. I know this is all work in progress, but it did not make a good first impression for match making. In fact, I would've given this game a negative review if the only part of this game was online. On a side note, it seems like there are newer models for items in the multiplayer mode.\nWhy are they not in single player instead?!\n\nLast thing to mention here is the menu screen. Don't get me wrong. I actually find the menu screen cool with the whole window blind moving side to side and equipment lying around everywhere thing. What I don't like is the buttons. I don't know why, but pressing the buttons on screen makes me feel like the game is going to crash. I believe it because of how low resolution the text is on screen. Often, I mentally associate badly made games with low res menus. So when I see these blurry white boxes on screen with text in them, they give off the wrong feeling. Funny enough, the loading times actually fuel this minor fear even more. It reminds me of how DayZ loads with it making you wait and then having you be in the world already yet with text still in your face. It just makes the processing feel awkwardly slow. Maybe it is though. All I'm saying is that it would be good to have the button displays clearer and somehow make the loading times feel quick and responsive.

The grammer in the game could also be worked on a bit more because I spotted a few grammer errors in the journal and also interacting with things such as placing cameras on trees when you hit the limit of cameras placed. The ambient sounds are amazing in-game and can sometimes warn you that something might happen if you continue on the path you're following. I also liked the shaky cameras when viewing them because it makes it more horrifying looking at the cameras and watching the rake take it down. Although it felt really ironic because at the end, (SPOILER ALERT) you were actually trying to hunt and kill the rake before the rake killed you.\nI'd have to rate the game an 8/10 because it is one of the most scariest games I've ever played. for an early access game, it's pretty fun exploring the map and discovering new places (keep in mind, the rake can show up during day time). I'm also really hyped for multiplayer because it will allow one player to play as the rake and mess around with the hunters (which can be pretty fun). I do hope that they implement random world generations in the future updates so that players will have a new experience every time they start off fresh.\nOverall, the game is worth $5.49 and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hunting and horror games.","July 21, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's terrifying as ♥♥♥♥. I thought wandering around a forest was supposed to be peaceful, like Minecraft, but oh no. If you thought Slender or The Forest was the scariest time you can have in the woods, you were all wrong. In the day it's fun to hunt deer and pigs, and place some cameras. You say to your self, "This can't be that bad! I have a rifle!" Then night strikes and you're thrown into an endless darkness of terror. The eyes of the Rake and the other animals that inhabit these woods all look the same, so when a deer walks by a camera, you have a startling moment when you don't realize it's just a Bambi's mom. I say Bambi's mom, because, much like the story of Bambi, that deer dies. But instead of a hunter killing it, it's a scary ♥♥♥ claw beast. And finally when you've got used to the deer, and are no longer scared to switch cameras, the rake jumps at the screen and the camera's dead. The next day comes 30 minutes later, and you finally think you're safe. You head down to a strange church-like building on the edge of the map. There's a sniper rifle. Then, from the ceiling, the Rake jumps down on you, slashes your face, and runs off. And that's pretty much the game. Rainy nights, cloudy days, and the Rake. Unfortunately, multiplayer (as of this review) has not been added yet, but when it is, I can't wait to kill off my friends by locking them outside.","July 21, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are lovely, it's realistic. And I screamed. Here is what happened...\nSpoilers, if you don't want to know what happens, don't read this.\nMorning 1 - I take in my surroundings, explore the place and put in some cameras.\nNight 1 - Not much happens, I check my cameras throughout the night, not daring to go out.\nMorning 2 - I see a corpse of a pig near the cage, thinking it was my pig. I check the cameras, finding out it was a different one.\nNight 2 - I see a new corpse of a pig nearer my trailer. Still not my pig.. Still no sign of the creature\nMorning 3 - I walk out my trailer, to find pig heads impaled on spears all across my camp. I feel terrified now, and I check my cameras, my pig is still alive. But one of my cameras are out, so I place a new one.\nNight 3 - (It goes DOWN) I check my cameras (still too much of a wuss to go outside) still there are pig heads, but when I turn to my trailer, I see a gruesome sight, human and pig limbs are stuck all over my trailer. I become extremely worried. Then.. my cameras begin going out one by one, and then my pig is killed. I only have 2 cameras left, one far off and one right outside my trailer, I pray that it'll go for the one far off. I look through the one outside my trailer (Cam 1) And I see it... running past into the bushes, I scream. Then, the worst thing happens... Camera 1 goes out.. and im stuck with one last camera... the one far away. I can't bring myself to push E and come out of the cameras, but I finally do it. I look around my trailer then the unspeakable happens, he breaks right through my window, I scream the loudest I've ever screamed in years. But when I find im not dead, I feel better, I then see he only takes a small amount of health off me. I stay in my trailer, still too much of a wuss to go out. Then I see him outside the broken window, I shoot at him, screaming. He runs off, never to be seen again... Then I lose.\nI recommend this game, it was an amazing and terrifying experience.","July 25, 2015","true","6.0"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Single player made me almost **** myself and playing it with a friend was both creepy and hilarious.\n\nAt the time of this veriew Steam says I've only played two hours of the game, but that's because the multiplayer module launches seperately and doesnt let you use steam in-game (so no steam controller/big picture usability, unfortunately).  I've played probably a combined total of 10 hours with my friend at the time of this review.\n\nOne main issue I had is that the Rake is way too hard to shoot.  I haven't tried killing it in Single player, but in Multiplayer it took forever.  My friend and I did actually kill it in multiplayer and had some good laughs doing it, so it wasn't all that bad.  I think the bear traps should actually trap it instead of just damaging it as it runs over the trap.\n\nI also wish the Rake was, I dunno, more dynamic.  The way it attacks feels so repetative that you never really get a chance to shoot it properly, and with that happening over and over again it made me think "will this ever end?"\n\nAlso, when we killed the Rake, I wanted to go over and examine my trophy.  But only mere seconds after the screen displayed "AJ WIN!!!", my friend and I were booted out of multiplayer.  How disappointing!  I wanted to take a close up look at the thing I tried so hard to hunt.  Oh well.\n\nDespite its flaws, overall it's an enjoyable experience, I'd say worth the $6 I paid for copies for my friend and I on the Winter sale.  I'd reccommend it if you have any interest in cryptids/games about cryptids.","January 1","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's absolutely horrifying in singleplayer because you have to simply sit in an RV at night and listen for these fast approaching footsteps in the woods before this creature, the Rake, comes out of the woods and tries to kill you before running off once again.\n\nMultiplayer isn't so bad though. Well, that actually depends on how you look at it. It's pretty spooky but running around with your friends shooting at the little naked white man is hilarious.\n\nThe game also isn't going for cheap horror. It is some hardcore psychological warfare at night in singleplayer but also has very basic jumpscares that aren't really jumpscares.\n\nIt's a good game.","January 10","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'v always been a huge fan of supernatural things and cryptids so I knew I had to try this. And boy, I don't regret that one bit. The camera system is really well made, the creature can be terrifying and the nights make your heart race. This game has A LOT of potential, (not that it isn't good already) but as this gets updated more and more I believe this game will eventually shine.\n\nWhen I started playing, I wasn't too impressed by the enviorment and the sounds, but when nighttime came, all that changed. I became so immersed and and frightened that I wasn't able to leave the truck at all. And when I finally did, the Rake is god damn terrifying. It's so dark at nights, and the Rake is so fast and unpredictable that those 2 things combined make the nights all out horror at least for me.\n\nAll and all this game is definitely worth the 4€. Would recommend for anyone who likes good horror.","July 22, 2015","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And it's terrifying as ♥♥♥♥. I thought wandering around a forest was supposed to be peaceful, like Minecraft, but oh no. If you thought Slender or The Forest was the scariest time you can have in the woods, you were all wrong. In the day it's fun to hunt deer and pigs, and place some cameras. You say to your self, "This can't be that bad! I have a rifle!" Then night strikes and you're thrown into an endless darkness of terror. The eyes of the Rake and the other animals that inhabit these woods all look the same, so when a deer walks by a camera, you have a startling moment when you don't realize it's just a Bambi's mom. I say Bambi's mom, because, much like the story of Bambi, that deer dies. But instead of a hunter killing it, it's a scary ♥♥♥ claw beast. And finally when you've got used to the deer, and are no longer scared to switch cameras, the rake jumps at the screen and the camera's dead. The next day comes 30 minutes later, and you finally think you're safe. You head down to a strange church-like building on the edge of the map. There's a sniper rifle. Then, from the ceiling, the Rake jumps down on you, slashes your face, and runs off. And that's pretty much the game. Rainy nights, cloudy days, and the Rake. Unfortunately, multiplayer (as of this review) has not been added yet, but when it is, I can't wait to kill off my friends by locking them outside.","July 21, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The monster works fast. Fast enough that a few moments later my pig-mounted camera shuts off as well. This time I switch over just in time to watch it lunge. By now I have a pretty good idea of where The Rake is roaming tonight, so I grab my gun and prepare to hunt the beast down...\n\nTL;DR at bottom\n\nThere are many out there who feel that the "found footage" genre of film popularized by Paranormal Activity and Marble Hornets is played out and tired. I do not count myself as one of those people. One thing that, to me, is pretty incredible about Rake is that I kind of feel like the guy holding the camera in a found footage film.\n\nLet me start out by saying you're not randomly trapped somewhere collecting pages for reasons unknown. This is a horror game where you have set out to find the creature in question, and you didn't come empty handed. The bread and butter of the game is the ability to set up cameras which you can watch from your base camp. They rotate at your command, and can be put in a number of different places, and even attached to the back of a live pig. The restriction on the system is that you can only place five cameras at a time, and they aren't invincible. The Rake will go out of his way to destroy hundreds if not thousands of dollars worth of your equipment. ♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nYou also have a gun. This is a monster that can be killed if you're smart and fast enough. It's not easy, but it's possible.\n\nThere's a pattern that I quickly fell into as I played. During the day I set up cameras and traps galore, and when night falls  I monitor the cameras and wait for the beasty to show himself. As soon as he does, I take my trusty shotgun and begin the hunt for the creature. Oftentimes, it feels more like the creature is hunting me. I haven't reached an end state yet, but the gameplay is unique enough where I want to keep trying to best my supernatural foe.\n\nA walking simulator this game is not, which is a relief since most creepypasta based games function in that way. Story takes a back seat here, which is fine since it allows you to make your own stories.\n\nThere are some drawbacks I feel inclined to mention. The camera system feels like a missed opportunity. It's not terrible, but you're limited to a select number of trees and angles. I would love to see in the future an update that allows me to mount a camera just about anywhere, as it would make the gameplay far more dynamic. The graphics of the monster are mediocre up close, as it kind of looks like you're being attacked by an even smaller and skinnier Gollum. When it's fully dark and he's sprinting through the brush towards you he's pretty scary, but in the off-chance you encounter him during the day you're likely to shake your head a bit.\n\nCurrently there's only one map with static elements. Either a couple more maps or a procedural generation element to it would be extremely welcome. The game is rather inexpensive, and you get what you paid for, but it's just exciting to think what this game has the potential to be.\n\nI'd like to note that I'm rather impressed with Rake's AI for both the monster and the wildlife. I've been scared ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at night by a boar more than once, and The Rake is pretty good about making sure you only catch fleeting glimpses of him. He's animated pretty well too, which helps sell the experience more.\n\nTL;DR: I've been so tired of the corridor walking simulators that pass as horror games these days. This is the first game in a while I've played that throws wrinkles in the formula, and that in its own right is commendable. For 5 dollars, you'll get a pretty fun game that might warrant more than one playthrough, if only for the memorable mechanics! If you're a horror fan, buy it!","July 15, 2015","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It really is. It combines a lot of aspects of the surivavl horror genre together. Elements from FNAF and Slender are used to creat something that is truly terrifying.... the first time you play it.\n\nTrue... the Rake scared the crap out of me the first time I tried to play through. I almost ♥♥♥♥ when it came running up on me out of the bushes. But as time drew on, I really became less and less phased with the generic and drab jumpscares. You can't really predict where it's gonna be, but eventually you'll find yourself wading through bushes just to shoot at it. Not to mention the camera system is pretty much useless for the most part. Only 2 cameras on the entire map are actually useful, and they're in the most obvious locations (right next to the camper), the others are there for the lol's. The pig camera, if you can't guess, is the most useless of the lot. Last but not least, the Rake is like taking the fear factor of someone like Mike Tyson, and giving him the punching force of Miley Cyrus. He doesn't do enough damage to be even remotely scary.\n\nHow could the devs remedy this?\n-More damage from the Rake.\n-More diverse/interactive nights.\n-More/freeplace camera locations.\n-Differnt selections of maps.\n-Multiple Rakes.\n-Different creatures.\n\nAll in all, it's not a BAD game.

It's absolutely horrifying in singleplayer because you have to simply sit in an RV at night and listen for these fast approaching footsteps in the woods before this creature, the Rake, comes out of the woods and tries to kill you before running off once again.\n\nMultiplayer isn't so bad though. Well, that actually depends on how you look at it. It's pretty spooky but running around with your friends shooting at the little naked white man is hilarious.\n\nThe game also isn't going for cheap horror. It is some hardcore psychological warfare at night in singleplayer but also has very basic jumpscares that aren't really jumpscares.\n\nIt's a good game.","January 10","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, if you can ignore the obvious problems, you'll find a pretty interesting game underneath. It can be genuinely tense and atmospheric at times. On the first night of the game, I was anxiously watching the cameras I had set up to get a sight of the Rake. I switched to my fifth camera, and saw him standing right in front of it! He took a couple swipes and destroyed it, so I left the safety of the trailer to go investigate. I had my map up, when I notice out of the corner of my eye a dead pig lying on the ground. I equipped my rifle and started looking around. I hear a quick pitter-patter of footsteps, and turn around. We make eye-contact, and he knocks me over and runs off. The hunt was on.\n\nIf you have a few bucks to spare, I'd suggest giving it a try!","January 5","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Single player made me almost **** myself and playing it with a friend was both creepy and hilarious.\n\nAt the time of this veriew Steam says I've only played two hours of the game, but that's because the multiplayer module launches seperately and doesnt let you use steam in-game (so no steam controller/big picture usability, unfortunately).  I've played probably a combined total of 10 hours with my friend at the time of this review.\n\nOne main issue I had is that the Rake is way too hard to shoot.  I haven't tried killing it in Single player, but in Multiplayer it took forever.  My friend and I did actually kill it in multiplayer and had some good laughs doing it, so it wasn't all that bad.  I think the bear traps should actually trap it instead of just damaging it as it runs over the trap.\n\nI also wish the Rake was, I dunno, more dynamic.  The way it attacks feels so repetative that you never really get a chance to shoot it properly, and with that happening over and over again it made me think "will this ever end?"\n\nAlso, when we killed the Rake, I wanted to go over and examine my trophy.  But only mere seconds after the screen displayed "AJ WIN!!!", my friend and I were booted out of multiplayer.  How disappointing!  I wanted to take a close up look at the thing I tried so hard to hunt.  Oh well.\n\nDespite its flaws, overall it's an enjoyable experience, I'd say worth the $6 I paid for copies for my friend and I on the Winter sale.  I'd reccommend it if you have any interest in cryptids/games about cryptids.","January 1","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And NOTHING. HAPPENED! The only way to get the Rake to move is to walk out INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FOREST! He doesn't do anything any other way from what I saw! :/ If you like to wait go ahead and buy this game, but if you are impatient do NOT get this.","December 16, 2015","true","1.4"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

It scares the hell out of you. The scripted events are nice, with the pig heads and limbs, people on pikes, jumpscares, etc. However, the engine is pretty bad so the game is laggy a little and never goes up to 60 fps. I'd rate this 8/10. Concept is phenominal but game is not very good, will do with some work though.\n\n\nEdit: Not to mention the developers really suck at grammar and spelling.","May 14","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
