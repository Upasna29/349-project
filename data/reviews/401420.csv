Skill barely comes into play. This is like match-3 pachinko.","November 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/virotti/recommended/401420/","virotti","virotti","http://steamcommunity.com/id/virotti/","2081 products in account","I've got this game in an old Indie Royale bundle. I'm not used to playing match 3 games. I can say, having played 9 levels, that I find this game good enough for the asking price. It's not great by any means, but it's fun enough if you want something cheap and casual.\n\nPros:\n\n- Some creative levels\n- Easy to pick up and play\n- cheap\n\nCons:\n\n- Repetitive\n- Having to play the same level more than once (not sure why, the game blocks the next level when I finish the current one)\n- 4:3 screen size, no option to change resolution\n- sound design is very basic and a bity annoying\n- Sometimes drawing a line fails, and it's not the player's fault (room for improvement)\n\nAll things considered, I'd give this game a 6/10 (mediocre). Grab it on a bundle or in a sale, and it's likely you're not going to regret it.","April 17","true","2.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Very good physics, which is important for that kind of games, many levels to play, simple gameplay.

It looks like complete trash. It's interface is ugly as hell. In windowed mode it loses focus sometimes because mouse pointer is not locked... Also the FPS are kinda small on my AMD FX4300 / Radeon R9 380 in windowed mode.\n\nBut hey, it IS fun! It's a match 3 / draw a line / pinball game. I've just spent 15 minutes of my lifetime on it and I gonna definitely play this again later.\n\nI got mine for free on one of those "Sell your soul and get a random steam game, you crazy addict" deals so not complaining. The game is funny and playable (even tho it looks like lowquality crap). Would be an awesome, super-duper game if it came out 15 years ago. And has been free.\n\nAnyway definitely recommend. IS a good timekiller.","March 5","true","0.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Why, I don't know, but I DID buy it...\nI bought a fart.\nI don't remember how I got this game, but at some point I had to purchase it. Probably on a sale when it was like 14 cents or something like that. I can say that I got about 14 cents of enjoyment out of it.\n\nPicture this if you will:\n\nI played the first level. It worked fine and I found it enjoyable. At first startup the game crashed really hard and I had to close and reopen it. I then found the clicking to be an enjoyable exercise even though the graphics sucked.\n\nLevel 2:\n\nDidn't work. Playing a match 3 game, where you're supposed to match 3, and click on them to make them disappear. Didn't work. Had a collection of as many as 20 little colored balls that I was clicking on, and those things didn't disappear. That's when I noticed that there was a circling mechanic. Great! Now I know how to play the level!\n\nAnd that fat jerk mechanic still didn't work.\n\nI got one level. one level of crap. I wouldn't say this game took a big dump on the world of casual gaming, but it definitely farted on it. I paid for a fart game. A stupid, stupid, farty game.","March 5","false","0.1"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
