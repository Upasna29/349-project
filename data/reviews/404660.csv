Giant turds are invading the planet and spewing out strange monsters left, right and center. Run, jump and shoot your way past them in this straight forward platformer.\n\nPlaying Vicky Saves the Big Dumb World is like playing a no-holds-barred, angry at heart cartoon. Kind of like a more mature version of the excretory product flinging hero of yore Boogerman. Gameplay is simple but fairly tricky at times, providing a good level of challenge that's neither frustratingly hard or overly easy. Long jumps may take a minute or two to adjust to. I felt it necessary to press and hold the jump button ever-so-slightly before the edge of platforms. Objects will remain destroyed after you resume from a checkpoint, which hindered my progress at one point in the 2nd stage such that I had to restart the level. Thankfully, it was a painless one-minute affair to remedy. Each boss encounter is progressively trickier to beat than the last, they get pretty intense!\n\nPresentation/animations are well-done and each stage is significantly different to the other, both in terms of art and enemies. Backgrounds sometimes have multiple overlapping layers that results in a nice visual effect as you pass them by. The music fits the tone of the game and sound effects are suitably bizarre. Getting back to the enemies, I'm not exactly sure what some of them were, but they could be described as creepy and/or funny, depending on your point of view. Butts, the stuff that comes out of butts, sphincters and ..... other indescribable-to-me creatures roam each level. They seem to get weirder with each stage!\n\nPower-ups are rewarded to you after beating each stage and each one adds a new angle to the gameplay which you will be required to make use of. Simple, fun and varied gameplay will keep you occupied throughout. At this price point, I really can't find any reason not to recommend a purchase.\n\nGiveaway here (ending approx. Nov 17th 2015): https://www.bobmanbob.com\n\nShort video playthrough of 1st stage and preview of the 2nd below:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOa0eMsUQFY\n","November 7, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You play as little girl and you try to save world from monsters? Sound great! Game play is awesome. Monsters don't look to scary, but still atmosphere is here. Of course it's not amazing, but if you like indie games and have some spare time, try it.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYQq5703jDY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0cMgMdggxY","October 1, 2015","true","0.1"," 2 of 42 people (5%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","5","2","42","3","0"
