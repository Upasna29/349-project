The story is great - and this is what this game is all about.\n\nIt is a game which takes itself seriously. If you haven't notived by the visuals already, this is not your usual Monkey Island type of adventure. Compared to comic books, this could be entitled graphic novel.\n\nThe voice actors are very well chosen, as they deliver the atmosphere very well. Looking at the graphics, they are for sure not high-res SSAO 2xAA 3D whatnot. But that doesn't matter, the 2D pixels are perfect for this game.\n\nThe puzzles are most of the time very well thought through, but I must admit that I've taken a peek into the walkthrough sometimes, as I got impatient following the story as I couldn't figure out the solution fast enough.\n\nI havent noticed any bug, so kudos to QA as well.","November 25, 2013","true","8.5"," 77 of 84 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","77","84","0","0"

Gemini Rue is mostly narrative driven, and in order to avoid spoilers I am just saying that it was nice sci-fi short-story material and managed to keep my attention til the end.\n\nIt has to be noted that the noir-ish atmosphere the game creates in places is quite excellent, it is almost relaxing in a way - was quite nice to come home from work and do some off-world detective work.\n\nOn the downside: puzzles and controls have a slight tendency to be annoying. I enjoyed the limited amount of locations, I quickly felt "at home" - but this also ment plenty of backtracking through "known" locations all the time because there are some unfortunate moments when new items / people spawn once certain conditions are met. The game tries its best in providing hints and feedback through the characters to give you a sense of direction, but it could have been smoother in places. Same goes for the actual interface, the right-click combined actions/inventory felt outdated and clunky especially in one or two spots where certain functions weren't explained very well (at all?) . Still, this is nothing a quick glance at a walkthrough cannot solve and shouldn't stop you from checking out this fun little sci-fi story.\n\nAt the end of the day, this is proper Wadjet Eye quality and a worthy addition to your collection. If you enjoyed their other, earlier releases, you will enjoy Gemini Rue.","October 8, 2015","true","9.7"," 39 of 40 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","39","40","0","4"

Shelly Smith-Shenoy who plays one of the female roles does an excellent job of playing an innocent and insightful individual.\n\n- Deep concept. The game plays with fire by toying with the idea of something as profound as identity. It opens up a lot of possibilities right from the moment of the opening scene.\n\n- Interesting puzzle presentation. Some of the puzzles in this game put an emphasis on a macro-level understanding of the environment. You are tasked with solving puzzles which then require you to go through more layers in order to complete the objective.\n\nThis is a great example of a game with a strong premise.

It has an old film noir, Sci-Fi Blade Runner feel to it with gorgeous artwork that feels retro and fresh at the same time. The premise and feel reminds me of a story straight out of Cowboy Bebop, with twists that anyone paying attention to should enjoy. Voice acting and music (very moody and dark ambiance), was also spot on.\n\nI really found the puzzles engaging as well. A lot of point and click adventure games I have trouble getting into simply because their "gameplay" is either much too easy or just too vague in telling me what I am exactly supposed to be doing. I didn't think Gemini Rue had this problem. There were puzzles that were easy solve, and others I had to think about for long minutes before coming up with an answer. The Easter Eggs and achievements spread throughout the game was also a plus for me.\n\nThe only problem I had with the game was the fact that it felt too short, and that after all is said and done, the characters are technically confined to two basic areas throughout the whole game when I wished there had been more to explore... But honestly the game did take me quite a bit of time to beat, and as for the lack of a wider world, I just enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end.\n","November 6, 2014","true","25.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

It stood strong and compelling from beginning to end, and unravelled nicely throughout--right up to a great end.  The graphic scenery really sets the moods throughout, from ghetto and dirty, and dreadful and oppressive, to sterility and tranquility, and to openness and lonliness.  Every aspect of this game blends very well with each other.  The developer commentary scattered throughout adds a nice, revealing and funny touch.\n\nI highly recommend Gemini Rue to all gamers who enjoy an adventure game with a solid story, that knows how to tell that solid story, and contains audio actors that breathe life into the characters that create the solid story.

While a small game, it is very well-made with a good story and voice acting.  Gameplay is a bit clumsy as adventure games often are, requiring actions to be performed through an inventory menu rather than having separate keys for separate actions.\n\nThe best part about the game is the well-balanced puzzle design.  One of the big pitfalls I've found with adventure games is making the puzzles too difficult to understand while others make the game so simple that there's hardly any player interaction required.  This one manages to find a good balance though there are still a couple parts that get confusing.  It is one of the best examples I've found outside Amanita games though.\n\nThe really big disappointment for me was the ending.  I don't want to spoil anything but the ending just didn't make sense to me.  I like how the story ended up, but the way it was done just didn't seem right.\n\nIn any case, it's a high quality adventure game that doesn't succumb to common adventure game pitfalls.

For example, there is one particular puzzle where you need to call a guy using your communicator and try to get some information out of him. If you don’t choose the specifically correct dialogue options when speaking to him, he hangs up. This is quite believable and is probably what an actual human would do. Of course, this game being what it is, you can just call him again and again and again and try a different set of dialogue options each time, and every single time he responds as though you’re speaking to him for the first time. It doesn’t matter how many times you call him – even on the fifth call, he responds as though you’ve not just spoke to him four times previously using ever so slightly different variations on your script. If this were an actual person speaking to another human being, calling the person again and trying the same script with tiny variations would get you laughed at and hung up on immediately.\n\nThe above kind of puzzle is narratively inappropriate because it is just not how a human being would behave at all. The playing experience stops being a nicely flowing story of which you, the gamer, are an integral part, and becomes an arbitrary clicking exercise, jarring you out of the narrative. The above puzzle is also guilty of another puzzle design sin: it seems to exist solely to pad out the game. It isn’t hard, don’t require much thought, and just involves trying different combinations over and over again, wasting a lot of time in the process. I wish I could say this was the only example of this, but it sadly isn’t.\n\nMany of the puzzles in Gemini Rue aren’t game ruining, and they aren’t completely nonsensical (unlike other infamous examples from this genre: the rubber ducky puzzle in The Longest Journey, anyone?) but they are generally quite wonky and boring. At one point you have to find a Carbon Ray Stabilizer to fix your lockpicks (why a Carbon Ray Stabilizer, I have no idea). Rather than buying it from a vendor or asking someone where to find one, you have to search around an abandoned building with some crates hidden towards the back. It’s not even easy to get to the crates – you have to get someone to help you. You have to see the crates when exploring, think “hang on, they must be really important” not “they’re just some old crates at the back of an abandoned room” and then go out of your way to work out how to get to them. Lo and behold, there’s one in the crates. Why is it there? I have no idea. I was just aimlessly exploring because I had no idea what to do next and just so happened to stumble on the solution. That’s not a satisfying solution to the problem, and it makes absolutely no narrative sense.\n\nThe strange thing is that I often feel like I’m crazy for feeling this way; support for old-school point and click games seems overwhelming, and any critical opinions seem to be drowned in a sea of nostalgic rage. I seriously want to love games like this, I really do, but their puzzles make them a gargantuanly frustrating experience. If you’re willing to have a walkthrough in one hand at all times and you’re willing to suspend your disbelief through some poorly designed puzzles, then I would probably recommend this. Unfortunately, I felt frustrated more than I felt enjoyment, which is not something I want to experience in a game.","March 5, 2015","false","8.0"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

You won't find any illogical obstacles and puzzles, pixel hunting or absurd item combining.\n\nWhat you get is a great sci-fi noiresque story, where you are a detective looking for his lost brother on some god-forgotten planet. Later the game opens up and lets you switch between the two main characters, the detective and the missing brother. It really does feel like you're detective, getting dirty and doing the groundwork: asking around, getting true identity of people, searching information about them in database. Top this with action sequences where you can cover and shoot at your enemies and you really get an exceptional adventure game. Voice acting and writing is astounding and the story itself is intriguing and suprising. All of that in a indie game made by the handful of people! I did enjoy the visual style of the game and I think it befits the game, but I guess some people could argue that the resolution is too low.\n\nOverall, superb game, highly recommended. A great reminder that the adventure games are a great way to tell a story and don't have to be obscure and plagued with bizzare puzzles.","May 13, 2014","true","8.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

It's got old school pixel graphics and just great voice acting all-around. The puzzle elements are also a lot of fun. The story behind Gemini Rue may seem derivative. It's set in a universe like the TV show Firefly and it's movie counterpart Serenity, it has the tone and feel of Blade Runner and has the plot of Total Recall. But it never made it bad. It's just taking the good stuff on what I like about science fiction.\n\nYou play as Azriel Odin, an ex-assassin that is looking for his brother on the planet of Barrucus, which is part of a Gemini Star System, a system that won it's independence after a war and is now run by a crime syndicate known as the Boryokudun. The other character you will get to play is Delta-Six whom is a patient of a mysterious facility. This is all I can say about the story without going into spoilers.\n\nThroughout the game, you talk to characters, solve puzzles, do detective-like work to learn about things and occasionally go on shoot-outs. There's an interesting shooting mechanic in the game that you will learn how to use.\n\nAll of the characters in Gemini Rue are well written and feel real. The philosophical themes of identity and memories are also explored in this game and is pretty much what the game wants to explore and talk about. There are a couple downsides of this game. Some of the puzzles are little too difficult and the fictional universe that is offered in Gemini Rue remains mostly unexplored with the exception of a single city on one planet and a facility somewhere else.\n\nBut I recommend this game to Science fiction, cyberpunk and story adventure fans. It's definitely a must-buy!","December 28, 2014","true","19.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

I did not have any difficulty here, once you learn the timing of the enemy it is a breeze. Finding my way to the next plot point was challenging at first, some areas are linear but most need attention paying to investigation and a bit of trial and error.

The story has interesting themes and is portrayed in an interesting fashion. The voice acting fit the characters well and they were all unique. I also liked how the music was very understated and complimented the scenes nicely. It was definitely satisfying to play through to the end and see how the story unfolded, leaving a very satisfying conclusion.\n\nThe graphics are beautifully drawn and make the world feel immersive. Some backgrounds are only seen for a few seconds yet are still richly detailed and almost breathtaking to look at, so I commend the developer for that.\n\nThe puzzles hit the right balance between challenging and logical, there weren't any weird and crazy parts of the game's internal logic. Some areas of the game can be a little tricky and annoying to figure out which part of the map to go to next as you backtrack through familiar areas a few times but nothing too egregious.\n\nThere is combat through gunplay. Instead of just pressing the use button on gun and clicking on an enemy in a traditional point n click style, there is combat where the player takes cover, aims, and has to time their shots in the minigame. While it isn't very complex, it breaks up the puzzles and provide an interesting way of doing action in a style of game like this. I noticed a couple of glitches such as when a sprite in the background would be placed on the top layer in front of my character in the foreground, but this only happened twice.\n\nDefinitely recommended for people who enjoy interesting sci-fi cyberpunk stories with good voice acting and story, especially considering that the majority was drawn, written and programmed by just one student, so props to him for making such an engaging and interesting game. Worth checking out, especially for the really neat easter eggs.","November 25, 2015","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

Seems uninteresting? At first it's boring. I admit it. But then, as soon the game's cryptic nature slowly unveils: a symphony is played. The plot is the real thing here, for IT IS THE GAME. Everything lean on it. This detective story is not an ordinary one, it's more a tale than a noire. There will be a plot twist, but it's a twist that is not trivial at all. It is a fight between light and dark, good versus bad in a corrupt and decayed galaxy (cyberpunk-theme). Cons are the puzzles, they are too easy and gunfights are a little clanky, nevertheless these are just two little faults on an overall masterpiece.\n\nLet's get down to brass tacks:\n\nGenre: point-and-click/sci-fi/cyberpunk adventure/noire\n\nAI: irrelevant.\n\nDifficulty: easy (there are no real challenges, it's more a tale than an actual game).\n\nPlot: great plot. Playing this game is like reading a solid sci-fi book.\n\nAtmosphere: dark and decayed. This game is great mainly because it uses "ancient" graphics ('90s) through which is difficult to convey emotions. The dev team achieved this and for this they have to be commended. GREAT JOB!\n\nGraphics: voluntarily outdated. It's more a game with substance than appearance. It has a lot to talk about so graphics is not a core value.\n\nAudio: voluntarily old. This serves just as the "thing" that glue-up together atmosphere, plot and ultimately fun: without voices and/or sounds the game would be boring in my opinion.\n\nFUN FACTOR: investigating an ever-raining-mining planet under the guise of a cop while at the same time another person tries to survive within a space station. Well, it is adventurous is it not? Thus we can say it is...FUN!\nConclusion: a game that focuses on both atmosphere and plot. "Substance is what it counts" it seems to say. Are you interested in exploring a dark city and try to beat the odds? Did you like Ridley Scott's Blade Runner? If yes then: get it!\n\nThanks for reading.","May 15","true","9.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I am a huge sucker for cyberpunk detective stories such as Blade Runner or Snatcher so of course I loved this one.\nThe art design is most likely a result of a budget, rather than an artistic choice but at least it looks like its actually a game released in the past unlike so many other "retro style indie" games with artists just being lazy. But there were a few times where the graphics were unable to convey an image, so I got stuck in a couple parts where a few pixels were supposed to be an object I could interact with. These were the only parts where I couldn't figure out what to do and it felt unfair in the wrong way. The rest of the game was pretty well designed though. I gotta say, it doesn't feel like an indie game to me, it feels like it was an actual regular game just released in 1991.\nThe voice-acting is surprisingly good and the music and sound desgin was top notch as well.\nI actually wanted to know what was going to happen, so I consider that a good story. Point and Click games often have well written plots (for video games) and lots of dialogue, this one is no different.\nI heavily recommend this game to fans of sci-fi or detective noir stories.","January 20, 2014","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

For good because it stylistically fits right beside games like Rise of the Dragon, Dreamweb and Beneath a Steel Sky. It’s nice to see the style be kept alive.\n\nUnfortunately the game also plays like a 90s adventure game. The controls and interactions are clunky, with none of the streamlining you’d see in newer games. Something as simple as getting up on a box and climbing a ladder involves 4 clicks and 2 keyboard commands, sometimes even more.\n\nThe story almost pulls off what it’s trying to do. In terms of mood there’s nothing wrong with it. The music, sound and visuals work together well. The problem lies with the dialog, which especially towards the end don’t deliver as strongly as it needed to. It’s so close, just another few editing passes might have done it. It doesn’t ruin it, it just stumbles across the finish line. I thought the conceit of the story was done ok. It’s not the best take on the concept, as I thought Dollhouse for example did it much better. But I thought it was alright for what it is.\n\nThe game isn’t a must play. It's good, but not as brilliant as it could have been. But if you feel like playing something that's 90s style, this will deliver, pixel hunting and all.","May 15, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The breath meter is exactly like the golf swing meter, just click in optimal green zone. easy to use, shallow functionality.\nHonestly not a real focus around combat anyways, the story is always trying to make you think about how to approach the current problem or what to do next. and it keeps me playing. often when trying to use an item on an object it won't like or your not supposed to use resulted in me laughing quite a bit at what the dialog of my character.\nThere were and still is times I'm in the game stumped about what to do next, once I was so sure i knew what to do I thought the game was glitched so I checked the guide, I was missing a small step that was very hard to find or think about doing.

So I strongly recommend referencing a guide for the game, that way you can skip over the tedious game play and enjoy the top knotch story.","January 16, 2014","true","5.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Let’s just put it like this, i had the Android version and i never finished it. I liked it that much i bought it here too! It’s like one of the great Lucasarts point and click games reborn.\n\nThe graphics are not your AAA company like Maxis..........(oh wait......that company died xD), Ubisoft...yeah maybe not as this is 1 game in a year not 14 games...ok let’s just say it’s not from a failed mega company. This is a hand-drawn pixel graphicated game. It’s a point and click adventure with a unique gameplay and style. Its Story has this cyberpunk adventure feel to it with its dark sci-fi feel and the most depressing atmosphere. The story is really its core purpose and holy what a story, i was just gobsmacked for such an amazing game; the gripping characters, the helpless feeling and high tech sci-fi cyberpunk future (23rd century) it’s like adding chocolate custard to a scrummy chocolate cake. It’s got images of the characters that speak, great voice acting, amazing soundtrack, interesting puzzles, secrets & collectibles and is a rather challenging game.\n\n10/10 for one of the best experiences in gaming history, and for the amount of love the game dev put into this!

Fans of old Sierra and Lucasarts games will feel right at home.\n\nThe atmosphere can be summed up in one word: oppressive. Rarely have I felt so unwelcome - which is good! The music and sound design are top-notch. However, the voice acting sometimes seems to be a bit flat. The pixelated (but by no means ugly) graphics definitely are a throwback to the "golden age" of adventure games. Don't let them discourage you, the visuals aren't everything. The combat is clunky, but generally not a huge bother.\n\nIt's the puzzles that make an adventure game. In Gemini Rue they're very intuitive and neither too easy nor too hard. Some of them can even be solved in multiple ways, which I felt was a nice touch and shows how much thought was put into making this game. A developer commentary is included, giving further insight into the authors' minds. There are some visual bugs, but nothing gamebreaking.\n\nOverall a very enjoyable game, even if you're not a fan of the genre.

It's an indie sci-fi adventure title that's made the rounds as "the one to beat" in terms of independent adventure games.  Fortunately it falls in the "pretty good" range, while still suffering from a couple problems.\n\nThe voice acting is okay to passable, and serves it's purpose without being offensive.  The graphics are pixelated, and are a lot of fun for nerdy aging weirdo idiots (like myself) who cut their teeth playing old adventure games.  The story itself is very good, with a couple of neat twists and turns.  Finally we come to the gameplay, which is really the lowest point of the game.

It's an indie sci-fi adventure title that's made the rounds as "the one to beat" in terms of independent adventure games.  Fortunately it falls in the "pretty good" range, while still suffering from a couple problems.\n\nThe voice acting is okay to passable, and serves it's purpose without being offensive.  The graphics are pixelated, and are a lot of fun for nerdy aging weirdo idiots (like myself) who cut their teeth playing old adventure games.  The story itself is very good, with a couple of neat twists and turns.  Finally we come to the gameplay, which is really the lowest point of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/recommended/80310/","YoreIore","Azathoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YoreIore/","300 products in account","An adventure game set in a bleak dystopian future that is dominated by the criminal organisation known as the Boryokudan.  You play as Azriel Odin, an ex-assassin turned cop who is searching for a defector from the Gemini System, as well as Delta-Six, an inmate who has had his memory wiped by "The Director".  Fate brings these characters together in this highly enjoyable intense point and click title.\n\nLike other games from developer Wadjet Eye Games, Gemini Rue is a retro-graphic adventure game created using the Adventure Game Studio engine.  There is enough innovation here to make this game fresh, while still retaining a nostalgic 90's feel.  I was constantly reminded of the Blade Runner game and Beneath A Steel Sky when playing this and the developer managed to create a fantastic atmosphere as well as a relatively challenging gameplay experience.\n\nI find that most modern adventure games sacrifice challenging puzzles for an interesting story (see the Blackwell Series).  However, Gemini Rue did stump me a few times and also provided an excellent story that wouldn't feel out of place on the big screen or in some form of graphic novel series.  The story had me hooked and being able to change playable character's on the fly was a great design choice.\n\nInnovation comes in the form of shootouts, the use of terminals for information and choosing when to switch your character.  This last aspect was very welcome when I found myself stuck at certain points, I would just switch character and see what I could do to progress their story.\n\nThe graphics are not "cutting edge", nor are they supposed to be.  The game looks and feels exactly as intended.  You are here for the story and the challenge that comes with a point and click adventure game.  I highly recommend this game to fans of the genre and if studios like Wadjet Eye Games keep producing titles like this, then the genre is at its healthiest since the glory days of the 90's.","April 29, 2015","true","6.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite it's phylosophical approach it's in the end a short game (it took 8 hours to finish it) so some of the interesting topics of the plot (of wich i won't talk to let the gamers discover it by themselves) could have been inquired better, some characters more developed, otherwise i could give it a better rating.

After that crime sindycate named Boryokudan takes control much of the system. At the start of the game you take control of Azriel Odin, ex-assassin now turned to cop. He's searching information on planet Barracus about his missing brother Daniel. Through most of the game you will play with Azriel, but at some point you will take control of Daniel. I don't want to spoil the plot since this is the best thing in the game, but i'll say it includes conspiracy, memory wipe, superb twist, in other words – briliant story. Of course the good writing helps a lot. The ending is quite philosophical.\n\nGameplay wise is pretty standard for the genre, with one exception. I'll talk about it later. You click on a hotspot and choose which part of the body (eye, hand, leg or mouth) or item will be used. After being stuck on 1 or 2 places i quickly realized that the leg icon is quite usefull for moving forward the story. Most of the adventure games i played don't have similar thing. Maybe the most important feature in adventure game are the puzzles. For me they were ideally tough, but veteran players probably will breeze through them. Maybe just 2 or 3 times i was stuck for a brief moment. Puzzels always have common sense and they are tight quite nice with plot. And because of this they are obvious, just listen the conversations. Puzzels include speaking with someone, start a machine, search for information in terminals and some have not the most elegant solutuons – shootng lock, breaking window and so on. The only thing missing is combining stuff in your inventory. Like i said the puzzels maybe easy for those who is looking for a mental challenge, so keep that in mind.\n\nThe exception i meant was gunfights, Yes, it's a bit strange to have such a thing in adventure game, but they fit so well in the story and you won't mind them. They are total 5 or 6, so don't, it' not a side scroller shooter. The gunfights proceed like this: you stand behind cover, then you press A or D to show yourself from the left or right position of the cover and shoot. The enemy is doing the same thing. But you can one-hit kill the bad guys. There is a bar on upper left corner and by pressing a button you will concentrate and when it reaches the green zone it will guarantee headshot and quickly ending the shooting. And you can choose their the difficulty at any point. The game is autosaving before life-threatening situations.\n\nThe graphics. Some parts are great, others – questionable. The game is a nod to old school adventure games and I like pixel art, space cutscene are good, character design and movement are good, but the backgrounds are bland. The levels are okay. You are on the rainy streets or inside a building. Just little more details in the environment won't hurt.\n\nThe sound design is great. The voices for the main characters are great, but i can't say the same thing about some of the secondary. Most of the game doesn't have any music, but when it does, it's great. It's starts and stops abruptly and this is unfortunate.\n\nThe biggest problems here comes from the technical side of things. The game runs at max resolution 1280x800 and it's locked at 40 frames per second. Sometimes Esc doesn't work. When this happen press Space bar and then Esc again. For me this is fixing the problem, i think. When you load save game half of the screen is black, until you move away from that scene, but this happen only 3 times through my whole playthrough.\n\nGemini Rue is fantastic adventure. Right from the start the game intrigued me and i was glued to the screen, until i saw the end credits. It offers fantastic story, gritty sci-fi atmosphere, gunfights, light puzzels, but it suffers from some unfortunate technical problems. One more thing. Almost the whole game is made by a single person. This is quite impressive. I highly recommend it.","March 17, 2015","true","9.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Well- with this game, you're there!\nA sci-fi romp following a split story between a prisoner who lost his memory, and a detective- you point and click your way through this beast.\n\nSeemingly taking ideas from point'n'click adventures before it (Beneath a Steel Sky, Blade Runner, I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream), this one manages to meld the lot and create its own beast.\n\nStory is solid, with some twists in the tale, "trust noone".  Puzzles are plentiful, but sometimes a pain as items appear when a puzzle is solved on a completely different screen- or a dialogue box that you happened to have missed.  There are no "real" muliple endings, what you get is a linear story, but if you do something at the end you can get an extra line of dialogue.\n\nGraphics are very welcome.  Instead of looking "old", the lo-resolution pixel art gives the game character, screamingly familiar to a mid-90's adventure.  Effects, such as rain manage to give the world a sense of life, even though the setting is so dark.\nThe zoomed in pictures in dialogue were OK at best.  Compared to the games smaller pixel art, it felt to me that these had far less character- most of the time not fitting to the ingame graphic and voice.  Without these, I felt the game would have created more of a link to the player with their character if it were just the pixel guys opening mouths and bobbing their heads.  I hope they include an option to turn off the dialogue graphics in their next game.\n\nGameplay was mostly point and click, with a gun fight mini-game.  Point and click was standard,  right click and you can (eye), (hand), (foot) etc.  The game is fairly short at roughly 9 hours, and a few more if you want to find the achievements.\n\nThere is a problem that you can't pull up your inventory to look at items (there is no inventory button).  In order to look at an item you need to right click on an ingame object, then right click on your item (makes little sense).\n\nBugs:  There were some graphic bugs, but nothing game breaking.  I found that sometimes the right have of the screen was garbled after a load.  Also, if you have an instance of Chrome in the background, dialogues could not be shown / heard.  It was all skipped.  One screen also had a graphics "layering" problem, where the background was infront of the forground (groundfloor of the apt building).\n\nOverall;  Gemini Rue is a great point'n'click adventure that should've been released in the 90's... But it's out now!  There are a couple of bugs, but they don't break the game.  The amount of character and soul put into this project is worthy of a lookup, this is a game I'm proud to say I've completed.","January 30, 2014","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I was expecting your standard point and click adventrure game, but this one has really set the bar high on impressive storytelling and unexpected twists.\n\nThis is a gem for anyone who loves adventure game and deep stories. In this you start play as a detective who looks for a man who can find him where his brother is, but he never turns up for your meeting and so you go looking for him. This friend also knows the location of your character's brother, who he's trying to find.\n\nYou also get to play as one of the prisoners in a rehabilitation centre omnimously named, Centre 7. You play as a man named Delta-Six who has his memory erased for the second time because he had attempted to escape. As him you attempt to break out yet again.\n\nAgain, I highly recommend it to everyone.","August 10, 2012","true","8.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

With an unforgettable story and quirky puzzles, the few gameplay sections that may try to detract from the experience couldn’t manage to deter me from playing through this gem. I’d easily recommend this game to fans of old adventure games.”\n\n8/10 TJBs","January 28, 2015","true","5.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3danyon/recommended/80310/","3danyon","Tuss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3danyon/","375 products in account","It's a point-and-click adventure game of the older variety (puzzling puzzles and all), which, for some reason, puts some people off from the very outset. Assuming you're not from that group, however, you will find a game with a pretty unique and intriguing story, accompanied by a very fitting noir atmosphere (I hesitate to call it cyberpunk, though similar themes are employed) and well executed retro graphics. On the other hand, the story and the atmosphere are the good parts of the game.\n\nWhy do I say that? Well, even when it works the controls, particularly those for shooting, are a bit of an annoyance. The game would've been better without those action sequences, but alas, they're there and can be endured. The main complaint, however, is that the game is rather buggy in game-breaking ways. There are workarounds, but it still makes it a bad product. For example, on Windows 7 x64, the first thing one has to do is to turn the Steam overlay off, or else any alt-tabbing or shift-tabbing means that all dialogue will be in fast-forward mode, making it impossible to follow the plot. Resonance, another game from the same developer, has the same issue, so at least I kind of knew about it.\n\nNext, after a restart my saves just disappeared. Turns out this can be fixed by moving them from \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gemini Rue\reslists\Saves\nto \SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Gemini Rue\Saves but why should I have to? Oh, and the escape key needed to access the menu sometimes stops working, at which point one should apparently realize that hitting shift first helps. Oh well, at least I didn't have to patch the game with specific versions of DLL files, but that reportedly happens too.\n\nNow, if you are willing to subject yourself to all of that, there's a nice, really well-voiced sci-fi story in it for you.  If not, you're probably just being sensible. Either way, I can't really recommend paying full price for the game. Sales level prices, yes, but perhaps only to fans of the genre.","January 10, 2015","false","7.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxSan/recommended/80310/","FoxSan","Fox San","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FoxSan/","368 products in account","Gemini Rue is a pretty standard point-and-click adventure with a fantastic plot. It appears to be a straight and to-the-point point-and-click adventure game telling a story in a no-nonsense dystopian future involving a detective searching for his brother imprisoned within a testing facility. But when you learn that the facility is for rehabilitating criminals by wiping their memories and starting them with a fresh slate, it begins to make you question what makes us who we really are.\n\nDespite being fairly low-res, the game does look good. However, it does not cooperate well with multi-monitors, the Steam overlay, and alt-tabbing. Also, the save system stores saves in two separate locations depending on how you launch the game. The actual point-and-clicking is fairly standard, but there are a few points in the game involving some really sub-par combat that the game could have gone without. These broken systems all make the game's presentation feel a lot cheaper and incredibly fragile to run. I'd rate this game higher if it wasn't for these issues, but they were so prevalent that it bugged me every time I played. If you can overlook functional bugs, definitely see your way through this game for a fantastic finale.\n\n3 out of 5 foxes.","December 4, 2013","true","23.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is clear that the dev draws inspiration from these two titles since he even mentions it in the included developer's commentary mode, and includes cameo appearences of the main Cowboy Bebop characters.  I very much enjoyed the puzzles, which are not overly complicated, but gradually become more challenging by cleverly combining the basic actions that are available to your character.

The puzzles are decent, the production values are all there, and the premise certainly sounds fascinating, doesn't it? How could I possibly dissuade you from purchasing and experiencing this promising sci-fi title?\n\nThing is, the story just fails to follow through. The "twin" plotlines resolve in the most obvious way possible (a development that is telegraphed HARD by the appearance/voice of a certain character), and possibly the most intriguing aspect of the story -- being an amnesiac in a prison of amnesiacs -- is similarly resolved in the least interesting way possible. I was very hyped to see what kind of intrigue this game would bring to the table; turns out it brings exactly zero. I hate to be the guy who says something is bad because it's predictable, but it really was that disappointing.\n\nI would be more lenient, because as I said it's well put together; art and atmosphere are solid, voice work and soundtrack are on point, etc. But there are similar games in the same genre and/or offered by the very same developer that are so much more satisfying in their storytelling (Technobabylon, for instance). Overall it is the most disappointing Wadjet Eye game I've bought, and that's coming from someone who's liked pretty much everything else they've put out.\n\nP.S.

It has all the hallmarks of classic games within the genre and is of a quality that puts some big-budget modern games to shame today.\n\nYou assume the role of two characters in this intertwining story;- Azriel Odin; a former assassin who is searching for his brother whilst looking for personal redemption for his past; and a mysterious hospital patient named 'Delta Six' who's memory has been wiped for reasons unknown. Your job is to collectively discover the secrets that exist in this bleak, corrupt and crime-riddled world and provide a resolution to your characters's plight. As the narrative develops and the story unfolds; you will be hooked. For such a simple 2D game; the story is truly absorbing along with the fully-voiced characters each with an intriguing personality.\n\nThe user interface is also extremely well implemented which is pivotal as this game demands complete precision in the execution of tasks and puzzles. It is incredibly complex at times and you will be forgiven for having to look up the occasional solution but it is a testament to the developers on how to create a challenging, thought-provoking and engrossing game.\n\nIf you're a veteran of the genre, a fan of adventure games or just looking for a story-driven title that offers a rewarding challenge; Gemini Rue is absolutely unmissable. It captures the essence of classic games perfectly and delivers a powerful and intriguing experience throughout.

I was surprised and amused when my silly guess was right. The most important thing for me in games is the story, and unfortunately I didn't like the story in this game. The entertainment value in the gameplay is also very important and in this game I had to struggle through the bad gameplay. The pixel animation is minimal (I spilled my drink laughing when I saw that an unconscious character was put on the table, not on the sofa, because I guess the devs didn't feel like to draw a lying character in the proper position for the sofa) and the pixel art is often smeared and out of focus. I would not recommend this Point & Click adventure game, because it's very boring and predictable. http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604113003 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=620720190 Unlocked all achievements!","February 10","false","8.1"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","12","28","0","3"

The graphics are horribly pixilated, just as games from that era were with audio and voice acting to make up for the lack of graphical attractiveness.  And it does make up for it in those areas, the characters have parts that are well written and well performed with a very human story to go alongside it.\n\nThe story is one I can appreciate.  The story follows two brothers, one trying to escape a station after having his memory wiped several times and the other trying to find the station and rescue his brother.  I liked it, the reveal happened a lot earlier than the real reveal and the major reveal becomes a lot more predictable the longer you go on through the game.  However, the writing is self-aware of its own predictability and manages use it as part of the build up -to the expected result- without insulting your intellect.  Instead of happening with an unexpected bang, it happens with a silent drone of acceptance, which I thought was what the author was trying to get and fits in with the environment they were building.\n\nMost adventure games tell stories of odd worlds and go out of the way to say how different this world is from the one we live in.  This game tries hard to explain the world with experience and view we can relate to, emphasizing the people without dwelling on the sci fi, dystopia, or technology.  From that standpoint, the game is a lot more serious than most of the games filling the adventure genre.\n\nThe UI and puzzles hold the experience back somewhat.  The puzzles follow the standard point and click or dialogue variety with some machine operation and event type obstacles alongside it.  The gunplay they added to the game was clunky and annoying to do.  It's easy once you manage to figure it out but it feels like something to pad the length of the game.  Some of the puzzles also have this feel, as if they were made just to lengthen the game by making you repeat content and without adding to immersion.  The UI also soured me.  It is not terrible, but some of the user unfriendly conventions of early adventure games were adopted alongside the art style.  I did have some problems trying to figure out how to use items in my inventory together, something infrequent in this game and I wish I gave more thought to the tooltip telling me how to do it the one time I had to during the game.\n\nIn all, I'd say it has the bones of a good adventure game and is at least as good as the games it emulates.  Unfortunately, the UI, gunplay, and some of the puzzles leave the experience feeling clunky.  A good find for adventure game fans, less so for everyone else.","February 14","false","6.2"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

The writer apparently hasn't got an original thought in his head, but is very impressed with himself for having passed Philosophy 101. For a game that makes a big deal about free will, it's kind of ironic that there are literally no choices to be made, no story branches, nothing that you can do that will affect the plot in the slightest. At least most of the visuals are nice.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly pretty straightforward once you acquire the necessary items and information, but there's a lot of plodding around just picking up random crap wondering where it will come in handy. There are maps of a city that you're in for much of the game, but you can't even explore most of what it shows- you're a cop chasing leads, and literally everyone lives in TWO apartment buildings.\n\nThe game is also plagued by some serious bugs, which for some users could prevent them from running it at all, or cause crashes that prevent further progress. It took me quite a bit of research just to get it running, and then a lot of trial and error to get past one such bug, but I did manage to make it to the end. Not particularly glad I did.

The stories are often juvenile, puzzle solutions defy logic and the games themselves don’t have much adventure. The best I can do is say that Gemini Rue isn’t terrible but too many people here are going way overboard on their praise of this game.\n\nThe main reason to play adventure games (I think) is for the story. GR’s is a cut above most of what you’ll find in the adventure genre but it’s still not what I’d call “good”. It’s simply okay. Nothing particularly memorable, though there are at least a few twists thrown in.\n\nLikewise, I loathe navigating through the UIs in these games because they often turn simple tasks into complex ones because of poor design. GR has several moments like this, too, where you’ll know what has to be done but have to figure out the exact way the game prefers you do it.\n\nI will give it some points for puzzles at least having rational solutions instead of falling into the trap of “adventure game logic”. When you have to reach a ledge, for example, you’ll pull over a crate to stand on instead of throwing a rubber chicken at a cat who will get a dog to chase it who will knock over a vase which will startle a mule into kicking you up to the ledge. Again, though, it’s so annoying to have to point and click around to figure out the exact right combination of menu instructions to get up on the crate & climb up to the ledge. I’d much rather have a jump or climb button and be playing a different game.\n\nThe gunfight minigame is a nice diversion from all the pointing and clicking but is inferior to any action game. It was a fun challenge, at least, to get the Steam achievement for not getting hit once during them.\n\nThe graphics are retro, which means they are not so great and are around mid-1990s standards. Considering this, they at least do a good job of conveying the “dirty future” atmosphere the game is going for and set an appropriate mood.\n\nSo if you like adventure games, I’d say you will enjoy GR. If you aren’t crazy about the genre, though, you won’t find anything here to change your mind.","January 22, 2014","false","8.8"," 8 of 27 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","8","27","0","0"

Soundtrack is awesome - game is fully voiced and the environmental sounds are realistic (voices sound different when heard through closed doors, for example)\n+ characters. The main protagonist feels like a comic version of Bruce Willis in the 80s (Last Boy Scout!), except he's living in 2229.\n+ introduction of characters. Meaning you might not immediately notice who will be very important in the future.\n+ dialogues. A bit of fun, a bit of violence, a bit of philosophy. An intriguing cocktail of feelings that makes you wanna keep playing.\n+ plot twists. nuff said here.\n+ easter egg characters. I didn't find them all - there's an achievement for that (the only cool one, see below)\n+ open world feel. Of course the game is very linear, but at certain points you get the feeling you could go everywhere - you just don't want to.\n\n-  graphics. They're just a tiny bit too pixely for a game of this millennium. At certain points there are overlapping errors.\n- playability. Had to google how to combine objects in the inventory. Also frantically scrolling around trying to see the cursor change and show anything you can interact with feels good once acomplished, but can be tedious when you're stuck.\n- achievements. Only for the hardcore because most of em are a joke: STAIR MASTER - use stairs instead of the elevator, srsly? It does not affect anything. Also, not getting hit in fights (see below) or finding ammo in an adventure game is just... meh...\n- gunfights and boxes (I mean crates, not boxing). They're like repetitive, useless mini-games no-one needs; not difficult, either. Feels good to kill a meanie with a headshot though (yes, the game does give that option).\n\nOverall, the pro's are outweighing the con's since they're very big and important pro's and tiny, non-essential con's.\n\nI highly recommend to any fan of point & click, to any fan of darker stories. Although not being replayable really I'll might give it another run (with dev commentary).\n\n","December 23, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The big draw here is the noir science-fiction story.  A point/click adventure without a decent story is useless, and Gemini Rue is interesting if you are into futuristic urban dystopia.  There is a good bit of suspense, but also a lot of do-this-so-you-can-do-that linearity that will frustrate you if you get stuck, because there's nothing else you can do until you figure it out.  The best part of the game in my opinion was the part where you could switch between two characters, so if you did get stuck, at least you could switch to the other character's storyline until you were ready to go back and tackle the other point in which you were stuck.  Eventually it all comes together nicely with a satisfactory ending and some fun easter eggs along the way.  The voice acting and sound/music effects actually add to the suspense and game atmosphere, so that's a big plus.\n\nI am not a big fan of the pixelated art style, or my cursor getting momentarily stuck every time it ran into an edge of the screen (hit escape until the menu centers, and then hit it again - you should have your cursor back).  If you aren't into point/click, but the theme interests you, you should give Gemini Rue a go.

The look and animation of the game remind me of old games I used to play on the Amiga, in a good way.  The sound design is well done as is the voice acting, though it would have been nice to have some variety in the lines that get repeated often.  The puzzles in the game are generally relatively simple, but this is for the best as it keeps them from causing too much interruption in the story which is the highlight of the game.  In the game you play the part of several characters, and at one point can even change between them to complete portions of their story in whatever order you choose.  That is one of design strengths of the game, like pretty much any game in the genre, the progression is basically linear, however there are different paths which must be explored completely to allow you ultimately progress through the story, but you can complete these paths separately or work on one them move back to another then come back to complete the first.  This both allows the game to move more naturally as you don't feel like you are on rails most of the time; and allows you to do something else and come back to it if you get stumped in your progression.  I'm not the best point and click player and often have to refer to walkthroughs to complete them.  I did have to do this two times, and in both cases it was very small objects in the environment which I didn't realize were interactive that stumped me. I liked the low res look of the game, but the pixilation probably aggravated these objects not standing out.  If there were a system to highlight the objects that were interactive, that would help to eliminate that issue.  Yes, that would be easy mode, but if I could only turn easy mode on when I really needed, it would interrupt much less than having to leave and do a Google search.  The only other minor gripe I have is that you cannot view your item inventory without first finding an interactive object.  If you like point and clicks it's a must play, if you don't then you'll find it less aggravating than most.","February 26, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While the dialogue is simple, it’s enough to grasp the story and make you think.

Soundtrack is awesome - game is fully voiced and the environmental sounds are realistic (voices sound different when heard through closed doors, for example)\n+ characters. The main protagonist feels like a comic version of Bruce Willis in the 80s (Last Boy Scout!), except he's living in 2229.\n+ introduction of characters. Meaning you might not immediately notice who will be very important in the future.\n+ dialogues. A bit of fun, a bit of violence, a bit of philosophy. An intriguing cocktail of feelings that makes you wanna keep playing.\n+ plot twists. nuff said here.\n+ easter egg characters. I didn't find them all - there's an achievement for that (the only cool one, see below)\n+ open world feel. Of course the game is very linear, but at certain points you get the feeling you could go everywhere - you just don't want to.\n\n-  graphics. They're just a tiny bit too pixely for a game of this millennium. At certain points there are overlapping errors.\n- playability. Had to google how to combine objects in the inventory. Also frantically scrolling around trying to see the cursor change and show anything you can interact with feels good once acomplished, but can be tedious when you're stuck.\n- achievements. Only for the hardcore because most of em are a joke: STAIR MASTER - use stairs instead of the elevator, srsly? It does not affect anything. Also, not getting hit in fights (see below) or finding ammo in an adventure game is just... meh...\n- gunfights and boxes (I mean crates, not boxing). They're like repetitive, useless mini-games no-one needs; not difficult, either. Feels good to kill a meanie with a headshot though (yes, the game does give that option).\n\nOverall, the pro's are outweighing the con's since they're very big and important pro's and tiny, non-essential con's.\n\nI highly recommend to any fan of point & click, to any fan of darker stories. Although not being replayable really I'll might give it another run (with dev commentary).\n\n","December 23, 2014","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is also the story of a nameless detainee in a mysterious facility where mind erasure and “re-education” are the rule. These two stories run side by side with players alternating between roles, filling in the narrative blanks until they finally come head to head during the game’s climax.\n\nAs for the writing, while some of Gemini Rue’s twists, motivations, and dialogue seem hackneyed at times, they can easily be written off as contribution to the game’s pulp roots. The gameplay is mostly solid, with a decent shooting mechanic for the “action” sequences and plenty of point-and-click puzzles to solve. My only gripe is that some clickable objects are very small, requiring one to play “hunt the pixel” in order to interact. More than once this caused me to overlook an otherwise obvious solution.\n\nIn the end, Gemini Rue turned out to be a pleasant experience and worth the investment. If you’re a fan of sci-fi noir, classic point-and-click adventure games, or both, you should consider checking it out.","December 23, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The action is pretty basic, but provides a necessary aspect of danger to the game.\n\nIf you appreciate artsy, atmospheric games. If you appreciate noir and adventure. And If you can bear a few puzzles in between I'd strongly recommend this title. The puzzles themselves aren't usually major headscratchers either, but enough to contribute to making you feeling like a badass noir detective.

It's a genre that lends itself too well to existential angst and superficial anti-corporatism. The themes of human identity in the face of transhumanism and the threat of all subsuming, monolithic corporation feel overplayed to me. They've lost their appeal to me through sheer overuse.\n\nNonetheless, I can't help but appreciate the aesthetic and style of the genre. There is an inescapable appeal in hard boiled sour old badasses walking the worn wet streets of slums and ghettos orders of magnitude more technologically complex than contemporary society, feebly clinging to their humanity in the face of dilemma after dilemma. For me, Blade Runner captured this atmosphere and mood, and for that it is one of my favorite films. Gemini Rue has also nailed this feeling and ambience, and because of that I keep coming back to it years after my first playthrough.

I grew up with point-and-click adventure games and this one was clearly different, if only because the object you use to move foreward don't seem contrived or out-there at all.  No rubberband-and-carrot boomerangs to kick-start a bunny generator so it can release bunnies to form a fluffy bridge to cross.  Nope.  Need to stop a guy from shooting you?  Right click on him, left click on gun, dead.  Need to open window? Right click on it, left click on foot, etc.\n\nIt only took me about 3 days of on-and-off play to finish this with just a bit of difficulty.  This game is very good at giving you all the tools you need to succeed, you just have to be paying attention.  Nothing the game makes you do seems trivial.\n\nThe story was very well written and I couldn't find any holes in it.  No one breaks character and they're all very unique.\n\nLearning not to use WASD and instead click the screen to move around was a little strange, and sometimes I had trouble moving the characters where I wanted them to go, but it didn't bother me that much.\n\nBONUS: If you're someone who likes references or easter eggs, there are a TON of Battlestar Galactica references in this game.

The puzzles are challenging without being artificially obtuse or irrational, but where the game really, really shines is in atmosphere and plot. It inhabits that nebulous grey area between classic science fiction and cyberpunk and really makes it work. The two principal characters are both sympathetic and relatable albeit in different ways and the voice acting, while not amazing is by no means bad.

The narrative was gripping, friendly characters were likable, and supporting characters all seemed like they belonged in the world and evoked the correct emotional response. The dark, rain drenched neo-noir setting is perfect for the story being told. Scenes were beautiful, the music fit superbly, the voice-acting was believable, and the sound effects were realistic. Is a person simply the sum of all experiences and outside input or is there more to a person? Gemini Rue explores identity, ethics, and even free will. Like all great pieces of fiction, which Gemini Rue definitely is, it'll leave you contemplating the questions it poses even if it doesn't offer a concrete answer.

This one gave you the ability to switch between stories, not just characters, and play both sides. Sometimes forcing you into the other storyline as to not reveal certain key plots until ready. I felt the controls were OK aside from sometimes walking my character into a wall when trying to run through a doorway. The context menu was a neat feature although underwhelming at times and pointless at others. Those are all minor things really, and I don't think they'll detract from the story in any way.\n\nFor a game that was developed so recently it had a lot of issues supporting certain video modes and hardware it seemed. I understand the 8-bit style, and it looked great, but why are the video settings so absurd for this game?","July 5, 2014","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a narative driven scifi noir piece that's punctuated by a series of logical puzzles using the enviroment, conversation, your inventory and an ingame wolrd database. The World is heavly inspired by noir scifi such as blade runner, akira or Renaissance, and each screen is oozing with atmostphere. Gemini Rue is a rare game that gets everything just right, every element complements each other perfectly; the graphics, charaterisation, setting, narative, interface, aethetic, sound, puzzles and pacing, all boils down to a game that knows exactly what tone of voice its projecting. If you ever get a day of uninterupted game time, i'd highly recommend this very well executed piece.","December 27, 2011","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Neo-noir style detective story that's definitely influenced heavily by Blade Runner. It's not a very hard game. I only got stuck for any length of time once. It took about 7 hours to finish. Graphics are very retro from around the early-mid 90's. The music was really well done and fit in well with the type of story and there is full voice acting. The main character sounds a lot like McGruff the Crime Dog and he even wears a trench coat  like him too. lolz. There are some lame action sequences involving ducking behind cover and shooting enemies as they pop out behind their cover. Thankfully, there weren't too many of those and they were easy enough. Opening and walking through doors was a bit clunky, but it's not a huge problem. Genre fans will like this game and newcomers might like too if they don't mind the old-school graphics It's on the easier side of p&c adventures and the solutions are logical enough.","November 12, 2011","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The dark, rain drenched neo-noir setting is perfect for the story being told. Scenes were beautiful, the music fit superbly, the voice-acting was believable, and the sound effects were realistic. Is a person simply the sum of all experiences and outside input or is there more to a person? Gemini Rue explores identity, ethics, and even free will. Like all great pieces of fiction, which Gemini Rue definitely is, it'll leave you contemplating the questions it poses even if it doesn't offer a concrete answer.

I grew up with point-and-click adventure games and this one was clearly different, if only because the object you use to move foreward don't seem contrived or out-there at all.  No rubberband-and-carrot boomerangs to kick-start a bunny generator so it can release bunnies to form a fluffy bridge to cross.  Nope.  Need to stop a guy from shooting you?  Right click on him, left click on gun, dead.  Need to open window? Right click on it, left click on foot, etc.\n\nIt only took me about 3 days of on-and-off play to finish this with just a bit of difficulty.  This game is very good at giving you all the tools you need to succeed, you just have to be paying attention.  Nothing the game makes you do seems trivial.\n\nThe story was very well written and I couldn't find any holes in it.  No one breaks character and they're all very unique.\n\nLearning not to use WASD and instead click the screen to move around was a little strange, and sometimes I had trouble moving the characters where I wanted them to go, but it didn't bother me that much.\n\nBONUS: If you're someone who likes references or easter eggs, there are a TON of Battlestar Galactica references in this game. I won't give them all away, but the person who created this was clearly a fan.","June 25, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good story, but ugly. Not a must buy, but I think you should give it a try.\nMost importantly, do not bother watching the trailer. I think it does a poor job at selling the game.\n\n\nThe story, well written dialogue, and voice acting are the greatest aspects of the game. The story is noir style in a dystopian future. Not a masterpiece, but it kept me interested enough to want to play to the end. The story is told from two points of view. In a dark sombre future you play as a detective, piecing together clues to find your brother. In parallel, you play as "Delta-Six", an inmate in a mysterious prison-like facility, slowly uncovering its secrets, unsure who to trust.\n\nThe puzzles are not overly difficult: I never had to resort to a guide for help. One puzzle was particularly frustrating. It required the correct dialogue choices in a conversation. It felt more like trial and error than a logical puzzle.\n\nGraphics look old and blocky. The screenshots shown above are representative of the final product. Not a selling point of the game, but I did not mind.\n\nThere are some gunfights. I did not care for them, but they were well suited to the noir setting.\n\nThe UI is ... unique. Particularly, an odd design choice was to allow you to access your inventory only by right-clicking on an object in the game world. No biggie. Another annoyance is that when a second character follows you around, sometimes they might block an entrance/exit, e.g. a door.\n\nA greater annoyance is the save files of this game. When you start the game, you get a window with 2 options: either "play" the game, or "configure" the game's settings. If you choose "configure", you go to a new window where you find a button called "save and run". So those are the 2 ways to start up the game.  The problem is that, depending on which way you started the game, the location of the save files are different. For more information on this problem, look at the game's steam forums.\n\nI've played some indie games in the past that felt amateurish, as though it were a school project. For example, controls felt bad, or graphical eyesores when a character moves across the screen or when the camera pans across the scene. None of these problems manifested in the game.","February 18, 2014","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The voice acting is mostly great, the dialogue well-written and the story, which, at first, is a somewhat cliched (but still well done) sci-fi noir, touches on some philosophical matters.  And really, it's the core of it all, the story. The puzzles (which are mostly well done, though ocassionaly it involves some pixel-hunting) and the minigames are only there to keep the story going and to let you submerge in it. The soundtrack is sparse but still, very atmospheric (and can't deny that it's been, er, inspired by the Blade Runner soundtrack) and yes, I have to return to the voice acting: it's really good.\n","February 27, 2014","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outtawacc/recommended/80310/","outtawacc","Chipped","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outtawacc/","270 products in account","Extremely well-written point and click game. I personally find this game superior to Telltale's The Walking Dead in terms of storytelling. It has good pacing. Being a point and click certainly helped as there are no filler scenarios. There no sudden surprise wrap-up endings. The story's twist isn't cliche, and not entirely expected or unexpected.\n\nAesthetically, the use of dark colors and constant rain give it a sort of noir detective feel and the retro look kind of aids with the game's overall themes. Being science fiction, you can expect discussion about identity, which the game discusses very well and gives you a lot to think about. It doesn't end in a clean manner and does not shove morals down your throat. The soundtrack is a mix of trcks that sound very sci-fi in nature, and some somber jazz tunes.\n\nMost puzzles were pretty straight-forward, though the combat mechanics feel a little out-of-place and take some getting used to. The gameplay isn't what makes the game attractive though. If you're looking for a game with an excellent story, you should definitely pick up Gemini Rue.","September 11, 2013","true","37.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/outtawacc/recommended/80310/","outtawacc","Chipped","http://steamcommunity.com/id/outtawacc/","270 products in account","Extremely well-written point and click game. I personally find this game superior to Telltale's The Walking Dead in terms of storytelling. It has good pacing. Being a point and click certainly helped as there are no filler scenarios. There no sudden surprise wrap-up endings. The story's twist isn't cliche, and not entirely expected or unexpected.\n\nAesthetically, the use of dark colors and constant rain give it a sort of noir detective feel and the retro look kind of aids with the game's overall themes. Being science fiction, you can expect discussion about identity, which the game discusses very well and gives you a lot to think about. It doesn't end in a clean manner and does not shove morals down your throat. The soundtrack is a mix of trcks that sound very sci-fi in nature, and some somber jazz tunes.\n\nMost puzzles were pretty straight-forward, though the combat mechanics feel a little out-of-place and take some getting used to. The gameplay isn't what makes the game attractive though. If you're looking for a game with an excellent story, you should definitely pick up Gemini Rue.","September 11, 2013","true","37.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is also the story of a nameless detainee in a mysterious facility where mind erasure and “re-education” are the rule. These two stories run side by side with players alternating between roles, filling in the narrative blanks until they finally come head to head during the game’s climax.\n\nAs for the writing, while some of Gemini Rue’s twists, motivations, and dialogue seem hackneyed at times, they can easily be written off as contribution to the game’s pulp roots. The gameplay is mostly solid, with a decent shooting mechanic for the “action” sequences and plenty of point-and-click puzzles to solve. My only gripe is that some clickable objects are very small, requiring one to play “hunt the pixel” in order to interact. More than once this caused me to overlook an otherwise obvious solution.\n\nIn the end, Gemini Rue turned out to be a pleasant experience and worth the investment. If you’re a fan of sci-fi noir, classic point-and-click adventure games, or both, you should consider checking it out.","December 23, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/roguescience/recommended/80310/","roguescience","RedDreadnaught","http://steamcommunity.com/id/roguescience/","89 products in account","Very good, nearly great.  The big draw here is the noir science-fiction story.  A point/click adventure without a decent story is useless, and Gemini Rue is interesting if you are into futuristic urban dystopia.  There is a good bit of suspense, but also a lot of do-this-so-you-can-do-that linearity that will frustrate you if you get stuck, because there's nothing else you can do until you figure it out.  The best part of the game in my opinion was the part where you could switch between two characters, so if you did get stuck, at least you could switch to the other character's storyline until you were ready to go back and tackle the other point in which you were stuck.  Eventually it all comes together nicely with a satisfactory ending and some fun easter eggs along the way.  The voice acting and sound/music effects actually add to the suspense and game atmosphere, so that's a big plus.\n\nI am not a big fan of the pixelated art style, or my cursor getting momentarily stuck every time it ran into an edge of the screen (hit escape until the menu centers, and then hit it again - you should have your cursor back).  If you aren't into point/click, but the theme interests you, you should give Gemini Rue a go.  Don't know if I'd buy again, but recommended for a playthrough as a good change of pace from action games.","December 28, 2014","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What caught my eye in the trailer for it was a very atmospheric and cinematic game. Despite some bugs that may take some googling to get around, the game seems to deliver on those advertised aspects. I'm suprised at how engaging the voice acting can be and the general moodiness it puts you in.\n\nThe gun combat isn't that great, and in some stealth scenarios it's not very intuitive that the enemy could see you from such a distance, but I think the game allows for enough trial-and-error that it doesn't get in the way of the better parts of the experience.\n\nThe writing and atmosphere of the game are great. The graphics are a little dated, but that might be the aesthetic the devs were going for. Higher resolution options would have been a welcome addition. The game's story is interesting and engaging. Some of the game interactions may be a bit buggy or unintuitive for today's audiences, but gamers that are very familiar with the quirks of point-and-click adventure games will feel right at home.","February 8, 2014","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is normally not a genre I'm a big fan of, but I was drawn to this game's sci-fi/noir setting. The voice acting is a little weak in places, but overall the performances are well done and add to the grim, "Blade Runner" feel to the game. The puzzles were never obtuse or lacking logic as sometimes plagues games in this genre, though the few combat sections did feel out of place and tedious.\n\nThe story is probably the high point of the game, and brings up some fun questions about what makes us who we are. Plus, it has a gritty detective searching for a missing person, rain-slick streets, a heavy-handed criminal syndicate, a mysterious facility where the patients are prisoners . . . if that sounds like fun, this is 7-8 hours of your time well spent.","July 6, 2015","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat to me feels rather cumbersome - I usually don't play point and clicks in one go due to the puzzle solving nature of it, so have combat in different parts of the game makes me go 'uhh what was I supposed to do again?'. After playing through the whole game and going through the second time, I revisited the tutorial and realized I've totally forgotten about the aiming bit (pressing control button to trigger an aim) and have been shooting blindly, although I managed to get through with my blind shooting. Dying isn't brutal as the game reloads from an auto-save point upon death (although it's better to have your own saves as well to lessen the steps between the auto-save point and the action).\n\nThis game has a 'hardcore' kinda feel to it, in a sense that it makes you do one step by step. Like if you wanted to open a door, you MUST walk near it and then open the door. However, I do like the fact you can kick things as well as addition to the normal 'see/talk/pick up' mechanic.\n\nThe voice acting is good, and I like the mood the game sets. The little touches in the game like how well animated the rain is, and the sound of the rain gets louder when you open the door to the rain outside is pretty immersive.\n\nDefinately a recommendable game if you like a decent storyline, atmospheric mood, decent voice acting despite dated and not-so-great graphics. If you do play this game, I encourage you to save alot as you can have different solutions to certain things in the game and missable acheivements.","March 14, 2014","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I came back to review it because even though initially i didn't think much of it, it apparently left a deep mark. In my book, something that can make you feel something, long after it's no longer there - is something good. At times i get these flashes... i miss the rain, the streets, the buildings, the tunnels like it was all part of the good old times, to the point i have to remind myself i never went to Barracus.","February 13","true","9.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
