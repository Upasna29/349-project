Most of this time was spent on the timing puzzles. While the puzzle genre is full of mediocre puzzle games, Obulis is one that is worth playing. The physics behind the game are great and some of the puzzles are truly devilish. As with any puzzler, there isn't much re-playability since once you know how to do a puzzle, well, you know how to do that puzzle.","December 1, 2013","true","15.9"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","43","51","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/11330/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This is a long review so if you just want a summary of why I recommend this game skip to Results and read from there.\n\nIonFX makes a fun little puzzle game that produces a special world that combines Newtons three laws with gravity pushing your puzzle solving to the test. With sweet music and pleasant level design Obulis offers a deceivingly peaceful play through.\n\nGameplay:\nAfter nine fearless hours I have completed Obulis. Obulis is an interesting game, but surely isn’t for everyone. In the category of puzzle games Obulis tests you by using a version of physics without friction to propel, roll, jump, shoot, catapult, and bounce spheres into containers. The levels vary and there are about 152 levels. The level difficulties go from Simple to Master with everything in-between. There is no difficulty setting for the campaign so in a single play-through you will play through a various difficulty settings, which pushes you through a rather smooth difficulty curve. Each section of Obulis has an ULTRA level which unlock after completing challenges throughout the “entire” campaign. These levels push you to the test and completing them unlocks achievements.\n\nFeatures:\nOne of my favorite aspects of Obulis is that there is no rating for the puzzles. You either solve a puzzle or fail a puzzle, there is no score. I like this concept, but it essentially means there is no replay value to Obulis as there is nothing to do after you complete the game.  The puzzles keep you on your toes, and the slowly getting more difficult challenges keep pushing you to new levels. As you progress through the chapters of the game the not only are the levels changing, but they introduce new concepts: cannons, catapults, ballista, trebuchet, gears, horizontal moving floors, vertical moving floors, and more. These concepts differentiate the puzzles and make each of the levels seem unique rather than repetitive.\n\nGame Issues:\nI write a lot about this, but if you love puzzles and like precise timing you will probably get past this quiet easily. My major gripe about this game is that the puzzles are really more based on precise timing rather than finding a solution. You may find the solution on your first attempt, but because you have to time each click perfectly you’ll be sitting there for hours. When I was playing Obulis there were actually times where I went online to look at guides to see if I was solving the puzzle correct only to find out I was, but my clicks were not timed exactly perfect. On some puzzles it gets to the point where it stops being a puzzle game and it becomes more like “Sports Arena” the arcade game made by Sammy USA Corporation where there are lights circling the border and to win prizes you must push a button right as the light next to the prize goes on. If you have never heard of this Arcade Machine you may be able to assume that it’s essentially impossible to win because of how difficult it is to time when to push the button. Obulis presents similar annoyances as “Sports Arena”. Essentially you are just sitting there clicking a button at slightly different times to solve a puzzle you figured out the answer too quite some time ago. One of the other annoyances was that Obulis didn’t always give the same result to the same physical interaction. Sometimes the ball would move slightly differently even though the same exact event was occurring. This “glitch” sometimes resulted in me having to restart even when all the clicks were correct. Luckily if you are worrying during gameplay about whether you solved a puzzle correct and are just timing the clicks wrong there is a way to ease the pain. Go on YouTube and all the puzzles have been solved and made into videos, this can allow you to view if you’re making the mistake or not.\n\nResults:\nThe tedious timing issues and the minor glitches in the physics engine didn’t take away from Obulis; Obulis is actually a good play through. It offers about seven hours of puzzle solving (about two of the hours I played was with the game on pause while I was out doing other things). I recommend this game if you can get it in the Indie Puzzle Pack for a discount. I would not recommend paying full price for this game as it is essentially something you’d be able to find free elsewhere.\n\nPros:\n+Over 152 different puzzles\n+Fun simple puzzles with nice serene music\n+Comes in the Indie Puzzle Pack with a few other games\n+Puzzles of varying difficulty, not all puzzles have to be solved to complete the game (some of the hardest puzzles can be skipped)\n+Very easy controls, only requires a mouse\n+Puzzles vary, add new challenges, and increase in variation as you get further in the game.\n\nCons:\n-All the achievements are for completing the Ultra Puzzles\n-The game has some flaws in the physics engine\n-Most of the puzzles have obvious solutions but require tedious work to correctly time to collisions","February 25, 2014","true","9.9"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","29","30","0","0"

Then you're right with this game. It felt to me like a endless bunch of billiard trickshots mixed with well timed cut-the-rope actions. There are ca. 150 levels which need to be solved. Each level is lovely designed with hi-res graphics, view of depth and a nice soundtrack for the different worlds. My favourite is Desert (somekind of mexican style).\nFirst it starts easy: colored balls lay around or hang on chains, which you can cut. Then the balls are rolling, colliding and repelling. The aim is to get all balls in the same colored pots. Once a ball falls into the wrong pot, the level is failed. You have to find your strategy. In higher levels there is also essentially the timing important when you shoot a ball out of a cannon to hit another ball in the air. The game prooves to me that easy made but good software can entertain you a lot.","January 28, 2014","true","9.8"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","5"

In the resulting level-up, I was rewarded with a 90% off coupon for a game called Obulis. Checking the store page, I figured the game looked interesting enough, and because the coupon cut the total price down to a meager €0.50, I saw no pain in buying it, especially with all the other games I bought and have yet to even touch. It's a purchase I do not regret.\n\nIf you like puzzles, there's no reason why you shouldn't pass this game up. Even at its full price, it's fairly reasonable. Perhaps my only big gripes with this game are the occasionally obstructive foregrounds (such as in the Windmill area in Chapter 1) and the over-reliance on perfect timing rather than logic. Far too many times did I have to reset the level because I cut the chain/rope/pole a split-second too early or too late, making the marble in question completely miss its mark. This is especially bad in levels that require a lot of steps to complete. It's frustrating in that you can't solve the level despite knowing the solution.\n\nBut aside from that, everything else about the game is highly addicting and I strongly recommend that you try it if you're a fan of puzzle games. Just keep one thing in mind if you're a completionist: If you can't solve a level, DO NOT LET THE GAME SHOW YOU THE SOLUTION. Otherwise you'll forever forfeit the stars you would have obtained from clearing it.

You have multicolored balls that must reach a given pocket or hole.  In order to do so you'll have to figure out the proper order and timing on when to release them from their dangling/swinging chain, or when you need to move them with the click of a mouse.  I really liked this game, it was very simple to play, but at times very complex to solve.  That's what I want to see out of any puzzle game, the difficulty being in the puzzle itself, not trying to figure out how to get the game to work for you.  Simple graphics, forgettable music, but it all fits perfectly because of the fabulous gameplay and physics that this game offer.

I can see how that might be an necessity so thick-fingered users on a small phone don't tap the wrong chain by accident, but on a tablet this is already unnecessary, and on a PC, where the mouse cursor highlights the chain to be cut, this is unforgivable.\n\nThe second annoyance is that these are not so much physical puzzles as timing puzzles: you can usually figure out the mechanics quickly, but the timing is so unforgiving that it usually takes several tries to implement a solution that you have already figured out.\n\nAdd to this the observation that ball behaviour seems to depend on the color of the balls -- I put a small grey ball in a resting spot and hit it and I can hit it to a place 4 times out of 5, and I put a small colored ball in the same spot and never get it there.\n\nMy impression is that this game simply tries to prevent me from doing what I want to do. Few things are more annoying than that, and I'm certainly not going to annoy myself voluntarily. I'll stay away from this one.","April 1, 2014","false","0.7"," 16 of 23 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","16","23","3","0"

Since it comes with 4-5 games (depending on how you count the two Gumboy games), Obulis costed R$ 0,40-0,50 (US$ 0.18-0.23). It's definitely worth the split price, but paying for the whole pack (even on discount) and having only one nice game to play (this one) that I could've played for free in flash game site... well, it's almost disappointing.

There are all kinds of obsticles/puzzles/containers/apparatuses in each level reminiscent of the well known android app called "cut the rope".  The physics engine is not always consistant ... which you only really notice because some puzzles are designed to utilize the game physics to get the ball in the hole so to speak.  The game is light on options in that you only can mute sound effects/background music, but overall fun and enjoyable.

This makes it very addictive though, since it trigger a nice sense of achievement when you finally succeed some of the trickier levels.\n\nFor me it felt like it was all mainly about relaxing and work on my patience, since some levels demanded a few tries to get the timing right.\n\nI would say that this is a nice game if you are looking for a relaxing way to practise your patience, including a calm brain teaser.

However, I found that once I started playing, it was a lot of fun. This is a fun puzzle game involved marbles. Unlike something like Angry Birds, the physics allow for levels to be played nearly the same way over and over. I love the way the physics work as there is no surface friction and all collisions are perfectly elastic. It's like a physicist's wet dream. For only $5, it is worth it. Some of the levels are really challenge, and you are motivated to complete them.

Whereas Cut the Rope had dozens of different ways to interact with the puzzles, in Obulis all you can do is drop marbles by cutting chains. But you need to cut them in the right order and with a strict sense of timing.\n\nThe physics of Obulis have no friction whatsoever. When looking at a level, you need to gain a sense of where momentum can come from and how to transfer that momentum from moving marbles to stationary ones. Sometimes it's easy to screw up the timing of a marble drop and need to repeatedly restart, which can get frustrating, but it's a skill you get better at if you play for long enough. There are also multiple solutions to most puzzles, so if you find yourself retrying a level for the 75th time, it means you're probably going for one of the harder solutions and you're missing an easier one.\n\nIf you're a puzzle enthusiast or an achievement hunter searching for a reasonably straightforward game to add to your 100% list, I recommend it. Just be warned that, also unlike Cut the Rope, this game is not afraid to pull out some difficult puzzles. There are a good 20 levels, especially near the end of the game, that will really give your mind a workout and make you earn that completion.","February 12, 2014","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You try to get the balls in their containers by hitting off of walls and other balls, rolling on platforms, and swinging off of chains. It's a pretty known concept, but the different environments created for the game definitely make the game a relaxing one. There are about 150 different puzzles to solve, and they range from simple to master difficulty, with 6 difficulties in between.\n\nI read the other reviews written so far, and I gotta say I disagree completely with them; If you repeat a level, and do exactly the same moves every time, you will always yield the same result. By definition, that means there isn't any luck involved. Some levels do take a bit of precise timing, but they tend to have large margins for error, and the levels reset very quickly, so it's not like messing up takes too much time. All you need to solve the puzzles is a bit of patience (only necessary for the hard ones) and a brain (also really only necessary for the hard ones).\n\nIt took me about 6 hours to get through all of the levels and unlock all of the achievements. For a puzzle game with a fairly simple premise, I think that's more than good enough. I was fortunate enough to be gifted a copy of this game, but I feel like  it's worth the $5 normal price, given that for me, that's like $0.80/hr of gameplay. And if you don't think it's worth it, pretty much all steam games go on sale 4 times a year, usually for more than half-off.\n\nIf you like Casual games, if you like puzzle games, if you care about atmosphere as much as gameplay, then I would recommend this game to you.","January 19, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Turcotte\n\nWere do I start? My first impression of the game was " Wow, a cheap rip off of Cut the Rope" but after really giving this game a chance, i relized how good the game really is. The music, soft mellody has a really good effect to the players and most likely makes them continue to play it. The Artwork also has a really good impact.\n\nBut, I don't recommend the Game.

"Difficult" is in quotes here because it's not really the puzzle itself that is difficult, it's the fact that they require millisecond precision in making sure the balls hit the right thing at the exact right second. It's less a puzzle and more a frustrating exercise in trial and error reaction time crap-shoots where you'll be replaying the same level over and over with slight variations on your timing to try to make everything fall into place.\n\nThe controls are horrible.  You have to click on a chain or thing to select it and then right click to cut it.  It would be far more natural to use a swiping motion over a chain or thing to cut it, as is done in a popular game called Cut The Rope.\n\nAlso, you can't adjust the sound effect volume or the music volume.  You can only mute or unmute.\n\nFortunately, this game only cost me 49 cents and I can write it off.  3/10 would not play again.","February 10, 2015","false","0.0"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","3","10","2","0"

I replayed some puzzles 20 or maybe 30 times before success, completing a level give a lot of satisfaction and an really exhilarating feeling.\n\nRecommended","July 21, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I own over 300 titles.  This is like $5 @ FULL PRICE and $1 when on sale.  Absolutely great value at either price.  Over 150 physics puzzles to play & trust me there are easy ones to get ya' started and then you move into VERY FRUSTRATING FUN.  Some puzzles require PERFECT TIMING.  A simple 'path' to victory may require 30 PERFECTLY TIMED 'mouse clicks or instructions' so a single puzzle could take 1000 tries if you JUST CAN'T TIME IT RIGHT.\n\nOverall this is just SO DANG FUN but then again I love puzzles and the physics part of it makes it a blast.","July 21, 2014","true","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's something very calming about this premise, and the graphical design as well as sound direction really bolster this effect. The game opts to create a soft wall of sound out of sound effects appropriate to the setting, rather than plaster the levels with repetitive music. The result is a game that is a pleasure to play, for short bursts or long stretches.\n\nMany of the puzzles do require precise timing, to varying degrees of difficulty, and some of the puzzles are difficult enough to become frustrating. However, when the solution is finally completed, it is often very elegant, and there is a great sense of satisfaction putting the complex little machinery into action, observing it working in perfect synchronicity, and watching the balls fall one by one into their respective pots, with a satisfying 'clink'.\n\nIt doesn't sound like much, but this atmosphere that the game fostered, has drawn me back to finish it three times. It's definitely worth a try.","April 1, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not saying I needed it but if you use it a few times you kind of become dependent on it. I got about 3/4 of the way through this and just started watching Youtube solutions. Another thing is objects are easy to overlook and that can make solving puzzles seem like trial and error once you bump something you thought was a background object. That sucks when a game starts out fun and then kind of makes an ♥♥♥ of itself by becoming unplayable out of nowhere.

Your goal it to put colored balls in jars of the corresponding color. It feels a bit like pool or snooker trick shots, instead of using a cue you merely release balls  by cutting ropes and let gravity set balls in motion, either vertically from single chain or with a pendulum move when the ball was hanged with two chains. just check a video to get a feel of the gameplay.\n\nIt could be as frustrating as any puzzle game, however, with it calm pace and music, I find it relaxing in the end. This is not the kind of game I will play anytime, but when in the proper mood it feels like a soothing infusion. Especially after a tense session of fast paced action games.\n\nUsually there are two phases to the puzzles, fisrt figuring out what to do, and secondly executing your plan properly, depending on the levels either or both are difficult. The game is fairly easy early on and might seems dull or mundame, but as you move across levels the challenge rise up. I replayed some puzzles 20 or maybe 30 times before success, completing a level give a lot of satisfaction and an really exhilarating feeling.\n\nRecommended","July 21, 2014","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The  aim is to get the marbles into the same coloured containers. In order to do so you need to manipulate chains, which drop the marbles, to make sure the marbles bump into each other to allow the coloured marble to get to the right container. There is a bit of physics involved in this game as you need to calculate the correct time to release the marble to win. As you win each level you collect stars (which don't do anything except track your wins)\n\nThere is no story in this game, just a series of puzzles to complete. The game should last you a while since there are more than 150 levels, depending on whether you choose to play them all that is. The music is nice and calm which helps you think in these puzzle games.\n\nTghe main problem I have with the game is that there is no sense of progression in this game.

All an all a quick pretty game with a soothing soundtrack.","May 28, 2015","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To do that you got to basically break the ropes/chains at the right time and in the correct order. Honestly, the game isn't that hard, it just takes a bit of trial and error. But this doesn't mean the game sucks. The game is still great for a puzzle game. It also has new mechanics introduced every now and then which makes the game more interesting and keeps you playing.\n\nLil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P83b_jXI1n4","August 30, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One might argue that it's a physics thing, but I have proven this wrong. In Chapter 2, in the level Pharaoh's Tomb I, you have to cut the wire holding the blue orb, so it'll bounce off of a gray one, roll, and land in a slingshot, and from there, you continue in the level. Problem is, it's COMPLETELY luck based whether or not the ball lands in the slingshot. I've tried it at least 40 times, and it's only landed in there twice. You should never mix luck and puzzles together,","January 16","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
