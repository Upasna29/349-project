"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thenerdstrikesback/recommended/221260/","thenerdstrikesback","RadiantChaos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thenerdstrikesback/","172 products in account","Little Inferno is one strange beast of a game. Upon startup, the game immediately presents nothing but a fireplace, and tasks players with simply burning the few letters they have with them. Immediately afterward, a catalog is sent, and the rest of the game is spent purchasing items and setting them aflame, watching the strange animations each item has. My first reaction, upon realizing what the game had in store for me, was "They made a whole game out of this?"\n\nThe humorous thing about this game, though, is that it WANTS you to feel that way. In fact, it encourages it by making you wait long, painful periods of time - upwards of a couple minutes - for your new kindling to arrive. And yet, for whatever reason, I found myself enjoying the experience. It was strangely appealing, setting things ablaze, and I wanted to see what would come of my neighbor, who continuously sent me letters. So I kept playing for 3 hours straight.\n\nIn the end, the game throws a massive twist on you. I don't want to spoil too much, but let's just say that I was completely thrown for a loop and felt like quite a fool for having spent such a long time playing the game. This isn't a criticism to Little Inferno; rather, this is the highest praise the game could achieve, because it is exactly what the developers sought to accomplish.\n\nA couple of days after playing Little Inferno, I can't help but reflect on it fondly and reminisce. A remarkable work of satire, I truly believe this game will be remembered for all time as one of the most humorously self-aware experiences this medium has ever created. Well done, Tomorrow Corp.","January 1, 2014","true","3.4"," 121 of 128 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","121","128","0","1"

It's an amazing game. When I bought it with the Humble Bundle, I expected it to be this lame indie game about burning stuff. Imagine my surprise when I realized that I beat the game in one session 3 hours later. The visuals are amazing. The cracking sound of burning embers is so relaxing. It was so relaxing just watching the fire and hearing the flames spread.\n\nFurthermore, the story is captivating. I excitedly opened each envelope and laughed and cried along with the characters. The  ending was amazing. I really felt the characters.\n\nMy only complaint is that it gets a bit repetitive towards the end. By then, I caught myself buying random stuff and burning them immediately, haha. However, the combos prevented this, and it was extremely fun trying out different things.\n\nVisuals: 10/10 - Amazing dynamic flames\nSound: 9/10 - Amazing sound of burning embers\nStory: 10/10 - Captivating story\nGameplay: 8/10 - Fun, but a bit repetitive.

The item descriptions are full of snide and sometimes sinister remarks. The general atmosphere of the game is a blend of frenetic happiness with dark undertones, and it conveys that really well.\n\nOtherwise... I mean I get that it's satirising consumer culture, mobile games with micro-transactions, and entertainment addiction... But in the end all you're doing is burning things, collecting coins, and burning more things. You're doing the things you're supposed to be laughing at.\n\nAs for the story being told, it never really resolves into anything that makes much sense; instead it's happy to drop hints here and there and pull at your heartstrings without substance.\n\nWhat little gameplay is there is pretty refined - the burning effects and physics are fun to toy with.\nI think "toy" is more fitting for this than "game."\n\nOverall, I still recommend it because it's so well put together. And really, I want that soundtrack.","October 30, 2014","true","4.1"," 73 of 77 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","73","77","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/recommended/221260/","DrFrogAddMe","Dr. Frog ☭","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrFrogAddMe/","500 products in account","Fireplace simulator 2013 is more than just a sandbox game. The base storyline is in a world full of what seem to be orphans, the planet is getting colder, and to keep warm the “Tomorrow Corporation” (Also the name of the developers) make an entertainment fireplace for all the boys and girls. The story continues as you play more into the game.\n\n\nThe base gameplay is clicking to create fire, and buying this from a catalogue to burn them. Unfortunately, you have to wait real time in order for the toys or electronics or whatever to arrive. This mechanic in the game is a massive downside, because some items in the later catalogues take a full 2 minutes. I see that the Dev’s wanted to make the game last longer but it's an annoying amount of time. Not long enough to alt tab and do something else, but long enough for the player to be annoyed. This time can be finished but using stamps, which can be collected by burning certain combos of objects. The list and what items required are online so this can be figured out easily. The gold coins you use to buy the objects to burn, are earned by, you guessed it, burning things. Its almost impossible to go broke in this game, with profiting from burning most things, and random spiders coming down and providing $ from their burnt corpses.\n\n\nBurning combos, at first, seem to be the only objective. After a little bit of time someone in the next room sends you a letter, befriending you. Her and “The weatherman” start to produce a legitimate storyline, making the game more appealing, drawing the player to play more. After grinding out the combos the player is handed a combo that is very easy to do, implying said player has a good memory. After that combo is completed a whole new world and story is added to the mix. The story is added in gradually but soon becomes the full focus. Its not only a well told story, but it's also a grasping one.\n\n\nThe graphics of the game fit the game alright, but the music in-game make the world around you feel so much darker and lonely, suiting the game perfectly.\n\n\nLittle inferno does some things right.\n\n\nThe sound and music is amazing\n\nThe story is one of the best i have ever seen out of an indie game\n\nThe combos, are witty and require some thinking, making it more immersive\n\nThe fireplace looks good, and get to annoying to look at\n\nThe objects you burn are rather comical\n\nThe ability to toss burning objects around your fireplace is good fun.\n\n\nLittle inferno does some things wrong too.\n\nThe lack of achievements and playing cards make the game a time killer, lowering their audience\n\nThe story although great, is slow to get started.\n\nThe repetitive nature could leave some players bored after an hour or two\n\nThe combos are both hard and easy at the same time, depending on the player’s skill\n\nThe combos are really easy to look up shortening the game time and lowering the fun\n\n\nLittle inferno, although a compelling story and a good time killer, isn't really worth the $10.99(CAD). With the lack of achievements and playing cards, it seems almost like a narrative interactive book, then a game. The price aside, i think people who love a great story, or even just wanting a few hours to go buy, should pick up this game. If it's ever on sale, get it. This is the weatherman, signing off. We’re all going to be okay.","May 7, 2015","true","12.0"," 87 of 106 people (82%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","82","87","106","16","0"

But it is! It is incredible. I have now finished it about 5 times on different platforms. This playthrough I sat through and completed the entire game in one single sitting which took me about 3 and a half hours. Honestly one of my favourite games ever made.\n\nSo what is the premise of little inferno? Well you burn stuff. It's that simple. Burn everything you get given then buy more stuff to burn. So that sounds boring?! The real fun comes from making combos. Burning the right items together gives you a combo. You get a hint for each of these combos and then you have to work it out yourself.\n\nWhat really builds this game though is the story. There a few different characters that build together a story throughout the game. They communicate to you only through 1 way, letters. Except somehow the developers seem to find a way to make you relate to these characters and gets them to convey a very wide range of emotion. The story is unique and really keeps you attached throughout the game.\n\nThe style of the game is incredible. What I mean by this is the graphics and the soundtrack. They both fit together perfectly. The graphics are cartoon like and everything is stylized incredibly well to fit the theme. The soundtrack is a mixture of tracks that are upbeat and slow and always convey the emotion of the scene. The main theme is great and they even have a nice little sing a long video at the start with a catchy but scary song (you'll know what I mean when you see it). It is definitely something I would be willing to listen to outside of the game.\n\nSo theres not really much more I can say about little inferno. The concept of the game is simple and sounds boring and terrible. But somehow it is incredibly fun. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone!\n\nTheIronicGamers rating system Don't ever buy this game.\nMaybe consider it on a sale.\nAn average game.\nA good game that should definitely be considered.\nA must play!","August 10, 2015","true","3.6"," 62 of 69 people (90%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","90","62","69","7","0"

However, the game goes beyond it's surface premise, offering up a critique of its very own genre and a potentially thought provoking story set in an often unsettling and sometimes outright scary world.\n\nAs the world gets colder and colder, The Tomorrow Corporation releases the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace, which you are a brand new owner of. In order to combat the frigid temperatures outside, you'll spend your days throwing everything from credit cards to televisions to robots (and much, much weirder things) into your fireplace. As you burn, unlocking new items from the 7 different catalogs, you'll interact with others through letters where most of the story is told.\n\nWhile there are a large amount of items to unlock, and subsequently turn to ash, as well as “Combo” puzzles to solve, most of the focus of Little Inferno is on the setting and story. A story that, whether by authorial intent or not, is often vague and never very upfront with its intentions. This implicit style of storytelling allows the player to glean however much or little from the game as they want. Is the game really just about burning cool stuff? Or is it using an environmental message as a vessel to tell a deeper metaphorical tale? It's really up to you and how far you want dig into the game.\n\nIf that idea turns you off, and $10 seems too steep a price to satiate your inner pyromaniac, this may not be the game for you. For everyone else, whether for its impressive fire effects, its haunting soundtrack, or its intriguing story, Little Inferno is a game likely to stick with you well after you finish it.","December 25, 2013","true","5.6"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/221260/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","From one of the makers of World of Goo comes Little Inferno, a game about setting toys on fire just to watch them burn. As a new recipient of the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace, along with Tomorrow Corporation’s plethora of catalogs, it’s up to you to stoke the flames. Whether it’s a pile of blocks or a gaming tablet, a fluffy bunny or a toy school bus, the final destination for all of your things is directly into the fireplace. It is there that they will burn, explode, freeze and rain. And when you’re all out of things to burn, with the fire slowly reducing your material possessions to ash, you buy some more toys to fuel the fire.\n\nAlmost the entire game is spent sitting in front of the fireplace. There are no alternate fireplaces. There are no fireplace expansions. There is no clear objective as to what burning all of your toys is meant to accomplish, aside from staying warm and passing the time. The only actions you have available to you are to upgrade the amount of things you can possess at one time, speed up the delivery of the things you order and unlock new catalogs, each featuring a new set of toys to burn. And, of course, the ability to throw these toys into the fireplace and set them on fire.\n\nBut perhaps I’m getting ahead of myself. This is merely a simple game about throwing things into a fireplace. No need to rush ahead of that. Like how Hydrophobia depicted realistic water collision, Little Inferno approaches its subject with much more consideration than you might expect. The fire, as it spreads from toy to toy, feels real. No two items necessarily burn the same. Toss bricks into the fire and they catch slowly, burn slowly. Toss some of the mail you’ve received and they’ll burn up quick, reduced to cinders in mere seconds.\n\nThis doesn’t take into account the various special items you can burn. Everything from mini-nukes to school buses to replica moons, complete with their own gravity fields, are available to you. There’s a fan that will blow out the fire. There’s a fan that will suck in the fire. Toss one on the left side of the fireplace, the other on the right side of the fireplace and you’ve got yourself a funnel of flame, coursing over everything in between. Not happy with how everything turned out? Accidentally froze your fire over? Drop in a mini-nuke and scour it clean with a single blast.\n\nYou won’t have all of these toys available to you at once. In order to access the catalogs you have to do two things. First, you must use all of the toys available to you in the current catalog. It’s a little forced, but I can see why that’s a requirement. It’s in this manner that you’ll know what happens with every toy when they burn. Secondly, you must achieve a certain amount of combos.\n\nA combo in the case of Little Inferno is when you burn two or three like items based on a list of clues. The clues, and the solutions, are relatively simple. The only trick is digging through your growing library of toys to discover which toys are more applicable. Such as, one clue might call for a Sorority Party. Throw in the Low Self-Esteem Action Doll with the Balloons and you’re one step closer to unlocking the next catalog.\n\nWhen you purchase an item from the catalog, it doesn’t immediately appear in your inventory. It takes time. The post office doesn’t react instantaneously, even in this world. Things may take anywhere from 20 seconds to several minutes to arrive at your doorstep. Don’t want to wait? Stamps are available to rush delivery, but they are not infinite. There will be times when the only way to proceed is waiting, sitting in front of the fireplace.\n\nSomehow through all of this there is a story. There is a lengthy epilogue that provides a surprisingly satisfactory conclusion to the game. It’s the kind of ending that encourages you to look back at the few hours you spent in front of the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace. It’s a strange sort of irony that asks you to question the lack of meaning in something meaningless, but give it time. Think about it some more and you might see how far the metaphor stretches.\n\nAnd then, when you’re all done, what’s there left to do? There’s not much of a reason to play it after you’ve beaten it. Once you’ve set fire to all of the things, all that’s left is to fill out the checklist of combos. And once that’s done, there’s just the never changing fireplace and your catalogs of toys. They may burn brightly, explode in variable screams, changing the colors of the flames into something truly radiant. Then the flames die out, and there’s nothing left to do but buy more toys and set them on fire again. And again. And again.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 9, 2014","true","3.5"," 25 of 38 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","25","38","0","0"

Burn things that you always want to drop in fire but always hold yourself. Such as glass bottles or soda cans, which blow up after heating. This game has a good physics. You "feel" all things that you burn: thin and lightweight items like a photos burn in a moment becoming an ashes, wooden objects will burn longer.\n\nI like game artwork and style: mix of retro and scaring motives.\nLittle Inferno also has a storyline and challenges so you will not be bored.\n\nThis game also allows you to upload your own pictures from your PC or from social network sites.\n\nOhh.. look like someone would pay for his sins. *evil laugh*\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=270392046","June 13, 2014","true","4.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's a game of discovery." That is exactly what the game is. I've read that some people were disappointed, claiming that the game felt like it was missing something or lacking, but it's all in the eye of the beholder. I was perfectly pleased and fell in love with it. There's not a lot of challenge to it, if any, but there is a lot of beauty and discovery and fun for the curious who like to experiment. This is not a game for the people who crave constant action or stimulation. If anything, Little Inferno will soothe and calm you. There's something very relaxing about watching the objects burn, and the atmosphere has a very ambient feel despite wondering about the sinister intentions behind your Little Inferno Fireplace that was given to you by a big company, Tomorrow Corporation, that you know very little about. But the premise is that the world around you is freezing, and you have to keep burning things to stay warm and farther more, although it's unspoken, most likely to stay alive.\n\nThis game is often described as a "Fireplace simulator," but there's a little more to it than that. It has a plot with a few surprises with a twist that left me surprised and emotional. On top of that, watching things burn never grow tiring. In fact, they often burn with pizzazz. There are a lot of unexpected outcomes, from sounds, to special effects, to beautifully colored flames. You'll be excited to burn the next thing to see how it reacts.","December 16, 2013","true","13.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","4"

No no, don't deny it, we can all tell it's true.  Fortunately, Little Inferno has your pyromaniac needs covered.\n\nThe concept is simple: order things from a catalog with money.  Put those things in a fireplace.  Burn those things.  The act of burning those things earns you more money than you paid for them.  Repeat.  No time limits, no points system, no one telling you OMG DO THIS NOW.  Burn, burn, and burn some more.\n\nThat's not to say there's nothing else to the game.  There's combos to create to unlock achievements, along with stamps that help your ordered items arrive faster. Money also lets you purchase access to more items, as well as expand the number of items you can hold at once.  And believe it or not, there IS a plot, given mostly through letters you receive in the mail, along with an epilogue that is a surprising gameplay shift, but still fits in just fine.\n\nYou don't have to do any of that though: you're welcome to just burn things without purpose for as long as you like. Doing so is surprisingly entertaining, and really, there are worse reasons to play a game.","December 21, 2013","true","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Then you buy more stuff and burn that too. Repeat.\n\nHave you ever sat in front of the fire and just watched the flames flicker or the embers glow? I found myself becoming very relaxed while playing this game, just enjoying the peace that comes from gazing silently into a warm, crackling fire. It's so calm and relaxing... until...\n\nBLAM!! EXPLOSION! Well, what did you think was going to happen when you put batteries into your fire? Now you hearing screaming, you say? You didn't, perchance, just burn a school bus, hmm?\n\nThere is a cute, endearing little story attached to this game. After you finish playing the "end-game," you can return to your fireplace and go back to burning stuff again. Because burning stuff is awesome.\n\nBurning specific items together can produce more interesting results. Much fun is to be had burning sets of items, looking for the right combinations. And even if you don't discover a new combo, hey, you still got to have fun burning stuff!!\n\nBurning things always gives you in-game currency (as does squishing spiders), so you literally never run out of money.

Just like World of Goo, the developers have taken amazingly addictive gameplay in which you throw toys and expired food into a fireplace and burn them to get money and stamps to order more; and threaded an intriguing story into it, almost imperceptibly. They force you to think, not just about what items to burn together to unlock combos, but about why you are doing what you are doing.

And love.\n\nIt's a cute tale of the girl next door in a very strange world.  Or something...  I'm really not sure what the story is all about, but it is rather cute.  Essentially you have a pen-pal with your next door neighbor, however you can't go outside and meet her because of the dense smog making it impossible to move.  So instead you order things in the mail to burn in your fireplace to keep warm during the artificial winter.  You burn different combinations of things for different effects, and every so often your pen-pal will write you a letter, sometimes containing a gift.  Which you burn, you monster.\n\nThe graphics are very appealing and burning things is always fun.  Even if you don't want to burn stuff, you can always play with the stuff to burn.  Options include various children's toys, one such as building blocks.  If you really wanted to, you could play with those and build yourself a fort.  And then burn it.  There really isn't much left to seek out from what your given.  The game has everything you could want from it.\n\nIf you're a pyromaniac, you might as well give it a go.

You have a fireplace. You order toys and other objects from catalogs not to play with, but to burn. Sometimes, the mailman brings letters from the neighbors. You'll burn those, too.\n\nIt's a little bit creepy and, yes, entertaining. Is there more to this game? Yes. No. Both, I think.\n\nFans of Kyle Gabler's earlier work, "World of Goo", will recognize a similar smug poke at the things we take for granted in this always-online age, but I don't mean to suggest that there is somehow more of a game here than "burning stuff." Suffice to say that there are varying levels of interaction going on with the things you burn. I don't think that's a spoiler. It's game enough that there is a beginning, a middle, and an end.\n\nHowever, the artistic style and soundtrack are the true star of this game. My daughter walked in on me playing, and within 10 seconds she asked "Is that a new game from World of Goo?" Gabler's artwork and music are immediately recognizable.\n\nJust as in "World of Goo", the art of Little Inferno defines a warm and unsettling world, where a fun game with simple mechanics is just the exposed surface of a much larger world gone awry. Or... not! These games can be played by a 5-year-old, but jaded adults will naturally seek deeper meaning.","March 17, 2013","true","4.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Absolutely charming and lovingly crafted. I've had few gaming experiences quite as rewarding and intriguing. The simple, talkative exposition via letters is pitch perfect and the holds together perfectly with the gentle score and cute visuals. The story does take some oddly dark turns and some of the visuals are mildly creepy (not for young kids, without being anything bad.. just not all sweetness) which I actually enjoyed as it made the plot all the more interesting.\n\nI can see this is not a game for everyone. It's short, simple and lots of text to read. But if you take the time to enjoy it it's a fine experience.\n\nThe Good:\n*Simple mechanics, fire looks and works great\n*Charming visuals, music and characters\n*Each item burns differently.\n*Builds a world though letters and descriptive writing\n*Dark plot twists and creepy toys add interest\n*Combo system is rewarding to puzzle out\n*Superb, rewarding and unexpected finale\n\nThe Bad:\n*Could be longer, all over in a 4-6 hours\n*Some combos are really hard to figure out\n*The darker elements of the toys and story can be off-putting\n\nRecommended for: anyone with a love of simple, elegant puzzle games with beautifully crafted stories.\n\nConclusion.\n8/10.

Perhaps at the beginning it seems to be a tedious task, however behind the fireplace smoke hides great storyline which is revealed thanks to a little girl that sends a various letter to us. Many of them are very funny but sometimes they can make you really sad and shocked. I would like to say more but that could be a spoiler ;). You should check it yourself.\n\nThe whole gameplay with an awesome music and nice smooth animation makes an enthralling atmoshpere. Maybe not for everyone but very enjoyable and relaxing game.

But should you do the same? I'm not sure.\n\nThis is definitely one of those "love it or hate it" games (if it can even be called a game). I personally loved it, but I wonder how many others will. On one hand, the gameplay consists of burning things... lots and lots of things. This is an act of primal enjoyment for most human beings. But on the other hand, that's really all there is to it (for the most part). I mean that literally - the entire 4+ hour game consists of burning things in a fireplace. I know that sounds boring, but it's actually kind of not. It's fun to throw different items in to see what they do, and finding combinations of items that, when burned together, reward you with tons of cash and more items. How much mileage others will get out of that experience I can't even being to predict.\n\nAside from burning things, the only other notable aspect of the game is its story (which for 90% of the time takes place more in the background). The end of the game changes this significantly, but I shan't say more about that ;). The story is a sort of societal commentary built of mounds of metaphors (some subtle, some not so much), with a major revelation at the end... basically, it's the kind of thing that goes over well with the "artsy" crowd. I dug it, but again, I'm just not sure how that translates to a mainstream audience. It does, however, lend itself perfectly to the overall atmosphere of the experience (along with the unique art style and music).\n\nIf you're open to unique indie experiences and don't mind the $15 price tag, go for it. Just be warned that there's not all that much to it. World of Goo, this most definitely is not - but it's definitely something very unique (in its own very, very weird and addicting way), and all-in-all, a worthy successor.","November 25, 2012","true","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

As long as you just burn one of each item, you'll get to the end. Each item has a "delivery timer", which makes the "game" go fairly slowly. Discovering combos gives you the ability to speed up these timers, but that's the ONLY thing finding the combos actually provides.\n\nI figured something more would happen when I unlocked all the combos and was pretty disappointed that the Combos are otherwise completely pointless and just meaningless padding to turn what would otherwise be an hour-long game into a few hours of trial-and-error (some of the combos make sense, others are VERY obtuse).\n\nAfter burning one of each item, you get a long cutscene at the end that starts great and should have ended after the first 2 minutes, but then goes on try too hard to have multiple layers of meaning. The surface meaning of "don't waste your life playing video games" is enough, they really shouldn't have tried so hard otherwise at the end.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that while it's a great looking game, it's just not really worth the effort to "play".","May 21, 2014","false","4.4"," 20 of 37 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","20","37","0","1"

Five minutes of watching stuff burn and then you begin experimenting with other things and see how they burn away in to the flames. From a game point of view it's a very shallow amount of gameplay and even for a short game (depending on how fast you combine certan items to burn to fill a check list) it feels like it over stays it's welcome. The novelty of burning stuff wears off fast and once completing the game you are given what I'll expect is supposed to be a meaningful story covered in whimsy and a burton-esque theme but comes off as a desperate attempt at social commentary.\nYes we get how destroying material objects in order to gain more is a look in to our own lives and how we live in society but it's not really adding to the entertainment of the game in question.\n\nI enjoyed Little Inferno for ten minutes.

Little inferno is a great example of a pointless, addicting game! Little Inferno lets you burn things, which gives you money, so you can buy more things to burn! Pointless? Obviously, but the game has you hooked to it for about an hours worth of playing! It is most ideal to play this game when you are either bored of playing your usual games in your steam library or just for a bit of fun! The graphics for this game have a realistic, cartoon-ish tone to them, plus a nice, hot, glowing fire! The gameplay is pretty easy to learn to, as all you have to do is click your mouse for fire, and the chain-reaction lets you watch the fire burn down into crumbly black ashes. Little inferno is an average game in my opinion yet it kept me watching my computer screen and holding onto my mouse the whole time! Overall, Little Inferno is an average, basic puzzle with new and unique gameplay that gets me addicted everytime!\n\nLittle Inferno's Rating is as Followed:\nGameplay: 6/10\nGraphics: 4/10\nLandscape: 4/10\nUniqueness: 8/10\nFun I Had Playing It!: 7.5/10\n\nOverall:\n5.9/10\nC\n\nYours sincerly,\nLiam","September 5, 2014","true","13.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is absolutely brilliant. Before the brilliance, however, a few words of warning to the wary buyer. There's a fair amount of waiting in the game, and the puzzles you complete to progress are by no means difficult. If this does not trouble you at all, then stop reading this review right now and buy the game.\n\nFor those who remain, I present some positives. Little Inferno isn't the most technologically advanced software ever, but it looks very pretty. The bright fire effects and "JUST BURN EVERYTHING" gameplay will satisfy your inner child and pyromaniac alike. The things you're burning are quite entertaining in themselves. The game gives each a humorous name and description, and each reacts to being set on fire in a different way. An alarm clock rings until its untimely demise, a model bank churns out money, and firecrackers do exactly what you think they'd do.\n\nSo, LIttle Inferno is a solid fireplace simulator. But is that it? Is it worth $10? Go watch the trailer, and think about it. There is most definitely something more. As you start up the game, Kyle Gabler's incredible soundtrack dares you to say otherwise. And that is exactly everything I can say about that without ruining it.\n\ntl;dr\nLittle Inferno is great. There's fires, and a bunch of other really great stuff that you need to play to find out for yourself, so go buy it. Also, the soundtrack is amazing.","January 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Leetle Inferno does a wonderful job of defining a tone and setting with minimal effort. Rarely have I felt so directly connected to a game's protagonist.\n\nWhat leetle plot/character development exists is suprisingly compelling. As the story is so brief and simplistic, to say pretty much anything would be a spoiler. But to indicate that a game in which the only action you can take is to burn things in a fireplace is even capable of having spoilers should be compelling enough.\n\nLeetle Inferno is simultaneously comforting, creepy, inspirational and depressing. I've completed the game and am still unsure whether or not it's "fun".

The art is goofy and beautiful, the humor is snappy and perverse, and the video message at the end of the first act will haunt your dreams for a week.\nDoesn't have much replay value because the story is tied to the sandbox mode.

Some of the combinations are well thought out and even the ones that aren't are fun to look for. If you like watching things explode and absurd imagery you'll like this game. The ending is sweet and satisfying and the game play is fun even though it's extremely simple in concept. Partially this is due to the art direction being very consistent throughout the game. I had a lot more fun playing this game with a friend or two in the room coming up with silly combinations to burn with me.\n\nThe game benefits from knowing just how weird its premise is and running with it.\n\nUnfortunately once you've gotten all the combinations it doesn't have a lot of replay value as the story is linear and there are a set number of specialized interactions. But it takes awhile to get all those combinations and it's more than worth it for that first play through.\n\nIt also runs on well on even low powered machines.

Little Inferno is a pyromaniac's toy, involving the burning of objects ordered from catalogues. That's the basic description of the gameplay, but there's a deeper story involving children who are endlessly amusing them by constantly buying junk to burn in their "Little Inferno Fireplace". From what I read on the web, the game is a satire of casual gaming and while I see hints of that in some of the items you buy, it didn't seem blatant that it was making fun of microtransaction gameplay (other than making you buy items, but at least those items will give you more money than what you paid, instead of arbitrary time to spend in a game), so I think the joke falls short. There's a deeper message to be found through your communication with a neighbor who is also "playing the game" and what happens to her once she burns her house down due to playing too much.\n\nYou start with a fireplace, a catalogue, a small inventory. You start out buy burning toe terms of service and end user's license agreement which results in a little money to order from the catalogue. All items can be burned for money that results in a profit. The orders are delivered to you over a set time frame and once recieved, can be opened and thrown in to the fireplace in which you can burn them with left click (your only control). The most amusing part is just burning various items and seeing how they react to each other and what item combos are named after burning related items - which give you stamps to have items delivered to you faster. This does however, make me wish an indie dev would make a similar, higher fidelity game that would take advantage of better PC system specs and a modding community.\n\nI had fun with this game, including being able to burn photos from my network of friends on Facebook, and the humorous tone of the items delivered and the overall experience of the game - not to mention the game does a great job burning items in a beautiful display of fire. I was able to finish this game in 4 hours, which is all I needed, though, there is more replayability through an alternate ending and finding all the combos.","November 23, 2013","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vixzends/recommended/221260/","vixzends","Vixzen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vixzends/","790 products in account","Little Inferno is a toybox game. There aren't any set objectives, there aren't any rules, just pick up your toys, throw them into the fire, and burn them. Ultimately that is the premise to the entire game however there is more to it than that.\n\nYou begin with a small number of toys available to order from a catalog, and you can unlock more toys in that catalog by earning money, and you earn money by burning toys. The more toys you burn, the more you can buy, and so on and so forth. You can only 'hold' so many toys in your inventory at one time, however you can increase the size of your inventory by spending some of your money which makes the game a little easier as you progress.\n\nThere are numerous other toy catalogs that you can unlock playing the game, but to do so you also have to work out combinations of toys to burn together from combo names which are given to you. Making combinations of burning toys will not only unlock catalogs it will also give you stamps, and these stamps can be used to reduce the time it takes for your toys to arrive once you have ordered them from the catalog - these stamps are invaluable when you get to ordering toys from the very last unlockable catalog as some of the delivery times are around 4 minutes, and this does start to feel like a long time to wait particularly when your toy goes up in a smoke in a number of seconds.\n\nThere is a story throughout the game which isn't particularly obvious until right at the very end, and I won't include any spoilers here as I think it needs to be played to be experienced. I found it quite moving, and the whole experience very enjoyable.\n\nThis game is fairly short - I managed to complete it in 3 1/2 hours, but I hadn't worked out all of the stamp combos, and I'm actually already keen to go and play it again so I can work the remaining ones out as some combo names are quite cryptic (whereas some are blatantly obvious).\n\nThis game is £6.99 on Steam and this is a lot of money for a short game, however I do think if you connect with the gameplay and the story there is scope for replay-ability, and certainly once you've unlocked everything you can just leave it as a 'toy' in itself to pick up and play whenever you fancy burning something on-screen.\n\nLittle Inferno is simplistic, it looks great, it's fun, it's challenging, it's polished, it's thought-provoking. I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish, and would definitely recommend giving it a try. It's something that can be played in one sitting, or something you can come back to, either way it's definitely something that should be experienced.","May 8","true","5.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

Yes, you get to throw stuff into a fireplace. A lot of things, in fact. But way, way into the center of it all there's also a storyline to be found. I won't spoil it so I'll just talk about the gameplay a little bit more. While burning things you'll earn coins and stamps. You see, all items have to be ordered and the stamps will give you the ability to instantly deliver an item to your doorstep. Coins can, of course, be used to buy items or increase the number of objects you can stock.\nA few hours into the game these items will dramatically increase in price.\n\nNow, the real goal is to find and create combos. Combining certain items will unlock an achievement and earn you lots of money. And what for ? To buy new items, you got it ! These combos are a must if you want to complete the game, by the way.\n\nMost gamers should be able to finish it in 3,5 hours or so. So it's not all that long, and the time limit for deliveries artificially lengthens the game as well, which is a real shame.\n\nThe graphics and animations are cute and beautiful. And the fire looks quite amazing, with all the ashes and whatnot. Impressive stuff if you ask me.\n\nThe music is minimal, but memorable. Especially the Weather Balloon song got my attention.\nAll in all it's a fun game but I wish it was even deeper than this. It's still a bit too shallow for my taste.\n\n[Rating: 78/100]","December 8, 2012","true","3.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

You're given a fireplace and an eternal, somehow, lighter. Your job is to burn as many things as you can to earn coins and finding combos.\n\nGetting combos is how you move forward, and the trickiest of them all. If you don't cheat by looking at FAQ list, this can be time consuming. To buy the next recipe list you must complete a certain number of combos - going to be irritating if you can't get that last hint and find the combo.\n\nThe artificial timer intended to stop you from doing combos too fast is also annoying. Well, it's the weakest part of the game IMHO.\n\nGame has no storyline except some obscure dialogues between silent protagonist (you), weather news reporter.... and an annoying neighbor.\n\nOverall not worth full price though - and this game's bundle material so you might want to wait and clear your backlog before purchasing.\n\n6/10","April 4, 2015","true","7.1"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StopMuroTime/recommended/221260/","StopMuroTime","Muro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StopMuroTime/","196 products in account","I keep a positive approach to indie developers, especially if they already created something I enjoyed. My attitude here was "World of Goo was great. A second game from the same dev? A must have!". And perhaps because of expecting a similar quality of gameplay, I was ultimately underwhelmed.\n\nThe mentioned gameplay is as simple as it gets. Buy things -> burn them -> receive slightly more money than you spent on it -> buy more things -> repeat ad infinitum. Some items here and there react a bit more interestingly then others when burned, but in the case of most of them it's about what you'd expect - they catch fire, turn to ash, end.\n\nThere's no challenge, no timer, no optional objectives a la WoG's OCDs, nothing that really requires you to pay attention. It is definitely much more casual than WoG, though not necessarily more family friendly - some toys screaming (even if cartoonishly) when burned "alive" can be quite creepy. Which is good, as it helps stay awake during the game.\n\nThe game is short - which wouldn't be bad by itself, but it's short despite being already artificially dragged out by time delays between buying items and receiving them (from several second at first to up to about 4,5 minutes for more expensive items). Game takes about 3h to finish, whereas it would take perhaps 30 minutes without the waiting times - and it would be a considerably more enjoyable experience in that case. Between a 30 minutes of well-paced engaging fun and a 3h game in which I regularly alt-tab to keep myself busy while waiting for cooldowns to end, I'd take the former any day.\n\nTo give credit where credit is due, the game is visually pleasing + has a theme song I occasionally catch myself humming. There is definitely a good dose of creativity put into the aesthetics of Little Inferno. But though I don't regret playing it, I find it hard to recommend to anyone due to the ultimately dull and unrewarding gameplay.","February 19","false","8.8"," 16 of 30 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","16","30","2","1"

Main purpose of the game is to burn various objects which reacts with fire. Each objects react differently with fire and It is very entertaining to watch. As you unlock more and more things to burn, the mystery behind the reason you burn things unveil, and the message behind the game was definitely something to think on about. The game does get a bit repetitive when it requires you to burn same objects again and again in order to move on, but overall, I'd say this game was a great experience, and I recommend this game.","August 2, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Then buy more stuff and burn that too. Sounds pretty boring right? So why is this game so damn enjoyable? Well because they make burning combinations of items rewarding, that's why. And finding combinations by trial-and-error makes it feel like a puzzle game. Plus there's actually a story in all of this that extends it further than just burning stuff. Very soothing music as well. Little Inferno is certainly a pleasant surprise.","June 1, 2013","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I feel the need to disclose that because I think it shows that I have a subconscious bias towards a game such as Little Inferno, which rewards you for experimenting with setting things on fire. That being said I honestly do think this charming little pyro simulator is worth your time and money. The actual burning of things is very entertaining and dare I say relaxing. The fire is very pleasing visually and the items you burn often have very interesting reactions to the immolation. My only gripe with the core mechanic is that the grinding to get all the secret fire combinations can be a bit tedious, and for a few really obscure combinations I had to resort to the internet.\n\nAt the end of it all though, you’re treated to a truly touching narrative conclusion, while that final cutscene was playing I had genuine chills running down my spine. For all the silly, fiery goodness, the conclusion to the tale was what made me completely satisfied with my purchase.","October 3, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ONE thing I would change about it is the fact coins and those tickets are involed. When I first started it up, I though I was playing some highly-microtransaction pay-to-win type games but eventually it started to make sense ( this game has no microtransactions btw). Never once in the game did it feel like I was just grinding through trying to get the most coins, the levels and objects were very fun to play with and getting all 99 combos was fun as hell.

I've never done that. What started out as a fun-enough little novelty game about burning things, slowly evolved into one of the most unique, interesting, engaging and moving gaming experiences I've ever had. While you're merrily going along, thoughtlessly setting fire to all manner of objects, (and attempting to figure out some of the charming little burn combos along the way) you'll notice the game is beginning to draw you in on a deeper level. There is a story here. There is someone to care about. There are quirky and interesting characters, and ultimately there is an ending which is thought-provoking, humorous, and beautiful.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Come for the fire.

The game consists of you buying new items from different catalogues and basically ..... burn them and receive more coins than you spent on the item. It can get repetitive at some point but in my case it really doesnt matter because i just continue on playing and playing until i eventually get bored. Here are the pros and cons.\n\nPros:\n\n- There are no time trials or some sort of score system .. you just burn and burn until you get bored\n- Alot of items that you can burn. From a picture frame .... to a space shuttle XD.\n- The story is simple yet amazing and it makes you feel like your in the game because you receive letters from your neighbor and from the weather man that consist of fun and well writen dialogues.\n- When you finish the story you can still continue burning stuff without any barriers.\n- It has super meat boy in the form of a cardboard but out ...\n- You can burn spam E-mails or even ad pop ups ...\n- Really trick combos than you can figure out\n\nCons:\n\n- Some items take more than 2mins to arrive and it only takes about 10sec to burn\n- 4hr story maybe ??\n- letters can be anoyying at a point\n- When you finish the game you just burn stuff or either do the story over again\n\n\nIn a small paragraph... even tough this game is short it is still one of the very best desgined indie game i ever played and also has a cute story XD so i would recommend this game to any indie lover.\n\n9/10\n","September 16, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was shocked to see how well the fire mechanics work and some of the items are really fun to burn or burn together. The burning alone is good for a few hours of fun.\n\nThe combos are basically the only gameplay. There is no conflict. All you do is gather coins to buy things to burn. Burning 2 or more of certain items at the same time scores a combo which gets you express tickets to get items you buy delivered faster. A certain number of combos are required to unlock new catalogs full of new things to burn. There is a combo list you can reference that gives you hints on items to experiment with.\n\nThere is a small story wrapped up in the game that reveals itself to you over time. The game also has a pretty decent (if long) ending cutscene/activity to reward you for your efforts.\n\nAlso, if you are given a coupon for a "Free Hug", you might not want to burn it. Just a hint.

The player is simply tasked with ordering items from a catalog and then burning them in the Little Inferno fireplace. The challenge comes from unlocking more advanced item catalogs, which require a certain amount of burn combinations to access, but you're really here to just be a virtual pyromaniac. Item design is excellent -- I love the screams from the school bus -- and the game's gradually unfolding story (told via snailmail letters) keeps you enthralled to the end. Little Inferno lacks the replayability of World of Goo, but it's an excellent experience on its own.","February 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gyumaou/recommended/221260/","Gyumaou","Gyumaou","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gyumaou/","2510 products in account","Well, I'll start with the good points. And probably the best aspect of the game are the graphics, the flame effects in particular. You'd expect that, right? In a game that's all about setting various things on fire that's probably a must. And the game delivers on that, the flame effects are very well done and looking quite realistic. Looking into the fire as it consumes each and every object placed in the fireplace has that mesmerising quality that real fire has. Or at the very least it's quite close.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148662242\n\nUnfortunately that's the only good point for me. After all, it's a game all about setting things on fire. It's fun the first few times, it's fun as you discover new items to burn, but beyond that I found little entertainment in it. There is only one fireplace that doesn't really change through the game, and all the items take time to arrive, completing the simulated mail-order feeling. Sure, there's special stamps that can be used to instantly get the item, but these dwindle fast past the initial boom and getting them later requires completing combos (burn specific sets of items at the same time to get 1-3 stamps) -- a sort of an in-game achievement.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148739036\n\nContrary to what it seems the game does have a story to it, not a very robust and deep one, but I guess it's enough to serve as background for the pyromaniac frenzy that is the main point of the game. The story advances as more items are burnt and new ones are unlocked and finally reaches an end, offering a short epilogue in the form of a mini point and click adventure.\n\nI can't say I disliked the game, I did enjoy it for a short time, even made myself finish the story. It just doesn't have enough to make me come back. But I suppose it might be a decent choice for a slow chillout evening when anything more than mindless clicking is just too tiring.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBonus: since you can add your own images to picture frames (burnable), yeah you can do this too:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148751819","February 27, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite it's minimalism, you can tell a lot of care went into the game. From the unique ways each item burns, to the combo system, to the corky dialouge. Now, the game doesn't have the same length World of Goo had. I'm 5 hours into the game right now and I've earned gold status (another clever way to get you hooked on buying items) on everything in the catalouge and only have 10 combos left to discover. But if you find this item on sale, $5 is well worth the purchase. Heck, $10 is even worth it if you plan to play it more than once (and HINT, you will have a reason too). This will indulge your basic human desire to burn things for hours. I recommend it highly.","December 31, 2013","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is also one of my favorite games from my library (which currently consists of 236 games). It tells an amazing and unexpected story and looks into some deep and concerning things. Whether you want to burn random things they supply in their item catalouge and see what happens, burn your own pictures in your own personal inferno, or follow along with it's interesting story. I can confidently recommend this game to anyone of any age or interest. I view it as a must play. A strait play through for me took 3 hours, but I still see replay value in it, and will more than likely play it again.","April 7, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bendomino/recommended/221260/","bendomino","Mr. Domino","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bendomino/","805 products in account","Little Inferno is an odd quasi-puzzle game with a similar style and consumerism narrative as World of Goo, 2D Boy's previous acclaimed release. The player is simply tasked with ordering items from a catalog and then burning them in the Little Inferno fireplace. The challenge comes from unlocking more advanced item catalogs, which require a certain amount of burn combinations to access, but you're really here to just be a virtual pyromaniac. Item design is excellent -- I love the screams from the school bus -- and the game's gradually unfolding story (told via snailmail letters) keeps you enthralled to the end. Little Inferno lacks the replayability of World of Goo, but it's an excellent experience on its own.","February 27, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And probably the best aspect of the game are the graphics, the flame effects in particular. You'd expect that, right? In a game that's all about setting various things on fire that's probably a must. And the game delivers on that, the flame effects are very well done and looking quite realistic. Looking into the fire as it consumes each and every object placed in the fireplace has that mesmerising quality that real fire has. Or at the very least it's quite close.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148662242\n\nUnfortunately that's the only good point for me. After all, it's a game all about setting things on fire. It's fun the first few times, it's fun as you discover new items to burn, but beyond that I found little entertainment in it. There is only one fireplace that doesn't really change through the game, and all the items take time to arrive, completing the simulated mail-order feeling. Sure, there's special stamps that can be used to instantly get the item, but these dwindle fast past the initial boom and getting them later requires completing combos (burn specific sets of items at the same time to get 1-3 stamps) -- a sort of an in-game achievement.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148739036\n\nContrary to what it seems the game does have a story to it, not a very robust and deep one, but I guess it's enough to serve as background for the pyromaniac frenzy that is the main point of the game. The story advances as more items are burnt and new ones are unlocked and finally reaches an end, offering a short epilogue in the form of a mini point and click adventure.\n\nI can't say I disliked the game, I did enjoy it for a short time, even made myself finish the story. It just doesn't have enough to make me come back. But I suppose it might be a decent choice for a slow chillout evening when anything more than mindless clicking is just too tiring.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBonus: since you can add your own images to picture frames (burnable), yeah you can do this too:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=148751819","February 27, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/recommended/221260/","amedeus8","Comrade St. Nikolai","http://steamcommunity.com/id/amedeus8/","779 products in account","Little Inferno is an oddball. It's funny, it's quirky, it's dark, and it's disconcerting. It's also short. I finished it in just under five hours, and you could probably shave a few hours off of that if you ignored all but the required number of Combo Badges. On top of which, there's very little here to call a proper game, and gameplay mostly just consists of placing things in the fireplace, and then burning them for fun and prizes. "Prizes" in this case referring to more things to burn, money with which to buy more things to burn, and stamps for speeding up the delivery of more things to burn.\n\nIt's the ciiiircle of liiiife! And it burns us aaaall!\n\nThat said, there's a lot of variety to make it interesting, and you're never really positive how a new item will react when you set it on fire or throw it around. I burnt a floppy disk, which caused my fire to become pixelated, and a coffee cup I set ablaze spontaneously grew a face and began screaming. Which brings me to a point: This game is disturbing when it wants to be. On the whole, though, it's all cartoony enough that I think you won't leave your comfort zone.\n\nThe categories of items are interesting. There's a video game category, of course, and it contains little references, like World of Goo goo balls and a tablet which displays a Duck Hunt nod. My favorite category, however, is the one filled with manly things, such as a monster truck, a flamethrowing chainsaw, and a moustache. And I burned them all.\n\nSo, what's the point? Well, besides just burning things and seeing what happens (which is kind of its own reward), there are 99 2- or 3-item combos to figure out based on the combo's name alone. These will probably take up the majority of your time. There is also, actually, a plot, told mainly through letters until the endgame, which is... surprisingly different. The ending does what it needs to. It won't answer that feeling you'll get while playing the game that there's something bigger going on here than just people keeping warm, but it gives you a personal conclusion that's a little more than "Try to guess what happened for yourself!" Which, considering the tendencies of indie games these days, is a glorious gift.\n\nThere's an underlying message to be picked up on, as well. It's a message which rings true, and while it's one that I've seen in various forms in indie games before, I think this is the best presentation I've seen it given, yet.\n\nLittle Inferno's a short game, but it's good entertainment, if pretty basic in the gameplay department. It'll hold your attention until it's over, but if you're worried about the short length over price, well, that's what Steam sales are for.","May 30, 2013","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's only a couple of hours long but it sells an environment that is a little bleak, a little funny and suprisingly, a little uplifting. It's an obvious allegory for mobile games (I think this was actually released for mobile too) and their business practices but it isn't as cynical as most games when tackling issues (*cough* GTA V) and in a way that makes it kind of a feel good game. I mean sure you're burning hundreds of spiders alive and such but that tone changes at the end in a way I didn't expect that made me feel genuinely happy.\n\nIt's a small enjoyable game for a low price. 5$ is where it should be. If you've got a couple hours to spare and want a real, not-boring cohesive experience, well then here you go.","December 28, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Rinse, repeat.\n\nHowever, during the course of the game, a depressing story with dark undertones beguns to unfold through messages sent to you from neighbors who are also sitting around, burning things in their fireplaces.\n\nLittle Inferno took me by surprise.  It's deceptively simple, yet I suddenly found myself with over 2 hours invested into it my first time around.  It went very fast.\n\nI haven't completed the game yet, but I am drawn back to it like a month to a flame.","March 20, 2013","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

The art style is very incredible and given that there are only two parts to the entire game, (one of which is literally staring into a fireplace) the game is very easy to run on low end devices such as a netbook for example. The aim of the game is to collect combonations of items by burning them together in the fireplace whilst getting the occasional message from one of the three known characters that speak to you:\nA love interest with bad typing, a repetitive weatherman and a C.E.O.\n\nThere are ninety-nine of these combos and a very evasive one-hundreth.\n\nThere are no options to tweek the game to what you wish, not that you need them really in a mobile port. I would have liked to see an audio remover of the sort so that I could play my own music without the light-hearted rumpus in the background. Then again, If I could play the game for six hours in one sitting, nothing much is wrong with said music.\n\n\nVERDICT:\nIs a good time-waster. If you have to download a game, pop on the 'Allow downloads during gameplay' setting and launch this for the time you have to wait. I would see the need to play this for a second time unless perhaps you are showcasing this to freinds or Subscribers. However, should it be the first time you have ever played or seen the game, certainly an eventful 6-7 hrs should you play it in one sitting like myself. Thus, this game receives a ****/***** rating from me. Not five because after all, it's a mobile port.\n\nWARNING: Induces Pyromania, like I am not even joking.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\nThe Tucker","December 13, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Burn things.\nIf you're like me you can easily spend the rest of your life playing this game. It's just so god damn satsifying to burn all the stuff. And all of the stuff you get to burn!\n\nSo anyway, the story is:\nThe world is getting colder and it is constantly snowing and nobody knows why. The Tomorrow Corporation has taken it upon themselves to create a device (and a bunch of items for it) that keeps people warm. It is the Little Inferno Entertainment Fireplace! What do you do with it? You buy things from the company with their currency and burn them in said fireplace!\n\nAfter you burned everything and discovered the hidden combo there's quite a bit of story at the end but I won't spoiler anything.\n\nIf you're a pyromaniac or you just find it absolutely satisfying to watch things burn (and scream in the process) then I advise you to: GET.

The nonsensical, comical game style makes the game highly enjoyable and addictive. The objective of the game is to burn various items in your fireplace in return for coins, with which you buy more items to burn! When you burn certain items together you will unlock combos, these give you extra coins and when you get ebough you are able to purchase a new catalogue containing new items to burn!\nWhen put like that the game does not sound very enjoyable, however the way in which the items react just makes you want to see more of the game.\nTomorrow Corp also add in another couple of characters who you get to meet and develope relationships with as the game progresses including an annoying but lovable neighbour who circums to a tregedy later on in the game.\nThe game play is very responsive and you do not need a good computer to run the game. The colourful design gives the game a very positive atmosphere, which seems to be uncommon in newer games.\nThe only down critisism that I have for this game is that it does not take a long time to complete, if you do not focus on unlocking all of the combos you could complete the game in little over 2 hours. But, if you wish to piece together all of the clues than you would have to spend a lot more time on the game.\nTo conclude:\nLittle Inferno if a brilliant and unique game, it includes a lot of fun puzzles to solve and will keep someone entertained for a number of hours. It's relaxed game style means you are able to play it without having to stay and "finish this bit" as it saves the game as you go.\nGraphics: 8/10 Fun but still detailed and high quality\nFun: 9/10  You can spend alot of time on this simple game and not get bored\nOveral: 6.5/10 Superb game but it is a little short for my liking.\n\nI would recommend this game to all people, exept children who are easily distressed/upset.","May 6, 2015","true","36.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's one of those "games as art" type of things. The whole concept of the game is you order stuff from a catalog, and set it on fire. Poof! You get coins to order new things, and stamps to get them to you faster. But it's the subtext that's interesting. Your burning things like toys at first, but then you start burning, TVs, radios, e-mail, etc, almost as if you're burning away everything in your life. Get me?\n\nAnd there's also an environmental message in here because the game keeps talking about smoky skies and how it's been snowing for as long as anyone can remember. Hmm.....wonder what that could be, eh?\n\nIt's not worth $9.99, not at all. It's interesting but it only took me 4-5 hours over the course of two days to beat it.

You have maybe played the game World of Goo? Then this is a game for you!\n\nBasically you have to burn things! First of all I looked at some videos to understand the gameplay before I brought the game. It's all about burning things in combination.\nAn example: You get money for burning things and you have to ""level"" your character. You level while you're doing combinations like burning a Cat and a Fish together in your furnace to get a combo "Cat Fish".\n\nAfter you have done a certain amount of combos you are able to buy new things for new combos.\n\nThe comic look feels unique and fits into the entire game. The effects of fire and like are really awesome. The game has a story - simple but full of humor.\n\nShamelessly there are no achievements for this game. I'm not sure why there are no achievements, because the developers have enough potential to create achievements for this game. Some proposals would be:\n"Rich man", where you have to collect a certain amount of money.\n"Poor man", where you have no money in your pocket.\n"Crammed", where you have put your entire furnace full of things.\netc.\n\nRecommended!, even if it's not on sale and has no achievements.","June 28, 2015","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is kind of a game? More of a practice of design and artistic statement than a game. There really is not much to Little Inferno. You are a kid and you buy things to burn in your Little Inferno fireplace to stay warm. That's it. It feels like a moble mini-transaction game, but it isn't. I cannot say it is fun, but it is certainly interesting. Well, it is kinda fun for the first little while and getting to see all the different items burned, but this is very short lived. There is something more to it, something that you have to slog through the "game" to find. But this is very intentional to the overall design, so I cannot say that this is a bad thing as you are suppose to become bored and disenchanted with it and it is only after that where the true statement of the game lies. It does what it is designed to do very well. It is very different, certainly not for everyone. But based solely on it's intended purpose and design, it does it very well.

World of Goo was a physics puzzle while here, - here we have an object/word association puzzle.\n\nYou get catalogues of things to burn, and along with a catalogue, you get a list of named combos - and the goal (besides enjoying the.. "burning sensation".. hue) is to guess what things to burn together, based on name of the combo and names/descriptions/behavior in game/presumed functions outside the game/cultural references etc. etc. pertaining to objects from given catalogue and any previously unlocked ones.\n\nAs such, the game is somewhat culturally biased, and perhaps acts as proof that your command of English language is not as good as you might think it is (not sure about other languages?).

It makes it even more fun to burn things in game than it is in real life. Trust me I’m an expert at burning things. Little Inferno is also pretty cheap and compared to burning down houses. Burning a house is hard but Little Inferno provides all the satisfaction with the click of a button (and a bit of moving the mouse).\nThe game is really pretty. I can tell you from experience that the fire effect is even more beautiful than in real life. They must have Leonardo da Vinci working with them because fire is the most beautiful thing in the world and therefore is almost impossible to replicate. I guess the other stuff looks really good too but it’s impossible to make something look as good as fire.\nThe story is really good. Any story with fire is good but this contains good story unrelated to fire which I thought was impossible. It has some message about the environment and how one day our earth might not be feeling so HOT. If the world gets to hot there might be nothing left to burn down and if it gets to cold there might not be enough heat to burn anything which is the reason we should care about our world.\nOverall the best game ever made. 999999999999999999999999999999999999999/10","June 28, 2015","true","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The art style is very incredible and given that there are only two parts to the entire game, (one of which is literally staring into a fireplace) the game is very easy to run on low end devices such as a netbook for example. The aim of the game is to collect combonations of items by burning them together in the fireplace whilst getting the occasional message from one of the three known characters that speak to you:\nA love interest with bad typing, a repetitive weatherman and a C.E.O.\n\nThere are ninety-nine of these combos and a very evasive one-hundreth.\n\nThere are no options to tweek the game to what you wish, not that you need them really in a mobile port. I would have liked to see an audio remover of the sort so that I could play my own music without the light-hearted rumpus in the background. Then again, If I could play the game for six hours in one sitting, nothing much is wrong with said music.\n\n\nVERDICT:\nIs a good time-waster. If you have to download a game, pop on the 'Allow downloads during gameplay' setting and launch this for the time you have to wait. I would see the need to play this for a second time unless perhaps you are showcasing this to freinds or Subscribers. However, should it be the first time you have ever played or seen the game, certainly an eventful 6-7 hrs should you play it in one sitting like myself. Thus, this game receives a ****/***** rating from me. Not five because after all, it's a mobile port.\n\nWARNING: Induces Pyromania, like I am not even joking.\n\n\n\nKind regards,\nThe Tucker","December 13, 2015","true","8.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

You get coins to order new things, and stamps to get them to you faster. But it's the subtext that's interesting. Your burning things like toys at first, but then you start burning, TVs, radios, e-mail, etc, almost as if you're burning away everything in your life.

It's artsy and metaphorical without being pretentious or obtuse.  The metaphors are pretty plain to see: You burn things to get money you can use to buy things you can then burn for more money... But it has to end sometime.  When shopping, it plays 50's era music to get you in the mindless consumerist mindset, to boot.\n\nMost things don't simply burn.  When you burn sausages from the food catalogue, a swarm of flies bursts out, for example, or an ear of corn pops into popcorn.  This adds a little suspense and entertainment to what would otherwise be just a fireplace simulator.\n\nTo give the player something to actually think about, there are "unlockable combos" that really do nothing but give you something to complete.  (There are even exactly 100 of them to complete for 100% completion...)  These are mostly puns or "do you remember these items that share a similar theme from 10 minutes ago?"  I.E. "Polar Bear" requires you burn the South Pole and stuffed bear toys together.\n\nThat said, not to cut into the dev's bread money, but you should probably buy this one on sale - It's not the sort of game that will last you more than a few hours unless you want to replay it or let your friends/family play a second game, and $10 for 2-5 hours of bemusement, especially when a lot of it ultimately amounts to filler, anyway, pushes my tolerance.","February 25","true","4.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonhighwayman/recommended/221260/","demonhighwayman","DemonHighwayman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/demonhighwayman/","230 products in account","It's a simple game, the videos on the store page will give you a good idea of what the gameplay is like - burn things in a fireplace. Expanding a little on that, the idea is that you burn stuff you buy from the games store in combinations which lets you get access to another level of things to burn. And you don't have to worry about running out of in game money to buy stuff from the store as everything you burn gives you money !\n\nSome of the stuff you can burn in your little inferno are really fun, some of the stand outs for me are the mini planets, the cold heart, the nuke, the chainsaw and the valkyrie woman among others.\n\nMy one gripe is there are no options, running at 1000fps isn't really nessesary so a v-sync option would be nice. And the worst for me is no volume control, the inferno itself is rather quiet as you'd expect from a fireplace but when you go to the store to buy supplies the store music is too loud and repetetive this annoys everyone in my house, myself included!\n\nThose are just small complaints though, the game has a humerous and endearing story, fun gameplay and doesn't seem to have any technical faults unlike many other games being sold these days, beware though that for me it only lasted 7.5 hours until completion (I did have to cheat a bit looking up combo's to burn though).","June 16, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was probably one of the best decisions of my life. This game is INCREDIBLY entertaining, as the wacky dialogue has you craving for more, and the crazy items you can get leave you stuck to the screen, trying to get the remaining combos for the next unlockable catalogue.  It is a short game, as I beat it in about 4 hours, but it does have a high replay value, due to the 99 combos you can get, and just the overall stress releaving attitude of the game.  I would say get this if you are into simple games, cause this game will have you craving the aspect of setting things on fire to release you of your pent up stress.","December 28, 2013","true","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Expanding a little on that, the idea is that you burn stuff you buy from the games store in combinations which lets you get access to another level of things to burn. And you don't have to worry about running out of in game money to buy stuff from the store as everything you burn gives you money !\n\nSome of the stuff you can burn in your little inferno are really fun, some of the stand outs for me are the mini planets, the cold heart, the nuke, the chainsaw and the valkyrie woman among others.\n\nMy one gripe is there are no options, running at 1000fps isn't really nessesary so a v-sync option would be nice. And the worst for me is no volume control, the inferno itself is rather quiet as you'd expect from a fireplace but when you go to the store to buy supplies the store music is too loud and repetetive this annoys everyone in my house, myself included!\n\nThose are just small complaints though, the game has a humerous and endearing story, fun gameplay and doesn't seem to have any technical faults unlike many other games being sold these days, beware though that for me it only lasted 7.5 hours until completion (I did have to cheat a bit looking up combo's to burn though).","June 16, 2015","true","7.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Burn ALL Of Your Toys! - An Official Waffle King Review\n~Find more here.[www.nonm.co.uk]\n\nHey, hey, kids! How are you doing today? Are you having fun? No? Are you bored of the internet? Cat pictures and ♥♥♥♥ not enough for you? All these electronics all over the place just white noise getting in the way of your fun? I have an idea!\n\n\nBURN IT ALL. EVERYTHING. HA HA HA. IT'LL BE TONS OF FUN. AND IT'LL KEEP YOU ALL NICE AND TOASTY-WARM. DO IT. BURN ALL OF YOUR TOYS. BURN IT ALL.\n\n\nOh? You can't? Well, why the ♥♥♥♥ not? It's easy, come on, anyone can do it. Here, I'll even get you started. Here's your own little personal, nonstop, high-definition, entertainment fireplace. Little Inferno! (Uproarious screams of feral children)\n\n\nLittle Inferno is the latest indie masterpiece from the geniuses behind World of Goo, over at Tomorrow Corporation. Originally a launch title for the Wii U's eShop, Little Inferno also found a nice home on PC and Mobile.\n\n\nLike its predecessor, Little Inferno is incredibly unique. The art style is noticeably distinct, with a strong Tim Burton vibe. And that style seems to leak into every other aspect of the game in all of the best ways. Your only purpose in the game is to burn everything. Burn it all. Let it all burn. If that doesn't sound like fun to you, why, you may as well be at the bottom of the ocean.\n\n\nLittle Inferno will start you off with the meager instruction manual of the fireplace itself, which will burn pretty quick. But everything you burn will fade to dust, and from that dust will pop magical coins. Coins of a material far more valuable than gold, or silver. They're coins of love. Or maybe chocolate, but those would melt close to the fire.\n\n\nOnce you've gotten that far, the entirety of the game opens up to you. You'll be able to purchase a fine selection of perfectly burnable items from one of the many catalogs. Each one brings with it its own unique properties. If you burn batteries, they explode. If you burn wood or paper, it burns very bright and quick. And if you burn living things, why they let out the most delightful scream. But it's not until you've started combining things that the action really starts to heat up. Ba-dum-tss.\n\n\nLittle Inferno is a special game in that it's not one with concrete goals. There are no missions to complete, or collectibles to find. It's a simple game with a simple goal. Burning things. It's not quite a puzzle game, or a physics game, or a sandbox game. But it definitely features elements of all three.\n\n\nTrivial "combo" challenges work as one of the little things to keep you busy, tasking you with solving little pun riddles by burning specific items together. For example, the "Springtime" combo requiring you to set fire to a pack of flower seeds and an alarm clock. Which explodes into a fun little mess of flowers and mechanical bits. Aside from that, the only real "goals" to the game are burning every object at least once.\n\n\nBut Little Inferno isn't one of those kinds of games. Little Inferno is about more that that. It's about bigger things. Simply burning everything, yeah, that's pretty fun. But the game's surprisingly strong story leaves the biggest impact. And it's done in such a subtle way. In addition to the many flammable objects that you'll be getting in your little mailbox, you'll get occasional letters from your neighbor and other characters. While at first innocent, charming, and mildly creepy, they'll slowly start to clue you in to a much bigger, much more chilling goings-on happening away from your fireplace.\n\n\nIt's not a very long game. Unless you attempt to solve every challenge, you should be done with it in hours. It's a lot like like lighting your house on fire. It goes out super fast unless you pour gasoline on it. Trust me. You wouldn't even need to call any firefighters or anything. If you're looking for the kind of game that you can sink tons of time into doing things that might seem "productive", this game is not it. But the developers clearly put a lot of love into every little object. Each one is unique in quite a few ways. Some of them have multiple pieces, or react to fire in fun ways. And some have properties that can interact with other objects. You can light a cat on fire and have it explode, filling your entire fireplace with cat poop. And then drop a nuke inside. What kind of sick person would NOT jump at the opportunity to nuke a fireplace full of cat poop?\n\n\nOnce you've burned through the game, Little Inferno's haunting and chilling feel will live on in your mind for quite a while. Everything from the zany pyromaniac action to the beautiful use of sound and music, and quirky art direction will leave an impression on you. It's definitely the kind of game that sticks with you for a while after. Burning inside you. Ba-dum-tss.\n\n\nIt's the most fun you can have that isn't lighting actual things on fire. And once you've finished playing it, you can just burn the game too. Burn your computer, your game systems, your phones, just burn everything. It'll be tons of fun.\n\n\nAlways remember, kids. If you're not the one setting things on fire, you're just the kindling.","January 25","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

Just wow.\n\nI originally picked this game up at the recommendation of my mum. She told me to try it because I could burn ♥♥♥♥. And sure enough, there is a lot of burning.\n\nIn fact, that’s pretty much all you do. You burn things to earn coins, with which you buy more things to burn to earn more coins. All of which is done in this cute little fireplace you own. Which is apparently marketed toward children. That explains the stunning lack of adult reasoning. Nope. No reasoning here. We burnt it along with everything else.\n\nOf course, there is a little more to it than that. You have to wait for the things you buy to deliver, or use stamps to make them deliver immediately. You earn stamps randomly, or by burning the right things together. And if you royally ♥♥♥♥ it all up, and you find yourself with no coins and no things to burn, then hang out for a bit. Some bugs will make your fireplace their home, and you can burn them too! And guess what? You get more coins!\n\nAt some point you make friends with the person living on the other side of your fireplace. They've got a fireplace too. And they ask you to send them stuff to burn. Because why burn it yourself when you have someone else to do it for you?\n\nThere is a rather cute ending to the game. Which oddly enough, did not involve burning stuff. At some point you actually DO stop burning stuff. But I won’t tell you when. In fact, I can’t. I burnt the spoiler. Whoops!\n\nIn all honesty, this game feels like it was originally developed for mobile devices and ported to the PC later. There are no keyboard controls. Click and drag with the mouse.\n\nThe graphics aren’t bad. The game does lag when you blow things up enough, but I believe that was actually intentional. Add more drama to the explosion, or something like that.\n\nAnyway, I do recommend this game. Even at the $9.99 price tag. It did provide me with a few hours of good entertainment. Most of which were spent waiting for more things to burn, rather than actually burning things.\n\nI will leave you with some sound advice. You get a ticket for a free hug at some point. BURN IT.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/recommended/221260/","futome","Claire✿","http://steamcommunity.com/id/futome/","322 products in account","A good game that's about watching high-definition pixels burning all the things while being very amusing and relaxing.\n\n\nLittle Inferno is a causal, relaxing game with a underlying message behind the gameplay and the story that's told through mail you get periodically every now and again when you buy the next tier of items to set ablaze in your Little Inferno Playset.\n\nBefore I explain the gameplay, I want to explain some of the foundations of this game this way it feels less awkward in the transistion to the mechanics and how this game is played.\n\nSo to start. Little Inferno takes place in a time where the world is on apocolyptic-conditions due to the fact that the weather outside is in artic-conditions. Little Coporporation invented "The Little Inferno" to stall the arctic advances with creating a temporary source of heat emitted from the Little Inferno playsets (there's many theories and spoilers surrounding this subject, so i'll avoid that.). You have been given one of these playsets in-regards to your entertainment of setting a vast assortment of items on fire.\n\nOkay, in this game there's three main characters as you progress. The Weatherman who gives you up-to-date messages about the world and weather, Bubbles, who is your neighbor and also possess a Little Inferno Playset. And then there's the CEO of Little Inferno Corporation who sends you letters from time to time.\n\nTo progress the story, you have to buy items to burn and then harvest the coins that drop from said burned items to purchase a more-expensive item. You continue doing this until you reach the end of a catalouge. Then you'll be given the option to buy the next catalouge, which has a fee requirement and a combo requirement.\n\nCombos, are essentially puzzles. You get a list of these said "combos" with a combo title and a clue to how many items are needed to achieve it.  To do this, you must figure out what items are involved in the combo and then you must buy them and then burn them altogther sharing the same flame. If the combo is correct, it will be checked off on your list and you'll be given stamps.\n\nStamps, are used to fast-forward the time you have to wait for shipments to come to your home in the game. The longer amount of time it takes to get there, the more stamps it will cost. Essentially you can wait the time down to be something you'd be more comfortable spending. So say an item costs 7 stamps to instantly send it to your inventory, you can wait a minute or two and then have it sent directly to your house at the price of 3 stamps.\n\nStamps are just used for when you're feeling a little impatient and want to speed things up. They are dropped randomly from a burned item from time to time.\n\nThe game has good pacing as buying a new catalouge eats up a hearty wad of your cash. More or less forcing you to start from one or two catalouges in the past and work your way back up again. But it also gives you opportunity to figure out other combos as some combos cannot be completed until a new catalouge and item is unlocked.\n\n\nThe special effects and sound effects in this game are quite good. There's high-definition effects mixed in with their art style and they work well with each other. Also this games good sense of dark humor is quite pleasing.\n\nI found it hard to find any issues with this game as any issues I have with it stems with the fact that I may have not been playing it relaxingly and casually. This game functions very well and it's items mechanics are quite good, no bugs, glitches or anything. Everything functions smoother than a hot blade through butter. It was a very good experience.\n\nThe story behind the gameplay was very solid, and the games mechanics are simple but they're perfect and well-designed for a relaxing casual game like this.\n\nSo, all in all. The sound effects are good and they make the proper sounds for all interactions I feel. The balance between the art-style and the graphics they used is well-done. The humor's good, the story's good. I can't complain about this game. At all. They know what they envisioned, and they made it and really made a perfectly functioning game and I commend them for that. Nothing seemed out of placed or a nail jagged out of the floorboards if you catch my drift.\n\nI have replayed Little Inferno 3 times, I am unsure of how many times people would replay this game. So I can't give a reasonable estimate for that other than you'll surely beat it once.\n\n\nI bought this game on sale, but it is most definitely worth the full price.\n\n\nThank you for reading my review, I hope it has aided you in your consideration if you want to buy this product or not.\n\nJust know that even if you beat this game once and you wouldn't want to beat it again. ...you'll definitely return to just watch things burn in all their high-resoluted burning glory.\n\nAgain, thanks for reading. Have a good one.","September 28, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","359 products in account","Personal Rating: 8/10\n\nThis game. It's great! The story is simplistic, yet very effective, making you care for the characters in the game. If you want a burning simulator, this is for you. If you want a depressing story about the Tomorrow Corporation Owner leaving everyone for dead, this is for you. The art style, beautiful. The animations on each burning object, neat. The amount of time and thought that went into this game is superb.\n\nNow from that above statement you're probably thinking. "But Doc! Why isn't it 10/10?"\n\nWell, that's a very easy question. It reminds me of The Simpsons Tapped Out. Constantly waiting for another object, to move on to the next part of the story, that is spoon fed to you every ten minutes or so. Another thing is replay value. None that I can find myself doing, it's a one playthrough game, however fun it is. I must admit there are side "quests" that have been added, like finding all the recipies and the secret ending (which I wont be spoiling).\n\nIn closure, it's a lovely game and it's worth the money to support the developers future depressing inferno games.","April 24, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

At first it just seems like a game where you burn stuff and have crazy 'toys', however it's much deeper than the surface shows. With a really good story and mysterious. yet, eerie atmosphere with more and more creepy things happening as the story moves along. Honestly that's all that can be said, the game needs and deserves to be experienced in full. The combos are brilliant and some of them are really clever.

Sarcastic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/docsarcastic/","359 products in account","Personal Rating: 8/10\n\nThis game. It's great! The story is simplistic, yet very effective, making you care for the characters in the game. If you want a burning simulator, this is for you. If you want a depressing story about the Tomorrow Corporation Owner leaving everyone for dead, this is for you. The art style, beautiful. The animations on each burning object, neat. The amount of time and thought that went into this game is superb.\n\nNow from that above statement you're probably thinking. "But Doc! Why isn't it 10/10?"\n\nWell, that's a very easy question. It reminds me of The Simpsons Tapped Out. Constantly waiting for another object, to move on to the next part of the story, that is spoon fed to you every ten minutes or so. Another thing is replay value. None that I can find myself doing, it's a one playthrough game, however fun it is. I must admit there are side "quests" that have been added, like finding all the recipies and the secret ending (which I wont be spoiling).\n\nIn closure, it's a lovely game and it's worth the money to support the developers future depressing inferno games.","April 24, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/omyyer/recommended/221260/","omyyer","Dat Boiler","http://steamcommunity.com/id/omyyer/","246 products in account","How on earth can a creative little toy such as Little Inferno be so linear? While "playing" this game you feel like you are just burning things to unlock the rest of the things so that you can throw away this monstrosity, because Little Inferno is awful. It could have actually done rather well if the unlocking system was sorted out, but since there are so many restrictions on what you can burn and when you can burn them, it’s a losing battle trying to have fun with the toy.\n\nYou start the game with a catalogue and only the first few objects are available for purchase. You get coins from burnt objects and every object coughs up more money than it was bought for. After you burn these items to a crisp, you go back to the catalogue and buy the next few items. Another problem the game has is that the objects that you buy from the catalogue don’t appear on your shelf immediately. Instead you have to wait for the objects to ship to your house, like freakin’ Amazon. If you really can’t wait, you can use a stamp (which is basically a rarer version of a coin) to knock 30 seconds off the delivery time. That’s right you can get a faster delivery. Like freakin’ Amazon. What makes matters worse is that there are seven catalogues and each one has items with longer and longer wait times for delivery until the last item which takes an outrageous five minutes to arrive.\n\nThe only actual gameplay involved is making combos, which is where you are given a clue, then have to work out which two objects to burn together to complete the challenge. The only problem is, the clues are unbelievably obvious, for example “Bike-Pirate” is the clue for the combo involving the bicycle and the pirate. What fun.\n\nThe developers even added a storyline in the form of very burnable letters from people you never actually meet. Almost every single one has the phrase “This can’t last forever” in some shape or form, and this could be like a side-plot except I don’t care in the slightest.\n\nI was put in mind of FarmVille and all those other Facebook games that spanned out their gameplay by having users spending most of the time waiting. I can only assume that these games were the developers’ only points of reference when designing. I know I’m probably being a little harsh since it’s only an indie game made by a tiny team of people, but if we can produce something as illuminating as Bastion, there is no need for Little Inferno hiding in a mass of smoke, getting in people’s eyes and making them water.","January 19, 2014","false","1.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","2"

One could argue that there are two stories being told: the story of the main character, told via traditional means, and the story of the player, told by the timers on the boxes as they're being stared at by pairs of eyes round the world, eager to discover the next nothing. Finally, there's no closure given, instead the player returns to the start screen, able to pick up from where they left.\n\nCharacter 5/10:\nMs. Plumps is a classic example of a hamartanousa heroine, who, after being punished, distances herself from the tragic hero, who keeps committing the same crime till the ultimate hubris that will set him free, as it did her. However, none of the characters seems to have any more depth than their cardboard representations: Plumps is the ditz the PC should strive to follow, PC is a blank slate, Weather Man is stuck in his balloon, and Nancy is just someone with a plan that came to fruition regardless of any actions or omission by any other character.\n\nThought 2/10:\nOnly there as background noise, seeing as all the characters are single-minded pyromaniacs.\n\nDiction 5/10:\nIt's what could have saved this game alone, if it was given a little more love. The message is simple, yet powerful. Any gamer has probably felt it (more so any critic/reviewer), however a simple mention of a deep thought is not the same as exploration of the same. In the end it felt like a cheap cop-out.\n\nMelody 6/10:\nThe music has the decency to not overburden us with its presence.\n\nSpectacle 7/10:\nIt manages to be pretty throughout; be it through sleek flammable objects, or haunting character design later on.\n\nFinal verdict:\nRecommended only if you are willing to suffer mild boredom so that you can appreciate its half-baked message.","January 19, 2014","false","4.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

That's it. And for some reason burning stuff gives you money- more than you have to give out for buying them items. So... well... boring you think? No!\nThere are 100 Combos you can breake, some are more hard, some less, and having enough combos you unlock new items. So you always have a motivation for finding out the combos. But anyways...it becomes repetetive after some time and so the game left some points back at gameplay.\nBut it is pretty nice for Replayability: Sometimes I just think: "Hmm, how about buring some stuff and have a nice fire" and open it. Just for the heck of it. I burn, because I burn. As the human is, because he is. There is no really deeper sense- wait! THERE IS!\nThis video game makes you think about your whole lifestyle... You have these crazy characters...And KEEP THE COUPON UNTIL THE END!... and then this ending- well, I ain't spoiler. But if you become sick of the game just watch it on youtube- it is really worth it.\nSounds and Graphics are neat as every item has his own animation and sound effects and it is just fun to see and hear it. The music is where you need them and characterizing the game, but not nerves you off when you want a nice fire. Everything nice done, Tomorrow Cooperation!\nControls cannot be easier- click to burn. That's it. Just the Longness of the game is not sooo long (ca. 4-5 hours for "plot"), but as it was in a Humble Bundle that is quite enjoyable. I mean- if you want more you get more! So...pretty nice, but not perfect.\n\nTL;DR: I think Little Inferno is a fun game to play, has middle-high points in all categories, be sure to check it out! Just test it and love it...or not...and think about the plot when you are done!","November 25, 2013","true","9.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game consists of the player receiving various catalogues of items that the player must then set fire to. While that in itself might seem redundant, there is actually a stategy to your pyromancy, where you need to figure out different combinations of items to burn to unlock various achievements. The fact that you are kept in front of a tiny fireplace during the game is kept fresh by the letters you receive, giving you small glimpses of the outside world. While the game is quite humorous, as you get closer to the end and the answers to why you are being made to burn these objects, the game starts to take a bit of a darker turn.

To literally describe this game, it sounds like abject ♥♥♥♥♥. You get money, you buy things, you burn things, and by burning things, you get money. Where's the hook? Well, there's a very, very subtle storyline, much of which I feel the player has to decide for themselves. A subtle, dark malaise, which hides in the shadows of the gameplay experience. The above description is accurate, all you're going to do is burn stuff over and over, and even if I tell you that different things burn differently and some explode or give random effects, the real hook of this game is that as you do, you're very slowly given hints as to some tragedy in the background. To me, that's almost more compelling than the pure gameplay itself. But, for those who don't give a ♥♥♥♥, there's plenty to do in finding combos from a list by burning objects together.\n\nIn short, it's cheap, it's quick, it's addictive, and for those who care? It can be a surprisingly deep experience.","July 15, 2013","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You're in for a ride.","February 19, 2015","true","4.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"
