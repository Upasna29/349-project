It offers a lot of challenging single-player campaigns.  You can customize your balloon at your own liking with its own unique powers wth plenty to choose from.\nThe game is a solid addition to your collection and will keep you entertained for a long time.  I only planned to play for a few minutes but i turned into an hour-long quest cause it was so engaging.

Fund it in a bundle, play it for an hour or two, and move on.  You'll get some cards, explode some balloons, and try a few powerups.\n\nI guess some people may be able to make it to the end, and maybe the end is amazing, but I am not one of those people.\n\n7/10 in a bundle or under $1\n1.5/10 at full price, which is very high at $9.99","April 10, 2015","true","1.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

(NO SPOILERS):\n\nHere I am, the one and only Bing, the king and here we are to sing.\n\nLet me recite the killing of my entire race with brisk pace so please brace and tell, how I proved how I removed Seth’s pursuit of me like a conquering chess move. At first it was Arnold, oh how he marvelled at the sight of Thor’s nipple arsenal; he created blueprints and was convinced it would work. The perk was his Dad invented farms that were tested, and prevented the endless crops from blocking Arnold's white socks.\n\nThe mystery is how history lost all evidence of his arrogance, riding on his prevalent excellence, his helplessness was far beyond that of a Bell resident. Arnold knew Bing was a decadent of the great President Jake; he knew he had a chance when Arnold took his tea break.\nHe packed everything from his food racks, sponge cake, Swiss stake and a sea snake. Got in his car, took off the handbrake and raced to the nearest shuttle to take him to a new place. Seth murdered millions in Bing’s opinion, Seth’s dominion and decisions were a result of his position in religion though Bing was just a civilian.\n\nHe was trapped and had lost his map, he couldn't cross the border; he was cornered, Seth moved in like a stalker, ready to slaughter and poured all of his torture in his blade. All Bing had was a pre-made first aid, a handmade used grenade and some water from fair trade.\nThe clock ticked and the time had come. Seth had to desist from, the fight; all his blight and willingness to strike was over that night. Bing had found the light but his planet was nowhere in sight and he could never reunite.\nHe travelled to Earth, 'twas the birth of a new beginning, the Sam’s were singing and the Bells were ringing. Arnold you've had your run, but the story of the last Bing has just begun.","April 10","true","21.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","89","8","9","5","0"

After winning a giveaway for a Desura key, I played and ended up buying it myself because I wanted it on Steam too.  I've completed the campaign and fought in quite a few of the smaller battle modes.  What follows is my Desura review:\n\n\nThe line which divides player access makes Bret Airborne shine. Anything along the outer edge is relatively safe while items neighboring the line are in danger of being stolen. The grace period allows players to shift items around instead of being forced into specific swaps. There is a tug of war as large matches move the line towards the opponent and swapping items with no match moves the line towards oneself. Being aware of items to steal and large matches to perform is encouraged further as skills may count those events as bonus resources.\n\nThe campaign is short, upgrades are offered in small quantities and player's can't grind endlessly for funds. The result is analysis paralysis is reduced and players are encouraged to try again with different options. There are also other modes for session-based play.\n\nThe story is just an excuse for puzzle battles, but that's fine. [When I played on Desura,] I would have appreciated the ability to play in a window, grouped skill messages to avoid (rare) spam from opponents and the ability to immediately jump around a map when enemies are gone. These were all minor annoyances though.  [Since then at least some of these, like playing in a window, have been fixed.] =)","January 29, 2015","true","1.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"

It adds an area limitation - you can only make matches on your side, but matching 4 or more moves the divider over a column for the rest of your turn.  This adds an additional level of complexity (on top of the traditional match-3 combat options like collecting resources and using abilities) which works surprisingly well. The story is laughably unimportant and the graphics are workable but not impressive. But honestly, none of that matters - the gameplay is sound and a lot of fun. If you're a fan of Puzzle Quest or Gems of War, this is a good, distinctive take on the style.  It's relatively short, but there are lots of replay opportunities.","March 11, 2015","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/recommended/342510/","naogilles","Nao 尚","http://steamcommunity.com/id/naogilles/","1700 products in account","Giving a 7/10 for originality (for a match-3 game I mean), 5/10 for presentation, and 4/10 for effort.\n\nI liked the steampunk setting but it's seldom used. I appreciate the thoughts put into the match-3 system, it manages to be fresh.\nI disliked a lot of things, though...\n- Looks like it's all randomized. I started a hard game and found it a bit hard. After a couple of zones, I started an easy game and it was even harder. Wut?! So much for the difficulty curve.\n- It's not that it's particularly hard, but it's tedious. You have to constantly keep an eye on your stats and just make sure they're better than the enemy's. Who's usually very dumb (they don't match obvious matches), their AI never changes, only the techniques they use. A single fight can last for 3 minutes, or 10 to 20 minutes if you're unlucky (no good matches to make, enemy constantly getting repair tools). Things get a bit faster when you get most of the 'good' skills (Firestorm and Timebomb, for instance).\n- The UI is acceptable, but matching animations are very stiff and slow. It's lacking in life. It feels very amateurish. What was acceptable 10 years ago for an indie is no longer the norm. I would recommend using CheatEngine and their SpeedHack to set the speed to 2.0, it makes the animations much less annoying.\n- Also, the matchable items, while they're relatively different from one another (which is important in that kind of game), are still hard to spot because so little thought was put into the gameplay. Just having background colors for items would have made it much better than what we got (full transparency). Just look at the screenshots... Reminds me of Candy Crush Saga. Which isn't exactly a 'great' match-3 game.\n- Something I've seen in many indie games: there's only one battle song, and it's a freaking short song on a loop. It's a nice song (from a royalty-free library I believe, so it wasn't made for the game), but you'll end up turning off the music after a while.\n- Again a staple for indie games: the ending only lasts for a few seconds and is very underwhelming. But I guess it's okay, since there wasn't much story to begin with. Also, final boss? What a poser. He was one of my shortest fights... Maybe I was lucky, I don't know.\n- There are many things that don't serve any purpose. Building towers? Seriously, I never saw any difference with enemies. After the first few zones, I just skipped the towers.\n- You can't go back to a previous area for grinding. You're stuck with the one shop in your current area, and too bad if you missed a good skill in a previous shop because you didn't have the gold for it.\n- The save system is just as bad. Once you win the game, you can't replay the final levels. You have to start again. I'd recommend backing up your save file, if you find it.\n- Many little bugs, especially on the map: navigation spots sometimes have their hit area off by several pixels, requiring some pixel hunting; jumping on a spot with a tower AND an enemy will make you fight the enemy, but you'll have to move back and again if you want to go to the tower; moving to another spot during the enemy animation will not allow you to avoid an enemy, but it will deactivate whatever element you move to (shop, tower).\n- Have only played the single-player campaign. Not interested in multiplayer as of now.\n\nOverall, even though I have more complaints than congratulations to give, I didn't hate the game as much as I thought I would, and that's why I finished it. It takes about 3 hours to see its 'end'. Gets my recommendation solely on the condition that you love match-3 games and don't mind getting into the occasionally excessively long single battle. (You can always hit Esc to quit the game and restart that fight later, perhaps with better luck.)","September 25, 2015","true","7.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"
