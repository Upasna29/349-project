This is when your unable to capture any islands or progress into the game because it simply gets too hard. It has nothing at all to do with skill when groups of turrets are killing your entire army in less than 10 seconds. How to get out of this standstill? Spend a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ing month saving up money and upgrading your boats and soldiers, JUST TO BARLEY WIN THE BATTLE ANYWAY.\n\nEvery single thing in this game requires large amounts of patients, money, and other materials. Most of the time it doesnt make sense anyway.. For example: 5000 wood to upgrade a building, then pretty much double that to upgrade it again? What part of that makes any sense? I know its just a game but honestly why do I need to spend a day saving up wood just for it all to be drained instantly for such a stupid outcome? And what about the enourmous amounts of money it takes to upgrade your army? One of the first upgrades in the game is 10k for like 10 extra damage per second...? I honestly thought this was a glitch or I was reading it wrong.\n\nI dont mind waiting games like these but I do mind having to waste hours to days to weeks to MONTHS for the stupidest outcome. Maybe if there was a way to shorten upgrade time somehow?(Not going to bother wasting money on diamonds) Or maybe keep the amount of materials it takes to upgrade something.

However as I play this game I find flaws that really are more of an overlook then anything but here it goes.. problems with the game include the following :\n\nThe dialouge windows when someone is talking is cut off so you cant read the whole message.. you cant even scroll which is very annoying...\n\nThe second thing I have an issue with is when in battle you cant hover over any of the items like the missles or the medipack and see what it does , it would be nice to know what each thing does, that would be nice... overall though this is a great game just needs some tune up. I do hope that theres more than what I already see because I like it","February 17","true","3.9"," 0 of 10 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","10","0","0"

This is a great concept and very enjoyable as a semi-casual game...enough strategy to not be dull.\n\nI'm listing the negatives here in the hopes that the developers will take them into consideration.  I wouldn't be taking the time to list these if I didn't think this game was promising!\n\n- English translations are horrible\n- Progression is jerky.  At some points, I was leveling up quickly, storming tons of beaches, and having a blast.  At other times, there were no islands I could take and I was left twiddling my thumbs waiting for resources to trickle in.\n- During battles, the mouse is used for two things.  Scrolling the map (via click and drag), and placing markers to guide your troops and bombard targets.  These are currently all done with the left mouse button, which causes unintended actions.  This can easily lead to battles being lost that would have been won.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND that the developers map the left mouse button to actions and the right mouse button to map scrolling!\n\nPolish this up a bit more and this will be a terrific game!

Because I have Boom Beach on my ipod and the screen is tiny, but even so, i have logged many hours on Boom Beach. And i will continue to play it as well.This  is almost identical, and if you paid attention the game is in its early stages, and they want your input to make it better!! and also dont foget its free!!! i have paid lots of money for games that end up being a Rip-off. If you dont like it uninstall it. But your missing the point here, it is meant for you to be able to play it on your P.

For the most part connection to the server is good and loading is quick enough.\n\nThe downside to the game is that because the developers are not native english speakers the translation is not great.
