The puzzles are fairly easy, there is a strategy guide.

Not without its charms.  A big step up from PlayRIX's other bug-riddled game, Fall of the New Age.  This one plays like a lesser Artifex Mundi game,without hidden object scenes (there might be one or two).  Simplistic adventure point and click scenarios.  Fun & entertaining for its short length, as long as you're not looking for anything too challenging.","January 15, 2015","true","7.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

Fun, fast paced, LOGICAL, unique puzzles, lots of unusual maze types, well written storyline, and though it is not technically a Hidden Object game (no HO scenes) it plays like one.  It has a find and use inventory and is classified as a Hidden Object game by most game companies.  I really recommend this game.  Plus it is steampunk.  How can anyone go wrong with that?  (Circa 2013)\n\nStoryline: When the Princess of Namariel was one year old the Kingdom was invaded by the Iron Lord.  Her mother while fleeing with her infant daughter gets tripped by the nasty mechnical centipede and the baby flies out the tower window.  The infant instead of falling to her death she is snatched out of the air by a fleeing citizen in his balloon airship.  Fast forward 17 years, and the Iron Lord was found out where the fleeing citizen, the great inventor Davincino (and yes, that sounds just like DaVinci) has been hiding.  Of course the Iron Lord sends his mechanized minions to capture Davincino and our young former princess sets out to rescue her Uncle Davincino.  Several plot twists later, she discovers she is the Princess of Namariel, just exactly who the Iron Lord is, and becomes the savior of her Kingdom.\n\nGameplay:  As I have said before this plays just like an Hidden Object game with a find and use inventory, and most game companies classify it as a Hidden Object game.  The only thing missing are actual Hidden Object scenes.  The gameplay is very logical and is very fast paced.  The game does make one tongue in cheek comment about not having a screwdiver so something else must be used.  Truly a recognition of HO gamers complaints that if one has a hammer why, oh why can one not just break the window with it instead of having to use convoluted means to open it.  Best example of the games mind set on this subject is when needing a three pronged lever, one gets to use a three pronged fork.    (Thumbs Up)\n\nThere is no map, it is not really needed.  The play scope is generally limited to only three or four areas at a time.  Since the game logically progresses in a linear fashion, once an area is complete the player can not go back.  There are 8 chapters in the main game and a bonus chapter which is an after mass epilogue.\n\nPuzzles: For me, I had great time with these puzzles, many I consider to be classics.  Some of these puzzle types (brain teasers, dots, logic) I have not seen in years and are not found in newer games.  This game also uses all types of mazes.  The aquarium is three phase maze puzzle, though not hard, certainly makes one think.\n\nOverall nothing in this game is difficult to figure out but it does take a bit of thinking to solve the problem or puzzle presented.  The in-game achievements are nothing like to ones found in newer games.  There are filled-in characters instead of their silhouette making a scene.  There is a built in strategy guide, and two game modes, casual and expert.  Extras include wallpapers, videos (cut scenes), concept art, music, etc.   One last thing the player gets two helpers: a squirrel cat that loves acorns and a flying round robot named Jim. : )\n\nHighly recommend the game.  It plays in about 6-7 hours depending on how fast the gamer plays.\nOne last comment the Steam price is less expensive then other game sites.","April 16","true","7.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

It has a good story, nice visuals, and a decent amount of casual difficulty puzzles.\n\nLong version:Namariel Legends: Iron Lord looks like a hidden object game, feels like a hidden object game, and plays like a hidden object game. The user interface, the point ‘n’ click elements, the casual puzzles, and the gorgeous hand-drawn graphics all point to a modern hidden object title, except for one thing: it doesn’t have hidden object scenes. Not a single one.\n\nThe story is as simple as it can get: an evil overlord takes over the fairy tale/steampunk kingdom, and to save said kingdom and its royal couple, you must destroy the overlord’s power source.\nStrangely though, it works. Despite the simple setup, it is an exciting and fast-paced adventure from almost start to finish.\nThe level design is another strong point. It never hinders you, but gives a fair challenge.\n\nIf you expected a hidden object title, you may be disappointed, but otherwise Namariel Legends is a fun game for anyone.","June 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","0"

At the highest difficulty there aren't HO scenes but only minigames and puzzles, so it isn't technically a Hidden Object Game, but an Adventure game. The Premium Edition has also a bonus playable chapter and nice extras, there are achievements but only in-game. Absolutely recommended.","May 3, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlvoriaGPM/recommended/302730/","AlvoriaGPM","AlvoriaGPM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AlvoriaGPM/","15 products in account","Beautiful art, but really a one-note game.\n\nNamariel Legends is a beautiful game artisticly... at least for the most part. The gorgeous hand-painted backgrounds and items are a delight to look at. The CG bits are clumsily done in every way, but they can be forgiven for just how beautiful all of the rest of the art in the game looks. Adventure game designers take note: THIS is a game to emulate in the graphics department.\n\nUnfortunately there's no real story to this game. Really there are only a half dozen 'story' events and none of them really build character or make the world feel alive. The rest of your time is spent on the most tired of Point-and-click adventure game tropes: Rubbing things on other things. Because the art is so beautiful, this often turns into a pixel hunt for items since nothing stands out visually. It's all beautiful... but that also kinda works against it. Yea, there are a few other puzzles but most of them aren't that interesting and serve to bog down the game rather than move it forward.\n\nThat's not to say this is all bad. With one or two exceptions, the puzzles are at least logical. Or... rather... they pretty much tell you what to do by reading the text at the top of the screen. The fact that there's a help button and strategy guide built into the game also prevents you from getting stuck. Likewise all of the really difficult puzzles can just be skipped outright, which I had to do on only two occasions. Because these 'cheat' features keep the game moving forward it can serve a an OK introduction to the genre for those who have never experienced a point-and-click adventure game.\n\nI should also make note about the game's soundtrack. Great music... but often poorly used. There are a few tracks that create a very tense atmosphere including one right at the beginning of the game when the high stakes and hair raising action involve... finding oil for an artificial leg. Yea... not exactly the best time for the "hurry up or people will die" track.\n\nSpeaking of, the game also tries its best to make for a couple of tense moments... but because it's a point-and-click adventure there's no real possibility that you're in danger. Once you realize this, all of the 'danger' seems really artificial and almost off-putting. Why lock off half of a screen when realistically the 'dangerous' thing can't hurt you? Gameplay/narative segregation at its finest.\n\nFinally there's the lack of followthrough for one of the mechanics I thought would be most interesting: The mind-reading device you get at the beginning of the game. Yea, for being made such a big deal of you really only need to use it three or four times... and even then could probably get on without it for most of the puzzles. It's like they forgot about it half way through development or added it in last-minute. A real shame.\n\nI feel bad giving this a thumbs down. It's obvious that the artists worked their fingers off creating an amazing looking game. It's really just a shame that the game's designers didn't put the same level of skill into their part of the craft. :(","December 7, 2015","false","5.2"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

It's a casual, point and click adventure game that's got good graphics, pretty good voice acting (better than you'd get in an Artifex Mundi game) and a reasonable story.  I played under Linux without trouble and completed the base game in 5 hours.  Add another 0.8 hours for the bonus chapter and it's a good, fun game.  The puzzles are a bit easy.

The story got a little odd at the end, but it was alright- the voice acting was also alright for the most part- all-in-all I'd definately say worth $7.","June 1","true","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
