The fights were challenging, much tougher than I expected, and the storyline was neat with lots of great homages to Lovecraft's works.\nYour main character is a detective, that should give you a (ha) clue of what to expect; examine everything. The difficulty of finding everything may put some off, but if you're stuck, it's probably because you haven't examined everything or haven't from the right side. Pay attention, there are little details that may be easy to miss; it doesn't just hand you the answers.","May 8, 2015","true","25.7"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","0"

The story is heavily H.P. Lovecraft inspired. You follow the three people of the Pendleton Agency; Monroe, Webley and Pendelton, in their attempt to understand a murder which ultimately takes them to odd places and fights with insects and cultists. The graphics is partly, just awful. Characters move like mannequins (their knees don't bend) and it's the same with enemies of different species. The characters you control, move in a very stiff manner and the ones you don't move walk around like mental patients going through cars and tables etc. The combat is turnbased and doesn't hold your hand one bit, it's hard fight, with little to no way to heal your characters early on, so make sure you save often, because you will need to reload fights. Another thing that might annoy you, depending on your screen resolution is that there are no settings in the game, none. You can open a website pdf as a manual, so you at least can get fullscreen, meaning for me, a slightly bigger screen with a black list around it (I have 1920x1080) and there nothing you can do about it.\n\nEven with a story I would have liked to finish, I can't put myself through the rest of this just for the story. It really feels like 95% of the effort was put on the story, and the rest thrown together so you can play it. If you like difficult games, with a good story and nothing more, wait until a steep sale. The rest should stay away. 3.6/10","March 13","false","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's still challenging, and harder than average, but the almost-unwinnable situation I described from the opening combat sequence of the game has thankfully not been repeated yet.  Doesn't mean I haven't had to retry fights, but they were merely hard and not unfair.  So if that's something that's keeping you on the fence, I wanted to pop in and add this update to what I'd originally written.\n\nAs an avid fan of Lovecraft and Lovecraft-inspired games, I was immediately attracted to the idea of an old-school RPG set in a Lovecraftian environment.  We've had adventure games, "shooters" (or at least, first-person games) and strategy games based on the works of the gentleman from Providence, but no straight-up RPGs that I can recall.  The Dark Stone from Mebara therefore seemed to fill some void in the gaming world.\n\nI've not played a great deal of it yet, but here are my impressions so far:\n\nGraphics:\n\nYes, they are 2D.  But they are really rather good for 2D - certainly, the games looks better at fullscreen than, say, Gemini Rue.  The graphics most resembled Arcanum's, to my eye, and although 3D graphics have evolved to the point where we now have good levels of detail, there will always be something artistic and interesting about 2D graphics done well.  Not a 5 because there are some oddities - a secretary standing inside of her chair instead of being seated, etc.\n\nSound:\n\nI like the music quite a bit.  Sounds good, very atmospheric and does a good job setting the mood.  It is perhaps not particularly original in concept, but well-executed all the same.\n\nStory/Writing:\n\nHaven't gotten that far yet, but the story so far seems a bit different from other HPL-inspired games, so points for originality and for tapping into the "unknown from beyond" theme of Lovecraft's that was so central to his work, instead of simply focusing on the horrible monsters (though those are in plentiful supply as well).  The dialogue and descriptive text is functional but well-written.\n\nGameplay:\n\nI died 5 times in the first fight before finally winning on a lucky critical hit.  Going to hope that the recent changes to difficulty plus gaining some levels will help here.  The first monster one-hit killed anyone that wasn't guarding, and confusion would usually cause one of my own party to kill the other remaining member.  Probably the first monster should either hit less hard, or not use confusion.  Smelling salts didn't seem to work when I used them.  On the positive side, movement is easy, interface is simple, and I'm used to the old-school notion of interacting with everything to see if anything is there.\n\nOverall:\n\nI would recommend this to those with a fondness for Lovecraft or for old-school RPGs.  Very little in the way of hand-holding, so if you've only experienced games that highlight all your interactable objects and tell you everywhere to go, you're going to need to put your big boy/girl pants on for this one.  The only area with which I have any qualms is the difficulty, and it's possible those concerns will be alleviated as I move onward in the game.  As far as 2D, old-school games go, as well as in filling the need for Lovecraftian RPGs, I'm definitely encouraged by the Dark Stone from Mebara.","July 25, 2015","true","6.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"
