In fact, its story is quite predictable. If you can put aside that the mystery isn't REALLY a mystery and more of a puzzle, then you will enjoy this game.\n\nIf you, like me, love watching arbitrary sliders go up for acting like a Lannister, you will enjoy this game. If you had a good, or at least not-awful time in High School, chances are you will enjoy this game.\n\nIt's not amazing, it doesn't have tons of depth. But it does have a lot of replayability, and the story it tells is interesting no matter what angle you come at it with, even if you want your Player Character to be a delinquent to a Model Citizen.\n\nJust don't click fast. The one bug is that clicking fast will cause text to not show up, or skip a scene entirely.\n\nHonestly, sell some trading cards and pick it up for change.

Save the cheerleader, save the world? Well, this game is nothing like Heroes, but for sure its something unique that you will probably enjoy playing/reading. Its an interactive story, like Telltale's Walking Dead game, but with nothing but the texts. Dont think that this game is cheesy or superfluous just becouse of the high school theme, the story can be simple and easy to understand, but will you face tons of hard choices to make, and you can take various different paths through the game. It kinda reminds me of my teenage high school times, and you will probably relate the game to your memories. I highly reccomend addint this title to your collection, its very cheap and it will be worth your time.","December 29, 2014","true","4.8"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","29","36","0","0"

Sad, because I liked a few other stories from Choice of Games and would usually want to replay them. But not this one.\n\nFirst off, the characters' personalities barely had depth. No one was complex, which pretty much guaranteed my lack of attachments towards the characters. I didn't feel anything when making choices or reading because I couldn't relate to any of them. They were stereotypical to a fault.\n\nThere were also a few inconsistencies in the story. For example I was holding a job, yet the father of the protagonist said that he was the only one making money if the mom lost her job... and then the game suggested that I had too many things to do, so I had to drop something. I ended up dropping the job since it didn't seem like it had any real significance to the story. The cash I made didn't have any bearing to the game at all. What was the point of getting a job if it was barely acknowledged?\n\n(spoiler) It also all just seemed so convenient to take down the villains, like how the protagonist just *happened* to find confidential tax information by doing some internet research, of all ways. Thing is, taxes aren't public unless the protagonist was some kind of elite hacker, but the game didn't make any mention of that. Also, students would not be normally suspicious about a teacher's salary and a nice house unless they had real reason to care or had it out for them. As for the villains, they barely had any chemistry at all. Their partnership was barely just a thread. People who commit tax fraud and brainwash people together would have a more familiar relationship, no?\n\nAnyway this story has potential, but my impression is that it gave the bare minimum and it's still not complete. Even the endings could've been a bit more expanded upon to at least instill some satisfaction on the choices I've made, but it didn't.","December 28, 2015","false","1.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

Very lazy and formulaic writing. While the author is mechanically literate and capable of basic plot planning, it reads like a condescending impassionate account of a middle aged person who is struggling with both remembering what those wacky tasteless dumb teenagers are supposed to be like and not falling asleep from the lack of any genuine interest in the subject matter. Needless to say, anything anyone might consider exciting about being a teenager is presented clinically at best. Often it's, again, condescending to a degree that is irksome even to someone who isn't a teenager anymore simply by the virtue of empathy. Which just makes you wonder who exactly was supposed to be the target audience of this work. Who is supposed to enjoy this oversimplified mockery of teenage life and why? I can only imagine perhaps pre-teens actually getting excited over this glimpse simply due to the fact that they're the only ones who might not know better and not realize just how hilariously fake it is.\n\nThere is very little to enjoy in this from any perspective. Every plot element is sterile, predictable and pragmatic. The way it's delivered it could as well have been about financial bookkeeping rather than magic, friendship or romance. There is no feeling to anything. There is absolutely no subtlety. Certain events and scenes are absurdly blunt and cheesy, serving as the only real source of amusement together with some silly action choices here and there. There is even a blatantly obvious self-insert character. I honestly don't know how much mindnumbing is necessary to be able to take any of this seriously. I certainly couldn't.\n\n... And then I got an ending where my character ended up being a permanently confused mentally impaired couch potato incapable of coherent thought or perception. Which has left me with very strange feelings. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm all for depressing endings that punish me for acting unwisely, which I absolutely have, but if you try to match this to the rest of the game which is absolutely impossible to take seriously... it just doesn't work. You can't just make me respect your story in one swift vindictive move. I mean, this ending is actually the most, or rather the only daring unexpected plot device in the whole story and how dark and depressing it is only makes it even more absurd and hilarious. It doesn't help that it's possibly a punishment only for my very last action and it's hard to say with certainity if that's the case. It's really hard to describe just how out of place and how big of a mismatch in tone this feels, but I certainly found it noteworthy so there you go anyway.\n\n\nSo yeah. This simply won't do. I can't recommend this to anyone for any reason. Especially not to fans of Veronica Mars, from which this work... tries to... take inspiration... sort of. Unless you want to see what a fanfiction of a cool drama series would look like if it was in the accounting book genre.","March 6, 2015","false","3.6"," 32 of 50 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","32","50","3","1"

The first type of game I've played in this genre and I have to say it was underwhelming. It was really obvious what my choices would lead to and there weren't too many meaningful choices. I understand with the high school setting the most popular subjects to experience are popularity, romance, and friendships, but this game doesn't do well with any of these.\nIts a story game man with nothing but text. Theres not even a soundtrack. So what the game does present must be top notch. Romance is very linear and predictable because if you generally pick the "flirty" option then you're gonna get the girl; but if you pick the "awkward" option, you won't and it's pretty obvious which is which. Same problem with the friendships; very linear and most of the time fairly predictable. Also, at the start of the game, its very easy to gain altuistic points because you're helping people with stuff that you didn't even choose to do. The game just throws you into the world which is kind of cool, but there was no real background information. Like I have super powers man! Explain that ♥♥♥♥ for more than a few paragraphs!\nThe characters are hardly memorable because they're the sterotype people you meet in high school; the childhood friend, the bad kid, the mean kid, the cheer captain, the football captain, the popular mean girl, ect. No one has a really unique story and its a shame because there was potential for them to be really fleshed out.\nOverall, this game is a good read if you're just bored as hell and have nothing else to play. Nostalgic because its high school but unimmersive because some of the dialouge is just weird and kids would never say that ♥♥♥♥. Fun because you can date multiple girls at once (which was the primary reason i played this game), but ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because those girls don't ever seem to have interaction between each other.\nFinal score: 5.5/10","September 9, 2015","false","3.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

In terms of a text adventure, it doesn't compare being that progression through the story is more linear than an open world of TAs of old. BUT, the writing draws you in, the characters are believable and interactions are fun. I found myself wanting to boot up another game or two just to see what happens if I had chosen my path differently. Which by the looks of it, and knowing how these sort of "games" work; there seems to be a good amount of variability in story if you make different choices. I failed my first attempt, in the sense that I didn't get a perfectly happy ending. But because it was just a whole lot of fun reading the story and playing the game, I'm plesantly surprised to say this game gets my stamp of approval.\n\n8/10","January 4, 2015","true","21.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

I liked most of them, but I feel the need to downvote this one, especially as it received so much positive votes, I think I need to tell some negative things about this novel.\n\nFirst, the choices are way too obvious and non story-driven. I mean by "obvious" that, most of times, you know clearly what will be the consequences when you make a choice. And the worst is that these choices seem only there to provide a justification for the skills & stats: the choices basically are always "I'd like to solve this issue by using Magic, and improve my Magic stat" or "I'd use my Academics stat to pass this skill check". The consequence of these is that I never felt immersed in the story, strangely it gave the feeling that I was "grinding" my stats like in a MMORPG... And that's not what I want for a interactive novel.\n\nAnd on the story itself, I found it too simplistic. Maybe I placed my hopes too high for a "high school teenager drama", but comparing to other novels of Choice of Games, the story of Psy High is really poor: full of stereotypes, some side stories are not developed enough. And I never felt any moment of tension buildup or thrilling, the story is just shallow, and everything seemed so easy...\n\nConclusion:\n\n2/5, it's like Twilight... some may like it, but I definitively think there are better games/novels in the genre. If you like interactive novels in the them of "supernatural powers", the Hero Project series is way better choice. And if you search for a good CYOA novel, Choice of Robots is waaaaaaaaaaay better than this.","March 14, 2015","false","5.9"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","0"

Good, and worth full price, though not _great_.  I found it an enjoyable way to pass an hour and a half, and may replay it in future.\n\nFor those who haven't played a Choice Of game before, it's basically the natural evolution of Choose your Own Adventure Books, a few decades on.  They're MUCH more refined than the CYOA books of the 80s, though.  They're Wolfenstein: the New Order to the original Wolfenstein 3D.\n\nYou're given a short novel in which most important decisions are up to you, the reader.  Whether the plot twist you decide on succeeds depends on the choices you've made so far - staying in character is rewarded, while out of character actions are less likely to work.\n\nThe character in question is the sum of your past choices.  If at every turning point in the story so far, you've chosen to act like a selfish loner, don't expect to be able to successfully give an inspirational speech to rally others to your side.  I've you've chosen sports over academics whenever you've been able to, you'll almost certainly succeed at physical challenges (or those involving swaying the sports team or its fans) while not necessarily having a good chance of passing that crucial history test.\n\nThe story of Psy High is exactly as described.  If it were a live-action TV show, it wouldn't be (much) out of place on a DIsney afternoon line-up, or playing just before Charmed or Supernatural.\n\nThe writing is good enough to have often made me forget I was playing a game without graphics.  The characters are your usual high school stereotypes, but handled competently.  Choices have a satisfying level of consequence, but the game seldom presents you with unfixable mistakes.\n\nIn my playthrough, there were some strange jumps in the story near the end.  I can't tell if this was a deliberate editing choice, or if a few 'pages' were missing in error.  Though the jumps were a little jarring, I was still able to follow the story.  (Imagine an episode of 24 not accounting for fifteen minutes of the 24 hours, near the end.)\n\nThere were two pretty noticeable weaknesses to the story - first, the central plot was completely predictable from just a few minutes in.  A mystery to the reader, it certainly wasn't.\n\nSecond, although I think I chose the 'main' romance (kudos to Choice of Games for providing tons of tasteful choices for all preferences, as usual) it still felt pretty tacked on - almost as if most of the scenes and details had been added after the rest of the game was written.\n\nWorth full price, but best for younger players (12-16).","January 2, 2015","true","1.5"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

There's no grammar or spelling errors, and choices lead to logical conclusions. Unfortunately, the writing's pretty average: all of the characters are likeable or dislikeable as required, but do nothing to break out of the "high school drama" cast stereotypes. You've got your sweet girl/boy-next-door childhood friend, your bad boy/girl rebel, your perfect and gorgeous (with little else beyond that) crush, your fashionable queen-bee rich ♥♥♥♥♥ - the list goes on, and none of them are anything you haven't seen before. The psychic aspect is mildly interesting, but again, reminiscent of Sky High and other "teens with superpowers" works.\n\nIt's unoffensive and the price tag is cheap, so you could do worse when it comes to choose-your-own-adventure games.

Lots of games and literature borrow ideas from pre-existing stories, but it becomes a problem when nothing new is added to the borrowed material.\nA teenaged investigator? Veronica Mars, anyone? A bunch of teenagers with magical abilities? Okay, there's lots of things you could take that from, but I got a Secret Circle vibe from this.

But this is the lamest CYOA I've ever bought from Steam. This game is full of generic, forgettable characters and the writing is very dull. The writer somehow manages to take something cool and exciting and make it UNexciting and dull. Maybe making fun things suck is her superpower? In addition to that, in this story you go to school in what is practically San Francisco with Gay Pride Week and all. The writer specifies that you are happy to be there - as is everyone else in the story - and that if this or that happened, such as two boys going to the prom with each other, neither you nor anyone else would even blink because you and everyne else in this story supports that. I'm not being insulting to any LGBT people but come on. People are individuals and when a writer stupidly introduces an extremely divisive subject like homosexuality (or abortion or illegal immigration or any other unpleasant real-life subject) and tells the player how they feel about the topic they stupidly destroy the immersion if the player's opinion is different. So this game sucks both in my opinion and as a CYOA.","December 29, 2014","false","0.4"," 25 of 61 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","25","61","0","2"

(Minor spoiler alert) I kinda wish it wasn't Carl/Carla or Tyler/Taylor, it would've been better, in my opinion, if the variants were of the same personality and powers, but different appearances (clothes and physical appearance) as well as different names.

That said, this was fun.  Relive the classic scenes from high school (and movies about high school) - the pep rally, the prom, the surprise exam - and address them with not only the benefit of hindsight, but also super-powers.   Unlike most superhero games, however, your powers don't involve flying, generating force fields, or blowing things up.  You have clairvoyance and maybe telepathy.  Those can be useful, but only in combination with social skills.  Used poorly, they can isolate you and mark you as a freak.

It was very interesting and i did enjoy playing and discovering all the rewards of options i chose. That being said, as much as i really liked it it could have been a lot better. it felt like a story that i would write in middleschool, trying to shove all my fictional and logical ideas and detail into one very short story. There was almost no room for character development which was a huge dissapointment. For example i had the option to date a cgharacter in the story but had no option to learn more about them other than the fact i had a crush on them appearently. The story would benifit very much with extra revisions but in general it was a good story filled with romance, fantasy, and desision making which i love in any game or work of literature.","June 26, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And hey, maybe it is, and maybe this game isn't for people who think they're too good for high school teen stories. Honestly, when I first saw the tagline "Teen supernatural mystery!", I was a bit put off, too, I'll admit.\n\nBut, over-all, in spite of the setting and concept which would normally be regaled to the young adult bargain bin at Barnes and Nobles (Does B&N even have bargain bins?) the game is, if not artfully crafted, very fun for those who are willing to not take themselves or CYOA games too seriously, and just engage in a bit of a simple and cliche story.\n\nMechanically, it's a bit above average compared to other Choice of Games stuff. There's multiple "morality stats", each one being played out at plenty of different points throughout the game. You have several "ability stats", which do directly influence your success at various choices - It is even possible to "lose" the game if you attempt to do something drastic that you don't have the ability level to do.\n\nStory and character wise, again, it's a bit simple and cliche, sure, but the characters are charming and engaging in spite of this. The most important thing for me, though, is the fact that, unlike several other "Choice" of Games titles, this one actually has significantly different endings depending on the choices you've made throughout the game. I won't spoil what these are, of course, but it is refreshing to see a CYOA where what you choose to do actually has impact, rather than just "(Character Name) will remember this." (They never do.)\n\nOverall: 8/10, don't play if you're too stuck-up to enjoy something a bit less cerebral than other CoG titles.","September 26, 2015","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some scenes really needed more detail and the characters should have become more memorable throughout the story, sadly they didn't. I didn't really mind the absence of graphics and music or soundeffects. It still was a nice experience.\n\nIn general I really appreciated the tons of options one could choose from throughout the story, although some sounded very much alike. It weren't answers that could lead one to either victory or dead randomly ... the outcome made sense. I've played enough interactive stories (visual novels) to be able to tell that this isn't always the case.\n\nErm... What I thought was a bit off, was the money... Did one only have to save it up for the prom? How superficial. What I also didn't like was, that I really couldn't understand how the stats would change. Sometimes I chose options I thought would boost my magic stat for example... But it either didn't increase or it dropped. Whuuuuut. Maybe my character just slacked off too much, don't know.\n\nWhat's more? Last but not least I liked the general look and feel. I don't know if the UI of the game is totally basic or not or if it's just considered basic but I liked it. One could check the stats and the achievements and oh well... it was nice.\n\nSo... I'd definitely recommend it. I mean, the story is nothing out of the ordinary but it is nice enough so it's definitely a game worth purchasing, even more so, since it's really at a fair price.","April 30","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
