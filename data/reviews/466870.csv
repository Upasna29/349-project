Back then, I knew how to recognize only a couple of them and the others remained a complete mystery to me. Until I played this little game.\n\nAurora Nights is more of an educational software rather than a game, since there's no actual playthrough apart from connecting the dots representing the stars that compose each constellation. Of the 88 officially recognized constellations, the game teaches you how to recognize the 35 most common, in a very enjoyable and relaxing way. Additionally, for each group of stars you can read a small text explaining the origins of their name, most of these descending from Greek mythology.\n\nIn my opinion, the game is worth the price, for it's unique and interesting concept and I hope to see in the future an extension to the game, featuring the remaining 53 constellations.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","May 28","true","2.2"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","1"

This product is not really a game, it is more of a mnemonic tool in a setting with a nice atmosphere.\n\nI have a few minor complaints about the game in its current state (as of the 26th of May 2016):\n- The star map doesn't completely fit on the screen (at 1080p that is)\n- A black band, saying ''constellation discovered covers constellations when completed\n- There is a small mistake on the starmap for Canes Venatici (the hunting dogs), it shows three stars instead of two.\n\nOverall, I really like the idea of this game and for 99 cents you can't really go wrong. Especially if you're interested in learning the basics of stargazing.\n","May 26","true","1.4"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","27","34","0","0"

These group of stars are called asterisms and are part of one or more constellations. Aurora Nights is a game about discovering constellations by finding the pattern and link the stars.\n\nAdditionally, there is an encyclopedia section with some backstory of each (35) constellation. You can replay the same constellation to gain more information entries but the stars will be shuffled.\n\nIt's more like an educational game but can be difficult if you disable the lines that indicates how the pattern continues. Therefore, it can be easily beaten if you're interesting for the constellation facts only, yet hard if you're looking for some challenge.\n\n---info---\nA nice approach to learn constellations\nGreek myth's all-over :P\nQuiet ambient sound\nBeatiful artwork but only one star-field background artwork\nAurora nights is the name but I didn't see much Aurora lights. :(","May 27","true","4.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","2"

It holds your hand and helps you see what stars are connected, and, as you play, will give less hints (and a better "rating") until you have the shape memorized--again, if that's what you want the takeaway from this to be.\n\nI, on the other hand, expected more background and history besides just citing Greek myths as a sole source/point of reference in the study of the cosmos. I would have like it if more varied sources were added as part of a more comprehensive package of information. This is particularly aggravating since in explaining some of the constellations, it'll literally say "other historians" or something akin to that. Lazy historical context.\n\nAh, but it's relaxing.","June 2","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
