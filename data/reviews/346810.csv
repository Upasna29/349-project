A fun little strategy game with some nice history and mechnics built in.  Nothing amazing, and not a lot of replay value after a few campaigns.  If you enjoy the period or just want something light to spend a few enjoyable hours with this is interesting.\n\nI would be aware that it only plays in a 1200X800 window or so, which is annoying, and the graphics generally are pretty minimal.

It's billed as being turn-based combat/strategy... which I guess it is, since you advance by clicking "next".  Overall, though, if you want to have a genuinely successful campaign, there's a proscribed set of steps for you to take.  Build X by turn ____, have Y by turn ____.  Sure, you're "free" to have things go horribly wrong... but most people don't play to fail their way to the end of the game.  In other words, it's less about strategy and more about just learning whatever build order the game expects from you.  It's not bad for a time-killer... but (as might be expected, given the developers / price range), it's not at all a worthwhile purchase.","April 23, 2015","false","3.0"," 120 of 155 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","120","155","0","0"

Casual, and a little cartoony but I sort of like the personality. It's simple with just enough depth to keep you interested and playing to find what will happen the next turn. It's a fun little slider manager type, with minimal twitch action and cause-effect results. The grammar is ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious though, "You are leaving city and losing everything. Without your wise rule, the city will soon be absorbed by more luckier neighbors."

Wait... gameplay? I didn't even know this game HAD any gameplay! Yeah, no, to be serious, the essentially only thing you do in this game is to assign/reassign your villagers to different tasks. That's it. No, really, that's it!\n\nOkay, sure, you can "research" some new "technologies", but unlike tech-trees in actual games such as Civilization or Endless Space, the ONLY thing the so-called "technology" in this game does is to raise the amount of villagers you can have, and how many villagers you can assign to specific tasks.\n\nBut frankly, that's about as substantial of an addition to the game's overall value as a single, paper-thin slice of cucumber is to a foot-long sub. In other words, none at all.\n\nThen there's the fact that despite the seemingly "culture neutral" nature of the name, you can ONLY play as the greeks. No foolin'. And unlike certain other greek-centric games, like Master of Olympus: Zeus, you don't get to explore greek myth, culture, legends or hell, even architecture!\n\nNo, you pick between Spartans or Athenians, and then depending on which one you picked, you either prepare to go to war against literally every single foreign party you encounter, or ragequit to the main menu and restart as the Spartans after losing 80% of your population after the first raiding party when you're the Athenians.\n\nThe insanely poor balance between the two barely even functionally different "factions" you can play as is laughable at best, and borderline depression-inducingly tragic at worst. Spartans get an invaluable military bonus, and the Athenians get just about bugger-it-up-the-ärse-all by comparison.\n\nAdding insult to insult and injury (that is, twice the insult to once the injury), the game has literally zero replayability. The game-world is STRICTLY pre-determined, down to what foreign parties you encounter, and their so-called "personalities".\n\nIf you can't have the mind-implodingly vast random-factor complexity of the Civilization series as a whole boasts, then that's fine, but really, if you're going to make us PAY for your shïtty game, then at LEAST give us ANY kind of incentive to play it for more than an hour, and then thank GabeN for the refund policy on Steam, simply because we could play better games literally for free on any flash-games site that's ever existed since before the words "Call of Duty" was any more than an actual military term. 0/10","December 17, 2015","false","3.2"," 94 of 149 people (63%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","63","94","149","9","10"

You can build an empire, conquer neighbors, go to war with Romans and Persians, and win or fail all inside an hour or two.\nThe game also has achievements for each stage of Greek history that you survive; and this game has re-playability, too, with an alternate campaign.\nThere is a Tech-Tree that is simple, yet entertaining; if you choose the wrong tech and get too cultivated and artsy, then you might get beaten by an army of barbarians, Romans, Persians, or others.\nThis game is not complex, it is simple; look for it on-sale and grab it if the price is right for you.\nI got it on a 50%-Off sale and I am delighted with it; easily at least 20 hours of 'casual' game-play to be had here.\nCheck out the Demo, first, if you have doubts.","May 15, 2015","true","6.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","20","22","2","0"

Basically you start off in the early history of man and you can be Sparta or Athens, both of which will completely change how the game plays out. This game is as much of a puzzle as it is a strategy, each time you play you want to do better than the last time by remembering specific events that happen, quests that you have to make ready for, the order that you want to research in, and what buildings you want to build first. Don't expect to be able to choose one resource and just go for it either, you really need to constantly be adapting to the changing needs of your civilization or you will quickly find yourself falling behind. The diplomacy and trading also offer another piece of the puzzle, and they are well done in that your choices will  have a significant impact on how the game turns out for you. As a whole I would say that if you like games like Total War or Civilization then you will really be able to appreciate the subtle complexity of this exceptionally entertaining game. 10/10","March 9, 2015","true","27.6"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","0"

As you play you'll research various upgrade paths that can unlock new buildings and improve your economy and army.\n\nOccasionally you'll be presented with a challenge, often the challenges will test your military and your economy, and often failing them still allows you to play albeit with penalties.\n\nAs you play you get scouts that can explore the world, and settlers that can build extra colonies to provide bonuses to your capital. As you uncover other civilizations, you can make peace with them which allows for trade, form alliances with them which helps your army during military events, and eventually buy land from them which can increase your population capacity. Alternately, if your army is big enough and buffed enough and you have a few generals, you can conquer them.\n\nAs you expand and unify Greece and Mesopotamia, you'll get to decide whether to form an empire or kingdom, and the world map will expand, what started centered around Greece becomes centered around all of western Europe, north Africa, and the middle east, and you encounter whole other civilizations. There are a variety of choices you get to make which can impact how you win, or lose, the game.\n\nOverall I'd say this is a great casual game, it's simple but endearing, and considering how cheap it is you could get a really good deal for your money.","March 10, 2015","true","4.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Thank you for making this review possible!\n\nFew words about the game\nPre-Civilization Marble Age is a quite complex but peaceful strategy game. You goal is to expand your territory, make alliances and just explore around your world. It's a really entertaining game, mostly thanks to being based on actual history, but still it's a nice way to spend free evening. It might not be the best strategy game around, especially with all those restrictions imposed by game as alot of potential development is wasted, yet it's one of the nicest I've personally played\n\nAdvantages\nLovely cartoon(ish) graphics and practical, adjustable in-game UI\nSurprisingly composite technologies tree that boosts up replay value of game a bit\nLets players refresh their knowledge about Greek history (which I like even more than my own)\nPrice is fair enough, especially when discounts are going on\n"Hundreds" (In about 2.5h gameplay occured only few of those) historical events makes gameplay a bit more varied and interesting\nDisadvantages\nSounds are crappy and music doesn't fit in game\nToo flash-like feel of a game\nShort and limited in capabilities of it\nSummary\nIt feels a bit like this game was left out too early, devs could give it a little more love, it deserves it. It also might be overwhelming for newcomers but after max. 1 hour, most of players should understand mechanics completely. Anyway, it's a pleasant game, with decent price tag, perfect to take a rest from bigger titles and just have fun expanding your little city with loads of random events on the way. Worth at least trying out!\n\nPersonal score\n6.5 / 10\nIf you find my review helpful or funny be sure to follow Opium Pulses curator page right here for more reviewed games!","March 2","true","3.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It is a flash game bundled into a steam app that they charge you for, but you get what you pay for.  The game plays a lot like a euro stype board game, moving workers around to collect resources while interacting with the rest of the world.  It is a lot like managing only one city in Civ.  The game does have a new game+ function that lets you carry over Civ points to make the next game easier.  First play through, I got the lowest victory and learned a bunch.  This gave me enought new game+ points to get 2 bonuses in the next game.  The second play through, I got the second best ending.  I think with the points I earned, I could pull off a top rated game in game three.  I will try here shortly.  If I do, then I can play as the second race, and I assume I will get the top score on my first try on that, then I wil be done with the game.  So, yeah, 4 play throughs and I will be done.

The controls work fine so i don´t see why i should judge the game for it´s port.\n\nThe gameplay is what really caught me. You´re just sliding some sliders to assign your workers but the level of depth behind it is pretty amazing. Seeing if you can´t get that building one turn earlier or defeat the incoming enemy wave this time, there is more strategy to it than it might seem at first glance. I enjoyed boardgames with this mechanic so i had no problem to love the polished version of it in this game.\nThat said tho, beating the game is hard and will take multiple tries to finally do so. Luckily a decent variety of starting perks and two different factions give a nice replayability.\n\nOnto the bad parts then. This point would usually mean i don´t recommend the game as i hate the word: random. There are some random elements that might or might not happen on which your success is based. Now as i think no game should have randomness in it, why am i still recommending it?\nBecuase those things felt miner and are not what i took from the game.\n\nIf you´re looking for a casual game to spend some hours on to finally beat and then set aside, i really had fun trying to figure out what comes next and how i could improve my play...","March 5","true","12.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Here's a few strong points: Accurate mapping, large degrees of micromanagement and lots of real events happening at the real times gave a bolder illusion of reality. It made me feel like I was a real ruler. I loved the cartooney graphics; when the models are on this scale they look really good. I enjoyed the variety of boosts and debuffs that you could have. The call the legions was great if you were Sparta (lots of generals so you can really take advantage of the 100k more units) and it was funny how on Easy you could use call the legions to get equal troops to the Romans and then overthrow them.\nI couldn't find many bad things to say about this game, but they are big enough to make a point of: Real shame I couldn't play as a different city in Greece/Different country. Maybe open up a mod workshop so this is possible? The fact that I couldn't specify EXACTLY how many people I wanted doing a thing really annoyed me (Major OCD). The biggest nagging problem I found was that the Justinian Plague was REALLY confusing. For some reason sometimes things were unusable and sometimes they were and I think that because it's the least straightforward of the events it should have at least a LITTLE bit of prior instruction so you don't fail on your first time getting to that point in the game.\nAll in all though, great game, I'd rate 9.2/10 in it's current state, and 9.8/10 if the issues are fixed.\n","November 28, 2015","true","17.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

There is some resource management and governance things, but the interface is streamlined and idiot-proof enough that you'll figure out how it works in a jiffy.\n\nThe game runs through about 300 turns and various events based on history pop-up throughout the campaign.  The goal is to achieve victory before the last turn, and there are awards / achievements depending how early you succeed.  This may seem repetitive, but there's a lot of variance with how you build your empire, allocate resources, conduct diplomacy, and quite a bit more.  The slick interface makes all of this very easy to manage and there are helpful indicators when events need your attention.  As an added bonus for beer-and-pretzel gamers, this one is 100% mouse-controllable.  :)\n\nIf you enjoy strategy games and maybe tycoon games, this one is an easy buy--heck, it's worth a lot more in terms of dollars per hour for me already.","March 8, 2015","true","48.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

There is a definite beginning and end to the game, but it doesn't feel like a complete, compelling experience.  You can choose between two different civilizations to play as, but there is no real variety; it's the same thing each and every time.  Normally, there is a degree of randomness and variety in strategy games that doesn't seem to be present here.  While there are extra screens for managing things like diplomacy and science, turns play out on a screen that represents what your civilization is doing.  You have a certain population, and you use sliders to increase or decrease the number of people assigned to particular tasks.  Each task generates one more resources for your civilization, and new tasks are unlocked by building new "buildings".\n\nSo, aside from dipping briefly into other screens when needed, all you do is adjust resource production on the main screen with slide controls, and click end turn.  I'm not at all opposed to games that use a minimal style--my favorite strategy game is MO1.  But something about it just doesn't work here and I can't recommend it at all.\n\nBut, as with all games that have demos, I recommend you try it for yourself and see if you like it.  I ended up buying it because it was heavily discounted and I wanted to see if the game improved.

It has a website, video gameplay example, good user interface, fun graphic animation, relaxing music, and good sound effects.\n\nAlso, because of the cheap price, very fast download speed, and simple graphics, it makes it playable for many people.\n\nHowever,\nIt is not that replayable because it only has two civilizations you can play, and after beating the game you cannot continue, but since it just got released, they have enough time to add more. Also, it did inherit some ideas of other games, and is not a new thing. But overall, this game is quite good and the develper(s) have potential to create more, easily assessible, and well develop games in the future. I look forward to it.\n\n---\nЭто хорошо develpoped и доступными для многих.\n\nЭто не плохо для игры в четыре доллара, это очень хорошо develeoped и довольно много усилий было вложено в эту игру , предполагая, чтодва человек команды сделал это . Он имеет веб-сайт, пример видео геймплей, хороший пользовательский интерфейс , весело графической анимацией , расслабляющая музыка , и хорошие звуковые эффекты.\n\nКроме того, из-за дешевой цене , очень быстрая скорость загрузки, и простой графикой , это делает его воспроизводиться для многих людей.\n\nТем не менее ,\nЭто не то, что replayable , потому что он имеет только две цивилизации можно играть , и после прохождения игры вы не можете продолжать , но, поскольку он только что получил освобожден, что они имеют достаточно времени, чтобы добавить больше. Кроме того, он сделал наследуют некоторые идеи других игр , и неновая вещь .

The talent tree is very linear. Although it seems that there are several choices, in reality you will unlock 90% of the talents in a mostly linear fashion due to being limited by "Tech level" requirements. The same goes for the Production tree. They're not well thought out, they only provide limit increases, and you're not really allowed to spec into certain parts of the production tree while ignoring others like a good talent tree should allow. You're basically limited to unlocking the entire first row, then the entire second row, then the entire third row.\n\nThere's no ability to really spec into any particular strength or weakness. If you wanted to make a colony with no army and become a massive trading civilization, you're ♥♥♥♥ out of luck because you're basically forced to make a half-♥♥♥♥♥ army since your talent tree in both culture and production incentivize doing so.\n\nIdunno.

Does get repetitive after a while but it's a nice game.\nBuy it if you can in a sale as £3.99 is quite steep.\nI do recommend it though, it's fun little game.","May 9","true","97.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
