You could start with say 5 on your side, but the enemy could start with say double that, and they keep respawning, calling reinforcments as well as the scripted stuff during the fight, it just becomes anoying that you may actually sit there swearing at your monitor, and this is on easy mode too, so much for easy mode huh.\n\nYou dont really have much freedom in the combat too, with only one right way to finish it really, as for now being able to choose who starts where, this is pathetic, you can only really place them where you would start anyways...like wtf?\n\nParts of the game is even in german still???\n\nFinally, bugs, game breaking bugs, after playing for a good few hours the game will lock up during combat, probably as it spawns so many enemys it gets confused, or the game will go limbo on you waiting for someone to take there turn but they never do.\n\nWord of warning, these lockups can not be sorted with ctrl alt delete, the only way to get rid of it is to hard reset your pc.\n\nSuch a shame i love the characters etc in this game, really want to love it, really wanted it to go on and on but with the same problems as the first, then you just got to avoid this game.\n\nIf they can make a balance sweep on it , if just for easy mode, and fix the damn game breaking bugs (there are more) then it would be my top TBC game, thats how close they are, but as i said, avoid it as balance is a issue, but you will end up with the game crashing etc at same point and not even being able to play further.\n\nEdit:\n\nI have just retried the game, i get so many bugs it is a joke.\nNo matter what save i load i will get one of the following:\n\n1 The game will freeze up\n2 The game waits for a character to move who doesnt\n3 A new bug just now, it was waiting fo rme to move Takate, who was not even in the party!\n\nFor love of all things, avoid this pile of poop.","January 22, 2015","false","15.9"," 333 of 426 people (78%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","78","333","426","26","7"

When I first learned of another BlackGuards game I was a little worried because the first had just come out not even one year ago. Unfortunately I was correct to feel that way because BlackGuards 2 is filled with bugs and FPS drops.\n\nI really like BlackGuards 2, but there always seems to be something that gets in the way of my enjoyment of the game. The first BlackGuards game was solid. I thought it could use some work, but it was a good game and I enjoyed playing through it with my created character.\n\nBlackGuards 2 took more than one step backwards, but also took a step in the right direction too. I don’t know why Daedalic Entertainment decided to take away the character creator in BlackGuards. This is something that really bugged me throughout my entire playthrough of the game. Cassia is a nice character, but I would have preferred to create my own protagonist like I could back in BlackGuards 1.\n\nYou could have told the exact same story and had the exact same supporting characters. The game would literally be no different. Well… the beginning of the game would be drastically different, but I’m not going to spoil it for those of you that haven’t played the game yet.\n\nAnother big problem that I have with BlackGuards 2 is the fixed camera. The camera angle is never in a good spot on any map. The only thing you can do is scroll all the way out for an overhead view of the area and even then there’s no guarantee that you’ll see the whole battlefield.\n\nThe cast of characters range from mediocre to average at best. I never felt connected with anyone in this game. The only remotely interesting character in the entire game is Cassia. I love her insanity and will to rule despite having no real reason to want to rule the world. You can actually have full conversations with yourself and it’s up to you how they play out. Talking to myself was by far the most interesting dialogue in the game because you get to see just how far Cassia has fallen.\n\nI mentioned that this game has it’s fair share of bugs. I can usually overlook some bugs and glitches, but I went through this entire game at 15-28 FPS. That is unacceptable; I can play Dragon Age Inquisition on Ultra at about 45-60 FPS. There is no reason why I shouldn’t be able to play this game at a solid 60 FPS. I even went as far as lowering the game to all the lowest settings and it didn’t make a difference and it really affected my playthrough.\n\nI couldn’t go through a single map without some serious lag. You’re probably thinking that I really hate this game so far, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. I like BlackGuards 2 and I really wanted to come here and give a good review, but I can’t ignore the problems that it has right now. Hopefully there’s going to be a day one patch to straighten out some of these issues.\n\nBlackGuards 2 isn’t all bad though. The one thing that BlackGuards always had going for it was gameplay and that’s no different here. BlackGuards 2 has really good gameplay. At the beginning of every battle you’ll have a chance to set your team up around the map. From there you’re placed on a grid and every character has a chance to perform an action. Some battles are pretty tricky while others might feel a little cheap because of the huge disadvantage that you’ll have.\n\nEvery fight is winnable with the right strategy, but there is a certain cheapness to it.  Another neat feature in BlackGuards 2 is the world map. The goal of the game is build a large enough army to take on the leader and rule the world.\n\nThere’s a problem with that though. I never actually felt like I was the leader of a massive army. Dragon Age Inquisition had this problem too, but it’s a much better game than BlackGuards 2. BlackGuards 2 is a solid sequel to a solid game, but it does have it’s fair share of problems right now. The truth is neither game would score very highly with me because of all the issues that they have and the developers have done nothing to really innovate the series.\n\nIf you’re considering BlackGuards 2 I would recommend you wait for it to go on sale because it’s not worth the asking price in it’s current state.\n\nThe Verdict: 6/10\n\nIf you disagree with my review that's fine, but don't think I won't block you if you start spamming me with insults. Keep it civil please. At the end of the day this is just one guy's opinion.","January 23, 2015","false","9.7"," 173 of 220 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","173","220","6","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/314830/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","Cassia is magnificent. Cast into a dismal oubliette and left to die with only a Machiavellian 'how to rule' handbook and a thousand venomous spiders for company, this betrayed noblewoman emerges horribly disfigured and horrifically insane from years of literal and figurative poison. Seeking violent revenge, she rallies the dregs of society and lawless mercenaries to her cause, marching across the lands and stopping at nothing to finally seize the throne for herself - including murder, torture and worse - both directing battle and directly bringing it with sword and spells.\n\nWe've seen plenty of female villains like her over the years... but in the twisted and morally bankrupt world of Blackguards, Cassia is our hero. The lesser of two evils, depending on how you play her, that is. She's a great and compelling new character carry a sequel, providing a solid emotional core to build two dozen hours of punishing hex strategy around. Blackguards 2 improves, expands and smartly cuts down upon its predecessor in a number of smart ways. Unfortunately, while you could describe Cassia as the 'Queen Of Bugs,' that's arguably a fitting label for the game itself too.\n\nLet's rip the bandage off: Blackguards 2 probably released too early. The original only launched a year before Blackguards 2 and it was clearly hustled out to make the most of the January lull. Though Daedelic have been busy fixing the worst offenders, such as some notorious mission-killing scripting errors, I've still encountered a lockup, floating ghost text and weird vendor issues. Things have improved dramatically and some players report no issues whatsoever, but even so, it's important you know that I can't guarantee a perfect and stable experience if you put money down. What I can guarantee you, though, is some seriously meaty strategy.\n\nThe story is much improved. Though it's fun to see how the three anti-heroes of the previous game are getting along after putting the band back together (Naurim and Zuraban are both on fine mopey form), Cassia is the star of the show. A far cry from the bland leading man of the first Blackguards, who was actually misunderstood rather than particularly evil, you have the freedom to exercise your vicious inner sadist.\n\nWhether torturing prisoners for intelligence, murdering rivals, allowing her underlings to commit atrocities or holding back to win the will of the people, she's either determined, depraved or a mix of the two. It's rare to see a game give you the room to develop a truly evil persona while still making the antihero sympathetic, even if workmanlike voice acting and awkward script localisation can rob a fair few lines of their desired impact.\n\nProgression and overall gameplay flow has also been significantly shored up. Blackguards 2 eventually opens up into an interconnected world of sorts as you battle your way towards the seat of power, capturing villages on the way to unlock bonuses and recruitable mercenaries. Enemies sometimes attempt to retake or besiege your holdings, making for an experience that feels much more dynamic. Coupled with a shorter and more muscular campaign (that's still about 23 hours long!), this effectively turns the padding of the original into optional grind, even if you'll sometimes feel forced to fall back when you'd rather push forward.\n\nThe main event, however, is still the brutal, tough and thought-provoking hex based combat that defined the original, based on the quirky Dark Eye tabletop ruleset. It's as deep and vicious as ever as you carefully weigh up initiative, movement ranges, choke points, defence and a dizzying array of skills and spells against mobs of durable and aggressive foes. The core gameplay remains largely unchanged, a top-down brutal brawl that rewards planning, blocking and clever spell placement rather than bulldozing, featuring a radial wheel that puts the nigh-overwhelming list of commands at your fingertips. Genre veterans will learn the basics relatively quickly, and will probably appreciate the improved level of detail, complexity and visual flair of the maps.\n\nThere's a case to be made that Blackguards 2 is as much a puzzle game as a strategy game, insofar as you'll still need to take full advantage of interactive scenery elements and traps to win (or at least avoid all of your victories being pyrrhic). Chandeliers and rock piles can be brought crashing down, tents burned and all manner of levers pulled to damage or debilitate enemies long enough to finish them off.\n\nSpeaking of RPGs, the roleplaying side of things is still present and correct. Your 'heroes' and expendable mercenaries all ascribe to specific combat roles with room to dabble in different builds, but Cassia is a completely blank slate capable of dominating in melee, magic, ranged, rogue-craft or a nuanced hybrid of the lot. Though the sheer amount of possibilities is overwhelming in the first handful of hours, seeing as you might not know how best to spec her until you've recruited your core stable of heroes, you'll soon realise that she's as flexible and fearsome a combatant as she is a tactician. Definitely sink a few Adventure Points into healing balm, mind -- you'll need it.\n\nUnfortunately, Blackguards 2 also increases the size and scale of the maps and battles without any additional streamlining to compensate. Each unit has to be moved individually every single turn using the slightly fiddly interface, while there's often a lot of ground to cover. Many missions can drag interminably over the course of 40+ minutes, not because you're agonising over how to position or use your troops, but just because it takes an age to get them where you want them. The unhelpful camera often doesn't help matters either, despite the essential top-down view.\n\nThis fussy and stodgy pacing, coupled with the need to defend your territory, muted voice acting, overwhelming depth, stern challenge and dour downbeat personality, can conspire to make Blackguards 2 feel like a bit of a slog. I frequently found myself starting a new level and thinking "argh, here we go again," rather than raring to go; a little more levity or playful writing could have worked wonders. Call me a weakling, but I was compelled to quit out from time to time just to centre myself and play something with more verve and energy. But I always came back. If you're a fan of the original or the genre, I reckon you'll do the same.\n\nBlackguards 2 delivers more brutal hex-based strategy and environmental puzzling while refining the original formula in several smart ways. The more open yet focused campaign, propped up by a fantastic central character who's as evil as you want her to be, makes for a satisfying if punishing experience. Though overlong battles and marathon sessions can become a slog, and you'll likely encounter some nasty bugs, there's still a great deal here to enjoy for strategy fans.","October 30, 2015","true","81.3"," 89 of 108 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","89","108","2","3"

Huge map with 33 locations, interesting story of revenge and madness and mysterious powers. Lots of sets of items which could be combined (armour sets etc), poisons, traps, potions, you name it...\nAnd it kept me hungry for more. Elaborate Spell and Skill trees, lots of options to develop the characters and then...\nIt's suddenly over! Out of the 33 locations on the map only 20 can be reached. the rest is decoration (not even DLC on the horizon to visit these places and continue the story) The whole item and skill system is oversized for the pretty straight forward story of revenge. I never got to try most of the poisons and traps and spells. The story just comes to a hasty end.\nFrom my point of view: A lot of effort went into the  design the platform for this game but halfway through it, the prorgammers realized that creating the scenarios was time consuming and was also delaying the final release date so they made a few shortcuts, dropped drastically the number of scenarios and just aimed at completing the story cycle to publish the game.\nAnd it's not a bad game! Despite being disappointed I would still buy addittional DLC if it provided the option to further develop the characters, have a new story and explore new locations.\n.\n","July 27, 2015","false","47.3"," 101 of 127 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","101","127","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeitzbach/recommended/314830/","zeitzbach","Enfys Ellezard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zeitzbach/","62 products in account","Blackguards 2 is a more combat-focus version of Blackguards 1.\n\nWhile BG 1 was an RNG fest, BG2 removed so many of the annoying RNG and made strategical plays and puzzle stages a lot more common. Boss fights have you running around trying to abuse the stage hazard to the fullest to win. Certain stages will force you to complete objectives and leave or face infinite spawns unlike the old one where you can kill EVERYTHING except for one stage where you run away from the poison.\n\nOutside of combat, you can now interact with characters more unlike the old one. You can capture prisoners, and interrogate them. Based on a choice, you can either make them spill the beans or spit at you. The informations required to make them answer can be obtained by paying for information from your beggar spies or by speaking around in your camp. After the interrogation, you can decide whether to hang them or let them go. Letting them go can be good but sometime, a certain person might come back to fight you again.\n\nThe customization has been greatly simplified. You no longer have the Strength, Charisma, etc from BG1. Instead, you just go with "+10 health" "+10 mana" "unlock tier 1 passive" in a straight line. Weapon level goes froml 1 - 100 and you unlock tier bonus at 50 80 100. While this means no weight limit from the removal of STR (Yes! No more weight issue!), it means much less customization. Even your mages will have as much hp as a fighter at the end making them unkillable.\n\nAnd with that, let's move on to the balancing.\n\nEndurance has been introduced. In BG1, all you had to do was buff someone and spam that 3x damage move like Hammer blow or Triple shot. You can't anymore. Endurance works like Astral point. When you use a combat skill, you use 10-20 points from you 40-80 endurance pool based on your stat. You regenerate a certain amount each turn based on passive (Endurance Regeneration) and gear bonus.\n\nYou can now have 100% hit rate. So much yes! If your offence (Hit rate) is high enough now to deal with their defense, you will always hit. Dodge and parry is one once per turn so sniping someone with a weak arrow first will move your hit rate on any further hit from 75% to 100% on the next one. Bow is a special case and its offense is reduced by range. You can easily check if you can hit people with bow now by simply holding X and moving around. It will show everything in range, the base hit rate and if the enemies are within the Line of Sight or not. Extremely useful and needed feature.\n\nDamage is now consistent. Assuming no armor, if it says 6 damage, it will always deal 6 damage. Skills like "Hammer blow" was nerfed from *3 damage to +10 damage.\n\nMost poison now lasts the entire fight and there are "Buff potions" around as well now.\n\nAnd if you have nothing to do with your belt slot, they introduced the "Trinket" items that will boost your status while you are holding. Higher crit rate, damage or regeneration. All up to you!\n\nYou can place your characters starting location at the start of the battle now!\n\nYou can place traps in defensive stages when the enemies decide to attack your base (For every 3-4 conquers, they will attack once)\n\nThis should cover most of the new features. Now we will move on to the last part. The pro and con of this games.\n\nPro\n\n-You now control an army. While everything was nerfed. this is because most combat now have you control 6-10 characters fighting against 6-15 characters as well. Before, you would just control one person with buff + Fast as lightning and tripleshot everything to death.\n\n-Less RNG. More strategical plays and planning required to beat the game.\n\n-Great dialogue just like BG1.\n\n-Set bonus! Yes! no more "Just armor rating +1 and encumbrance reduction" now. You actually get stats from wearing a certain set!\n\n-Your action now decide how good your characters will be and if they will be alive at the end or not. If you want, for the laugh of it, you can even order to execute your friends at the end before reloading a save after seeing their reactions.\n\nCon\n\n-Horribly unbalance. In BG1, all you do is abuse the same damaging weapon move like Triple shot or Hammer blow with buffs and fast as lightning to kill EVERYTHING. In BG2, with the damaging spell buffs and set items, mages are the most op beings ever in an army vs army fight. All you have to do is spam the same AoE spell to destroy everything in 3 - 4 turns assuming it's a "Kill everything" stage.\n\n-Defensive battle doesn't give AP. The fight is already having you fight with gimped characters.\n\n-Certain stage is horribly tedious, even more tedious than the last one. Infinite spawn happens every 2-3 stages and you have to do the "Rush in, Rush out" kind of gameplay. It's not fun because after you move all your 8 characters to the end of the stage, you also have to wait for the other 10 characters on the enemies side to move. You end up spending 10-15 minutes on this stage just waiting for everything to move. If only they would tone these down and give us a way to stop the spawning.\n\n-Very buggy. Still playable though.\n\n-There's only stage with the Lizard-chan throughout the whole game. WTF?\n\nFinal Verdict : 7/10.\n\nBlackguards 2 feel like a DLC content with improved mechanic because that's exactly what it is, but we also have to remember it's being sold at a DLC price as well. Also, NEED MORE ACHAZ FFS.","January 23, 2015","true","21.9"," 57 of 80 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","57","80","3","2"

The character development is lacking, except for the main character who has basically turned into a hypocritical nutjob who is incredibly hard to relate to. You find out more about the characters from the first game and they're not good things, characters I liked previously are hollow shells of their old Blackguards 1 selves.

For example attributes (courage, strength, cleverness etc.) have been removed completely. Makes character building a little more shallow.\n\nCompanions: Most disappointing thing for me. Your are restricted to the three known companions from the prequel: Naurim (dwarf), Takate (indigenous forest-man) and Zurbaran (human). While it's disappointing that you don't get to know more characters, the bigger problem for me is that having these 3 companions only narrows down the character building options for the main char (Cassia), when you want to cover all possible "archetypes" and especially when you want to build the companions according to their native concept. Naurim is the typical melee tank. Takate is more a dex fighter with a spear (dual whield blades would also fit). Zurbaran is a typical mage. While you could easily make anyone of them a ranged fighter, that just wouldn't fit their personality. You even could skill Zurbaran into a melee fighter but as he's the only one of the trio being able to cast magic, you'll lack a full mage. So if you stay true to their native concept and want to have a ranged fighter it more or less is a must to skill Cassia appropriately. And you should skill her magic a little as well (which even is advised in the manual), for having a (second) supporter for healing/buffing. So with these premieses, her building concept sadly is quite predefined.\nDaedalic could have solved this problem partially by adding a new companion. Best fit would have been a female elf archer: closes the gap of a lacking female companion, the lack of an elven companion and the gap of a ranged fighter companion. Perfect fit would have been Niam[blackguards.wikia.com] - but unfortunately they decided for her to get killed in the prequel.\n\nCollecting gear: A great deal of fun in these games is collecting and equipping your characters with better and better gear. While this works for some of the slots (1-2 armor changes for companions during the game), for other slots/characters you just don't find anything better during the whole game. For example my Naurim always fought with his personal axe. For Cassia (which was an archer in my playthrough) I haven't changed armor once as I haven't found anything better than her initial clothing. Takate's spear I changed only once too.\nAll in all too little occasions for improvements.\n\nCombat: The general idea of the combat is still good, though it's a little too easy now (played on normal). One con was the rather monotonous choice of opponents. Iirc there have been way more different opponents in the prequel.\nAnother strange thing where the "conjuring" circles and the organs. The mechanics behind it is that if you know a melody for a type of monster you can make the monster fight on your side when you play the organ (object on the map) while a monster of the appropriate type is standing in a circle. But I haven't encountered a single map where this strategy actually made sense. I don't know if I did something wrong. In attacking combats (when your troops attack a settlement) the circles and organs have always been unreachable until the very end of the fight. In defending combat there haven't been any appropriate monsters. So for me this feature was totally superfluous as I haven't used it at all.\n\nStory presentation: In the first hours of the game I felt as if I must have missed a cutscene or something. For me the setting with the 5 creator mages and their melodies hasn't been explained at all… I just learned about it incidentally on the way. It always felt as if the main char Cassia knew more about it than me.\n\nDefending battles: A new feature are the battles where you have to defend a settlement against Cassia's nemesis Marwan. While this sounded interesting, for me it became dull. In these battles you fight with your mercenaries only, so you can't see your built-up characters in action. Additionally you don't get any reward for winning. No XP, no gold. So when I was attacked (4-5x in total) it was always like "meh… not again".\n\nEpilogue: When you've won the final battle, you have a "town screen" in the throne room, where you can decide upon some characters' faiths. While this is ok, you also have the option to spend your new wealth on buildings for the city (schools etc.) by dialog options. Also you can do some actions (like going for a walk) by dialog options until a certain amount of hours is gone, where each action costs a certain amount of hours. I don't know what this scene of distributing ressources was for, but to me this all was totally useless. Perhaps they want to create a world state you can import into a sequel, but nevertheless this totally felt out of place to me.\nPros and conclusion:\nI've liked the rest of the game quite well although it was a little too easy. It's a nice genre mix and I'm giving bonus points for the TDE setting, so it's a 7/10 for me, thus being on a level with TDE: Demonicon, (vanilla) Shadowrun Returns and Risen 3 on my personal scale. For the prequel I gave 7,5/10, which was on a level with D:OS and Mars: War Logs.","February 17, 2015","true","35.7"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","30","41","0","1"

I find the game very  entertaining, it has not-too-easy tactical combats, tells an interesting story of a once lovely lady, that is made into an insane and kind-of-evil conquerer. The Player can also decide, if he is more like a Robin Hood-Rogue or a true brutal and ruthless bandit, who seeks only his own fortune.\n\nA big variety on weapons and spells, all based on the dark eye license (Das Schwarze Auge in german) and a lot of known places gives fans of DSA/The Dark Eye a great familiar feeling and everyone else a dense world, with its own logic, history and myths, that has grown for over 30 years.\n\nCompared to the first Blackguards, the Combats are bigger, offer more variety and a few very important changes have been made, that adjust the Dark-Eye-Ruleset to fit better into a PC Game. For example there are now exakt percentage-forcasts on your chances to hit, additional to Lifepoints and mana, there is now Stamina.\n\nYou do not only control a group of heroes but also get a mercenary army under your command with differnt classes of fighters or special units. With those troops you try to conquer the part of the World where the game takes place and you must repell sudden counterattacks from your AI-Opponent. This feels a bit like the good old Jagged Alliance with its sectors.\n\nOverall, Blackguards 2 is one of the game to really dive in for several hours/days.\n\nLooking forward to part 3 ;)","January 22, 2015","true","27.7"," 42 of 66 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","42","66","0","0"

Oh hell, you should!\n\nBut before I jump to feed you with my opinion I would like to adress some of the most common concerns I stumbled upon while reading other reviews.\n\n1. Le Bugs:\nEven though I could play my somewhat above 10 hours without running into any of them - yes, they exist. But the developers are obviously working their asses off to fix them (with the first fix being released only one day after launch). Also you shouldn't forget that it's not the developer who choses a release date, it's the publisher. Never before have I experienced such intense and quick user support on a launch. If you can't live with a few bugs on release, don't buy a game on release. Also, don't just walk away from this title, maybe just wait a little until the issues are fixed.\n\n2. The game being dumbed down:\nFirst of all it's hilarious how people complain about how the game appears so easy yet they also complain about it being unbalanced. Here's what changed to Blackguards 1 and how:\n- You have way less attributes, spells in tiers instead of slightly raising your skill until you hit a breakpoint, ect. As for the attributes, the system is still absolutely the same, it's just a different repesentation for you. So if you put a skill in "more Astral Energy", in the Background your intelligence gets higher. It's just easier to get what outcome your chosen skills have. For the Spells and their tiers...\n- spells now have a 100% chance of hitting, makes the fights more predictable and fair. Not easier though, as this is countered with enemies resistances. You won't just run through missions fireballing everything and that's it\n- new endurance-resource, that's to physical attacks what astral energy is to magical attacks.\n\n3. Difficulty and tactics:\nyes, this game is difficult as ♥♥♥♥. If you want a game without losing, without restarting because you made one too many mistakes, go play Hello Kitty Online, because this game is going to make you flip tables. But in a good way. At no point have I felt the game to be unfair. Insanely difficult, yes, but never unfair. There are a lot of mean surprises like a sudden new wave of enemies rushing in, and yes it can be frustrating to have to restart a battle because you became too sloppy with victory just before you, but as you replay a fight you improve your tactics and get rewarded herefore. If you play it safe instead of rushing through battles mindlessly, you get rewarded for it. That's exactly how it's supposed to be.\nThere are tons of strategial possibilities, with some of them being:\n- place your characters in a starting zone (least effect is that characters with high initiative won't get stuck in the behind - hehe)\n- strategic world map where your choice of what stronghold you're going to attack next really has an impact (least of the impacts is which of your mercs improve in what way)\n- various objectives and strategies for a lot (but not all) the battles\n- next to unlimited possibilities to skill you characters, providing your very own winning strategy (the main character having astral points by default is just great, I completely messed that one up in Blackguards 1)\n\n4 Graphics:\nYeah, so this is not Far Cry 4 or whatever game has the graphical high ground today, duh. If you care about the graphics, you will probably be disappointed. But if you care for atmosphere, impression and such, the graphics are just gold. It generally looks a lot like Blackguards 1, but far more polished, far more small details and impressive scenery. I just love it\n\n5. My opinion:\nSeing how big this review has become already, I'll try to make it short at this point:\nStory is awesome, looks are awesome, gameplay is awesome, difficulty is hell but I love it. Can't say anything about bugs as I haven't encountered any, but if that's the reason you don't want to buy the game - do yourself a favour and come back in a few days, get it wenn the bugs are gone, is so worth it!","January 23, 2015","true","17.8"," 37 of 61 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","37","61","2","0"

The story at least fits well to it. However, as someone who has been playing "The Dark Eye" for many, many, many years - the changes made to the character development system are too much removed from the original. Also, the need to make the game more appealing to the international market and thus including fewer aspects from Aventuria does not increase my connection to the game.\nOverall, it is an okay game. But I think there is not enough of Aventuria in it for fans of the world, and the game system does not offer enough to stand on its own.

I thought, hey where are my attributes, what have you done with the “Dark Eye” rule set and so on and so on. But as longer as I played in the last days the more I do like the new Blackguards 2.\n\nWell done, really well done. Game is faster now, less complicated and without the extremely luck factor you sometimes had in Blackguards 1 and you can go deeper in your strategy.\nNow it’s more reasonable what you have to do and when and why. I have a better feeling now before I fight because in my opinion BG 2 gives me more options and with that more challenging fights; fun included.\n\nThe changings allow you to have enough freedom in your character creation and it seems that some talents were redesigned for better gameplay. You need stamina now for your fighters and for the special attacks. This is neither good nor bad; just another change to give the game another feeling.\n\nWhat I really, really like is the new strategic map for your campaigns. Every conquered location or city gives you a bonus for your mercenaries. My wish for a third sequel would be even more strategy on exactly this map. This makes the game really awesome and now it’s not “only” a fantasy battle with a few characters.\n\nOne of the best tools in game is the new line of side tool which helps you a lot in range combat.\n\nSo, what does that mean? My conclusion on that is very simple, Blackguards 1 was good and solid, Blackguards 2 is better, the overall feeling is more compact now, BG is grown-up now.\nUnfortunately it seems there are a few bugs inside which affected some players lucky me no bugs for me at the moment. *fingers crossed*\n\nFor what I can see is, that the devs are very active in the forums and try helping people and fixing the bugs as fast as they can. For me this is a plus but to be honest in my opinion this should be the right way talking with your fans and customers. :)\n\nSo you think BG 1 was bad, than give B♥♥♥♥ try because it differs and it’s better.\nSo you think you have heard many obscure rumors, than give it a try because it’s worth your time and your money.\n\nJust my 2cents :)\n","January 23, 2015","true","54.2"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","29","49","0","0"

One minute I was murdering villagers to get more AP, the next I was letting prisoners go out of the kindness of my heart. Strangely it was all a lot of fun.\n\nAt first I didn't like the main character. She was a evil looking thing with boils covering half her face, but after her personality develops she is pretty interesting. I initially thought she was going to be evil the entire game, but not so. She turns out to be a pretty cool chick that just got in with some bad dudes.\n\nOne thing I wasn't so sure about is that you don't get to "make" your own character, but you can develop the main character anyway you want. Also she has a lot of speaking scenes and good voice acting which makes up for the inability to create your character from scratch. Also you only get 4 customizatable characters, which feels lacking to me for some reason. Also while they start off with alot to say, by mid game they just repeat the same old crap. One character, you can't even speak to after mid game. You see him sitting there, but that's it, you can't select to chat with him.\n\nI didn't really like the way items and equipment were introduced to the characters. Some weapon types had a lot of really good weapons, while others didn't have much. Maybe it was on a loot table and I just got the good sword items and missed out on the good axe items. Too bad no one in my group used swords.\n\nThe story was odd, as I said earlier, but still interesting. I saw a lot of choices, which I always tried to pick the good one, except when AP was up for grabs. The interrogation process was interesting, but I failed most of them. :P Finally I figured out that I should save before I start the interrogation, and reload after I fail it. During the interrogation, you try to figure out what is the best way to handled the one you are interrogating. You can intimidate them, lie to them, or make them an offer. From what I could tell, they provide you with some information is you get everything right. Like I said, I did fail most of these.\n\nThe character customization was pretty good too. You have a lot of stuff to spend your AP on. Almost everything is at least a little useful. The only problem is all your characters except Cassia come predisposed to certain weapon types, so it doesn't make sense to change it. I ended up using Naurim's starter axe through the entire game. I would of loved to have switched him to something better, but I just never found anything better.\n\nOn the battle field is where this game shines though. Lots of stuff to do, and losts of stuff to watch out for. Only problem with them is a lot of the maps aren't as developed as I would like, but still most battles are really fun.","January 27, 2015","true","38.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

I am a gamer since mid '80s, and almost explicitely play strategy and RPGs (not the action ones...).\n\nThis game is amazing fun. It's like fire emblem, but even better. It combiness strategy and RPG. It's neither dumbed down nor shallow on the contrary, it's deep and engaging. It throws you puzzles that you have to solve, so often you don't have to win by fighting, but by finding the right patterns. I played on hard and has been so far challenging and rewarding.\n\nSpeaking with nearly 40h playtime; I had encountered a few bugs during the first two days of release, but after the last patch all of them are fixed. I really don't get the complains about the broken and almost unplayable game (yup, I passed the druid and the adamant).\n\nIt runs very smoothly on my rig. I have no performance issues.\n\nFrankly, why don't they make more games like this? It's one of the best turn based strategies, I have played - and believe me I have played a lot.\n\nOverall, I loved this game and I would give it a 90/100. I recommend this to all players who are into strategy, puzzle solving and deep RPG rules.","January 25, 2015","true","72.6"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","17","29","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alienme/recommended/314830/","Alienme","Alienme","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Alienme/","142 products in account","I was skeptical to buy this game based on the reviews I read here on Steam. I am happy to say that I am so glad i ignored them! This was a great game. The mechanics are certainly scaled back from the first game, however any review should be based on how well a game stands on its own. So with that being said I greatly enjoyed the storyline. It was just engaging enough to carry you through the story, while not being too overbearing. I like the mercenary/troop upgrade system and also being able to supplement my battles with mercs to suit my combat needs. The only negative aspect, for me, was that even on easy some of the absolute randomness of the battles made some maps almost impossible, and others so easy you almost didnt even have to think about it. I found that the fast pace of the game had my team and mercenaries upgrading their skills formidably after every fight, which was different from the first game (or most RPGs). That made each new fight an excercise in "lets see what this new ability does" which kept it very fresh for me. I like the fact that there really are a few different paths to take to the end of the game. This and the random nature of the fights gives the game some level of replayability that is enjoyable.\n\nThe biggest downfalls are not dealbreakers, but for me they are:\n-Lack of ranged party member. If you do not roll your main character with bows or crossbows, you will not have a follower with that skillset. in the later game you could use excess points for this, but not for the first 3/4. I would like to try out a mage or warrior type but those are already covered with your "premade" party.\n-Cumbersome tooltip to tell if a new item is an upgrade. You have to physically click on the CURRENT item and then hover over the new item in question. It works, but its not explained.\n-Annoying "break the crystals before you can damage enemies" fights. seriously, just add extra enemies if you want it to be harder or at least only do this to us ONCE :P\n-Removal of base stats (strength/Dexterity/Etc). I understand why and it works, it is just a big departure.\n-Addition of enurance as a combat ability "mana". I am kind of on the fence with this because in the first game you could spam hard hitting abilities and now you have to think on that until your regeneration is higher. I like it but again, its a big departure.\n-little to no side quests.\n\nPositives:\n-actual storyline which is just interesting enough to pull you through the campaign but not complicated enough to make you skip tons of lore materials or quest dialog.\n-combat system is fun and rage inducing at the same time. The Guard ability on crossbows is rediculously fun when it executes well! Some of the spells are so fun to cast that you always look forward to doing it.\n-easy to understand and navigate map system. The bonuses you get from each capture point are very well presented and you can intelligently plan your own route of attacks to gain the upgrades you prefer instead of being stuck on a preplanned route.\n-nice system of character skill upgrades that upgrade very fast. You will always feel relatiuvely powerful, especially if you pay attention to the difficulty rating on each point of the map.\n-More but I cant think of them all.\n\nOverall for the money this is a great turn based RPG. Dont let the nay sayers talk you out of it. Its one of the best uses of 5 bucks in a while.","September 20, 2015","true","18.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","6","8","2","3"

However, it has a lot of quirks. It's kind of like having a boy-/girlfriend with a "manual". You don't really know how to handle him/her, but you find out over time. Sadly, in a game this is not necessarily a good thing, and it isn't in Blackguards 2. Though, that doesn't mean that it's really broken or not worth playing. Once you get past the initial difficulties (I'll have to refer you to other reviews for details), you will be able to appreciate the challenge. Right up to the point that the game gets too easy. Yes, gameplay is unbalanced in more than one way, sadly. Still, I had a pretty good time with it overall.\nGet it on sale or play XCOM instead. It's that simple.\n\nOn a technical side note, some of the larger maps (or not even that) tend to cause massive fps drops. I doubt it's the hardware.","March 4","true","48.8"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

So a friend recommended Blackguards 2 and I thought I should give it a try, even though I did not have much experience with DSA (i.e. The Dark Eye) except Shadows over Riva back in the day. I also heard a lot about Blackguards 2 being buggy and whatnot but worth its while. But to be safe (and for uni reasons) I waited until the newest Patch, which came out about two days ago.\n\nNow I played for roughly five hours so far and I think the peeps at Deadalic did a reasonable job because I didn’t encounter any of the errors that the reviewers kept on ranting about. For that matter I think I didn’t run into one at all. At one point Cassia might have said “okay” with Takate’s voice in a dialog, but then again it was running late and I was really tired.\n\nNow here is the thing: I didn’t want to stop! The game is fun, I like playing and thinking about the skills I am giving or will give every character to just make them a tad more efficient.

I might edit this review later on.\n\nBlackguards 2 is a turn-based RPG/tactic game set in the Dark Eye Universe.\n\nThe graphics:\nBlackguards 2 is not a AAA game especially regarding presentation techniques like graphics. But the artstyle is consistent. Some animations may be very rough and some textures only have a low resolution but in general the graphics look nice and atmospheric. 7/10\n\nSound:\nThe soundtrack is plain awesome! The music is atmospheric and fits the settings. ALso it doesn't repeat too often. Most voice-actors do a good job and the voices are fitting. 9/10\n\nThe atmosphere:\nThe world of Blackguards 2 is dark and brutal. The dialogues and the design of the locations and characters totally fit into that world and some locations are nothing less than epic. Unfortunately sometimes stiff animations break the immersion. 8/10\n\nGameplay:\nThe game is hard. Even in the beginning. Make one wrong step and you die. It is totally essentiall to know the skills of your characters. Every skill seems to be important. Though the skillsystem is slightly overwhelming at the beginning it allows carefull planning for the future.\nThere are often over a dozen characters at the same time in the battle and the arenas offer a lot of interactive objects. The developers used these to turn some battles into riddles. Tactic is much more important than luck!\nThe interface works well but is in some cases (especially trading and inventory) not very comfortable. 8/10\n\nWriting:\nThe story is a bit confusing at the beginning and has several timejumps. The main protagonist Cassia is, to say it frankly, a maniac. To make it short: I personally don't like her. I must admit that I don't even care for her and her story. Hopefully that will change soon...\nThe other characters instead are super! There are cool dynamics between them, everyone has his habits and background. Most dialogues are very funny to hear. 7/10\n\nSo in general I would rate the game with a 8 out of 10 and I will definitely continue to play it.","February 8, 2015","true","2.4"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","8","12","0","0"

The information has already scrolled away when you actually wanted to see what happened\n- Constant bottlenecks and blocked shots. Archers are mostly useless\n- The weapons set thing is super super poor. Coupled with lead-on battles (forced into next battle without ability to resupply, even from your own backpack) this leads to constant no-potion, no arrow battles.

Your 'loot' is fixed. The extra loot by opening a chest during a battle makes no sense. I've killed everybody, why would i not just open the chest. No - I must leave the final blow on the final guy so i can waste more time walking to a chest.\n- Merchants sell only useless weapons. There is nothing at all to aspire you to. Nothing to covert and help you decide where to put your skill points into.\n- You can really only complete most battles in one way. By that I mean you must have archers or fire spells etc.\n- Why are is your team 'victors against the nine hordes' so damn useless now.

You are taken while you sleep and put into the labyrinth under the arena left to rot until you die of starvation or the poison of the spiders that dwell there. After four years the poison starts to deform cassia and she starts becoming unhinged mentally until one urge overrides all the urge to rule. Cassia escapes the labyrinth and starts her quest for domination and revenge enlisting the aid of the silent legion and some much loved characters from the original game including Takate, Naurim and more.\n\nthe major addition in the sequel is the world map in which now is more like a conquest mode. The objective is to control the land and so you must attack each village, fort and settlement to unlock its town screen where you can gain access to their facilities such as shops. However its not all about attacking the enemy won't go down without a fight and they will try to reclaim their lost ground. Once your attacked you'll have to defend and unless your main characters are at the settlement at that time you won't be able to use them in battle. You'll be relying on the silent legion a lot through out the game.\n\nWhen defending you'll have the option of setting a certain number of traps before the engagement which always come in handy as you'll be facing a lot of enemy units when your on the defensive. Speaking of enemy units, the enemy variety in the game is very good in my opinion you have a mix of normal human enemies and monsters big and small that all require different tactics to take down. The monsters themselves often have a mechanic where you can take control of them if they are in the summoning circle once you've reached a certain point in the game. Boss battles often introduce new unique mechanics into battle that can be either fun or frustrating depending on your party makeup and level.\n\n\nThe core mechanics of the game haven't changed all that much since the original instead the developers have refined the mathematical checks in the combat to make small improvements here and there but nothing dramatic. One thing I noticed that has improved significantly was the hit chance rolls, often in the original you would miss your hits and this would happen frustratingly often. In the sequel however it seems that very few hits seem to miss and when they do its often down to various debuffs your character has acquired.\n\nUsable environments return to combat, crates, cranes, drawbridges and more can be used to your advantage in battle. Often the environmental objects can be used to change the landscape of battle for example destroying the main bridge across a gorge to force your enemies round the side paths. The interact-able objects in battle is something I have always enjoyed in Blackguards and its adds a nice tactical depth to each different map you fight on.\n\nA major problem with the game was that it was very buggy. Everything from computer crashes, AI mishaps and graphical glitches are present. The developers do patch the game fairly regularly to improve balance and stability however the sheer amount of bugs led me to believe that the games launch had been rushed best and at worst not properly QA tested.\n\nWhere the game has significantly improved in my opinion is the story. Playing as the scorned Cassia is very intriguing and fun. The story allows you to make decisions as a ruler would, do you be cruel or merciful? Do you hang an old friend who betrayed you? Enlist them to your cause? Or let them go? Blackguards 1 relied heavily on the cast of characters to supply the interest rather than the playable main character where as in this you have a interesting female lead with the interesting and often funny characters from the first. The story itself is well written for the most part and the voice acting is not bad at all, Cassia herself is a dark character so your not playing a hero or villain, your playing a mix of both in some cases. The story-line is dark and riddled with choices, its in my opinion far better than the first games story.\n\nMy biggest disappointment with blackguards 2 is that its essentially the same game as the first. Reused assets and more are common and it looks and feels more like a good expansion rather than a full sequel.\nI think the developers have done really well with the story but should have added a new land or new areas to explore. While the new conquest system on the map is fun and expanding your forces and empire, its still the same locations with the same backgrounds. I also think that should have expanded the available items such as weapons and armor a lot more than they have to allow much more customization to the game.\n\nOverall Blackguards 2 is not a terrible game and would be a lot better once the stability has improved with patches. I still think its more of a fleshed out expansion than a true sequel. Fans of the original will be more than right at home as its basically the same game with improvements. If you enjoy tactical turn based games than I certainly recommend blackguards 2 as its combat is pretty solid and the story is much more interesting than the original. I still think it will put some people off with its slow paced nature but that game does have a certain character and charm about it.\n","February 17, 2015","true","12.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I was really excited when the first Blackguards was released. It wasn’t the game I was expecting but still good with some interesting features and a thrilling combat system.\nTherefore I knew what to expect from Blackguards 2 … and I was still surprised! In a positive way! The story is more interesting and the characters even more well-rounded than in the first one! As soon as you start you feel pity and a disgusted by Cassia!\nThe combat itself hasn’t changed a lot which is good in my eyes! I like the strategic approach and the possibility to use the environment for your advantage. It’s not always easy too keep track of the entire map but that doesn’t hurt. Spells always work and also you normally hit enemy when you attack. This is something I was skeptical about but as it turns out the battles feel more dynamic and faster which is big plus!\nWhat has changed is the character development and again for the better! Even I, knowing and loving the complexity of the Dark Eye rule books was confused and overwhelmed! So the new approach is way more user friendly and even for beginners easy to get into as there are always information available what the e.g. talent improves. Also you can develop “your” Cassia more into the direction you want during the game and not thinking “shame, should’ve chosen blablabla right at the start..”\nThe game definitely has developed since the first part! Positively! For anyone with a hang towards strategic hex-field battles in fantasy settings this game is a must!

Slaves, guards, and even mythical creatures will try to thwart your path of destruction, but with superior strategy you will overcome them all. Blackguards 2 is a game centered around Cassia of Tenos, who collects the Gladiators from the previous Blackguards title to assist her with domination of the realm. There are so many unique mechanics at play, such as being able to shoot over the heads of those shorter than you and extremely interactive environments. All this makes Blackguards 2 one hell of a strategic romp. It does fall short in a couple places, but overall the presentation is wonderful. Each level is exceedingly difficult on the first time around, but the fantastic story that unfolds before and after each fight keeps me constantly thirsting for more. Without further adieu, lets delve into Blackguards 2.\n\nAs with the original, the story of Blackguards 2 is quite dark. Your main character is painted as completely insane within the first 30 minutes of playing, but she has her reasons. When asked by anyone why she’s out for conquest, she answers “There is no why. Does the wind need a reason to blow?” Hell truly hath no fury like a woman scorned. You are not the good guys in this game, but Cassia’s intentions aren’t entirely based on whimsy either. The odds are stacked against her, but her first order of business is to set free bands of murderers from all the local prisons. Daedelic Entertainment does a great job of exploring a moral gray area. There is a grim feeling to almost everything you see which makes for a fantastic aesthetic. The ominous look is kept up throughout the game, even in levels when the sun is shining bright. The music is good, but slightly understated. I’d like to see a bit more attention drawn to their good soundtrack.\n\nThe skill trees have been massively simplified from the original Blackguards, which is a great thing. Spells and skills are now all straightforward, with costs and prerequisites laid out plain as day. Combat is exactly what it needs to be as well, left-click to move and right click to open a wheel filled with options, from spells to taking cover to ending the turn. Strategy is not a term used lightly in this game, characters will move in a set order based on initiative and cannot pass through friendly units on adjacent tiles. My first few matches involved a lot of bungling with characters being blocked in by their cohorts and having to pass the turn. You need to utilize every part of the environment, and your squad if you hope to make it out alive. This game pulls no punches. There is no inventory screen, so health potions can only be used from your belt and this means each hero can only carry one per fight. So use extreme caution.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Blackguards 2 greatly. The story is bleak, but witty. The characters are well-written, and relatable. I will say that the UI feels a bit clunky with enemy targeting, due to having multiple ways to cast a spell. The tutorial is also unabashedly long, clocking in at about 2 hours with cutscenes included. Lastly, I lament the removal of character creation, which the original Blackguards  did feature. Despite its flaws, the game is extremely replayable due to being able to build your characters’ abilities any way you please. Voice-acting, graphics, sound, and story all mesh together beautifully into something that I plan to play again. Big thanks to Daedalic Entertainment for allowing me to review Blackguards 2, and for always offering such fantastic stories. Hope to see Blackguards 3 some day soon.\n\nSummary: Superior 4x strategic fantasy combat with an amazing story.\nFinal Score: 7/10 for aesthetic, replayability, and story-telling.\n\nFull text/photo review: http://www.indiegamebundles.com/review-blackguards-2/\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3s4s9kK02Cg","February 10, 2015","true","4.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

As for the streamlined inovations- what they did was gut the Dark Eye rules out of the game keeping a few things in name only and made it so it is no longer based off attributes at all. That is correct they decided that we are too stupid to understand attributes and they needed to go. Skills have been minimized to an extreme and weapon skills now range into ridiculously high numbers in comparison to non-weapon skills (teir one with a weapon is something like a value of 50). I love the Dark Eye rules and I loved the first game because it was a complicated tactical rpg. This is just a sad money grab at best. That being said if you didnt like the first game because you couldnt figure out the mechanics maybe this will be better for you... as long as playing a lunatic, tumor ridden woman is your idea of a good protagonist. After all if you dont take the dark fantasy anti-hero concept and beat us over the head with it until we cry  we wont get it. If it isnt clear I really want my 31 bucks back.","January 24, 2015","false","1.7"," 27 of 51 people (53%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","53","27","51","2","0"

I really like this aspect of Blackguards since only a few games get turn based combat right.\n\n- Witty and funny dialogue, this is one of the main reasons this game is charming\n\n- Art and Sound are great just like in the first Blackguards.\n\n- The Character building was streamlined and it is now harder to spec your character into a dead end. Removing some of the choices did not really dimminish the DSA rulesets.\n\n-Most major bugs have been squashed after the lastest patch.\n\nNegative aspects:\n\n\n- Performance Issues related mostly to bad optimisation, the Engine is the same as Blackguards 1 and it feels like there are still the same issues present like the first one and there was no optimisation done.\n\n- Some mission designs are very frustrating, the missions usually are challenging which is nice, but some missions are simply a test of will not to jump from a roof after you have to reload the mission for the 50th time because it either bugs out or the mission itself makes it near impossible to be beaten if you are not lucky.\n\n- The Story and dialogue options dry up after half the towns are taken over. I have not had any new "banter" conversations after being done halfway from the game. The first Blackguards was far superior in Story and Character Design.\n\n\nOverall the game is fun to play if you like tactical round based combat. The story and dialogue is good to a certain point however not troughout the whole game which saddens me.\n\nCurrently there are too many issues with the game so I recomment waiting a little bit till the worst bugs are fixed and hopefully the game a little bit revised.","January 25, 2015","true","17.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

I went into Blackguards 2 hoping that they would build upon the Original Blackguards and address the issues in it. Man did they ♥♥♥♥ up.\n\nDaedalic seemed to want attract a broader audience to this game, and one of the ways they tried this was to simplify the chaarcter creation system by removing attributes (Str. Con.). How does this affect the game? Well now, spells cannot faily , so in their attempt to make the game easier, they made it more unbalanced. There are other isues with mages in this game like the fact that wearing heavy armor is barely a penalty fo them, but the balancing is not my main problem.\n\nGod damn, do I hate the encounters in this game.

Instead of rolling your own character as you did in Blackguards, Blackguards 2 has you play from the perspective of the Lady Cassia of Tenos, who is imprisoned for years in a spider infested dungeon. Disfigured and Demented after years of spider's poison, the tutorial takes you through the Labyrinth she is imprisoned in and teaches you the basics of the game. Lady Cassia can be customized for play more as a warrior, mage, or hunter, or even a hybrid if you choose.  You will lead various companions along the way whom you save or recruit on your travels to help you.

The game was not very deep and once you figured out a simple strategy, you could take that all the way to the end without the need to switch things up.\n\nThe game was also rather annoying when it forces you to do things you just don't care about. Or when the "dynamic feature" of the bad guy attacking your cities and you must defend it only with simple units... the annoying part about this is the actual time it takes for movement of units.

A fresh tactical combat system, a reasonable story, excellent voice acting and moderate game mechanics tying it all together. The combats are quick, so if you have to "try again" because you realized you didn't quite see the mission puzzle, you don't lose much time. The variety of playstyles makes some fights easier, some harder, but it seems there are many feasible ways to skin this cat... thus I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on many of the negative reviews I've read about the difficulty curve. Just be imaginitve.\n\nDo the choices change huge things? No. But that's what makes them good ethical dilemas. You're not min-maxing for an item/skill or possibly even an ending, you're making very personal choices  that get a nod from within the game and you get the opportunity to reflect on why you (or Cassia and company) made such choices. To that end, good job there.\n\nThere are a few minor bugs. I had a game breaking one very early on that never repeated, but everything else was cosmetic. In the sea of buggy/lame crap I've been playing, this turned out quite good.\n\nIf you like tactical combat with reasonable RPG elements and a decent fantasy story, this is really worth your while.","May 4, 2015","true","34.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Never buy at full price. (there is a longer story,beyond recomendations)\n\nRecomendations:\n*if you guys wanna shift the balance of the game more towards macro strategy(managing armies empires and such) then I recomend you guys take notes from the Conquest Mode of Star Wars Battlefront 2 as it is your best bet towards making Blackguards 3 a strategy rpg game about the horatian empire attacking a divided Emirate without loosing fans of the core rpg game.\nAlso being able to give new purpose to a conquered teritory might not be a bad ideea...maybe I wanted to turn the fishing village into a blackmarket, or turn the hunters camp into a mercenary recruitment camp to get more liutenants with advantced fortifications to guard agains invaders.\n\n*if you guys want to reinforce the Blackguards series as an rpg,then how about giving us companions that start out with a near empty character sheet and a good amount of AP to get the builds players want going. Another thing you could do to make the Blackguards series awesome is to give us co-op in the form of a game mod similar to chess,with 5 characters each player within a randomly generated arena.Or maybe just have us play as the law enforces in the lawless world of Aventuria,next time.\n\n*overall I think that being able to play Blackguards 1,using the rule set of Blackguards 2, through a DLC-mod would be the ideal way for us to experience the freedom of the new skill tree sistem,until you guys think of a good story for Blackguards 3.\n\nLong story: beware of spoilers from here on\nBefore we kick into high gear I would like to point out that the "good" ending is not very inuitive.I got the petrifier to petrify Marawan (which seems as the ideal way to end that conflict and youtube videos confirm it) but that does not induce a victory state and I have no bloody clue what to do to get my desired ending.Now let's kick it into high gear.\n\nSTORY WISE, Blackguards 2 feels like an unfinished game, because the reasons why the Horatian Empire are interested in helping Cassia and why does the Horatian Empire belive that Cassia stands a chance againts her husband considering the fact that prior to her imprisonment she had no interest in warfare (at least according to what I understood of the story) is not properly explained and expanded upon...in other words it makes no bloody sense that the Horatian Empire wants to help Casia by giving her weapons.\n\nFrom a gameplay point of view I can assure the devs that 4 is not your magic number because all the sense of freedom your skill system provides is canceled out by the fact that you are forced to play with 2 STRONG predefinied melee characters(it makes no sense to have these guys fire/waste arrows in this game) and 1 predefined mage (we will ignore the mercs here as they are irelevant in most boss fights) giving us little character development for Casia (mage,archer or mage-archer feel like the default choice because the predefined melee characters are very good).\n\nI would also like to point out that Casia is not an easy character to role play because she feels like a darker version of Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones and is exposed to stereotipization due to the fact that she has magical powers,a need to maintain control, gentle heart, power hungry, hurt and angry at the world and crazy as fxxK due to spider venom makes her (from my perspective and probably Naurim's as well) someone I would NOT like to fight alongside in melee range as I am afraid she might get high on adreline and slit my throat + I already have a sane but narcistic gladiator as a partener (Takate the first game character I developed a bromance with).\n\n\nMy ideal fix to the above issues would be an expansion that introduces a fully customizable ambasador from the Horatian Empire to give more sense to the implication of the Horatian Empire story, while making feel more deep and interesting at the same...recruiting him at the fishers village seems like the most logical course of action.\n\n5 was always the magic number for the Blackguards series, in my honest opinion,as the most awesome quests (looking at you Flying Foxes) took place when the party was at 5,because in a party of 5 you have 2 melee characters, 2 range/mage characters and the playable character in this format has the necesary freedom to become whatever without damaging the party composition, which is a good thing considering that the skill tree is designed to allow us as players creative freedom over 1 character. This also give predefined characters some breathing space as well. In Blackguards 1,because my party was at 5,I felt more comfortable changing combat formations,investing in Takate enough AP to make him good with a bow and arrows to unleash some range aoe damage as my playable battle mage charges to the front with 0 astral energy to take his place.\n\nI would also like to point out that removing the ability of epilifactus shadow force to use weapon based special abilities is beyond bad as it pushes Casia even further away from the notion of having her as a battle mage in the game, unless she dual wields. I dislike dual wielding,I prefer a two handed sword. The absence of a metalic armor set that feels good for battle mages is also something that inhibated my desire to build Casia as a melee weapon wielding battle mage. If rank 3 could use the weapon skills of the caster then I would consider the spell both balanced and worthwile.\n\nBefore I conclude I must say that I disagree with the notion of having staves and axes bundled up in the same category because they are 2 different weapons that are used in different and unrelated combat styles (it's easier to feint and counter attack with a staff then with an axe,but an axe is more effective at chopping people up.","May 11, 2015","true","37.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While I preferred the first game's character customization with the stats, the battles in 2 were more intense and included many more combatants.  The random number generator was significantly less frustrating.  It's hard to pick a favorite.  Both are amazing TRPGs.  Some believe this game feels like DLC for #1, and while I understand how you can get that impression (most music tracks in #2 are from #1), the world map and battles play quite differently.  There's enough content here to justify the sequel status, in my opinion.\n\nWhat I liked about Blackguards 2.\n* Battles were very intense.  The player can't always win with brute force (in fact, a great deal of battles will result in defeat if the player opts for brute force).  I took ONE LOOK at the field during the fight against the druid, my group surrounded by the treant chimearas, and didn't think there was any hope of success.  I ended up succeeding on my first attempt with the help of 2 well-placed fireballs (they unexpectedly grouped together).  A lot of battles had me thinking "What the heck am I going to do to win this?!" and occasionally required a second attempt.\n* The return of Takate, Zurburan and Naurim from 1 was appreciated.\n* Huge battles.  The number of combatants in #1 (the unit portraits) never exceeded my screen's capacity, but the majority of the battles in #2 wrapped around.\n* Contains multiple endings.  I think if I had played differently, the main character survives.  (I'll be back, just you wait #2.)\n* The ability to have a magic-user wearing armor without penalty potentially allows for some very interesting hybrid options for Zurburan and the main character.\n* I felt there were more than enough character points to complete what I wanted for all of my characters.\n\nWhat I didn't like.\n* Stats were dropped completely, dumbing down character customization and nearly completely removing the table-top RPG feel that the first game had.  This loss of stats affected the spells a lot.  The creators decided to hold on to every spell from #1 and alter them to keep them relevant.  I don't think it worked.  Many spells became nearly useless.\n* I prefer an adventuring party with mercenary assistance over a conquering horde.  Having to defend territories already claimed was a nuisance.  I hope it wasn't added just to increase play time.\n* The narrator's voice annoyed the snot out of me.  I found myself pressing multiple buttons trying to shut him up, as I had already read the words.\n* The story was there, but it was narrated more than acted out with the characters.\n\nOverall, this provides more of what I'm looking for.  More tactical RPG awesomeness.  I'm glad I didn't pass this series up.","November 29, 2015","true","36.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/recommended/314830/","Zanduar","Zengineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanduar/","480 products in account","Little strategy, impossible tactics.\n\nIf you play this game you will most likely end up searching for help. Unfortunately besides some barely helpful secrets that are only found through repeatedly losing a battle there isn't much help to be found. The strategy in this game doesn't occur when playing offense. You are almost always forced to join the battle in a small area which is usually directly opposite the enemy. The enemy can start anywhere and with the frequently appearing “Insectoid” enemy they can fly anywhere. Most of the battles have the player at a statistical disadvantage on a unit “level” basis. When enemies are below your level you'll find yourself killing them quickly anyhow but even with enemies you can kill in one hit the biggest tactic the game uses is to throw an unlimited number of enemies at you while giving you a limited objective. That objective is often to make it to the other side of the map while flipping switches or destroying objects to open the path. When there are an unlimited number of units the game becomes a “Traffic Jam” RPG. How do you take your characters from point A to point B past an infinite number of enemies who outrank you? The answer is simple. You lose until the game spawns enemies in a particular pattern that allows you to make it through.\n\nWhen strategy does appear it is while playing defense. Defense seems to just be in the game to artificially extend the length of the game. You choose where to place a limited number of traps in set locations and you are forced to choose a limited number of units in set locations. The only time you'll lose a defensive battle is when the game simply throws a large number of enemy units at you. The game can send more units at seemingly any time even when on defense.\n\nThe “Hell Organs” used to play “Melodies” to control “Creations” are almost useless. They require the enemy player to be completely inside a circle drawn on the battlefield while the player uses the Hell Organ to play a Melody. At the start of the game if you are lucky enough for these conditions to occur you can switch the enemy over to your side. Sadly as the game progresses you are required to beat specific bosses, often a multi-stage battle, in order to play a melody. As said before the “Insectoid” enemy appears in almost every battle. However the “Insectoid” boss is pretty much the last “Creator” boss you'll face so controlling them beyond the first few stages is impossible.\n\nThe character progression is the same as in the first Blackguards game. The only improvement on the first game seems to be that they allow you to unlock special abilities and spells at anytime between stages. I've been using the term stages because some stages can be one battle or they can be three. Specialization is the key to winning when building a character, especially for spell casters. As skills progress they cost more and more, even with arbitrary boosts in the cost of improving weapon skills such as the cost of going from skill level 99 to 100 being hundreds of points more than the previous cost.\n\nIt comes as no surprise that there is little choice in the story of the game given that there is little choice while playing. This is not a classic Tolkien based RPG. The story itself is original and could have given the player a wide variety of choice. Instead the main choice is whether or not to kill prisoners and at the end whether or not to kill your allies. These choices have little impact on the game and the real impact comes from paying for information from an NPC named “Riz.” The uses of Riz's information helps in future battles and allows you to successfully interrogate prisoners before you decide whether or not to kill them. Saving or killing your prisoners will both hurt you in the end so in my opinion it is better to just kill them all.\n\nIn the end I was deeply disappointed by Blackguards 2. The first game was promising but this game seems to have been made simply to reuse the core mechanics for the first for profit.","June 6, 2015","false","28.3"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","3","8","0","0"

I’ve got it, but it was one of those games that I just kept looking at in my library and never got around to playing more than 30 minutes of it. On the other hand, some people have said that the sequel fixes some of the problems that the first game had. Either way, I’m coming into Blackguards 2 with a fresh, open outlook and I was totally excited to play this game.\n\nI’ve really only got two gripes for the game and I want to get them out-of-the-way since they aren’t very large. The first is the targeting system. It seems well enough at first, but if you continue to play you’ll start to notice that sometimes where your cursor is doesn’t exactly target what you aiming at… or anything at all. I’ve spent some time moving my cursor to a hex to target a bad guy only to have it not register anything in that space. So I’d just move it back and forth until it realized that there was a bad guy I wanted to stab. It’s small, but if/when you’re losing a battle, this could make you start swearing.\n\nThe other issue I have is that there are some maps where it’s obvious in what you’re to do and others where only the beginning is implied. My main example will be a map where you went to free some prisoners. Up until this point and most of the time afterwards, the objective has been, get in -> kill everything that isn’t you -> win. I get here and the bad guys just don’t stop coming! It’s getting a bit overwhelming and the prisoners I’m freeing aren’t that great with their fists so this battle was going downhill fast. I took a chance and made for the other side of the map and my guy disappeared. So apparently that’s an exit? I had to file my guys out one at a time to something wasn’t really marked as an exit. This also defied what they have been teaching me so far in the game about clearing a stage. It feels nit-picky now that I’ve written it down, but it was pretty upsetting at the time.\n\nSpeccing your character and the difficulty in this game are closely related. I can’t tell you how many times I restarted the “tutorial dungeon escape” run because I wasn’t satisfied with how I specced the main character Cassia. Did I want to be a full-blown archer? Casting spells is pretty good too though… Then you get into the “well what are they going to give me as comrades later on?” I don’t really want to double up… so I don’t want to be a caster really. They also give you some mercenaries to play with and they could be your archers, but you can’t use them every single match and you only get so many points to use for each character… it starts to make you worry that you’ll not make the best choice and end up lamenting putting points into certain skills (second playthrough much?)\n\nYou know, if all the moves didn’t seem so cool to have I would probably have less of an issue with it. As it stands, all of my characters have almost the maxed out dodge stats because that is always useful and has panned out so far. There has been so many times that I wished more than one of my people had the capability to use magical attacks. Conversely, I don’t want to be creating jacks of all trades, masters of none. I want my guys to have a specific roles and be awesome at it so I spend the points with a purpose. I still don’t really have an archer, but dang it my Cassia will tank like a boss! She also heals so I guess she’s like my paladin. (I still want an archer though.)\n\nThe combat, while I’m not fighting the cursor, is rather satisfying. I love how the magic works and looks when a fireball soars across the field leaving flame trails. The hits from each weapon sound decent and look like they hit hard (which usually makes me flinch when my guys get hit.) While everything outside of combat is done with a still picture (mostly) or a monochromatic sketch, it looks good none-the-less. From what I did get out of playing the original, I love the overworld map a million times more. It’s a map now and not some bland lines that just appear. You are now trying to conquer the land and you have to move from one city to the next all the while defending what comes back under attack. It’s alive and fantastic.\n\nI think the biggest thing for me so far is the voice acting. I love how varied they all sound and the dialogue is fun. It’s dark, don’t get me wrong, this is not a kiddie RPG, but neither is it depressing. There is more to the characters than what is on the surface. You can interact with each of them between fights at your camp and take certain conversations paths to give them a certain impression of yourself that you want to give off while finding out more about them and how they came to where they’re at. On your end, are the you the ruler that people will love or fear? Why do you actually want to rule? These and many more decisions will come up while you are talking to your main cast of characters and your legion of mercenaries. Will you take the moral high-ground, will you debate that there isn’t one in war or will you just not care?\n\nGoing back to the map and to wrap all of this up. The world looks more massive than what looks like could be the end of the game. I’m not sure since I haven’t got to far to the left yet, but I wouldn’t mind continuing on fighting so I could have some of my people be amazing with more than two types of weapons. There’s also the hope that I’ll find better loot later on down the line. (Right now I don’t have much hope for that so it all is coming down to the individual spec.) Sometimes given my schedule, I don’t return to many games that I’ve done a review for already. I may end up making an exception for Blackguards 2 and that is a good thing.\n\nScore: Gewd./Tasty!\n\nI may not have played the first one enough to give a in-depth breakdown of why one is better than the other, but I like Blackguards 2 more. I love the interplay between the characters (even though I feel I'm getting spoilers for the first game when I get back to it.) I love the choice system for the dialogue as well and being able to be as much of a good guy/gal as I can. It's challenging without being overly frustrating. Blackguards 2 is a solid buy for Tactical RPG fans. It may not be the best in the genre, but it sure is fun.","April 5, 2015","true","14.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are beloved  characters (Naurim, Zurbaran, et al.)  making their returns, and an all-new story of politics and revenge.\n\nSome of the awkward aspects of the first release have been addressed.\n\nLasting wounds no longer require in-town healers to fix. In the previous game, this was a well-intentioned incentive to play well, but typically turned into a money/time sync. It's gone. Good riddance.\n\nWhile the story still follows a relatively linear arc, the overworld map has many more nodes than before, representing land held by you and your opponent. If you and your armies can overtake these nodes, they unlock valuable bonuses and paths to new dungeons. Be warned, they can also be re-taken by your opponent, forcing you to re-take those nodes.\n\nThis allows a bit more variety than before. Instead of strictly puzzle-based handcrafted levels, you can now "grind" a little bit for XP and fun. This was sorely missed in the original game. It's not a complete solution, but alleviates a lot the pain.\n\nThe game has been simplified to make it more appealing to the less hardcore tabletop gamers. Skill trees are streamlined and some of the more cryptic stats have been brought in to the light.\n\nYou will also find levels that can be treated more as a tactical match instead of a puzzle whose trick needs to be figured out. In other words, the previous game had only one or two "correct" ways to finish a fight. This restriction has been loosened somewhat - although not to the degree that it should have.","January 21, 2015","true","23.7"," 21 of 46 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","21","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/celessia/recommended/314830/","celessia","⠀","http://steamcommunity.com/id/celessia/","745 products in account","Lets start by saying that this is a solid game, because it is. Would i recommend it? No.\n\nLets go over the whats and whys.\n\nThe inifial concept of the story struck me as something at least somewhat new and unique. Starting as a semi insane person is novelty in a way, if we forget Malkavians and the like. But it quickly slided down in terms of quality. The story is not entirely compelling and no matter what you do. You, ONCE AGAIN will never not in a million yeas get a good ending. Doesnt matter how good you are, doesnt matter how amazing was your decisionmaking or fighting. It just doesnt matter. The ending is set in stone,  you will die after 1 day of ruling, No matter what. Im ♥♥♥♥ing sick of every recent game in my memory doing that. It started with atrocious ending of ME3 and then it went on and on and on, - PC and NIiam dead in original Blackguards, tons of other games its like the new trademark: make endings spit you in the face. ♥♥♥♥ your efforts we want it to be remembered. And yes its understtandable from the story perspective and all but sersiously im sick of it.\n\nCharacter creation and advancement.\n\nStats were removed. And the system refined a bit, now you see what you pay for immediately. Its more user friendly, but i found that to me game lost a bit of charm with that decision, but dont get me wrong, i think its for the better. A lot of rebalancing, like the Witches Bile being nerfed aswell as some others, like the poison removal. No more wound persisting. Overall its way more user friendly.\n\nStory Discontinuity.\n\nThis is a small problem which will probably be adressed in the near future -> there are some minor bugs with how story progresses, namely in the beginning you are teleported from dwarf mansion into a conversation with a mage already without a mask. That is done on a few occasions buts its very minor.\n\nCharacters.\n\nWell if you liked Naurim, his best buddy mage and Takashi or whats his face then i got great news for you! Unfortunately you will not have a designated ranged weapon specialist unless you will specialise into it. Oh! But let me tell you, you will want to  have a few spells up your sleeve! Thats right, you can progress anything any time! No more restrictions! On the other hand you WILL be forced to take Heal on your main guy for some fights. Otherwise you cant win them or will have to lower difficulty. Literally no other way. (unless you are willing to burn through consumables like crazy)\n\nFights.\n\nFights were great in the original game, they are even better here. Extremely challenging just by sheer ammount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t some of them entail. How would you like to have 2 of your characters berzerking hitting everything that moves including friendlies, one envelopped in sand and immobile and last one trying to fidget with levers watching in terror as his teammates are torn to bits. Over and over and over and over. Or the neverending 2-4 mobs spawning every turn. Some fights are stupidly hard, some are ridiculously easy with double mage setup. Regardless the combat is way better then it was in the 1st game.\n\nBetter camera controlls aswell, - all issues of the old game were adressed. Somehow though im not happy with this one. By all rational thought process this IS a better game in every aspect. But i somehow just dont feel it. The best way to describe it would be imagine there is a great local singer and he is putting his heart and soul into his songs, they arent flawless, but he touches you, you love it its great. Then he is picked up by some big studio, he is given tons of recources,  concerts, videoclips, support, backstage dancers - everything. But in his eyes you do not see the fire of old. The soul of what made him great is gone. To those who see him 1st time he is just another 'good new singer' but for you he is nothing like what he was of old. Yes he looks better and sings better but its not him. Dissapointed you switch channel with a sigh.\n\nThis is how i feel about Blackguards 2. Its a good game, honestly. I d give it 7/10. But i would not recommend people to play it. Im sorry it just lacks the soul.","January 22, 2015","false","15.2"," 32 of 69 people (46%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","46","32","69","4","5"

I know there is an autosave, but I wished to do it manually. Also you cant change your equipment before a battle (if you forget to do so in the camp). If you chose one Hero for a battle where you could just take one, you cant switch afterwards, you can only reload.\nHave a look at your objectives for the battle you are fighting in atm? Nope.\n\n\nFor the Gameplay: Many spells are pretty useless. I use 90% the healing spell. Other spells would be cool, but need to much Astrapoints and keeping your heroes alive is always highest priority.\nYou always do the same damage (except you do a critical hit) - no dicerolls for damage. I know blackguards was fighting with problem, that there was too much random stuff, but always the same damage sucks.\nNo reroll: If you fail to spend your characterpoints carefully, you have to start a new game.\nAlso: No new heroes (so far and I read, there wont be any new heroes like those 3 companions you get at the start).\nTraps? Those you can carry are pretty senseless. You can only cary up to 4 items... setting traps cost too much time and arent very effective. Better you do damage directly.\nI got really a lot of one time useable items... too many! Most times I see no urgent reason to use them... thats why I sell it.\n\nBlackguards (1) never made me a big fan of those 3 characters and I was very disappointed to meet them again and all 3 were at "level 1" again. I understand why, but the story is like: they were super gladiators, best Cassia can get - esp. Takate who should be ♥♥♥♥ing overpowered according to the story, he won everything and now he just wants to die with honour - but they pretty suck.\n\nMany possibilites of builds, but in the end you only have your main character to play them. Wanna play Bow? Crossbow? Assassin? and so on... start a new game for every single build. (thou its possible to combine two "similar"  builds throu the game)\n\nMany builds sounds good at first, but its not as it seems: There arent really "special equipments" you have to collect, No dungeon crawling, most times you just buy the stuff. If you know what build you want to play, you dont have a big pool of choices to make your build special. Lots of HP, Stamina (or Mana), lot of Regeneration, lot of skills you simply need (its pretty clear, what skills you will have to want for your bowfigher for example). In the end you use always the same 3-5 special attacks.\n\nThe game is good, the strategy map is a new experience (thou looting and defending with your mercenaries gets much quicklier boring, than the main missions who are kinda different).\n\n\nSo these are ONLY negative points, but overall its good! Most of all I just miss the feeling of dungeon crawling which you have, when playing any RPG with Pen and Paper. I think the game wouldnt get boring over time - at the moment, playing it 2 or more times (to play another bulds) would kill me by boringness.","February 18, 2015","false","105.7"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

The graphics are well below par (even for a turn-based game), and the hex-field battleground causes very awkward gameplay. Although the turf-war element is fun to experience, the role-playing features of the game are completely uninspiring and feel like replicas of previous RPGs. No, I don’t think the game is a failure, as it is a decent follow up to the first Blackguards. But if you put this alongside other games of this genre, Blackguards 2 does not fare too well. http://www.noobfeed.com/reviews/1117/blackguards-2 Full Review","January 20, 2015","false","4.1"," 72 of 219 people (33%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","33","72","219","9","4"

Thats right this is not a strategy RPG.  Sure it has some basic elements of the genre but it is nothing more than a boring story that forces you to play as one of the most annoying characters I have ever seen.\n\nAfter an insufferable tutorial you are forced into clunky boring battles.  No choice no nothing.\n\nThe game is absolute abomination at its current price point.  It is not worth more than five dollars and that is a high price point.\n\n\nDo not be deceived as I was by the games "features" in it's discription.  This is not a strategy RPG that allows you to recruit a team and upgrade them how you see fit as you lay waste to your enemies.  No this is an adventure game with a very linear plot and choose your ending story.   Did I mention it has an insufferable forced tutorial that will put you to sleep while you struggle trying to figure out why in the world you can access your inventory in battle but not equip anything.\n\nOverall absolute trash of a game, do not buy.","January 20, 2015","false","0.9"," 81 of 257 people (32%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","32","81","257","14","7"

The gameplay is fun if you like turnbased combat.\nThe game scales a lot better and it's a bit easier to climb to power. It was an allright story and you wont have to play the previous game to know what is going on. You will however recognize people from the first game if you indeed played it.\n\n\nOld 'review' on launch:\n"Punishing and unfair, stuck at a level and little change from the first game."","January 25, 2015","true","30.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

You will be able to win eventually but it's usually not your tactics or play that leads you to win but rather the RNG eventually falling in your favor.  The first game was ok but I definitely would not recommend this one.","December 19, 2015","false","45.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the below exception.\n- The graphics are good for a game of its type.\n\nCons:\n- You can't speed up the movement of the troops and thus battles feel so sloooow as the characters trudge across the battlefield.  Overall, the slowness was too much for me to take and had to stop playing.  On the other hand, if you prefer a slow game with a lot of atmosphere then this would be a pro not a con!\n- Mouse selection of enemies is a bit off, once again slowing the game down because of several seconds spent each time you want to see the health of a particular enemy.","January 6","false","8.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
