"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/274270/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","NOT A HERO is a tactical shooter game developed by Roll7. The game was released on PC in May 2015. A PS4 version of the game was released in February 2016; unfortunately the PS Vita version was cancelled.\n\nGameplay in Not A Hero is focused quite heavily around cover based combat.  Each level you are given a main objective which you must complete in order to finish the stage, but there are also three optional objectives which you can do to raise your score. These optional objectives can often be done at the same time as the regular main mission, but some of them you have to go out of your way for.  Gameplay is done from a side scrolling view, and your character has a range weapon, but can also roll into enemies to knock them to the ground allowing you to execute them in one shot whilst they are stunned.  You unlock new characters depending on how high your score is, all of the different characters have their own unique model, style of combat move set. The missions can vary from simply clearing a stage out of enemies right the way to escorting your aunt through an enemy gang headquarters.  This game goes to the real extremes of the spectrum.\n\nThe graphics are the tried and testing pixel style, and whilst this form is becoming ever more popular, Not A Hero’s style just looks a lot cleaner and crisper than most pixel games.  The simplistic character sprites are all really carefully put together and you are really able to get a feel for how the character should act just from the visuals from these pixelated avatars.  Due to the game being based in UK, there are some absolutely brilliant stereotypical voice acting to be heard too; some of it had me in stiches with the accents and local slang being used.\n\nPlot wise, I absolutely loved Not A Hero, a purple rabbit called BunnyLord has come back in time to be elected as mayor to save your world from an alien invasion. You follow BunnyLord on his campaign trail to try and persuade the public to elect him by cleaning up crime in the city under his name. BunnyLord hires assassin’s to do his dirty work whilst he reaps the rewards, you are the assassin.\n\nThis game is really hard and extremely unforgiving. There are a number of enemies that can kill you in one hit, and there are often at times more than a handful of enemies shooting at you from down a corridor you can’t often see down. You have to make real use of all the cover you can and time your movement and shots perfectly without getting you’re self-covered in bullet holes. The game has taken me just over twenty hours to complete the story; and I have only barely completed it too. You are able to get a higher score by the end of the game by also completing the optional objectives each mission has.  The higher score you have, the more characters you can unlock.  The game’s only replay ability factor will only be worthwhile for people who are focused on these high scores, your average joe will more than likely be happy with the one play through of this game. I personally don’t see myself playing it any more than I already have.\n\nI only had one technical issue whilst playing; that was the game would not run in full screen mode. Whilst the game ran fine in windows mode, it was more of an annoyance that I couldn’t run it. I would strongly recommend anyone playing this game to use a controller though, the platforming nature and controls layout really gives you the advantage on a controller over a keyboard.\n\nTo sum up, NOT A HERO is a really good game. Whilst the game play ideas aren’t as original as I would have hoped, the rest of the production values are all very high quality. Fantastic voice acting and visually pleasing art style does this game massive favours. The comical value also holds massive positives for this release as well. This game would be even better if there was a local co-op mode included as it is a perfect format for it.  The price point of £9,99 is really fair given the amount of content to get through as well. I would strongly recommend Not A Hero\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mickyjayuk/recommended/274270/","mickyjayuk","Micky Jay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mickyjayuk/","265 products in account","Taking a break from skateboarding madness, OlliOlli series creators Roll7 have unleashed something new on the gaming world. With a premise which includes time-travel, British politics and an anthropomorphic purple rabbit, welcome to the world of Not a Hero.\n\nThe cover-based indie shooter takes place during a mayoral election where BunnyLord, the aforementioned rabbit, has travelled back in time from 2048 to save the world from total destruction and alien invasion. In a bid to become mayor he hires Steve, a professional assassin turned amateur campaign manager, to clean up the city by any means necessary.\n\nWith the help of similarly dubious “heroes”, Steve must utilise their unique skill sets and complete his mission, ensure BunnyLord is elected mayor and save the future of the world, so no pressure on Steve then.\n\nNot a Hero‘s story is, quite frankly, insane, but in the best way possible. The narrative is intelligent, witty, incredibly funny and at no stage during your campaign run does it get boring. It tells the tale of a bunny man from the future on a quest to take Boris Johnson’s job in order to save the human race, what is not to love about that?\n\nThis bizarre tale plays out in-game through “BunnyLord’s Briefing Room” meetings prior to each level, followed by a post-carnage one to one in the local cafe when the mission is complete. It’s told extremely well with a dialog that you’ll find it hard pressed to make it through without the occasional laugh out loud moment.\n\nThe gameplay itself is extremely enjoyable, from the very beginning of the game when Steve is a lone warrior with his handgun, through to the conclusion of the story where nine different heroes are at your disposal, the game never drops in quality. Much like Roll7’s OlliOlli, the control layout is perfect, the mechanics are simple to master and so the game quickly becomes more about tactics and less about what buttons to press.\n\nThis intuitive control setup lets you quickly jump into the game and utilize everything on offer. The mixture of rampage and cover-based shootouts mean that sometimes it’s perfectly acceptable to go crazy while other times you’ll need a little tact. You have at your disposal a primary weapon, a collectible secondary weapon – grenades, turrets, that sort of thing – the ability to slide and knock enemies over as well as dodge and cover, all of which makes the gameplay exceptionally versatile.\n\nOne of the greatest design decisions in Not a Hero is the mass quantities of ammo, you do not need to go seeking a resupply mid-carnage, just simply reload. At the end of the day, this game isn’t going for total realism in any way and so taking away the distraction of finding ammo is a superb move which leaves you more time to mutilate your enemies.\n\nAnother interesting element is the dynamic mission risks, unexpected mid-level events that can beef up the difficulty considerably just when you think you’ve completed your mission with ease. These may be in the form of S.W.A.T. teams, trigger happy seniors, helicopter gunships, the occasional panda, or even a suicidal samurais. This accompanied by the fact that each level plays out slightly different depending on the character you play as means that yet again Roll7 have mastered the art of replayability.\n\nThe cast of characters themselves, while all controlled the same way, each have their own unique personalities, weapons and weaknesses. Cletus, for example, is a shotgun-toting hillbilly type who pretends to be Scottish. He will require a lot more reloads then Steve and given the time it takes to reload a weapon, this can be a significant problem when you’ve got a S.W.A.T. team closing in. That said he does have the ability to shoot open doors, which will definitely work in your favour.\n\nSamantha, on the other hand, is a Welsh warrior, fast and agile, she is able to shoot while running and execute bad guys in a flash. As you progress through the game, the personalities and diverse skill sets increase significantly. Once you’ve unlocked them all, you’ll be able to smash bad guys to shreds with the hammer of Ronald, or slice your way through the crowd with Kimmy.\n\nIt’s not just the way the cast plays that is unique though, the voice-over work is hilarious, if a little bit adult-only. Our main hero Steve, for example, sounds like he belongs in a Guy Richie movie while Samantha wouldn’t look out of place in a twisted version of Gavin and Stacey. No word of a lie, this is some of the best voice-over work for an indie game I’ve ever had the pleasure of hearing despite the limited vocabulary.\n\nMuch like the OlliOlli series, Not a Hero is visually pleasing with a great deal work put into turning what could easily have been a bland simplistic environment into a colourful vibrant one. Roll7 have gone above and beyond in making this game look good. The animation in each of the characters fighting styles, the unique look of every character, good or bad, even the smooth flow of the gameplay, it’s all done to the highest standard.\n\nIn addition to the voice-over work which I’ve already praised, the soundtrack is brilliant. From the casual elevator music on the character select screen to the in-level fast pumping, ready for action music, it’s fit for purpose, adds to the overall experience and just works perfectly. Roll7 do of course have a reputation for awesome soundtracks as anyone that has played one of the OlliOlli games will agree.\n\nOverall, I honestly can’t find a significant flaw with Not a Hero, it is a superb game. While the graphics may initially seem primitive, Roll7 have used their brilliant design skills to make every pixel count on screen. The cast of character is as diverse as it is extensive and the dynamic mission surprises mean that you’re never likely to get the same experience twice.\n\nThe story is a laugh to say the least and the gameplay is flawless, an all round great game. Long live the BunnyLord.","May 14, 2015","true","3.7"," 98 of 110 people (89%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","89","98","110","13","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/recommended/274270/","Azba","Azba","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azba/","663 products in account","Preface: Notice my playtime. I have not finished the game yet, so this is based on my initial impressions. I will amend if need be later.\n\nIt would not be an unfair comparison to compare this game to Hotline Miami. It is similar in that it can be extremely fast paced and relies almost entirely on your skill and reaction times than anything else, yet it differs simply because a single mistake can be forgiven. Retries are also common per level, particularly if you are going for 100%.\nThe gameplay itself is very solid and each level has a set of challenges which are in fact challenging - something many games these days fail to offer. At its core I would say it is basically hotline miami as a cover shooter with optional cover and some leniency with getting hit.\nIt is very fun, and earns a solid A+ in the fun department, however I must say the game's sense of humor is what I would call "borderlands tier" - that is to say if you liked borderlands' sense of humor you will love this game's sense of humor, and if you did not you will seathe with hatred every time BunnyLord opens his mouth.\n\nPros:\n*Fast paced, hectic cover shooter gameplay\n*Relies mostly on reaction speed, skill, and planning to do well\n*Along with the above, skillful or perhaps cuhrayzee play is rewarded accordingly and allows you to progress much faster than treating the game like a cover shooter with optional objectives\n*Excellent sound direction and music\n*Nice pixel graphics and animations, simple as they are\n*Good variety of characters who all feel, act, and play differently - no one is a direct upgrade to anyone else, and no one is awful\n*Good variety of challenges per level which are actually challenging and introduce replay value\n*Power-ups are actually very useful and feel powerful!\n*Unlike Hotline Miami, the game features more than just "go here and clear out all the dudes" as a map objective\n*Fairly clever level design, with a lot of cheekiness evident you won't notice until it's too late\n*Escort missions aren't horrible exercises in patience!\n*The voice acting is pretty damn good, way better than expected\n\nContentions:\n*"Borderlands tier" sense of humor. That is to say the game's sense of humor revolves around what I'd describe as "lolsorandom", references to pop culture, and memes. If you like that, you'll love it. If not, you'll hate it.\n*The enemies are kinda dumb and predictable. While this can be good for planning an optimal route and playstyle, it detracts from keeping the game interesting as they will always act the same and can be defeated via the same tactics every time\n\nCons:\n*If you don't like the game's sense of humor you're going to be aggravated the whole way through\n*The game can fall into "distract 'em up" territory when there are numerous enemies present in a single area. That is to say it becomes too difficult to tell what is going on and how to react with so many bullets and debris flying around\n*Making contact or even getting near an enemy results in immediate knockback with no windup on the enemy's part. This can also pass through slides or other actions, and is EXTREMELY irritating especially in levels where enemies can throw you off ledges away from missable objectives or to your death. IMO enemies should exibit some sort of windup to give you a chance to react, even if that chance is tiny.\n*Player HP is very forgiving. For a good part of the game you could simply sit uncovered in a hallway and spam the fire key until everything is dead. I think the game would benefit from a "Hotline Miami mode" in which 1 hit equals death on both sides - though I haven't finished the game yet so I don't know if this is already a feature.\n\nFinal Comments:\nI would definitely recommend this game on sale. Despite the fact the game's sense of humor did not stick with me, I found the gameplay extremely fun with mostly small annoyances. Would absolutely recommend if you can find it bundled or cheaper than its retail price.","July 17, 2015","true","0.7"," 89 of 120 people (74%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","74","89","120","7","3"

Specifically, Not a Hero is a pixelated shooter in the same vein as BroForce, replacing the jump button for a slide button and allowing your characters to hide behind the environment rather than blowing it all up to kingdom come. As such, you trade the visceral excitement of being super-Rambo extraordinaire in favor of a more intellectual approach to taking out a tenement full of skeezy lowlives.\n\nIt's funny how this game truly captures the essence of Call of Duty "shoot and cover" gameplay in a minimalist 8-bit package. Your slide button slips you into cover but also brings a certain factor of CQC into the mix, allowing executions on enemies reloading from cover. The graphics are dirt simple but it's the same gameplay principles as next-gen shooters, and that alone makes for a subtly enriching experience.\n\nI really wish this game had better rewards. I've just completed level 13 War on Drugs with all challenges using... Clive. Clive is a reward character unlocked by completing all previous levels with all challenges, so he should be mega-badass, right? Wrong. I spent more than two hours on that stage and only managed to succeed thanks to some opportune weapon drops. There's a dearth of design space in this game, and the plethora of playable characters doesn't hide the fact that there's limited ways to play. There's only three buttons to this game in the first place, all the characters and the rewards only feel like a distraction!\n\nI feel like this game went largely unnoticed because it doesn't have the camp and explosiveness of its immediate competitor and that this is to the gaming world's detriment. I blame marketing, mostly. The store page is rather misleading, with all the story elements glossing over the true nature of your purpose. The title explicitly states you are Not A Hero but no one ever tells you what you are. Turns out you are just as much of a deranged murdering psychopath as your enemies; basically the same as the protagonists from BroForce. In effect, Not A Hero is essentially funny accents over funny explosions. A puzzle game with guns. You end up blasting just as many hadjis as in that other game so no point being so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cryptic about it! Just say what your game is about and people will appreciate the superior gameplay of your product and maybe even savor the minimalist duck and shoot experience.\n\nADDENDUM: Play with a gamepad, keyboard controls are unusable.\n\nREVIEW EDITED FOR SIZE","September 18, 2015","true","19.2"," 35 of 38 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","35","38","5","16"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/recommended/274270/","alexngregory","alex.n.gregory","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alexngregory/","3023 products in account","There's a lot to be said for Not a Hero, the most recent (as of this writing) game by Roll7 and Devolver Digital that puts players in the shoes of a group of people working to clean up crime on behalf of an anthropomorphic rabbit named BunnyLord.\n\nI was part of the beta testing team for this game, and the first thing that stood out to me was how polished the game is. This is a gorgeous game that feels like the offspring between Broforce, Super Meat Boy and Hotline Miami. The controls are incredibly responsive, there were no apparent bugs that I caught (although there are a couple ways to exploit movement speed and the dive mechanics) and the death animations were equal parts amusing and brutal.\n\nThe game takes place in the three weeks leading up to the U.K.'s mayoral elections, and the first character, Steve, is chosen by BunnyLord to hunt down and destroy various criminal elements in order to up their approval rating and win the ballot. As time goes on and the player's rating rises, BunnyLord brings in new staffers to help out on missions, including a shotgun-toting redneck, a slovenly man with an afro and gay Jesus. Not making this up.\n\nEach character has their own pros and cons - while Steve is the everyman character with no major advantages or disadvantages, others have different skill sets. Samantha is a Welsh alcoholic who speaks in an exaggerated accent and moves very quickly but has poor accuracy. Jesus runs fast but can't shoot straight while moving. Mike has a powerful shotgun and can do quick executions, but only gets two shots per reload.\n\nA lot of the levels throughout the game favor specific characters. In fact, the time-based challenges are nigh-impossible to complete using the same character - you'll have to mix it up in order to complete the stages, which are graded based on how many of the objectives are completed at once.\n\nThere's a few interesting concepts I liked about the game. The post-mission chat with BunnyLord changes depending on which character you've picked, how many of the objectives you completed and how much damage you took during the mission. Likewise, there are some extremely amusing level objectives - the one where you escort BunnyLord's aunt, Ruby, back to her apartment is hilarious - her nonstop chatter is mixed in with the soundtrack, and she proves to be just as capable with a weapon as the other characters are. That said, the humor can come off as forced at times, and I never really felt there was a need to listen to the pre-mission briefings.\n\nIf there's one real negative I have about the game, it's that the later stages devolve from a sort of freeflow experience (where you can either rush through levels for speed or take your time and pick off enemies one-by-one) to complete trial-and-error. The last five levels are filled with samurai and enemies who will kill you in one hit, and it is extremely frustrating to go all the way through a level, get within distance of the exit and suddenly get impaled through the chest by an enemy who can run much faster than you.\n\nHaving finished it, I don't think the game gives much incentive to go back and replay levels for 100% completion. I was just fine steamrolling through the game, and although the ending seems to guilt-trip the player into going back and doing all the optional stuff, I just didn't care enough to replay it.\n\nI would still recommend Not A Hero to anyone looking for a solid, polished 2D shooter, and I enjoyed the experience.","May 18, 2015","true","5.2"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

The graphics style may be pixelated and simple, but they are so comical and always fit the scenario. The visuals are appealing and full of humour. The antihero Bunnylord explains us, who to kill...while having a spear through his head. He calls it headwear. But don't forget, this guy also uses crayons to paint his posters. Humor and artstyle all perfect but this is not the main part of the game. The gameplay is spot on. It is fast and it is so fun. You can slide, you can go in cover and the cool thing is - your skill improves. You get faster and with each level you feel more and more ruthless. And you know what? You are. The sound may be simple, but it doesn't feel misplaced. An elevator jingle after a rampage? Why not. I highly recommend this game to any person interested in a Hotline Miami-ish game experience. It is not easy but I really wouldn't call it hard, if you are familiar with videogames in general.\n\nEDIT: I am now through it, took me almost 5 hours. I could 100% it...but I won't, at least in the near future. I really enjoyed the game and especially the style and humour. Games aren't often that funny and solid in execution and I really hope that we get some more Bunnylord, but with a bit more refined gameplay and gamedesign, even though I really like the gameplay. But sometimes it is kind of unfair...especially the last 2 levels were a TOTAL pain the butt, the last one the most. Maybe I just wanted to complete the game and help Bunnylord to become a mayor, but still - I would rather have it skipped or altered. Anyway, I do recommend the game to anyone who enjoys some great gameplay, nice pixel art and of course the really clever and funny writing - both dialogoue, story and the characters. You may want to get it on sale, if you don't plan on 100% completing it. It is "only" 5 hours afterall and I didn't really think it was that repetetive, but I didn't play it in one sitting...more like 3-5.","April 19","true","4.9"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

While Not A Hero is fun for an hour or two, it quickly gets incredibly repetitive. It all comes down to this; after the novelty of the cool concept goes away, this game gets incredibly boring.\nMuch like in Hotline Miami (which shares the same publisher as Not A Hero), you'll constantly be dying and restarting in this game. This is the games biggest flaw. Unlike in Hotline Miami, I never felt motivated to continue. The gameplay itself is slow, save for the first few levels. You and your enemies can take multiple hits, which makes the game impossible to speed through like you would in HM. Because of that, I never felt that rush to jump right into another try. I just felt so...bleh. After 2 hours, i felt like I was doing the same levels over and over again with no variety. I also never felt satisfied with my deaths. In HM, I always feel like my deaths were fair and occured because I made a mistake. However, in NAH, I felt like all of my deaths were the game's fault, not mine. The cover system, which is the main selling point of this game, just feels unfinished. I'll tap the buttin to go into cover, only to stop a litltle short, which I won't realize until an enemy fills me with bullets.\nThe game tries to create some variety by giving you different characters to play as, but about halfway through the game, you're almost required to use one of the shotgun characters, Cletus or Mike, in order to take out the late game bullet sponges. This game also really could have benefitted from some good music. Instead, you get to listen to one of the most bland soundtracks of all time.\nI applaud Roll7 for trying to make you unique game, but Not A Hero just gets too repetitive and boring. If a sequel is ever made with faster, twitch gameplay and more variety, I'll be first in line to get it, but for now, I'd stay away from this game.","September 16, 2015","false","6.8"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","44","67","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/messofanego/recommended/274270/","messofanego","Messofanego","http://steamcommunity.com/id/messofanego/","259 products in account","A positively British game in the most vulgar of ways. Full of character, figuratively and literally. I want to make comparisons to Quentin Tarantino or Guy Ritchie but I feel this is less indulgent about the style and just wants to have confident fun about it all. The developers at Roll 7 know exactly what they wanted to do, there are no muddled messages here. Even if you're doing horrible things in the name of electing a mayor, it's all done in an endearing juvenile manner. Great music, aesthetic, colour palette, gameplay, ultraviolence, 80s nostalgia, character animations, and attitude. From the various playable characters with their own accents/memorable quotes/gameplay style, to the endearingly satirical approach to politics by just smashing crime in its horrendous face.\n\nBunnyLord has come back from the future and tried multiple ways to fix the world but in the end, the only effective solution is such a juvenile one to kill all the "bad guys" and elect him as mayor (or even Global Megalord). You play an anti-hero or in BunnyLord's exceedingly randomised and memorably hilarious words, "an amazeballs pigeon-hero of crime-fighting justice", as part of a growing cast of characters in BunnyLord's Fun Club during the 21 days before his election. You have to clean up three districts with their own colour palette, aesthetic, and crime boss. The game is full of little touches that gives the game a lot of personality that you won't find in most shooters. BunnyLord's debriefings and post-mission dialogue can be a bit long, but there's love and care for details like hanging out at Aunt Ruby's for milkshakes which bring happiness no matter what even if they sometimes contain a bit of frog, or having fun with crayons. Each time, BunnyLord's adjectives or nouns might change, even down to different things to collect in a level. Sometimes, your face might come out bruised after a mission. Even if you don't care for a character, hearing all their region-specific dialogue during levels and on the character select screen is a treat. Whether they're a cockney lad (Steve), a Welsh run-and-gun lady (Samantha), a Scottish not-hillbilly (Cletus), a posh John Woo dual-pistol suit-wearing smoker (Clive reloads with a smoke), a black SMG wielder who stores ammo and his knife in an afro (Stanley), or a cutesy looking sword gal who swears constantly and can shoot while executing. After many of the levels, the dark humour is apparent when maybe the people you killed was a mistake but how glib about it all BunnyLord is sells the carefree attitude that's present throughout the game.\n\nWhile it might bear similarity to games like Hotline Miami, Elevator Action, Blackthorne, or Gunpoint in certain elements (an arcade-ish skillful 2D shooter with vertical level design), how it plays when combined feels like its own thing. Sliding, getting into cover, slide tackling, executing, slashing, goring, all feel satisfying thanks to very snappy controls. In very few instances, when sliding and falling down below (day 18 specifically), the cover magnetism can go against you and end up falling right into a samurai's blade. It all feels intuitive and is a blast to get good at so you can master the levels by obtaining the Global Megalord rank on each level. Each level will have side objectives which are challenges, and many of the levels can be quite tricky. There is nuance to the level design in each of them that you'll want to familiarise yourself with to get the GM rank. Sometimes, it's just a case of unlocking the right character, but mostly it's down to trial-and-error, memorisation, and muscle memory, which makes for a lot of replayability. It's not a case of just one character being best for one level, as the characters I have chosen to GM certain levels have been different from others' experiences. Clive's bi-directional special shooting might be great for levels where enemies come at you from both sides. Mike (a functioning alcoholic) might be great if you want to use less bullets and stab everyone silently. Jesus (the sexy spanish hip-thrusting kind) is great for timed challenges because he can move while executing in a spin dance.\n\nSpeeding through these levels while sliding around, melee executing, shooting from cover, and utilising the powerups at the right times turns the game into a badass simulator. The bosses are not usually straight up bosses with long health bars but rather dictated by the level design. The ending of each of these boss encounters, animation-wise, is an absolute brutal treat. It took me 20 hours to get the GM rating on every level. The replayability is incentivized even more by having 4 possible endings (Mayor, Prime Minister, King, Global Megalord) with their own end screen and an epilogue exchange with a certain special character. Each of the endings are hilarious in their own way, so don't fret about getting the "good" ending although the Global Megalord epilogue is worth the hard work.\n\nIt's an awesome game throughout, full of personality, and one of my favourite games of 2015 so far. Go tickle some criminals in the teeth.\n\nMade a playlist for my playthrough of GM'ing the levels: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4fyeE7-K5BnJzpw_rsemZhN19tKhsxRr","May 20, 2015","true","20.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","1"

Want to know why I gave it a thumbs down? The boredom. Each level seems to be a copy and paste scene with copy and pasted characters from previous levels. The limited controls and bizarre keybinds puzzled me, because through options you couldn't change the arrow keys to i don't know... the WASD keys AND you couldn't change the shoot, roll, and special weapon keys either. You'll find yourself about 30 minutes into the game wondering why you bought the game when you realize that there is nothing unique in the upcoming levels and that the Bunny's little speeches before levels don't benefit you whatsoever.\n\nOverall, a nice concept and story line but bad execution made me very down on this game.\nWorth $12?

There's a few problems:\nLack of content\nSamey\nControlsFirst off: lack of content. There's not a lot to do, and the gameplay, while fun at first, gets rather old in a short amount of time. You unlock characters as you complete more objectives in levels (approval rating) and once you unlock a few characters there's no reason to use any of the others ever again. Mike is by far one of the best characters, and it's really odd that they'd have so many characters and make two of them a lot better than the rest. This game isn't difficult, and most of the difficulty I would say is a battle against the controls, so the content's duration is "padded" with a little bit of frustration. More on that later.\n\nThe content that is there is somewhat... repetitive. There are three zones with 7 levels and some secret levels. Different zones have different enemies and themes. but only the enemies are really at all different, some marginally so. It took me about 5.5 hours to complete everything in the game, including achievements. Honestly, if you don't go for all the objectives, it'd probably take you around 1 or 2 hours. I think the asking price is a little high for this amount of content. A full completion would take less time if it wasn't for the next issue.\n\nThe controls are pretty bad, especially on keyboard. The analog stick control is terrible, and I ended up using my Steam controller to try to compensate for it (the default controls are... mushy). Maybe it's better with an Xbox/PS controller dpad, but I can't imagine it would be. There's a button to reload, for special weapons, shooting and dodging/cover. I REALLY wish cover/dodge were on separate buttons, as most of the issues I had with completing challenges was because of context issues; sometime's I'd be rolling when I wanted to take cover, sometimes I'd take cover when I needed to roll. It's also worth mentioning that you can't rebind keyboard controls, so gamepad is the way to go.\n\nHonestly, this game isn't "bad", but it's not something I'd recommend that you "must play". In fact, most people could skip this game. The premise is interesting, but the execution just sort of fizzles out by the end. I think that if controls were tighter, if there were more actions or some sort of weapon system, or if there were bosses or something it would be more interesting. I'd wait until it's 3-5 bucks.","April 20","true","5.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","2"

The game is full of violence and racially insensitive stereotypes, so if you're a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like me, you'll get a kick out of this game's unique energy and somewhat sadistic humor.\n\nAs far as the storyline goes, I was more invested in the politics in this game than in the current US election. I'd like to think that BunnyLord is a hyperbolic, hopped-up (pun intended), lagomorphic Trump parody with a "hands-on" approach to stopping crime.\n\nI loved all the playable characters, if not only for their quirky personalities, but as the game progressed, I found myself neglecting some of the ones unlocked early on in favor for the later characters. Clive and Mike are just simply superior to Samantha and Cletus for most levels. If you go for all the side goals in each mission, you'll unlock better characters incredibly quickly, rendering the rest of the game a breeze. If this game gets a sequel, I'd love to see stages or challenges later on that are better suited for some of the starter characters.\n\nAll in all, I highly recoomend this game and I'm savoring my milkshake, waiting for someone to sign a sequel. #BunnyLord2016","May 2","true","9.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","12","14","2","0"

I am a fan of retro platforming games so when i saw this game i wanted it right away. For the graphic style this game has it looks really good and the shooting is flashy and satisfying. There is a decent amount of written dialogue before and after missions so if that's your thing then you're in luck. Me personally i just keep on skipping it so i can move along to the next mission. This game is very straight forward so if you get bored easily of doing the same thing over and over again then maybe you shouldn't buy this game. And there lies my only issue with this game is that it lacks content and if they had added more stuff (Weapons, moves, guns, co-op etc) this game could have gone from great to amazing. Like i said there is plenty of reading to do between missions but that will not satisfy everyone and it might annoy others.\n\nThere are some things i wish this game had that they have not added, this is not a con at all but more of a few ideas that i think could have made the game a fuller experience. The main thing that would have been great would be character progression. Like an RPG style leveling system where after each level you get a little stronger, faster etc. Also equippable equipment that you find throughout the levels or buy from a shop in between stages. I have not seen anything like this in the game so far which is slightly disappointing because i believe that could have made this game even better than it currently is.\n\nI will have to come back later after playing the game some more and update some stuff but as of right now the bottom line is this. The game is fun, it's not too expensive, shooting/killing is satisfying and if you're into these type of indie games there is no way you won't enjoy this. If they held the game off for a while and added some RPG elements to the game i think it could have been amazing but it's damn good just the way it is. That is just my personal opinion and i'm sure you might feel another way about it and that's fine just don't bash me for having my own take on things.\n\nIf i had to rate this game at this very moment i would give it an 7/10.

That's part of the difficulty, which is fine, but it leads me to my next issue;\n-The controls: My biggest issue. It's just awkward to play on a keyboard and you can't remap key-bindings to something comfortable. I had to play on a controller and remap to something I liked and it still felt clunky.\nReload is tough to keep track of with fast enemies that only advance when you reload.\nSliding feels ok, until it slows down, but still feels a little wonky to do.\nI couldn't remap "shoot" to a trigger on my 360 pad, so I have to use the shoulder buttons.\n-There's no way of knowing how much health an enemy has left, and some of them are real bullet sponges\n-Your health audio for when you're two "bars" away from death and one bullet away from death is that same.\n-Death: It just feels punishing. You usually don't actually know what ultimately killed you unless it's a one-on-one fight.\n-Dialog: It's well written and funny, but it's TOO SLOW. It goes past comedic timing and enters exhausting when it's pushing two sentences every 25 seconds and there is a paragraph of stuff to move through. I usually hit the 75% mark and skipped the rest just to get back to the game, and skipped almost all the post-level stuff because of this.\n\nAll this said, I like the game.

There are a lot of small little things in the mechanics that go against the flow of the game (like getting knocked back if you make contact with an enemy) and a lot of the unlockable characters just come off as useless. There is one level that reaches greatness, giving you a big map with multiple avenues to get your objectives done but it's short lived as all the levels afterward get frustratingly linear by comparison. In fact the last zone pretty much pigeon holes you into sticking with the shotgun guy once it introduces katana wielding enemies that instantly kill you.\n\nAlso, the pixel/8 bit graphics are grating my ♥♥♥♥ing nerves on end. It's something I've been sick of in the indy scene the last few years (even for games I like) and comes of a lot of the time as a get out of jail free card excuse for creators who don't have the capacity of animating or drawing something more complex than a block. Oh, and I forgot to mention that the "humor" starts off OK but gets annoying.

If you've ever played Canablat, you know the joy of crashing through a window in the side of a building, and NOT A HERO has that sensation in spades. The slide functions well, and working it into the cover mechanics is smooth as butter. The gunplay is simple, but effective. Each character has different running and firing speeds, but all work on the same principals. Every level is sliding on the ground to shatter some poor fool's kneecaps, plugging a bullet into his head, and slipping into cover to throw a molotov at the heavy with a machine gun who just caught up with you. Tense, but twitchy and fun.\n\nThe problems are minor, but worth noting. Bunnylord's voice is funny for two minutes and then annoying for two hours, and his text crawls extremely slow. I spent more time listening to him talk before and after the mission than I did shooting dudes for the first couple levels. Most of his dialogue is repetitive and can be skipped, and while it too is pretty funny for a while, by the time I'd beaten Upgraydd it was a serious case of "yeah I get it." Having no way to re-access hidden levels once you find them other than going to the original stage again is also a bummer, and (while it made me laugh in the trailer) lacking options like a windowed mode isn't great.\n\nThese are, however, total nitpicks. The level-to-level game here is solid, and while I haven't finished it quite yet, I know I'm going to. This is for sure a cool game to keep an eye on, and I'm very much enjoying my time with it.","May 16, 2015","true","7.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It is a very cool retro themed indie game. Play it with a controller like I do for the best experience (xbox 360 controller here). I never thought I would see a cover based mechanic in a 2D shooter but here it is and it works great. The missions are a blast even on repeated tries to get all the achievements. The characters are pretty diverse and fun, but the shotgun guy seems to get me killed a lot because he runs out of ammo quickly and it takes too long to reload. I prefer the first guy or the run and gun chick. The story is funny and adds to the gameplay in giving you a purpose for all the killing. The graphics and effects are awesome, better than most indie games. The sound is great and the music is pretty good too. The game controls great and has a good flow to it. Overall it is one of my favorite indie games ever, very well done overall. One of the few times I can say a game is well worth its full asking price. It's a pretty violent game and has some fun items such as different ammo and bomb types including a turret you can place. You get to run and blow dudes away, dive through windows, rescue people, burn down marijuana plants, and kill more dudes violently. Probably the best depiction of a action movie in a 2D shooter ever.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/recommended/274270/","FlamesSuperior","UpInFlames","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlamesSuperior/","263 products in account","Would a purple homicidal anthropomorphic rabbit from the future be a better ruler than the real ones we have today? Sadly, the answer is: quite possibly. And that’s exactly the premise of Not a Hero from London-based developer Roll7 that already made a name for itself with the acclaimed side-scrolling skateboarding game OlliOlli. The idea presented by BunnyLord is that, for some reason, the world will end unless he gets elected mayor. The polls aren’t in BunnyLord’s favor and apparently the best way to turn voter opinion around is to assemble a crew of misfits who will brutally and mercilessly poke crime in its ugly face. Well, we’ve certainly seen worse election campaigns.\n\nThe story is about as preposterous as it sounds. BunnyLord is obsessed with milkshakes, turtles, pandas and murder (oh, and cheese) and will send the player to perform a wide range of tasks through the territory of three stereotypical gangs. However, all of these tasks basically boil down to killing everyone in your path. It’s a good thing then that killing in this game is really well done. Not a Hero is a 2D side-scrolling cover-based shooter on two planes with the second plane acting as cover. It’s an instantly intuitive system as both you and your enemies are slightly shaded upon entering cover. There’s no jumping in the game, but sliding serves as a substitute mechanic and it is pulled off brilliantly. Basically, you can slide to move faster and also to tackle enemies which enables you to execute them point blank. However, there are enemies that cannot be tackled and they have to be avoided and shot from a distance.\n\nThe first character you have at your disposal is BunnyLord’s best friend Steve, but as you go through missions and increase BunnyLord’s standing in the polls, more characters will join your cause. Every character has a distinct amusing personality and it is obvious that this is a very British game. I never got tired of hearing Steve shout “♥♥♥♥in’ ‘ell” as he encountered droves of enemies. Then there’s Cletus (“Dressed like a hillbilly, but actually from Scotland”), Samantha from Wales (“Valley girls last longer!”), Jesus from Spain who has formidable hip-thrusting skills and my favorite, Mike from Northern England with a constant eye twitch most likely indicating a murderous sociopath. There are nine characters in total to unlock and more importantly than their personality, each of them has different skills, weapons and abilities which completely changes the way you go through a level. For example, Steve’s specialty is tackling, Mike performs silent executions, Stanley has high rate of fire good for crowd control whereas Jesus is a really fast runner and performs executions while moving.\n\nThe map design is good, but rather straightforward. Each level offers some additional objectives that occasionally take you away from the main route, but most of the time there’s just one way to go through a level. Apart from a helicopter encounter, there aren’t any setpieces to mix things up a bit and offer a bit of diversity. Even during the three boss fights, you’re more of a bystander taking care of other enemies while BunnyLord takes care of the boss. The game does throw you in the fire a bit with enemies popping up unexpectedly most notably when the SWAT teams enter the building and start chasing you down. Enemies also drop various power ups for your weapon and secondary weapons such as grenades or turrets are also scattered through each level.\n\nThe game uses pixel art for its graphics and while it’s pleasant, the art style isn’t particularly strong. The same can be said for the soundtrack which uses retro 8-bit music. The goal was obviously going for a retro feel in a more modern package, but neither component really stands out. The controls and the mechanics are tight and responsive. The game runs well for the most part, although I did experience some slowdown in certain places. It’s not anything major, but it is noticeable due to the nature of the game which requires pinpoint precision and speed. There’s a bit of trial and error as the game demands you to memorize the level layout and enemies and then perform really well in order to get to the end because you have to start over from the beginning each time you die. This does get just a bit frustrating, however, the mechanics are so well implemented that you’ll definitely want to jump back in and finish the level. It has that addictive element to it and once you master it, the sense of accomplishment is great indeed.\n\nThe game’s biggest drawback is its short length and lack of longevity. Once you finish up the 21 levels in the game all of which are very short, there’s little incentive to go on. You can go through levels with different characters to get better results, but it’s not that compelling. It’s a shame that the game doesn’t support Steam achievements as those would possibly facilitate more gameplay experimentation and provide more incentive to re-visit a level, if wisely implemented. I also have one gripe regarding the story. The premise is great, but the game doesn’t really take it anywhere. Sure, there are a lot of jokes here, but a more engaging political satire, which is actually hinted at in the trailers and the advertising but which is not in the actual game, would go a long way to make this game not only more current and relevant, but also more humorous. Based on the pre-release campaign, I expected something like a gaming equivalent of a cross between the senseless slapstick violence of Bottom and the edgy political satire of The New Statesman. Which would have been brilliant. As it is, though, Not a Hero is only half way there in that regard.\n\nNot a Hero is a very enjoyable game thanks to its tight mechanics, exhilarating gameplay and humorous story. There’s definitely room for improvement and seeing as how the ending leaves the door wide open for a sequel, it will be very interesting to see what Roll7 does next as the foundation laid here is strong indeed.\n\n7 OUT OF 10 (VERY GOOD)","May 26, 2015","true","5.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Maybe they were patched as soon as the game released or I’m just lucky. The game does have that Hotline Miami “quick restart” feel to it if you ask me. After playing for about 2 hours I figured out that you can pause right when the death animation starts. This means that you can pause and restart quickly. Sadly the loading screen takes a bit but it shaves off a second or four.\n\nThe game has a really nice flow to it and you can instantly see that some levels are designed to be played with a certain character. Sometimes this is because you have to get to a payphone in time which would be impossible if you’re not playing as Jesus or Mike or because there are hordes of enemies that require less finesse. The flow that results from nailing combos at a high rate feels amazing. The game promotes you gaining a flow like that by doing little things like allowing you to execute two enemies at once, or not penalizing you speed-wise for getting damage.\n\nThe thing that annoys me about this game though is that a lot of the levels depend on you getting a certain ammo power up in the beginning of the level. A great example of this is when you have to fight the boss Upgraydd. To get to the payphone you have to go through two “heavy” enemies. This means that you have to pause and pump a lot of bullets into them. This takes a lot of time and you won’t be to reach the pay phone in time unless you get a power up that kills enemies in a single shot such as the drill bullets.\n\nThe game is awesome though and it’s a good example of what a game with a great combo flow looks like.","May 14, 2015","true","12.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

Great soundtrack\n2. Lovable characters\n3. Rather fun & fast-paced gameplay, but be warned; expect to die A LOT while playing this game.\n4. Beautiful pixel art (especially for me, because I love pixel games)\n\nThe story is that you are a professional assassin hired by a politician from the future named Bunnylord, who is running for office, to get the people to vote for him. "How is an assassin going to do that?", you might think. Simple, really. Bunnylord gives you the task TO FALCON PUNCH CRIME IN ITS DEPRESSING DONG, because people hate crime, and if you show the public that you are shooting crime in the face, why wouldn't they vote for you?\n\nOh, almost forgot; if you are having technical issues playing the game, start up the game with the other option "safe mody (legacy)" when pressing Play in the Steam library, which basically fixed all the problems I had when I first started up the game. That option also makes it fullscreen, which I recommend when playing this game. :)\n\nSo yeah, GR8 GAME, 10/10 WOULD VOTE FOR BUNNYLORD AGAIN :D","May 14","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each level is like the setup for an action movie and you control a bunch of hitmen out to help a purple bunny win an election by taking out all the criminals in the city to save the future. Yes, the story is quite ridiculous but it is told in a suitably tongue in cheek manner and is still entertaining. The action itself is smooth and enables a lot of cinematic moments as you crash through windows and doors and use your chosen character's special abilities (run and reload, slide and shoot, etc) to clear the levels. The animations are excellent and the level layouts really up the intensity. Each mission has optional objectives used to help determine a perfect clear and achieving them turns the levels into an almost action puzzle-like setup where you have to carefully plan and execute your moves while carefully exploiting all the opportunities presented to you. It's fast, intense and funny (with the occasionaly gratuitious violence and dark humour which may not be to everyone's taste). The 8-bit style pixel art is fantastic too, very detailed with nice little touches everywhere to set the atmosphere. All in all, a strong recommendation if you like action games, shooters in particular and skill-based yet accessible to everyone progression in a game.","May 15","true","10.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each level has it's own song and there are 3 palleted chapters with their own boss. The humor slips right in with Battleblock Theaters style with rgn styled quips from the main character Bunnylord when you start or finish a level. Story is pretty much what you already know from the trailer and description: purple anthromorphic rabbit travels from the future to save it by becoming mayor, and how do you ask? By shooting crime in it's well deserved head.\n\n9 playable characters you unlock by increasing voter approval, adds enough variation to find the right one that sticks each with their own witty dialogue in every situation. (My personal favorite is Mike)\nSome of the later levels can be a bit frustrating as you are introduced to spefic instant-kill type enemies. A major gripe I've had was with the lack of proper key maping or even allowing such a thing in general, seriously, I can't run with the arrow keys on my right hand when fireing, sliding, and reloading with the other.\n\nI've come to reccomend this as the pros greatly outweight the cons so anyone looking for more goofy gorey devolver action Not a Hero is the one for you.","June 2","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/recommended/274270/","gamerrubrix","Gamer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gamerrubrix/","300 products in account","Not A Hero is a 2D Action game. The game is about trying to get a giant purple bunny named Bunnylord to be elected mayor of England to prevent the world from being obliterated.\n\nThe game has 22 stages, where the game primarily involves sliding, executing, moving into cover, and shooting enemies. The gameplay isn't anything spectacular , but it is kinda unique in the way you engage enemies. The action is really fast and frantic. The way to kill enemies is to either shoot them to death, shoot them once at close range for a critical kill, or slide the enemy to trip them up and then execute them while they're on the ground. There are not too many variants of enemies. There are pretty much normal guys with pistols, normal guys with SMGs, big guys with powerful weapons, and ninjas with katanas. Some can be slide tackled and some can't. Anyway, the gameplay itself is fun. It can be a challenge on later levels as well, so it's not a pushover either.\n\nThere are 9 characters you can choose from, and they all have different speed, guns, and abilities. For example, Mike is very fast, has a double-barreled shotgun with very quick executions, while Stanley has a mid-range SMG with a large clip, but moves very slow. They all take advantage of different aspects of the game. Some can shoot while sliding, some are better at close or long range, etc. There's bound to be a character you'll enjoy, and it really adds variety to all the levels. The only issue I have is the controls are kind of iffy. Moving from cover to cover is easy enough, but cancelling out of a slide can be hard or just won't work properly. It doesn't happen that often though, I just noticed it a bit is all.\n\nEach level has one objective that you must complete to beat the game, but there are also 3 optional objectives you can do. Each mission you complete will earn you more approval ratings which will unlock characters quicker. (You only start out with one character) This will make the game much harder as some missions will take lots of tries to do, but ti's nothing painful or keyboard-breaking.\n\n22 levels might sound like a lot, but it's actually pretty short. It took me a little under 9 hours to beat the game will all objectives done 100%. Shave a few hours off if you intend to only beat the game doing the primary goal. This is a bit of a downside, but it is a fun and engaging experience regardless of length.\n\nAll in all, Not A Hero is a fun and addictive action game that I'm sure you'll have fun with in the short time you'll have with it. Depending on how strongly you want this, it might be better to wait for sale.\n\n7/10.","March 7","true","9.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","1"

It was a bit hard, cuz I forgot, its still has no cloud saves, so - my savings are lost in time and space after OS reinstall and I've started from zero twice.\nIn short: its awesome 2.2.5 (but, without marketing b*llshit - 2D game with 3D elements) side-scrolling arcade (lots of powerups and EXPLOSIONS included) shooter with cool chiptune soundtrack and difficult (but in good view of difficult - not like broforce on ironbro) levels.\n\nPros:\n- Graphics. Yep, it wont give you "WOW" effect, but also wont make your eyes bleeding, like lots of hipster-made stuff. Its also very colorfull, but not trippy. Best solution.\n- Soundtrack. OH MY, its one of best soundtracks I heard this year. Different types of chiptune music - from synthwave-like to smthing like chipstep. Its also wont leave feelings of smthing "raw" or "unfinished". Wanna grab it in glorious FLAC later (sadly, there are few problems with soundtrack dlc and idk about its format, so - bandcamp is my friend) :D\n- Difficult. I ll put it in pros, cuz, as I said before, this game isnt "2ez", but also isnt "hard as f*ck".

There are only 3 zones (every has their own assets, but, in fact - difference between them is almost only in their color) and 21 levels (also 3 bonus levels). Yep, story ends then, but... It feels like bird with cuted wings. Heard, DLC incoming, so - maybe they will add more levels. Will wait anyways.\n- Balance. Some characters are overpowered, some - very hard to master. Also, about levels - first half of game will be extremely easy, but then, suddenly, difficult growth and you will meet you burned butt. Rlly. Half of my playtime I spent to master levels, I couldnt complete, cuz its impossible to do it in 1st time. And in second. And in other 10 times too.\n\nSo - its awesome (potentially my personal indie-goty 2k15) game to spend 8-10 hours or so, if you are fan of this genre and wanna find smthing fresh (at least its roll system looks intresting).

His playstyle wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥ like his eating habits. I ran into some big problems shooting fish tanks instead of bad guys and dying in a second because of a easy mistake although the 2 shots he has should hit a fish tank and an enemy. other times I was "executing" and the guy I was finishing off gets up and kill me after I do the execution move, this didn't happen alot but when it did it's annoying.\n\nIt's a challenging game, the mechanics are fun, they don't give a heck about political correctness which is really good to see.\n\nthe story and writing was hit and miss, sometimes I was getting into it, others I thought they weren't trying.

There are 9 characters that you unlock throughout the game and each play pretty differently from eachother (granted there are 3 of them I haven't played yet). There are only 2 things about this game that bother me:  1) When you die, you have to restart the level from the start (this might not be bad to some people, personally it just gets a bit annoying when you get really close to the end and then die by a simple mistake)     2) It's not too long. The game consists of 21 levels which you can get through pretty quickly for the most part, and I believe 3 secret levels that are hidden.

His playstyle wasn't ♥♥♥♥♥ like his eating habits. I ran into some big problems shooting fish tanks instead of bad guys and dying in a second because of a easy mistake although the 2 shots he has should hit a fish tank and an enemy. other times I was "executing" and the guy I was finishing off gets up and kill me after I do the execution move, this didn't happen alot but when it did it's annoying.\n\nIt's a challenging game, the mechanics are fun, they don't give a heck about political correctness which is really good to see.\n\nthe story and writing was hit and miss, sometimes I was getting into it, others I thought they weren't trying. I'd of liked more depth. this game lacks maturity but is too savage for teenagers\n\nOverall this game was a good experience with a lot of fun and replayability. well worth it. great work devonation games for keeping this genre alive!","January 21","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

But I was let down. First of all actual cover based gameplay is the only redeeming factor in this game. But even that is far from perfect. Random enemies that can not be tackled or one shot you usually disturb the flow of combat.  Game advertises 84 chllanges in the trailer which is quite pathetic. These challenges consist of going out of your way to collect "lol son random" items or do the level in a stupidly fast way. While they are fun the first 3 times, it seems like they are far from a selling point to be but on the trailer but who could blame them this game is to short and feature lacking an they had to find a way to fill the trailer with something other then 'monkey cheese LOL random humour" I guess.\n\nMy advice is, don't buy this game.","December 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It has an original and funny storyline, great characters and the artstyle is wonderfull.\nBut jesus christ the mechanics are the worst. The game has a certain flow of making you dash through enemies by killing them quickly by either shooting them or stabbing them. But whenever you try to melee them they often just bounce you back and shoot you in the face or you get bounced off a building. Nice mechanic. Also, hiding prevents you from getting shot, but only from the direction you're standing towards. Which is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t because you only get one side to stand towards and have only one button to use to hide, so when you get surrounded you just freak out instead of switching sides.\n\nLong story short:\nGreat story and theme\nGod awful mechanics\n\nDon't buy this game unless they either fix these mechanics or if you like getting frustrated by bad mechanics.","February 11","false","4.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

The action is overly simplistic.  The "humor" is just really really bad.  Maybe it's British humor (sorry for the oxymoron), but I didn't find anything about the game amusing.  The chatter during gameplay was irritating as well.  I don't think it counts as a bad game, but it's certainly not for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darqfalls/recommended/274270/","Darqfalls","Darqfalls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darqfalls/","120 products in account","This game was... disappointing. Really the only thing that holds up is the humor, and it IS very funny. Bunnylord's randomized speech and what all the characters say, that and the characters themselves, are pretty hilarious, honestly. The actual gameplay is... all in all, confusing. Even just starting the game up for the first time exemplifies this. On a controller, the B and X buttons are used interchangeably as both confirmation buttons AND cancel buttons... just, why? You press the B button to go forward a screen, then that screen will use the B button to go back. If you want to go further you need to press X. It's kinda stupid and confusing, but I guess it's okay once you get used to it. Then there's the combat. Only one character so far (I've unlocked the first four, characters unlock pretty naturally as you play the game, altho doing better at missions will speed up the process) can shoot while moving, and it's extremely inaccurate. The cover system rewards you for being patient. So does the reload time. And the fact that you stop moving when you shoot. So why do most stages have an extremely short time limit? Sure, you can slide past enemies to tackle them to the ground and execute them, but some enemies will kick you away, and there's no indication of which enemies will do that until they actually do that. That's another thing, all the stages and enemies look identical. The first seven enemies take place in warehouses that are all the same color. You fight Russian mobsters with shotguns and pistols, usually pistols. At some point in there, the police show up. They're pretty much identical, just much harder to kill. I probably wouldn't have known that if I hadn't played Hotline Miami first. Hell, the only way I tried killing them that worked was executing them, but that usually got you killed by their swarm of buddies, or putting up a turret, but they burst in through every window as you move past them, so you're encouraged to just run. After that, you move to a different part of town. It's supposed to be a park. It's more warehouses, this time they're green instead of pink. You fight sterotypical "gangstas" (they're both white and black, thought that was a nice touch, altho part of me wonders if they didn't do that to keep their asses safe) with pistols, sub-machine guns, and shotguns. This time, the shotgunners don't kick you away, the sub-machine gunners do, altho only specific ones. Makes sense, right? I only got a few stages in, I just couldn't push myself to do it anymore, it just wasn't fun. You really have to take cover here against the SMGers, but they also move in on your position, so you have to be constantly moving, yet constantly shooting, which requires you to stop moving. There are also some degrees of stealth in this game, which I like, altho so far I haven't found any characters that can really capitalize on it. Generally if you fire one shot, everyone knows where you're at, which is accurate at least. I think there are melee characters down the road that can probably kill people without alerting everyone else. But all in all, this was a rather convoluted experience. The game mechanics clash, there is some degree of artificial difficulty, and everything is same-y and boring. Pick this up if it goes on sale for cheap. I paid 9 dollars for it, and it was too much.\n\nEDIT: Oh, forgot to mention, the music and sounds are pretty great, but that brings me to another point. This game does not take itself seriously at all, yet enemies beg for mercy when you're about to execute them, only to be abruptly cut off by, well, dying. This even happens with the cops. It's something else that conflicts with the game. It seems rather sadistic, which I'm alright with if it's trying to get a message across, but this is sadism just for sadism, which, again, is okay if the game is at least taking itself seriously, but this one just doesn't.","June 23, 2015","false","1.3"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","4"

You have to complete all the extra objectives in one run (no going in with one character, getting one, and then bringing another character to get another), so you end up using only one or two. The cover/execution mechanic is nice, until 4 enemies are stacked up so they go wonky.\n\nThere are no checkpoints, and many missions have a sudden difficulty spike at the end (usually when SWAT teams start pouring into the level for no real reason). The enemies are not randomized, but the powerups are. So you end up doing the exact same movements for the first 80% of a mission, over and over, so you can get back to the shootout at the end that killed you. When there's no challenge in a section but you're forced to replay it over and over (and with no checkpoints your progress is reset anyway), it's really easy to just go for the quit button instead.\n\nIt's not BAD, but Not a Hero 2 has the potential to be GREAT.\n\nRecommendations for the developers (update/sequel):\n\n- Make it more like 10 extra objectives per level, that are harder but require different characters. Encourage and reward replays.\n\n- Add checkpoints, if only at boss battles / cinematic events. Or split them into mission 10-1 / 10-2, etc.\n\n- Get rid of the "2 people are standing next to each other, so sliding just knocks you down because the second one magically punches you" mechanic\n\n- Add a level editor / something to extend the game and let people think of new scenarios\n\n- More characters with more variety (#1 will play into this)\n\n- Fix the bug where Xbox One controllers fire constantly (due to it always thinking RT is held down unless you hold LT down)","June 25, 2015","false","14.4"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

In some instances it is similar in that to Dennaton Games' Hotline Miami series these main similarities is obviously the use of pixel style artwork and it's difficult combat. The combat although 2D is actually rather fun as the game uses a simply cover mechanic that is if you press a certain button your character will dash to the next point in cover and become slightly darker to indicate cover is now being used. You also have health in the game 5 bars to be precise which regenerate if given time, I believe if you take the game slowly then the regenerative health can be a bit much but if you opt for the faster route and try to gain the secondary optional goals in a mission then you will find it can disappear quite quickly.\n\nIn NOT A HERO, you have numerous different characters that have specific traits associated with them on top of their stereotyped voice acting. I have only unlocked a few of these characters but i'll explain one or two, firstly my favourite so far has to be Cletus why? He's Scottish or atleast the voice actor is pretending to be and to add to it his mighty fine nationality he's also from Glasgow, Scotland's very own city of violence and destruction (Huzzah). What does he have that's actually appealing, he has a shotgun as quite the boomstick fan I love a good shotgun who needs accuracy when your wielding a shotgun eh? The shotgun comes with 5 rounds so can be a bit of an issue when reloading and numerous enemies are falling onto you from all directions. You can use the shotgun to blow open doors which can knock out enemies behind it however watch you don't use explosive rounds when you do this I managed to bug the door out with it taking me across the map and eventually getting me killed :P. Another character is Jesus or for some reason i'm compelled to call him Carlos so Carlos (Jesus) is a Spanish passionate dancing nutcase with a bad case of the pelvic thrusts who joins the crew a bit into the game but not that far. His armament of choice is an automatic handgun and the ability to shoot while dashing for cover or across the floor. This may not seem ideal dashing towards a man with a shotgun and his 3 cronies but you'd be surprised how effective it is, the pistol comes with around 20 rounds you can have more if you find the highcapacity magazine pickups though once the ammo is expended it's back to 20. I quite enjoy Carlos (Jesus) as a character and have found myself playing as him rather frequently as his auto pistol does wonders against crowds, my only downside with him is that he fires 3 bullets whilst executing someone so when chaining a few executions together you can find yourself having to reload quickly. Anyways this is only two of the many possible characters that are in the game there is others with sawn-off shotguns, pistols and all sorts of crazy abilities so I'd urge you to experiment if your having difficulty with a level to try other Non-Heros you have at your disposal.\n\nThere is more I might be able to say regarding the game and how i've experienced it so far but to just summarise it's a very fun 2D gore galore shoot 'em and toot 'em that Hotline fans who are waiting on HM:WN2's workshop to be released should enjoy. Fans of pixel art and a good blast 'em should also enjoy this.","May 15, 2015","true","4.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","33","3","9","3","1"

The gameplay is mediocre, but enoyable enough. The writing is where it falls absolutely flat. Let me put it this way: If you are twelve years old and find "lol random spork le maymay" humor funny, then this will be your jam. If you are a grown-♥♥♥ person, skip it. Nearly all of the humor in the game is essentially, "Haha, I'm saying a random word. Banana!"\n\nIt's criminally unfunny. A random person off the street could write better comedy. I would honestly be surprised if their writer was over the age of 15. Kudos, I guess, for letting a child express themselves.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparticusjoe/recommended/274270/","Sparticusjoe","Orsonposter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparticusjoe/","315 products in account","The game is very fun, very violent, very funny, and has all the ingredients to being an absolutley phenominal game. It is also borderline unplayable from having one of the worst control schemes I've ever encountered in a PC game, with absolutely no ability to rebind the controls at all. Browsing the forum shows that the developers are aware that at least a handful of people want the ability to do this, and have responded by basically saying it's not going to happen.\n\nYou have to, and I do mean have to, move your character with the arrow keys. Space reloads, X slides (something you'll be doing absolutely constantly, so why they'd put it on the X key I have no idea), C shoots (seriously, the C button on a keyboard is shooting. In a game that's 100 percent shooting.) and V is your secondary weapon (think grenades, etc.)\n\nThose are all the controls the game has, except for selecting things in the menu, which is done with, you guessed it, the Enter button. I repeat, absolutely none of these controls can be bound to anything else, at all.\n\nHope you like having your hand in a weird claw shape the whole time you try to play the game, because you're gonna need it. Also hope you're not, I dunno, right handed, because unlike 99.9 percent of all other games on earth, your right hands' on character movement duties in Not A Hero, for some reason!\n\nThe developers' solution to this appears to be to have you plug an XBOX controller into your computer. I can't speak for if the game plays better on it, because it seems rather silly to go buy a peripheral for a console so that I can play a PC game. I've never had to use a controller on a game before, as rebinding keys is just kind of something every game ever lets you do. Hotline Miami had a nearly perfect control scheme, and they still bothered giving players the option to change it.\n\nHell, I can rebind controls in Half Life. You know, that game that came out nearly twenty years ago. Oh, and in games from the freaking PS1. But for a brand-new PC game, there's no ability to do it nor do the devs intend on adding it, so as is the game is, while not unplayable, way clunkier and less pleasant to play than it has any reason to be.\n\nPutting V as the secondary makes the least sense of all, as if your index finger is on C (which it will be, as 99 percent of the game is just mashing the shoot button), you have to move it to hit V, something you will probably not remember to do in the heat of the very, very fast paced combat this game has. Keep in mind, while this sounds like a minor complaint, this game has four total controls, and essentially forces you to use two fingers to use them for no real reason at all.\n\nAlso, for anyone that minds, the game has no windowed mode and the forum's pretty well silent in terms of dev participation so I can pretty well assume it never will.\n\nThat all said, the writing's very funny, the action's great when you can get it to actually work, and the whole thing is a black as night comedy that is the kind of thing I'd normally love. The game has tons of content. But none of that really matters when it's so clunky and hard to play, and when it would be maybe ten seconds of coding to fix all of it.\n\nI would gladly, gladly retract all this and write a glowing review if the game would just have the ability to rebind controls added, as that's about the only reason I can't recommend this. However, had i known that the controls were so unintuitive and bad prior to buying the game, I would not have bought the game, so I'm hoping maybe this helps someone out there.","July 17, 2015","false","2.6"," 84 of 176 people (48%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","48","84","176","17","17"

For example, I've killed the end-boss a few times, but still just missed to get away because of accidentely falling of a rooftop\n- After a few levels, I needed to memorize where the baddies where in order to be able to pass them, some baddies are just too fast (almost like knowing to press when to press what button)\n- Playable Characters are unbalanced in my opinion. Once the samurai/ninja levels came up, I could only pass them with cletus (because of the one shot kill, they were just too fast for the other characters) - allthough there is one other character with a shotgun and is much faster than cletus, he only has 2 bullets and reloading takes so long that you will be killed by ninja.\n- strange keyboard configuration, reloading is just irritating\n\nReally too bad, the game has great potential, but If it where my game, I would just give the playable characters unlimited (standard) bullets without reloading and then you can add more baddies, this would give more action to the game and would result in less memorizing.","August 23, 2015","false","9.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

But not long into the first act I found myself struggling with the controls which are often clunky and difficult. There aren't many shooting games that require you to manually reload and with good reason because it ruins the flow of the action and I often forget I have to manually reload because again, not many shooting games make you do that. Levels are neatly and colorfully designed but beyond that they very quickly become the definition of repetitiveness. I was interested with the SWAT enemies when they first showed up but that interest quickly turned to anger when I realized that they were literally harder to kill than all the Russians I just shot, not to mention the sheer amount of them, escape became impossible and I died and was forced to do the entire tedious level all over again.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/recommended/274270/","realkct","Real KCT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/","261 products in account","With a preview article appearing in free London rag 'The Metro', it seemed that NOT A HERO was destined for great things in May 2015. However, due to a release delay & several unfortunate control related hiccups at launch it seemingly fizzled away without the usual hype you seem to see from the YouTubers let's playing the current indie darling.\n\nThis title is a 2.5D (or Iso-slant as they call it) fast paced, pixel art cover shooter. Think Gunpoint mixed with the frantic action of Hotline Miami. You're tasked with helping an anthropomorphic alien known as BUNNYLORD to become mayor. His main strategy which he'll brief you with in hilariously randomized pre-level sequences is to mostly 'kill people very dead awesomely' and also drink milkshakes.\n\nRoll7 are an English studio and it tells through this game with almost all the main characters given regional UK dialects. While it doesn't offer much of anything in the way of story or character development, it's a nice touch to distinguish different skill types on your controllable protagonist.\n\nWhile getting from one end of a level to the end isn't particularly difficult, each stage will come with several additional challenges. Most are time or kill streak related & nearing the end of the game, these will require almost pin-point reflexes and stratagem to make it through.\n\nWhile the game itself is a lot of fun, humorous & challenging, the major flaws arrive in that only 1 of the 8 or so unlockable characters (Mike) is actually a viable option to complete the game & all its challenges. While it's still amusing to dabble with the others, more balancing should have been carried out to provide more possiblities in playing the game & using all the characters in a different fashion.\n\nKeeping in mind the scope & budget of the game, it would have also been nice to see a bit more story originating from Bunnylord's FUN CLUB members.\n\nWhile perhaps not in the upper echelon of the current golden age of indie steam titles, it's still rather good. Hopefully this won't be the last we see of Bunnylord from Roll7. While it's £10 full price might be a hard sell to those who weren't already sold on the trailer (which is still dare I say one of the best on the service), it'd almost be impossible to pick this up during a sale or bundle & not have a good time.","May 14, 2015","true","9.4"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","27","3","11","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dnaskunk/recommended/274270/","dnaskunk","Skunk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dnaskunk/","1042 products in account","NOT A HERO is another Retro style shooter that tries a bit too hard to be funny.\n\nI purchased NOT A HERO based on the release trailer, which I did find to be entertaining and humorous. I came in with high expectations. It showed very nice looking pixel style graphics, many unique characters, and exciting mission segments.\n\nNow, I've only played through the first series of levels, but I found myself bored and decided to take a break to write this review. The plot of NOT A HERO involves playing as different characters in order to assist Bunnylord in becoming Mayor. You will do this by assassinating certain people, destroying gang hideouts, and other forms of destroying crime by committing it.\n\nThe Levels -\nAs I mentioned before, I only played through the first section of levels. These first levels appeared extremely bland to me. Colors consisted of Red and Grey, and it didn't feel like I was ever changing levels after moving on. There are windows to jump through, and doors to open, but so far that is the only interaction I've discovered. I understand that there are secret areas, but I've yet to find any.\n\nI was surprised by the bland levels because the diner and office area are very detailed and attractive. I stopped playing when I got to the "Green Levels," which I will call them. They looked almost exactly the same as the "Red Levels." Aside from a few different assets use for cover, which appeared to just be recolored.\n\nI will try to continue playing to see if the levels become more interesting, but so far, they are just boring.\n\nThe Characters -\nI don't have a whole lot to say about the characters since I've only unlocked four of them.\n\nYou've got the starter pistol guy, the woman that can run and shoot/reload, the country shotgun guy, and a.. colorful Jesus. I find these characters so far to be generic and uninspired. Just another attempt at humor that lacks creativity. They are varied skill-wise, and it's sometimes helpful to try a different one if you are struggling to complete all the bonus objectives in a level. I may add more to this after unlocking a few more.\n\nThe main character in this game is Bunnylord. As I spoke of before, he is doing what he can to become mayor of the city. I found myself skipping most of his dialogue because it was so.. puerile.\n\nThe humor in NOT A HERO had to have been written by a teenager. A teenager that just discovered balls and ♥♥♥♥♥ jokes, and cursing without getting in trouble by his parents.\n\nMaybe that's the direction they were going for. I'm sure some people will find it funny.\n\nThe Gameplay -\nIt feels good with a controller. The controls are extremely basic. You could probably play this on an NES controller(not that this is a bad thing). It's fluid, smooth, and responsive, so I'll give it that. Unfortunately, the simple controls sometimes cause you to do one thing when trying to do another.\n\nConclusion -\nI think that about covers it. Feel free to ask me any questions. I may provide some updates, or even change my opinion on recommendation, but I can't as of now.\n\nI like Devolver Digital. Broforce was funny, colorful, and fun. NOT A HERO is childish, bland, and boring.\n\nIf you have the money, pick up Broforce instead of this one.","May 14, 2015","false","1.7"," 55 of 132 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","55","132","4","14"

Characters (9 of them) are distinct and provide very different game experiences, although one or two are unfortunately rendered obsolete by even more specialised later unlocks (looking at you Cletus). Enough levels to keep you interested, and difficult enough (especially with optional side objectives) to keep the shortish levels playable. There's no checkpoint system, but very rarely does dying in the final stretch of a level seem like any more a punishment than dying in the opening corridor. You're never more than a second or two away from the next playthrough, in any case.\n\nComparison have been drawn to Hotline Miami, due to the pace, twitchy skills and the ease with which everything on screen dies, but NOT A HERO does a number of things differently. Infinite ammo, cover, the occasional defenestration-based platforming section and a (very small) pool of regenerating health turn the central challenge from one of 'how do I make sure I'm the only thing left alive' to 'how do i move quick enough through these enemies to reach that payphone in the next building'.\n\nOverall, if ever you'e after an arcadey, gratifying experience without any of the drama of a real storyline, and the idea of a main character voiced by a squeaky airing cupboard door (no really) appeals to you, this is the game for you.\n\nAnd most importantly, vote Bunnylord!","December 20, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even characters who are similar will have a key difference that changes the experience entirely, such as an ability that replaces using special weapons.\n\nOn top of the unique characters, each stage had 3 special challenges that aren't required to unlock the next stage but are required to see the true ending of the game.\n\nThe game itself is challenging without ever being unfair.  There are random power-ups that can make a stage much easier but your success is far more skill based than luck based, as no matter how good the power-up you find is, it won't last long and it won't replace ability.  The difficulty scaling is beatiful, from a breeze in the first few stages to brutally hard at the finale, but the pacing matches your skill -- if you're doing very well no stage will last long and it goes well within the madcap world the game presents.\n\nFinally, its characters rival Team Fortress 2 in terms of being unique and colourful and their banter is spot on as they scream and swear in unique ways when things go wrong and have different ways of expressing their satisfaction when things go right.\n\nThis is a game that I'd love to see more of and I'd automatically snap up a sequel.","August 27, 2015","true","37.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Make it more fun by representing BunnyLord\nTrying to get some people motivate for a event? Explain to them why BunnyLord would see this as a opporunity to improve mankind and be cool\nBeating up some sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥? Yell it into his face so he knows why he is being beaten up.\nBut really what is Not a HERO about?\n\nThe totally rad BunnyLord came from the future to be elected mayor of your city because if he's not there will be like a totally unrad doom explosion and so in order to be elected BunnyLord and his Fun Club will eliminate all crime... by shooting it in it's ugly face.\n\nAnd so we come to the gameplay:\n\nNow Not a HERO is technically speaking a 2d “cover based” shooter but if you’re like me then it’s more like a run and melee/shotgun enemies down and before you know it, you’ve fell in love with Mike and are on a 30 Killstreak through a five story building and only 35 seconds into the mission.\n\nThat sounds like a lot? It’s not really because most of the game is designed around the idea of constantly switching between always moving and using the cover mechanic to plan ahead. X is your slide which does two things, slide you into cover and knock enemies over. C is your fire button and if someone is knock over to assassinate them. Your V is for special weapons which can be found in the levels and the rest are your arrow keys. Quite simply mechanics, right? What ties it all together are the characters, which there are plenty of and different enough to be enjoyable. Mike, the one I mentioned earlier, for example has a shotgun and a machete. He is a fast character which can silently assassinate enemies and has a powerful shotgun, but it only has two shots and the reload is very long. So most of the time you will be tackling enemies left and right and just slicing through their necks like a extremely hot knife through warm butter… for BunnyLord’s election of course, not because you enjoy killing all these hopeless meatbags.\n\nSo it’s a game with simplistic controls? Nothing new, there are plenty like that out there and the idea for the core gameplay isn’t neither. But most levels will force you to pick your battles. Sure you can just murder your way through a level, that’s easy, but completing the additional goals for extra glory to BunnyLord can be quite challenging. Even more you can’t complete all 3 additional task in separate runs of one level. It all needs to be done in one try which becomes especially hard if you’re asked to rush through a level in 30 seconds to find a ♥♥♥♥ing phone which is hidden somewhere in that ♥♥♥♥ing level and there are like 5 ♥♥♥♥ers which can’t be knock down for assassinating so you just have to ♥♥♥♥ing murder them and waste your ♥♥♥♥ing precious time… On the other hand the soundtrack really helped me let my rage flow into Mike and the vicious killing rampages I have. The 8bit style of music feels good and smooth and even after trying a level several times doesn’t become annoying.\n\n\nTo sum it all up: Not a HERO is a fast paced game about a time traveling bunny who wants to become the mayor and gets a bunch of assassin to do his campaigning. The gameplay, art style and soundtrack fit wonderfully together, they are lots of milkshakes in it and it’s even political.\n\n\nAnd really what is a little bit of violence for a better tomorrow?","November 28, 2015","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And his solution to erradicate violence is MORE ♥♥♥♥ING VIOLENCE. YES, THANK YOU, no more stupid excuses to kill people in videogames such as "they are bad guys and you are the good guy GOD BLESS MURICA" and something like that.\n\n·Gameplay: 2D action run n gun game with a really cool set of characters with their own abilities, full with awesome combat that can be challenging AND ALSO WITH SIDE MISSIONS WITHIN THE MISSION AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAND WITH SECRETS MISSIONS WITHIN THOSE MISSIONS TOO?!?!?!?!?! I'LL HAVE 8, PLEASE.\n\n·Duration: It's not that long, but you are going to have a great time playing this. And replaying the levels with all the characters is just ♥♥♥♥ing MAJESTIC.\n\n·Oh, and one more thing: the things that Bunnylord says in the game are random. Yep, I'm not ♥♥♥♥ing kidding: One time I was collecting old coffe makers for kids and when I replayed the mission the coffe makers became furious bees, and that was even funnier.\n\nI don't know how Devolver Digital do it, but they have the magic touch with almost everything they publish. And of course, ♥♥♥♥ing awesome job Roll7, this ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ing AMAZING!!!!\n\nYou see those 12,99 bucks? WORTH. EVERY. ♥♥♥♥ING. PENNY. Really, buy this game without hesitate. DO IT FOR BUNNYLORD!!!\n\nFinal Score: "20% hero, 80% drunk"/10","October 14, 2015","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The action is great and so is the humor. It keeps track of various stats for each level and the things that Bunnylord tells you are determined by a sort of Mad Libs system, so you have multiple reasons to replay levels.\n\nMy objections are few, but I think that the player can come to terms with them and still find the game to be incredibly enjoyable. Objection #1 is that the 3 out of 4 secret levels (the 4th secret level is meant to be a joke that's next to impossible NOT to beat) that the game keeps stats for are not acknowledged in the order that they are discovered in. To elaborate, each of the 3 districts has 1 secret level that you can view stats for, but the 1st district's secret level stats are shown as "SECRET 3", the 2nd district's secret level stats are shown as "SECRET 1" and the 3rd district's secret level stats are shown as "SECRET 2". Objection #2 is that it seems that each character that you can play as will not necessarily be able to complete all 3 extra objectives for certain levels. Objection #3 is that it can be very difficult to understand the spoken dialogue due to the thick British accents and terminology. The 4th and final objection is that Xbox One will be getting a Super Snazzy Edition of this game with 3 extra levels where you can play as Bunnylord, but it doesn't seem like they'll be offering the same courtesy to PC users.\n\nAs I said, I believe that once you come to terms with these objections, then you can truly enjoy this game. Do I recommend this game? Well, I see no "Hell, yeah!" button to press, so I'm going to have to settle for "Yes". You'll feel like a badass as you off bad guys and then laugh that newly-acquired badass off at its humor. This game deserves an entire friggin' FRANCHISE!

But when you get into combat, aka the action portion of the game, HOLY ♥♥♥♥! This game just change gears real fast, like Mega Man where the moment the enemies appear ♥♥♥♥ just got real.\n\nGraphics: The pixel aren't really all that different from most of the sprite based games I have played.

The controls are tight and responsive, as you'd probably expect from the people who made the equally excellent Olli Olli. The music is a delight, the visuals appropriately low-fi. The humor has some pretty hard swings, alternating between "lulz random" and genuinely clever. Not particularly long, but that also means it doesn't overstay its welcome. If you're looking for a fun little arcadey diversion for a couple of days, you can't go wrong.\n\nOh, and this game is British as ♥♥♥♥.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioG/recommended/274270/","RadioG","RadioactiveGazz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RadioG/","252 products in account","I recommend this to people who get addicted to trying to puzzle their way through challenging pizelated violent scenarios. You know, Hotline Miami (which I'm sure pops up in these reviews a lot). It's got some fun voice acting, music, visuals and the gameplay is pretty solid, too. But often I couldn't tell if it wanted me to play fast or cautious. Neither seemed to 'fit', whereas a game that supports both options, I'd want both to feel right. When found a playstyle that worked, it was the one that boiled all the game's nuance to sliding at people and doing a ground takedown over and over again with the fastest guy. Now I feel like i'm playing the game right but I'm having a lot less fun. I am racking up all the objectives, though.\n\nThe controls can bugger off. We have a million buttons on any modern controller, why is it the same button to run at an enemy AND jump into cover? These are opposite actions, and the game often confuses the two. Same goes for ground takedowns and just regular firing. It's infuriating in the wrong ways most of the time. When it's infuriating in the right ways is when it really shines, and that happens just often enough. Completing a level with all objectives is often rewarded, and the flow of levels seems pretty well thought out, too. I wish it would use these objectives to encourage changes in playstyle, but sticking to the fast guy is usually the way to go, once you have him.\n\nAlso the writing is pants. They seem to have a wonderful handle on joke structure but not joke content. It's just random crap they thought up and giggled at, when they could have sat down for 10 more minutes and made something way funnier if they just put time and thought into it. and they even have art accompanying some of these jokes, which makes it seem even worse. If you're having someone animate a joke, put the effort into making it worth animating. There were times when jokes really landed, at least on a basic level, but it wasn't frequent. And their use of dark humour seemed unearned and uncomfortable. "Look, we beat this guy to death" isn't a joke. It's weak. The writing is what bothers me the most about this game.\n\nAnyway, this has been a fairly negative review, but it's far from a bad game. Just the ways it needs improvement seem basic, like they just needed to put more thought into it or another pair of eyes on it during production. It's a good game. I just really wish it could have been great.","August 24, 2015","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Characters (9 of them) are distinct and provide very different game experiences, although one or two are unfortunately rendered obsolete by even more specialised later unlocks (looking at you Cletus). Enough levels to keep you interested, and difficult enough (especially with optional side objectives) to keep the shortish levels playable. There's no checkpoint system, but very rarely does dying in the final stretch of a level seem like any more a punishment than dying in the opening corridor. You're never more than a second or two away from the next playthrough, in any case.\n\nComparison have been drawn to Hotline Miami, due to the pace, twitchy skills and the ease with which everything on screen dies, but NOT A HERO does a number of things differently. Infinite ammo, cover, the occasional defenestration-based platforming section and a (very small) pool of regenerating health turn the central challenge from one of 'how do I make sure I'm the only thing left alive' to 'how do i move quick enough through these enemies to reach that payphone in the next building'.\n\nOverall, if ever you'e after an arcadey, gratifying experience without any of the drama of a real storyline, and the idea of a main character voiced by a squeaky airing cupboard door (no really) appeals to you, this is the game for you.\n\nAnd most importantly, vote Bunnylord!","December 20, 2015","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's enjoyable yes, and the voice acting is charming. Pixel art is well done and the gameplay is smooth.\n\nI start the game every now and then and I play maybe 15 minutes and quit when I get bored.\nBut it's still not a bad game and I haven´t encountered a single bug. I find its just a question of what tickles your fancy.\nIts casual yet challenging because the game drives you to finish each level with various extra goals for a better score.\n\nIts a very good game to have on your laptop and if you spend some time in a hotel and want to play some quick game. It doesn't require a gamepad, keyboard is ok. I would categorize this game between gunpoint and super time force ultra if you are familiar with the titles.\n\nBut If you are not too enthusiastic about the "pixel art indie wave" then it's maybe not for you.\nIf you love pixel art, then you should definitely have this in your library.","December 30, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Second, lots of people have been referencing to Hotline Miami and the like. I have not played those games.\nAnyways, this game is challenging, but forgiving, which I like. The premise of the story is that you go around completing tasks which will help your bunny acomplice gain points on the polls, which will help him get elected to the mayor of England. The bunny's strategy is to show people he is ready to kill crime in the face, and that is exactly what you do. There are 9 characters to choose from. Although all of them are well balanced and good for different strategies, you unlock them in a linear path, starting with Steve, who is seemingly the most in-between the others, allowing you to play as him without so much as a hiccup until you unlock a character who you end up being really good with. Although the enemies are generally the same until you finish the boss and move on to another gang, the setting, objectives, maps, etc. provide a different expirience every level. This is the first game I had genuine fun with in a long time (other than Half Life 2).\n\nEDIT:\nCurrently I'm stuck on the level where you have to blow up the fish tanks, because of a number of things leading to my failure again and again.\n1. A samarui (which will kill you instantly with their sword) comes at me. I shoot them, but there is a fish tank between us, and they survive and kill me, even though I was playing as Mike, with his really powerful shotgun.\n2. I slide to cover, but for some reason, I stop halfway and get killed by the hail of gunfire coming whilst I do that.\n3. I somehowhave 0 bullets when I attempt to shoot a ninja point-blank with my shotgun.\nPLEASE! PLEASE, I BEG YOU! On the longer levels in china, PLEASE add a checkpoint halfway or something. I need it, otherwise I will rage whilst playing the same thing several times and forget my mistakes, and then make them again until I get lucky once and make it to the end of the level. This is still a great game, but PLEASE! You're killing me guys (both in-game and figuratively).","October 15, 2015","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Though it's got quite a bit of violence and some cussing, it's not super bad, and the art and humor makes up for it. It's really detailed with a lot to notice in the levels and talking with bunnylord. Anyway, I'll update this review as I play, but It's already pretty darn fun.\nEDIT: I still haven't played a ton more, but I did a few more missions. It's still pretty cool, nice visuals, awesome music, and interesting story.\nAfter the 2nd mission it gets a lot harder to be perfect. On each level there are a few goals to achieve, and you can only get perfect on the level if you get them all in one run. Each goal by itself is fine, but when mixed with others it can become quite difficult.\nFor example: Killing everyone, killing 5 without getting hit, and beating it in 100 seconds all in one mission. It sounds fine, but some of it is a bit annoying.\nStill fun though.","May 14, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whenever I beat a level I usually skipped most of the restaurant cutscene because I just wanted to play the next level. It was hard to listen to the jokes the game was throwing at me while I was hard-pressed trying not to get shot.\n\n-The gameplay was extremely frustrating to the point of being unfair, mostly due to the fact that I was trying to get Global Megalord on each level. I was experiencing a few cheap deaths and a a lot challenges were enraging to say the least. One checkpoint on each level would have made this more fun and less infuriating.\n\n- I found that either Mike is extremely overpowered, or the others are very underpowered. I was using Mike to beat most of the levels and I wanted a reason to use the other characters.\n\n- The game could get repetitive at times. Most of the side challenges were used on multiple occasions. The challenges were usually something like this: Collect this thing, get a kill streak, kill multiple people in a short amount of time, collect all of the power-ups, kill this dude, kill people using executions or critical hits, etc.\n\n- Little to no replayability once you get Global Megalord on each level.\n\nTo summarize it:\n\nGreat music\n\nFrustrating, tough, rewarding gameplay\n\nMultiple characters\n\nSarcastic and humorous storyline\n\nKinda repetitive\n\nVery small amount of replayability.\n\n\nAbove all, this game deserves way, WAY more attention. I would highly recommend getting this while it is on sale.\n\n\n7.8/10","July 23, 2015","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Our ray of hope is Bunnylord, an anthropomorphic purple rabbit that needs the help of a very peculiar group of misfits to help him get elected as mayor, by obliterating the current crime wave in the city, using a more "hands on" approach than usual, since voters need to see quick and effective results to insure those votes!\n\nNot a Hero can be described as an arcade-style, run-and-gun shooter with simple covert mechanics (pretty much feels like a combination between Bonanza Bros & Broforce). There is a pattern on most missions: funny intro that overviews the situation at hand, disposal of pretty much every enemy you come across and fulfillment of a side objective such as rescuing hostages, plastering posters, collecting random stuff (truly random stuff if I may add!), etc.\n\nThe game features a solid pixel styled appearance, an awesome chiptune soundtrack and some hillarious voicework. The characters at your disposal feature some variations in their gameplay mechanics so its easy to find someone that suits you best. Although the game can be finished in less than 8 hours, fulfilling all of the missions requests and finding the secret missions can give this game more playtime. All in all, this is a really fun action title that anyone who likes arcade-style action should give a try!\n\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The crazy crime-syndicated action of Saints Row, mixed with the gameplay of titles such as Elevator Action, with graphics that remind you of VVVVVV with more color and gory goodness. The music is also complete madness. I get crazy over good chiptune Nintendo-type melodies, and this game has some awesome tunes.\n\nThe characters in this game present unique challenges as they do have differing attributes and disadvantages. Characters like Jesus are speedy so he can complete the speed challenges, but his health goes down quicker so more damaging enemies will make quick work of him. Others can have more damage at the expense of slower reload rates and speed to evade attacks. Stealth is also needed in missions where you have to save hostages as up-front confrontation is impossible.\n\nGameplay is frenetic and it gets real hard as you progress but it is so fun, that it could be something to just shrug off and continue.\n\nOverall, if you are into challenging games, fanatic about gore, and crazy about retro graphics, buy this game. I bought it at a discount and do not regret it.","March 17","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Our ray of hope is Bunnylord, an anthropomorphic purple rabbit that needs the help of a very peculiar group of misfits to help him get elected as mayor, by obliterating the current crime wave in the city, using a more "hands on" approach than usual, since voters need to see quick and effective results to insure those votes!\n\nNot a Hero can be described as an arcade-style, run-and-gun shooter with simple covert mechanics (pretty much feels like a combination between Bonanza Bros & Broforce). There is a pattern on most missions: funny intro that overviews the situation at hand, disposal of pretty much every enemy you come across and fulfillment of a side objective such as rescuing hostages, plastering posters, collecting random stuff (truly random stuff if I may add!), etc.\n\nThe game features a solid pixel styled appearance, an awesome chiptune soundtrack and some hillarious voicework. The characters at your disposal feature some variations in their gameplay mechanics so its easy to find someone that suits you best. Although the game can be finished in less than 8 hours, fulfilling all of the missions requests and finding the secret missions can give this game more playtime. All in all, this is a really fun action title that anyone who likes arcade-style action should give a try!\n\n\n","December 2, 2015","true","34.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you have to do is press Alt + Enter with the game running to make it go full screen.\n\nI don't think I've ever gotten 100% of a game's Steam achievements before but I enjoyed this one so much that getting them all was a happy byproduct of playing it.\n\nThe gameplay is fast 2D shooting with different characters catering to different playstyles. Each character also represents a British stereotype, often ones that you don't get to see much in any media, let alone in games. I don't think I'll ever play another game where my favourite character sounds like they're from St Helens and if you're not from Northern England you'll probably have no idea where that is. The stereotypes are funny and weird without being nasty which is great.\n\nThere's about twenty levels split into three sections (Downtown, Council Estate and Chinatown) with slightly different enemy types in each section. The basic mission objectives are varied and there's decent replayability provided by bonus objectives which amp up the difficulty or force you to change up your playstyle. Nothing groundbreaking but it is all done very well.\n\nBunny Lord, the main character and your boss, is a random "crazy" character but as in the best farce/absurd comedies while what Bunny Lord is trying to achieve (winning a Mayoral Election via a literal war on crime so that he can save the future (which he is from) from disaster) is crazy he presents a twisted logic behind it that makes it compelling. For instance, in one mission you have to escort an old lady (don't worry she's invulnerable) through a council estate full of heavily armed gangsters. After the mission Bunny Lord acknowledges this seems like a waste of time but, he reasons, old people love to talk and are very likely to vote thus this act of kindness is likely to win him votes. Very silly but it almost makes sense if you squint at it. The game has enough awareness and wit that it remains very funny throughout.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","April 24","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

What you have to do is press Alt + Enter with the game running to make it go full screen.\n\nI don't think I've ever gotten 100% of a game's Steam achievements before but I enjoyed this one so much that getting them all was a happy byproduct of playing it.\n\nThe gameplay is fast 2D shooting with different characters catering to different playstyles. Each character also represents a British stereotype, often ones that you don't get to see much in any media, let alone in games. I don't think I'll ever play another game where my favourite character sounds like they're from St Helens and if you're not from Northern England you'll probably have no idea where that is. The stereotypes are funny and weird without being nasty which is great.\n\nThere's about twenty levels split into three sections (Downtown, Council Estate and Chinatown) with slightly different enemy types in each section. The basic mission objectives are varied and there's decent replayability provided by bonus objectives which amp up the difficulty or force you to change up your playstyle. Nothing groundbreaking but it is all done very well.\n\nBunny Lord, the main character and your boss, is a random "crazy" character but as in the best farce/absurd comedies while what Bunny Lord is trying to achieve (winning a Mayoral Election via a literal war on crime so that he can save the future (which he is from) from disaster) is crazy he presents a twisted logic behind it that makes it compelling. For instance, in one mission you have to escort an old lady (don't worry she's invulnerable) through a council estate full of heavily armed gangsters. After the mission Bunny Lord acknowledges this seems like a waste of time but, he reasons, old people love to talk and are very likely to vote thus this act of kindness is likely to win him votes. Very silly but it almost makes sense if you squint at it. The game has enough awareness and wit that it remains very funny throughout.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","April 24","true","22.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the get go you're told by a giant talking purple rabbit from the future to shoot gang members so the British public will elect him as ruler of England and prevent the world from ending. From there on you're sent on 21 missions set in various warehouses and tower blocks, all filled with various thugs and criminals to shoot your way through.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough: you run through a series of 2D buildings fighting enemies in short, fast-paced battles, using a basic cover mechanic to avoid being shot along the way and regenerate health when necessary. The same cover button can be used to tackle and trip over enemies, leaving them incapacitated for a short while and vulnerable for a stylish execution move. Fallen enemies can occasionally drop special ammo types that last until the next time you reload your weapon. Sometimes these effects are useful, and sometimes they just add a brief special effect to your ammunition, such as flame ammo or disintegration beams. There are also special weapons found in certain places, offering you powerful, limited use attacks for the more difficult sections.\n\nSuccessfully completing missions (and the optional objectives in each one) increases BunnyLord's approval rating. High ratings result in more characters being unlocked, and they're all fun to use and have their own styles of play. For instance, Clive can shoot in both directions at once as a special attack and kick down doors, and Kimmy has an instant kill katana that charges up with every execution she makes. You'll generally end up experimenting with the characters to find your own favourite because they're all effective at getting the job done in the end. The music is also great, having a certain 8-bit chiptune charm to it. Sometimes having a great track in the background helps to relieve the frustation when a ninja manages to slice you in half for the thirtieth run in a row.\n\nThe game does have a few problems though. As likable as the cast is, they aren't particularly well balanced. As mentioned earlier, they're all effective at beating the levels, but some characters are better suited for 100% completion than others. Basically, early characters all have their own special attributes, but a few of the later unlockables have too many strengths and few weaknesses. Mike is especially guilty of this due to his rapid movement speed, powerful shotgun and instant knife execution, which generally allows you to slide tackle entire floors and run back down the corridor stabbing everyone up until the third chapter.\n\nThe humour is also a bit hit and miss. I thought the playable characters had some genuinely funny lines, especially in the character select screen, but BunnyLord himself is too reliant on spouting random things and jamming various words together. In all fairness, his dialogue is randomly generated in places to begin with, but it's sometimes more annoying than amusing because of this. Finally, the game is a bit short. I managed to reach 100% completion in roughly 9 hours of play, although I really enjoyed the time I had with it in the end.\n\nIn short, Not A Hero is a fun, fast paced game that doesn't take itself seriously and is definitely worth a look if its on sale. It has a few issues, but if you're looking for a good action game you could do a lot worse than voting BunnyLord.","May 17","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think they add to the game, but are sometimes frustrating.\n\nIt's nothing particularly novel, but it is fun, and well made.\nWorth buying, if only for the FANTASTIC voice acting.","May 14","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

From the get go you're told by a giant talking purple rabbit from the future to shoot gang members so the British public will elect him as ruler of England and prevent the world from ending. From there on you're sent on 21 missions set in various warehouses and tower blocks, all filled with various thugs and criminals to shoot your way through.\n\nThe gameplay is simple enough: you run through a series of 2D buildings fighting enemies in short, fast-paced battles, using a basic cover mechanic to avoid being shot along the way and regenerate health when necessary. The same cover button can be used to tackle and trip over enemies, leaving them incapacitated for a short while and vulnerable for a stylish execution move. Fallen enemies can occasionally drop special ammo types that last until the next time you reload your weapon. Sometimes these effects are useful, and sometimes they just add a brief special effect to your ammunition, such as flame ammo or disintegration beams. There are also special weapons found in certain places, offering you powerful, limited use attacks for the more difficult sections.\n\nSuccessfully completing missions (and the optional objectives in each one) increases BunnyLord's approval rating. High ratings result in more characters being unlocked, and they're all fun to use and have their own styles of play. For instance, Clive can shoot in both directions at once as a special attack and kick down doors, and Kimmy has an instant kill katana that charges up with every execution she makes. You'll generally end up experimenting with the characters to find your own favourite because they're all effective at getting the job done in the end. The music is also great, having a certain 8-bit chiptune charm to it. Sometimes having a great track in the background helps to relieve the frustation when a ninja manages to slice you in half for the thirtieth run in a row.\n\nThe game does have a few problems though. As likable as the cast is, they aren't particularly well balanced. As mentioned earlier, they're all effective at beating the levels, but some characters are better suited for 100% completion than others. Basically, early characters all have their own special attributes, but a few of the later unlockables have too many strengths and few weaknesses. Mike is especially guilty of this due to his rapid movement speed, powerful shotgun and instant knife execution, which generally allows you to slide tackle entire floors and run back down the corridor stabbing everyone up until the third chapter.\n\nThe humour is also a bit hit and miss. I thought the playable characters had some genuinely funny lines, especially in the character select screen, but BunnyLord himself is too reliant on spouting random things and jamming various words together. In all fairness, his dialogue is randomly generated in places to begin with, but it's sometimes more annoying than amusing because of this. Finally, the game is a bit short. I managed to reach 100% completion in roughly 9 hours of play, although I really enjoyed the time I had with it in the end.\n\nIn short, Not A Hero is a fun, fast paced game that doesn't take itself seriously and is definitely worth a look if its on sale. It has a few issues, but if you're looking for a good action game you could do a lot worse than voting BunnyLord.","May 17","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I call it The Dark Souls Effect: Yes, the game is incredibly hard but not impossible and when you finally succeed it feels very rewarding. And the combat itself is entertaining enough to keep me in.\nSo I tried and tried and tried... and got better. I learned to do the executions properly, I discovered enemy powers and weaknesses, I started counting ammo in my head instead of always looking on the counter.
