Unfortunately, i am giving this 2 out of 5 stars. This game had the potential to be the best open world pirate game, but falls considerably short due tothe many bugs and the lack of any substaintal gameplay content. You just have the main storyline, ship fighting and trading and thats about it. If i thought i could get a refund, i would ask for one. Definitely not worth $50.00.","December 31, 2015","false","32.2"," 274 of 303 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","274","303","5","6"

If you are new to this title, please take that as warning as the store page for "Vendetta" makes no mention of this.   If you would like to see what the original release was like, please see the video linked below (which I made for the original release which has since been Deleted).\n\nI feel really bad for this developer.   They try so hard to fix this mess of a game, but it would have probably been better to just walk away.   Instead, they decided to re-release Raven's cry under a different name and try to pretend it's a different game.   Well, it's not.\n\nThere have been improvements made, which is great, but these could have easily been applied as a patch so it does not justify being renamed and released again.   So why try and release this as a different game?   It's simply a way for them to try and erase their past and all the extremely bad reviews the original release was bombarded with.   Now that all the old reviews are deleted and gone, they have distanced themselves from their failures and are trying again.\n\nThe game still screams "Budget title" with poor vocal talent, terrible animations and glitchy NPCS.   Quests are still boring and the only redeeming feature it has is the ship battles - Just like the original release.\n\nChanges:\n\nChanges have indeed been made, but nothing that warrants a new release.\n\n* NPCS now all have full voicing and don't just go silent with missing vocal tracks.\n* Quests (that I have played so far) are no longer broken and causing the game to be unfinishable.\n* Islands are no longer barren and void of content, and now have random animals to fight\n* Animations have been changed too, but not for the better.   In fact, it seems worse.   Instead of the characters being flat and boring when talking, they now flail their arms around like mad men, over emphasizing gestures to a laughable degree.\n\nBut again... all of this could have been (and should have been) added in a patch.    There are still many bugs with NPCS getting caught on objects and clipping through furniture, twice I had to reload a previous save game and lose my progress, all because I was pushed behind an object that I couldn't get out of.\n\nI might amend this review at a later date, but at 5 hours of gameplay I could never recommend this game to anyone.   If you are oblivious to all the warning signs and really really want to give this a try, then MAYBE wait until the price drops by 80% during a sale.\n\nMaybe.....\n\n\n------\n\nMy experience the first time this game was released:   http://youtu.be/pI_SvrECKIk","November 21, 2015","false","27.8"," 568 of 692 people (82%) found this review helpful 116 people found this review funny","82","568","692","116","43"

Instead those crafty devils at Reality Pump got up to their same old japes, slung a ball of dung at the wall like those new monkeys they added, and insisted a title that could barely run at the same time as Steam's overlay was a high quality masterpiece that you should definitely buy while enthusiastically stating in their forums that things such as a stable framerate are only required by entitled gamers that don't know what they're talking about.\n\nIt truly is one of the most competent incompetent video games I've ever played, I should know because I've played both Ride to Hell and Golden Axe: Beast Rider and it's at least better than those games. But then so is getting my ♥♥♥♥ smashed by a legal dictionary. Don't judge and don't knock it until you try it. Do judge this game though, I think it's kind of a scumbag move you would bury your old reviews then inflate with a bunch of new reviews that insist you got it right this time when half the challenge of the game on the user end is just trying to get the thing to run. I guess I at least gotta give it credit for its juvenile humor that was cool to all of us in high school. Haha, ♥♥♥♥ jokes. Mine's not a joke though, it's pretty huge.

I have had several crashes occur when starting the game and it adds to 'time played' even though I didn't play 2.7 hours of the game. I gave it a fair chance to improve whilst I played and it didn't .\n\nI didn't realise this was just the game 'Raven's Cry' under a different guise which I never bought due to the bad reviews and I can see why now. The game isn't what it made out to be and the controls are poor to say the least , you spend more time messing trying to get camera angles right to make certain turns, especially trying to get up stairs and facing opponents. The combat system in both land and sea are awful and slow. I don't get the 'Blur motion' aspect when you turn and it didn't seem to improve when I changed this in the options menu, why would that be a thing?\n\nThe game overall is very buggy and bad to play, I found that conversations were clippy and sometimes went silent even though other reviewers have not had a problem and music in taverns disappeared when you turned in certain directions. I have seen people fall through walls ... and beds xD.  I expect it would have been better with more time and instead of just re-realising an already existing game , put this back into early access and improve it as although I am not happy to play it at the moment, I can see potential.","November 22, 2015","false","2.7"," 124 of 163 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","124","163","4","0"

Realistically it's like the Drakensang game basically worth c. $30 new release.\n\nWhy?\n\nProduction values are POOR.\n\nAnimations are very stiff. Textures are muddy.  Environmental effects are crap. etc.\n\nVarious simple bugs that should not occur, e.g. crashing simply because the steam overlay is activated.\n\nAny sort of ingame tutorials are iffy, as I caught dialog boxes(info boxes?) apparently appearing and disappearing before I even had a chance to register them.\n\nZuxxez/Topware NEED a STIFF DOSE OF REALITY IMNHO.\n\nThe Witcher games release NEW OUT THE FSCKING DOOR AT a MUCH LOWER price and well even the first DAMNED WITCHER game was MUCH MORE POLISHED AND FUN.\n\nThis is a DUD, UNFORTUNATELY as I REALLY liked their Two Worlds games, and the EARTH RTSes weren't bad, but this much for this stinker?! Nope!\n\n[EDIT]\n\nI don't USUALLY review games, but this one deserves the cake for Ravens Cry and it's assinine pricing, then this one with it's also assinine pricing which was tempered with my APPRECIATION for Two Worlds and tolerance of Earth RTS(I HATE RTS simplistic feeble crap generally) BUT THIS?!  Look at the price and look at the past products, and figure out why I'm thumbing down.\n\n[/edit]\n\n[EDIT2]\nForgot about this since they pulled it for about half the year.  If you want a piratey game check out Sea Dogs: To Each His Own.  There is an English translations available now.  Well since February officially, and 'beta' for a few months prior.  It's based on a heavily modified Age of Pirates 2 engines so it's kind of recent and about 1/5th the price of this steaming pile to boot!\n\nLinux hopefuls, sorry but you're going to have to check for yourself as I gave up mostly on linux gaming years ago back when ports were incredibly overpriced or you got to play with wine trying to make things work.  Too much wasted time. and ATM I don't use linux nearly as much.\n\nThe original Sea Dogs game is also now available on good old games, but that is the VERY OLD original game in the series.  There are some mods for it on piratesahoy.net.\n\nUnless you can get this stinker for <$20USD I heartily recommend letting it walk the plank... which is down from my earlier $30USD estimate as imagine my surprise to find it for sale again with ZERO updates when I had figured either (a) pulled for good(right move) or (b) pulled for more work(less likely as it'd be throwing more good money after bad).  I've also reconsidered Reality Pump's fault as IIRC they had this steaming pile dumped on them from a dev studio that went bankrupt or got shut down and given the poor quality of the visible assets, I imagine that their code is as bad or worse.\n[/edit]","November 24, 2015","false","0.3"," 54 of 81 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","54","81","0","0"

The world is more detailed, the ships are fewer but nicely modeled. Like the old games the sea combat is good, while the land combat is better but a little sluggish. But as the game comes from two worlds 2 it focus more on land than sea exploration, with only 5 types of ships and a sea map like in Seadogs where you indicate where you want but don't see the sailing. The ships has several upgrades that significantly makes them stronger, but the ships can only be bought. You can board but not keep the ships.

I write this review in english, but thats not my native language and I losed a lot since I cant practise it much, but I hope you can understand what I mean.\n\nThis game doesn`t use DRM, you get an CD Key and you can register it to get 2 special weapons but its not a must do like it was with Two Worlds 1+2, an internet connection is not 	required, you can play it offline, you only need one to register your game if you like.\n\nWhat changed?\nWell, honestly I cant see much changes as said, but there are a few, for example graphic looks better a bit, but few cities are still too dark, when you travel to islands like Port Royale or Black Rocks, it looks realy beautiful, much better then on Raven`s Cry. Pups have now more tables and drunken peoples, they are not emty. But a few pups still look like they forgot to place a table in the middle or forgot the lightning because one was realy dark, also there where not addet more Party Games, so you will only finde mini games to make money on 2 or 3 pups, all other didnt had one, what is sad because I realy enjoy making my money in that way then buying food, canabis, alcohol or tee and travel to the countries to sell that for a bit more money then I payed, what makes realy less provite since traveling cost also money and food for your crew. I play this game in german, so I cant tell you if the english voice acting is better then it was on Raven`s Cry but I can tell you, that in german it doesnt match always with voice and mouth movements.\n\nFighting System:\nNew? I´m not sure if its realy new, for me it was better on Raven`s Cry if I remember it well, but I dont realy like it on Vendetta.  Its frustrating when you fight agains 3 or 4 enemies, you have always to escape or run a bit away to see all enemies, the fighting camera is ♥♥♥♥, you can only block 1 enemie at a fight, the camera choose his enemie, you can switch it but its anoying when you fight, also there are often bugs when you try to hit or when you fight standing in water, there is no way to jump backward so he always jumps up. its rare to fight only with 1 enemie they are always to 3 or 4 or more what makes it realy hard and you start to save after every fight. Slow motion finishing is a new thing in this game but I never had one so maybe its only for high skilled pirates, witch make this "new thing" useless,\n\nShip:\nCant see much improvement, Ship is still slow, controlls are okay after you found it out, how it works, you have now free sailing in the game, fights are mixed, sometimes 1 ship sometimes you have to fight agains 3 or 4 ships. There are different levels and Ships, you can upgrade all parts like on Raven`s Cry,\n\nGameplay, Quests and more:\nThe good one is, you can Save your game whenever you like, also the game uses autosave witch can be disabled on settings. You have now more Quests and Characters, what makes the playtime bigger then it was in Raven`s Cry. Details are better now on the Characters too, Enemies drops not always items when they died, also sometimes you get double items, so you have more too sell. There are new Animals who attack you, only the crabs and birds are friendly, so be carefull if you see a monkey or a wild boar. The Map is the same as on Raven`s Cry and the missions I did for now where the same, only reward changed and its a bit harder now to level up. Your Inventory can pick up as many Items as you like, at least it was never full for me and I had a lot of items, weapons and herbs in it. Also you can always run, no matter how full your inventory is.\n\nRating, recommendation and short info:\nIf you liked Raven`s Cry and bought it, then you normaly already owen this Game, if you didn`t played it, give it a try. This Game makes realy fun and its better then Raven`s Cry because they fixed a lot of Bugs and Glitches, also graphic lookes a bit better and you have a lot of hours to finish this game if you do all quests and side quests. For peoples who never played Raven`s Cry but loved games like Risen and Two Worlds give it a try. Since you can now refunde on Steam if you didn`t played more then 2 hours, and the game is worth for you the price, then buy it, you have nothing too lose if you don`t like it after trying it a bit. (refunde it and get your money back).\n\nThis game is not made for everyone, if you never played Two Worlds or Risen (Risen 3 for example is similar), watch a youtube video before buying it.\n\nThis game is an Open World RPG (at least I would call it that), you can travel with a ship, fight with that, upgrade it, buy and sell items, make your owen potions, complete a lot of quests and side quests, spend time on pups, drink an rum, sit to other pirates and listen to there songs or just visit the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ (sex club since steam censore it) and have fun. Its up to you what you like to do, for myselfe, I enjoy this game and I have a lot of fun with it. The price is high but for that playtime you get in this game its a good one.  i would recommand to buy the Digital Deluxe, so you get ~60 minutes of extra quests.\n\nMy rating is a 7 from 10. Would have more points if the fighting system would be better and if all pups had the mini game (and players with more or less money, depending the island you are - poor and rich). And if you would have more dialogues, because they repeat always the same they already said. (when you play the mini game you always hear the same story, its like listen to a song and repeat it after is finished, makes it a bit boring)","November 23, 2015","true","19.9"," 67 of 268 people (25%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","25","67","268","8","17"

I was initially in the negative, but have recently changed my mind after a few more hours offline (I have probably played closer to 5 hours)\n\nYou may ask what changed my mind, well after updating my AMD drivers and replacing a power cable for my HDD I haven't experienced  the same jerkiness and slowness that I was having before even when everything is set to low.\n\nIt's amazing, even though everything else was working fine, something as simple as a power cable and a driver update can make a lot of difference.\n\nUpdate : I had to roll back to 15.11 drivers as the Crimson drivers were causing micro shuttering due to a downclock issue with the driver. The issue has been acknowledged by AMD so wait for a fix\n\nHowever I must warn any potential purchaser and start with\n\nNegatives :\n\nThe game still has some performance issues, but I have found these only occur in the following situations, with the following results and don't impact too negatively on the overall experience.\n\n1. When there are a number of NPCs and you are in a town, bar etc, the frame rate can vary between a buttery smooth 60 and drop to as low as 30 in the first town. In the second town it drops to around 25.\n\nThese drops occur in all towns but are usually outside of combat situations, and are noticable but don't impact the game too much.\n\n2. Ship battles drop below 60 to about 48FPS.\n\n*Regardless of rig or graphical settings these issues have been occurring for people. While some people don't think this is an issue, I'm in the camp where I would much prefer 60 but because the game is no longer jerky and laggy that I can get past these.\n\n3. A few bugs\n\nI had an issue when my saves were taking a while to load, and then it crashed. After reloading it worked fine and fixed my issue I had with the save (I couldn't walk out of the bar, was hovering in mid air and textures were taking a while to load.\n\nThe rollback to 15.11 fixed the textures issue, and after the crash, the save fixed itself.\n\nIf you can get past the negatives then your in for an awesome game.\n\nPros :\n\nSupports 21:9 native - as an owner of an ultrawide it is awesome to be able to play a game without having to do some modifications. The HUD and the game scales correctly to the screen without any issues. In game cutscenes are 21:9 native, the FMVs are 16/9 with black bars.\n\nThe map is 16:9 with black bars, and the inventory screen is also 16/9 with black bars.\n\nThe combat system with ships is fairly simple, but fun. There are 3 different types of cannon balls depending on the damage you want to do and ship battles feel fun and fluid.\n\nThe swordplay is awesome, but does take a bit of getting used to. If your expecting to press attack and just win, well your in for a bad time. You have your basic attack with mouse 1 and block with mouse 2, dodge with space, power attack with E and a special finishing move you can unleash.\n\nThe combat actually requires skill and timing and this can be brutal but I believe fair. Once you work out how to play the game, it is a lot more fun then say the witcher 2 sword combat which is mash the attack button to win.\n\nMixed :\n\nWhile I like the dialogue as it is cheesy and campy, this may not be to everyone's taste.\n\nThere are a few times where sentences tend to roll into one another, or the dialogue inflection isn't quite on point for the dialogue being spoken. There's also a couple of times where I have clicked next to advance the dialogue, but only the next line of text comes up and you have to wait for the dialogue to finish.\n\nIt reminds me in a way of the Witcher 1 dialogue in that it kinda feels like that it was written for another language and would sound better that way.\n\nOn a side note I tried German Audio and English Text - Awesome but the subs don't stay on screen long enough during a cutscene or a scene that automatically advances the spoken dialogue but it is in no way a dealbreaker.\n\nThere are also a few minor bugs but the dev team is working on them. Read the forums for more info.\n\nTo sum up :\n\nI haven't got far enough with the rest of the game to rate the missions and the rest of the game so I will update as I go through.\n\nI hope the devs don't take this the wrong way but with a bit more optimization, a bit more polish and a patch or two to fix bugs and QOL (Quality of Life) issues I would have no problem recommending it without any warnings.\n\nAs it is I am having fun, the game cops a lot of flak (some warranted, some not so) so I would suggest give it a shot, and if you don't like it refund it. You have nothing to lose.","November 25, 2015","true","1.5"," 34 of 165 people (21%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","21","34","165","8","18"

It has great promise but does not always deliver. Yet, still manages to be charming somehow. If you like trading, or wanted a more mature version of Sid Meier's Pirates! then this may be a game you should consider.\n\nAs I said, the game is not perfect. There are still some bugs and the game lacks polish in general. The dialogues are not always coherent for example. I was playing this game in Linux and did face a few problems in version 1.03. The game would crash at graphics at maximum. This problem disappeared when I turned down the settings a bit.\n\nEdit: Apparently there are people who have nothing better to do with their lives than to dispute game reviews. Considering the population of 12 year olds online that should not be surprising, nevertheless I was surprised when people started adding me as friends to tell me that I was a sell out because I liked this game.

I love it :)\n\n-ships and sea battles. Here the game truly shines. Depending on the weather everything changes: sometimes in the fog you are fighting blind, in high seas it's difficult to aim etc. You hear the orders being given, sailors scream when the ship gets hit-it's quite realistic. And all this management stuff-officers, upgrades,different types of ammo-it's not only for show-all those things do matter. For example: once I was chased by a more powerful ship-I was able to escape because I damaged its sails. Another one: good gunmaster and some skill points will make your crew reload cannons almost twice as fast as your enemies, and sometimes one second means the difference between life and death.\n\n-beautiful locations. It's winter here in Poland(no snow today, but it's cold)-and I feel like I was on vacation in the Caribbean :)\n\n-Raven-the bird. Great idea. He can bring you things (I secretly freed a prisoner because the bird brought me the keys to the cell) and distract or attack your enemies. And he will help fill your budget ;)\n\n-fighting system. It is difficult (I've stopped counting how many times I've died...)-but, once you learn to dodge and block and once you unlock kicks and hook-it becomes enjoyable.\n\n\nCons:\n\n-bugs (some graphics issues, some bad lipsyncs, but no crashes in my case)-nothing a patch (or two...) won't fix.\n\n-sometimes I find the voice acting and NPCs behavior strange: someone is talking in a friendly manner but he's flailing like he wants to hit me in the face.\n\n-dice poker. I loved it in the Witcher. Here I don't. It looks weird.\n\nConclusion: Vendetta probably won't make it to the top 10 RPGs of all time-but if you like ships and pirates give it a try :) I did-and I don't regret this decision :)","November 26, 2015","true","25.8"," 27 of 144 people (19%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","19","27","144","4","14"

Furthermore the damage decreases movement or turning speed and if crewmembers die, the reloading time for cannons takes longer.\n\nThe boarding is very strategic and looks a bit turn based. You have the option to either continue using cannons damaging the vessel further or let your crew use their swords. After boarding is complete you have to decide which goods you take on board, if you have no space you can drop things you are currently not in need for.\n\nDepending on what faction you attacked you just made some good friends while got on someone else´s shitlist\n\nThere are different types of crewmembers. The officers you can chose from have advantages and disadvantages.\nYour first officer Donovan for example may proof not to be too efficient in boarding but is a great sailor as his men are able to improve your ships speed. You can hire your base crew in every harbor but of course they need to be paid and fed. If the morale is high the crew will make your life easier.\n\nThe changes you do to your ship by either upgrading it or equipping it with figureheads, sails and other things are not only changing it visually but also change the stats of it. You have to decide if you rather spend the time and invest a lot of money in your current vessel or obtain the next ship as soon as possible..\n\nI love the AI in this game as the enemy acts intelligent\n\n\nMan to man combat:\nWhile I got used to naval combat fast, it takes me a lot of practice to master Chris's swordsmanship (opposed to gunnery).\n\nIt would have been nice if there had been a bigger tutorial mode.\nAt the beginning which had let you practice a bit more with the different types of weapons you can use and how to target the enemies.\nHowever the quicksave function becomes very handy in here since you can save almost everywhere.\nYou also can heal yourself by using potions.\n\nYou have to be careful where to draw your sword or where you send your raven to steal as nearby people will attack you.\nGetting surrounded leads you into serious trouble and results in a fast but painful death which makes it again very strategic as you have to pay close attention where and whom you fight.\nRemember that sometimes it is wise to redraw for a moment rather than cut your way through because Chris is not a one man army.\n\nI also have to mention that the AI here is again intelligent and will in fact be able to either protect himself and might give you a little support. The enemy currently needs to learn how to circle obstacles.\n\nI enjoyed the idea a lot to include a raven into the battle system as it is a really cool ally for a pirate and his skills become very useful.\n\nIf you have a gamepad controls might be a bit easier compared to the keyboard.\n\n\nStory\n\nI will not say much about the story since I do not want to spoiler anything and it might depend on taste.\nThe story is not linear and it has several endings and a different progression is possible which adds plenty of replay value.\nI enjoyed the character design and the voice cast.\n\nFinal words\n\nThere are a few bugs in game which I will write on a list and sent to the team but I am sure that the developers are going to fix them. Everyone can see that the staff is present if one visits the forum.\nIn my opinion the quest log needs some fine tuning as I sometimes have trouble to find out if a quest is in fact done or if there is still something left to do. The interface could be a bit prettier too.\n\nVendetta delivers a lot of fun and interaction no matter if you play story quests, side quests or join mini games such as dice games etc.\nI already have 35 hours on my playtime but certainly I will make it 200 in the near future. I would also recommend this to every of my friends who is into the pirate theme and naval combat.\nIf you want to find out more about this game why not contact me or watch my broadcast?","November 30, 2015","true","128.6"," 38 of 179 people (21%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","21","38","179","7","9"

This greatly affected my experience of the game and my recommendation. For a pirate ship game I expected to capture ships or at the very least, take over a ship I boarded. This game makes you go to different islands to find a person that is willing to sell you a different ship class, and this is the only way to change you ship. The schooner ship I got by killing a captain in the beginning does not count to my personal achievements because that was not a "Purchase." Even the old game Seadogs let you get a few first officers to capture boarded ships, command a fleet, and you could also switch ships after boarding. I can say that this game is good if you ignore glitches/errors in quests and lighting/camera/frame rate issues.\n\nThings I like about this game:\n+ The Cursing\n+ The Sexy Women\n+ Ship Battles\n+ The right amount of weapons and upgrades\n+ Dice Game & Raven pet (great ways to make money)\n\nThings I hated about this game:\n- Can't Capture Ships nor switch ships after boarding, and no Fleet\n- When boarding you do not fight on deck of the ship with your sword and guns like in most good pirate games\n- The steam interface seems to lock up the game for me.\n- Tutorial windows pop up and go away really quickly (they should pause time and let you read it)\n- Animals are a pain in the you know what and I find myself standing on them all the time.\n- You cannot just sail and look around your ship without being in a fight.\n- No spyglass\n\nThings need to be improved:\n/ Sword fighting can be better, maybe make block last longer (you get better at sword fighting with practice)\n/ The world traveling map where you need to press Y to pause time and select a nearby ship to attack or city to visit should be a little slower. Maybe adding the word "New!" near the just opened island or area for a quest to make it easier.\n/ They should have more mini games like poker and throwing knifes like in Quest for Glory 5 and make sure to have NPC voices in the background does not loop the same talk over and over again.\n/ There should be fast travel in the city.\n/ Having only one area that takes you back on the ship from an island is not good for some quests. Adding multiple areas around the island where you could go back on the ship quickly would make the game quicker and more fun.\n/ When a bartender shows you a officer to hire it would be great to see your current officer side by side to compare.\n/The quest logs should have a city name of where the quest needs to be done (on each quest).\n/ I do not like to see old quest characters that are highlighted on my map they should be removed after the quest is completed and the items like old maps in the inventory should also be automatically removed when a quest is finished.\n\nThis game is better than the Org. Raven's Cry (but changing the game a little and making it like a new game was a wrong thing to do, just don't rush a game out next time) but still needs a lot of work to make it great. The game has errors like one time I could not go to any island (it would crash my game every time I tired) and had to restart an old saved game to fix the issue. Another error I had was when I docked in the city and my ship was sunk by the time I got back to it. Save on 6 or more different slots to be safe in this game.\n\nThis game gets a 7/10 but if they fix the bugs and change a few things above, it will be an easy 10.","December 15, 2015","true","56.8"," 26 of 143 people (18%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","18","26","143","6","5"

Reading about how buggy the game was on initial release, I decided to hold off on playing it pending the release of additional patches/bug-fixes promised by the developer. As it turns out, the developer made good on their word and released this updated version of the game, with a slightly different title.\n\nI'm glad that the developers followed through with finishing the game and I'm also glad I waited to play this updated version, as it has turned out to be very enjoyable.\n\nThe updated Raven's Cry (this game) ended up coming out around the same time as Fallout 4, and costing about the same price. In my opinion, Raven's Cry is much more deserving of the 60-dollar price than Fallout 4. Whereas I found Fallout 4 to be unengaging and a regurgitation of its predecessors, I find Raven's Cry fun to play, with entertaining character conversations (actually, a lot of the writing is really intelligent and some - though not all - of the voice acting is really good) and a fun mix of naval combat and over-the-shoulder third-person gameplay.\n\nThis game, as I hoped it to be, is like a mix of Two Worlds II land-based action-RPG with Sid Meier's Pirates!-style navigation and ship-to-ship combat. It's fun.","December 6, 2015","true","61.2"," 12 of 99 people (12%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","12","12","99","5","7"

The melee combat is slightly sluggish and unresponsive, but can be enjoyable. The best part is the exploration, the game has some interesting Islands that you can freely explore and find hidden treasures. The graphics are moody and athomspherical with a good shadow and lighting system. The game can look really good in the sunlight.","December 7, 2015","true","10.4"," 12 of 101 people (12%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","12","12","101","2","0"

RC is pirate themed RPG with integrated shipfights.\nIf you wanted to buy parkour with shipfights AC4 clone, look elsewhere.\n\nRaven's Cry plays totally like Sea Dogs and it's sequels and spinoffs:\nSea Dogs (2000)\nPirates of the Caribbean (2003)\nAge of Pirates: Caribbean Tales (2006)\nAge of Pirates 2: City of Abandoned Ships (2009)\n\nAnd it seems totally inspired by those as they share:\n- superb music\n- clunky groundcombat with horrible opponents AI ;)\n- totally fun ship fights\n\nDifferences?\nUnlike Sea Dogs and the rest, you can't "improve" skills of your ship officers in Raven's Cry - skills they have by default never change. This is not a bad decision IMO as keeps you away from grinding since RC sidekicks don't really have BlackIsleish background story to share. At least not in this game, maybe in eventiual sequel...\nAlso you can't make a fleet and lead it in Raven's Cry (apart from friendlies that temporarily join your side during some quests). Another good choice as in Sea Dogs you could build an OP fleet and pwn everything.\n\nIf you're not sure what to think, you can test your taste with DRMfree Sea Dogs available on GOG.\n\nTo this day I don't know why critics panned it so hard. I've seen many games in my life and some definetly deserved 1/10, but this one totally didn't. And critics were showering the game with that score calling out whatever unforgivable issues seems only them had - not only nonexisting bugs (as I collected reports and posted a buglist in original game) but also issues related to the game story (slavery for example) like all of them expected kill_noone and remain politically correct Superman game and not an evil pirate in the era where political correctness was a fairy tale.\n\nOne thing I can say for sure.\nUnlike (usually) overhyped visual candy I've played this year, mainly AC:Unity and FarCry4 where I uninstalled without ever finishing those because of utter boredom, I've finished original Raven's Cry twice without getting bored anywhere and now am on it for the third time in this Enhanced Edition, and again not bored to death like with grindy and repetitive modern mainstream games.\n\nEnhanced Edition aka Vendetta corrected voiceover issue, added containers to make exploration more fruitful (although new added animals are over the top on half of islands), added hats as a new statbooster, introduced a crapload of new sidequests with some brilliant solutions to lack of humor in the original game (the bordello goat for example).\nWhile earning $ perhaps became too easy after you obtain the second (better than schooner) ship, it doesn't steal anything from the game as now you can enjoy shipfhighs without thinking if you'll have enough of cash for later ship repairs.","December 18, 2015","true","37.8"," 11 of 98 people (11%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","11","11","98","3","3"

If you like Risen or Two Worlds series, then you will love this game. Since the original Raven's cry they improved on many things. They fixed the audio, graphics and glitches. There are not to many studios out there that are willing to go through the trouble of fixing there games to the extent that reality pump has done and i just wanted to say good job to them and keep up the solid work. The game runs smooth on ultra at 1080p with my Nvidia GTX 970.
