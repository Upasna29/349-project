Rusty hearts has nice simplistic graphics with a comfortable gearing system. On each stage you can choose your own desired difficulty and playthrough the game according to your standards. You can choose easy, to hack and slash away at enemies no ease OR choose the highest difficulty and engage in a challenging game. If you are a fan of games that look simliar to anime, you should definetly play Rust Hearts! The only problem is, this game is being shut down in September.

This fast-paced game allows you to play as four different characters (well, 8 now) with each having unique attacks and abilities. There's a vast amount of weapons (no two weapons are alike), armour, quests, enemies, and skills and a great Player vs Player mode where you can test your skills against other players. You can even dress up your character with clothing bought from the cash shop that have random buffs like +30 fire damage or such.

You can choose easy, to hack and slash away at enemies no ease OR choose the highest difficulty and engage in a challenging game. If you are a fan of games that look simliar to anime, you should definetly play Rust Hearts! The only problem is, this game is being shut down in September.

The story is quite good, I enjoyed my whole time playing it (ever since Closed Beta). Of course, the game has some flaws, bugs, etc., but for the most part it's pretty good and it doesn't deserve what PWE did to it.\nNo content released for more than a year, no updates, no advertising, the game was basically forgotten, which led to a lot of players leaving the game.\n\nNow this game, that was supposed to be amazing will be shutting down it's servers in Semptember (2014). I'm pretty sure there's still a lot of people that still like this game for what it was during closed beta, friendly users, new content, simple but cool graphics and a nice gameplay.\n\nBesides all that I said, I'm not gonna recommend this game, since it'll be down in less than 2 months from now...\n\nPS: If you're still playing this game today, and is bidding farewell to it (just like me) feel free to add me on steam or in game so we can probably say our goodbyes to this game...

It falls a little bit short in the graphics category, but it 'is' an Anime based game after all.\nWhat really makes this game fun for me is the play style. Side view free movement style combat with lots of freedom to move and place yourself tactically to get the most dmg output without taking damage. It even comes with a handy ranking system to rate how you did, from\n\nSSS: Best rank\nSS: Second best rank\nS: Great rank\nA: Good rank\nB: Mediocre Rank\nC: On the edge rank\nD: Failed rank\nF: Dismal failure\n\nThe only downside to this game is that the Development Team is from (im)Perfect World Entertainment, the same people who made Star Trek Online and turned it from a promising RP friendly MMO, into a Box crazed "YU BUY KEY 4 BOX NAO MIGHT GET BIG FANCEH SHIP DAT IZ BETTURH DEN UDDER SHIPZ!!!"...Aka a P2W(Pay to Win) disgrace. Imperfect World has their entire effort focused almost entirely on their money cow, STO, and therefor, they've already announced long ago that they will not be delivering any further updates/patches/bug fixes to Rusty Hearts...The game is as is, and stays as is. This has caused a dramatic drop in players, and I am level 11 and have yet to experience a group. The group roster is constantly empty, and the PvP roster is hardly even worth looking at, NO ONE uses it. I can only hope that you 'graduate' into the more populated areas later, but as I write this, I am saddened by how few people play this game, as it is extremely innovative, and deserves so much more than the despicable treatment Imperfect World is giving this marvelous game.\n\nIt is deffinitely recommended by me, and I hope dearly that people will come and play it with me :)","March 2, 2014","true","2.5"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","20","24","0","0"

I tried playing with both controller and a little bit with the keyboard and the best is probably if you have a controller to play with. It seems like it's kinda emulates the controller with the keyboard, for example instead of using the joystick on the controller to walk around, you use the arrow keys. I usually don't play these kinda games with a keyboard, so it just felt really weird to me. Might feel better for people used to play with a keybaord, I dunno. You also get a lot of spells, which can be kinda hard to execute with a controller, for example, when you get your 4 first skills they are set on LB, RB, LT and RT. When you get your 5th skill you press B+LT to use it. I just end up not using them very often.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, but it fits. The texture quality and resulotion could be a lot higher. It looks really pixelated and bad when the camera zooms into stuff.\n\nThe difficulty settings are really weird as well. I only tried playing with a friend and at least in the beginning of the game, even the hardest difficulty which recommends 3-4 players is completed with ease when we are 2. I hope it becomes more difficult later on...\n\nThis games gets 7/10, really fun, but some stuff is just really weird, but hey, it's free!\n\nAnd now for those who had some problems with the game:\n\nBoth me and my friend got stuck in the launcher and got patch errors. To fix this, first close the launcher, then go to your Rusty Hearts installation and open a program called "MPatcher.exe". Let it check the stuff and then run the launcher again, this time use patch 2 with the little check box. Let it verify and it should run.\n\nIf you get an DirectX error while trying to run the game, go to your installation folder of Rusty Hearts and there should be a folder with the name of "DirectX_*", for example mine was namned "DirectX_Jun_2010". Open that and run "DXSETUP.exe". Then start the game again and it should work.\n\nAlso, the last problem I got, was trying to log in. I got Error 14 and the game closed. To fix this, instead of creating an account in the launcher, create it while in the game on the login screen. There should be a button to register an account there.\n\nThat's all!

I tried playing with both controller and a little bit with the keyboard and the best is probably if you have a controller to play with. It seems like it's kinda emulates the controller with the keyboard, for example instead of using the joystick on the controller to walk around, you use the arrow keys. I usually don't play these kinda games with a keyboard, so it just felt really weird to me. Might feel better for people used to play with a keybaord, I dunno. You also get a lot of spells, which can be kinda hard to execute with a controller, for example, when you get your 4 first skills they are set on LB, RB, LT and RT. When you get your 5th skill you press B+LT to use it. I just end up not using them very often.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, but it fits. The texture quality and resulotion could be a lot higher. It looks really pixelated and bad when the camera zooms into stuff.\n\nThe difficulty settings are really weird as well. I only tried playing with a friend and at least in the beginning of the game, even the hardest difficulty which recommends 3-4 players is completed with ease when we are 2. I hope it becomes more difficult later on...\n\nThis games gets 7/10, really fun, but some stuff is just really weird, but hey, it's free!\n\nAnd now for those who had some problems with the game:\n\nBoth me and my friend got stuck in the launcher and got patch errors. To fix this, first close the launcher, then go to your Rusty Hearts installation and open a program called "MPatcher.exe". Let it check the stuff and then run the launcher again, this time use patch 2 with the little check box. Let it verify and it should run.\n\nIf you get an DirectX error while trying to run the game, go to your installation folder of Rusty Hearts and there should be a folder with the name of "DirectX_*", for example mine was namned "DirectX_Jun_2010". Open that and run "DXSETUP.exe". Then start the game again and it should work.\n\nAlso, the last problem I got, was trying to log in. I got Error 14 and the game closed.

I tried playing with both controller and a little bit with the keyboard and the best is probably if you have a controller to play with. It seems like it's kinda emulates the controller with the keyboard, for example instead of using the joystick on the controller to walk around, you use the arrow keys. I usually don't play these kinda games with a keyboard, so it just felt really weird to me. Might feel better for people used to play with a keybaord, I dunno. You also get a lot of spells, which can be kinda hard to execute with a controller, for example, when you get your 4 first skills they are set on LB, RB, LT and RT. When you get your 5th skill you press B+LT to use it. I just end up not using them very often.\n\nThe graphics aren't the best, but it fits. The texture quality and resulotion could be a lot higher. It looks really pixelated and bad when the camera zooms into stuff.\n\nThe difficulty settings are really weird as well. I only tried playing with a friend and at least in the beginning of the game, even the hardest difficulty which recommends 3-4 players is completed with ease when we are 2. I hope it becomes more difficult later on...\n\nThis games gets 7/10, really fun, but some stuff is just really weird, but hey, it's free!\n\nAnd now for those who had some problems with the game:\n\nBoth me and my friend got stuck in the launcher and got patch errors. To fix this, first close the launcher, then go to your Rusty Hearts installation and open a program called "MPatcher.exe". Let it check the stuff and then run the launcher again, this time use patch 2 with the little check box. Let it verify and it should run.\n\nIf you get an DirectX error while trying to run the game, go to your installation folder of Rusty Hearts and there should be a folder with the name of "DirectX_*", for example mine was namned "DirectX_Jun_2010". Open that and run "DXSETUP.exe". Then start the game again and it should work.\n\nAlso, the last problem I got, was trying to log in. I got Error 14 and the game closed. To fix this, instead of creating an account in the launcher, create it while in the game on the login screen. There should be a button to register an account there.\n\nThat's all! Have fun!","August 1, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It doesn't have that authentic Japanese anime feel. As of this writing I encountered lots of annoying stuff like the bloom effect covering the names of the characters in the select screen, text pass by too quickly and most of the time the game will scroll the dailogue for you, default control scheme is annoying, and subpar voice acting.\n\nThe combat system feels like a semi-automated version of Devil May Cry 3's combat system. It's not bad and it's actually the best part of the game. Recommended? No. If you want to try it out, don't expect too much. It's F2P after all.","October 9, 2011","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I stopped playing shortly after they released Natasha. Played as her for a little bit, and then stopped playing. Due to time constraints and playing another mmo.\nThe game then was alright. It was a great way to kill time, but it would get a little tedious at times. You had crafting, tons of quests, tons of monsters to kill, three classes to choose from, and even a cash shop. If you felt like dumping some money into the game.\n\nThis time around - I had to fight with the launcher for two days before finally getting the game to boot. The patcher would always get stuck on the same file no matter what I did, and then it wouldn't open back up if I tried to open the launcher after the failed patch. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game umpteen amount of times, deleting files, verify integrity of the game, etc etc. I finally get the launcher to fully patch. I get the game working, but with massive bugs trying to get the exe to boot. When I finally get to the login screen, and I try to log in and it keeps telling me my username and password are incorrect even though i've been using this account since the game was released - I created the account specifically for this game. I know my username and password cause I just logged into the website, and I was JUST playing Torchlight 2 with it.\nThis game has been out since September 2011, and it has this many bugs? That's ridiculous!\n\nIf you can get past all of the bull with the launcher, and the login screen. The game is decent. It's a good way to kill time.\n\nThe reason why i'm not recommending this game is for several reasons.\n- After the initial download of 2gigs on Steam. You still have to download a patch which takes a while, and gives an error which sometimes causes the launcher to redownload the entire patch. -\n- The launcher is bugged -\n- The log in screen wont recognize my username or password. -\n- According to a lot of forum posts, the player base is dwindling.

I stopped playing shortly after they released Natasha. Played as her for a little bit, and then stopped playing. Due to time constraints and playing another mmo.\nThe game then was alright. It was a great way to kill time, but it would get a little tedious at times. You had crafting, tons of quests, tons of monsters to kill, three classes to choose from, and even a cash shop. If you felt like dumping some money into the game.\n\nThis time around - I had to fight with the launcher for two days before finally getting the game to boot. The patcher would always get stuck on the same file no matter what I did, and then it wouldn't open back up if I tried to open the launcher after the failed patch. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling the game umpteen amount of times, deleting files, verify integrity of the game, etc etc. I finally get the launcher to fully patch. I get the game working, but with massive bugs trying to get the exe to boot. When I finally get to the login screen, and I try to log in and it keeps telling me my username and password are incorrect even though i've been using this account since the game was released - I created the account specifically for this game. I know my username and password cause I just logged into the website, and I was JUST playing Torchlight 2 with it.\nThis game has been out since September 2011, and it has this many bugs? That's ridiculous!\n\nIf you can get past all of the bull with the launcher, and the login screen. The game is decent. It's a good way to kill time.\n\nThe reason why i'm not recommending this game is for several reasons.\n- After the initial download of 2gigs on Steam. You still have to download a patch which takes a while, and gives an error which sometimes causes the launcher to redownload the entire patch. -\n- The launcher is bugged -\n- The log in screen wont recognize my username or password. -\n- According to a lot of forum posts, the player base is dwindling. Making leveling harder / impossible in later levels -\n\nTL;DR - Don't bother with this game.

One of the starting conversations is as follows:\n\n"I can still taste your blood in my mouth, it flows through my veins ,and covers my heart in rust"\n"Can you hear me?"\n"WHAT?! I must have feel asleep ,Ooomph"\n"Did you fall asleep again?"\n"Hunh? What do you mean?"\n"HMPH, I don't like to repeat myself"\n"Got it, I'll clear Canal B2 quick as flash!"\n\nIt just doesn't make sense. The game starts off with a semi-nice prolouge, then just gives up and says "smack ♥♥♥♥ up".\n\nthe controls are wonky at times, even using a gamepad. The button layout can't be changed, the guard button is a trigger on xbox controllers, which is awkward since the B button is unused at all, meaning you get one less skill button and one awkwardly placed button for an action you kind of actually NEED at some points.","March 6, 2014","true","4.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm thumbing this down because Perfect World Entertainment is either too lazy or too incompetent to fix the login error. I've tried everything to get this game to work; and all the play time you see (1.9 hours as I'm typing) all went into downloading, patching, deleting since it wouldn't work before, redownloading and repatching, and finally trying everything I could to be able to log into the game. Last time it wouldn't download completely and now it won't let me log in with my current account nor with the account I just created and made no changes to. It's very pathetic that this game has been out for quite some time and is still broken. So I cannot recommend it because of this fact; but hopefully at some point I'll find a way to make it work. But it shouldn't be this difficult and I know I'm not alone on the problem.","May 21, 2014","false","1.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

And it's one of those Free to Play ones, with a cash shop.  There are so many reasons I could easily NOT recommend this.  However, I am recommending it, I love the game.  The storyline is amusing, the characters are unique, the gameplay is awesome, and playing barbie with the characters is neat, even if you have to pay real life money for some of the nice looking costumes.  I have yet to find a single item in the cash shop that I *needed*.  The game is particularly easy in the beginning, being able to fly through Very Hard mode.  However, it gets harder, to the point where Normal mode becomes somewhat of a challenge.  Also, many of the first dungeouns are very linear, that changes as well.  The dungeouns change as you progress through the storyline as well, as does the NPCs and such.  The group leader also has full control of what dungeoun and difficulty you run at, and it's based on the content the the group leader has unlocked.","November 4, 2011","true","90.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I see pvp as its majour strongpoint, the precise controls and the varied characters tied with their  unique playstyles, you are given a fantastic, fast paced brawler with an extremely high skill level.\n\n{EDIT} after joining this game a year later, i have found the pvp lobbies empty and desolate, unfortunately the towns arent as populated as they used to be and it seems the once great community is dieing out...","March 3, 2013","true","29.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you ever manage to fully download this god awful game, with its absolutely terrible anti-cheat system, manage to go through 100 suggestions on google until you finally find a fix that works, then manage to figure out the mensa-IQ-test style login system, to finally create an account, using an email address, a login name, and an account name, all three of them to log into different parts of the game, then you're atleast halfway there, the next half that'll cause you to smash your fist through the computer screen is with an unfixable [Failed to verify account] error, that'll just pop up even when you enter your account details perfectly on the game's log in screen, it'll simply shut down your game and lock you out, and the moderators and help team wont even bother to assist you, they have better things to do than what they are paid to do, clearly. I was really hoping this game would work, but it's just as bad as it used to be, impossible to play, and already on my list of worst games ever. Quite near the top, actually.

Shoot yourself instead.","January 14, 2014","false","1.8"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

The unholy lovechild of Devil May Cry and Castlevania. Pick up a skeleton, punch it the face (skull?) and then throw it into a group of other skeletons and just ♥♥♥♥ing stomp the ♥♥♥♥ outta them. The music is great (sounds very Castlevania-y!), the combo system flows like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed river, and the writing is actually genuinely clever and funny. The only real flaws that i can see are that the voice clips in cut scenes seem to get messed up and overlap each other sometimes, but that's a very minor flaw. The cash shop isn't as bad as in other games, either: while costume items bought via cash do give you some random, minor stat bonuses, it's not really enough to give you a huge edge. There are also several craftable costumes in-game, though it might take some time to get them. Either way, you won't really feel bad about spending some bucks on this, because hey, it's fun. Or at least it was when i played it ages ago. Who knows anymore.","November 18, 2011","true","73.1"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

This fast-paced game allows you to play as four different characters (well, 8 now) with each having unique attacks and abilities. There's a vast amount of weapons (no two weapons are alike), armour, quests, enemies, and skills and a great Player vs Player mode where you can test your skills against other players. You can even dress up your character with clothing bought from the cash shop that have random buffs like +30 fire damage or such.

Rusty hearts has nice simplistic graphics with a comfortable gearing system. On each stage you can choose your own desired difficulty and playthrough the game according to your standards. You can choose easy, to hack and slash away at enemies no ease OR choose the highest difficulty and engage in a challenging game. If you are a fan of games that look simliar to anime, you should definetly play Rust Hearts! The only problem is, this game is being shut down in September. Hopefully another game provider can pick up this game and find success.\n\nThe Pros:\n-Unique characters\n-Nice Animations\n-Great Soundtrack\n-Easily obtainable equipment\n-Each stage has dungeon difficulty adjustments\n-Voice acting isn't bad at all\n-Great costumes and customizations\n-Big bosses\n-Hack and slash button mashing\n\nThe Cons:\n- Leaning towards the typical MMORPG? (Kinda/Maybe?)\n\nI honestly don't have much to complain about this game, it is a great game. It's just it does have the stereotypical elements of a MMORPG game which might bother people who desire a more unique game.","August 18, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It seems like it's kinda emulates the controller with the keyboard, for example instead of using the joystick on the controller to walk around, you use the arrow keys. I usually don't play these kinda games with a keyboard, so it just felt really weird to me. Might feel better for people used to play with a keybaord, I dunno.

As of this writing I encountered lots of annoying stuff like the bloom effect covering the names of the characters in the select screen, text pass by too quickly and most of the time the game will scroll the dailogue for you, default control scheme is annoying, and subpar voice acting.\n\nThe combat system feels like a semi-automated version of Devil May Cry 3's combat system. It's not bad and it's actually the best part of the game. Recommended? No. If you want to try it out, don't expect too much. It's F2P after all.","October 9, 2011","false","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's not necessarily diverse but it looks great. Unlike a lot of game the free content allows you to customize your character to that you don't look like every other player. Though that is if you actually try to use that feature. The weapons and fighting are fluid and have a balanced speed. The monsters are well designed and can give you a challenge at times. The sound track is absolutely amazing; I can listen to it all day.\n\nDislikes: The game is completely dependent on dungeon grinding, the quest and everything require dungeons. Even so they're short and don't really give much variety to the game. In the beginning it was okay but it gets boring very fast. The fighting is fluid but combos and such are pretty much non-existing giving the game a very stale and repetitive feeling. The quests are the same. Go into the dungeon, kill all the monsters, and get your reward after. The majority of the time you have to go into the same dungeon at a different difficulty; however they're completely easy. The voice acting is terrible. They layer over each other multiple times and start before even characters are finished talking. The movement of the characters are completely limited to the direction of the dungeon, other than the free roam in the plazas you do completely nothing. The story line becomes completely irrelevant after the first few cutscenes and it just goes on to missions that don't even help with figuring it out.\n\nMy rating: 5.5/10","July 3, 2014","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There were radio buttons saying patch 1 and patch 2. I don't know what that was about. Anyway, I read that the patch was about 500 MB so it shouldn't take that long. But nope, it took hours for some reason. And finally when it reached 99%, there was an error. So I restarted the patch and after finishing that patch, there was another unique patch. It had a different UI so I was patching for something else in the game that wasn't the game, apparently.\n\nFinally, after I got into the actual game, I was intrigued by the music as well as the GUI. I tried entering my credentials but was met with an incorrect username and password pop-up box. And so I tried 2 or 3 more times of which I am sure I entered correctly, only to be met with that same box. After one more try, it gave me an error saying 'failed to verify, error 14' and it closed the game. Still frustrated from the patching, I searched the web for a solution. I did not find one. Seeing forums posts originating from 2 years ago with no resolution does little to rekindle my enthusiasm. I gave up. Keep in mind that I tried several times.\n\nThis is my personal experience and one that I'm sure are shared with other people. Take it as it is.","February 5, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of MMOs and want to try something new, this would be one of those games for you.","December 29, 2013","true","69.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the mosters spawn in a similar way of rising out of the ground from a portal. End of dungeon boss fights are "meh" and can be finished with a simple skill spam, dash to dodge, and repeat. Major battle though have that DMC feel to it, that you have to see some pattern, use some surrounding tool, wait for the right moment, etc just to kill the boss.\n\nWhat is a put off though is the bad camera angle which forces you to look in certain directions in the dungeon. Sometimes, there are NPC chats within the dungeon itself  which hinder your fighting - if you dont spam that spacebar or esc button fast enough,  you leave yourself wide open for attack "hidden" by these huge chats.\n\nThe game is not bad. 6.5 / 10","September 26, 2011","true","8.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wouldnt really mind it but I always end up disableing something when I change the binds around. This game also affects my Alienware FX making my keyboard change color every time I click a key so when I walk around my keyboard is rapidly changing colors and its ♥♥♥♥ing annoying.. Anyways.. about the good things about the game.. hmmm... I can't really think of anything.Other than the japanese verson on the game being 10x better, Why is that? you may ask well.. first of all its updated and may even still be getting updated.\nI may update this review once I find something of interest.","March 2, 2014","false","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's not necessarily diverse but it looks great. Unlike a lot of game the free content allows you to customize your character to that you don't look like every other player. Though that is if you actually try to use that feature. The weapons and fighting are fluid and have a balanced speed. The monsters are well designed and can give you a challenge at times. The sound track is absolutely amazing; I can listen to it all day.\n\nDislikes: The game is completely dependent on dungeon grinding, the quest and everything require dungeons. Even so they're short and don't really give much variety to the game. In the beginning it was okay but it gets boring very fast. The fighting is fluid but combos and such are pretty much non-existing giving the game a very stale and repetitive feeling. The quests are the same. Go into the dungeon, kill all the monsters, and get your reward after. The majority of the time you have to go into the same dungeon at a different difficulty; however they're completely easy. The voice acting is terrible. They layer over each other multiple times and start before even characters are finished talking. The movement of the characters are completely limited to the direction of the dungeon, other than the free roam in the plazas you do completely nothing. The story line becomes completely irrelevant after the first few cutscenes and it just goes on to missions that don't even help with figuring it out.\n\nMy rating: 5.5/10","July 3, 2014","false","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Especially one that restricts the characters you use.  But I am really glad I did.  It's as if castlevania became an MMO, and actually did it right.  Dynamic combat, easy to grasp controls, toggleable difficulty, easy to understand crafting system, the list goes on!  And with it being a free game, they don't play around with you and charge you to go to special areas, the only thing they charge for are items you don't really need!  So why not give it a try?

The graphics are visually stunning cell-shaded anime style, with real time hack and slash combat reminiscent of Devil May Cry. The music is superb and so relaxing to listen to, while amping you up during combat and key points. Though the dungeons are rather linear with very little options of free roaming, everything else in the game makes up for it. There are very few areas that needed some work (e.g. some of the dialogue is improper and grammatically incorrect for those that speak English, and for me it seemed like the dialogue in the cut-scenes overlapped eachother 90% of the time making it hard to read along, but my only other complaint is that the game lags at certain points like at the end of a dungeon after killing the boss and waiting for the stats screen to pop up where it shows you how many monsters you killed, what your rank was, how much experience you earned, etc.) But other than that I really can't find any flaws in this game other than the simple fact that it is slowly dying. They still do server maintanance every week which is nice, but there hasn't been any BIG updates to the game in a long time, and nobody really cares about the auction house. You'd be lucky to find 4-5 weapons period out of all of the different types. It seems like the majority of the people that play this game are people who have been playing it since it first came out so there is a lot of veteran players to run into, so making friends and getting accepted into a guild was a rather speedy process and helped make my experience much more enjoyable. I've been hopelessly addicted to this game for the past few weeks. I am having entirely too much fun.","April 28, 2014","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are highly stylised, which probably boils down to personal preference, it certainly isn't mine. The heavy cel-shading makes every model lack detail and feature and it feels as though I'd be able to play it on my Gameboy. Speaking of which, the gameplay is sort of like Devil May Cry, mostly because of the overexaggerating combat á la wield a sword that's almost your own size, catapult enemies into the air and pummel them there for like a minute. Typical action-JRPG stuff. As far as characters go this game boasts exactly four. There's no customisation whatsoever, you choose one of four existing chars (Boobarella, Some Whimp, Some chick, Whimp with katana) and that's it. They all come with their own fighting-style, but that you cannot pick or change. Naturally, as soon as you're out of the tutorial, you encounter countless clones of your alter ego.

This game forgoes the standard open world thats standard in many MMOs and instead puts the players in a quest hub/city. From there they go to places like the cellar of a home where it spraws out to individual levels where you fight, do quests and level up. The combat itself is simple but pretty fun combat system that uses standard attacks nd special moves that you string into combos. It does lack a character creator, instead the player chooses one character from a small roster to play out their version of the story.\n\nOver all the game is worth a look if you're a fan of action games or MMOs, its certainly not perfect but still could drain your free time if you're not paying attention.","March 28, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

What this one reminds me of is sort of a cross between Perfect World International - the same makers of this game - and Dungeon Fighter Online, considering the nature of the characters themselves and the playstyle, since this is a 3D arcade style beat-'em-up with RPG influences.\n\nHowever. While this game's graphics are second to none, the English voice acting is rather subpar, to say the least. It's almost as if the actors they got were third-rate hacks that got tossed out of FUNimation, for they don't really sound the parts they're portraying.

I would recomend the game if your just looking to smash stuff up and feel like your god for a bit. I haven't found it to be that challenging and there is a ton of content. The game is very fun i don't think it is meant to be challenging and fusterating. So if your looking for a game that challenges your skill. Then this may not be for you sadly. But if you want something fun go right ahead. The pvp i haven't tried yet. But the cash shop items at my level. Seem pretty strong i got like +3% crit on one item. But it doesn't seem pvp makes that big of a deal yet. Maybe it will later but the game is pretty much just a dungeon crawler.

But there are some pros and some cons.\n\nCons- Costume making. It has taken up so much of my time, and has even made me create new characters cause I either forgot to get something, or somehow got the wrong thing. (Luckily a shared inventory chest exists)\nEach character is just a skin. Edgar is a skin. Angela is the actual person you play. Sure, Edgar is short, adorable, and all else, but he still holds the same weapons, skill master, and skills as Angela. A quick definition. Angela=Edgar. Franz=The Two Vampire girls whom's names still elude me. Tude=Meilin. Natasha=Natasha.\nI find that the social aspect is lacking. I do prefer to play games alone, but when it gets to the point where I'm playing on very hard mode and I'm getting S, SS, or SSS, it's great! But it means that the dungeons are too easy to do with partners! Now, I know that the difficulty may be changed when in a party, but I just can't see the difficulty unless it's the different bosses.\nThe skins were not originally free. I, completely obsessed with the game during the time the original 4 were the only skins, spent money on the Meilin skin, which I later lost due to a Perfect World error.\n\nPros- The skins. Edgar is the cutest little thing, and the youngest Vampire girl is so adorable. The skins also add another approach to things. When in the tutorial, the youngest girl asks where her sister is (The older Vampire sister, neither have relation to Franz), the skins also allow people to play as a Loli, or a Shota, all on the same account. However, Perfect World's switch to Arc Games(Beta, like another Origin for EA players) has caused me to lose my precious little Edgar and Franz.\nThe dungeons are easy to pass, even an F passes. The first time I died, I was in a level 20 or so DGN. That is where it starts to get a little bit difficult.\nAnother pro- The skins are free now!\n\nIt may sound like I'm putting the game down, but I really do love this game and am likely to play it when I don't have much else to do with the other MMO's I play. Have fun and good luck!","March 1, 2014","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

Controls are clunky and unnatural feeling. For example, you move your character with the arrow keys, while using the ASDF keys to attack. Periodically, you have to use the mouse to select menu options, while other menu options require the X key. Camera control is done with the Q and E keys instead of the mouse.. ugh. Graphics are a mixed bag. The game has a cell-shaded look similar to Borderlands, but some elements of the architecture and background feel like they're rendered for a 800x600 display. Also, the game world you start in is a street that has three shops you can enter, a dungeon entrance, and a town square that is mysteriously blocked off from you entering it. The action is twitch-based though, which is a nice change of pace for an MMO (but I use this term lightly as nothing in it feels "massive"). Fighting sequences feel very anime-ish or like any Capcom/SNK fighter (flashy, glitzy, etc). It's free, so I dunno.. you might like it.","September 30, 2011","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Parararasite/recommended/36630/","Parararasite","Mipto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Parararasite/","31 products in account","I really love this game. I really do. But there are some pros and some cons.\n\nCons- Costume making. It has taken up so much of my time, and has even made me create new characters cause I either forgot to get something, or somehow got the wrong thing. (Luckily a shared inventory chest exists)\nEach character is just a skin. Edgar is a skin. Angela is the actual person you play. Sure, Edgar is short, adorable, and all else, but he still holds the same weapons, skill master, and skills as Angela. A quick definition. Angela=Edgar. Franz=The Two Vampire girls whom's names still elude me. Tude=Meilin. Natasha=Natasha.\nI find that the social aspect is lacking. I do prefer to play games alone, but when it gets to the point where I'm playing on very hard mode and I'm getting S, SS, or SSS, it's great! But it means that the dungeons are too easy to do with partners! Now, I know that the difficulty may be changed when in a party, but I just can't see the difficulty unless it's the different bosses.\nThe skins were not originally free. I, completely obsessed with the game during the time the original 4 were the only skins, spent money on the Meilin skin, which I later lost due to a Perfect World error.\n\nPros- The skins. Edgar is the cutest little thing, and the youngest Vampire girl is so adorable. The skins also add another approach to things. When in the tutorial, the youngest girl asks where her sister is (The older Vampire sister, neither have relation to Franz), the skins also allow people to play as a Loli, or a Shota, all on the same account. However, Perfect World's switch to Arc Games(Beta, like another Origin for EA players) has caused me to lose my precious little Edgar and Franz.\nThe dungeons are easy to pass, even an F passes. The first time I died, I was in a level 20 or so DGN. That is where it starts to get a little bit difficult.\nAnother pro- The skins are free now!\n\nIt may sound like I'm putting the game down, but I really do love this game and am likely to play it when I don't have much else to do with the other MMO's I play. Have fun and good luck!","March 1, 2014","true","52.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","4"

This game forgoes the standard open world thats standard in many MMOs and instead puts the players in a quest hub/city. From there they go to places like the cellar of a home where it spraws out to individual levels where you fight, do quests and level up. The combat itself is simple but pretty fun combat system that uses standard attacks nd special moves that you string into combos. It does lack a character creator, instead the player chooses one character from a small roster to play out their version of the story.\n\nOver all the game is worth a look if you're a fan of action games or MMOs, its certainly not perfect but still could drain your free time if you're not paying attention.","March 28, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

I'm rather surprised when I saw the release on Steam because apparently the official OBT opened up a week earlier.. that said, I'm glad because I might have missed it otherwise and yeah - the game is really -that- awesome.\n\nThe combat is really stylish, smooth and full of insane action. Combined with the beautiful cel-shaded anime style graphics I can honestly say that this game beats Lunia in terms of combat and gameplay - hands down.\n\nFor any DMC / Lunia-fan or fans of the brawler genre, this is a game you cannot afford to miss.

Let's start with 'I don't recommend it'.\n\nDespite a seemingly charming style and design, and varied, if slightly confusing, gameplay (resembling Devil May Cry / God of War), all mashed into an MMO, as of this current writing moment, this game is utterly broken..\n\nRampant rollbacks, random economy, unhelpful GMs, overpriced store items, and an utterly ridiculous levelling scheme (the difference between level 41 & 42, might as well be separated by 20 or so levels), just makes this unplayable. In fact, it's more unplayable now than it was on launch.\n\nEven saying all that, it's still a pretty decent game. It's too bad that it seemed to be released 2 years too early.\n\nOh, and you like that Roselle?

I'm rather surprised when I saw the release on Steam because apparently the official OBT opened up a week earlier.. that said, I'm glad because I might have missed it otherwise and yeah - the game is really -that- awesome.\n\nThe combat is really stylish, smooth and full of insane action. Combined with the beautiful cel-shaded anime style graphics I can honestly say that this game beats Lunia in terms of combat and gameplay - hands down.\n\nFor any DMC / Lunia-fan or fans of the brawler genre, this is a game you cannot afford to miss.

There's four default characters, Frantz, Angela, Tude, Natasha; others require Zen to be played. It starts off with the storyline of Frantz and Angela. As you get deeper into the game, stories of friendship, love, hatred are shown. Hunting for equipments in this game is fairly easy, considering the rate of getting unique items. This server runs in NA West, NA East, and EU. Asia players might have a hard time finding parties. The cel-shaded graphics is also one keyed feature in upcoming games, and the technology of using Nvidia 3D Vision to play this game. The gameplay is great and dumb-proof, hack-and-slash.\n\nHowever there are still known bugs in the game, such as (leader being switched after exiting dungeon, loadbar isn't responding if partied with high-ping players, items aren't looted/sold even though the sound is played).

I could go on but the staggering quality of this game can't be put into words. The game seems to mock you by draping its top-tier Asian lounge-rock music over you while you battle ceaselessly against the weight of your eyelids, using one hand to click on monster after monster and navigate through square passages and the other to drink coffee or clean your nose. It gets a massive 8-star rating out of at least 100!\n\nThe makers really nailed the genre. Boobs, spikey hair, characters that act like either children or moody teenagers, mundane ♥♥♥♥ to click on, all peppered with plenty of empty stares and slow, slow, slow, little snippets of dragged-out conversation - it's the perfect recipe for an Earth-shattering anime MMORPG!
