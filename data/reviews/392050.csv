This game is riddled with awful design choices and a questionably placed physics engine. I don't want to spend much time analyzing the game but the enemies all stand still and only turn on what I can describe on a 360 pivotal base latched to their feet. But they stare you down like ice cold maniquens while they gun you down relentlessly with their laser light show guns. The noises are all awful including the constant sound of the doors sliding back and forth. As well as the constant noise prompt of "Target down" every and yes I do mean everytime you kill one of the enemies. So to keep it short and simple don't buy this game at all not even if it's cheaper than a buck 79. 1/10 jesus christ this game was a boring abomniation.

There are six bases, each one almost identical to each other. Absolutely no level design. The enemies have the same formation in each room. They are not even programmed to move. They just stand in place and fire their gun.  If you stay in the crouch position they have little to no chance of hitting you, but if you go in while standing, you'll die in 2 seconds.

You'll be surprised just how terrible the game is. Its so terrible that its a selling point. No one wants to play a game with 75% scores, they want to play one with 25% or lower. The best way I can summarize the game is that its 100 MB and a good reminder of why the Steam refunds exist.\n\nBefore we start with what's wrong, let's start with what's right. The game looks good. It has a good aesthetic even if its just hallways shooting humanoids. The lasers are a rainbow of colors even if they are shot from the same gun. The explosions look good and there are exploding barrels. A must have on the checklist for any first person shooter. It looks like a game I want to play, oh but that's just the wrapping paper of this mystery box.\n\nThe game starts you off in a menu to select from six missions. Each mission is the same, but longer as you go through hallways with turns. Yes that's all single hallways with no deviation, no choice, its as straight forward as can be. Sometimes there are two doors, but one door will lead into a window. Sometimes there are two doors with one door jam. When boxes get between a door, the door goes right through them in order to close.\n\nIn terms of combat, when you woosh open a door, the enemies are already waiting for you. These enemies stand still, there is no logic to them. They stand and shoot. If you think they'll crouch down behind cover, that would require more animation. Again, they literally stand still and shoot at you. Their lasers can pierce through objects. I've seen laser fire come from where a dead enemy was standing. What's more odd than that is hiding in an empty corridor, lasers have come through walls where no enemies should be. Once a hallway is cleared of enemies, it goes dark, but that's probably because the lasers are the only thing illuminating the corridor in the first place.\n\nShooting galleries can be fun, but there are so many enemies firing in quick succession that it becomes difficult even to peak out the door at a single enemy without dying. Opening a door to face five or more foes is suicidal and that makes the game tough without the fun. Oh but you're in luck, the game is so hard that with every limitless death, you respawn rather than restarting the mission.\n\nThis turns a needlessly tough game into a cake walk. Well that is if you like cakes made of... brick. Bland, tasteless, solid as a rock brick. Galactic Hitman is an endurance test. How much standing in a doorway taking gunfire can you endure? More than one mission just to see if the next mission will be different only to find that its the same? How about all six missions with the hallways getting longer and longer.\n\nWhen you die, the game knows you're going to respawn, so it pulls out the gun, but it does it before you respawn. It just sticks out. I've also encountered an issue where I've died, but the game still keeps me alive, but unable to move. So the enemies are still shooting at me, with no hope of respawning. I think this is because when you take damage, its always by 5% of your maximum health. So when I found a glitch that took away 2% of my health, I could heal to over 100% and when i died, I was below 0%. This seems like a basic programming issue where the game respawns the character at zero health rather than zero or less health. When it happens, you'll need to Alt + F4 out of the game, because there is no menu.\n\nThere are glowing green canisters that will regenerate your health by five percent for each second you stand by them. However, they only work half of the time. So one canister will work, while others offer no relief. Its just dull waiting for the health to refill, but the choice is yours, respawn and run to where you were or wait for health. Either way, you'll still die.\n\nYou can look out space windows to see that you're just in a hallway floating in the cosmos. From windows you can also see other hallways, but the problem is the hallways have no exterior to them, so you can see into the hallways from the outside even when those hallways are solid metal with no windows. From the exterior you can also see the glass windows extend far above and below hallways.\n\nAfter you've gone through a mission, you can never replay that mission until completing all missions. When you try to select the same mission, it tells you that its been completed. It tells you with text over text. So imagine trying to read a sentence over a paragraph. To be fair, it looks like the sentence over the paragraph does try to fit between the lines of the paragraph.\n\nThere seems to be a glitch where trying to play the same completed level over and over again will send you to the next level. However, when you finish the level, it is still marked as incomplete and you'll have to do it again.\n\nThe controls are basic and bound to keys with no options of any sort other than a typical game launcher. There is a sprint, which is useful for passing through areas you've already cleared. The jump feels short and useless when the objects can just be pushed out of your way.\n\nYou can change between four weapons across five keys. To change, you press keys 1, 2, 4 and 5. Yes for whatever reason there is no third weapon. These weapons include a pistol, a machine gun, a grenade and a knife. You have all four of these weapons from the start of each mission, because why would an assassin go into battle with only a pistol? Well that and it would take more programming knowledge to pick up weapons.\n\nThe two primary weapons come fully stocked with around 9,999 rounds of ammunition. There is no need to reload, but weapons take a while to fire. Grenades take far too long to throw and explode, because I think your character pulls the pin with teeth before throwing it. The explosions look nice and feel powerful, but in reality the giant shock wave has no effect on the enemies. You need to land a grenade right under them to hurt them, but even then there's no effect. No weapon has an impact. I'm shooting foes with a machine gun and they stand there with no reaction.\n\nOnce you've killed all the enemies a "base cleared" screen popup the instant the last foe is dead. There is no score, you're then kicked back to the mission select screen with no acknowledgement that you just finished a mission or achievements. Unlocking new missions would be a nice frill. Earning money for each job well done or even a rating with points would be a nice touch too.\n\nThere is major room for improvement with Galactic Hitman, but I have a feeling it wants to be the worst game, but there are still others that take the prize. Having more than one hallway would be nice. Larger rooms rather than hallways too.\n\n"Avoid this game and yes it is that bad." Now there's a quote to sell it. Its the perfect game for anyone looking to add a "worst game ever" to their collection or content.","January 5","false","0.8"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","43","44","6","0"

You have weapons with huge ammo account: grenades that aren't really killing people in the area, a superb knife that you can't use unless you have only one enemy, a pistol that isn't really efficient and barrils around that may explode next to your enemy but he's still standing. The only weapon you'll use is the rifle anyway.\n\nDid I mention the fact that enemies can shoot you through closed doors or walls, that they're all facing you, ready to kill you as you have the great idea to stay standing (quick death) instead of crouching and safely hit them one by one?\n\nOr the famous health regenator that is sometimes broken?\n\nOr the fact that despite binding new keys, they're not even taken in account? Meaning that everyone with an AZERTY keyboard is condemned to suffer the WASD keys? Without forgetting that you can't even come back to the main menu unless you beat the level?\n\nOr is it perhaps me that is so stupid to play FPS games, despite a lot of hours in TF2, Doom, Half-Life, Painkiller or Dead Effect or even Killing Floor?\n\nI've used a coupon to try the game that everyone seemed to hate. Because even 2 euros for that crap is too much.\n\nWhy am I not asking a refund? Because of the cards. I want these cards. I will idle for them. And I'm not willing to go through the refund process anyway.\n\nThank god they didn't add achievements. I could imagine the pain to clean a level with the knife only. But hey, on the bright side, when you respawn, enemies you've killed are definitively dead.\n\nRun away from this game. Or buy it at -90%/-95%. Or free key. Or offer it to your worst enemy... if you're a real meanie.\n\nTarget down.","October 24, 2015","false","2.5"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","98","40","41","6","0"

"The Slaughtering Grounds" and "Deadly Profits" are masterpieces compared to this.\n\nFirst off the "Unity Engine Launcher" pops up and you realize it´s gonna be bad in some way :(\n\nYour objective as a "Galactic Hitman" is to liberate 6 bases which you can choose from. (no in-game options)\nIt doesn´t matter which stage you choose, all look the same. (copy pasted every room, no kidding)\n\nThe level design and gameplay are atrocious => open door / kill 6 enemies / repeat until "base clear" / do it for 6 stages and you´re done in 20 minutes, that´s the game for you.\n\nThe enemy AI is just dumb. The enemy placement is always the same for every room and they don´t even move :O\nBut they hit hard if you enter a room you´re dead in 3 seconds unless you crouch, then they barely hit you for whatever reason (no cover needed).\nYou´ve got infinite respawns (if you die) and cannot run out of ammo => no challenge.\nEverytime you kill an enemy the "Galactic Hitman" says "target down", which is annoying as fukc.\n\nThis is more of a demo or even scam than a game. How can you buy something like this piece of crap in the store. (this is listed as a finished game!) >:(\n\nDon´t buy this game, it´s fishy and a huge pile of s-h-i-t.\nNext on To-Do list:\n1. Download "Unity Engine"\n2. Create a short s-h-i-t-t-y game which makes no sense at all\n3. Submit to Steam\n4. Add some trading cards\n5.

I honestly hope it's not even a game, I hope it's meant to be a joke. Glad I got a free code for it, I would'nt pay $2 for it, let alone $0.02!\n\nLet me explain what's wrong with this:\n-Insanely difficult. You open a door, and there's 10 guys with their guns trained on you. Their weapons are full-auto laser beam guns with 10,000 round clips (I swear, I'm dead serious. Your two guns have 10k rounds per clip), so they can basically fire forever. It kills you very quickly.\n-No penalty for dying. You just spawn at the beginning of the "mission" area, and the guys you managed to kill don't return.\n-Each level is the same. Only difference is door placement. Other than that? They're all identical.\n-Only six, 2 minute missions. I played for 10 minutes, and have at least half the game complete.\n-PC gets super hot after playing this crap. This thing can run L4D2, Tomb Raider (2013), etc., so no, it's not the PC.\n-Misleading title. I was expected Agent 47 in space: not the ♥♥♥♥in' Punisher dulled down to ♥♥♥♥.\n-No AI. Like I said, they're just trained to blast your balls off as soon as you open the damn door. They're always aiming at you.\n-They can shoot through the ♥♥♥♥ing wall whenever they feel like it.\n-Abysmal controls. Have they ever even played a video game? E goes to the next weapon, scroll wheel does nothing. No pause function. WASD moves your charter at least, while LMB shoots and RMB zooms.\n-I'd rather play Call of Duty than this crap.\n\nGood things about this game:\n+Trading cards.\n+Objects and weapons look kinda cool. Too bad it was a ♥♥♥♥ idea and a horrid game.","April 21","false","2.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Controls are very odd; 1,2,4,6 are the pistol, rifle, grenade, and knife(respectively). That's right 3 and 5 are not used at all. Besides the wanky controls; the weapons are odd in themselves too. The first mission, only one I played, I had 1000/9999(pistol), 1000/0(Rifle), and 11(grenade) magazine size out of total ammo. The pistol has a recurring glitch where the the display of it shooting a bullet glitches making sparks(the same as the bullet) stay animated on the barrel. Also, it seems with the pistol you can waste ammo faster than bullets are animated or shot. Enemies can shoot through walls, doors, etc. I only was able to defeat the first mission by spamming grenades and dying a lot(enemies stay dead when you respawn) due to the fact that enemies have pinpoint accuracy and you are funneled into a small doorway with a long hall of enemies. The game just needs a lot of work.","September 28, 2015","false","2.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","9","10","3","0"

Enter doorway, another box room. Enter doorway - omg! It's Admiral Ackbar! But wait, he doesn't move or have any animation - all that happens is you get shot to pieces as soon as the enemy sees you. Tried crouching - helps. At a distance, the enemies can be looking at you but miss entirely as long as you are crouched.. similarly, you shoot for a headshot - nothing happens!! The only way the enemy (or you) get a kill is by body shot (??!).\n\nClear the hallway, turn a corner, some more stationary Admiral Ackbars. Kill them, end of mission 1 (of 6).\n\nNo story apart from 'start a mission by selecting one of the red highlighted bases that is being invaded'.\n\nSomehow, there are cards, so it is worth installing for those (to sell), I guess.\n\nI got this game for free - I would be really, really angry if it wasn't. I'd be getting a refund if I somehow managed to buy this on the steam store.\n\nNot recommended!!\n\nNote: I obviously didn't get past the first level - but that first level was bad enough to warrant it.

You have access to 1 gun through the entire game. Not only that, the gun’s fire rate is limited to a predetermined rate that cannot be altered.. However, you can still press the trigger as fast as you can and are rewarded with the gun firing animation, however your fire rate remains unmoved during this entire process. During that time, you face multiple hallways of unmoving turrets err I mean ALIENS that are blocking your path and are actively trying to kill you. Your best option? DUCK. They can't hit you when you duck about 80% of the time and 1/2 of the 2 turreee..... ALIENS won't even shoot while you're ducking...\n\nSee my full review here:\nhttps://youtu.be/SzVYmLzWCY4","April 8","false","0.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Even though I got it for free from a giveaway,it's impossible to give this a positive review due to what I witnessed in this game.\n\nEvery map is literally the exact same.\n\nThe AI are very poorly programmed,if you just crouch walk every map,the AI seriously can not hit you what so ever,if you wanted you could crotch walk every map with the knife and beat the game just like that.\n\nThe final map I played on was the worst mainly because I walked out a barrier I was throwing boxes threw because I was bored and got curious if I could walk through it,and well I did,I fell for an eternity and couldn't reset the map,as if I wanted to.\n\nIt could have been a good game,if it had just a bit more time put in to it...I hope.\n\nI would not reccomend spending 1.99 on this,while there are other games here on steam for 0.99 that can prove to be 100000x better than this game,ever could be. Though still for 1.99 you could get yourself a nice drink from a vending machine or something like that,you'll at least have more enjoyment out of that,than what you'd ever get from this game.","April 3","false","3.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

They might as well be turrets. Each enemy is always in the same place.  They do not duck, do not hide, do not chase you.  They just stand there like statues going pkew pkew.\n\nYou cannot crouch or use anything for cover.\n\nThe enemies can shoot through objects.  They can shoot through walls.  You can't shoot through walls.  You can pick up boxes and exploding barrels through walls, though.\n\nYou regenerate health at a charging station, available ever few dozen paces, by standing next to it.  No animation.  It does make bubbles though.  And you just have to stand near it for a moment.  You can then walk away and your health will continue regenerating to 100%.  It's magical.\n\nThere is no story or anything at all justifying the use of the word "hitman".  The use of the word "galaxy" is also a stretch.  The game should be called Hallway Statuemen.\n\nRemapping controls before startup does not work.  Default control key mappings persist.  Resetting them to default can only be done by editing the registry.\n\nThere are six levels, or "Bases" to clear out.  But there is really only a single map.  You clear the first couple hallways on the first "Base".  The hallways are about twenty paces long.  The second Base is the first two hallways of the first Base, with each stationary enemy shooting from the same position as before, plus a little more of the map.  There's a some variations in starting point and route.  But everything—if "everything" can be used aptly when describing a game which consists of practically nothing—is the same as the previous Base, including enemy placement.\n\nWhen I finished, I hit an exploding barrel while finishing off the last enemy.  We both died, and then it said game completed.  I exited, and the music kept playing after it was closed.  What a game.\n\nDigital Homicide's business model appears to be: 1) Hastily make brief, shoddy games using prefabricated assets.  2) Give out thousands of free keys for them.  3) Hope that there is really is no such thing as bad publicity.  Personally, if I made games this vacuous, I wouldn't advertise it to anyone.","April 3","false","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The only way to survive is to hide behind the doorway and peek out just enough to deal with the enemies one by one, and even then you'll always take damage. Luckily, the developer put in plenty of healing stations, but that seems like a cheap way to make the game playable. The developer seems to have learned from the Slaughtering Grounds and forgone ammo crates and instead gave you tens of thousands of bullets for both guns despite not even needing 1,000 for the average level...\n\nOverall, it's actually one of Digital Homicide's better games, but you should still not waste your money on it.","November 26, 2015","false","1.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyScream/recommended/392050/","SillyScream","Silly Scream","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SillyScream/","999 products in account","This game is just utterly fantastic.\n\nIt consists of 6 levels, each with 2-x Corridors full of enemies, that will shoot at you. Between each corridor there will be a regeneration machine, that endlessly heals you up, even when being shot at by the enemies. Yes, very often you can do exactly that - stay at the machine and fight from there.\n\nYou have 4 weapons to defend yourself. Pistol with unlimited ammo, laser rifle with unlimited ammo, 10 grenades and a knife.\n\nClear the few corrdiors, go back to the main menu, choose another level, do the same. Done. The game can be easily finished within half an hour - if you last that long. Dying doesnt do much, you simply respawn at the start of the map.\nIf you crouch, a rough 80% of the enemies shots will miss.\n\nThats... all there is to th game. The graphics could be nice, but seem miserable. The main menu is horrible. The sound is annoying af after you shoot more than 3-4 times in a row. No music, just shots and doors being opened.\n\nI can totally NOT recommend this.","May 21","false","2.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THIS GAME IS LIKE, I'LL QUOTE SOMETHING I SAID DURING MY DAY ONE: GARRY'S INCIDENT REVIEW "it's the equivalence of if all the animals in the world took the biggest sh*t in their life and piled them on top of each other oh and all of them had the diarreah" AND YES I JUST COMPARED GALACTIC HITMAN WITH DAY ONE: GARRY'S INCIDENT THAT'S HOW BAD THIS IS! DIGITAL HOMICIDE HAVE COM OUT WITH THEIR 8TH HIDDEN SH*T IN THE STEAM MARKET! I WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THEY WOULD HAVE MADE SOME IMPROVEMENT BUT NOOOOOOOO! THEY GET WORSE, AND WORSE, AND WORSE EACH TIME! THIS IS LITTERTALLY SH*T ON SH*T! THEY SHOULD HAVE CALLED THIS GAME GALACTIC SH*TMAN!\n\nWANT TO KNOW WHY I HATE THIS GAME SO MUCH AND WHY IT'S CURRENTLY ONE OF THE LOWEST RATED STEAM GAMES AND YES THIS GAME IS SO BAD NOONE'S JOKING WITH IT. NOONE'S LAUGHING ABOUT HOWBAD THIS IS! DO U SEE ME LAUGHING DIGITAL HOMICIDE!? DO U SEE ANYONE LAUGHING?! THE ANSWER TO BOTH OF THEM IS... NO!\n\nI'll now tell you about galactic hitman it's basically a sci-fi fps.....And that's about it. I can't relly explain much more about this it's  a sci-fi fps there's no plot no characters that's it. You go around "different" space stations and kill everything on it. I say different in inverted commas because they are all copy and pasted. THEY ALL HAVE THE EXACT SAME INTERIORS AT LEAST SLAUGHTERING GROUNDS AND TEMPER TANTRUM HAD 4 DIFFERENT MAPS. GALACTIC HITMAN HAS 1 MAP AND YOU PLAY ON IT 4 1 HOUR. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN OK IF THE SCENERY WAS GOOD TO LOOK AT BUT NO. THIS GAME PROBABLY HAS THE UGLIEST GRAPHICS I'VE SEEN IN THE UNITY ENGINE. FREE TO PLAY GAMES ON GAMEJOLT LOOK BETTER THAN GALACTIC HITMAN.\n\nThis game also has one HUGE problem. IT IS GLITCH HELL! THIS GAME WAS BUGGED EVER SINCE I STARTED IT UP. IT TOOK ME 7 TRIES TO ACTUALLY START GALACTIC HITMAN BECAUSE IT CRASHED EACH TIME IT LOADED UP. AT LEAST DAY ONE: GARRY'S INCIDENT CRASHED DURING GAME AND NOT BEFORE I'D STARTED! there is also a trick where you can never run out of ammunition. Instead of clikcing the LMB to shoot just click LCTRL to shoot so it'll shoot faster and u won't run out of ammunition. Although it would be hard to even run out of ammunition by not even doing this trick as the game starts you off with 10000 bullets. WHY START US OFF WITH 10000 BULLETS? THOSE BULLETS WOULD PROBABLY BE ENOUGH TO GET US THROUGH THE WHOLE GAME OF COD: GHOSTS. AND THE BULLETS REGENERATE EACH TIME YOU ENTER A "DIFFERENT" SPACE STATION. ONE OF THE BIGGEST BUGS IN THE GAME IS THIS. THE ENEMIES WEREN'T PROGRAMMED TO SHOOT DOWN. SO IF U CROUCH THE PIGS WILL SHOOT THE AIR AND THE OTHER ENEMIES WON'T SHOOT AT ALL. WHICH MEANS THAT IF U CROUCH THROUGH THE WHOLE GAME U CAN COMPLETE THE GAME WITH 100% HEALTH. THERES ALSO A GLITCH WHERE IF U R HIT WITH AN EXPLOSION THEN GO TO A HEALTH STATION IT'LL PUT UR HEALTH TO 102%. EVERYTIME U SHOOT UR GUN THE WHOLE SCREEN LOOKS LIE IT WAS HIT BY A HURRICANE.IT ZOOMS IN, IT ZOOMS OUT. IT SHAKES ALL OVER THE PLACE. SOME OF THE DOORS DON' HAVE ANYTHINGBEYOND THEM. U CAN LITTERALLY LOOK INTO SPACE AND U CAN EVEN SEE THE WHOLE MAP. ALSO SOME OFTHE HEALTH STATIONS WERE GLITCHED INTO THE WALLS WHICH CAUSE ME AND A FRIEND OF MINE TO JUST SHAKE OUR HEADS IN DISGUST!\n\nI'M HOPING THAT DIGITAL HOMICIDE HAVE NOTICED HOW BAD GALACTIC HITMAN WAS BEECAUSE THERE HASN'T BEEN ANOTHER GAME RELEASED SINCE THIS! I'M HOPING THAT MEANS THEY'RE CURRENTLY MAKING ANOTHER GAME BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY WORKING HARD ON ITAND TAKING CARE INSTEAD OF MAKING ONE GAME A MONTH!\n\nTHIS IS ON OF THE WORST GAMES ON STEAM FOR A REASON! PEOPLE SHOULD LISTEN TO THE REVIEWS. MOSTLY NEGATIVE SHOULD SAY SOMETHING TO THEM.\n\nFINAL VERDICT\n\nPROS\n\nTHERE IS NONE\n\nCONS\n\n-BUG GALORE\n-UGLY GRAPHICS\n-THIS IS THEIR 8TH GAME AND THEY HAVE LEARNED NOTHING\n-DUMB AI\n-BAD TEXTURES\n-NOT FUN\n\nFINAL VERDICT: 1/10\n\nSteam Curator group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/MellowReviews","December 20, 2015","false","1.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

The game is about a nameless galactic hitman (who has no name) who shoots aliens to save refugees.  The character may SEEM to be just a cardboard cut out protagonist, but it's to show the players that her struggle, too, is deep.\n\nFurthermore, despite never seeing these hostages, it's clear to us the pain they go through every day toiling away to those evil aliens.  The aliens are the Dargenziz Pirates, allegorical to the real life Somali Pirate crisis in 2009.  The game is just too clever for its own good.\n\nNow when you crouch in the game, one of the npc's doesn't seem to shoot at you.  Why you ask?  The answer is simple, the protagonist has a PhD in Psychology and is psychologically destroying the enemy from within.  The enemies also don't move, probably because the protagonist is also paralyzing them in fear with her devastation she is inflicting on the alien's kind\n\nThe gameplay is also truly original, you run from area to area to shoot things.  No one has ever come up with that idea. Ever. Every time you kill one of these aliens the narrator shouts "Target down!".  Now, this may seem annoying, but the narrator plays a role too.  He is telling the player that you have killed an alien.  Imagine, if this alien had a family, a wife, children, now all to you, he is simply just a target in the major scheme of things.  Truly biting commentary about the Gulf Wars.\n\nIn conclusion, this is the greatest game of the year, no the decade, the century, all time.  This game will win every award in show, it beats Undertale, Tales from the Borderlands, The Witcher 3, Fallout 4, etc.  Those games are nothing compared to this grand masterpiece.  The Nobel Committee is even considering awarding the creators of the game with the Nobel Piece Prize.  Time Magazine, Rolling Stone, People Magazine, they are all raving about this game and how it will shape the future of society.  I'm hoping for more DLC and a GotY edition of the game.  Thank you very much Digital Homicide for such a sound, quality product.\n\n100/100","December 16, 2015","true","0.7"," 48 of 111 people (43%) found this review helpful 108 people found this review funny","43","48","111","108","2"

I have to say, It was an experience.\n\nThe Graphics are impressive. I believe they are the best we'll see before 2015 ends. What really caught my eye were the laser effects, they were very detailed and bright. You could feel the power behind your weapon with every bolt you fired, though it would be nice if they were a bit less bright.\nFurthermore, the performance was incredible. The game is so optimized that my aging computer was able to run it perfectly at sixty frames per second while on max settings.\nAdditionally, the controls felt very fluid. It felt as if your character and his/her weapon had weight when you looked around, as it swung like you would in real life. Sprinting looked like you were running at your most, and crouching showed how your character was trying to be stealthy by moving the weapon in a certain way.\nThe maps were very nice. Each had something unique in it, and I loved how each ramped up the difficulty. The windows allowed you to view the station you were fighting on, which was appreciated. The dead ends made you feel like you had no escape, and forced you to fight your way out.\nFinally, the gameplay was amazing. Big groups of tough enemies behind cover made the missions very challenging, but this was slightly brought down by the conveniently placed healing stations. Crouching made you stealthy and allowed you to avoid most of the enemy fire, and the explosive barrels aided greatly in taking down the opposition.\n\nAll in all, Galactic Hitman one of the best games I've ever played. I really recommend it. Gift it to your friends and spread the Christmas Love!","December 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 5 of 37 people (14%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","14","5","37","17","2"

But, for a quick little game it isn't that terrible. You have basic elements that all FPSs have, like ADS, weapon selection, running and jumping.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/daguywithdashadow/recommended/392050/","daguywithdashadow","daguywithdashadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/daguywithdashadow/","38 products in account","Galactic Hitman is a 3d first person shooter. The story is that you play as a galactic hitman who must defeat the space pirates who have taken over the colonists' space stations. Developed by Digital Homicide Studios, famous for games like The Slaughtering Grounds and Temper Tantrum, it is a nostalgic call-back to FPS games like Doom and Shadow Warrior.\n\nThe game's music is chilling and sets a sinister mood for the rest of the game. Shamefully, the only piece of music in the game is on the title screen. The first improvement I would make to the game would be to add more music, which I feel would help benefit each level's atmosphere and aid tension. The models and textures, whilst nice to look at and are very pleasing for the eye, do get a bit repetitive. Different themes for each of the levels would be also be highly beneficial. Onto the levels. Each of the 6 levels are set on different Colonist-owned space stations overridden by space pirates. Your goal is to kill them all so the base can be retaken. Gameplay is very simple, kill all the space pirates and take back the base.\n\nFor the game's £1.50 price, I can't argue with 30 minutes of gameplay. Some people may find this to be a bit too small, but personally, I think it's fine. Each of the level's use the same assets and enemies, but I feel there is a deeper meaning to this. Each of the levels represent the main character's (whom we shall call Rhonda) mental state. She is exploring her psyche, delving further and further into her mind. This is mirrored in the levels where more and more is revealed to us of seemingly the same space station. She is searching for answers in the rooms, and must defeat her mental barriers (the pirates) to find them. This deeper meaning adds a whole new depth to the game, which I personally, felt intruiging. As repetitive as the levels are, there is sort of a narritive being told. The first missions are short but sweet, introducing you to the weapons and enemies. The later missions get longer, and the final mission is almost maze-like. It feels like an epic conclusion to the game.\n\nThere is some voice-acting in the game, like a message that tells you when an enemy has been defeated. This is very helpful but different varities of voice clips would've been even better. Another message tells you when the mission has been completed and the base has been retaken, it's almost very rewarding. A few cutscenes wouldn't have hurt though, especially for the ending. Onto the gameplay. The gameplay plays like a mixture of Doom and Shadow Warrior's gun gameplay. You have a pistol, a rifle, a knife and grenades. The pistol is like a weaker, but faster-firing version of the rifle, which is more powerful but slower-firing. The knife does defeat most enemies in two hits, which would be useful as a stealth tactic or if you run out of ammo, however, the game gives you more than plenty ammo, so you don't need to worry at all. The grenade is great for dealing large amounts of damage, but I didn't find that useful in killing enemies. I'd personally use the grenade to weaken a large room full of pirates before engaging.\n\nThe pirates are very powerful and challenging to defeat, which is something I don't see much of in modern FPS games these days. If you are struggling, you can always crouch, which reduces alot of enemy fire. Some people may see this as a way of cheating, but I see it as more of a balance to the game. Performance wise, the menu is a bit laggy, but I can excuse that because of the insane detail put into the space station models in the menu. The main game works very well when it's not rendering any entities or enemies, which can dog down the FPS. I would only advise playing this game on minimal settings and a fairly good computer. I think with some polishing, scratch that, alot of polishing and revamping, Galactic Hitman could be a good game. It definitely has potential to be a very deep, thought-provoking game. However, in this current state, I'd only reccommend Galactic Hitman if it's very cheap on sale or you are looking for a very different FPS experience. Buyer discretion advised.","December 29, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So inquiring customer, have you watched the video closely? If so you have noticed the main problems with this game. If you haven't I'll wait... go on now... let's see what you notice...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\nOk by now you've probably noticed it. THE. ENEMIES. DON'T. MOVE. So, I would like to say that this shows some bad A.I. but, really, it's almost a complete lack of A.I. This is what I think the enemies code should look like in the game files:\n\nWait for player to enter room\nShoot at player.\n\nEnd Code\n\nAlso, this game looks like CRAP. I have well over the recommended requirements, and I STILL can't get the game to look like the photos in the teaser section. By the way, the weapons kinda suck. I mean seriously, why does a STEAK KNIFE, 2 shot enemies in FUTURISTIC BODY ARMOR. Also, the level design sucks. Just look at my screenshots. You can be charging through a door (with the sprint feature with no limits), and fall out of the world. Because that just happened to be some sort of airlock that looked EXACTLY like any other door. Also, the environment isn't "interactive" unless you count the basic physics of boxes flying into the air when you shoot them. DEAR GOD this game is an ABSOLUTE FAILURE that doesn't even deserve a STERLING silver medal. Maybe an award for screwing over your playerbase would be in order. Also... the "colonists" and story are never mentioned ingame. There are no colonists. Maybe you're just a Galactic Cat Burgler breaking into people's homes for all you know. Just don't get it, and hope that Digital Homicide stops killing it's playerbase and actually makes a GOOD game. That isn't reviewed in the beginning by bribed fans.\n\nAlso, one last thing. This game is easy. I beat two bases in about 7 minutes... just crouch before doorways and shoot with the pistol and knife things. Don't worry about other weapons. Crouching makes you basically invincible, and the pistol and knife are overpowered.\n\n(P.S. You know it's bad when I give it a negative review, in fact, this is the only negative thing on my reviews section. Check, you know I'm right. (unless I'm wrong... in which case tell me))","December 1, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/392050/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","There are plenty of good indie games on Steam. This is not one of them. This game is like Halo if Halo was made in some nameless Chinese sweatshop.\nThe gameplay is just boring and trashy. Walk forward. Shoot. Walk forward some more. Occasionally make a small detour to kill some enemies off the main path. Rinse. Repeat until you've beaten all 6 sloppily designed levels. There is no challenge, because the only punishment for dying is respawning good-as-new at the beginning of the level, and having to run back to the action. The term "action" is very generous, because all enemies stand still, are barely animated, and can barely hit a crouching target at more than 5 feet removed.\n\nThe guns aren't even fun to use. The pistol is too weak. The knife, when combined with crouching, is too overpowered and not fun at all. In fact, none of the game is fun.The grenades have a tiny explosion radius and take too long to throw. The automatic is just... meh. Running out of ammo is not a concern, because the player always spawns with more than is practical. In fact, I did a little experiment with the automatic. It took me 19 minutes and two seconds of nonstop shooting to go through the entire 10,000 round magazine. I would have tested the pistol, too, but I wanted to do something more productive with my time, i.e. absolutely anything.\nThe guns are also kind of buggy. I noticed that using ctrl to shoot, instead of the mouse button, fired the gun without using ammo, provided no recoil animation, and allowed me to shoot boxes without moving them. The same thing also happened if I used the mouse to shoot when I was out of ammo, but considering how difficult it is to run out, this is a pretty minor offense.\n\nIt's glitchy, it's generic, it's linear. Thank God it's also short. I beat it in 37 minutes. I spent more time waiting for the trading cards than I took on my playthrough.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a game that is worth neither time nor money, even at a discount. I got it off of a coupon and I still feel ripped off. It would be best used to break up with your girlfriend or boyfriend, along with a note that says, "I would've sent you a bag of dog turds, but instead you can have this, which put me back $1.99, because I hate you that much."\n\n9/10","December 29, 2015","false","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can just confirm statements found in other reviews - enemies are like turrets, their setup in each room is always the same, and when you crouch, you are 95% untouchable.\n\nFor similar or better experience, download .kkrieger from the web.","December 31, 2015","false","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They were right, I couldn't not because it's such utter trash but because it doesn't even have two hours of gameplay for me to endure and rub in their face that "Ha, you underestimate how much of a masochist I can be to prove a point."\n\nI could go into great detail about how this "game" is one of the least polished pieces of trash I've ever played, and yes, I'll do exactly that.\n\nImagine a Doom/Duke Nukem style shooter. Only instead of a good game what you're getting is six maps that are exact cookie cutter models of the previous map.  Only with more enemies, a few more airlocks and a few more twists and turns to take before you get shot to death in 10 seconds again. You're given three weapons, a pistol with unlimited ammo, a rifle with unlimited ammo, and 11 grenades. Given that grenades are the only real way to kill yourself in this game I just used those.\n\nThe good news is though, at least the enemies won't respawn after you die, nor will they regenerate their life taken from them. The other good news is that if you really cared about dying is that there's a health regeneration mechanic every 10 steps you take. But because of the fact that I already mentioned that you can literally go in guns blazing, take down three enemies and come back to clear the other side of the hall with no reprecussions whatsoever. I didn't see the point when I could just run back in the time it took me to regenerate my health.\n\nAlso, where's my giant robot to fight that was promised on the store picture?\n\nPros: It's colorful?\n\nCons: Linear, cookie cutter maps, cookie cutter enemies, no way to strafe whatsoever, only one way to play the game which is hold W and Mouse 1 at the same time.\n\nUltra Cons: I feel bad that the person delivering pizza in 20 minutes won't get a tip because I wasted the $2 on this "game"","January 13","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The configuration of the enemys make food fights animation look like gollum from lord of the rings. the controls are akward, storyline (if you can call it that) is boring, and audio so loud if would make you want to get a full frontal lobotomy with a spork. oh and "TARGET DOWN" trust me you dont wnat to know that refrence it would mean buying the game","May 30","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Same scenery with slight variations of box positioning. When you finish the space station (a sequence of said rooms), You get to go to another station that would look just like the first.\nStory? None\nReason to be shooting? Well they do shoot you back so they might be the bad guys right? Or maybe you are the bad guy.\nSpecial effects? Well they shoot coloured lasers....and....there is smoke some times and...that's all\nSeriously got it for free and still want a refund 'cause it's not even worth my 0 cents","June 2","false","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
