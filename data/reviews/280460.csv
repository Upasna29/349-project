Let's skip ahead to why I gave this game a thumbs-down.\n\nTypically in an arcade game you can be awarded a 1up for passing certain scores. Let's say the first 1up is for 50,000 points, the second is at 200,000, and the rest are every 500,000 thereafter.\nThis doesn't apply to Pulstar. I got my first 1up at 2,137 points, the second at 13,854, and didn't receive anymore even after crossing 1,418,255 points.\nIn my next game, I got my first 1up at 22,478 points, the second at 24,890, and 1-2 every few seconds from about 4:01 to 4:30.\nThe following game? I got my first 1up at 486,977 points, and..didn't receive anymore lives for the rest of that attempt.\n\nBut guess what? It doesn't really matter. Getting a high-score in this game practically requires that you don't die, so all those extra lives are just trolling. Congrats! You bought yourself an extra second of survival. When you die you lose your kill-streak, and that's a massive multiplier that simply disappears into the ether. Screen-clearing bombs are several times more useful, but they rarely make an appearance. Power-ups stay on-screen indefinitely, so it's in your best interest to save those bombs for when they're really necessary (after the 4 minute mark).\n\nVisually, this game is a mess. It's easy to lose track of things in most twin-stick shooters, let alone one with shifting brightness levels. There's a slowdown ability for when things get too hectic, but it messes with the screen really badly.  Surrounding the playfield is a mess of clouds, they hide where enemies appear from. This is information I probably could use to avoid getting blind-sided for the 177th time.\n\nPulstar is supposed to appeal to the hardcore with its singular focus and extremely difficult achievements, but there's not enough there to justify giving it any serious time. Getting the best run feels more like something that will happen when the planets align, not when my skill reaches a certain level. On average I spend the first four minutes of every game preparing for everything going to hell at 4:01. Afterwards I stumble semi-blindly into a series of brick walls for a minute or two. This isn't fun, this is just me trying to prove that I'm actually putting in effort. I don't want to be that guy who doesn't like a game because he "doesn't get it". But man, this isn't worth the headache.","January 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","0"

The game is basic, almost barebone, which is fine for me and many others. However, it suffers from two major issues: horrible contrast and jerky movement controls. The game starts out easy but soon becomes overwhelming with continuous waves of enemies. Pulstar's replayability stems from the single and multiplayer world ranking that it offers. In the advanced wave stages, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to identify enemy elements due to the overdone graphics saturation. Additionally, you won't be able to adjust the jerky movements which makes advancing in this game more of a matter of luck than skill. Finally, the multiplayer option is limited to local co-op with no online functionality. The developers have decided to keep the game as is which is truly a shame.\n\n+Great concept\n+Beautiful graphics\n+Local Co-op\n+World Ranking\n\n-Barebone game\n-High color saturation/no contrast\n-No online multiplayer\n-Jerky movement controls","August 24, 2015","false","22.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Each game is very short, lasting a matter of minutes. It looks like the longest game played in the online highscores is only 10 minutes. The controls aren't customizable so if you're playing with a mouse, be prepared to hold the left click down until your hand cramps, because that's the only way to fire, and you don't want to not be firing (why isn't this automatic?) The game's contrast also leaves something to be desired, as it gets difficult to see the bad guys coming at you. Also, since the screen is rectangular instead of square, enemies coming from the top and bottom of the screen are much more dangerous than the same enemy from the left or right.\n\nWith some improvements, this game could be more fun.

Lovely, then you don't need to play this.\n\nPulstar is a ♥♥♥ for tat recreation of the original Geometry Wars, including the original GW's dearth of mode types. You have one basic mode, and that mode can be played with a friend via local co-op, so it has that going for it. Unfortunately, it doesn't play quite as well as GW, due mostly in part to it's graphic style. If you've ever stared into a bright screen in a dark room only to look away to find a stray Cheeto that fell to the floor, then you have an idea of what it's like to play Pulstar. Thanks to the ultra-bright sun in the middle of the screen and your own flashy visage and shots, you can barely see the dark enemies against the dark blue background.\n\nAnd that's...pretty much it. The enemies are difficult to see about 3 minutes in, when the game starts to throw all three enemy types at you as fast as it can. You'll die soon after that. I got my highest scores when I just stayed in the middle, swirling the right thumbstick on my gamepad. Any attempt to do otherwise would see me swarmed by the beasties in a matter of moments.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to play this over the majority of other similar twin-stick shooters.

While it does not revolutionize twin-stick shooters, it is a very good entry into the genre.  If you enjoy twin-stick shooters, you will probably enjoy this one as well.\n\nUp Front:\nPros:\n* Nice, fluid graphics\n* Short rounds that you can pick up and put down\n* Good controls (at least with a controller)\n\nCons:\n* Sound (specifically background music) could be a bit more varied.\n\nNice to Haves:\n* More enemy types\n* Online Multiplayer\n\n\n--- Full Review ---\nYou might notice that at the time I am writing this review, I do not have many hours into the game.  That is because a single round of the game lasts only a few minutes.  There are not multiple levels, various environments, or a ton of depth.  What the game lacks in length, it makes up for in no nonsense twin-stick shooter gameplay.\n\nGraphics: Visuals are very fluid, and the game has a nice ambience.  The visuals are not over complicated, and that is a good thing for a shooter like this.  Between trying to dodge various enemies and scoring as many points as possible, there is not a huge need for overdone graphics.  In addition, the HUD is simple and does not distract.  In Geometry Wars, the point value of an enemy appeared above the enemy after you killed it.  That is not the case with this game.  Your running score is kept at the top right, out of the way.\n\nA note that might matter to some.  The game seems to be locked at a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Available resolutions are 1280 x 720, 1536 x 864, and 1920 x 1080 in both windowed and full screen modes.\n\nGameplay: With no long story or epic battles, the gameplay comes from the challenge.  This game challenges you to improve your skills and pits you against other Pulstar players via leaderboards.  This is evident in the achievements.  Almost half the achievements are gained by doing better than others or the developers (either in single player or multiplayer).  A controller definitely makes the experience better.  The controls are simple: the left stick moves, and the right stick shoots.  If you need to use a special item, the trigger button is there for you.\n\nThere are three basic enemies.  It would have been nice to have a few more enemy types, but the enemy types the game does have are different enough that this is not such a huge deal.\n\nThe time dilation mechanic is an interesting one, and is similar to the one in Waves.  You hit the button, and time slows down so you can more easily maneuver around enemies and take them out.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is simple and is not something to write home about, but it gets the job done.  The background music is very strong, but the sound effects are very light and almost fragile sounding.\n\nMultiplayer: I did not try the multiplayer, but something that might make it more appealing is online multiplayer.  This is not a dealbreaker though.","November 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first thing you find odd is the movement, that is because there is acceleration on the player model itself, making it nearly impossible to stop when you let go of the keys. But the acceleration is a constant and is very easy to learn after about 15-20 minutes of practicing. The points system works by adding 1 point per kill to your unit destroyed reward counter that adds to your total every kill you achieve. It's a bit difficult to explain in text, but essentially the first kill you get +1 to your total points, the second kill you get +2 points, so on and so forth. The points increment also resets when you get hit and lose a life, so if you got a kill worth 45 points and got hit, your next kill would be worth 1 point to your total. Every now and then an enemy will drop a +10 kill worth token which increases the points per kill by 10. Much rarer is the life saving CLEAR SCREEN token, which when you pick up, kills everything on screen, visible and offscreen, this process adds to your total per enemy killed, so if you get 50 kills you will get the kill worth value up 50 and get the amount of points relative to the kills as if you got them one at a time. The one power up you get to control when to use is the time slow device, this device has saved my life multiple times and has allowed me to bob and weave through enemies to get the screen clearing token. The one thing I found the game was missing is a crosshair, I kept losing track of my tiny mouse pointer that blended with the background at times.\n\n~Gameplay~\nPlaying this game for points, different strategies in movement and shooting produce different results providing a mixture of gameplay routes. I found sitting in the center and shooting in circles to work exceptionally well. After that I found moving and doing that worked better than remaining to sit in the center. The fact that every game ever played has lasted under 12 minutes (highscore) shows the pure difficulty of this game. My longest game was about 6 minutes long. The difficulty of this game is highly welcoming for high score seekers and fans of the Genre alike.\n\n~Story~\nWhen entering the game for the first time you are introduced to the shortest stories for a game I have seen so far. What is there in the story is basic background to why you are playing this game lore wise as well as the funniest opeining line ever by referencing starwars in a family guy style manner. I wish there was a story mode, but I am content with what there is.\n\n~Replay Value~\nI found myself wanting to come back to this game for the prospect of being #1 on the leaderboards. Other than that, I would most likely not come back to play this game. This game does not have replay value for non competitive people. If you don't want to try and be the very best, like no one ever was, this game is not for you.\n\n~~~SCORING~~~\nMechanics - 9/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 4/10\nReplay Value - 5/10\nPrice to Playtime Ratio: 5/10 (3 hours / $5)\n\n~~~~~OVERALL SCORE~~~~~\n\n~~60/100~~","March 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's skip ahead to why I gave this game a thumbs-down.\n\nTypically in an arcade game you can be awarded a 1up for passing certain scores. Let's say the first 1up is for 50,000 points, the second is at 200,000, and the rest are every 500,000 thereafter.\nThis doesn't apply to Pulstar. I got my first 1up at 2,137 points, the second at 13,854, and didn't receive anymore even after crossing 1,418,255 points.\nIn my next game, I got my first 1up at 22,478 points, the second at 24,890, and 1-2 every few seconds from about 4:01 to 4:30.\nThe following game? I got my first 1up at 486,977 points, and..didn't receive anymore lives for the rest of that attempt.\n\nBut guess what? It doesn't really matter. Getting a high-score in this game practically requires that you don't die, so all those extra lives are just trolling. Congrats! You bought yourself an extra second of survival. When you die you lose your kill-streak, and that's a massive multiplier that simply disappears into the ether. Screen-clearing bombs are several times more useful, but they rarely make an appearance. Power-ups stay on-screen indefinitely, so it's in your best interest to save those bombs for when they're really necessary (after the 4 minute mark).\n\nVisually, this game is a mess. It's easy to lose track of things in most twin-stick shooters, let alone one with shifting brightness levels. There's a slowdown ability for when things get too hectic, but it messes with the screen really badly.  Surrounding the playfield is a mess of clouds, they hide where enemies appear from. This is information I probably could use to avoid getting blind-sided for the 177th time.\n\nPulstar is supposed to appeal to the hardcore with its singular focus and extremely difficult achievements, but there's not enough there to justify giving it any serious time. Getting the best run feels more like something that will happen when the planets align, not when my skill reaches a certain level. On average I spend the first four minutes of every game preparing for everything going to hell at 4:01. Afterwards I stumble semi-blindly into a series of brick walls for a minute or two. This isn't fun, this is just me trying to prove that I'm actually putting in effort. I don't want to be that guy who doesn't like a game because he "doesn't get it". But man, this isn't worth the headache.","January 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","0"

The game is basic, almost barebone, which is fine for me and many others. However, it suffers from two major issues: horrible contrast and jerky movement controls. The game starts out easy but soon becomes overwhelming with continuous waves of enemies. Pulstar's replayability stems from the single and multiplayer world ranking that it offers. In the advanced wave stages, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to identify enemy elements due to the overdone graphics saturation. Additionally, you won't be able to adjust the jerky movements which makes advancing in this game more of a matter of luck than skill.

The game's contrast also leaves something to be desired, as it gets difficult to see the bad guys coming at you. Also, since the screen is rectangular instead of square, enemies coming from the top and bottom of the screen are much more dangerous than the same enemy from the left or right.\n\nWith some improvements, this game could be more fun.

Lovely, then you don't need to play this.\n\nPulstar is a ♥♥♥ for tat recreation of the original Geometry Wars, including the original GW's dearth of mode types. You have one basic mode, and that mode can be played with a friend via local co-op, so it has that going for it. Unfortunately, it doesn't play quite as well as GW, due mostly in part to it's graphic style. If you've ever stared into a bright screen in a dark room only to look away to find a stray Cheeto that fell to the floor, then you have an idea of what it's like to play Pulstar. Thanks to the ultra-bright sun in the middle of the screen and your own flashy visage and shots, you can barely see the dark enemies against the dark blue background.\n\nAnd that's...pretty much it. The enemies are difficult to see about 3 minutes in, when the game starts to throw all three enemy types at you as fast as it can. You'll die soon after that. I got my highest scores when I just stayed in the middle, swirling the right thumbstick on my gamepad. Any attempt to do otherwise would see me swarmed by the beasties in a matter of moments.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to play this over the majority of other similar twin-stick shooters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteyFresh/recommended/280460/","WhiteyFresh","MusclesLinguine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteyFresh/","358 products in account","Pulstar is similar to twin-stick shooters like Geometry Wars, Ultratron, Waves and others.  While it does not revolutionize twin-stick shooters, it is a very good entry into the genre.  If you enjoy twin-stick shooters, you will probably enjoy this one as well.\n\nUp Front:\nPros:\n* Nice, fluid graphics\n* Short rounds that you can pick up and put down\n* Good controls (at least with a controller)\n\nCons:\n* Sound (specifically background music) could be a bit more varied.\n\nNice to Haves:\n* More enemy types\n* Online Multiplayer\n\n\n--- Full Review ---\nYou might notice that at the time I am writing this review, I do not have many hours into the game.  That is because a single round of the game lasts only a few minutes.  There are not multiple levels, various environments, or a ton of depth.  What the game lacks in length, it makes up for in no nonsense twin-stick shooter gameplay.\n\nGraphics: Visuals are very fluid, and the game has a nice ambience.  The visuals are not over complicated, and that is a good thing for a shooter like this.  Between trying to dodge various enemies and scoring as many points as possible, there is not a huge need for overdone graphics.  In addition, the HUD is simple and does not distract.  In Geometry Wars, the point value of an enemy appeared above the enemy after you killed it.  That is not the case with this game.  Your running score is kept at the top right, out of the way.\n\nA note that might matter to some.  The game seems to be locked at a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Available resolutions are 1280 x 720, 1536 x 864, and 1920 x 1080 in both windowed and full screen modes.\n\nGameplay: With no long story or epic battles, the gameplay comes from the challenge.  This game challenges you to improve your skills and pits you against other Pulstar players via leaderboards.  This is evident in the achievements.  Almost half the achievements are gained by doing better than others or the developers (either in single player or multiplayer).  A controller definitely makes the experience better.  The controls are simple: the left stick moves, and the right stick shoots.  If you need to use a special item, the trigger button is there for you.\n\nThere are three basic enemies.  It would have been nice to have a few more enemy types, but the enemy types the game does have are different enough that this is not such a huge deal.\n\nThe time dilation mechanic is an interesting one, and is similar to the one in Waves.  You hit the button, and time slows down so you can more easily maneuver around enemies and take them out.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is simple and is not something to write home about, but it gets the job done.  The background music is very strong, but the sound effects are very light and almost fragile sounding.\n\nMultiplayer: I did not try the multiplayer, but something that might make it more appealing is online multiplayer.  This is not a dealbreaker though.","November 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerkoyd/recommended/280460/","killerkoyd","fisH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerkoyd/","1285 products in account","Pulstar is a colorful top down shoot'em'up. I found myself enjoying this game for it's interesting design and immense challenge. Containing only 3 types of enemies, I thought this game was easy, that was before I made it past the 3 minute mark. Playing for the high score and my spot on the leaderboard, I got all the way to 119th before getting burnt out due to the game's difficulty and RNG mechanics.\n\n~Mechanics~\nThe games mechanics goes everywhere from RNG enemy spawning, RNG powerup spawning, RNG score multiplier spawing to acceleration in movement. When you first open up the game it reminds you of a normal top down shoot'em'up. The first thing you find odd is the movement, that is because there is acceleration on the player model itself, making it nearly impossible to stop when you let go of the keys. But the acceleration is a constant and is very easy to learn after about 15-20 minutes of practicing. The points system works by adding 1 point per kill to your unit destroyed reward counter that adds to your total every kill you achieve. It's a bit difficult to explain in text, but essentially the first kill you get +1 to your total points, the second kill you get +2 points, so on and so forth. The points increment also resets when you get hit and lose a life, so if you got a kill worth 45 points and got hit, your next kill would be worth 1 point to your total. Every now and then an enemy will drop a +10 kill worth token which increases the points per kill by 10. Much rarer is the life saving CLEAR SCREEN token, which when you pick up, kills everything on screen, visible and offscreen, this process adds to your total per enemy killed, so if you get 50 kills you will get the kill worth value up 50 and get the amount of points relative to the kills as if you got them one at a time. The one power up you get to control when to use is the time slow device, this device has saved my life multiple times and has allowed me to bob and weave through enemies to get the screen clearing token. The one thing I found the game was missing is a crosshair, I kept losing track of my tiny mouse pointer that blended with the background at times.\n\n~Gameplay~\nPlaying this game for points, different strategies in movement and shooting produce different results providing a mixture of gameplay routes. I found sitting in the center and shooting in circles to work exceptionally well. After that I found moving and doing that worked better than remaining to sit in the center. The fact that every game ever played has lasted under 12 minutes (highscore) shows the pure difficulty of this game. My longest game was about 6 minutes long. The difficulty of this game is highly welcoming for high score seekers and fans of the Genre alike.\n\n~Story~\nWhen entering the game for the first time you are introduced to the shortest stories for a game I have seen so far. What is there in the story is basic background to why you are playing this game lore wise as well as the funniest opeining line ever by referencing starwars in a family guy style manner. I wish there was a story mode, but I am content with what there is.\n\n~Replay Value~\nI found myself wanting to come back to this game for the prospect of being #1 on the leaderboards. Other than that, I would most likely not come back to play this game. This game does not have replay value for non competitive people. If you don't want to try and be the very best, like no one ever was, this game is not for you.\n\n~~~SCORING~~~\nMechanics - 9/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 4/10\nReplay Value - 5/10\nPrice to Playtime Ratio: 5/10 (3 hours / $5)\n\n~~~~~OVERALL SCORE~~~~~\n\n~~60/100~~","March 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's skip ahead to why I gave this game a thumbs-down.\n\nTypically in an arcade game you can be awarded a 1up for passing certain scores. Let's say the first 1up is for 50,000 points, the second is at 200,000, and the rest are every 500,000 thereafter.\nThis doesn't apply to Pulstar. I got my first 1up at 2,137 points, the second at 13,854, and didn't receive anymore even after crossing 1,418,255 points.\nIn my next game, I got my first 1up at 22,478 points, the second at 24,890, and 1-2 every few seconds from about 4:01 to 4:30.\nThe following game? I got my first 1up at 486,977 points, and..didn't receive anymore lives for the rest of that attempt.\n\nBut guess what? It doesn't really matter. Getting a high-score in this game practically requires that you don't die, so all those extra lives are just trolling. Congrats! You bought yourself an extra second of survival. When you die you lose your kill-streak, and that's a massive multiplier that simply disappears into the ether. Screen-clearing bombs are several times more useful, but they rarely make an appearance. Power-ups stay on-screen indefinitely, so it's in your best interest to save those bombs for when they're really necessary (after the 4 minute mark).\n\nVisually, this game is a mess. It's easy to lose track of things in most twin-stick shooters, let alone one with shifting brightness levels. There's a slowdown ability for when things get too hectic, but it messes with the screen really badly.  Surrounding the playfield is a mess of clouds, they hide where enemies appear from. This is information I probably could use to avoid getting blind-sided for the 177th time.\n\nPulstar is supposed to appeal to the hardcore with its singular focus and extremely difficult achievements, but there's not enough there to justify giving it any serious time. Getting the best run feels more like something that will happen when the planets align, not when my skill reaches a certain level. On average I spend the first four minutes of every game preparing for everything going to hell at 4:01. Afterwards I stumble semi-blindly into a series of brick walls for a minute or two. This isn't fun, this is just me trying to prove that I'm actually putting in effort. I don't want to be that guy who doesn't like a game because he "doesn't get it". But man, this isn't worth the headache.","January 17, 2015","false","1.7"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","33","39","2","0"

The game is basic, almost barebone, which is fine for me and many others. However, it suffers from two major issues: horrible contrast and jerky movement controls. The game starts out easy but soon becomes overwhelming with continuous waves of enemies. Pulstar's replayability stems from the single and multiplayer world ranking that it offers. In the advanced wave stages, it becomes unnecessarily difficult to identify enemy elements due to the overdone graphics saturation. Additionally, you won't be able to adjust the jerky movements which makes advancing in this game more of a matter of luck than skill. Finally, the multiplayer option is limited to local co-op with no online functionality. The developers have decided to keep the game as is which is truly a shame.\n\n+Great concept\n+Beautiful graphics\n+Local Co-op\n+World Ranking\n\n-Barebone game\n-High color saturation/no contrast\n-No online multiplayer\n-Jerky movement controls","August 24, 2015","false","22.2"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Each game is very short, lasting a matter of minutes. It looks like the longest game played in the online highscores is only 10 minutes. The controls aren't customizable so if you're playing with a mouse, be prepared to hold the left click down until your hand cramps, because that's the only way to fire, and you don't want to not be firing (why isn't this automatic?) The game's contrast also leaves something to be desired, as it gets difficult to see the bad guys coming at you. Also, since the screen is rectangular instead of square, enemies coming from the top and bottom of the screen are much more dangerous than the same enemy from the left or right.\n\nWith some improvements, this game could be more fun.

Lovely, then you don't need to play this.\n\nPulstar is a ♥♥♥ for tat recreation of the original Geometry Wars, including the original GW's dearth of mode types. You have one basic mode, and that mode can be played with a friend via local co-op, so it has that going for it. Unfortunately, it doesn't play quite as well as GW, due mostly in part to it's graphic style. If you've ever stared into a bright screen in a dark room only to look away to find a stray Cheeto that fell to the floor, then you have an idea of what it's like to play Pulstar. Thanks to the ultra-bright sun in the middle of the screen and your own flashy visage and shots, you can barely see the dark enemies against the dark blue background.\n\nAnd that's...pretty much it. The enemies are difficult to see about 3 minutes in, when the game starts to throw all three enemy types at you as fast as it can. You'll die soon after that. I got my highest scores when I just stayed in the middle, swirling the right thumbstick on my gamepad. Any attempt to do otherwise would see me swarmed by the beasties in a matter of moments.\n\nThere is absolutely no reason to play this over the majority of other similar twin-stick shooters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteyFresh/recommended/280460/","WhiteyFresh","MusclesLinguine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/WhiteyFresh/","358 products in account","Pulstar is similar to twin-stick shooters like Geometry Wars, Ultratron, Waves and others.  While it does not revolutionize twin-stick shooters, it is a very good entry into the genre.  If you enjoy twin-stick shooters, you will probably enjoy this one as well.\n\nUp Front:\nPros:\n* Nice, fluid graphics\n* Short rounds that you can pick up and put down\n* Good controls (at least with a controller)\n\nCons:\n* Sound (specifically background music) could be a bit more varied.\n\nNice to Haves:\n* More enemy types\n* Online Multiplayer\n\n\n--- Full Review ---\nYou might notice that at the time I am writing this review, I do not have many hours into the game.  That is because a single round of the game lasts only a few minutes.  There are not multiple levels, various environments, or a ton of depth.  What the game lacks in length, it makes up for in no nonsense twin-stick shooter gameplay.\n\nGraphics: Visuals are very fluid, and the game has a nice ambience.  The visuals are not over complicated, and that is a good thing for a shooter like this.  Between trying to dodge various enemies and scoring as many points as possible, there is not a huge need for overdone graphics.  In addition, the HUD is simple and does not distract.  In Geometry Wars, the point value of an enemy appeared above the enemy after you killed it.  That is not the case with this game.  Your running score is kept at the top right, out of the way.\n\nA note that might matter to some.  The game seems to be locked at a 16:9 aspect ratio.  Available resolutions are 1280 x 720, 1536 x 864, and 1920 x 1080 in both windowed and full screen modes.\n\nGameplay: With no long story or epic battles, the gameplay comes from the challenge.  This game challenges you to improve your skills and pits you against other Pulstar players via leaderboards.  This is evident in the achievements.  Almost half the achievements are gained by doing better than others or the developers (either in single player or multiplayer).  A controller definitely makes the experience better.  The controls are simple: the left stick moves, and the right stick shoots.  If you need to use a special item, the trigger button is there for you.\n\nThere are three basic enemies.  It would have been nice to have a few more enemy types, but the enemy types the game does have are different enough that this is not such a huge deal.\n\nThe time dilation mechanic is an interesting one, and is similar to the one in Waves.  You hit the button, and time slows down so you can more easily maneuver around enemies and take them out.\n\nSound: The soundtrack is simple and is not something to write home about, but it gets the job done.  The background music is very strong, but the sound effects are very light and almost fragile sounding.\n\nMultiplayer: I did not try the multiplayer, but something that might make it more appealing is online multiplayer.  This is not a dealbreaker though.","November 18, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerkoyd/recommended/280460/","killerkoyd","fisH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/killerkoyd/","1285 products in account","Pulstar is a colorful top down shoot'em'up. I found myself enjoying this game for it's interesting design and immense challenge. Containing only 3 types of enemies, I thought this game was easy, that was before I made it past the 3 minute mark. Playing for the high score and my spot on the leaderboard, I got all the way to 119th before getting burnt out due to the game's difficulty and RNG mechanics.\n\n~Mechanics~\nThe games mechanics goes everywhere from RNG enemy spawning, RNG powerup spawning, RNG score multiplier spawing to acceleration in movement. When you first open up the game it reminds you of a normal top down shoot'em'up. The first thing you find odd is the movement, that is because there is acceleration on the player model itself, making it nearly impossible to stop when you let go of the keys. But the acceleration is a constant and is very easy to learn after about 15-20 minutes of practicing. The points system works by adding 1 point per kill to your unit destroyed reward counter that adds to your total every kill you achieve. It's a bit difficult to explain in text, but essentially the first kill you get +1 to your total points, the second kill you get +2 points, so on and so forth. The points increment also resets when you get hit and lose a life, so if you got a kill worth 45 points and got hit, your next kill would be worth 1 point to your total. Every now and then an enemy will drop a +10 kill worth token which increases the points per kill by 10. Much rarer is the life saving CLEAR SCREEN token, which when you pick up, kills everything on screen, visible and offscreen, this process adds to your total per enemy killed, so if you get 50 kills you will get the kill worth value up 50 and get the amount of points relative to the kills as if you got them one at a time. The one power up you get to control when to use is the time slow device, this device has saved my life multiple times and has allowed me to bob and weave through enemies to get the screen clearing token. The one thing I found the game was missing is a crosshair, I kept losing track of my tiny mouse pointer that blended with the background at times.\n\n~Gameplay~\nPlaying this game for points, different strategies in movement and shooting produce different results providing a mixture of gameplay routes. I found sitting in the center and shooting in circles to work exceptionally well. After that I found moving and doing that worked better than remaining to sit in the center. The fact that every game ever played has lasted under 12 minutes (highscore) shows the pure difficulty of this game. My longest game was about 6 minutes long. The difficulty of this game is highly welcoming for high score seekers and fans of the Genre alike.\n\n~Story~\nWhen entering the game for the first time you are introduced to the shortest stories for a game I have seen so far. What is there in the story is basic background to why you are playing this game lore wise as well as the funniest opeining line ever by referencing starwars in a family guy style manner. I wish there was a story mode, but I am content with what there is.\n\n~Replay Value~\nI found myself wanting to come back to this game for the prospect of being #1 on the leaderboards. Other than that, I would most likely not come back to play this game. This game does not have replay value for non competitive people. If you don't want to try and be the very best, like no one ever was, this game is not for you.\n\n~~~SCORING~~~\nMechanics - 9/10\nGameplay - 7/10\nStory - 4/10\nReplay Value - 5/10\nPrice to Playtime Ratio: 5/10 (3 hours / $5)\n\n~~~~~OVERALL SCORE~~~~~\n\n~~60/100~~","March 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This aside, enemy bullets are a bright, contrasting red and are easily distinguishable. Also, the fact that there is only one ‘stage’ is disappointing.\n\nAll in all, I find myself struggling to come up with more to say, as the game is pretty barebones. Even for it's low price, it is hard to recommend considering the whole experience is very shallow.","January 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game obviously has been developed for analog input, rendering digital keyboard gameplay clunky and hard to control. Most of the enemies look like card board cutouts, seeing the playable ship rendered in a good quality this is a major letdown for me. Music is really good but the game gets repetetive really fast. There are way more intereisting shmups and arena twin stick shooters out on steam, this feels a bit cheap, very sadly because I wanted to like it.","January 8, 2015","false","1.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This could be a really small time killer but I don't recommend paying the full $4.99 amount fot this title. I bought this game with a %50 coupon and i still felt it wasn't justified to still pay $2.49. It the game's benefit, it does have a lot potential but the game falls on it's face by not reaching further and developing on the concept. It could use some work and I would think they could build on this concept and makie it a little bit deeper.\n\nPROS:\nController-support\nSimple concept\nDecent time killer\nCONS:\nShallow, almost no depth\nLack of potential\nNot worth the price\nControl Sensitivity","October 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Controls feel clunky, which I assume is deliberate, but makes the game less fun. Singleplayer ran fine on Linux, when I clicked "Start" in multiplayer it crashed. Seeing as this game isn't much better than most flash games content wise I can't really recommend it for any price above zero.","August 28, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
