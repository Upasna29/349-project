Period.\n\nDrox Operative is actually and ARPG set inside a 4X game being played out by AI's.  You can influence events in a myriad of ways.  You create a ship, generate a galaxy which will have some number of races playing in it, and you can win by allying yourself with the victors, or if you are particularly bloodthirsty you can just ♥♥♥♥ everything in sight until you accumulate the points for a "Fear" victory.  Afterwards you can retain your ship in a newly generated galaxy.  It is so satisfying to play an RPG in a "living" universe rather than mindlessly grinding through the same old dungeon with randomly spawning enemies until you reach some boss.\n\nOne of the great innovations is that the modules with which you fit your ship do not go into specific slots, but instead there are "hi, mid, low" slots (much like in EVE).  So, if you want 4 lasers, you can do it.  If you want 5 reactors to give you very rapid cap recharge, you can do it.  You want 5 engines so your ship zips around the map?  You can do it.  Are you a Romulan who fantasizes about redundant cloaking devices?  Well, you get the idea.\n\nThere certainly seem to be no other RPG's out there like Drox, so if you like space and you like RPG's it's a must-buy, but there is some room for improvement:  In my opinion the visual appeal of the game is non-existant, and staring at it for hours gets rather drab, but rest assured the great gameplay will keep you doing just that.  Though there is large array of loot you will find, I certainly feel that they could add many more modules which do a much wider variety of different things.\n\nAnyway, for $10 or $20, you certainly shouldn't regret this buy.","February 18, 2014","true","63.8"," 163 of 173 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","163","173","2","0"

Drox Operative lets you do just that!\n\nDrox Operative is an action RPG with a good dose of space exploration. But where other space exploration games take place in static or semi-static universe, a notable feature of Drox Operative is that NPC factions expand and develop like races in 4X Space Strategy would: they establish new colonies, build ships and space stations, research new technologies and of course fight both neutral enemies and each other. This creates unparalleled feeling that you are adventuring in a living world, which constantly moves on regardless of your actions!\n\nIn regard of RPG stats, Drox Operative does a good job of simulating that your “character” is a spaceship: character’s attributes are replaced by your crew’s expertise in various fields. Though the result is fairly similar in regard of distributing “crew points”, immersion-wise the system accomplishes its job.\n\nThe equipment system differs from that of most RPG in that most of equipment slots (all except for 3 specialized slots based on your ship’s design, that is) freely allow to install any equipment of appropriate tonnage. Want to add an extra engine instead of your heavy laser turret? No problem! Have a medium ballistic weapon instead of aforementioned laser turret, which unlike the later you can install in place of your radar? Ditto! This makes your ship very customizable and allows you to adjust it according to your playing style (and re-outfit it whenever you feel like it).\n\nAnd the final unique feature of Drox Operative is crewmates. They technically function as equipment (occupying either the special crew slot, or the light slots), but unique in that they level up as well, improving the bonuses they provide over time.\n\nTo sum it up, Drox Operative is a great game, and I fully recommend it to anyone who likes action RPGs, space exploration, or both!","March 17, 2014","true","161.9"," 111 of 111 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","111","111","0","0"

It's a surprisingly fun yet incredibly deep game. You can lose and win the game a number of different ways and play it accordingly. Want to play by making everyone fear you? You can do that. Want to win the hearts and minds of the alien species? You can do that. Want to explore and blast bad guys? You can do that. There's a ton of gameply customizability options to make the game easier or harder or slower or faster. The graphics are a bit dated, but there's nothing that pulls me out of being immersed in the soap opera like politics that I was neck deep in. Tons of races and ships to get started and star systems to explore with random encounters and loot all over the place.

The idea is that you are part of a group called the Drox Guild, with the goal of maintaining the presence of the Guild in the sector (the game world).  There are several ways one can win or lose, giving YOU the player the ability to choose how to win/fail.  Like the other Soldak games, this features the living world around you aproach to the hack and slash.  Quests have time limits.  Success or failure will cause changes to the game world.  That radiation leak on the planet won't fix itself, and if you leave it for long enough the planet can suffer more woes that you can solve.  But should you buy this game?\n\nYes.  Yes you should.  Here is why:\n\n+You are a space mobster.  Really the game should be called Drox Moberative.\n+Technically infinite gameplay, just because you beat the sector doesn't mean you can't keep playing in particular in HOW you won the sector.  I got a "fear" victory while at war with two races and battled them for a good two hours to make little head way.\n+Decent gameplay.  Its a hack and slash, but it is tuned to make sense and it plays pretty well.  The battles are engaging and enjoyable, if not overwhelming at points.\n+VERY diverse worlds.  It is improbable that you will get the same sector twice.  In addition to simply having a random lay out, each system and sector have different moddifiers (more enemies, more agressive behavior, more traps) so you never know what you are going to get with your new sector.  On top of that, Mods Mods Mods.  Add more mayhame with mods\n+Easy to lose track of time with.  Not sure why that is a plus but what ever.\n\nThat said there are some things to be desired such as stat point distribution, but most if not all can be fixed with mods.  Give the demo a try if you are still not sure.  It is much more engaging than one would think.","February 20, 2014","true","30.6"," 37 of 41 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","37","41","2","0"

Ever wondered what it would be like to be that random event that caused citizens to rebel, technology to be sold to your enemy, a race that you would like to be a friend but just won't listen because some element in the game says 'Hell no!'?\n\nWell in this game you can; This is a top-down space shooter, but around the player several computer players are playing out a space strategy game. You can befriend them, you can fight them, you can trade with them, you can support them in their war or colonization efforts, you are a Drox Operative. And the other races know that to have a Drox Operative on your side is the path to victory.\n\nThe graphics are great and the player is allowed a reasonable range of customization to make it his/her own. Musical score and sounds a pretty good, as is the general feel of the game. I did have some problems with the keys though, and understanding what the game was about in the first place, but after 15 mins of just diving in head first I found it surprisingly easy to understand. As for the keys, would like a weapon group to be used for weapons; The only weapon that fires when pressing the mouse is weapon no. 1, although in all fairness I haven't been looking for it very hard, its probably in there somewhere.\n\nYou can only have 1 ship (per Operative / Save slot ) and it is a persistant ship (and crew), meaning it carries over from one game into the other. A bit confusing is a game being called a 'Sector', which from what I understand is a galaxy, which happens to consist of...sectors...ya... Anywho, you can fully customize your ship to be a fighter, bomber, trader, colony vessel, or any combination you may think of. It grows in class as you grow in experience (and award points to a particular skill) opening more slots in your ship to install equipment in.\n\nAll in all an original idea realised; A gem in any original gamers collection.","June 21, 2015","true","195.0"," 31 of 33 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","31","33","0","3"

It may not be much to look at but it's one of those games where every galaxy you play has a different little story to go along with it. I love being able to observe (and meddle in) the wider politics of the  game world while slaughtering bad guys ARPG style. It makes the game into more than just an excercise in  loot gathering.The other thing I find important that this game has is an insane amount of character customization and different ship parts which unlock all kinds of cool abilities. There arwe an almost infinite amount of  possibilities for different builds you could do.\n\nOne thing that's either a strength or a weakness of the game depending on how you look at it is the game is pretty unforgiving especially when you haven't designed your character and ship very well. It is the sort of game where everything can be going along fine and then suddenly you are swarmed by more than you can handle. Since this game saves pretty much everything and never lets you go back and reload a save older than the last thing you did death has some nasty consequences even on softcore difficulty, it makes it very satisfying when you find a build that finally is able to survive most encounters but it get get frustrating as well.\n\nBottom line: If the concept of this game looks appealing to you at all - get it.

Fans of games like EV Nova might enjoy this game just for that.\n\nBut there's more. Instead of being story-driven, the game randomly generates new quests and events as you play. An elite space monster shows up, starts gathering a fleet, and if you don't react, he might take over a star system. Then the monster starts sowing chaos on nearby colonies; they might contract a plague, get computer virus, etc. These events can also escalate if unchecked. I've seen empires lose planets to open rebellion. I've HELPED rebels escalate, and contributed to the creation of offshoot races!\n\nAlso the various species - and your guild, the Drox - all have dynamic relationships. Help a race, they like you more. Attack them, they like you less. Help their allies, and they like you. Attack their allies, and you might earn more enemies than you intended. You can carefully nursemaid a sector-spanning alliance of friendly races for a diplomatic win... or watch the network of alliances fail like a house of cards if you bungle your relationship with one of the races. That might be a good time to switch tactics and go for another type of win.\n\nThe various systems interact in what looks like a well-tuned, balanced way - no surprise because the game has been out for some time. The interactions give this game a nice emergent-gameplay edge that keeps things interesting, and there's nothing more hilarious than being a few planets away from a military victory and having the Drox Guild tell you that you MUST, due to Circumstances Beyond Your Control, ally with the race you've just been eradicating colony by colony from this area of known space.\n\nHighly recommend for fun ARPG-in-space with a sandboxy twist.\n\nEdit: There is an expansion out, which is not on Steam at the time of this writing. You can purchase the expansion from Soldak and apply it to the Steam version of the game to gain access to additional features. He's also said that he's working on getting it into steam.

You are plopped into a procedurally generated sector where you must achieve any one of a list of victory conditions. Whether you succeed or fail (by producing a loss condition) the sector closes and you start the process again.\n\nThe problems start with the foundation. The game is almost entirely created from code recycled from Soldak's older Diablo clones. Added to that old code is a shallow diplomacy system that any player of Civilization will recognize. Some of the phrasing used in diplomacy screens is identical to what can be found in Civilization 4 or 5. I don't think it's wrong to copy ideas, but there's not enough original creativity in the diplomacy system for my taste.\n\nGoodStable with few bugs, none of which break the game\n\nMultiple paths to victory (clearly duplicated from Civilization but still interesting)\n\nMultiplayer works well\n\nI like the cosmetic variety of ships, though for the most part, they don't play much differently.\nNeutralDated graphics, even for the release date\n\nThe game is action-oriented. There's no story, and only a vague backstory.\nBadWhat my friends call an "RNGesus" loot system where loot drops are like lottery tickets, and most are losers.\n\nThere is no difference whatsoever between victory and defeat in a sector, other than victory provides you with one or more boxes of random loot, Being random, the loot is mostly worthless.\n\nCode duplicated from Diablo clones means out-of-place mechanics like loot that "drops" onto an invisible surface and must be picked up manually each time.\n\nInventory management is a central "feature". Much of the game involves sorting through a torrent of nearly identical equipment and crew members, then failing to sell the excess because the NPC factions don't have the credits to buy them. The game starts by starving you of inventory space, multiplying the annoyance.\n\nNPC factions are one-dimensional warmongers with the negotiation skills of Civ's Atilla the Hun. It is common to see NPC factions wipe each other out while still exploring the first system in the sector trying to make contact with one.\n\nWhile multiple routes to victory are possible, only military victory is reasonable in most cases. For example, if you want a diplomatic victory, you must achieve a military alliance with all extant factions. This is a feat in itself, since usually any aid you provide to one faction angers at least one of the others. On top of that, though, you must get the AI factions to ally with one another. The only mechanic provided for this is to visit planets of each faction and navigate through a "rumor" menu dozens and dozens of times until you improve relations, a very tedious enterprise that is costly, and must be funded by missions (which anger other factions) or hunting monsters for loot (which the factions can't buy because they run out of money).\n\nThe monsters have a pathetic AI, and to compensate, there are endlessly spawning legions of them, leading to dull, repetitive combat with stupid but numerous and durable enemies. This happens regardless of how well civilized the system. I have seen systems lost to monsters after achieving victory, all because I took some time to organize my inventory.\n\nYet another game with a point distribution system that has no "respec" mechanic but requires perfect planning, allowing you to play dozens of hours in a ship before realizing that your build is invalid at higher levels.","December 20, 2015","false","10.1"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

It's actually been some time since a game sucked me in like this and to be frank I wasn't expecting it at all.  I won the game bidding during the holiday auction so it was free and it was the game I bid on after winning my first choice with the points I had left over. I was so wrong. This game should have been the first choice.   Heck I would have gladly paid for a game of this quality.\n\nNow on to the actual game itself.  The weakest points are the graphics and music.  Having said that , if you are playing an ARPG and expecting top notch graphics I thinjk perhaps you're unfamiliar with the genre.  The music itself is less forgiveable, though with a small publisher/development team I'm glad they focused on gameplay instead.  I can always play my own music in the background and turn off the music in the options, and I do. (A mix of several sci-fi soundtracks currently. )\n\nThe gameplay is where this tirle shones.  Its an arpg true but you can navigate with WASD and fire in any arc around your ship. It plays like the winderkind love child of Diablo II and Space, Pirates, and Zombies, and Bounty Hunters.  Another title that's worth a look if you like this sort of thing.  There is a lot of customization available for engines weapons, etc. At first I didn't notice much difference in loadout honestly but as time went on the advantages and disadvantages of each become much more clear as you and your enemies get more powerful.  The expandable inventory if the cargo bay system is also a nice treat and a great way to deal with the looting issue of a full inventory.\n\nThe overall metagame is what truly sets this apart though with consequences following your choices of who to help and whom to attack.  I allied early with the Shadow because they were at the time overwhelmingly powerful.  Thought I'd go for a quick win that way.  Well, I alkienated another race by attacking them on behalf of the Shadow and was never able to revcover their trust.  In the end I had to fight a long hard battle and do a LOT of diplomacy as they kept buying off my Shadow allies as I worked toward a Fear victory.  That's right multiple victory conditions exist here from diplomacy (which actually seems relevant for once in a game) to military conquest to  a mercenary route of making so much money that your Drox masters are uber pleased.  You can lose all those ways as well so take a look at victory conditios when you first start.\n\n\nTLDR:  Great game for ARPG, space opera, and sandbox game fans with unique and engaging systems that are surprisingly deep.  Graphics and audio dated and weak. I'd give it a 7/10 and if they remade this with a AAA budget I'd preorder. Something I never do.","December 17, 2014","true","103.9"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

I play it occasionally but never really sink in a significant amount of time into any given titles of the genre but after giving Drox Operative a try, I find it to be very accessible and, more importantly, highly enjoyable! Originally a 2012 title developed by Soldak Entertainment, came on to Desura and later on to Steam in February 2014. For an almost 4 years old title, Drox Operative still holds well against today's standard.\n\nYou play as one of the ten races, each with their very own perks and bonuses, available to choose from and act as the guild representative in the galaxy. Your job is to conquer and sway the other races in favor to what the higher commands of the guild demands. Think of it as a hand that works in the shadows, controlling everyone in silence. Illuminati, anyone? At the start of each generation of Sectors, you'll be given specific goals from the higher command (for example, Destroy the Dryads, Keep the Cortex alive, etc.) and accomplishing this will net you rewards that you can use in your subsequent playthrough. So, kill, destroy, declare wars, persuade, spread propaganda, rally your allies, disrupt the economy or basically anything to get the job done! This is what intrigued me the most about this game, so much freedom in actions!\n\nDrox Operative can be a little bit overwhelming at the start, especially to the newcomers, but they really did a great job on the tutorial explaining the bits and bobs on how the game works and rolls out the game in a comfortable pace so that you'll be familiarized and settled before the game dishes out the advanced stuff. For the veteran gamers of this genre looking for a little challenge, they provide an optional advance settings at the start of each game (Hardcore, Semi Hardcore, Unlucky, etc.)\n\nThe gameplay revolves around two main parts, one is exploration and the other diplomatic relations. Exploration is self-explanatory, as each of the generated Sectors are randomized, you have to venture out into the open space searching for new races, analyze planets, discovering jump gates, acquire better equipment for your ship and the more you explore, the more choices and options will be available for your conquest. Diplomatic relations, in the other hand, involves either making good terms with specific factions(doing quests, protect from hostile units, colonize planets, trading) or just do your best in abolishing your opposition, be it by rallying with your ally or just straight out declare war on them! Decisions, decisions, decisions.\n\n\nPROS\nHighly enjoyable and deep space action RPG that provides non-linear courses for you to ensure victory!\nCombats are fast and satisfying unlike a few others that I've played.\nShips are fully customizable whether you opt for more firepower and defense while sacrificing speed and maneuverability or be a speed demon that you know you are and drop the heavy Armor Plating and equip the various weapons of war you'll find!\nYour ship will leveled up as you play and points are given for you to distribute in the many stats available, just like in traditional RPG, so customization is possible.\nThe graphics, while nothing outstanding, are visually pleasing to the eyes (especially when ships blew up!) although the UI can arguably be better.\nFrom a technical point of view, Drox Operative runs great with a stable FPS all around, even during big battles, and I've not experienced any crashes or hiccups of any kind so far. Steam basic functionalities are also present and functional with the exception of Cloud saving.\nReplay value is extremely high as each new Sector is different when generated, with 10 races to choose from, different ways of achieving victory and the availability of online co-op can provide a significant game changer to the already great game.\nThere's also a challenge mode where specific rules and modification to the Sectors are applied.\nCONS\nThe first time you clicked the Play button you'll be greeted with a text box requiring you to input a CD key, as per usual as any Ubisoft, EA or Stardocks games. Good thing you don't have to install anything though.\nA 100% achievement completion rate is possible but it requires a significant amount of time investment.\nThe multiplayer scene is pretty much dead. I would love to try out the co-op mode but since not many of my close friends have it, I'm gonna have to miss out and joining a public game isn't an option since there's basically no one to play with.\nQuests sometimes are time-sensitive but the game fails to mention this. I've failed countless of missions because of this and failure means poorer relation with the said race.\nAs a final verdict, Drox Operative deserves a solid 4/5. A satisfying space RPG worthy enough to be played for years to come!\nAt a $20 price tag, it does feel a bit steep for a 4 years old game but if you have friends with similar interest, then it's definitely worth it! Likewise, when the title goes on sale. It's a no-brainer for space junkies to pick this up for a price less than $10.\n\n\n\nFor similar Steamified Reviews and Giveaways, please visit http://www.steamified.com/.

Stages (sectors?) develop organically and your actions have a real effect on how the world's situation plays out. Quests are generated based on NPC factions' evolving needs and your success or failure shape overall who gets to live, die, become powerful, become friends or enemies. There is even a meta-game in that relations and power levels carry over somewhat between sectors in the same galaxy. Factions that start out as sub-races or rebel groups, if they survive enough, can become permanent factions in future stages. Starting factions can become extinct.\n\nMany ways to win a sector, many ways to lose. The game is challenging at higher levels and requires (political) strategy, not just fast clicking. You can freely customize your ship with any parts you meet the reqs for, and share equipment among characters via stash, which gives you great flexibility but also the potential to completely ruin yourself. Building up the ship is fun, but the more expensive your build is the harder it is to pay repair/replace costs when you die; fail enough and a sector can become unwinnable.\n\nThis is a great, fun game but its weak graphics and difficult nature may be a turn off to many. I recommend it though for anyone who likes building up a character and testing it against random worlds full of monsters and rival factions.","September 20, 2014","true","116.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nerney9/recommended/274480/","Nerney9","Nerney9","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nerney9/","4746 products in account","Product received for free\n\nShort Version: Diablo and Heroes of Might and Magic had a baby and stuck it in a rocket and sent it off to space where it was raised by FTL to appreciate the finer points of spaceship building and random events and run-on sentences.  Action-RPG and 4x-Strategy gameplay mesh well in Drox Operative, which is slightly dated but extremely enjoyable as a replayable grind-to-gear fest.\nAlso:  'Drox Operative' is actually space lingo for 'Super Space Mercenary', in case anyone is as confused as I was when first hearing the title.\n\nDid you ever play a strategy game like HoMM and wonder why those 'heroes' were always hanging around in taverns waiting for someone to hire them before they'd lift a finger to help?  Well, obviously they were part of a secret guild of super-mercenaries looking to profit off the endless conflict... or at least that's the answer in Drox Operative, where you get to play as the side that always wins in a universe at war - the side getting PAID, by anyone and everyone!\n\nDrox Operative is an action-RPG that lets you control a mercenary ship plopped into the middle of a randomized intergalactic battlefield between a bunch of 4x-strategy AIs, where your actions will help decide the ultimate victor(s) - for a hefty fee, of course.  Instead of a traditional campaign, each mission in Drox Operative consists of a cluster of inhabited planets with the various races (humans, robots, bugs, lightbulbs, pet rocks, space orcs, etc - the usual suspects) all competing for dominance.  Your goal is to convince each and every race in the sector that they should be paying you and the Drox Guild to do all their dirty work, by any means necessary - and those means are completely up to you.\n\nAs a mercenary operative, you choose which quests to undertake, which planets to trade or share information with, and which alien races would be better off as allies or nuked into space goo.  You can impress, bribe, dominate, suck-up-to, subvert, or destroy any faction you choose, so long as once the dust clears, any survivors see the benefit - and necessity - of paying you for your services.  The Drox Guild will give you bonuses for fulfilling certain objectives in any given scenario (such as allying with one faction and destroying another), but you are always free to ignore these token incentives if you so choose - so if you reeeeally want to blow up those smelly space orcs in every map even when your bosses ask you nicely not to, there's nothing stopping you.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit overwhelming when you first start, but once you get the hang of things, it can grow extremely absorbing.  Drox Operative plays much like other randomized action-RPGs, where the 'end-game' is to continue beating mission scenarios to get bigger and better ships and weapon loadouts, and take on even tougher missions with your newer deadlier toys.   You can customize your ship in various ways, going fast and full of lasery doom, slow and indestructible with more missiles than you can shake a space stick at, or anything in between.  You also get additional bonuses in certain stats depending on which alien race your ship originates from.  With many, many missions to undertake before you max level on a given ship, and 10 different races you can try (along with a shared stash to encourage building up an extra operative or three), there is an enormous amount of replayability in this game.\n\nOf course, while Drox Operative has a lot of ticks in the positive column, the game does have its flaws.  It should be noted that there is very little story to speak of; You are a super space mercenary repeatedly sent to randomized star systems to show off your guild's badassitude - and that's about it.  Also, as of this review, the game is definitely starting to feel dated.  The graphics, audio, and even the menus/tutorials all seem rather antiquated, reminiscent of games released a decade ago.  The gameplay itself still holds up just fine, but you should not purchase this game expecting anything close to current-gen game engines in the visual/audio department.\n\nAll in all, Drox Operative is a fun, highly replayable game, which I would certainly recommend to gamers who enjoy freeplay scenarios in strategy games along with the endless cycle of gearing and grinding in action-RPGs.  At the base price of $20, Drox Operative isn't as cheap as I'd anticipate for a storyless action-oriented game that is starting to show its age,  but there is still plenty of content to enjoy in this game, especially if you can pick it up in a sale.\n\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

And I gotta tell you, even if the graphics don't look so great on the screenshots, there can be quite awesome battles going on, which will fill your screen pretty nicely.\n\nOnly thing that bothers me, is the sound design: The weapons sound... old/weird, the music isn't really fitting and the thruster sound of the ship can get quite annoying aswell. I suggest to get some music going in the background and then play away.\n\nI dumbed almost 5 hours in my first time playing this and I don't regret a single second. One of the most enjoyable games I've played in quite a while.\n\nOfcourse it's recommended to get some friends to play with, but no one wanted to play with me (*sadface*) so I can't really say how the co-op works and if its any more fun (which, I presume, it is).\n\nSorry for the butchered english, I'm not a native English-speaker (I don't think that's even a real word...).","July 1, 2014","true","48.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/laivasse/recommended/274480/","laivasse","Laivasse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/laivasse/","226 products in account","I saw some footage of this game in January 2013 which was enough to tempt me into trying the free demo. My curiosity was piqued but I wasn't expecting much - just a bit of a time killer to tap away at and fill up a bit of the afternoon. I came away several hours later with the music stuck in my head, feeling as if very little time had passed, then went on to have a dream about Drox Operative that same night. I bought the game from Soldak's site the next day and have been playing Drox on and off since then without ever having cause to regret the puchase.\n\nIt's a hugely addictive little loot-focused ARPG with a beguiling amount of depth. As most reviews have mentioned, the most compelling feature is the sense of a living galaxy going about its business in the background while you perform the basic functions of clicking, killing, looting, equipping and selling. Essentially the alien AI races play a 4X style strategy game against eachother (albeit in real-time) while you fly about attempting to affect the outcome, with the goal of satisfying the win conditions set by the Drox guild (such as uniting the AI races, or allying with the winner of an all-out war, or victory via exploration and volume of quests completed, etc.). After triumph in one sector, you move onto the next one - presumably a harder one, although the player can set the parameters for each randomly generated sector, including difficulty. Coop online play is possible, as well as 'Hardcore' (permadeath) mode which unlocks once you get a ship to level 25.\n\nEverything the player does affects the game universe in some way. Destroy a named boss monster and the planets in that system will become more prosperous for the alien races who hold them, giving those races more resources to build ships and advance their technology faster. Leave that monster to its own devices and he may form a fleet with other tough mobs, create malicious devices in space or perform acts of sabotage against the AI and their planets - which in turn leaves them crying for help from you, the Drox Operative, to solve all their newfound problems in the form of new quests.\n\nPerforming a fetch quest to prevent a planetary famine may solve that planet's problem - or it might produce another fetch quest from that planet, as they ask you to help destroy their rampant 'super weed' created by the fertiliser you delivered. Failing to solve fetch quests involving riots and civil war may even result in the creation of new races, who splinter off from their parent race and colonise planets of their own, becoming a new force in the sector. Alternatively you might intentionally foment discord and quest for rebel ships in order to fulfil precisely that goal. Much of this sense of life and variety comes only through the flavour text of the quests, but it is all very cleverly conceived and the quests do all have real consequences for the calculations under the hood, for the prosperity and the military fortunes of the AI. If you get tired of questing and manipulating, then you can simply explore and leave the AI to tear eachother to shreds (albeit hopefully without triggering any of the Drox guild's failure conditions).\n\nMy current ship, which I've been running a long time, is level 92, it's in a sector with 10 AI races all with their own grudges and friendships and problems, half of whom are at war with me and half of whom love me (and some of those that like me are at war with me anyway). The sector is so busy with catastrophes and weird developments that the events windows scrolls too fast for me to digest. I know I could fire this game up right now and easily lose several hours enjoyably.\n\nTo be honest, I don't know enough about the ARPG genre itself to make a judgement on the game loot balance, the min-maxing potential, or the diversity of builds available in Drox compared to other games. It feels very deep in this regard - you have stats, racial specialisations, plus a great variety of shield modules, armour modules, instant hit weapons, aimed weapons, minions (drones), buffs, debuffs, hulls and miscellanous doodads (installed in modular fashion). However I don't play enough of this type of game to know whether Drox is really deep or my understanding of ARPG systems is really shallow. I'll leave that aspect for other commenters to examine. All I know is I'm still having a great time with the unpredictable outcomes and three- or four-way battles that Drox Operative sometimes throws up, over a full year since purchase.\n\nA special mention should be made of Soldak's excellent post-release support. The game has been patched regularly throughout this last year or so, while Soldak (creator of Din's Curse and Depths of Peril) has also responded promptly and effectively to community feedback and bug reports. Drox was a fully formed game long before its recent emergence from Greenlight onto Steam. Now it has the benefit of this wider exposure it deserves to be played by as many people as possible, because it's an unsung gem. Clever, addictive and great fun.","March 1, 2014","true","32.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

Other people described it as diablo in space, and not because of the isometric view. However, unlike any other action RPG or just rpg's in general, this is the first that truly made me attempt to balance my build, and I found keeping my ship balanced and functional a rewarding challenge. There are also a lot of different ways to set everything up, for myself I used a combination of rapid fire lasers, missiles, and fighters while slow boating, and unlike most ARPG's, it's very easy to get overwhelmed. The game is very well balanced and put together from what I've seen so far, and that goes a long ways.\n\nVisually the game can be run in 1080p, which makes a difference, and it can look better than the screenshots, but it won't impress anyone. It doesn't seem to have an ongoing story, but rather takes a sandbox approach with very loose winning conditions, ranging from economic and diplomatic methods to conquering and combat oriented methods. Controls for steering the ship aren't what I would consider intuitive, but they are easy enough to pick up using a mouse and keyboard.\n\nWhile the game does have a lot of depth with the political system and other functions, they don't overcomplicate the game, and as long as you make conscientious choices on your allies and enemies, the politics can be largely ignored, and the game plays very arcadish. If you pay attention to the politics and the goings on, it almost feels like the major factions are engaged in a basebuilding RTS and you are there to push whichever sides you choose (not like a MOBA though, they will conquer each other, had one faction out of the running very early in my game), and interfere or ignore as you please. As long as you don't need AAA graphics, or story driven plots, this game will give you a lot of enjoyment.\n","January 1, 2015","true","20.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, you go around collecting loot, killing things and completing quests, but that is where the similarities to ARPGs start to peter out.\n\nThe massive variants of loot, for the most part, are good only for selling. Your ship doesn't have the inventory space or the level required when you start out, so monetise them.\n\nThe in-game currency is VERY useful to achieve your aims of domination in every sector - money talks. Just like in real life, money gives the power to bend others to your will by buying them off. Whether for good or bad, it is always for the benefit of you and the Drox Guild. The horse trading goes both ways so you can take 'gifts' offered from other races if you feel it is to your benefit. Of couse, your next action might be to declare war on them, such are the political machinations of a Drox Operative. Refuse the offer and watch your relationship deteriorate.\n\nKilling and destroying is the typical means to an end. Kill to defend yourself, kill to find loot and gain XP, kill to complete quests and kill for fun. There are various weapon types to choose from but you may just go for the highest damage weapon until you find what you like. There are beam weapons, ballistic weapons, missiles, Electro Magnetic Pulse weapons and more.\n\nQuesting is often an important part of the game, but not always needed. There are 5 different ways to dominate and win your current sector of the galaxy. Using your ship as a club to beat the races into submission will not require you to complete quests to ingratiate yourself with them, However, due to the various ways to win and lose your current sector, using quests to facilitate alliances or some lesser agreement is often the best move. Races can grow too powerful to deal with alone militarily, so maybe ally with another race or two?\n\nIf you win your current sector, you start a new sector and new opportunities of higher risk and reward present themselves. Upgrading your ship is another essential goal, as it provides more inventory slots and better stats. Losing your current sector re-rolls a new sector. In this game, every sector pans out differently as the competing races vie for supremacy while trying to use you as a tool for completing their aims. On the other hand, they'll insult you and try to destroy you if you don't do as they want. Best to play them at their own game and use tactics like Propaganda, Espionage, Sabotage and Rumours to undermine them and weaken their grip on a planet/planets, and thus the system.\n\nThe thought required for this game is quite amazing. So many ways for events to go down and the smart game mechanics make for political intrigue and lots of violence. For me, the way the races are doing what they can to survive, expand or conquer, while I'm trying to dominate is a fantastic game feature. The yelps of delight when a plan works out or the hunkering down for the long haul as a sector hovers in impasse really makes me want to applaud the guys at Soldak.\n\nThere is a lot of content in this game and a lot to learn. It is a bit baffling at first, but well worth the time learning as it is a game of depth and rewarding achievement. A very different game.","March 17","true","285.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's been a fun game so far, although now that I'm getting farther along it is losing some of its lustre.  The only down side I've run into was spawning into a new sector and being completely surrounded and outgunned by a plethora of enemies.  I died over and over until the horde was drawn away by other things to shoot.  Then I limped around in a broken ship until I lost the sector.  Yep, you can lose a sector but keep going with the same ship and items.\n\nEven though the diplomacy system is a bit weak it works better than most space sims with a similar system - becuase sometimes it actually WORKS.  I guess my only complaint is that once you get beyond level 10 or so the items you find beceome so varied and you find so many that you can waste a lot of time reading what each item does and trying to decide what to use, save for later or sell.  I'm sure with time I'll be come used to the item variety and know, much faster, what to keep and what to toss.  You can even put stuff in a shared "stash" so other ships you create can pick it up.\n\nThere are five ways to win a sector, four ways to lose and when the loss conditions are met you get a 10 minuite timer to rectify the situation - if you can - or just zip around and blow up more stuff for xp and loot before the time expires.\n\nYou can often BUY your way to a win if you have enough credits - but not always and it's not always necessary.  So far each sector has felt different in the way things play out.  I even had one sector with all the races in the same star system - let me tell you that was a fast game because they didn't get along.  I had to spend about 30,000 credits (over half of what I had) to convince the last race to ally with me in the last 3 seconds so I wouldn't lose.

The game is $19.99 normally, and I've seen the winter sale drop it 50% for it and the expansion.","January 4, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You take the role of a Drox operative playing the role of one of several distinct races. Your objective is to win thru several different ways such as an economic victory, diplomacy, military might, etc.\n\nYou can set the game to have the play field small (such as a mere handfull of sectors) to very vast with dozens of sectors to explore. You start out in your 'Home' sector where you will encounter your first race. It is benificial to open up trade agreements with all you encounter at first; but as time progresses and lines in the sand are drawn you will want to work to forge an alliance with the most powerful factions.\n\nYou gain influence with factions by completing quests for them, protecting their planets and ships from attack and trading w/ them. You also lose influince by trading and associating with enemies of factions. Quests can range from assassinitaion to ferrying supplies. Planets can come under all kinds of pressure, from disease/famine/unrest and riots/zombie appocolypse/etc. Each of these problems requires certain cargo to solve so as you pick up the quest you can search the network on where to find the supplies to deliver.\n\nOne neat aspect I likes was the addition of random crew members. they can drop as loot and can be leveled up and assigned to your ship.\n\nThe game has difficulty levels from 1-100 so to reach higher levles with your ship you will need to keep starting over in new sectors and set the diff to higher levels. You also can invest points into your command skill which will unlock bigger ships for you. I personally liked it when I was able to install my first Fighter Bay. I recomend doing ths asap because it really helps having them support your ship. And let me mention all the other types of customization, from EMP pulses to computer virus' to fusion and nuclear mines and missles to all kinds of lasers and beams just to name a few. The sky is the limit when it comes to customization.\n\nIt's worth it to mention all the different encounter types you can come across, from Rogue Elite Mobs to wandering traders to abandoned ships to Minerable Asteroids and Rogue Comets and space pirates to name a few.\n\nIf you like Dungeon Delving (albiet in space) and space exploration and hack and slash button mashing combat, I would recommend giving this a try either for yourself or a 4pack so you and your friends can conquer the stars together.","August 29, 2014","true","30.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You have some interesting diplomacy options that allow you to protect yourself and the ability to sell stolen technologies tied in with a point-and-click, top-down, action-rpg. The mechanics are simple enough to learn, and ship configuration is a series of tough choices adding some good depth.\n\nDownsides of this game are that loot optimization is basically all you're doing, though it is very satisfying. Leveling starts slowing around level 15 and pacing in general can be quite slow at times (Especially when trying to convince 2 of your allies to ally themselves so you can win).\n\nOverall, the game is addicting and, most importantly, fun.

Otherwise, you go to "YOU'RE GONNA F ING LOSE in 10 minutes!" countdown mode.\n\nBasically, the game tells you when things are so screwed, that you are going to lose the game...in 10 minutes.\nThat's nice.\nHowever, to fix issues with other races killing each other (over the smallest, stupidest things), often involves doing quests for them. "OK, so DRAAK says, go explore THAT PLANET, in THAT SYSTEM", but it WILL TAKE YOU FOREVER TO FLY THERE.\n\nNot to mention all the hostile mobs that will spawn and spam you with their weapons along the way.\n\nGAWD, you fly sooooooooooooooo slooooooooooooooooooooooow in this game.\nEven with equipment to boost your speed, it's barely noticeable.\n\nThe game is supposed to be in a galaxy, but it's really a "sector".\nIf you lose, you are pretty much told you suck and can continue...in a new sector!\n\nSectors are designed by mentally impaired chimpanzees.\nOne of them, was literally a STRAIGHT F NG LINE.\n\nI now present, the DROX OPERATIVE rendition of the song: "Dem Bones"\n"The A system is connected to the...B system,\nthe B system is connected to the...C system,\nthe C system is connected to the...D system,\nnow hear the word of Soldak!"\n\nAlso, your system radar is smelly like a dirty behind.\nYou have to fly around forever to clear the "fog of the star system" to find anything.\nEven better, it only marks where you found planets and jump gates, and not stations, recharge stations (critical, because after firing like 10 laser shots, your ships out of power and it might say you recharge 2pts. per second, and your laser costs 10pts. to fire, and so in 5 seconds, you can fire. Meanwhile, you have surplus of power!....WHO DESIGNED THIS VOMIT PILE OF ORAFICE GUNK?).\n\nSo, while you're spammed with messages from the AI nations, and all their problems, and unable to get to them all, and going to lose the game unless you...read the strategy guides? Well, any game you have to go online to figure out how to F NG play it, or read a plethora of strategy guides, hints, how to mod or to download mods (most are all hosted on sites that require you sign-up so they can sell all of your information like Facebook), well, then that game is a not a GAME but an AT-HOME WORK PROJECT.\n\nYou can have more fun FAPPING to an Excel Spreadsheet than mess with this junk.\n\nAnd it's sad because they tried to make it real simple.\nEven has an option to use a Joystick.\nNo, not for fapping, but controlling your ship.\nThere is no auto-flight, but rather you must keep your finger pressed to move.\nYou can't select an area of the map either. Only immediate objects to auto-fly/move/chug to them.\nThat's totally lame.\nYou will sprain your fricken finger and then your fapping-self (or your lady friend) are over for a good time being.\n\nSimple, cool things: it's like Diablo in space. Random, varied loot items drop to add to your ship's stuff.\n\nOf course, you're not equipping a dude or dudette, but a ship.\nBut they catagorize "equipemtn slots" by stupid bleeding colors: Green slot, Yellow slot stuff, Red slot stuff, Orange slot stuff.\nFor some reason, you can have Armor plates that are "Yellow slot stuff" but then others that are "Red slot stuff".\nI didn't notice any stack but then again, all the info is all over the place and game seems prone to stat bugs, who knows what I was looking at?\n\nYou can get "chips", like "gems" to socket items, but the game makes it such a tedious, poorly explained chore, you'd think you just click and slide it in the thing, but no, that just can't be simple. LOL. One time, an item I was using I realized had an empty slot. I couldn't do it while equipped. I moved to my inventory...now it doesn't say it has an empty slot? WTH?\n\nSo, you'll run into all kinds of junk like that.\nEndless trash loot. They have colors for loot type: Grey, Green, Yellow, etc. so that adds to the confusion.\nAll that stuff sucks too. I've had Grey items 5x better than Green, Yellow, for example.\n\nEven on the easiest settings, you'll lose, die a few times, but mostly, you'll quickly find this game so frustrating, just trying to do 1 thing, when INEXPLICABLY, everyone declares WAR on each other AND YOU.\nAnd then you're going to F NG lose the game...in 10 minutes.\n\nAlso, the more you level up, the less XP you get per kill and longer it takes, to where it becomes a really horrible grind.\nEspecially for a single-player game.\nIf this was a PTP MMO, this would make sense, even making travel SO SLOW THAT TURTLES WILL FEED BAD FOR YOU, it would all make sense.\n\nInstead, nah, they'd rather bork your experience by 86'ing all fun from this.\n"OH LOOK, COOL EXPLOSIONS! UH, wait? I did a quest to deliver a package to the Humans and the Draak and Dryad empires got so panty-knotted, even though my relations with them were high for all the quests I did for them, that they declare are on us? Just like THAT?! Uhhh. Is this a 'fun' game or just a tr0ll that polymorphed into a game? Why do I feel like reading junk mail will be more fun at this point?"\n\n*DROXXORED*","December 10, 2015","false","5.1"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","7","13","5","0"

I really honestly do. I love the concept. I love flying around in space shooting ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBut honestly, this game fails on a lot of levels. It just misses the mark in a lot of glaring ways.\n\n1) Scaling: I understand that a "boss" monster is gonna be tough, but when he's got 10x your health/shields/whatever and can do vastly more damage per hit than you can (to the tune of damn near 1shotting you), it just takes the fun out of it for me.\n\n2) Speed: Enemy ships can and will outrun your bullets; missiles i could understand, but bullets ought to be a lot faster than they are. Additionally, enemy ships (even MASSIVE boss ships) are capable of going WAY faster than player ship. They will go ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ across the screen in crazy circles etc. making them unhittable via most weapon types.\n\n3) Energy: It is your enemy. Your ship will be permanently sucking wind. If i had most of my hardpoints dedicated to weapons, was cycling all of them on cooldown, and had no energy regen items installed, i can understand energy problems. That is NOT the case, a single decent laser will suck down as much energy as your whole ship can produce, including several installed energy regen devices. Get used to sucking down energy consumables on cooldown during fights.\n\n4) AI races: They basically all hate each other, and you. War is the default state in each sector. Someone will be mad at you virtually all the time.\n\n5) Victory conditions: Game has great array of victory conditions, several of which are nigh unusable. A diplomatic victory requires you to be allied with multiple AI races, who must be allied with each other. After playing over a dozen sectors, i've only seen 2 computer races allied once, and it didnt last very long before i got drug into the resulting war. Economic victory requires you to accumulate a ♥♥♥♥pile of wealth via quests etc. I've never been more than 1/3 of the way to that victory before the AI races have killed each other off and quests collapse in number. Simplest victories are to kill enough AI race ships/planets to become "feared", or ally with the dominant race and help them kill off everyone else.\n\nBottom line is that i just dont feel at all like a "hero" in this game. AI ships play by different rules, allowing them to be much stronger than the game allows me to be. Not a very rewarding experience in a game that aims itself at being a fun shooting time waster.","September 18, 2015","false","65.1"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","16","32","0","0"

Keep moving.\n\nThis is a ♥♥♥♥ing grind fest with a space skin on it, nothing more.\n\nThink Borderlands, with no plot. All there is to this game is grind for XP, grind for better random items, that's it.\n\nIt also shows strong evidence of no playtesting. There's no attempt to make this game fun. Expect to get one-hit killed many many times when you get to level 50. It starts getting quite unbalanced about that point. I found an enemy that had health regeneration that was higher than my DPS, and I had put about 40% of my points into tactical (the damage stat).\n\nAlso, it is not possible to max out your character, there are 6 skills, and enough levels + points to max out 2 of them, assuming you put absolutely no points into anything else.\n\nGraphics are pretty rough, which probably wont bother you if you're looking for a 2D space combat game, sadly however the frame rate stuttered quite often on my as of 2014 US$3000 PC.\n\nThat may be your cup of tea, but it sure as ♥♥♥♥ is not mine.\n\nAvoid like the plague.","May 6, 2014","false","5.1"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","17","37","0","0"

This game is neither of these things.\n\nYou are the last of the Drox race, a once mighty Empire that was all but destroyed in a war. You only have one ship, you don't build more and you don't colonize planets. Your goal is to figure out which AI race will emerge as the strongest race and brown-nose them, by doing quests for them. A race might ask you to find a replacement power supply for a planet or smuggle in hand-held weapons, to quell subsequent riots. It sounds more interesting than it actually is, since it is just a case of buying an item from a specific vendor and then transporting it to the specific planet.\n\nFiguring out which race will emerge victorious is not difficult, since you have 100% intelligence gathering, regarding Empire strength. Some races lack social skills, or are fickle, or aggressive. I knew how the second game would play out, after losing the first. The race traits don't change between games, so that will completely kill any longevity.\n\nYou spend most of your time flying around, at the speed of a snail, exploring derelict ships, in an attempt to uncover the fog of war. Random ships and races will attack you. Combat consists of spamming the 1 key because the other two weapons in the game are worthless, by comparison. Finding random loot and juggling items was fun in the first game but you figure out how to min / max the game in a couple of hours.\n\nThis game was a waste of time and money, to the point that I highly recommend playing the demo or avoiding it altogether. I wish that I could get my money back. Play whatever is the best Space Rangers game out there.\n\n\nMaster of Orion 2 is still the best 4x game ever:\n\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/master_of_orion_1_2\n\n\nAlpha Centauri is also an excellent 4x game:\n\nhttp://www.gog.com/game/sid_meiers_alpha_centauri","December 24, 2014","false","6.9"," 1 of 16 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","16","0","0"

In practice this seems to work, there are AI civilizations fighting, colonizing and entering into diplomacy and you can influence and effect things, sabotage races you want to lose, or just join in an all-out fight, pick a side to ally with and destroy their enemies. Easy enough to pick up and there's depth to keep you playing. Its a really good idea, the game has a lot of charm, and when it works is a lot of fun. Diablo-like, this is a point and click shooter with a streamlined leveling system and crate-loads of loot.\n\nThe trouble is its as buggy as hell, and at 2+ years old there really shouldn't be such blatant bugs. I keep getting quests to colonize non-existent planets, to destroy non-existent enemies and half the time complete quests I wasn't even set (which is a nice XP boost, sure, but confusing!) Imagine hunting a bounty in Diablo 3 having being told they are in Westmarch Commons. You spend an hour looking for them only to get bored, go elsewhere, and discover the bounty was actually in Desolate Sands.\n\nIt looks like the main issue is that the game randomly generates each sandbox sector for you to explore, and simply gets muddled by the amount of random info. being generated. It means a lot of aimless wandering, and wiki visiting to find out where you are actually supposed to be. The other trouble is that it is very easy to win a sector (I hope it gets harder as I level up), I just keep buying victories, paying off the most powerful race to be my ally. I also felt the inventory options were limited, while these can be expanded, even when I had four cargo bays I was leaving a lot of litter spread around the galaxy (never mind the fact that none of the vendors ever have enough money to buy goods from you!) Add to this the fact that there are random wormholes everywhere. They always seem to catapult me to a part of the galaxy well above my current level and seem to be a random 'insta-death' function that you cannot avoid. Finally, I have scoured the options and menus and cannot find any information about how many experience points you have and how many are needed to level up. These are all very minor quibbles, but considering the number of indie Diablo-clones out there that are far more polished (and cheaper, or even free!) these add up to disappointment.\n\nRecommended with caveats and a hope that a future patch fixes some of these issues.","December 6, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would be nice if the loot wasn't so random; at least a percentage needs to be geared towards where you are and race specific. It is very difficult to "upgrade" because vendors options are nearly useless, which means you rely on "drops" for upgrades. Some of these, depending on your race, can be very problematic to procure. This is especially true for power...you either have too much or not nearly enough. Regardless. Minor issues overall. I've played about 50 hours so far and I can see myself getting bored pretty quick because it turns into a "grind fest", but so far it's been a decent game.","July 7, 2014","true","67.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Shove them in a blender with a little Privateer and a little Terraria and you have Drox Operative.    The entire point of this game is to be the most important unimportant person in the universe.\n\nThe game itself is a 4x game that you aren't playing.   Sure, you can fight, trade, engage in diplomacy, and build up your ship, but the actual 4x game is being played by the AI.   Your job is to represent the mysterious Drox, a race with the goal of ensuring they can always manipulate each galaxy from the shadows.    Your ships persist inventory and stats similarly to Terraria and each time you fly to a new universe, you leave the old behind.\n\nThe win condition is to ensure that the Drox are allied with the "last man standing"; in other words, either help a race/alliance of races conquer the galaxy through diplomacy or war, or kill everyone in the game that isn't you.   Completion alongside special directives from Drox Command gets you bonuses to help you along the way in the next mission, and the level cap can take a small forever to reach.   Except at hardcore difficulties, death doesn't end the game; only having the entire universe hate the Drox and not fix that condition before time runs out can forcibly end a world.\n\nUnfortunately, while the replayability is high, the gameplay gets samey.   You *will* end up at war with someone, probably because of an ill-chosen alliance early on.   You will also see lots of space monsters, most of which are really just pirate ships, but some are irritiatingly biological for being in space.  The level cap is high but it's unlikely you'll reach it with one ship before moving to another.  The best way to deal with combat is long range weapons and kiting your opponents or shelling them from a distance.    On my nVidia 760GTX's in SLI, the "advanced graphic" option that creates a lot of pretty effects in space just reveals that the designers got lazy and made the ships partially transparent so it would look like they were "in" the nebulaic clouds.   TO be fair, this may have been a limitation of the dated graphics engine.\n\nDefinitely a good game at the price, highly recommended for a game to go to when you want to be a manipulative jerk in a 4x game.   Don't get it and expect the second coming of the Starflight series, though.","April 7, 2014","true","139.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In practice this seems to work, there are AI civilizations fighting, colonizing and entering into diplomacy and you can influence and effect things, sabotage races you want to lose, or just join in an all-out fight, pick a side to ally with and destroy their enemies. Easy enough to pick up and there's depth to keep you playing. Its a really good idea, the game has a lot of charm, and when it works is a lot of fun. Diablo-like, this is a point and click shooter with a streamlined leveling system and crate-loads of loot.\n\nThe trouble is its as buggy as hell, and at 2+ years old there really shouldn't be such blatant bugs. I keep getting quests to colonize non-existent planets, to destroy non-existent enemies and half the time complete quests I wasn't even set (which is a nice XP boost, sure, but confusing!) Imagine hunting a bounty in Diablo 3 having being told they are in Westmarch Commons. You spend an hour looking for them only to get bored, go elsewhere, and discover the bounty was actually in Desolate Sands.\n\nIt looks like the main issue is that the game randomly generates each sandbox sector for you to explore, and simply gets muddled by the amount of random info. being generated. It means a lot of aimless wandering, and wiki visiting to find out where you are actually supposed to be. The other trouble is that it is very easy to win a sector (I hope it gets harder as I level up), I just keep buying victories, paying off the most powerful race to be my ally. I also felt the inventory options were limited, while these can be expanded, even when I had four cargo bays I was leaving a lot of litter spread around the galaxy (never mind the fact that none of the vendors ever have enough money to buy goods from you!) Add to this the fact that there are random wormholes everywhere. They always seem to catapult me to a part of the galaxy well above my current level and seem to be a random 'insta-death' function that you cannot avoid. Finally, I have scoured the options and menus and cannot find any information about how many experience points you have and how many are needed to level up. These are all very minor quibbles, but considering the number of indie Diablo-clones out there that are far more polished (and cheaper, or even free!) these add up to disappointment.\n\nRecommended with caveats and a hope that a future patch fixes some of these issues.","December 6, 2014","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although not flashy, it has heart, creativity, fun, reward, and innovation in spades. The play is direct and simple as is typical for ARPGs but very deep and customizable, and the choices of what equipment to keep and what to trade away goes well beyond simply choosing which bauble has the biggest numbers on it. The best adjective I can use for this game is 'rewarding'. The experience of playing Drox Operative FAR FAR outstrips the moderate price tag that Texas-based Soldak Entertainment is asking for it.\n\nDrox Operative is a true hidden gem that combines 4x space, ARPG, and resource management into a game that is simple to play, hard to master and always evolving because of the choices you make. All of this combines to make a game that feels alive and dangerous in a way that other ARPGs just don't have. It is an unexpected treasure nestled in a hidden corner of a genre that has many fine offerings. The only disappointing thing about this game is that so few people know about it. With wider coverage this game would be legendary.\n\nIf you love ARPGs but want something that takes the genre to the next level, play the free demo.

You customize your starship with modules and then go out and kill space monsters for loot and experience points. When you levelup you invest in ability points like computers or tactical rather than strength or dexterity. Basic module types like shields, weapons, thrusters, etc exist, but there are a lot of other different types of modules, especially at later levels.\n\nYou get quests, sell loot and engage in diplomacy with AI empires that are playing a little automatic 4x game. It's a nice touch because it makes the game world dynamic. In addition the quests you get are based on the state of the 4x game, and succeeding in them or failing to complete them in time have natural consequences for the strength of AI empires and the random monsters.\n\nThere's also some depth to it because the other empires engage in diplomacy with each other and you can influence this by spreading rumors which change relations and supporting empires economicly.\n\nThe developer of this game also made Depths of Peril and a few other similar games, so if you've played that you have a pretty good idea of the gameplay concepts involved.\n\nThis is their best game yet though, I enjoy it a lot more than DoP and will probably play it in short sessions for a long time to come.","March 29, 2014","true","18.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
