"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuscusNight/recommended/200170/","FuscusNight","FuscusNight","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuscusNight/","257 products in account","It's a 2D Worms game but with a 3D engine, unlike previous Worm games in the past ,objects you see sticking out of the terrain in a map now have physics properties, they can bounc around,crush other worms,explodes,emit poison gas or even throw water around and there's now a seperate water in the game that also has some very nice looking physics to it when it moves around, this water doesn't instant kill your worms like the regular water at the bottom of the map but instead drains 1-3 HP per turn if a worm is submerged in it and everything in it moves slower (both worms and projectiles).\nThere's also now classes in the game, Scout,Heavy and Scientists (+ the normal worm).\nHeavy is the slowest but can take the most abuse\nScout is the fastest,has the highest jumps and can perform some crazy maneuvers while walking thru terrain buuut has the lowest HP and dies the fastest\nThe Scientist is pretty much a healer, each turn he heals  5hp and that's about it.\n\nHowever if you don't wanna play with these new classes you can just simply play the Classic mode where every worm is a regular worm like in the older games.\n\n\nThat's pretty much it, everything else is the same, It's the Worms game we all know and love since the 90's.\nOnly major complaint i have, there's a big lack of enviroments, all you have is Beach,Sewers,Horror and a 4th one which i can't remember the name of atm, while in older Worms games you usully had at least 6 to 10 (sometimes more) enviroments for a map to keep things abit more esteticly different each time.\n\nBottom line, it's still Worms but with a new makeover and some new fun things added it. Totally worth picking up during a nice sale and playing a few matches with your friends either via the internet or on a single computer.","November 11, 2014","true","19.4"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","40","43","0","0"

You never can predict what will going on. Those tiny little worms , stuck in pixels and dies like a water drops. With a dozen fun weapons.\nps: there was also a upgraded version of Armageddon ITS FUN!\n\n- WORMS 3D (all other versions)\nIts was something new, still fun but not in the same way. (if it was in 2015 , it would be a good game after years of polishing). For me it was special, not like before... but i played it cause i like worms. I loved a big big high platforms and unpredictable shooting.\n\n- WORMS Revolution\nThey tried to restore a Armageddon fun and they kinda made it! Thanks TEAM17\n\nPros:\n- Cool polished graphics\n- If you pass a single mode, you are the master.\n- Fun\n- Challenges\n- Every time i play worms with friend, even with skills you never know who will win.\n\nCons\n- THE TIME of calculation of a AI is too LONG!\n- THE AI is too predictable and really mathematically aiming (that is not fun)\n- The water is not a water; its gelatin\n- Many weapons are gone\n- Not a full destructible area (in old worms it was something that i loved to do , hit a Aliluia grenade and it will blow a half of the level with several mini impacts, but here is not the same)\n- No one never is online, poor multi player.\n- Cant play single player maps with my friends..\n\nVERDICT:\nIf you need a challenge try WORMS\nif you love UNPREDICTABLE moments, try WORMS.\nIf you never played WORMS, you must try WORMS.","May 25, 2015","true","27.3"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","83","49","59","12","0"

With a polished presentation, attractive visuals and improved level design, we finally have a Worms game that doesn't feel like it emerged from a '90s time-capsule. The series remains as polarizing as ever, but those who enjoy the zany antics of the series will dig Worms Revolution.There's no revolution in this new installment of Team 17's beloved franchise, but tons of fun and crazy gadgets. New features need a good improvement if they are meant to stick around, but single and multiplayer contents will make fans happy for a bit.Worms Revolution is as good as the franchise has ever been.","April 8, 2014","true","18.4"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","5"

As a long term Worms fan , I waited so long for a 2D release. ( 3D version were fun too, especially Mayhem and Forts ).\nFantastic game to play with a friends , be it local or online.\n\nGraphic is amazing. I love background map effects, where everything moves and feels more alive. Addition of a narrator is damn sweet too. I really like him, makes the singleplayer campaign a lot more enjoyable.\n\nAlso I liked the new Worms class system ( normal worm,heavy,scientist and scout ). Each one provides a different boosts/bonuses so you can customize your team as much as you like or you preffer. Add to this Worm customization stuff like cosmetics, voice,grave or dance.\nThere is also a in-game shop so you can buy new weapons or supplies when you run out of ammo in your match. Of course first you need to find a coins on the map.\n\nAbout weapons. You will find the old ones but there are few new weapons , like protection shield , ufo , flamethrower etc. and newest addition of the "Watery" weapons. Yes Worms Revolution has a water physics , that means you can shoot a water from your water pistol, call a water bomb airstrike and drown your enemies. A perfect weapon to get rid of bunkering worms.\n\nIt really adds some freshness to the game.\n\nJust too bad AI is kinda meh, they still stand like a artillery and noscope you with a bazookas and grenades 24/7. Despite having a inventory full of weapons.\nI haven't found any premade maps? Are there none? Only random maps are available?

The game works well online aswell however I have not spent much time doing that. I found the single player campain to be boring and I have never finished it. I would not suggest getting this game if you are only planning on playing alone. As a multiplayer game I love it. I have spent way more than 21 hours (as the time played suggest) playing this game. Steam just dosen't track time played offline.\n\nOne complaint I have is that the expansion packs should have really just come with the game to begin with. They add little to the game except fill out the weapon variety a bit. I do have all the expansions though. Fortunatly it is all resonably priced though.\n\nDespite those small complaints this is a great game to play with some friends.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/recommended/200170/","Loganesquire","*Logan*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/","59 products in account","Worms Revolution is one of the best Worms games available today.\n\nI have been playing the Worms series since 1996, starting with Worms 1 on the Sega Saturn, so I am no stranger to this series.\n\nIf YOU are new to this series, or curious about the new additions, you are basically controlling a team of 1-8 worms (depending on game settings) in a battle to the death with some of the craziest weapons ever.\nWeapons such as the Old Lady, Holy Hand Grenade, Super Sheep, Concrete Donkey, Bazooka,etc will be used as your team fights to the death in a turn-based battle with a time limit per turn and round.\n\nYou also get to use a variety of utilities to move around the map such as a Ninja Rope, Jetpack, Teleport, etc.\n\nYou have the option of making your own gamestyles with extensive customization settings, and this game also offers you the ability to make your own maps and play them online.\n\nSome new features for this version from other Worms series include dynamic water, new interactive physics objects, and new weapons and utilities. Yes, the rope behaves differently, (think bungee cord) but once you get used to this change you will not want to go back to the stiff rope of past worms versions.\n\nNow let's talk about system performance. Worms Revolution as you may of noticed, wants at least a dual core processor and a good video card. I have used a Pentium 4 3.60 Ghz in the past, and I was getting very playable framrates. A slow dual core seems to run this game very well paired with a good video card.\n\nYes, there are bugs in this game involving the new physics objects, and possibly annoying aspects relating to controls, but they are mostly minor. Voice Chat works well.\n\nThere is an active community online to this day, and adding friends to your friends list who play the game can help ensure full four player games often.\nThere is A Solo Campaign you need to play to earn coins to buy new classes of Worms. Your scores will also be recorded on Steam Leaderboards. This game has classes for your worms that helps them specialize in certain situations, such as stronger attacks from a Heavy, quicker movements with a Scout, or stronger tools with Scientists.\n\nIf you like the Worms series, or if this style of gameplay sounds even slightly interesting, I highly recommend you give this a look.","May 23, 2014","true","687.7"," 42 of 63 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","42","63","0","2"

People who have never played Worms games will find this a good place to jump in. It's the same old Worms 2-d turn based "armor" fighting game, but T17 have tried to add some new elements to a franchise which has been reusing mostly the same gameplay since the 90s, and you know what, it works. The games never felt like they needed more added, but it really had to be done to make a new worms game that felt fresh. And you know what, the new additions feel right and go along great with the classic worms gameplay. And that gameplay feels right this time. Reloaded didn't really have that right feel, but this one successfully combines new and old to make something great. The campaign even is the best that its been, still unnecessary, but entertaining. Everyone knows that the old fashioned skirmish is the best way to enjoy Worms.\n\nOverall, this game is a great way to spend a half hour in a explosive, strategic (I know, I know, but I'm a darksider), and now, very wet affair.","October 12, 2014","true","1.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Some people say that Worms is a multiplayer game, and you're supposed to play it with other players, but I see nothing wrong with playing Worms solely for the single player campaign. If you do, just think of Worms as a sort of puzzle game, and you will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of it. Some of the missions were frustatingly difficult thanks to the incredibly accurate AI, but that just made completing them feel that much more rewarding.\n\nI played this game at the same time as I was playing Worms Clan Wars, and in my opinion Worms Revolution is by far the superior game. You can read my review of Worms Clan Wars here. I gave that game a negative review, not because I think it is a very bad game, but because this one is, in my opinion, so much better - and quite a bit cheaper as well.\n\nHere's a few of the pros of Worms Revolution:\n- The narrator (which is actually funny in this game, unlike that annoying woman in Worms Clan Wars)\n- Plenty of challenging missions\n- Interesting weapons (the only weapon that I missed was the Teleportation Gun from Clan Wars)\n- Water physics\n\nI can't really think of any big cons. The new worm-classes (Soldier, Scientist, Scout, Heavy) were a nice addition, although not really necessary in my opinion. It can also be a bit hard to find people online, especially if you want to play  a ranked match.\n\nStill, I definitely recommend this game.\n\n→　If you are the type of person who cares about achievements, note that there are several multiplayer achievements in this game, which can be a bit troublesome to get.","March 2","true","48.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This makes moving around terrain very difficult. Bot's aim's is perfect. They use bazooka and granate, and they make incredible shoots. When you play campaign, you have limited (25 sec) to move around and aim. While bot's are so good at sniping you that they don't need to move around. Multiple bomb bounces that bot's make is something human mind could not calculate in most cases, at all, even if you had 5 minutes of time. Or shooting straight in the air, getting bazooka rocked to fall down through 2 narrow holes that were drilled by bunker buster boomb. It's simply insane.\n\nThis lead to a lot of quitting in rage on my behalf. For me fun has been taken out of this game in campaign part of game. Multiplayer is good as always. Playing with friends, there is only few games that can match this level of fun.\n\nPuzzles... some are insanely difficult.\n\n\nOf course when you play your custom settings where you can allow yourself more time for turn that can still be fun. Water bombs and water damage is new to me, i find it interesting.\n\nOverall, I'm not not that happy with the game. If you are player who played W.Armaggedon, consider trying demo before buying. I would not buy simply for the fact that they ruined use of rope.\n\nPositive is new type of worms, and some fun new weapons and utilities. Get to know all weapons and utilities first, then play this game. Play puzzles after tutorial, you will discover some interesting use of utility faster than if you go straight to multiplayer or campaign.","February 17, 2014","true","42.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

(WTF???????).\nThe game's 'random shooting into walls' concept that was rare in previous editions is very common now. I can work out whether the enemy worm is about to hit me using this:\nGrenade: Direct hit\nBazooka: Hit, but if a wall is in the way, it will hit the wall\nThe worms almost never use any other weapon.\n\nWhilst terrain editor is back (finally), it is a very simplified version of the old worms games.\nThe ninja rope (whilst more realistic), is now almost useless for proper ninja-like stunts.\nIt is quite expensive (although luckily i got it along with the Humble Bundle).\nWorm customization is not as varied as it was before. In particular, the voices of worms sound very similar, almost indistinguishable.\nPlus, instead of WORKING OUT how to do the puzzles and missions and thinking of tactics ON YOUR OWN, when you start the mission it SHOWS YOU HOW TO COMPLETE IT. WHY??!!!!?!??!??!?!?!!?\nWorms will always avoid crates.\n\nVerdict: a ok game, but many people who want a challenge would prefer older games like Worms Armageddon and Worms Open warfare 2.\n\nRating: 5/10","February 10, 2014","false","22.8"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Design your own maps and terrain.\n\n- Online competitive modes and a large campaign which tests your skills is always appreciated.\n\n- New breeds of worms have been included, a feature that I particularly enjoyed! Your team now offers more in terms of specific roles for your Worms and requires a little more strategic organisation.\n\n- Continuous commentary throughout engages you, though personally I found this irritating, a little too 'dumbed-down' for my liking.\nLuckily this mainly exists through Adventure Mode, so not too bad otherwise.\n\n\nI can see the appeal to bring the series forward into the 3D era, unfortunately, this kills it a bit for me as a player of the original 2D side-scroller.\nPerhaps a little too reminiscent?\n\n\nIn this case, the original Worms Armageddon feels to be the best, still, you can expect to get a lot of enjoyment from Worms Revolution.","June 19, 2014","true","8.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The new additions to the gameplay experience include four different classes, dynamic water, and physics objects, but none of the changes radically alter the familiar Worms experience.\n\nThe Worms Formula: For those who don't know, the meat of any Worms game is a turn-based strategy / shooter experience where you control a team of worms and move around a map (or utilize your worms' positions) in order to use weapons such as the explosive Sheep and the famous Holy Hand Grenade to eliminate enemy worms. All Worms games have no small measure of humor, as you'd expect upon hearing the premise, and the worms themselves contribute to the humor with their own gibberish vocalizations as they taunt enemy worms and panic if a stick of dynamite is set next to them. The weapons are of course part of the humor, and the Sheep and the Holy Hand Grenade aren't even the wackiest among them. At the core, however, the gameplay experience would make for a good time in multiplayer play even without the abundant humor.\n\nNew Additions (Classes, Dynamic Water, and Physics Objects):\n\nClasses: The four classes of Worms include the basic soldier, the weaker but more nimble scout, the scientist, who provides a health bonus in turn for being weaker, and the slower but stronger and more resillient heavy.\n\nDynamic Water: The new dynamic water is an option utilized as a stage hazard and fired by three new weapons. Any worm who is knocked into dynamic water will take steady damage over time, instead of instantly drowning upon contact with normal water. Dynamic water utilizes real-world physics, sinking to the lowest area possible given its location and trajectory.\n\nPhysics Objects: Physics Objects are relatively normal objects scattered around every map. The twist, however, is that each object explodes when sufficiently damaged. In the process, they unleash fires, poison gas, or even dynamic water into the immediate vicinity.\n\nVerdict and Recommendation: The wacky action of the Worms franchise is spruced up a bit by the new enhancements. None of the features radically alter the core experience, however, meaning that those who tried another Worms game but found it to be only interesting as a novelty or altogether unappealing need not apply. Worms Revolution is as good of a starting point as any for series newcomers, though, and those who enjoyed previous installments should find plenty to like here. If you are undecided, keep in mind that Worms Revolution is first-and-foremost a multiplayer experience, and the singleplayer campaign is decent, but it presents nothing to sway your decision.\n\ntl;dr version: Worms 'Revolution' is no revolution, but the perennial Worms formula didn't need to be signficantly altered anyways.","June 27, 2014","true","7.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

To me the weapon arsenal didn't feel that satisfying, compared to Worms 3D (which is the game I have played the most) which had the Homing Pigeon and Super Cow for example. To me the lack of this kind of weaponry is a major con, together with the "meh" level design, the kind of superfluous class feature, and the thin campaign. Revolution is a game I still can recommend though since the core Worms feeling is definitely there, even better if you have good company to enjoy the game with!\n\nIf you are unsure whether to get this game or not, I would personally wait for Worms W.M.D. to come out, hopefully it will be a real beast when it comes out, keep the fingers crossed\n\nIf you have some good friends to play Worms Revolution with and the new features seem like something for you definitely get this game on sale. I feel it's quite overpriced at 14,99€ which is the price right now.\n\nAll in all I give Worms Revolution a 6/10 + extra points if you have some buddies to battle","April 15","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The best part about Worms, in my opinion, was that you were free tomake it as fair or unfair as you wanted. The old school games had the perfect mix of control and chaos, making each game an unpredictable but fun mess. This game, with it's addition of worm "classes", needless excuses for DLC, and phoned-in humor makes it a chore to play.

Players can choose between single player campaign, offline skirmishes, or online games with friends so there is never a shortage of carnage.\n\nThe campaign isn't very long, with around 32 missions (not including missions added from DLC) but you'll be laughing through-out the entire length of it. The AI isn't a push over either, if you're as bad as I am at least, and will definitely have you hiding in the caves if you're not careful. The narrator of the campaign is a bit...annoying to say the least, but the voices from the worms make up for it in the end.\n\nWorms Revolution brings a new style of gameplay into the mix by adding classes to the classic worms game. Each class has it's own benefits to offer and can be the deciding factor on a major victory....or a horrible loss. The four classes available are Scout, Heavy, Soldier, and Scientist. Some of the benefits the classes offer are increased movement speed, increase jump height/distance, team-wide health regeneration, etc.\n\nPhysics objects are also a big game changer in Worms Revolution, adding objects that are highly volatile (more so than the common oil drum), or that contain dynamic liquid that you could use to literally wash away the competition. Unfortunately it seems that some of the classic weapons have been removed from the base game but others are offered in the available DLC.\n\nAll in all the game is loads of fun and it never seems to be the same game twice. I definitely recommend this game to anything looking for some casual fun offline, or for those who wish to duke it out with their friends in an epic online war and truly test friendships.","July 8, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Players can choose between single player campaign, offline skirmishes, or online games with friends so there is never a shortage of carnage.\n\nThe campaign isn't very long, with around 32 missions (not including missions added from DLC) but you'll be laughing through-out the entire length of it. The AI isn't a push over either, if you're as bad as I am at least, and will definitely have you hiding in the caves if you're not careful. The narrator of the campaign is a bit...annoying to say the least, but the voices from the worms make up for it in the end.\n\nWorms Revolution brings a new style of gameplay into the mix by adding classes to the classic worms game. Each class has it's own benefits to offer and can be the deciding factor on a major victory....or a horrible loss. The four classes available are Scout, Heavy, Soldier, and Scientist. Some of the benefits the classes offer are increased movement speed, increase jump height/distance, team-wide health regeneration, etc.\n\nPhysics objects are also a big game changer in Worms Revolution, adding objects that are highly volatile (more so than the common oil drum), or that contain dynamic liquid that you could use to literally wash away the competition. Unfortunately it seems that some of the classic weapons have been removed from the base game but others are offered in the available DLC.\n\nAll in all the game is loads of fun and it never seems to be the same game twice. I definitely recommend this game to anything looking for some casual fun offline, or for those who wish to duke it out with their friends in an epic online war and truly test friendships.","July 8, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But still guys, it's WORMS, one of the legendary games and it is still FUN!\n\nCons:\n- ninja rope and homing missile physics\n- probably the smaller worms ability to slide on the surface (seems to me like they don't slide as much as in the previous worms games, but as I said that's all part of the physics thing - you can get used to it)\n\nPros:\n+ new utilities related to new objects in the worms environment\n+ water/ability to flood worms - weapons related with that\n+ new classes - 4 different types of worms with different skills\n+ easy level editor\n\nOverall I like this game, you can get over the physics and learn how to use new weapons and worm classes for new tactics.\nscore: 85/100\n","September 2, 2013","true","96.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJ815/recommended/200170/","RJ815","RJ815","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RJ815/","500 products in account","While others have maligned Revolution for straying from the 2D roots of Worms while also simultaneously somewhat sticking to the popularly disliked 3D period of the franchise (in graphics, if no longer in gameplay), I personally found it fresh enough to be a tentatively recommended experience for Worms fans (though note I also have less of a grudge against the 3D Worms games than many other people). It's far from perfect (e.g. I personally found the single-player level narration from "Don Keystone" to be repetitious and unfunny probably 80 - 90% of the time), but I felt it was still decent enough if you can pick up the game for a reasonable price (I got my copy plus DLC from the Team 17 Humble Weekly Sale, for instance).\n\nWater is perhaps the most notable new feature of Revolution, and it appropriately features prominently in the logo for the game. Now, many previous Worms games featured instant kill water at the bottom of the level, but Revolution mixes things up by additionally allowing "dynamic water" to be present on regular terrain. Dynamic water isn't immediately deadly and instead works similar to a slow-acting poison (with more traditional poison weapons and effects also present in this game and other Worms games), slowly damaging any worms that are submerged and helping to win the war of attrition against worms that are not quite killed within a single turn. That's far from the only strategic use of water though, as it can be invaluable for putting out fires, washing worms into the instant kill water, and even functioning as a "soft landing" for any worms jumping or falling from high above. I feel it takes a while to fully appreciate the utility of water, especially because it tends to be far less direct than the more classic weapons like bazookas and grenades, but ultimately I feel it was a worthwhile addition to the game and not just some gimmick.\n\nSpeaking of gimmicks, I'm less sold on the need for "specialist" worms. Revolution, unlike various other Worms games, features four different types or classes of worms: the Soldier, the Heavy, the Scout, and the Scientist. The Soldier is your classic worm, all around decent at everything but not particularly great at any one thing. The Heavy is a brute, dealing the most damage (sometimes impressively so with the more powerful weapons) but suffering dramatically in terms of navigation (though repeated jumps can alleviate this somewhat). The Scout is exactly the opposite, featuring the best movement and navigation abilities but some of the worst damage output. Finally, the Scientist is a bit of an odd duck, granting a small health boost every time it's their turn and with the ability to deploy some utilities better than the other worms, but otherwise is not particularly special in terms of damage output or navigation. Perhaps the differences are more stark in high level multiplayer play, but within the single-player levels I really felt like the regular Soldiers and Heavies were the most useful. Scouts were handy whenever you needed to cross long distances quickly (such as to get an out-of-the-way but quite valuable fixed spawn weapons crate), but their damage output is so pitiful that often the enemy can negate the navigation advantage by outright killing or displacing Scouts easily. I personally almost never saw the need to use Scientists in single-player play, as their slight healing powers are far outweighed by the benefits that a Soldier or Heavy can provide in terms of damage and thinning enemy ranks.\n\nSo, all in all, I found it to be a decent (albeit sometimes frustrating) game, though you might personally enjoy other Worms games more.","November 26, 2013","true","58.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Well let's see. After spending an hour trying to rebind jump from controller button 3 to controller button 2 I had to abandon my efforts all together, even after I'd written all the linked controls down on paper to resolve the conflicts. God knows how they managed to derp it up so badly. The minimum spec listed on the Store page is woefully inaccurate. Where it recommends a dual core with a minimum Radeon HD 3000 series, my quad core 4000 series struggles severely. I'd highly recommend a current era top spec machine if you expect to able to play this. Even then, mouse smoothing is perma enabled resulting in sluggish, unresponsive mouse movement and the joypad too experiences some delay. It's probably the worst Worms title I've ever played and I've played Worms Blast! My advice, avoid this like the plague.","December 28, 2012","false","0.7"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","7"

Gentle pressure or a slight milking action at the base of his ♥♥♥♥ can help to harden him up a bit. Like sword-swollowing, deep-throating takes hours of practice, to relax the gag reflex. For huge ♥♥♥♥♥ it's got to be done in a 69 position so your tongue is right on the helmit, and easily revolves repeatedly around it, in all directions. If you're working upside down on it, the curve of the ♥♥♥♥ more comfortably slides all the way down your throat. Your lips should always cover your teeth, unless he likes for you to bite him a bit, down near the pubes. Gentle biting/pulling of only the loose skin behind the head is allowed. if you start to gag, slow down and think how smooth, warm, soft, and tasty his skin is. ♥♥♥♥♥ can be love-ly.\nThe thing that really drives any man wild is pointing your tongue and working it up, around, and into the hole in his ♥♥♥♥. Whether a guy has an almost tongue-sized hole or a very little one, he'll love you tongueing it out.\nThink of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as a dance routine... you need a quiet, teasing, promising beginning. Then you must use your mouth to 'take possesion' of the whole arena. Raise the energy levels as slowly as possible, as you actually choreograph a long sequence of repititious touches, moves, twists, and shapings, so he never gets bored or loses his climax. But a few rests or slowdowns, at the right times, can prolong and intensify the climax.\nWhen he finally can hold it no longer, just let him rip and roar. And of course you want to swallow his gift to you... it's a part of him and full of energy giving protein.\nif you're lucky, he'll be able to have several more 'go's', as you gently awaken him throughout the night. The very best climaxes come at dawn.","May 3, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

The game title was very popular and many friends told me playing "Worms"  with friends is a lot of fun.\nI like the kind of gameplay in this game and i can enjoy in graphical cartoon designs. But one big disadvantage in my opinion is the fact that you need 3 other people for playing the multiplyer completely. So it was very hard for me as example to play this game with my friends because everybody have to had time to play this game to the same time.\n\nConcluding i would say that you can have a lot of fun with this game but you need friends who have time to play with you.","October 15, 2015","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The 2.5D style I felt really took away from the gameplay, but for reasons I can't put my finger on, other than saying it didn't feel right.\n\nSomebody playing this as their first Worms game might enjoy it, but it isn't for me, an oldschool player.

Update the graphics, add a few classes, and add dynamic terrain features and water physics! Oh, but the curvy graphics make it hard to play precisely, classes feel more like a restriction than an exciting array of options, the water feels insignificant and flows like treacle, and when the terrain features aren't exploding, they just bounce around like balloons. Then, take away a bunch of the weapons and options, cut it down to 16 worms in a match, remove the ability to add custom content, simplify the missions into a glorified, tedious, unrewarding tutorial, and slow the whole thing to a snail's pace. Finally, replace the glorious ninja rope with a limp noodle.\n\nNow, compared to something like Worms Reloaded, it's fine. Unfortunately, Worms Reloaded was an abortion of a game and fails miserably in comparison to the older titles. While Revolution does add a few features to try to distract from the fact that the last solid Worms game came out in 2001, the core gameplay just isn't good enough. Here's hoping we'll someday see a modern Worms title that actually builds up from the classics, instead of trying to start again.\n\nOh, but I nearly forgot!

The single player campaign is easy enough to play at first, but it quickly turns one-sided. The AI worms are unforgiving, and can always pull off logic-defying, perfect shots that a human player could never hope to calculate. Oh sure, they may occasionally miss a shot, but it's all part of their endgame. You will lose. It doesn't help that the odds are firmly stacked against you at all times - your worms are often placed in the worst possible locations on the map, and the AI team always has more worms than you, often more than double. The Spooky levels are where it really becomes next to impossible. Looking for respite, I turned to the puzzles, but sorry, no rest there! The majority of the puzzles (involving using only the tools available to kill certain worms) require absolute, nitpicky precision, and I was only able to get through the later ones with online help. You will fail and fail again. I also sometimes encountered "glitches" in both modes, varying from random, mine-less explosions under my worms to weapons backfiring. The new "Worm classes" also add little to the game, and the much-touted new physics are of little consequence other than with their forced inclusion in the puzzles. I'm convinced that this game was programmed by Satan. Only buy Worms Revolution if you want your blood pressure to skyrocket and your nerves to fray. You have been warned.","October 10, 2014","false","31.5"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

There is little of the original worms (or worms 2) to be seen in this game. The worms themselves allow for customization, which would make you believe that you have more control whereas you in fact have less. The quasi 3D enviroment is no match for the old-school bitmap like maps, making it hard to judge where you can stand/walk/jump, and distracting from the game play. The weapons still work in the same way, but the controls are all over the place and judging wind and compensating for new stuff such as water (and whether it will flow or not) is frustrating. The single player campains later on require you to get every shot and movement correct, with little to no margin for error (made more difficult by the graphics).\n\nIt is not the worst worms-game I have played (worms: a space oddity for the wii takes that spot), but if you want a blast from the past, I'd suggest going for the versions released for android rather than this.","October 24, 2014","false","9.8"," 9 of 26 people (35%) found this review helpful","35","9","26","0","0"

The gift would not send at first, but after a few attempts it finnaly sent. I imediatly started the download on the game whilse me and my friend played another game. The download had completed and my friend told me their was a tutorial i had to complete when the game started. Now this is understandable, however the map to the tutorial did not load along some of the backround and my player itself did NOT load. I thought that it was just the tutorial so i simply started a campain level and the same thing happened. I do not know if the game is buged or files were corrupt or anything.

All the great fun from back then, with all the improvements you would also expect for gaming today. Controls are simple and easy to use. You can customise the game maps. You can change pretty much every setting when creating a game.\nThey added different types of worms (Scientist, Heavy and Recon) that adds a lot more flavor and variety when playing.\n\nThe only bad side I found was how repetitive the campaign felt. But for a multiplayer game, that is a minor issue. Overall, a certain buy for anyone that likes to play co-op games.\n","December 16, 2014","true","21.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's crazy and funny and reminds me a lot of Worms Amargedom. The controls answer very well, the weapons viriety is great, the sound is funny and the animations are awesome.\n\nI do not recommend this game for a simple reason: it doesn't support anti-aliasing in AMD graphics card. This reason will not keep me away from this game, I'll surely play a lot more of it and I definitely recommend it if you have a Nvidia card or don't care about horrible aliasing, but I've seen lots of people upset about this and hence, cannot recommend it to everyone. And remember the game uses OpenGL, so, there's no way to use a AA injector (you can still use downsampling though).\n\nGraphics: 4/10 - The lack of AA doesn't allow me to see the game's full potential here.\nSound: 7.9/10  - Although they are not outstanding quality-wise, the dialogue lines are extremely funny as so are the sound effects. The music is a little annoying, but it's a matter of taste.\nGameplay: 10/10 - You can blow worms, make them drown, punch them in the face, burn them, etc, all with flawless gameplay, big weapon variety, destructible environment and guaranteed laughs.\nEnvironment: 9/10 - The environment is completely destructible, there's a nice map selection available and a map editor. The water available is also very useful and well made. The background animations also make the soldiers really look like worms, in previous worms games I always felt like they were giant mutant worms.\n\nFinal result: 7.7/10 - As I stated before I cannot recommend this game to everyone due to the lack of AA in AMD cards. There are lots of people who are really engaged into the "graphics war" and if one of these people buy this game and have an AMD graphics card they'll be nothing short of frustrated. If you have a Nvidia card or just don't care for heavy aliasing this is an awesome title to get.","December 30, 2014","false","11.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No lobbies, 3 gamemodes only, can't play online, 4 forts only done with the textures of the ground, 4 themes only and, worst thing of all, they charged a DLC on day 1 instead of adding new content for the multiplayer.\nWithout offense, but other people plaising this game are people that are fanboys of Team17 and the truth is this game is worth only for the single player. If you want to play the multiplayer, just DON'T buy this game at all. For single player, it's worth a shot when the price is discounted (to be clear, less than 5 euros is ok).\n\nNo wonder why this game resulted in a flop: 1/10 of people that bought worms reloaded on day 1 bought this game too, plus less than 400 people played a match online. You can check the achievement percentages on your own.\n\nHoping to get the old Team17, which seems to be like that in the newest incoming game: Worms Clan Wars.","July 21, 2013","false","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Team 17 doesn't understand that by adding newer features from the game but removing  other features that made up the core experience, they were in fact destroying what worms was. More or less every game after Worms Armageddon has been a let down. I am a fan of developers trying to add innovative elements into their games, but it should never be at the cost of what made the games fun for people in the first place. The most recent tragedy occurs with the removal of team customization because the developers decided that customization should be based off profiles. Since unlike xbox live, there can be multiple profiles active on one computer at once, this means that there can only ever be one customizable team. Lame. Another completely mind blowing error that I have seen many forum users complain about over the last few games has been and continues to be the amount of worms on a team during a match.","October 23, 2012","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Customizable game modes, a map creator, and lots of items.\n\nHowever, this game isn't perfect. For one thing, the platforming is terrible. If you fall and take damage, costing you your turn, half the time the controls are to blame.\n\nThen there's the single player campaign. The AI is the very definition of perfection, and is some of the most unfair AI I've ever seen, and I've played a lot of Mario Kart in my time. You could be on a tiny floating chunk of land just big enough to stand on and an AI worm can throw a grenade from across the map, ricochet it off walls and celings and get it to land perfectly on that worm's head without bouncing off. Not only are they unfair, but as you progress, they start to outnumber you more and more. I've gotten to the point where I've started with only 4 worms and the AI has 10. Unless you're the kind of person who enjoys games like Dark Souls, where the challenge is based on how unfair the AI is, I wouldn't touch the singleplayer with a 10 foot pole.\n\nThat aside though, this game is clearly meant to be played with friends anyways, and it's definitly worth the buy just for the multiplayer.","September 26, 2014","true","25.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It has a terrible control scheme in which, unlike every game ever, spacebar is attack and shift is jump.  The problem is, because they are assigned to multiple commands, when you reset one, it leaves the other commands blank and you have to re-scheme the controls using separate buttons for things like skip dialog, target, and attack, which were previously all assigned to one key.  And as to the skip dialog, you will be wanting to do that because this game has awful writing, unhelpful tutorials that teach you the obvious things in the game while leaving out how to control the actual functions, and the worst voice actor I've ever heard.  Makes my sphincter clench just imagining his voice.\n\nThat's not to mention all the problems with the 3D, either, including hitbox problems, seemingly random friction coefficent (except when the computer is placing perfect shots with grenades from impossible to reach places on the map).  The physics engine they use goes to complete waste, too, because most of the maps it's still more efficient to pound away with regular attacks than to try to use the water or objects strategically.\n\nJust the worst game I've ever spent money on on Steam.  Complete garbage.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  This is not the Worms you know and love.  This is a crappy cheap knockoff.","September 1, 2014","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control worms using over the top weapons to kill other worms.  For example, grenades have a timer and can be bounced to its target, Bazooka can't.  There are some nice single player missions that go from easy to throwing-things-at-the-wall-AI cheating and never misses hard.  The true value of this game is playing with other people.  It's kind of like a board game that way, the board chatter, banter, and trash talk make the game infinitely more enjoyable.  Also like a board game, if you have people to play with and you like the concept, buy it for yourself and get friends to do the same.  Solo play?

It has a terrible control scheme in which, unlike every game ever, spacebar is attack and shift is jump.  The problem is, because they are assigned to multiple commands, when you reset one, it leaves the other commands blank and you have to re-scheme the controls using separate buttons for things like skip dialog, target, and attack, which were previously all assigned to one key.  And as to the skip dialog, you will be wanting to do that because this game has awful writing, unhelpful tutorials that teach you the obvious things in the game while leaving out how to control the actual functions, and the worst voice actor I've ever heard.  Makes my sphincter clench just imagining his voice.\n\nThat's not to mention all the problems with the 3D, either, including hitbox problems, seemingly random friction coefficent (except when the computer is placing perfect shots with grenades from impossible to reach places on the map).  The physics engine they use goes to complete waste, too, because most of the maps it's still more efficient to pound away with regular attacks than to try to use the water or objects strategically.\n\nJust the worst game I've ever spent money on on Steam.  Complete garbage.  Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.  This is not the Worms you know and love.  This is a crappy cheap knockoff.","September 1, 2014","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mechanically, the game plays the same as the originals which is simultaneously a boon (solid controls) and a bust (pressing the wrong button and jumping instead of activating a weapon or vice-versa)\nIf you're new to Worms the intro serves as a decent tutorial to get you into the game although the learning curve is pretty steep when it throws you directly into matches against bots.\nOverall, unless you're a Worms fan it's not a must buy but it's still a good one.","August 27, 2014","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That AI is probably the best in the whole gaming history - 95% of the time, pinpoint precision is what you'll get from 'em (when you are in range), so you really have to have nerves of steel and a ton of patience, in order to get it done. I don't know what difficulty is, because the game is so smart that it won't let you choose some pre-defined difficulty for the campaign, for some reason. Furthermore, the 4th (last) part is quite absurd..Losing about 2 hours to get one mission, pff..some of us don't have that amount of time on our hands.\nIf you want to play this game, just ignore the campaign and do it for the sake of versus mode, maybe..","November 14, 2015","false","25.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Players take turns launching weapons at the opposing team, blowing up Worms and destroying the landscape. There are several new gameplay elements, including physical objects, Worm Classes, great voice acting, that make this an amazing game.\n\nThe classes are one of the newer features and I believe it works and if you don't like it, you can just keep your formation of Worms made up of Soldiers. Worms are separated into Soldier, Heavy, Scientist, and Scout. The Soldier is the basic Worm, well rounded and the default starting Worm. Each of the other three classes has their own drawbacks and benefits. The Heavy Worm is heavy – the jetpack doesn’t last as long and he doesn’t move as fast. He also withstands more damage and deals more damage. The Scout Worm is at the opposite end of the spectrum, quick moving and weak. The Scientist Worm provides each Worm on the team with 5 health points every time his turn comes up. I like this update, it adds new strategies and fun.\n\nThe Single Player missions including both campaign play and puzzles is another area of refinement for the series. The entertaining and often hysterically funny actor, Matt Barry (The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh, and many other film and television credits), is your guide through these well designed missions. The first set of campaign missions includes 8 training missions, to introduce gameplay and the newer features.\n\nThe landscape editor allows you to create your own landscape for play. This tool is very easy to understand, so you can have your first landscape created within minutes.\n\nWorm Revolution includes nicely rendered 2D landscapes on a 3D backdrop with various themes. Choose from three gameplay modes – single player missions with Matt Berry’s voice work, online multiplayer matches, or local versus matches against the computer or your friends.\n\nOverall, this is a great game, whether you are a fan of the series of have never played it before, with simple concepts and fun quick action that can often result in hilarious outcomes. There is tons of replay value. This is one of those games that never gets old and the newer features add to the excitement.","June 28, 2014","true","51.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe Team 17 should get the ♥♥♥♥ing hint that these games shouldn't be sold at outrageous prices of $15-$20 along with dlc ranging from $5-10. That and a more workable multiplayer matchmaking system would be nice along more flexible modding where one can use voices others can hear without having to make them download it. It's a shame to, these games are really fun if you can get people together.\n\nAnyways, game doesn't look all that pretty for a 3D worms. I really enjoy the more vibrant look of Worms Reloaded and Armageddon. The items have also seemed to be lackluster compared to previous titles. I would suggest Armageddon  if anything else over whatever Team 17 keeps attempting to perfecting and missing utterly hard.","November 27, 2015","false","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a beginner at this game then you will get confused about what the f*** everything does and how it works, this means that in matches with other players you will think 'Oh I have a really good opportunity here to do such and such' then you completley and utterly fail to do something due to little quirks in the gameplay that make it a lot less fun. This frustrates me and because of the minimalist tutorial, you don't get a feel for the physics, or what most of the things in the game do.\n\nOn that basis I do not recommend buying this game, though if you are a seasoned veteran of the Worms series by all means, go ahead.
