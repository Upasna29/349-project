As a puzzle game, navigating rooms with a teleporting arrow/beam is pretty unique, relying on position and perspective to navigate small to medium sized environments. There's a gradual difficulty curve, which I personally appreciate; it gives you simpler puzzles to introduce new mechanics or obstacles, then ramps up the difficulty. There also seem to be multiple ways to solve the puzzles, which makes the time trials and leaderboards more meaningful.\n\nThe aesthetic is minimalistic, a lot of flat colors and an overall earthy tone, not strikingly beautiful like the Witness or Journey but fairly unique and pleasant to look at. The music is a bit sparse, it sounds okay the first 30 minutes you hear it but you'll most likely just mute it and listen to your own music or a podcast. That said, there's little to no story, and sound effects aren't important to puzzle solving so this might be right up your alley if you need something to keep your hands busy.\n\nGameplay is simple and the controls are good enough; move with WASD and aim with the mouse, click to fire the arrow into an orb which teleports you to the same position relative to the companion orb. So if you're standing 10 feet to the left of one orb, fire at it, you'll be ten feet to the left of the companion orb. The early levels are static, letting you grasp the mechanics of navigating the stage via relative positioning. Later levels introduce ramps that rotate the stage and moving platforms which add timing to the mix. There's also a simple but genius difficulty toggle in the game, a guide that shows you where your shot will place you. Seeing this makes the game significantly more straight-forward, but you can remove it for added challenge. You can change this option on the fly with a button press, which I think is a perfect balance of accessibility and challenge.\n\nOverall I had a positive experience with the game: very easy to pick up and play, it became challenging over time without getting frustrating or punishing, and there's a decent amount of variety in gameplay mechanics. With a little more variety in music and set dressing, maybe an extra challenge mode or user generated content this could be a solid game with a lot of replayability.","May 14","true","7.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Those shiny globes go in paires - after you hit each of them with a beam it momentarily moves the character in an opposite direction (if one moves up, then another one shifts you down). There's also that gravity rotation mechanics like in 'The Bridge' and 'InBetween', so you can further experiment with the directions, trying to get to an exit. It's all nice and quality made but rather shallow and bland, I would like to see more stuff like story, characters, variations in style to get more interested.\n\nНеплохая платфоменная головоломка, основанная на физике релятивистской телепортации про девочку-мага, вооруженную лучом, которая путешествует по абстрактным архитектурным стуктурам (храмам?), где вместо мебели находятся какие-то сферы квантовой природы. Эти сияющие шары расположены парами - попадая по каждому из них лучом, герой мгновенно перемещается в противоположную сторону (один поднимает, дпугой спускает). Также присутствует механика вращения гравитации как в играх "Мост" и "Промежду", так что можно экспериментировать с направлениями, пытаясь пробраться к выходу. Все это мило и качественно сделано, но мелковато и плоско. Для поддержания интереса хотелось бы увидеть побольше таких вещей как сюжет, герои и различные стили.","May 9","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Teleporting plus changing gravity makes for some interesting puzzles, and the graphics are great. I'm really interested to see where this will go. The only thing that really, really hurts it is the controls. Keyboard and Mouse SIMULTANEOUSLY are your only option. It was too awkward for me to play for very long. The mouse is only used for selecting which portal to use for teleporting. No reason why you couldn't use a 360 controller, with the shoulder pads switching between portals. At least offer it as an option! So for now, 3 out of 5 stars.\n\nDisclaimer: I got this game for free from orlygift in return for agreeing to post an honost review.","April 23","true","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This game could be more interesting if they can add more music and sound.\nI'm looking forward to play the final release.","April 26","true","0.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"
