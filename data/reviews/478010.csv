There's a very poor selection of colour, the bucket fill tool and the free draw tool conflict with each other, so if you're looking to create a mixed media piece, you better be prepared to correct the ugly white border the paint brush leaves behind. My biggest gripe is with the scoring system, it's completely broken. A piece I spent an hour composing only received a "great job" whilst leaving the picture completely empty gave me an "excellent!" In the creative industry that would be met with a lawsuit. Horrible game, I absolutely would not recommend this to anyone.","May 30","false","0.7"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","4","8","3","3"
