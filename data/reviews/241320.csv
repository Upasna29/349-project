Thanks to some ingenius design, the puzzle's difficulty scales with you, but in a very natural way. You can choose to get all the items before completing the game, which will give you more options to solve each situation. But the game is designed that you can beat the game without all the items if you want an extra challenge. And if you, like me, want the extra extra challenge, there's optional puzzles and dungeons that will make you feel dumb for hours while you try everything, before you finally get your EUREKA moment, then you feel like the smartest person in the world.\n\nOn top of the great game design, the charming art and writing is perfect bonus that ties the game all together.\n\nHighly recommended!!","November 25, 2013","true","21.3"," 40 of 46 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","40","46","0","0"

While the delightful art style and fantastic soundtrack both pay homage to the classic series, the similarities in actual gameplay are rather cursory and it turns out that's a good thing.\n\nThe emphasis here is entirely on the puzzles, more specifically, block puzzles. You'll spend nearly your entire stay on the island pushing, freezing, and teleporting blocks and enemies around, flipping switches and ultimately opening a ton of chests and doors on your quest for treasure. As the sole focus of the adventure the quality of the puzzles is paramount, and fortunately they happen to be supremely well designed and satisfying to solve, rarely crossing the line into overly hard nor easy. They provide an entertaining challenge as well as a bit of replayability with several different paths available for completing the game, something that's rarely seen in this genre.\n\nAll of this combined with the clever boss fights, tongue in cheek humor, and outstanding presentation add up to a very short but (technical hiccups aside) immensely enjoyable game from start to finish. Don't make the mistake of taking Ittle Dew at face value, for it has more than enough heart to breakaway from it's inspiration, and should not be missed!","September 2, 2013","true","3.4"," 31 of 35 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","31","35","0","4"

Playing as a blonde in a green tunic with a sword (or stick), stuck on an island with a flying friend and top down gameplay doesn't help make it not look like a Zelda clone. That's the flavor of the game. Is it Zelda? No, but it'll do (Ittle Do). This game is slightly different than a Zelda clone because it is a push block puzzle game with a few enemies and deviations from push block puzzles.\n\nThere are a few items and you start with a stick that you can use to light on fire, then melt ice blocks, set off bombs and so on. Eventually you'll move to a flaming sword to do what a flaming stick can, a magical teleportation wand that allows you to set a block, use the wand and have the enemy or object appear where you set the block. Finally, you'll get an ice wand to freeze enemies, blocks, put out fire and even make walls reflect projectiles like your teleportation staff. You can tell a lot of work went into making the items as not just items to solve puzzles, but combat items as well. You can use the teleporation block to set a block under you, step off and if an enemy is on it, the enemy will fly off screen. You can set a block, push it onto spikes, then use the teleportation wand to teleport the enemy into the block on the spikes, killing them that way. Even though it is disguised as Zelda, I feel like the game could have been made in RPG Maker.\n\nAll of the items and weapons are bound to buttons on the X-Box controller which is nice, you can use everything at once without having to visit a menu. There are no deaths in this game, so much as there are room restarts. When you die, you just reset whatever room you were in with full health. Rooms including sections of the overworld map. There is no consequence, making it a very easy for kids game. Each room has a hint sign or two and if you need even more help, you can hit the left button to have your fluttering fox friend give you a hint. There is even a nice little map too showing you where treasures and doors are (unlocked and locked).\n\nThis is an enjoyable game even if its quick and simple when compared to Zelda. There is a good diverse array of enemies with different ways to take them out. The art style is charming, there is plenty of exploration and a slightly open world go where you want feel. The art style, happy nature, hints and ease of puzzles makes me feel this game is better for kids. Give it a go, its fun for a few brief hours until you complete it in one or two sittings. The game is so brief, there are achievements for beating it under 3 hours and completing it under 15 minutes.\n\nIttle Dew is a good stepping stone for this developer to make a grander Zelda like game.","June 10, 2014","true","10.9"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","0"

It was like a time warp.\n\nAnyways, lets quit the drama and let me present you with a Short, sweet review just like the game.\n\nPros:\n+ Amazing gameplay. It's downright fun.\n+ Cleverly designed puzzles.\n...+ The puzzles are not super hard niether are they super easy.\n...+ It's a perfect mixture of hard yet non-frustating puzzle. Exactly what I look for in a VIDEO GAME.\n+ Short and nice story.

(Each of which grants a different achievement too)\n\nCons:\n- There was only exactly ONE situation where I thought the game/floor/level design could have been better.\n- And that's an extremely low number for a puzzle game. (or any game tbh)\n\nI got this game as a gift from a friend who bought it from humble bundle for $1.00 along with a couple of other games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/241320/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The generally accepted reason for why there aren’t more games like The Legend Of Zelda is that they’re just too hard to make. Ocarina Of Time is still widely accepted as the best game ever made, but that in itself implies that its creation was not a trivial task. There have been attempts to copy the formula, from early titles like Golden Axe Warrior through to Alundra, 3D Dot Game Heroes, and Ōkami, but not only are these efforts rare but they’ve generally been commercial failures.\n\nThat is likely to be the real reason for the lack of similar games, but such market realities are not something that indie developers generally worry about. Which is good because, despite a few caveats, Ittle Dew is one of the most enjoyable Zelda-a-likes we’ve played in years.\n\nDespite what it may look like Ittle Dew is not a straight clone, but it does have perhaps the most legitimate excuse for copying another game: comedy. Ittle Dew isn’t just a love letter to the Zelda games it’s also a parody of them, and its spunky heroine Ittle and her Navi stand-in Tippsie (a wonderfully cynical magic fox) gently poke fun at the series’ specific peculiarities and those of gaming in general.\n\nTippsie in particular is hilarious, as she reacts with varying degrees of disgust to ordinary Zelda tropes, such as Ittle eating a heart to get more health to her quaffing potions when she’s not looking. Joking about smashing pots and what enemies do all day as they stand around in lonely dungeons may seem like obvious targets, but as we’ve often lamented games are strangely reticent to ever poke fun at their sillier traditions.\n\nThe jovial mood is enhanced further by the wonderful visuals, but despite the art style being very different from any official Zelda game overall Ittle Dew still ends up looking lawyer-worryingly similar. The game is scheduled for release on Wii U later in the year though so we assume that Nintendo gets the joke as well.\n\nIttle has a much more mercenary approach to her explorations than Link, happily stuffing her pockets with treasure as she goes about adventuring. Even the artefact she’s trying to obtain from a nearby castle is only to bribe a shopkeeper to build her a ship to get home. Although he does at least offer to sell her three items vital to her mission: a fire sword, an ice wand, and a portal-creating magic wand.\n\nUnusually for a Zelda game these are the only three items in the whole game, which is certainly a bold choice. But despite all the puzzles being solved using only one or more of the items it’s disappointing that the meat of most of them still revolves around pushing blocks and hitting switches. In the traditional manner there are torches and bombs to be lit, pressure pads to stand on, and doors to unlock.\n\nThe puzzles might not be very imaginative but they are well designed and often have multiple solutions. You can even beat the entire game using any random combination of just two of the items. Some of the puzzles are very hard but the game isn’t interested in punishing you, only challenging you, and there’s a wide range of helpful hints given out by Tippsie.\n\nThe dungeon-like areas are very much the focus of the game and although there are overworld areas they’re smaller and less interactive than real Zelda games. The combat is also significantly less interesting, being barely any more nuanced than the original NES game and offering zero reward beyond extra health. The bosses are a mostly decent bunch though and also get some of the best lines.\n\nIttle Dew is rather short, at around three to four hours, although you’ll need much longer to collect everything and beat the optional Master Cave (the only truly difficult challenge in the whole thing). But for only a tenner you get a download that is not only fun but funny – a game that is amusingly self-aware but uses this as a means to enhance the experience and not just make excuses for it.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 27, 2014","true","32.9"," 44 of 67 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","44","67","0","8"

Ittle Dew features an amazing amount of well thought and tricky puzzles. A huge amount of time and love went into crafting and polishing this game.\n\nSide note: Ittle Dew was actually submitted as an idea to Nintendo as a Zelda spinoff, but they turned it down. Which is really too bad for them as this would have fit in with any of the Wind Waker style of Zelda games.\n\nProbably for the best really, a lot of the charm of Ittle Dew comes from the aesthetic as a Zelda parody, from poking fun at the goofy statues to the over the top silly monsters.\n\nReally, the only thing I'd want out of Ittle Dew is a little more content, your first playthrough will top out at 90 to 150 minutes of play. However, there are multiple ways to finish the game, which can lead to a lot of replay value.\n\nBut that said, Ittle Dew is very much worth your time and money if you are a fan of puzzle games.\n\nThanks.","December 1, 2013","true","9.5"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","18","21","0","1"

It's a cute adventure game focused strictly on solving puzzles. You solve one, open the door, move to the next room and so on. The only few rpg elements include things like health upgrades and cash to buy items (3 items that open up more puzzle mechanics).\n\n\nPROS\n- Lovely art style and animation, very fitting.\n- The writing is really fun. Expect lots of snarky comments and quirky dialogues.\n- The base game is challenging enough for casual playthroughs. There's an optional "dungeon" full of super hard puzzles for the aditional challenge\n- 60fps goodness, runs so smooth\n\nCONS\n- All the puzzles in game revolve around box pushing mechanics. Provides a good challenge but could get boring after a while.\n- Lack of exploration\n- I wish the characters had more story or progression, loved all of them.\n- Not much replayability unless you want the achievements, most of which are rerunning the game with some sort of handicap.\n- The game is short (my first blind playthrough was 2:30 hours, got all collectables and completed the extra hard dungeon too)\n\nSUM\nIf you like puzzlers and don't mind lots of box pushing, you'll love it. The humour is great and the game is very pretty to look at. The puzzles can get extremely difficult (even convoluted) and provide a great challenge.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lah5175/recommended/241320/","lah5175","Annavel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lah5175/","379 products in account","I give this game a very cautious recommendation.\n\nI picked it up because I'm a huge Zelda fan, and it was on sale at the time. The gameplay is similar to a 2D Zelda in many regards in that you explore, fight, and solve puzzles using your trusty stick/sword and items that you gain throughout your adventure. So yes, there are a lot of familiar elements here if you like these kinds of games.\n\nThat said, it doesn't PLAY like a Zelda game. That's not necessarily a bad thing depending on why you enjoy these games in the first place. Whereas Zelda has very tight, simple combat and excellent monster design, it becomes apparent soon after starting this game that combat is not the main focus. Ittle's stick has a short range and some enemies do not suffer knockback when hit. There are also not many enemies with unique weaknesses. Most of them are a simple hack n' slash affair.\n\nWhere this game truly shines is in the puzzle department. I would even say that this game is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game, because the world is compact and filled to the brim with puzzles. Many of them are actually challenging! I literally spent hours in the Master Cave, an optional dungeon filled with the toughest puzzles that this game has to offer, because the puzzles were so difficult and I was determined to solve them without a guide. Though I felt like ripping my hair out at the time, solving these complex puzzles was a rewarding experience in and of itself, unlike in Zelda dungeons where it sometimes feels like puzzles are just there to pad the game out.\n\nThis is a short game, and there are only three items (besides the default stick) that you can obtain. The twist is that these items work together to help you solve puzzles and traverse the main dungeon. For instance, you can combine the portal wand and the ice rod to create an ice block that warps you to the other side of the room. This part of the game was handled ingeniously. There are so many things you can do with these three items and the objects in your environment. There are also multiple ways that you can beat the game, and you don't even need all of the items to do it. Pretty cool!\n\nAs mentioned, this game is short. If you skipped the Master Cave, it would likely take you about 3-5 hours on your first attempt. The replay value comes from finding out different ways to beat the game using different combinations of items. The game is also uniformly hilarious and aware of its genre. Even the credit sequence is funny.\n\nTL;DR - This is more of a puzzle game than a 2D adventure game. If you like puzzles, you will probably like it.","April 22","true","17.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/recommended/241320/","Maxmetpt","Maxmetpt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Maxmetpt/","704 products in account","Ittle Dew is a little game that stands somewhere between Zelda and Sokoban, with a very humorous tone, and featuring friendly game design, with aspects that can be appreciated by pretty much everyone.\n\nFrom casual playthroughs, so rock-hard puzzles and 15 minutes speedruns... it's got it all! It's weird, but it's very nice to see how almost every aspect of this game seems to just fit it and provide a great experience, despite its apparent simplicity!\n\nPresentation\nUndoubtedly, one of its strongest aspects, especially at first. The cartoon-y artstyle is very well done, with a pleasant color scheme, very clean, with added lighting effects modernising its look, somewhat. The highlight here for me, though, is the character design. Everyone looks unique, is a clumsy and silly way, and with their own backstory to support them. It's pretty good!\nAnother detail I liked is how every line moves slightly, making everything seem more alive.\n\nThe music and sound-effects didn't standout out too much for me, but fit nicely with the rest of the presentation, and it wasn't bad by any means! Just didn't seem to carry the experience, for me.\n\nI also found the writting to be funny at times, and it just gave the game a very light-hearted and self-aware tone the whole way through. Ranging from the dialogues with your health-potion drunk companion, to the enemies' entrances and the mocking signposts spread around, everything had something to make fun of.\n\n\nHow's the game structured?\nVery much like a Zelda game, actually. You have an island to explore, and go through several dungeons to beat it. There is also some exploration done outside the main and tutorial dungeons.\n\nNear the beginning of the game, you'll find a shop. The shopkeeper tells you he can give you a raft to escape the island, if you get him the artifact in the castle. And off you go. He also has 3 items to sell. You'll find the gold for it in the castle. The game's puzzles revolve around these 3 items: you'll have to combine their abilities in very varied ways to solve the puzzles.\n\nThe castle has many shortcuts, that you can take by solving much harder puzzles. If you're stuck, you may as well try another way, or go buy another item. There are many different ways of making progress, too!\nThe castle puzzles are pretty straighforward, though, so anyone can safely play it without fearing getting frustrated.\n\nOutside the castle, though, there are other smaller dungeon, with harder puzzles. These usually contain Cards with the game's characters. These are merely collectibles, but they're pretty charming too. The puzzles there can also hint at some mechanics you may have not learned throw the tutorial puzzles.\n\nAs a segue, when you have enough gold, you can take one of several portals spread around the castle to fast travel. When you buy an item, you'll be catapulted into another part of the island. These are the tutorial areas. Your items are all stored near the shop, and you'll have to beat the dungeon only with your newfound item. With this, you'll learn how the item works well enough, and do that through play! I think it's a nice way of doing it.\n\nThese dungeons also contain several paths and shortcuts. One important thing is that you'll never be able to leave the cave while missing important items. When you leave the dungeon, it will be sealed, but you can rest assured that you haven't missed anything important. This is also told to you after your first dungeon, in a sign post.\nThe placing of that was very elegant: since there are multiple paths, it's very likely that you'll miss part of the map, and become worried after leaving the dungeon. Right when you're worrying about it, the signpost clarifies it for you.\nThere are many places like this in the game, making tutorialisation nicely paced. Information is often delivered at the right moment!\n\nI think that about covers it.\n\nGeneral Mechanics\nThis game has both combat and puzzles, although the focus is mainly on the puzzles. There are also some Boss Fights, most of which are more puzzle-driven than combat, although both blend rather nicely, items being multi-purposed.\n\nThe combat is very straightforward. Your basic attack attacks the tile in front of you. There are also projectiles attacks. There are several different enemies, some that attack only in front of them, some have projectiles, etc. Different enemies require different approaches. Also, they'll respawn each time you enter the room, but it's never a problem as they're easy to avoid. Some puzzles also reset, but only when the initial conditions are necessary for you to solve another puzzle in the room (or perhaps to use a shortcut).\n\nThe only problem I've had with the combat, is how the movement is a bit floaty, and there's a lack of knock-back with some enemies. The enemies often drop hearts to replenish your health, and the game is overall not punishing in the least, so it's not too big of an issue.\n\nLack of Punishment\nThat's mostly a good thing, but it sometimes holds the player's hand too much. For example, Boss fights have 3-5 phases, and there's usually a checkpoint between each. I've found that mostly unnecessary, taking the little challenge that they provided. I think boss fights should still be a threat!\nOn the other hand, each time you die, you'll simply reset the room, but never lose progress, or collectibles at all. That's a very welcome thing! It's always annoying to do 4-5 rooms again when you die, or lose progress over a simple miss-step.\n\n\nThe puzzles are basically Sokoban, with a few twists. You have 3 items: a Flaming Sword, a Freezing Wand, and a Teleporting Wand.\nThe sword can set bombs on fire, to explode after a few seconds. The Freezing Wand can freeze enemies and blocks (making them very slippery when you push them, and also breakable), and can also freeze a wall, making it reflective.\nThe Teleporting Wand can create a Green block anywhere. If you hit bombs or enemies with the projectile, they'll teleport over to that block. This is basically all you need to know.\nYou combine these techniques with some more subtle quirks to the tiles and timing, and you can be faced with some evil difficult puzzles.\n\n\nDifficulty.\nIttle Dew sets its casual from its hardcore puzzles\nUsually, to beat the game, you have some fairly easy puzzles. To collect the cards, it's a different matter (although mostly doable). There's a final dungeon with 12 puzzles however, that is really hard! At least for someone inexperienced in Sokoban. I often had to peek into a walkthrough, and was constantly surprised with a new way of combining my items.\n\nPrecision and Perfection rather than simply solving a puzzle\nThe problem is that some of these puzzles required extremely precise timing, with the game's controls don't provide very well, in my opinion. Also, these puzzles constantly made you restart at every wrong move. A time rewinding mechanic would be welcome, even if just on this cave. I had to restart these puzzles many times, making it a bit too frustrating. It wasn't just a puzzle to solve, it was something that heavily relied on execution, which I'm not a fan of.\n\nThen again, these were completely optional! And the game warned you that they were hard. If you complete it, you'll get some more cards, and also Development info, which is very cool!\n\nH.Mention: The castle can be solved with ANY combination of 2 items. I'm very impressed with this! The castle is so nicely designed that you can beat it with any combination of the two items, and the game aknowledges that with achievements. Also for cards, speed, etc.\nThere are many ways of playing Ittle Dew, which is why I think it's a neatly designed game. Many ways that tie together brilliantly!\nFull Recommendation. Also, check Card City Nights!","January 11, 2015","true","7.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The makers said the game is designed in a way to allow speed running and it shows, with best times going as low as 10 minutes. This allows many modes of play, adding variety to playthroughs. The items you recieve can be gotten in any order, and you don't even need all of them to complete the story, although catching them all surely helps solving some puzzles. The bosses aren't really given much backstory, as any other character really, but this may have been necessary, seeing as having loads of story in a game this short would detract from the gameplay. However, tidbits of information are scattered throughout the game and reading them adds some depth to the world of Ittle Dew. Some of the harder puzzles can be a little tricky to solve since the game doesn't tell you a couple of abilities one of your items has, nothing that a little thinking wouldn't solve, but seeing each new skill having a small tutorial, one could get a slightly confused. Ittle Dew is an adorable little game that really shows the developers put a lot of care in making it as fun and endearing as possible, while maintaing its unique humour.","June 23, 2014","true","11.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

You go through dungeons mostly solving puzzles, but there is a combat element to the game also. The combat is pretty basic, but you can freeze and teleport enemies in addition to slashing them with your sword. The puzzles are nicely balanced. Nothing was too hard to feel like giving up on and nothing was too easy to get bored on. The only thing I didn't like was the optional Master Cave dungeon. You basically needed a walkthrough to get through most of these. The solution to a lot of the puzzles require doing things that you never did during the main game, but are expected to know about somehow in this dungeon. A few of the puzzles also require fast reflexes instead of just puzzle solving like the rest of the game. It just all felt out of place to me. Overall though, the game was very enjoyable and I would recommend to anyone that likes the puzzle solving in something like The Legend of Zelda games. You can do mostly everything (minus the achievements) in about 7 hours, depending on how quickly you can figure out the puzzles.","January 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

In these games you always played an hero off to find adventure, find treasure and save the world (usually in that order but reverse priority).   To do so, you usually had to solve puzzles and fight plent of bad guys.\n\nEnter Ittle Dew, keen on adventure and treasure, but not so much the saving the world stuff, she is finds herself stranded on an Island, with the only chance of leaving involving getting (i.e. stealing) an artifact from a castle for the shopkeeper.\n\nAlong the way you must get (i.e. once again steal) at least two of three magic weapons with the help of the same shopkeeper (who gladly takes your cash for the favor) to solve the puzzles of the castle and surrounding area.\n\nThis is a great game that doesn't take itself seriously, but is great for serious players.   You can speed run or play for completion.  There are shortcuts for those willing to do more challanging puzzles, and even alternative ways to solve the puzzles, all while Ittle's sarcastic attitude, her potion-holic assistant "tippsy" and a cast of quite insane villians keep you amused.\n\nIf you expect your games to be serious and realistic, maybe you should look elsewhere, but if you like difficult puzzles and timeless classic-style gameplay, all wrapped up into a tribute to the adventure games of old, then this is definately the game for you.","June 10, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

(The Schmaltzy Cynic)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brian_Colfxire/","468 products in account","With the sequel confirmed and on the way, getting into Ittle Dew now is the perfect time. I had always meant to play this game but only now did I ever give it the chance.\n\nMaybe it was the Adventure Time style and humor that put me off, leading me to believe this game would be a nonsensical game without any logic. It is nosensical, in a good way, but the puzzles and gameplay are finely crafted with various solutions in an otherwise illogical adventure.\n\nWake up, Adventurer.\nThe story for Ittle Dew is simple: Beat things up and solve puzzles. And then you have weirdo, meta characters and conversations that take slight jabs at the game itself. The interactions with Tippsie (the flying fox) and Ittle are my favorite bits in the game, mostly because of how cynical and arrogant Tippsie comes off.\n\nIf you do like the wierdness humor of Adventure Time or Regular Show, then you'll probably find the other characters entertaining. I had one or two laughs as I liked the small world of the game, but I didn't find anything too interesting or memorable.\n\nWhat Can You Dew?\nWhere the story and the characters were lacking, the puzzle/adventuring aspects of the game were what sold me on the game itself. And not on my first playthrough but my third one as well.\n\nYou are given a stick to start with that can temporarily be set on fire. You later can get a Flame Scimitar (like the stick but stronger and always on fire), the Portal Wand that can create blocks and teleport things, and a Freeze Wand. Some items have some synnergy between them that becomes useful when solving a room when you only have two items.\n\nIn order to beat the game, you only require two out of three items; however, on your first playthrough, you will want to collect all three items to 100% the game. Not only would you want to do this for achievements, but after each item-boss, there are extra dungeons that teach you more in-game mechanics through smaller, harder puzzles.\n\nThe only reward  worth caring about is the heart-notes for extra lives; the cards are added in for flavor, but it's the practice of familiarizing yourself with the mechanics and experimenting with your tools are the real rewards for the challenge. They're all centered on the item you bought and they're all completely optional, so the puzzles are a great method of teaching the player how to play the game better.\n\nOnce you have all three items, and you think you're smart enough, you can then tackle the Master Cave. You might think these challenges begin fairly simple (for the first four or five rooms), but the later challenges will test your reflexes as much as your puzzle-solving skills, sometimes in really convuluted ways.\n\nI'll admit I had to use a guide because some solutions were so specific to the millisecond I wouldn't be able to figure it out on my own. Although the payoff for completing the twelve hardest puzzles of the game is anticlimatic (as well as the boss-fight), this part of the game will teach you skills you were not even aware of you had all the time with a given tool (or combination of the two).\n\nA complete playthrough, on a (mostly) blind run, will take you about four to seven in-game hours depending on how stubborn you are to avoid a guide. The real fun of the game comes on your next three playthroughs.\n\nA Task Against Familiarity\nAs mentioned before, the game is designed for you to complete the game with two out of three items. Backtracking for the items is less tedious as you'll most likely be able to solve the professional shortcuts after the Master Cave. Navigating through the Castle with a limited amount of items is the real challenge.\n\nThe game forces you to tackle certain rooms for enough loot for what you need while also figuring out how to reach the final boss-room. The final boss fight is tailored to whatever items you have, although the fight is much shorter as a result.\n\nUnfortunately, as a result of not having enough items to do everything, your playthrough from 4 to six hours goes down to less than fifteen minutes to three hours at most as a result of handicaping yourself.\n\nThese shorter runs are still worthwhile because the game takes previous challenges and does a new spin on them, and some rooms are probably impossible (but you wont' know until you try), so these playthroughs are not worthless.\n\nI just wish there was some way to still 100% ALL rooms with these limitations. No run will match the first one in length or for completion, and they freel tailored for speedrunners alone. (I'm not a fan of speedrunning my games; I prefer to take my time and relax).\n\n"Eh, 3 out of 5 at best."\nThis isn't my score of the game, but I think that line quite sums up my thoughts. The game has great potential to expand upon, but the shortcomings on the more interesting playthroughs make me hopeful for more polish from a game that is already nicely polished.","September 18, 2015","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Basically, it's like a 2D Legend of Zelda game with a heavy focus on the puzzles. You're washed up on a mysterious island and, as any good adventurer does, you start to adventure. It's pretty straightforward in terms of adventuring. You go from dungeon to dungeon as they become available to you, work on puzzles with the dungeons in order to complete them, and then receive items to help you progress further. Upon getting an item, you generally are sent to a new area without the other items, forcing you to get acquainted with the new item and its uses before being able to combine the uses of all your items. There are a few optional shortcuts and slightly hidden puzzles you can go after, which is nice for even more puzzle solving. It is also entire possible to complete the game without getting all of the items. You can beat it with a few combinations of a few items. These are reflected in the achivements, but... I'll be honest, I had enough trouble with the main game using everything. There's also some funny little dialogues going on in parts of the game which give it some life and keep things from getting too harsh on your brain. Almost like little rewards for continuing. And there are boss fights which will give some action to your problem solving skills. A nice blend for the game.\n\nThere are a few downsides though, as all games have. One is that the game is rather short. Most of the playtime here will be from getting stuck on tricky puzzles. There's not much adventuring, as most of the places you go to are rather straightforward and without missable secrets. Even the optional puzzles are pretty easy to find. So I guess there could've been more adventure for my taste. Also, the combat is a little rough. It just feels a bit stiff and non responsive. There's less focus on it, but still, a little more fluidity might have been nice. Not a big deal, though. You can adjust. There were some pretty interesting puzzles, some involving good timing, but the game doesn't do a great job of teaching you the timing based techniques used later in the game. Also, there's an awful lot of block puzzles, so... if you don't like those... stay away.\n\nOverall, it's a pretty cool game. Is it worth the ten dollar price tag? Well, if you're a Zelda fan or a puzzle fan, yes. It's definitely worth checking out. For others? Possibly wait for a sale, or just give it a shot. It's a decent price for what you get. It has some neat sound and a fun art style. The music went well the the mood. It's definitely something anyone could enjoy, but recommended for only the Zelda fans or puzzle crowd, I'd say. If you're looking for more adventure, it may not be your cup of tea. And I must say that, even though it is a bit on the short side, it doesn't FEEL short. It feels like a full game, and that's where it counts. I'd give Ittle Dew 7/10. Good, solid game, but geared more towards the puzzle minded for sure.","January 7, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It took me less than 3 hours to finish it and get a majority of cards and other things, and I’ve spent over an hour after that finishing the collection. Haven’t decided if I should take the rest of the achievements yet or not, could be a fun challenge though. All in all I’ve spent about 5 hours on it and there’s still things for me to do, but mostly in the interest of completing the game without all weapons unlocked or speedrunning.\n\nI have to say that its quite funny written, the characters and how they behave make fun of retro concepts, like eating hearts that fall on the ground. It doesn’t take itself very serious, which fits nicely into everything else.\n\nSo, gameplay! You solve puzzles by either hitting things, putting things on plates or killing things. Basically, if you have no items, you are limited to pushing blocks and finding fireplaces to light your stick on fire. But if you have a firesword you don’t need to find fireplaces, and if you have the icestaff and the firesword you can freeze blocks and then shatter them with your firesword. If you have the portal wand, you can solve even more puzzles, etc. Not only that, you can combine most of the tools in very, very interesting ways that wasn’t expected at all by me.\n\nThis works very well and the puzzles range from crazy obvious to "bweh?” making you feel very stupid when you don’t get them, and extremely clever when you finally do. In many cases you can leave it for later.\n\nEvery dungeon have a boss and they are ok most of the time. Personally I really disliked the last boss and the boss in the master dungeon (which were the only place where I eventually looked for help in solving the rooms). The last boss being annoying and the master dungeon boss being both hard and showing a lot of gameplay fallacies I dislike in 2D top-down games. Still the game is about solving puzzles first and the bosses come as a break that can be quite welcome.\n\nIt’s super pretty and animated in a way that completely fits the style. It very simply borrows a lot from Zelda games in how the graphics look, but have its own way of drawing it, which makes it more of a homage.\n\nAnyway, if you like puzzle games and solving rooms zelda-style, get it!\nIf you want something more action-heavy, then you should probably look elsewhere.\n\nHave a good day! :)","August 5, 2013","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Its on here and the Wii U eshop for$9.99. Its hella nice. Yeah go get it. Unless you don't like any of those, then keep moving and ignore this review.\n\nAlright, I'll actually talk about the game. So you're an adventurer named Ittle Dew and her sidekick Tippsie are on a raft when they bump into a rock and crash on the shore of an island. After going through a short tutorial cave, there's a big castle you come across filled with weird inhabitants who wear suits and tend to be wacky. Outside the castle is Itan, who runs a shop. You can find treasure chests in the castle with coins and you use those to go towards getting items from the shop. Well, you pay Itan and he launches you to a dungeon that the item is at (a fire sword in a fire cave/volcano, an ice wand in an ice cave/dungeon, and a portal wand in the woods). Each dungeon contains a shortcut that can help you get to the boss faster (most likely than not you're gonna use these if you're speedrunning but they do help you finish the dungeons faster supposing you can figure out the puzzle for each shortcut). Depending on the combination of the items you collect (you need at least 2 to get through the castle to the final boss), you can take different routes through the castle to get to the end.\n\nAside from the items I previously mentioned, there are also collectible cards you can find in chests throughout the game that have a picture of a character or enemy in the game along with info on them (they go towards an achievement) and you can find scraps of paper in chests as well that go towards increasing your heart count (4 pieces make a new heart a la Legend of Zelda heart containers, this is also for an achievement if you find them all).\n\nThis game will test you and your thinking skills. Sometimes puzzles are simple like press all the switches or kill all the enemies or hit switches. Other times, you might take a while to solve a puzzle only to be stumped by the next one. Two optional bonus dungeons (The Master Cave and, as of October 31, 2013, the Compost Crypt) contain even tougher brain scratchers and while not necessary or important to the plot (I did say optional, after all), you do get an achievement, one per dungeon upon completing them and there's cards in the Master Dungeon so you'd have to complete it if you were gunning for all the cards. Think of them as advanced puzzles, more or less.\n\nLastly, the dialouge is quite humorous. All the characters have a self-aware feel to them when they speak, like they know they're in a video game. There's even call backs/shout outs to older 2D Zelda games like A Link to the Past or Zelda 1. It knows what its doing and you just go with it cause why not. Even the art style is appealing to the eyes.\n\nI've probably harped on long enough but maybe this will convince you to at least check out Ittle Dew. Look, if you like the old school 2D Zelda games or know someone that does, then this game might be for you/them. Hopefully I've said more than enough to peak your interest B^)","July 2, 2014","true","6.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The tools are very different from what you'll find in Zelda games, though, and there's a lot of focus on having them interact with each other - one puzzle may have you freeze a block to let it slide across that spike wall and then freeze and teleport a bomb so its detonation syncs with you lighting a brazier.\n\nBe aware that it doesn't take long to finish the game, but its replay value is high because the path through the castle is nonlinear, there's a lot of optional treasure/puzzles, and extra-hard shortcuts encourage challenge and speedruns. The limited game length also means that a lot of effort could go into each individual room - nothing feels rushed, and the puzzles use available game mechanics to their fullest potential.\n\nIttle Dew's strongest point of the game is the irreverent yet cute, self-aware humour. Quirky enemy design, expressive hand-drawn graphics and the music support the atmosphere very well.\n\nCombat is rather basic and more about approaching strategically or outsmarting enemies than about the actual process of beating them up, but still a nice diversion between puzzles.\n\nIf you care about silly dialogue, clever puzzles and exploring different routes through the same dungeon, this is for you. If you like long, linear games with a focus on combat and are a dialogue-skipper or prefer serious storylines, you're looking in the wrong place though.","July 12, 2014","true","22.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Don't let the screenshots or heavily inspired Link to the Past aesthetic fool you though, Ittle Dew is about 98% block puzzles and 2% other stuff.  Do not go into this expecting an action-rpg or some kind of dungeon romp with the occasional puzzle.  It's all puzzles and your enjoyment of them will make or break the game for you.\n\nThere are three items used in puzzles: fire sword, ice wand and portal blocks/teleportation.  This isn't anywhere as limiting as it may seem and the game's puzzle design is very tight and well-done.  Ittle Dew gets a lot of mileage with the different ways it incorporates using the tools together to solve puzzles.  I didn't realize until after I finished it that you can beat the game by only collecting two of the three items and with any combination of the two.   It adds a ton of replay value for future playthroughs.  The game also has "shortcut paths", basically hard puzzles that you can use to skip chunks of the game and beat it in less than twenty minutes if you know what to do.  Stuff like beating the game with different combos of items and the shortcut puzzles are cool mechanics/design decisions and I like to seeing them even if I don't necessary plan on ever using them myself.\n\nThe cartoony art is very nice and vivid.  The UI is simple and efficient.  You don't have to walk out of a room to reset a failed puzzle, you can just hit start and hit reset room to save yourself the needless back and forth you'd find in similar games.  The game lets you know how many items are in each area and most collectible item rooms will let you know if you have the correct item to solve the puzzle so you don't spend time beating your head against the wall trying to solve a puzzle you don't have the right item for.  There's just a lot of little things the game does to make playing it a non-aggravating experience.\n\nIn short, if you're down with games that heavily involve pushing blocks and solving puzzles, you'll probably have a solid time with Ittle Dew.  Just don't head into it expecting a Zelda-ish game.","November 6, 2014","true","6.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Think of it as parody on A Link to the Past, but way more focused on puzzles. So if you like puzzles, exploration and RPG-like games, this is for you.\n\nLet me get it over with now: I loved the graphics and I also think the music and SFX fit really in the game. Yes, it's simple, but it helps constructing the game's atmosphere.\n\nOn to pros and cons!\n\nPros:\n* Game plays nice and puzzles are great and well thought-out\n* Funny dialogs\n* Likeable characters\n* Considerable replayability -- you have basically 3 weapons/tools available. You need two of them, it doesn't matter which. Each pair takes you through a different route. You can also get all 3 if you like. So that's at least four major ways to play the game and I've really enjoyed taking each path.\n\nCons:\n* A bit short (but you can replay it and it'll still be fun--see above)\n* Some issues with save files being deleted temporarily (or definitively, as I've read, but it didn't happen to me)\n* If you're using a controller, it may be weirdly configured and there's no way to reconfigure them. Big picture settings were overriden by the game for me. But I got used to it, no big issue.\n* If you're using a keyboard, I've read they just forgot to explain which key does which. I've found the clues on the forums, though. But kind of lame.\n* The weapons are too short and the hit area is very weird. Sometimes you're sure something is gonna hit something (either you, the enemy, projectiles, the first hitting the other one or vice versa), but it doesn't, and the opposite also happens a lot.\n* The game froze twice while I was playing and I know it happened to a lot of people. It auto-saves on (almost) every room, so you should be fine.\n* There's an optional boss that's ridicilously out of place. It's annoying to have such an action boss in a game that's so much about puzzles. I can't stress how frustrating it was.\n\nAnyway, the game is great! If you're into RPGs focused on puzzles, don't think twice--get it!","June 27, 2014","true","11.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This is everything that there is to love about independent game design wrapped in a convenent package, featuring familiar but creative gameplay and a big, non-linear environment to play in. The whole thing feels a little like a parody of Beyond Oasis or Link's Awakening, but even beyond that there's a charming little story going on.\nIf you aren't the kind of person who likes to play a game more than once, this might put you out a little; to get the full experience, the game needs to be completed four different times. Many of the puzzles have several different solutions, and the game is carefully designed to keep the player from ever getting permanently stuck. The sole design flaw is the handling - Ittle can run at angles but can only swing weapons along straight lines, thus fighting is hectic and clunky in some areas.\nMany of my favorite moments involve Ittle and Tipsie's reactions to their environment; encountering enemies for the first time triggers a short dialogue, nearly all of which are extremely funny. Ittle Dew is worth playing through for it's wholesome comedic over tone alone, and once the appealing gameplay is mixed in, the result is an incredibly fun little romp.","September 8, 2014","true","14.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wazat/recommended/241320/","wazat","Wazat1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wazat/","582 products in account","This is an unreasonably good game.  I do list a few nitpicks below, but they don't wreck the game.\n\nPros\nFirst, the positive: This game is cleverly designed, adorable, and a lot of fun.  I enjoyed playing it, and I hope to see a sequel someday.  The puzzles were very well-presented, giving you opportunities to learn the tools before being thrown into a terrifying challenge.  You're always ready, but the puzzles always stretch you and I, for one, walked away feeling satisfied with my accomplishments.\n\nThere are only 3 tools, and yet... the ways they're used are magnificent.  You don't have a bag of gimmicky gadgets to fumble through; instead each puzzle uses one, two or three tools in really clever ways, and I often felt brilliant when I completed them.\n\nThe main game can be defeated when you have all three tools... but you don't need all three.  You can also beat the game with any combination of only two tools, which just warps my mind.  The puzzles felt so tight and so tough, and I was amazed to discover I could complete them with even less.  There's also various side dungeons where you can pick up more health, or collect optional cards.  The real reward is the feeling of victory and the wild ego boost that comes with completing them all by yourself, simply for fun.\n\nFor a really steep challenge, there's also an optional master dungeon that requires all three tools and some really clever thinking.  I strongly recommend it.\n\nThe characters and story are adorable and funny.  I liked them.  The animations are excellent, and I loved the look and feel of Ittle's world.  I also liked Ittle herself... she's charming, if devious.  Her little flying helper is also fun.  They do a good job of making fun of their genre, while adding a lot of their own character as well (which is more important than the parody, and done well).\n\nCons:\nA few minor niggles include:\n-A bit of unclarity in hitboxes and figuring out whether an attack will hit.  It's not a huge deal, since combat is secondary to the puzzles and even this issue doesn't make the combat unfun at all.\n-On a couple occasions, the master dungeon pulled some unwarranted tricks, like requiring incredibly fast movement (down to the millisecond) to be in position in time to act or stop a block, which felt like a deviation from the formula that makes the game good (clever puzzle solving, not brutal platforming skill)\n\nBut the major issue?\n\nI was intensely offended by the optional side-boss fight.  Instead of having you employ all the great tricks you've learned just to reach him, he throws ALL of that away... he is instead just a standard run & stab boss battle, and a brutally unfair one at that (I eventually gave up).  Only your sword matters; you will not use the other tools at all (trying will get you killed repeatedly).  The best strategies I've read for beating him were simply to have lots of health and be fast.  It requires incredibly tight controls, which this game doesn't have, so a lot of it is luck and cheesing bugs and quirks in the AI and movement.  This was not a good climax to the otherwise brilliantly designed master dungeon; instead it was a malicious slap in the face, and god it hurt.\n\nIt still leaves me a bit grumpy, even after all these months.  >:(\n\nBut does this ruin the game?  NO!  It felt anti-climactic and I did feel betrayed and put upon by the developers, but the rest of the game is so good, that this just fades into background noise in comparison.\n\nSummary\n9/10.  This is a fantastic game.  Yes, I'm still intensely bitter about the optional boss (RAAAAGE!!!!), but that doesn't destroy the pure, unfiltered joy that is the rest of this game.  Everything in the main game and optional dungeons, save for that side boss, is excellent.  I still look back with extreme fondness!  I'm looking forward to playing the free Halloween update soon, which was a really cool thing for them to add.","October 14, 2014","true","13.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Each room will have you either killing all enemies in the room, or pushing blocks to press switches in order to open the next room. This wears thin, and even though each item dungeon has a gimmick revolving around the new item, the premise is the same.\n\nSide-content is limited to heart pieces and collectable cards, so there is not too much incentive to pursue these, as taking damage is rare.","March 17","false","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No, this is not a Zelda-like RPG. And, no, it does not try to be a Zelda-like RPG. Putting the graphics aside, this is it's own unique game.\n\nThe puzzles are worth the price of admission alone. They consist of pushing blocks, planting bombs, and and using your unique items to help you progress. Some of these puzzles can be quite challenging. One of the really clever things about this game is that some puzzles can be completed in different ways by using a different combination of your items. It makes for a lot of "ah ha" moments. There is also a real satisfaction in walking into a room that may seem utterly impossible only to discover the solution after reasoning things out.\n\nThere are enemies to fight, akin to Zelda, but they serve more to enhance the puzzle mechanic rather than offer an action spin. With that said, it does mix things up in the puzzle department and there are collectables that can be picked up for your efforts.\n\nThe only gripe i have with the game is that it is painfully short. It can be completed in a matter of minutes for more intelligent gamers out there; there is even an achievement for it. The average gamer will be able to experience most of what the game has to offer in two to three hours. The game does offer extras in terms of collectables that can be sought for completionists and a end game dungeon to really challenge your puzzle solving acumen. This can extend the game time some but over all it does leave you wanting more.","July 24, 2013","true","10.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Anyway, Zelda lands on an island. I think its Germany because the enemies turn into confetti and candy when you kill them. Anyway, his fairy has become a flying dog that drinks all his red potions. Zelda also has boobs now (they're very small. Shh!) and I think he came to the island to find his hat because its missing.\n\nThis is the weirdest Zelda yet because Zelda never finds any rupees and all the enemies are From Where the Wild Things Are and they all have the same name.\n\nI am now going to spoil the entire game for you...\n\nThe enemies are all named Jenny Rich because its a play on the word generic.\n\ngood Zelda game would buy again.","December 28, 2014","true","7.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","3","8","5","0"

Definitely worth it if you like puzzle/adventure games in the vein of old NES/SNES-era titles.  Actually, it's still worth a buy even if you're not into those things.  It's a pretty good game.

It has a strong focus on puzzles which you solve by pushing blocks onto switches and killing enemies. The game in general is somewhat reminiscent of Zelda. The puzzles are challenging but not enough to be frustrating. The game is pretty short and took me about 3 hours to finish, including a tiny bit of sidetracking. It took around an extra 2 to actually complete every puzzle/area.\n\nI do have some problems with the game however, the boss fights felt out of place and I didn't enjoy them. I was also frustrated with the controls, the game uses the arrow keys as well as A,S,Z,X which in my opinion was an extremely awkward choice of keys, I frequently confused each of the keys despite playing the game for hours.\n\nFInally, while I enjoyed the solving the puzzles required to beat the main game, I found some of the outside puzzles very annoying to solve, there are a lot of things that the game doesn't explain to you, like the fact that you can bounce portals and ice off of frozen walls, things like this end up being part of how you are meant to solve the puzzles so if you don't know about these things these kind of puzzles can be very difficult to complete.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and the main story has just the right difficulty level for people who people who are decent at puzzle games. The puzzles outside the main story like those in the Master Cave or Compost Crypt seem to be more for seasoned puzzle solvers.\nIt's a nice game but I feel that for its short length, it'd be more accurately priced at $5.","June 7, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It also comes packed with a sense of humor and plenty of optional puzzles should the main story not satisfy your thirst for solving. The game also encourages multiple runs and has achievements encouraging different styles of play.\n\nYou can expect to wield four different tools that interact with each other different and have special properties waiting to be used. One of my favorite moments in Ittle Dew was the time I discovered how to launch enemies into the heavens by accident. These tools also add variety to the combat with their different applications.\n\nThe combat seems okay for the most part. A certain few enemy types are not easily dispatched which can be annoying if you're stuck in a room with four of them. For some reason, there's some awkwardness when using the stick/sword for fighting. I tend to bump into enemies a lot before striking, but the game is forgiving with death (and failed puzzles) and only resets the room.\n\nThe art design is clean and cutesy. I do enjoy how the trees are very animated. The colors are well chosen. I have no complaints here.\n\nIttle Dew will provide quite a bit of entertainment depending on your skill level with its puzzles. You'll probably have a good time and if you're stuck, call on Tippsie or refer to a guide if even Tippsie can't help you. I highly recommend collecting the in-game card collectibles as you play. They're quite funny.","December 6, 2014","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is, however, more of a parody than a true zelda-esque title, and the game isn't terribly afraid of showing it.  It's humorous, cute, and brings its own spice to the genre.  Its puzzles can be incredibly challenging and rather unforgiving at times, but the reward is... usually pretty good.  Definitely worth it if you like puzzle/adventure games in the vein of old NES/SNES-era titles.  Actually, it's still worth a buy even if you're not into those things.  It's a pretty good game.  I don't understand why it got such a low Metacritic score.\nOne problem I had with it: If you screw up a puzzle, you have to leave the room.  This can get very frustrating, very fast.

I expected something at least decent but what I got was a great and clever puzzle game with high replayability and amusing dialogue/parody.\n\nThe core puzzle gameplay is based around sliding block puzzles, yes, but with interesting mechanics I've not seen done before, especially not all together in the way this game does. Every puzzle feels unique and fresh, and they range from the simple to the mind-numbingly difficult (though I admit that I looked up solutions to a few in the master cave... the harder ones there are also kind of the weakest, lots of secret mechanic stuff you need to know :s )\n\nOn top of that, there are four different ways to complete the game. You can get all three items or any combination of the two, and the paths you can take through the castle are quite different for each 2-combination. I quite enjoyed working out the different ways to make it through to the end, it kept replays fresh and interesting. The achievement set is also pretty great; a few bonus dungeons, 100% collection, and an added challenge to one of the routes for beating the game without harming a few specific enemy types (only possible via one of the four routes, sadly, and there's a bit of a ♥♥♥♥ move possible right after the final boss if you don't set up the castle properly... but ehh!)\n\nThe writing is also amusing, toying with lots of RPG tropes (especially Zelda tropes, which is this game's closest comparison to begin with) but not going overboard. It's very self-aware but clearly the devs loved the kinds of games they're mocking.\n\nThe one weakness of the game is the combat, which is very bare-bones and kind of picky; weapon seems to be a bit shorter than it appears on your character, most notably. It's not a big enough flaw to really detract from the overall experience, though.\n\nThe main game will probably only run you 3-4 hours by itself, including all the extras, but replaying is worth it even if you're not achievement hunting since it does change the game quite a good bit. I think the price is fair, although I did admittedly get this game via Humble. But in the end I'm quite pleased with this silly little game, it's quite a good time.","February 1, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice.\n\nPros\n\nThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.\n\nThe Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.\n\nThe Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.\n\nCons\n\nThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.\n\nThe Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.\n\nThe Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the "cost-per-hour" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.\n\nAt the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it. Cautiously recommended.","July 24, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I feel the length is ok. Any longer and it would have overstayed it's welcome.\nYou can't really die. When your hearts are empty you simply restart the room.\nThere is a quick room restart/reset option, or you can simply walk out of a room to reset it.\nCompleted/solved rooms will mostly stay solved so you can easily travel through them. This even holds for partially solved rooms.\nConsYou can't always complete a puzzle. Sometimes you need other/more tools. I wasted a lot of time and experienced a bunch of frustration before an Internet search told me I couldn't do some of them. But, because you don't know which you can't do, it takes the fun away trying to figure them out.\nI wish there was a (better) hint system so you could pass puzzles you really can't solve without help.\nThe constant backtracking to find puzzles to solve is a useless time waster. There is a teleporting system, but you'll still walk back and forth the same paths countless times.\nI personally didn't like the boss fights. I'm not all that dexterous with a controller so failed often. I'm not a big fan of trial-and-error action scenes.\nYou can't really die, so the enemies are mostly a nuisance that gets in your way.

A good buy at sale price.","August 21, 2013","true","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Your goal is to explore the castle and use the riches you find to enter other dungeons and find tools that help you progress farther in the castle.\n\nThis game has two key strengths. The first is that the items are very interesting, and they each combine in interesting ways. The second is that this game has amazing replay value. You get three items, and you can use all three to win, but you only need two. For a challenge, try beating the game with each combination of two weapons. This game is also built for speed-running, and it will take a lot of planning to figure out how to get the speed run achievements.\n\nI'd say this game's main weakness is the bosses. It's a big difficulty spike, and the method for defeating them is never straightforward. The hints help a lot, but the battles can still be tough even when you know what to do. That leads to the other weakness: the controls. They're not terrible, and you'll get used to them as you play, but there were too many times when I died in combat because I wasn't moving the way I wanted to, and many enemies aren't knocked back when hit.\n\nA few other things to mention: the puzzles can get pretty tough, the death penalty is that you have to restart the room at full health (which isn't even a penalty most of the time), and the game has little story, but the humor was a lot better than I had expected from the previews. Also, the first playthrough will last around 3-5 hours.\n\nSo, despite this game's rather stupid name, I enjoyed it, and I'd say it's worth picking up if you enjoy Zelda-style games (try out the 2D Zeldas first if you're not familiar with them). I'd wait to pick it up at half price, though.","November 3, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple enough to be aprochable to anyone but with a good number of extra puzzles one can do to really chalange themselves if desired. There is also a lot of adult-level humor to the game with some amusing bits here and there. Its very short however; the game is only 6-8 hours long unless you want to go back and do a second (or third) playthrough to figure out the challanging puzzles. My other peeve with the game is health and death are trivial; if you die you restart at your current room so other than boss fights, death is little more than a mild inconveniance.

The game is a little short, but at this pricepoint it does achieve a respectable 3-4 hours on average the first time, but obviously in less time if you don't do the treasure puzzles. It also has a good amount of replay value. Loads of puzzles can be solved in several ways and there are plenty of shortcuts that require some serious thinking to get through. You can buy the 3 main items in whatever order you want (buying the Ice Wand - the most expensive item - first makes the game significantly harder), you can can reach the last boss without all the items and there are even 4 separate versions of the last boss fight, so you can finish the game without all the items (there are achievements for doing so).\nThen there's also speed-running functionality built into the game. You can apparently finish the game in 15minutes somehow... I could barely do it under an hour when I tried (without memorizing all the puzzles tho).\n\nAnd let's not forget the lovely graphics and funny dialogue. The "wobble" graphics are very unique, quite unlike anything I've ever seen. Kind of like a comic-book game in movement? That's probably the best way I can describe it.\n\nThe game does have one pretty poor part though: the combat. It's just clunky and kind of serves more as a way to add variation between puzzles. I can't say I've enjoyed the combat in any isometric 4-directional movement game though, so it might not be something everyone is bothered by. The boss fights are better than the other fights as they kind of involve puzzles in the fight.\n\n\nIt's a great puzzle game well worth playing. If you're even remotely interested in puzzle games I would recommend giving this one a try.","October 9, 2014","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a puzzle game it's surprisingly challenging and the different mechanics work well together and lend to some interesting stages. The design of the puzzles actually reminds me a lot of Portal in how they're constructed and the lateral thinking that you have to apply sometimes (and not just because there's a portal wand in the game).\n\nHowever the game is pretty short, I was able to get the achievement for beating it in 3 hours on my first playthrough and I thought I was taking it slow. There's replay value in that puzzles that are easy with say the portal wand are much much harder when you try to brute force it using just the ice wand, and doing the Wanderer achievement was very difficult and at times I had to use a walkthrough which is something I never do. The collectables are entirely pointless (they even say so in the game), the bosses and combat in general is frustrating and not fun at all, and the entire game can feel shallow but there's fun to be had. I got it for nearly nothing on the humble bundle and I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $5 for it based on its length but if you like puzzle games you'll probably have a lot of fun with it. I just wish they focused more on the puzzles and took out the combat parts of it entirely, since they serve no purpose and will end up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off more than anything.\n\nEDIT: I forgot one of the most important aspects for me which is linux support (if you're running on Windows you can just skip over this). This game does support linux and plays great on it compared to other ports on steam, with fully working achievements unlike say Postal 2 (which still bothers me to this day). HOWEVER the controller support is wonky. The first time I ever started the game I calibrated my controller, and everything worked perfectly. I close the game, restart it, and the controls for the analog stick are completely broken, the character will walk when I dont press anything, will go in the opposite direction of what I tell it to, and generally it's unplayable with the stick now even though it worked perfectly the first time, and recalibration did nothing to fix it. Thankfully I was able to map movement to the dpad instead which was fine, but since I'm using a ps3 controller and the dualshock 3's dpad is garbage it was pretty annoying to control like that, though everything else worked perfectly.","June 17, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not very good (read: patient) with most puzzle games but this game manages to pace puzzling, fighting and exploring pretty well. It has a couple of really great challenges in all three departments and all in all is a breath of fresh air.\nUnlike some indie games, Ittle Dew has no anoying screenfilling pixel graphics that make you want to break out the NES for some actual retro games. But nice, almost hand-drawn, colourful graphics that are pleasing to the eye. The gameplay is consistent and solid, dialogue whimsical but never boring.\n\nIt's difficult to say anything bad about the game because the whole package is just such a good example of an indie game done right. If anything it isn't a "full title" only in the sense that it isn't a very long game and will last for about 3-4 hours on your first playthrough.","June 22, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lonethefox/recommended/241320/","Lonethefox","Raccoon King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lonethefox/","222 products in account","A fun little game with pleasant cartoony graphics. It has a strong focus on puzzles which you solve by pushing blocks onto switches and killing enemies. The game in general is somewhat reminiscent of Zelda. The puzzles are challenging but not enough to be frustrating. The game is pretty short and took me about 3 hours to finish, including a tiny bit of sidetracking. It took around an extra 2 to actually complete every puzzle/area.\n\nI do have some problems with the game however, the boss fights felt out of place and I didn't enjoy them. I was also frustrated with the controls, the game uses the arrow keys as well as A,S,Z,X which in my opinion was an extremely awkward choice of keys, I frequently confused each of the keys despite playing the game for hours.\n\nFInally, while I enjoyed the solving the puzzles required to beat the main game, I found some of the outside puzzles very annoying to solve, there are a lot of things that the game doesn't explain to you, like the fact that you can bounce portals and ice off of frozen walls, things like this end up being part of how you are meant to solve the puzzles so if you don't know about these things these kind of puzzles can be very difficult to complete.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game and the main story has just the right difficulty level for people who people who are decent at puzzle games. The puzzles outside the main story like those in the Master Cave or Compost Crypt seem to be more for seasoned puzzle solvers.\nIt's a nice game but I feel that for its short length, it'd be more accurately priced at $5.","June 7, 2014","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not expect to like this game all that much; I had picked it up in a bundle this was one of the lesser reasons for me to want to pick up the bundle; at the time. After having played it to completion at least once; I can safely say that it feels like a more puzzily version of an old Legend of Zelda game, which is nice.\n\nPros\n\nThe Art Style - I really enjoyed the art style. It's very comically utitilized throughout the game, and suited the mood perfectly throughout.\n\nThe Difficulty - I felt the difficulty was really well realized. I rarely ran into puzzles or situations that gave me any significant trouble; there were a few times I felt challenged but overall the balance was well realized.\n\nThe Music - I liked the music. It was ominous where necessary, as well as jaunty where needed. Could get rather old if stuck on a puzzle, but otherwise it was utilized effectively.\n\nCons\n\nThe Gameplay - This is more a subjective gripe than anything else; I felt that the gameplay could be rather clunky at times. I think my major issue was more often related to the hit box of the character; there were times, especially when dealing with projectiles, where I would get hit and not feel like it was well represented. It was not common, but happened enough to be annoying. I think the perspective is what complicated it further at times.\n\nThe Puzzles - Once again, subjective gripe. I don't like puzzles. This game has them in spades. They're all right, but some were complicated enough to frustrate me and pull me out of the experience.\n\nThe Price Point - I hate bringing it up, but the "cost-per-hour" price point is rather lackluster here. True, you can always replay through the game and try to do so differently than before; but I personally don't have much motivation to do so. That said, if you don't mind the price point, you will be in for a good short experience; unless you're even worse at puzzles than I am, in which case you'll likely get your money's worth.\n\nAt the end of the day I do enjoy this game. It's surprising too given my lack of mirth for puzzle games as a whole, but at the right price point it's a nice experience. I wouldn't recommend this game over many others; but if you find it for cheap enough during a sale I wouldn't recommend against it. Cautiously recommended.","July 24, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I would have to disagree with some other reviewers that this game is a rip-off of the Zelda series.\n\nSurprisingly, I found quite a few of the puzzles to be more challenging than I've found in Zelda games (and yes, I remember the water temple in OoT.)  The developers did an excellent job of creating some difficult puzzles which take all of the available tools to solve (especially in the optional Master Cave.)  The interaction between the freezing rod and the portal rod was especially ingenious.  Plus, the game itself is quite tongue-in-cheek, which keeps it pretty lighthearted.  I was pleased to see the random commentary when walking up to some random objects throughout the game.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy games that make me think, and this game definitely accomplished that.  Additionally, I found Ittle Dew to have decent replay value due to the added challenge of trying to complete the game with varying combinations of the tools (rather than all of them.)\n\nIn the end, if you enjoy puzzle-heavy games in the same vein as classic Legend of Zelda (and have a sense of humor), then Ittle Dew is worth the purchase.","December 31, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Mechanically, Ittle Dew works just about as well as you'd expect. You can walk around, hit enemies, but the real fun comes from the various puzzles. Like a Zelda game, Ittle Dew has an assortment of items that you'll utilize to solve puzzles. However, unlike a Zelda game, where you'll usually find yourself with 7-8 unique items, Ittle Dew only has. This isn't a major issue, for two reasons. Ittle Dew is a shorter game than Zelda games, and two the way that item's works together creates a large amount of replayabilty, due the game's design allowing for puzzles to be solved in multiple different ways. Ittle Dew's three items are a fire sword, which should be fairly self-explanatory, you hit things and light them on fire, a Portal Wand, which allows you to create blocks and teleport objects around and a Ice Wand which allows you to freeze objects. A large portion of the games puzzles are solvable in multiple different ways using any number of the game's items. Even beating the game only requires 2/3 of the items, this encourages exploration in the game world and experimentation with the game's mechanics as you figure out how to get to the end with a limited toolset, and I found doing so to be very compelling. There is also a fair amount of optional content, from hidden collectibles that require optional puzzles to be found, to a couple of optional dungeons. Competetive players will also enjoy trying to figure out optimal routes through the game in order to beat the game quickly.\nWhile I can prise Ittle Dew puzzle solving mechanics and overall design, it's not a perfect game. There's some combat throughout Ittle Dew, and frankly it's not very fun. More often than not, I found that having to kill the enemies in a room detracted from the fun puzzles that I should be solving in the room. There's also bosses, but they're mostly one-trick ponies. You'll figure out how to defeat them quite quickly, and they rarely pose a threat. The combat is a minor part of the game, but I can't help but think it could of been more deeply intergrated into the best parts of the game, the puzzle solving.","March 2, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzels start off really easy but they are nearly impossible at the end (for me). You start off with just a stick and get more weapons/magick as for progres. A few times you lose all your stuff just to get you to use the new weapon/magick. This might seem annoying but you get it back soon enough. I like the fact that the world is pretty much open. Once you encounter a puzzle you can't figur out, you just continue somewhere else. Then you get a new item and suddenly the puzzle makes sense. The little jokes in between are funny, and the storyline is ok. The only negative about this game are the little graphical and audio problems. In the little rooms where the crazy old man was tied up, the foor was just black. I think the texture tiles were missing. And some tiles didn't fit perfectly, leaving a small green line at the side. And I didn't have any sound. I played this on Linux, so I might miss some dependencies. Overall is this a great game to relax, puzzle, smash and admire the art assets.","February 23, 2014","true","6.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/241320/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Traditional Zelda is a style of gameplay that is near and dear to many people. The top down adventure makes for some creative puzzle situations and hugely detailed maps. After many years of tinkering with the formula, Nintendo is finally returning to their heritage with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.\n\nWhat are gamers to do in the meantime, though? If one is not a fan of the 3D games or the DS titles, what kind of game will fill the void? Enter Ittle Dew, a top down adventure game from indie dev Ludosity. What the game lacks in innovative puzzle and world design, it more than makes up for with charm and game feel.\n\nThe plotline for Ittle Dew is incredibly simple. Your character washes up on the shore of an island and wants to get off. The caretaker of a shop will build you a raft as long as you go through some dungeons he has set up. You also need to pay him for the items he sells, so there is a main hub dungeon that will let you accrue some cash.\n\nThis is probably the weakest element of the game. While the original Zelda game did not really possess a story of any kind, forgoing a narrative in today’s age is a curious decision. One can personally believe that gameplay speaks above all else, but without a strong desire to continue, some gamers may not even be bother to check Ittle Dew out.\n\nThankfully, the puzzle designs in Ittle Dew are fairly strong. Stripping down the Zelda formula to its basics, Ittle Dew gives players very limited commands to deal with. Controls are essentially walking with the joystick, the four face buttons used for specific items and two shoulders buttons for a map and hint screen.\n\nThe hint screen is very nicely done, too. Instead of spelling out solutions or talking in cryptic riddles, the game uses the humorous character of Tippsie to lightly insult the player while giving some key hints. Things like, “You’ll only need your fire sword for this room,” are better tests of skill than detailing exactly where to swing your item.\n\nThe specific items collected are a teleport rod, a fire sword and an ice rod. In an interesting twist, there is no proper order of progression in the game. The best aspect of is how non-linear the design is. Upon completing the journey, I was under the belief that any player would have to acquire all three of the weapons to finish their quest. That actually isn’t the case. Some of the dungeons even have shortcuts direct to the boss rooms.\n\nAlong with shortcuts and paths for skipping items, the game also has hidden dungeons for collecting extra health and cards. The cards don’t really offer any purpose to the game, but their rooms have some insidiously obtuse puzzle designs. I was stumped in one room for a solid 20 minutes before stumbling upon the answer.\n\nWhen you are transported to any dungeon for a specific item, you only need your wits to get through. No puzzles require another objects or skills you do not possess. This alleviates a lot of frustration from the proceedings.\n\nThere really isn’t much in the way of challenge, however. If you die, the game simply restarts you in the exact same room with full health. Other than how the sword’s arc doesn’t fully surround your character, the only time one will get annoyed is when they cannot solve a puzzle quickly.\n\nA good mention must go to the writing behind Ittle Dew. Everything is very self-referential and parody laden. Genre tropes like collecting hearts and destroying pots all make some kind of appearance. Even the nonsensical nature of enemy placement gets mentioned for being so pointless.\n\nYour main character revels in eating hearts and even wishes to just smack things around. The bosses utter some ridiculously incomprehensible catch phrases and then admit to not even knowing what they were talking about. One cannot help but crack a smile while playing.\n\nEven the ending is funny. While a rather obvious plot twist occurs, when the final battle comes to a close, the game pokes fun at how most final bosses just kind of give up or don’t take a more obvious approach.\n\nSadly, while Ittle Dew might be great at questioning why adventure games follow specific mechanics, the game really does nothing to spice them up. One shouldn’t be displeased with a fairly high quality Zelda-\nlike game, but a lack of innovation really does hurt the final product.\n\nThere are some texture designs on the world map that are misleading, as well. For the most part, you cannot walk behind any of the trees in the game. Some of the hidden dungeons are behind them, though. Enemies also disappear behind the trees and are completely invisible to the player.\n\nFor that matter, the world map doesn’t really serve any purpose other than to move you from point A to point B. Hiding extraneous items behind puzzles is a great incentive for replay value, but giving players some other reason to explore would go a long way to creating a believable world.\n\nThere is a bonus dungeon hidden in the fields. This acts as the penultimate test of your skills, requiring every item in the game to fully complete. There are 12 rooms and each one gets progressively more challenging in skill. This serves as a nice little bonus to an otherwise very short game.\n\nTo sum everything up, while Ittle Dew might not be the second coming of adventure gaming or a masterpiece of epic proportions, the game provides plenty of wit and humor along with some decently mind bending puzzles. The game also controls nicely.\n\nFor $14, one could do much worse. Ludosity certainly does not get points for creativity, but their craftsmanship is noble. This game may not be Zelda, but Ittle Dew.

The developers did an excellent job of creating some difficult puzzles which take all of the available tools to solve (especially in the optional Master Cave.)  The interaction between the freezing rod and the portal rod was especially ingenious.  Plus, the game itself is quite tongue-in-cheek, which keeps it pretty lighthearted.

I thought it was some cute zelda clone at first but it's really a lot more than that.  Where as zelda games focuses on completing temples go gain items and destroy the big bad, this game is more about puzzle solving.  There are only a handful of items in the game to begin with but the most valuable resource you have is your own wit.....and tipsy if you get stuck.  The game is really replayable by challenging yourself with faster times and the last acheivement 'just dew it' will take a while even for the most experienced gamers.  Plus you have the master dungeon which will throw you for a loop with a boss at the end that is quite unexpected.  I cannot say enough good things about this game, pick it up, solve some puzzles and have a glorious time.  I want ittle dew 2","December 28, 2013","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ittle Dew is a charming and artistically beautiful game that simply makes fun of 2D Zelda games and I have got to say, this kind of works.\n\nOn the other hand, this game brings nothing new to the table but it wasn’t a disadvantage for me, I’ve had fun while playing it, puzzle sections can be difficult though , sometimes I had to take a brake and approach this game differently. I liked it, it was somewhat enjoyable for me, especially during the dialogue sections, they were funny and very well written.\n\nAn equally significant aspect of the game was its art style, It was a pleasure looking at the vibrant art during my playthrough which made this game one of the best presented block puzzle game ever.\n\nDespite the great art style and clever writing, this game did had some problems, for ex. its length, I was able to beat this game in less than 4 hours, I know it might turn some people off but I have realized that in some cases this is not a disadvantage but in this case, well, it was but one of the recent examples where the short game can be successful is the game called Gone Home made by The Fullbright Company which could be completed in 2 hours but Gone Home is a completely different game and again in Ittle Dew, It just wasn’t enough, to be honest I wanted more.\n\nIn the end, Ittle Dew is an adorable block puzzle game, with a decent gameplay and a crafty writing. For this price, you won’t be disappointed, just don’t expect it to be a Zelda clone because it pretty much makes fun of this game which sometimes can be very entertaining.","March 9, 2014","true","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, I would have to disagree with some other reviewers that this game is a rip-off of the Zelda series.\n\nSurprisingly, I found quite a few of the puzzles to be more challenging than I've found in Zelda games (and yes, I remember the water temple in OoT.)  The developers did an excellent job of creating some difficult puzzles which take all of the available tools to solve (especially in the optional Master Cave.)  The interaction between the freezing rod and the portal rod was especially ingenious.  Plus, the game itself is quite tongue-in-cheek, which keeps it pretty lighthearted.  I was pleased to see the random commentary when walking up to some random objects throughout the game.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy games that make me think, and this game definitely accomplished that.  Additionally, I found Ittle Dew to have decent replay value due to the added challenge of trying to complete the game with varying combinations of the tools (rather than all of them.)\n\nIn the end, if you enjoy puzzle-heavy games in the same vein as classic Legend of Zelda (and have a sense of humor), then Ittle Dew is worth the purchase.","December 31, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The first is that the items are very interesting, and they each combine in interesting ways. The second is that this game has amazing replay value. You get three items, and you can use all three to win, but you only need two. For a challenge, try beating the game with each combination of two weapons. This game is also built for speed-running, and it will take a lot of planning to figure out how to get the speed run achievements.\n\nI'd say this game's main weakness is the bosses. It's a big difficulty spike, and the method for defeating them is never straightforward. The hints help a lot, but the battles can still be tough even when you know what to do. That leads to the other weakness: the controls. They're not terrible, and you'll get used to them as you play, but there were too many times when I died in combat because I wasn't moving the way I wanted to, and many enemies aren't knocked back when hit.\n\nA few other things to mention: the puzzles can get pretty tough, the death penalty is that you have to restart the room at full health (which isn't even a penalty most of the time), and the game has little story, but the humor was a lot better than I had expected from the previews. Also, the first playthrough will last around 3-5 hours.\n\nSo, despite this game's rather stupid name, I enjoyed it, and I'd say it's worth picking up if you enjoy Zelda-style games (try out the 2D Zeldas first if you're not familiar with them). I'd wait to pick it up at half price, though.","November 3, 2013","true","5.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The level design is really good. There are a ton of tough puzzles to work through including an optional master dungeon with some truly mind-overloading challenges. The game doesn't rely much on reflexes as the enemies are easy enough to defeat, even in numbers. Where Ittle Dew really shines is in the level design. You will need to think about things, sometimes for a long while, in order to finish. The regular quest takes around 5 hours to finish. I definitely recommend Ittle Dew, especially to Zelda fans.","September 20, 2013","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Simple enough to be aprochable to anyone but with a good number of extra puzzles one can do to really chalange themselves if desired. There is also a lot of adult-level humor to the game with some amusing bits here and there. Its very short however; the game is only 6-8 hours long unless you want to go back and do a second (or third) playthrough to figure out the challanging puzzles. My other peeve with the game is health and death are trivial; if you die you restart at your current room so other than boss fights, death is little more than a mild inconveniance. Other than that it was a fun game, worth $10 or less. 3/5","November 12, 2013","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzels start off really easy but they are nearly impossible at the end (for me). You start off with just a stick and get more weapons/magick as for progres. A few times you lose all your stuff just to get you to use the new weapon/magick. This might seem annoying but you get it back soon enough. I like the fact that the world is pretty much open. Once you encounter a puzzle you can't figur out, you just continue somewhere else. Then you get a new item and suddenly the puzzle makes sense. The little jokes in between are funny, and the storyline is ok. The only negative about this game are the little graphical and audio problems. In the little rooms where the crazy old man was tied up, the foor was just black. I think the texture tiles were missing. And some tiles didn't fit perfectly, leaving a small green line at the side. And I didn't have any sound. I played this on Linux, so I might miss some dependencies.

What sets Ittle Dew apart from Nintendo's classic franchise are a willingness to make fun of itself and extremely streamlined gameplay. It's so streamlined, in fact, that you can easily beat the game in only a handful of hours. There is a deck of character cards scattered throughout the world that could potentially extend your play time, but they aren't very rewarding to collect. Plus if you wait until you are fully equipped, many of these optional puzzles are easier than they were intended to be. Speaking of equipment, Ittle Dew's arsenal would leave Link green with envy. The portal wand especially introduces some very unique puzzles that elevate the game above standard-fare LoZ block pushing and flip switching. There's still plenty of that, but the game is always aware of its source material and freely pokes fun of it. The first time I picked a heart up off the ground, I nearly fell out of my chair laughing. From the irreverent sense of humor to the squiggly hand drawn graphics, Ittle Dew is a charming game that holds its own against its apparent competitor.","February 10, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a puzzle game it's surprisingly challenging and the different mechanics work well together and lend to some interesting stages. The design of the puzzles actually reminds me a lot of Portal in how they're constructed and the lateral thinking that you have to apply sometimes (and not just because there's a portal wand in the game).\n\nHowever the game is pretty short, I was able to get the achievement for beating it in 3 hours on my first playthrough and I thought I was taking it slow. There's replay value in that puzzles that are easy with say the portal wand are much much harder when you try to brute force it using just the ice wand, and doing the Wanderer achievement was very difficult and at times I had to use a walkthrough which is something I never do. The collectables are entirely pointless (they even say so in the game), the bosses and combat in general is frustrating and not fun at all, and the entire game can feel shallow but there's fun to be had. I got it for nearly nothing on the humble bundle and I wouldn't recommend paying much more than $5 for it based on its length but if you like puzzle games you'll probably have a lot of fun with it. I just wish they focused more on the puzzles and took out the combat parts of it entirely, since they serve no purpose and will end up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you off more than anything.\n\nEDIT: I forgot one of the most important aspects for me which is linux support (if you're running on Windows you can just skip over this). This game does support linux and plays great on it compared to other ports on steam, with fully working achievements unlike say Postal 2 (which still bothers me to this day). HOWEVER the controller support is wonky. The first time I ever started the game I calibrated my controller, and everything worked perfectly. I close the game, restart it, and the controls for the analog stick are completely broken, the character will walk when I dont press anything, will go in the opposite direction of what I tell it to, and generally it's unplayable with the stick now even though it worked perfectly the first time, and recalibration did nothing to fix it. Thankfully I was able to map movement to the dpad instead which was fine, but since I'm using a ps3 controller and the dualshock 3's dpad is garbage it was pretty annoying to control like that, though everything else worked perfectly.","June 17, 2015","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tippsie, her loyal sidekick, will give her some hints during the adventure. The only human being of the island, who is also to the manager of the local store, proposes her an exchange: a raft to leave the island, in exchange for an artefact hidden in the castle of the island.\n\nA real adventure for the young Ittle Dew starts: resolution of riddles to move forward in the rooms of the castle; harvest of weapons and objects which will help her in the task; fight against monsters and boss until reach her goal.\n\nThe whole is made in a funny style, both in drawing and in dialogues. Monsters are completely stupid, and there is a lot of jokes about RPG: the hero who eats literally hearts to regenerate HP, the HP bar made of hearts drawn on papers and maintained between them with adhesive tape, jokes about useless items or achievements... We also collect cards of the bestiary of the game, which describe every character and their tastes in a parodic way. So we learn that some monsters like french fries, that other one is dizzy while it is a flying monster, etc...\n\nThe graphic style is original, with a real identity, childish and very colored style. Sounds and music are also very nice. On the other hand, it is a short game, between 3 and 4 hours to fully finish it, that is to say by ending the game, the secondary donjons and by collecting all the objects. Everything depends on your speed to understand and to solve the riddles. However, speedrunners and achievement hunters will be satisfied. Indeed, to get all the achievements, you will need to finish the game several times, and one in particular in less than 15 minutes!","July 12, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the simplistic graphics, the adventure tag or the RPG liked screen shots. Ittle Dew is a game with minimalist and nonsensicle plot with a little exploring with tonnes of puzzle.\n\nIn this game, you need to explore dungeon and progress by solving puzzles and unlocking doors. Each area may consists of 1 to several puzzles that you need to solve with the aid of certain weapons. They can be more than 1 approach to solving the puzzle. Each room is reset when you leave the area and coming back. Solving the puzzle will then unlock the doors permanently.\n\nThe puzzles can be challenging especially the optional ones. The mechanics can be simply but the logic can be tricky. If you longed for greater challenge, you can always visit the master dungeon (which is optional), but be warned as you might need to juice the brain a little.\n\nThe boss fights can be tough as there are no hint on how you should approach or tackle them. My guess is there were meant to be that way so it seems like another puzzle for you to solve along the way.\n\nMy only beef with the game is the achievement. Personally I think there is no reason to replay them as the puzzles and maps are the same even though there are several ways to tackle them. You might already solve them during your first gameplay but having all three weapons automatically cancels the achievement.","October 6, 2015","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/241320/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Traditional Zelda is a style of gameplay that is near and dear to many people. The top down adventure makes for some creative puzzle situations and hugely detailed maps. After many years of tinkering with the formula, Nintendo is finally returning to their heritage with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds.\n\nWhat are gamers to do in the meantime, though? If one is not a fan of the 3D games or the DS titles, what kind of game will fill the void? Enter Ittle Dew, a top down adventure game from indie dev Ludosity. What the game lacks in innovative puzzle and world design, it more than makes up for with charm and game feel.\n\nThe plotline for Ittle Dew is incredibly simple. Your character washes up on the shore of an island and wants to get off. The caretaker of a shop will build you a raft as long as you go through some dungeons he has set up. You also need to pay him for the items he sells, so there is a main hub dungeon that will let you accrue some cash.\n\nThis is probably the weakest element of the game. While the original Zelda game did not really possess a story of any kind, forgoing a narrative in today’s age is a curious decision. One can personally believe that gameplay speaks above all else, but without a strong desire to continue, some gamers may not even be bother to check Ittle Dew out.\n\nThankfully, the puzzle designs in Ittle Dew are fairly strong. Stripping down the Zelda formula to its basics, Ittle Dew gives players very limited commands to deal with. Controls are essentially walking with the joystick, the four face buttons used for specific items and two shoulders buttons for a map and hint screen.\n\nThe hint screen is very nicely done, too. Instead of spelling out solutions or talking in cryptic riddles, the game uses the humorous character of Tippsie to lightly insult the player while giving some key hints. Things like, “You’ll only need your fire sword for this room,” are better tests of skill than detailing exactly where to swing your item.\n\nThe specific items collected are a teleport rod, a fire sword and an ice rod. In an interesting twist, there is no proper order of progression in the game. The best aspect of is how non-linear the design is. Upon completing the journey, I was under the belief that any player would have to acquire all three of the weapons to finish their quest. That actually isn’t the case. Some of the dungeons even have shortcuts direct to the boss rooms.\n\nAlong with shortcuts and paths for skipping items, the game also has hidden dungeons for collecting extra health and cards. The cards don’t really offer any purpose to the game, but their rooms have some insidiously obtuse puzzle designs. I was stumped in one room for a solid 20 minutes before stumbling upon the answer.\n\nWhen you are transported to any dungeon for a specific item, you only need your wits to get through. No puzzles require another objects or skills you do not possess. This alleviates a lot of frustration from the proceedings.\n\nThere really isn’t much in the way of challenge, however. If you die, the game simply restarts you in the exact same room with full health. Other than how the sword’s arc doesn’t fully surround your character, the only time one will get annoyed is when they cannot solve a puzzle quickly.\n\nA good mention must go to the writing behind Ittle Dew. Everything is very self-referential and parody laden. Genre tropes like collecting hearts and destroying pots all make some kind of appearance. Even the nonsensical nature of enemy placement gets mentioned for being so pointless.\n\nYour main character revels in eating hearts and even wishes to just smack things around. The bosses utter some ridiculously incomprehensible catch phrases and then admit to not even knowing what they were talking about. One cannot help but crack a smile while playing.\n\nEven the ending is funny. While a rather obvious plot twist occurs, when the final battle comes to a close, the game pokes fun at how most final bosses just kind of give up or don’t take a more obvious approach.\n\nSadly, while Ittle Dew might be great at questioning why adventure games follow specific mechanics, the game really does nothing to spice them up. One shouldn’t be displeased with a fairly high quality Zelda-\nlike game, but a lack of innovation really does hurt the final product.\n\nThere are some texture designs on the world map that are misleading, as well. For the most part, you cannot walk behind any of the trees in the game. Some of the hidden dungeons are behind them, though. Enemies also disappear behind the trees and are completely invisible to the player.\n\nFor that matter, the world map doesn’t really serve any purpose other than to move you from point A to point B. Hiding extraneous items behind puzzles is a great incentive for replay value, but giving players some other reason to explore would go a long way to creating a believable world.\n\nThere is a bonus dungeon hidden in the fields. This acts as the penultimate test of your skills, requiring every item in the game to fully complete. There are 12 rooms and each one gets progressively more challenging in skill. This serves as a nice little bonus to an otherwise very short game.\n\nTo sum everything up, while Ittle Dew might not be the second coming of adventure gaming or a masterpiece of epic proportions, the game provides plenty of wit and humor along with some decently mind bending puzzles. The game also controls nicely.\n\nFor $14, one could do much worse. Ludosity certainly does not get points for creativity, but their craftsmanship is noble. This game may not be Zelda, but Ittle Dew.

The video actually does a great job of showing what the game is like to play, so if you like the look, get it. I personally really enjoyed the gameplay, and thought the art style and humour was excellent. I think the gameplay is actually better than that in every other game in this genre (zelda clone) that Ive played because its been designed to lower frustration, repetition and maximise enjoyment (eg dying costs nothing, no backtracking required ever, hints) while still retaining challenge.\n\nThe only caveat I can give is that its better played with a gamepad, and the gamepad support is broken (you need to remap all gamepad controls from gamepad 0 to gamepad 1, and you need to remap the second hori and vert directions everytime you play, else the controls act like you are continually pushing UP - super annoying - these bugs are months old and havent been patched, so I wouldnt expect them to be now). That said, its a easily remedied minor gripe and a small impediment to this delightful game.","November 26, 2013","true","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Tippsie, her loyal sidekick, will give her some hints during the adventure. The only human being of the island, who is also to the manager of the local store, proposes her an exchange: a raft to leave the island, in exchange for an artefact hidden in the castle of the island.\n\nA real adventure for the young Ittle Dew starts: resolution of riddles to move forward in the rooms of the castle; harvest of weapons and objects which will help her in the task; fight against monsters and boss until reach her goal.\n\nThe whole is made in a funny style, both in drawing and in dialogues. Monsters are completely stupid, and there is a lot of jokes about RPG: the hero who eats literally hearts to regenerate HP, the HP bar made of hearts drawn on papers and maintained between them with adhesive tape, jokes about useless items or achievements... We also collect cards of the bestiary of the game, which describe every character and their tastes in a parodic way. So we learn that some monsters like french fries, that other one is dizzy while it is a flying monster, etc...\n\nThe graphic style is original, with a real identity, childish and very colored style.

You can freeze walls to mirror portal projectiles or freeze ignited bombs to stop them from exploding a short time until they dew.

Easy fun casual game to beat that could turn into hours of headaches if you want to chase acheivements.  As difficult as you want to make it.

I think this game needs a better Navi then the flying fox.","January 7","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I laughed all my way in the play through.\nThis game is some sort of similar to the Legend of Zelda but in funny way.\nI'm still wondering what is that artifact.\n\n\nI rate : 7/10","February 21","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
