But this isn't a Quake 2 review.\n\nQuake 2 Mission Pack 2: Ground Zero is the final installement of the Quake 2 trilogy (Excluding Zaero and Juggernaut, both of which I am trying to find at a decent price ESPECIALLY Zaero over 50 dollars for just the disk!) But that is besides the point.\n\nThe story is pretty much, after the events of Quake 2  and the Reckoning, all the units are attempting to leave orbit because of their victory... however they can't because  the Strogg's Gravity Well is forcing them in oribt. Quickly, they send a bunch of units down but only a few survive, you play as Stepchild whom crash landed onto one of the mines of the Stroggs and now you much survive, kill the Widow and blow up the Gravity Well letting everyone survive.\n\nThis game bleeds Quake 2 and is an excellent expansion, sure it is a tad short at only 14 levels, but just like the original and the Reckoning it is made up of Hub Worlds, called Units, there are 5 (There are 10 in the original game). Every hub has a central mission and many mini missions that add up to finishing that central one. From blowing up the mine core to killing the Widow there is quite a bit of variety for such a small expansion pack.\n\nThe new weapons are cool in their own right, sure they won't replace the BFK10k but why would they? If they did then the game's challenge would be a mininum. The weapons range from a Nailgun from Quake 1 to a lazer that burns people! It is a ton of fun to use the weapons and adds more variety. The new enemies are mostly just upgrades of the originals, but there are some brand new ones with spiders that climb on the roof!\n\nThe final boss, not going to spoil it but, is a lot more fun then the previous attempt on Reckoning, mostly because its a whole new boss and not just a redesigned arena version of the original.\n\nThe levels are nice and have interestning areas to explore, from the unstable mines to a toxtic waste dump there sure is a nice ammount of variety here. And is just fun to explore everything.\n\nDo I recomend this? No and Yes, I recomend playing Quake 2 and only if you like that then play this, because this is an expansion after all.\n\nHowever, if you are a diehard Quake fan like me then play it if you haven't already!\n\n","December 6, 2014","true","1.5"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

You, and a few marines like you, are the lucky ones. You've made it down in one piece and are still able to contact the fleet. The Gravity Well, the Strogg's newest weapon in its arsenal against mankind, is operational. With the fleet around Stroggo's, 5% of ground forces surviving, and that number dwindling by the second, your orders have changed: free your comrades. Destroy the Gravity Well.\nQuake 2 Ground Zero is a expansion pack for the 1997 Smash hit Quake 2. The expansion pack adds new bosses, weapons and new Stroggo's to slaughter. The new weapons leave something to be desired. For example the ETF Rifle which is basically a clone of the first Quake's nail gun is mediocore at best, especially on the high difficulties. Poor bullet velocity but average damage. The Proximity grenade launcher is pretty much exactly the same as the normal grenade launcher but attaches grenades to walls which explode if you or a enemy comes close, The rest of the other weapons arent worth mentioning.\n\nThe new enemies in general are fun to dispatch and not to difficult even on Nightmare difficulty. However a new enemy was introduced namely "Wall Turrets" which are little security guns which fire as soon as they see you, And worst of all the wonderful map designers though it would be great to put these in the crappiest places you almost never look at. I lost count of how many times i would enter a door way only to get shot in the back of the head due to a turret mounted directly above the door frame. This was probably my biggest gripe with this game.\n\nThen come the bosses. Oh God the bosses.... If your playing on nightmare difficulty you will learn a lesson in sheer frustration.  My only word of advice is ensure you use ammo sparingly at all times and save up all the Cell packs you can.\n\nMy final thoughts are that while this expansion pack was enjoyable, but the difficulty spikes can really push your patience limit.\n\nFinal Score 70/100","November 6, 2015","true","15.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

There's not much to say, this expansion consist of a fistful of "hubs" with different levels each. The gameplay remains unchanged, and the only particular things are a couple monsters and weapons added. The level structure here looks flawed to me as I've run into a couple of incongruence or conflict with mission objectives inside the same Hub (for example go to a level to grab a disc, change level to modify the disc, take it again and go to the previous level again... But once you get there the doors are locked. Ok, let's get back again, there will be another exit... the objective says to modify the disc again... really? Ok, let's do it. Let's find another way and grab that blue key, I might want to look past that blue door... Objective has changed asking me to walk back the same path it asked me two levels back?).\nThis pack is appropriate for those who just want more quake two and don't need any particular revolution in gameplay to enjoy the game and most importantly have the patience to deal with possible objective paradoxes.\nSince this is an expansion pack it requires the original Quake 2 installed and because of this it presents the same incompatibilities of the original game.\n\nI don't recommend this expansion pack because even I didn't enjoy at all the Objective paradoxes, that's an issue given by bad level design. I give 6/10 anyways because someone might still enjoy the extra actions and maps.\n\n+++PROs+++ ENGINE. The Quake II Engine is quite old now, but it still is enjoyable nowadays.\nSOUNDTRACK. Very Badass Soundtrack. 'Nuff said...---CONs--- OBJECTIVE PARADOX. The Hub system in quake 2 isn't really smooth and logic, as enemies will respawn and past objectives might reset (doors, lowered bridges, keys, discs and whatsoever), especially in this Expansion pack. I know it might be me, I could have tried harder, but honestly I still believe the developers should have designed and programmed better to prevent these kind of boring situations.\nCOMPATIBILITY ISSUES. This expansion presents the same compatibility issues you might run into with the original Q2. Luckily there's the Steam community with various solutions and patches that will make this game run flawlessly, as if your i7 with your GTX 970 was an MMX with a Vodoo 3dfx... And, seriously, if you want to exploit more your hardware you can always look up for some Port that will load the game for you with enhanced graphics.","June 4","false","2.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spygentleman/recommended/2340/","spygentleman","KayKay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spygentleman/","187 products in account","Quake 2 Ground Zero is a second mission pack that has been released for the official game. Created by Rogue Entertainment, developers of Strife (A great game btw) putted much more love and challenge than Xatrix's The Reckoning, 1st mission pack for Quake 2. What do i mean by that? I shall reveal it!\n\nThe pack gives you some new weapons such as the powerful ETF Rifle that acts like a Nailgun from Quake 1 with the ability to penetrate the shields or a Tesla Mine which shoots lightning to anyone except you at the very short range with less damage, commonly used to distract or lure the enemy for a better shot. There are also other weapons you can find but i ain't gonna spoil the fun in here other than the fact that this expansion has more new weapons than the previous one.\n\nLike The Reckoning, you have new enemies to deal with, although less than the 1st expansion but it is compensated by their health and their abilities. Such as the sneaky Stalker that attack from unexpected way, DESPICABLE turrets that shoots their chosen ammo such as rockets, blaster or railgun which are extremely smart and more.\n\nSpeaking of the smart enemies, Rogue Entertainment has updated the AI for all of the older enemies as well like: Enforcer won't load his chaingun to shoot, Gunners' grenades are more accurate and worst of all, Tanks are even bigger ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as they will IMMEDIATELY shoot rockets at you once you leave the cover which turns them into the most annoying and worst enemy to deal with (Yet ONE new enemy will give you even hard time to kill him than the Tank itself).\n\nAs hard as it looks like, the Ground Zero brings more new powerups such as the downgraded Quad Damage which is more common to find called "Double Damage", Defender Sphere which reduces your damage you recieve and attacks the enemy etc. Although the multiplayer lets you use even more new powerups than the single player. Oh and no Invulnerability powerup, as it has been replaced with one of the powerups.\n\nOnverall, this expansion will offer you the biggest challenge of all Quake's mission packs giving you new powerups and weapons to play along with new enemies to deal with. Hope your skill is high....as you will need it.","December 7, 2011","true","3.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2340/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Quake 2 Mission Pack: Ground Zero is the second mission pack for the game, being made by Rogue Entertainment and released in 1998. Comes with new single campaign, new mosnters, weapons, items and such.\n\nOnce again id software game that doesn't work out of box. Steam box, that is. May as well copy-paste from review of previous mission pack:\nThis game will not even launch properly without some work. The simplest way is to open game's folder and edit "ground_zero.bat" to delete "+set cddir D:\data\max" line from it. Then launch this .bat file. Steam will count you as launching Quake 2, by the way. Or you can use source port if you don't care about Vanilla experience.\n\nThe music once again was not included. You will have to track it down in some way or another. Or find retail copy. Unless you use source port, Quake 2 reads Redbook music from the first disc drive. You also will have to find and learn neat _inmm program to make music loop correctly.\n\nAnd then there is lack of widescreen support by default, albeit I heard it can easily be edited in config or with source port.\nOh, and it would slutter for me a lot. Unless I would go into Video options in game's menu and then exit, as it got fixed by itself.\nIt also doesn't seem to save configuration so you have to redo in-game options tweaks everytime you launch it.\n\nMultiplayer community, well, I didn't check personally. But I think that it uses same stuff as Quake 2 and no one uses expansions packs.\n\nThe plot of this mission pack is simple. Once again we follow another soldier during human's attack on Strogg planet. And this time you have totally unawesome name "stepchild" and have to politely blow up Gravity Well which trapped human's fleet in planet orbit who are being actively shot by the Big Gun. Good thing you managed to crash.\n\nThis time around the level structure of main campaign changed a bit. Rogue Entertainment, makers of Strife, made Quake 2's kinda-there-hubs take a next step, as their levels are now huge, mazey and may require backtracking. There is still one certain linear way to get through the unit and game usually tells you what to do next in objective, like "go back to previous level now". Or "turn on the three valves" and then you will be spending your time in the level, poking around as you didn't care to remember where valves were.\n\nSad thing is that while I enjoy such exploration aspect, but Quake 2 setting isn't Hexen. It's the kind of setting that is cool in short burst, not the one you want to explore. It's nothing but a boringish black-red tech stuff of tech generic evilness. Of RED colored OpenGL lights. With some heavy-whatever-you-count guitar music grinding on your ears after a while. So eh, not so awesome idea after all.\n\nYou also was given new tools to handle enemies. There is EDF-something that is actually just a nailgun from Q1. Ohai my baby. It's supposed to ignore target's armor and thus in single it's only useful only against new modifications for those jetpack soldiers with shield. Oh well. Plus some continious laser that eats cell ammo like no tommorow, so much that I feel I will rather use BFG than that. Plus grenade launcher that throws proximity mines that are tad weak to be used as a mine. I just shot them when I didn't want grenades to bounce away. Oh, and there is a chainsaw. Chainfist, actually. By the golden holy rule of 90's FPS, it's a melee weapon that sucks.\nToo bad that developers forgot to set keybinds to some of those weapons, so you either have to learn how to make autoexec files or just have to select them clumpsily from inventory.\n\nThen from inventory weapons you got new Double Damage. It's like Quad Damage, but half as good, but more common. Then there is VR Googles which will put you into R-ZONE! Or at least make objects fully red. And various spheres that float above you and do something. Like, Sphere of Defender shoots back at whoever injured you. And then there are gimmicky Tesla throwable devices. Once landed, they take a while to set up and then zap at nearby enemies. Too bad that monsters AI was programmed to not enter this device's range and just to shoot it immeditly, thus there are very little uses for it. Only as distraction. Weapon switching speed in Quake 2 is too slow for much use otherwise.\n\nBut then come the new enemies. Well, there are spider things who can crawl over ceiling and play dead. Fool me once, gib them all. New modification of jetpack Strogg with shield in front. Medic Strogg is now actually dangerous as he also spawns other Stroggs around himself, thus being number one priority target. And good reason to pull out BFG. And there are totally new bosses. Final bosses are supposed to replicate powerups that you currently use, so using Quad Damage means that they do quad damage as well. It still doesn't help to save them much, at least on Normal. Still, awesome.\n\nOh. And turrets.\nFreaking turrets.\nWhile the first hub has none, the game is going to slowly cover the levels with them, hidden and placed in all the corners that you don't expect to see them. They are small, they take 2-3 rockets or railgun shots, they shoot high damage projectiles and often come out from hiding behind you. Even worse if they are armed with rockets. Their AI is also pain, as they predict your movement to shoot ahead and can even keep shooting near the corner where you hid away. In other words, they are pain in the back. And while you may learn to handle them better, despite having to quickload when you get surprised anyway, it doesn't fit to Quake 2 pace at all.\n\nOh, and they say that they improved AI. Mostly means that they made enemies harder. Mostly by making them take less time to shoot. All yay being shot by light guard right as you peek around corner. Light Guards are also more aggresive. And Stroggs shoot grenades more accurately, which might be a good change. Oh, and there are some scripted events too, like shooting something explosive near you as you enter the room.\n\nOverall, with all the difficulty spikes and pacing problems, partly thanks to turrets, as well as setting getting old before the end of a game I think that this mission pack is skippable. Really, not all that fun.","January 27","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Long version: Rogue apparently thought they were still making Strife, which means that a Q2 mission pack somehow features confusing and maze-like maps with terrible backtracking elements. The new weapons range from passable to useless, with the reskinned splash-damaging nailgun being the best, and the chainfist being the worst, since you're required to get up-close to the average Q2 enemy to use it, universally-known as a terrible idea\n\nAnd to complain about both, the level design severely-limits how you can effectively-use the rocket and grenade launcher, two things a Quake game should never have an issue accommodating by design. The cramped and compacted rooms and corridors make using both either suicidal or a total waste of ammo, as enemies will either be on hard-to-hit ledges, blocked by walls/poles/architecture, or too close to where you bathe in the splash damage yourself\n\nAnd then the ENEMIES, every new enemy is a horrible pain to deal with, and not in the fun strategy-deducing way, but the projectiles-that-might-as-well-be-hitscan way, I'm looking at YOU, plasma-shooting spider-thing. The worst addition however is the fact that there are autotracking sentry turrets EVERYWHERE, you generally can't go a minute or two without running-into one, and they hurt, a LOT. They take forever to destroy due to the fact you have to be constantly-moving in order to avoid either their painful blaster shot, or usually-instagibbing rocket shot, and they have an ungodly amount of health for a fixture, so better make sure you actually hit them","February 21, 2015","false","0.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","7","13","0","0"

But Ground Zero is outright bad at times, unlike DoE. The uninspired level design and tedious encounters (particularly with the new enemies) make for a frustrating experience. When you enter a room and are immediately killed because you failed to account for two rocket turrets behind you while fighting off 3 gunners, it's hard not to feel cheated by the game. Ground Zero is unfairly difficult, and what I mean by that is that it isn't challenging in a fun way. DOOM and Quake are challenging in fun ways. You keep dying, but you keep loading that save again to get back in it. I can't say the same for Ground Zero.\n\nI recommend that you play another game of the time period or replay Quake II, because Ground Zero is just monotonous.

At least The Reckoning waited to put the boring mobs that take 15 shots to kill on the last levels. And, unlike The Reckoning, this has a lot more to do with random luck than skill.\n\nSentry turrets are everywhere, take 3 rockets each to kill, and shoot with damn-near perfect timing the second any part of your body becomes visible. The sight is still WAY OFF, which makes aiming with the sight even harder than without it. Spider droids can't be stunned and fire in almost random locations. If you get hit, -25 health. No matter how full your health or how skilled you are, run into the two mobs who totally randomly decide to fire with perfect aim and you're dead. Have fun saving on a near-constant basis, even on medium difficulty.\n\nOn top of it, there are plenty of droids that take too many shots to kill, so goodbye ammo and hello tedium. Add that some can even rezz the others while you're taking said 15 shots at them, and I start to get REALLY bored. And it's not like they're bosses so they're well-scripted and interesting; they're just normal mobs that take 15 shots to kill. It adds up and just becomes pure tedium.\n\nThe new mobs and guns are interesting, so it's a shame they made the game stupidly tedious and randomized. No tactics or skill will help.\n\nIt's almost like you have to exploit the bugs in the code to win, which is stupid and completely takes you out of the fact that you're fighting evil cyborgs. I don't need to prove that I'm good at a 20-year-old game, so just forget this P.o.S.\nWhat a waste of time.","March 14","false","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No\nWorth revisiting? No, definitely worth a playthrough but not memorable enough for a second\n\nBest part – More Quake II, if you like Quake II this is more of the same but with the usual expansion pack extras. i.e. more weapons, enemies, levels etc\nWorst part – Doesn't really have a standout moment, making this quite forgettable. Still, you'll easily get your monies worth.","April 17","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
