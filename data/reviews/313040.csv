The artstyle is decent enough, even if they got lazy and couldn't be bothered to create clouds and other background art in the voxel style, but everything else is awful. The controls are loose and sloppy, creating an unsatisfying feeling to the gameplay. The level-design is near non-existant, where about half of every level is just flat ground with an object for you to jump over here and there. Sometimes there would be some platforms for you to jump between, but then it was back to flat ground again for a while. Maybe that gets better as you go, but I played the first two worlds and only a couple of semi-interesting things happened.\n\nThe bosses were terrible, mechanically uninspired and boring too. The regular enemies are also irritating, because they randomly shoot at you if you get close. There's no rhyme or reason to their shooting and the bullets move so fast that dodging them intelligently is nigh impossible. You just have to keep jumping while slamming the fire button and hope you don't get hit. It's like Contra if Contra was crap.\n\nOn top of all this, it seems fairly low on content. As you may notice, I've only played 10 minutes and that was two worlds out of five or six. I even died and had to continue once, yet I still beat 1/5th of the game in 10 minutes! Basically, this game seems like it's an hour long. Maybe two. I'm not planning to find out.\n\nAt this point, I'm also going to point out that every level ends with a box popping up asking you if you want to keep playing or take this time to review their game. After every level. Could this game be a lazier mobile port?\n\nThat's not even to mention the obnoxious music. Oh, man, the music. It's going to hauntingly echo through my dreams for eternity. It sounds sort of like Teletubbies music, or something similar that your toddler cousin might adore. If you're older than 10, though, you will be muting this game if you decide to play it. The constant plop-plop-plop sound of your gun doesn't help.\n\nIn fact, the above is true for the whole game. If you have a four year old at home, they might get some enjoyment out of this game. It's simplistic, easy and obnoxious. Sounds perfect for a toddler! As an adult, I slogged through a few levels and couldn't deal with it anymore. When I fell through a glitched platform twice in a row, I quit out and uninstalled it.","July 21, 2014","false","0.2"," 121 of 157 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","121","157","0","0"

One, this game has no apparant autosave feature after each level to hold your progress.  Another problem that is very annoying is the SHIFT key being used in this game to shoot.  Requiring your pinky to access the shift while walking and jumping was a serious mistake on the developers part and leaves the player with a huge disadvantage!  The levels can feel very repetitive as to each character being spammed in the world ever few feet from the character and it has no exact story line (Not saying all games have one or need one but this one sure could have had a storyline to make it better)!  You could say this game is very choppy and the enemy mob variety is very scarce.  The game is very short and honestly needs retouched.  This game can leave you raging because you can't make any progress and it very stubby with the key.  To add, it needs an options menu to bind shooting with a better key.","October 5, 2014","false","0.7"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Each stage has about 5 levels which is basically the same things and enemies over and over. Some of the moving platforms change the way your character moves so when you jump from platform to platform there will be a sudden gravity change. The first weapon is a wrist destroyer unless you wait to see an enemy before shooting, in which case they'll just hit you before your bullet hits them.

Even at this low price I don't think it's good value. But if you don't care about that you might like to give it a try for a laugh (a BIT of a laugh lol). Update: I tried playing through a bit more, I just found it hard to keep going. To be honest it is a pretty bland game. I quit when I got up to a bit were you have to jump between 2 enemies and it was impossible to avoid taking damage. I died and it was my last life after countless deaths trying to complete the same level...\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Wxqxw9b0rOg\nSurprisingly to actually move your character and stuff it feels okay, it's fluid your character doesn't doesn't become static when you attack and that sort of thing. On first booting up the I found games sound track and short story explanation amusing. It's actually a hard to avoid some enemy projectiles because of the their unpredictability and lack of fine control over your character. I found a good tactic is to just spam your weapon before enemy even scroll onto the screen. But that's a pretty lame way to play and the weapon noise would annoying. Truthfully I only played for 10 minutes or so, so far. But I've completed the first of 5 worlds in what felt like 5 minutes. At that rate it would take only 25 minutes to complete this game. Even at this low price it may not be good value for money. Also the music became pretty repetitive and it seemed to only be a short loop. Obviously that can become annoying. And lastly the weapon that you unlocked after the boss fight was only different from the first weapon in that it fired a different coloured projectile. That was kind of lame lol","July 17, 2014","false","1.3"," 44 of 93 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","44","93","0","8"

I believe that the rest of the game will handle pretty much the same mechanics as the first 3 levels.\n\nI am in a position where I can't continue the ice world because is really hard, and I don't have enough meats to continue.\n\nI will enlist what is good and bad about the game.\n\nPros.\n. The art is pretty, is well balanced.\n. The idea of small squares as part of the art is really attractive.\n. When an enemy hits you, you lose part of your body. That's great.\n. The levels are long enough to have a good progression.\n\nCons.\n. Starts with 500 meat? What is it for?\n. Oh, the meat is to continue in the game when your lives are finished.\n. Oh, you have to purchase meat to continue in the game.\n. I tried to buy meat but stayed in "loading"\n. I can't see any difference between the two first weapons.\n. You have to play with the new weapon gained in order to succeed the next level.\n. Using dynamite in an icy floor is kinda mission impossible.\n. Between loads, there is a text I can't read; it appears too fast.\n. The enemies are just... soulless.\n. Most of the enemies are designed to hit you, no matter your strategy to avoid them.\n. Where are the checkpoints?\n. The load position of the character after you die is sometimes frustrating. Is far from the place you died.\n. Please, no "rate us"\n\nIs a game with potential. Is not better than good platformers out there, but the game has deep flaws in the game design department.\n\nI recommend you to learn from this mistakes and use focus groups or beta testing before releasing another game.","June 16, 2015","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/theWatchingShadow/recommended/313040/","theWatchingShadow","The Watching Shadow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/theWatchingShadow/","3745 products in account","First things first, I noticed I picked this game up back in Sept 2014 (yeah, finally bothered to finish it Dec 2015) when it was $4.99.  I got it for $0.99 due to a 80% discount and I see it's currently priced at $1.99.  I wish I had gotten this for less than a dollar, honestly.\n\nSo...the whole point of this little game is a hunter's guns are stolen by various, er, animals (?) and he wants to get them back.  You start off with a single shot (semi-automatic? :P) gun that is fired by pressing the shift key.  Like a few other reviews state, you need to turn off sticky keys or else you'll have, um, issues.  The game itself is rather short overall as it has only 5 main levels.  Each level/world has 3 stages to it and each stage has a couple checkpoints.  Sounds straightforward right?  Well, your "points" if you want to call it that are pieces of meat you collect while killing the various animals and 100 pieces of meat = 1 continue after you lose your 3 lives...and boy did I need them in some places.\n\nThe first level (a forest) is waaay too simple as it's nothing but move right, spam shift, kill things, get meat, and get to the boss (after the 3 stages).  From there you get a new gun (rapid fire by holding shift instead of spamming it).  Each main area gets progressively more...involved I guess with a bunch of awkward platforming to deal with.  I had more game overs (and time accumulated) that I was wanting because of some jumps were just really awkward to deal with.  Oh, and before I forget on a game over you have 3 choices - continue (using 100 meat to restart at current checkpoint), restart (at the beginning of the current stage), or main menu (to start at the 1st stage of a different level).  Yeah..you don't collect meat all that fast unless you bother to go back to a different level and farm meat (I didn't).\n\nI will say that I enjoyed the music in the game.  The last level (a beach level) had music that REALLY reminded me of the ship theme from Final Fantasy 1 (NES heh).  The music on the main menu was rather cute too so yeah, the music was good in this one.\n\nThe voxel based graphics was an interesting take I will admit.  I guess it has a certain charm to it instead of actual pixel platformers (decided pixel being in the title).  A couple levels had a few...gimmicks towards the end of the last stage that were amusing to do once but annoying to have to do over and over and over...as they were right before the boss. -.-;  With the frustration had in the game though, the ending was rather...unstatisfying.  Oh well...\n\nSo, if you like platformers (with guns) you MAY want to give it a try but ONLY if you can get it for less than a dollar (maybe 50 cents?).  It had a few fun moments but going to have say NOT recommended unless you get it for cheap and just want to waste a bit of time with it.","December 8, 2015","false","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
