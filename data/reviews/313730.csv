Most of the game is text supported by frozen snapshots showing mostly girls in uniform. The story itself is massive but shallow regarding plot and excution. Gameplay distributes into a)reading b)selecting a path c)unit progress d)combat\n\na) reading (story)\nLet me say that my younger self (a former anime geek) would ve been absolutely THRILLED if this would have been available in my time. It has everything a young male teenager would want.....girls, mecha, me being the hero, nudity, big boobs. Several decades later my mature self remembers how this feels but I cannot ignore the holes and unrealistic behaviour as well as technological improbabilities. Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius is nothing more then a fairy tale in space. How any of the main characters would end up in their positions (captain, commander, fighter pilots) keeping the childish views and behaviour is beyond me....still....its amusing if only for its nostalgic value and I cannot help but wonder if the hero will "get" the girl :) It took me about 2 days to play through and even tho I would rate this "book" a 4/10 it was entertaining and easy to read...nothing to wrap your head around but then....its free so theres nothing to complain about really.\n\nb) selecting a path\nThe first couple hours start promising. After the tutorial mission you are presented with a galaxy chart offering different systems you can visit. Many places dont open up before you talk to various crewmembers. Theres a hint of side-missions which would enable farming and a distraction but in reality the available content is extremely limited and becomes non-existant after a few hours when all you do is to follow the main story. All in all the game "tries" to present multiple paths but in reality its as linear as it can get.\n\nc) unit progress\nYou start out with your flagship and collect Ryders (mecha) throughout the story. Each unit is represented with its own arsenal and abilities (support, assault, anti-capital, anti-mecha) and statistics providing numerical values in combat. Kills in combat provide a bounty which goes into your treasury as well as command points which are pooled for extra actions during battle. You improve unit stats by allocating funds to certain areas with each improvement becoming more expensive. This system gives you the opportunity to "specilaize" your units but money is extremely tight with no means to generate "extra" income (like repeating missions or an "open" environment which enables you to farm) you are dependant on getting optimal results in battles (re-playing them until you get it right) and a good "build" (dont waste money on upgrades you dont really need). Enemy units also become more powerfull and battles are always stacked against you. This can be extremely frustrating and forced me to take breaks in between to regenerate my motivation.\n\nd) combat\nTurn-based, hexagonal battle map with 2-shot battle animations. The combat system WANTS to look intimidating and complex but it fails as strengths and weaknesses are obvious and easy to exploit. Defensive play tops offensive in almost every skirmish and important command decisions are out of your hand as they are woven into the story so you are left with mop-ups or survival scenarios while the critical things (warp out of harms way, fire a torpedo down the death stars chute.......errrrr....I mean fire your main cannon directily into the enemies flagship planet destroyer nozzle) are displayed in text form. Combat eventually becomes repetitive, boring and also annoying where I find myself wanting to be done with it in order to continue the story.\n\n\n\nSunrider: Mask of Arcadius is advertised as an anime novel and thats what it is. Gameplay is extremely limited as everything centers around the story which takes you by the hand and forces you into a "tunnel" to avoid any problems and distractions. I found myself flipping through the pages (clicking space) and reading the dialoges only to groan in annoyance whenever a combat came up. All you do really is click through available NPCs (order doesnt matter much) in order to relive memories and see how the story evolves. As far as I can see there is ZERO replay-value without multiple endings and maybe 2 or 3 side missions in the whole "game".\n\n\nNow this might read like a crushing review but to be honest....its not that bad :)\n\nFirst of all its FREE so what do you lose except time? The story itself is typical anime with a single male hero surrounded by young girls of various character (shy, dominant, offensive, rule-loving, unsecure, horny). You follow this crew to observe how they bond, their inner thoughts and how they try to find their place in the world. Everything is tailored to obeying orders, doing the right thing and fullfilling/finding a greater destiny. The universe is threatened by an "evil" opponent and you represent the only force of "good" with forces around you which you are unsure about (is the Alliance a force of good or out after after their own goals?). Mecha-design and exotic weapons appeal to the inner geek and the scarcly clad anime girls (young, boobs, uniform, colorfull hair, anime eyes) are what the typcial hormone-driven male kid craves (well...I did when I was young /grin) and THEY ARE ALL INTO YOU.\n\nYep....among the "hero saves universe" story theres enough left to observe how you run after your old love while being harassed and stalked by every other female in the game.\n\nCharacters are well drawn (the female ones.....the males......yech) but its all frozen snapshots. You get TWO erotic ones in case thats important to you (probably a quota thing).\n\n\n\nIts not much of a game but its entertaining. All in all I would rate it a 6/10","October 13, 2014","true","7.2"," 211 of 228 people (93%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","93","211","228","18","6"

Basically a sort-of X-Com with anime girls. Huh.\n\nI had serious misgivings about installing this one, even though it was a free game. First impressions made it look like the sort of bad waifu VN I would feel ashamed playing, but it was a free game with high reviews. At least if it sucked I wouldn't have had to spend any money. So I decided to try it.\n\nTurns out... it's actually quite good.\n\nYes it does have a number of immature anime things, and even playing the regular (censored) version of this there were more than a few suggestive moments and some very brief nudity. And yet all of this is set against a rather dark and serious backdrop: galactic warfare and all the horrible things that come with that. It gets particularly psychological and tense later on as your character ends up with nightmares about stuff that happens in the plot that comes back to haunt him in a PTSD sort of way. I'm not going to say more than that because spoilers, but all you really need to know is that the story kept me interested. And, during several moments, coming away fairly impressed by what these indie devs had done.\n\nIn short... don't judge this by its cover. There is much more here than a bunch of silly anime girls.\n\nAs for the characters, it's pretty good with a few bad eggs. It's pretty much a full roster of all the anime girl archetypes you can think of: the overserious workaholic (Ava), the genki girl (Asaga), the shy genius (Chigara), the tsundere (Icari), the massive pervert (Claude), the kuudere/Rei clone (Sola), and the trusty idealistic soldier (Kryska). But all of them stand out in their own ways, even if not all of those ways are positive (Claude is basically a pervert fanservice doctor and nothing else). There is a sizeable male cast, believe it or not, and some of them are actually interesting (Admiral Grey, Fontana) even if others (Arcadius) just seem like stereotypes.\n\nGameplay makes this a mix of VN decision-making (some of which are rather difficult and made me take some time to think about), tactical battles, and some management stuff as you upgrade equipment or do side-missions. The battles can be tough, sometimes absurdly so, but there's nothing technically wrong with them. There was one moment that annoyed me a bit concerning a story mission where I knew exactly what the enemy was planning, and yet I was not able to act on that knowledge because the story needed to convince me that this particular enemy was smart or something when, if this had been a strategy game, I would have torn him apart. At least the hair-raising scene after that battle ("Let me show you war") was worth it, and led to probably my most morally questionable decision I made in my playthrough.\n\nTruthfully I found myself more interested in the story than the battles, and kinda wished I could skip them a few times because other things were going on that I was more interested in. At least in Key/Visual Arts' VN Little Busters! you got an option to skip the Baseball and Battle Ranking minigames if you wanted (but why would you? The Battle Ranking stuff was great! XD).\n\nAt time of writing, this game isn't finished. There's still more story being written so I can't really make an absolute recommendation on this because of that. But based on what I have seen so far, this game has real promise. :D","May 10, 2015","true","18.7"," 116 of 121 people (96%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","96","116","121","7","0"

This game is for the VN officionado who is looking for a little something "more".  Sunrider offers difficult, gripping decisions that will test your willpower.  Primarily, who will be my waifu!?  There is a host of female characters for you to douse your loneliness with and they go beyond the typical harem tropes.  You know, the tsundere, the tomboy, the A-Cup Angst, the cute girl with no emotion except that one time when she opened up but is still oblivious to the world around her, the insecure bashful one, the one who WANTS YOU NOW, the super peppy one, and so on.\n\nWhile these tropes are in the game the fact that you rely on them in battle helps give them personality.  Each of your potential waifus pilots a ryder (essentially a gundam) and you have to build their stats appropriately to fit them into your battle scheme.  That's where the fun of this game is.  The combat in the game is great!  I found a lot of fun in building my ryders and testing their metal in glorious combat.\n\nBut being a commander in charge of the fate of the universe is stressful.  That's why all successful star commanders know that you can't save the universe without a host of females to support you.  A man is as only as good as his choice in romance options!  But, alas, with so many waifu's and so little sexual stamina that's just one more obstacle for you to overcome.\n\nThis game doesn't hold your hand, but your potential waifu will.","November 2, 2014","true","11.5"," 104 of 113 people (92%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","92","104","113","36","2"

Well, if you think this is just another of those lousy and cheesy anime game. You are wrong. Believe me, you are wrong. This is a tactics game, if you ever play Final Fantasy Tactics or Agarest: Generation of War, it is that type of game.\n\nThe gameplay mechanic is very fun i might say, you can upgrade your ship or your mecha crew, like you want to make it stronger, or deals much more damage. The thing that you can upgrade is a lot. The battle mechanic is simple but fun, basically you got multiple skill and type of attack, like long range beam attack, gun attack, laser attack, rocket, and you need to use the right type of attack at the right type of the enemy, if for example you are facing the cruiser with alot of armor, you cannot just use the gun attack because the gun attack deal less damage against the enemy with alot of armor, or if your enemy is a light mecha, you can't use a long range beam attack against them since they be able to dodge it easily.\n\nOutside of the combat, you got some Mass Effect ish kinda interaction in your ship, you talked to your crew try to get to know them. The story is very good, i might say it is like Mass Effect in the way that there's some choice that seems right, but when you choose it some innocent people die because of it. The Lore is deep also, i don't think there's good or bad here, It just politics.\n\nSoo, well its free. From the quality alone this game is very good that is on par with the game that cost 15 dollars. But it is free.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackmesaboy/recommended/313730/","blackmesaboy","That Explains Everything!!!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/blackmesaboy/","201 products in account","Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius is one of those games where you can definitely feel the love and care that went into its creation. The game's studio, Love In Space, have worked on a few titles all revolving around the same universe (same people different situation) but this is my first taste of their work. I have not finished the game but I can say I am very impressed.\n\nThe game is similiar to other hexagonal grid turn-based RPGs but with a visual novel twist. It's not quite a dating simulator and not quite a "choose your own adventure".\n\nYou play as Kayto Shields, recently promoted to command of your very own advanced warship named the Sunrider. The galaxy finds itself at war with the evil space communists and it's up to you, the good guys, to stop their evil plans! ok, so the plot is a lot more complex than that but to avoid spoilers I'll just leave it at that.\n\nThe game handles combat in a fairly traditional way. It's not a technical marvel by any stretch of the imagination with effects simply being layered over the image onscreen. What it lacks in flashiness it makes up for in character....characters.... The game takes your standard grid combat system and has you spend action points to move and shoot your enemies to oblivion with certain units having special attack and support abilities. The heart of your strength is the Sunrider itself but you also get a fleet of space mechs that you deploy at the start of every combat into whatever formation you desire. This is where the previously mentioned "character(s)" comes into play.\n\nOn your journey you manage to build up what many familiar with anime and dating sims will immediately recognize as your "space harem". These lovely ladies accompany you on your journey and lend their aid as fighters, medics, support craft, etc, and greatly benefit you when it comes to dealing out the whoopass. Thier personalities range from shy, goofy, stoic, serious, etc. Now while this is probably sounding a lot like a dating sim with some combat sprinkled in I will report, to either your delight or annoyance, that this game does not turn into one big tail chase. There are romances that develope over the course of the story but everything plays forth in a fairly straightforward manner. You do encounter several big decisions to make in your travels but since I have only gone through certain choices I cannot say if they redically alter the story or the crew's feelings for you.\n\nAfter combat you receive funds based on the enemies destyroyed and how much damage you have taken. You then spend this currency at your R&R depertment upgrading shields and weapons. You can also stock up on special components and powerful limited-use weapons from a special shop. Overall the system works really well and you really feel a sense of progression as you see your meager fighting force become something to think twice about. Not that the enemy is going to do much second guessing as some stages turn brutal really fast. One moment you're mopping up the floor with enemy fighters and the next they're warping in space carriers and battleships. These guys don't mess around either. Positioning is everything and enemies can quickly overwhelm you. Multiple saves are a must as one bad decision can lead to death fast. Thankfully the game features multiple difficulty levels and you can even play on a mode so easy you just have to go through the motions and victory is assured.\n\nThe amount of work that went into this game shows and like I mentioned earlier this really is a labor of love. The game features an opening straight out of a game from Japan (with authentic Japanese vocals from an eroge singer) and very pleasant artwork. The characters are fully voiced during combat and this is really where the character shines through. While the voice acting is decent the lines the characters say during a fight are really charming and reflect the personality types well. Want to hear a quirky anime girl shout, "Imma firing my lazers!!!"? Play Sunrider.\n\nI really have to mention the soundtrack which is very well done. It fits the tone of the game very well and even after multiple battles I still have yet to tire of it. The music that plays when you issue your super laser command especially gets my blood pumping.\n\nTo wrap this review up I have to mention the price. If you havne't noticed already the game is FREE. FREEEEE. You really don't even need to read this review. If you think it looks cool from the images and the description sounds cool then download it. The game loads super fast and is easy to pick up and play.\n\nBefore I end I will mention this game is only PART 1. The next part is releasing soon (as far as I know. Check their website) and should be available on Steam. It sounds like you will have to pay for the next game but this first part alone is about 20 hours of gameplay alone so have fun! I enjoyed it so much I downloaded their full-on dating sim spinoff game Sunrider Academy. Definitely a recomendation if you like the characters and want to see them all in a HS setting......and naked......if you're into that sort of thing. Both games have a restoration patch from the Love In Space website to restore censored content (not sure what was cut from Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius since it's pretty tame so far).","November 3, 2015","true","15.5"," 57 of 60 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","57","60","4","0"

The good thing is the first two episodes of Sunrider is completely free, I don't know about the next episodes, though. By the time I wrote this review, Sunrider still on the 2nd episode.\n\nHonestly I'm here only for the story, which is good. And I think next episodes there will be Dating Sim feature.

It's also quite buggy (loading while in battle sometimes crash the game and I once lost the save I was loading upon a crash)\nSecond the menu aren't really intuitive (you can't close it by pressing "Escape" !) and they're sometimes laggy as well.\nThird, I won't blame the game for this because it is free but I'll still mention that the dialogs aren't voiced at all, which was really hard on me\nOkay with this done, let's see why I still think that it is a good game.\n\nPositive points\nLet's start with the story ( I won't spoil anything here ), it might seem a bit cliché and there are some part I disliked because of that, but overall this is rather well written, funny at times, serious at times, sometimes sad and touching and hell even heroic at times, there's definitely a "Japanese touch" (or whatever you call this) to it too\nAbout the characters and their development now, you'll have plenty of occasions to talk to them and I must admit that the character cast is quite likeable, it's rare for me to not have some characters I dislike in a visual novel.\n\nAt first the characters seem quite simple but you'll learn more about them by playing and in my opinion they're all quite interesting, have their secrets, had their hardships and all have their reasons to help you fight the PACT. (The protagonist is also totally amazing, Kayto forever)\nMusic is a really important point for me and it's totally good in Sunrider, which helped me holding against the fact that the dialogs weren't voiced.\nArt might seem a little cheap during the first hours but then I became used to it and ended up liking it actually, sure it's not like all these Japanese visual novels but again the game is free.\nAnd I'll end by something I really enjoyed, the fights (not even the lags and bugs stopped me from enjoying it !). I'm a big fan of tactical RPG and played an awful lot of them and still I found the fighting in this game really interesting, I played in the highest difficulty and had to die and retry TONS of times (and I have around 2000 saves too).\n\nYou'll see how it is by yourself if you play the game, I'll just describe what I found really great.\n\nThere's a lot of customization, you can upgrade tons of things on your different ships but everything cost money and you have only very little of it, just as I like it you'll need to carefully examine this and choose precisely how to upgrade your ships, you won't be able to upgrade everything at all and there's even a shop when you can buy one-time use items that might save your ♥♥♥ but costs money too ... So you better spend it well !\n\nThen there's the fact that the gameplay is continually becoming deeper, for a good part of the game every three fights or so you'll unlock something that will make you change your strategy and things will keep getting spicy with more powerful enemies and worst situations every time.\n\nFinally I think that the difficulty is very well balanced, there are multiple levels of difficulty that will allow you to only play for the story or to also play for the fights (or you could even select this "Space whale" difficulty that will please all M guys like me that enjoys to suffer eternally).\nOf course I’ll advise you to play for the fights too with the captain or hard difficulty since the fighting is great and a huge part of the plot revolve about you being a captain and thus leading fights … (and man that feeling when you beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of them !)\n\nI'll also confirm that the "Space whale" difficulty is beatable without cheating (because it is said that it wasn't tested by the dev when you select it)\n\nLastly, I can't really comment on the length of the game since I spent 95% of my time reloading saves to hit that ship with 5% percent chance ...","July 9, 2015","true","0.3"," 57 of 64 people (89%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","89","57","64","11","2"

All of your potential to create success in the missions begins with how you spend your cash, so spend wisely and plan your upgrades around what you want your team to accomplish.\n\nOnce you enter the fray, you'll find a tactical battle system that is, in a word, challenging. At normal (or "Captain") difficulty, even as a 25 year veteran of strategic and tactical gaming, there were several missions that had me pulling my hair out as my comrades were annihilated one after another by the unrelenting tide of foes. But that made the satisfaction of eventually conquering those missions all the higher, and if you want a more casual experience or are only playing for the story, don't let the battles frighten you. Many easier levels of difficulty are available, including one that makes the battles a mere formality so that you can get on with the story.\n\nAnd you'll want to get on with the story, as it is surprisingly deep and exists in a beautiful area of moral uncertainty that few games tackle as successfully. There are choices to make that will leave you feeling like Sunrider isn't just a game; in a game, the hero should always be able to do the obvious right things, save every princess, and slay every dragon. But in Sunrider, you may have to choose between the princess and the kingdom, knowing you can never rescue both. You may even be surprised to realize that the dragon isn't necessarily the villain. In that sense, Sunrider recalls the best moments of morally ambiguous visual novels like G-Senjou no Maou. It will make you question the nature of good and evil.\n\nThe obviously limited budget and tiny development crew would be easy to cite as drawbacks, but in my view they benefit Sunrider enormously. I can imagine many ways that throwing better graphics or higher production values at the game would just detract from its tactical and storytelling heart. The simple anime-style artwork serves its purpose and effectively connects the player to the mostly-likeable characters. If there's anything negative to say, it would be that the voice work of the combat lines doesn't add much to the game given the high amounts of repetition. I would have instead preferred to see voicework in the actual dialogue segments between fights.\n\nIt comes down to this: If you have ever had space in your heart (no pun intended) for story driven tactical strategy, play this game. You won't be disappointed, and it will cost you nothing but a little of your time.\n\nOr a lot of your time.","October 30, 2014","true","30.1"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","40","42","2","0"

I was impressed with the quality of the music and sounds. The art is crisper than it appears in the videos, but I was still a bit disappointed in the minimal animation. The game is story driven so you will find yourself clicking through a lot of exposition between stages. The story doesn't do it for me personally but some might enjoy it more.. far it seems pretty linear, we'll see how much they let your choices affect dispositions/outcomes by the end. The strategy is not incredibly complex but provides some casual fun with a fair amount of choices via upgrades system. There are three levels of difficulty though I don't know how they scale yet. Unfortunately it's a purely single player experience, but definitely worth a play.\n\nOne big gripe I have is that I wish they would change is to make the unit-select work by clicking on the whole tile rather than the unit outlines. It's very easy to misclick and it makes the interface feel sticky. The deck select seems needlessly complex as well-- Same with cutscenes for every attack, although I do appreciate that you can click through them.\n\nmore strategy reviews @ CardStrat\nsteamcommunity.com/groups/cardstrat","July 9, 2014","true","1.7"," 66 of 87 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","66","87","0","1"

To the best of my knowledge, no choice can lead you to a failure state (save through choices made in the combat layer); instead, choices decide what kind of a captain you want to be, and to act contrary to built-up ideals at some critical points is harder than to continue to play your beliefs straight (represented by the offering of the other option at a small cost of in-game command points).\n\nThe writing and dialogue isn't really award worthy, but it's certainly playable. I'd even call it better than average for a VN, and the occasional moments where things really come together more than make up for any bland parts.\n\nThe Gameplay\nThe real meat of the game is its combat. Battles are challenging and rewarding at Captain, one of the six difficulty levels, and different tactical approaches offer different levels of risk and reward on scales from the immediate to the long-term. Much of this is accomplished through the surprisingly deep upgrade system. While there aren't any trees to climb or alternate ships to swap your pilots into, there's plenty of stats to focus on and their synergies can stretch beyond the immediately apparent. Play well, and you'll have enough money to invest in some pretty niche strategies.\n\nThe Characters\nThe game's character work is about on par with its plot work, but it has the benefit of being fleshed out passively as a consequence of the combat. Even if you're not a big fan of the fairly unadventurous tropes many of the characters are built around, you may find it hard to stay mad when they're jamming half the enemy fleet's targeting for you, or sniping missile boats from accross the map. I know I did.\n\nThe in-combat voice clips got on my nerves at first, but they over time they grew on me, and I wound up pretty happy with them as the rampant devestation they heralded increased in scope and range. Not that you can't turn them off; if there's one thing Sunrider isn't wanting for, it's options.\n\nBugs/Issues\nThe game has recieved balance and bugfix reports after release, and it's pretty well rounded. There remain one or two potential crashes related to the combat layer; about once in two hours I would guess, you may hit a script bug that quits you to desktop. However, the game has a very robust auto-save system, and a crash will set you back a few seconds at most.\n\nSummary\nThis game is fun, good looking, free, and dare I say it: well made. Why not pick it up and see if you like it? You've little to lose except a bit of time, and if it grabs you enough to take that from you, wouldn't you say it's earned its price?\n\nIf does take your fancy, consider throwing a bit of coin at the developers' site. There's no requests for donations or cheap monitization gimmicks in the game, and if the money doesn't go straight to rewarding the devs for their good work, it'll most likely go towards designing more quality games.","November 15, 2014","true","13.9"," 35 of 39 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","35","39","0","0"

I followed it for a while, eventually downloading the demo. Though nowhere near as refined as it currently is, the combat and the story drew me in, and made me want more. It wasn't a hard decision to back it, in the end, and I haven't regretted it since.\n\nEach of the characters have tropes and cliches making up their general personalities, However, that's not all there is to them. They each have life and depth, which, in my opinion, makes it worth fighting through even the toughest battle, just to see what happens with each of them next.\n\nAnd believe me, the battles will be tough. Love in Space designed Sunrider to be a very difficult game, in which you always feel as if you're just about to be overwhelmed. I think they have succeeded at this, as I certainly never feel completely at ease during battle.\n\nStill, there are different difficulty levels, if it's too much for you. I don't mind admiting that I switch to Easy on occasion, myself. However, if you're one of those people that finds "nearly being overwhelmed constantly" too easy, there's always the Hard difficulty, which is sure to blow you out of the proverbial water. There's also Visual Novel difficulty, which is good for testing out strategies, or just speeding through the game, if you simply can't wait to get back to the story.\n\nThe plot itself is interesting, though if you're a big fan of the genre, you've likely seen the basic idea before. Still, having seen Love in Space's past works, and some of the bigger twists in Sunrider, I can safely say that, by the end, you'll be shocked at where this story goes.\n\nIf you're not sure about Visual Novels, Strategy RPGs, or both, I'd like to remind you that the game is free, and not going anywhere. You can try it out at any time, for no cost, so just think it over for a while. If you ever get bored and have nothing better to do, Sunrider might be the right thing to pass the time. And who knows; you might just end up liking it.","July 10, 2014","true","4.8"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

Here's why:\n\n(I'm about half way through the game, I think)\n\nOverview: The game is divided in two modes; visual novel and hex rts space fleet engagements.\n\nThe visual novel is basically you getting to enjoy and even interact in a very competent anime story with yes, all the typical things like a Tsundere, bashful loli, sexy nympho etc, but also done in a very thoughtful way with very good story telling and good art.\n\nThe rts portion is simply awesome. You get to command a kick ♥♥♥ capital ship and several mechs with their own abilities and pilots, earning money to buy upgrades between missions and at intervals throughout the game more things become available such as eventually building your own FLEET. You heard me, as in command allies to make up a battle group...(EPIC)\n\nHere's a breakdown of my personal rankings for this game by category:\n\nArt: 8/10 It is well done, crisp, and detailed. You can tell it was on a budget, but also a labor of love.\n\nSound: 8/10 Sound effects are sometimes a bit repetitive, but overall good quality.\n\nMusic: 9/10 Music plays reacting to what you do, how the battle goes, and what happens in the story. Excellent music on it's own as well.\n\nVoice Acting: 9/10 The voice acting is superb, 9/10 because the game would have benefited from more varied character lines during battle scenes that can get repetitive, and the Captain's Iconic "FIRE!!!" during the Vanguard Cannon attack (Super Yamato Cannon kind of thing) is a very unexcited "fire.".\n\nStory: 9/10 While not perfect, the story is engaging, well written, exciting and full of expected and unexpected twists, but all of them are satisfying, even if you're able to see them coming.\n\nGameplay: 10/10 The gameplay is highly satisfying, much more than what you'd expect for a game like this, there are multiple levels to the gameplay mechanics, and rpg elements like special skill system, levelling up skills, abilities, items and buying allies will blow you away.\n\nOverall Quality: 09/10 By this I mean the structure of the game, saving, ease of menu navigation, audio/video options etc. The only thing missing is an option to disable screen shake when someone takes damage during battle scenes. Well done indeed.\n\nVerdict: 10/10\n\nYes, the scores themselves don't add up to a perfect 10, but when you consider that this game is an addictive, superbly made gem that delivers on way more than the standard VN (I usually NEVER play Visual Novels) and the last, but not least most important factor of it being ABSOLUTELY FREE when I would have happily paid at least 10$ for it, this game is a real special treat, and I hope that the creator(s) make much more for us to enjoy in the future.\n\nI'm very happy I stumbled onto this gem and will happily tell all my friends about it. It deserves all the support it can get!","December 30, 2014","true","24.6"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","29","33","2","0"

Going in, I didn't expect too much. It's a free indie game funded via kickstarter, and while it made several times the asking amount, fifty grand or so still isn't a lot of money to make a game with. Particularly a game that's basically two genres in one: A turn based strategy game and a visual novel all at once. You can tell its production values aren't as high as bigger titles; the artwork is sprite based, and it uses ren'py as its engine. It has none of the stunning 3d visuals big ticket titles boast.\n\nBut somehow everything fell into place, producing a game that's surprisingly deep and compelling and, most importantly, fun.\n\nThe game basically has two types of gameplay - there's a strategy portion where you command space battleships and smaller attack mecha called "ryders" on a hex-based field, going by turns, and a visual novel portion where you interact with a cast of quirky characters and trade funds acquired by blowing up enemy ships in exchange for upgrades to your ships.\n\nThe strategy segment reminds me of Master of Orion 2, or possibly some of the really old SSI goldbox titles; its basic mechanics are simple enough to figure out quickly, but mastering how it works takes longer. Each unit has 'energy', which can be used to move, shoot, or use abilities, similar to the concept of "time units" in the old XCOM games. Ships have a variety of weapons from missiles to lasers and gauss guns, all effective against different defense types, and oftentimes have special abilities to give them even more utility when it comes to potential strategies. There's a ton of potential tactical options here, and that's not even taking into account special strategic options, such as a giant cruiser-wrecking beam cannon or fleetwide boosts to damage or defense that you can also use.\n\nOne thing particularly notable about this half of the game is the sound design. The music gets you pumped, the guns feel meaty when they fire or hit something, and the character voiceovers when you attack or are attacked generally go a long way towards immersing you in the game. I felt excited whenever I heard Ava telling me that we'd just hit a distant target on an improbable shot, and I especially liked how reactions differ depending on the state of your units - the character VOs get progressively more panicked as their unit gets closer to destruction.\n\nAs far as difficulty goes, the game is challenging even on easier difficulties in some battles, and there's a wide range of difficulty options ranging from easyish to "so hard the devs haven't verified that it's actually beatable."\n\nThe art design for the units is low detail - it's all sprite based, but it's all very self-consistent and has a strong visual style; each faction's ships look like they belong in that faction, and you can usually tell what they are and what they do at a glance.\n\nThe visual novel portion of the game is... Interesting. Unlike a lot of VNs, the main character - the one who gets the most development - is the player character. Indeed, I haven't even found any of the genre-staple routes. If they're there, they're very subtle. It really comes across as Captain Shields' story, more than the story of a particular heroine like most VNs.\n\nEspecially since there's two basic philosophies in play that help shape the character - when decisions come up, they're typically either a matter of pragmatism or idealism. For example, early on there's a choice of whether to strike a vital enemy communications relay while its defense fleet is resupplying, or stop a fleet of pirates from trafficking slaves, and it is these types of choices that help establish the Captain's personality and behavior.\n\nOn my first playthrough I ended up mostly idealistic with a slight bit of pragmatism as the war got darker and more desperate, and so Captain Shields was palpably suffering and growing disillusioned from the contradictions involved.\n\nThe overall plot is somewhat basic but servicable thus far - it has some themes in common with Muv-luv, especially when it comes to the impact of fighting on people, but it also echoed the disillusionment of the Iraq war in the second half. While I haven't read a VN with a story quite like this before, it doesn't have any huge unexpected plot twists until the very end. To be fair to the story, I didn't see that twist coming; I thought it would be something different based on the hints so far, and that's good writing since it caught me by surprise.\n\nMechanically, the story has the right level of tension, and at all points you *feel* like you're outnumbered and outgunned and only winning battles through tactical genius. My only real complaint is that at one point the villains had the heroes dead to rights but didn't kill them. (Granted they'd just gotten what they wanted, but still.)\n\nI say thus far because the story isn't complete as of this review. The content available now ends on an abrupt cliffhanger with a "coming soon, episode 3!" taunting me. Still, what's there is meaty enough to sink my teeth into, and if the writing quality holds up to the end, it should end up being really interesting. Especially if some of the plot points foreshadowed early on come into play.\n\nThat being said, there are some anime cliches present, seemingly for levity's sake. So if you have a low tolerance for such things (for instance, there's a "beach episode" in between major military campaigns), Sunrider might not be for you. I didn't mind it soo much because the cute cliches helped lighten the mood; without some light stuff, the story would have rapidly gotten too dark.\n\nBut any VN is carried by its characters more than its plot. Initially, Sunrider's characters read as stock archetypes more than characters (shy waif Chigara, cold Rei-type Sola, tsundere Icari, etc), with personalities dominated by a core trait. I wasn't impressed; at first I came back mainly for the tactical gameplay and resolved to ignore the VN half of the game.\n\nHowever, as they get more development over the course of the game, they grow into fully fledged characters in their own right. Sola isn't just a cardboard cutout with no personality, she has hopes and dreams that set her apart from the typical "cold asocial pale girl." Asaga in particular started off as my least favorite character and grew to become one of my favorites, simply because of how she developed over the course of the story.\n\nGenerally, all the characters grow beyond their stock type quickly enough for me to forgive their beginnings.\n\nThough not plot or character related per se, there's a surprisingly rich background setting here, one with a vaguely mythic/fantasy-esque quality. Learning why almost all the characters are women, for example, was surprisingly plausible and interesting, even if it was just a single throwaway line there to establish setting background. Still, I'm impressed that the writer thought of details like that.\n\nOverall, Sunrider is a surprisingly good game. It's not perfect. The character art is a bit too flat outside the CGs, and the background material that's there now leaves me wanting more. The art for the units, while strong stylistically, still doesn't have huge amounts of detail. It's not going to drop your jaw in the same way an AAA game's art might. Its plot is somewhat predictable up till the end, and its characters start as archetypes more than characters per se.\n\nBut it soon grows beyond those shortcomings. The characters grow into their own, the gameplay is fun, and the story is entertaining even if you can mostly see its general flow ahead of time. And the sound design is generally very strong.\n\nFor a free game, it's very good. So good that I wouldn't mind spending actual money on it.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes, definitely. I found it charming. The fact that it's free merely makes it even easier to like.","November 23, 2014","true","12.7"," 23 of 23 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","23","23","0","0"

So, that is definitely something to keep in mind when determining whether or not this is something you would like to play.\n\nFirst of all, this is a genuinely free-to-play game. There is no catch, thanks to the successful Kickstarter. This means that there are no micro-transactions or other payments required to play - although I for one, am also financially supporting the Developers with other purchases. The plot is interesting though not necessarily spectacular. But the world is quite interesting - then again, I am always hugely interested in the lore and background of games, sometimes more than the game itself... The game has some pretty solid dialogue as well, including some incredibly funny lines. The post-credits and bonus scenes are also quite amusing. :D\n\nThe standard visual novel fare is present, with conversation options and topics and a variety of characters and a pretty interesting world to get involved in and learn about. But then Sunrider makes a sharp turn here, integrating mechs and turn-based strategy... quite well, actually. I'm nostagically reminded of games like Super Robot Wars on the GBA... a good thing, for me at least - I love those old turn-based strategy GBA games - and this includes most of the good parts of those games!\n\nAnd it's not like the turn-based strategic combat is just tacked on for the heck of it - it can be quite fun and engaging too, though this wouldn't necessarily be the hardest turn-based strategy game around. There are a range of difficulty settings, from the extremely easy "Visual Novel" mode (where you deal more damage and take less) to the very challenging "Hard" (which is actually... quite hard, unlike certain other games where Hard... is actually not that Hard). It is also here where the voice actresses make their appearance in this game (and not, as some may think, in the Visual Novel section of the game), speaking out when their Ryder (mech) is selected, performs an action, or is attacked. The sound effects are also quite well done. But the soundtrack is truly spectacular, fitting in well with the narrative and being quite emotive. This is not just limited to the OST, but the songs, such as Sora no Senritsu, are also worth listening to.\n\nI am a bit sad that there is no multiplayer option, but the single player experience remains very good. I really love co-op, though that doesn't integrate well into games like this, and PvP doesn't really seem suitable. Destroying enemies gives you money, which you use to upgrade the abilities and stats of both the Sunrider (the capital ship your character is the captain of) and the Ryders that it carries (belonging to the female pilots on your ship). I am somewhat disappointed that you are not allowed greater flexibility in customisation, such as the ability to change parts, modules and weapons from Ryder to Ryder, but the upgrade system is not too bad.\n\nUPDATE: I'm very happy with the second episodic release: Mask of Arcadius. Expanding and continuing off from where First Arrival left off, the new Opening is great, with a very "anime-esque" feel - the cinematic and the credits all lend themselves well, alongside the visuals (some of which, once again, are NSFW). I also like the fact that the choices you make have consequences - the writing is surprisingly good and impactful.","September 8, 2014","true","50.5"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","22"

Yep, there are plenty of those carried around by the helpful female cast of the game.\n\nSeriously though Sunrider: First Arrival is a combination of a visual novel and a grid-based, turn-based combat...in space! Yeah! Everyone loves space combat, and if you don't, there's plenty of boobs to carry you along. The game is obviously for you if you are into both genres (especially considering the game is being distributed at the low low price of free), while I can still see fans of either genre enjoying the game's other half.\n\nI am somewhat at a disadvantage here for having almost 0 experience with visual novels (the only thing I know about them is that they come in boobed and non-boobed variants, and the female characters featured, when lined up, display a vast array of hair color envying even rainbows featured in the proudest of gay pride parades). Being unable to tell you how the visual novel experience holds up compared to other visual novels out there, but I can at least tell you that it is functional, for a harem-ish (I assume) with a vast array of female characters archetypes to interact with.\n\nUnfortunately, for players like me, who are drawn in purely to command space fleets and not the promise of boobs (okay, maybe a little bit of boobs too), the game revolves more on its VN experience than its tactical space combats, and those combats only serve to bridge and progress storylines, and act as a means for you to get those cuties to start talking stuff. While the amount of units and their upgrades are for surely not lacking, the overall experience suffered as it had to share its space with the VN part. Still, I'm not complaining here, I got some fun hours out of it (especially if you, like the filthy, brainless peasant I am, drop the difficulty all the way to the lowest and casually mop the space floor with hostile super battleships and carriers and the like in-between rooting for your potential waifu(s))\n\nOverall, considering its price (free), I'd say it's worth a try so long as you are not overly allergic to VNs.","July 10, 2014","true","12.5"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","2"

This review is for both episodes. *\n\nMost visual novels are either novel in a visual form (usually with voice acting) or present very basic player interaction (such as games developed by Telltale, and Dontnod's "Life is Strange"). Sunrider, while a visual novel, is also a game.\n\nMany people who recommended this game to me have called Sunrider the Dark Souls of turn-based strategy games and they are absolutely right. Simple missteps in combat could cost you the battle and forcing you to return to a previous save point. The traditional leveling progression is replaced with a stat management system for all of your characters outside of battle. Unfortunately, you have limited resources to upgrade your characters, forcing you to make tough, long-term decisions on how you wish to build your party.\n\nSunrider's story and characters are definitely the highlight of this game. The universe is well developed and leaves enough areas for growth in future installments. Battles that our characters engage have an effect on the universe and every death feels heavy. Love in Space tries to avoid most character tropes that plague anime and JRPGs and for the most part succeeds; giving each character a personality and having them develop over the course of the game. There are a few cliché moments, but those are by far in the minority.\n\nSunrider is everything you want in a visual novel: likable characters, a believable setting, and a plot that you just can't get enough of. Sunrider is a Kickstater done right.\n\n\nMy summary of Episode One: First Arrival and Episode Two: Mask of Arcadius:\nPros:\n- A well-developed universe with lots of potential for growth in future installments\n- A captivating story filled with political intrigue\n- Decisions that have you question whether you made the right choice (though not leading to a branching narrative, though this may change in Sunrider's sequel/next episode)\n- Likeable characters\n- A relatable protagonist (VERY RARE FOR A VISUAL NOVEL!!)\n- Complex stat management\n- Fun tactical turn-based combat\n- A decent soundtrack\n- Good artwork, character models, and CGI backgrounds\n- Dialogue and decisions can be rewinded using the mouse wheel (no need for multiple saves to see what consequences your choices will have)\n- FREE :D\n\nCons:\n- Anything higher than "Easy Mode Difficulty" is extremely difficult\n- Difficulty scales by having the AI throwing more enemy units on the field rather than introducing greater enemy variety\n- Game would have benefited from having a voice cast as characters in this game are also present throughout the Sunrider universe (which includes Sunrider Academy and the upcoming Sunrider Liberation Day)\n- One very frustrating escort mission that occurs mid-way through the first episode","July 3, 2015","true","12.2"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","20","23","2","0"

Now that that's out of the way, overall I cannot find much to drag this game down. It is excellent on so many levels. The stratagy portion is rather good. The story is great in my opinion and it contains so much room for more development and by that I mean what has already been released could be developed even further. The choices are rather interesting and I do really want to see how they impact the story because of the possible effects. The Ryders remind me of Armored Core (which was a series that I loved) in their design and weapons (design and weapons mostly reminding me of Armored Core 4 and Armored Core For Answer). Plus if it keeps the function of virtually unlimited saves I will definitely think its a plus. Also the developer deserves kudos for making such an excellent Visual Novel by far. I am not normally a fan of OELVN (Original English Language Visual Novel) but this one defintely has me excited. Not so sure if I like the "casual" uniform of the female crew members that are not Ava or the Alliance lieutenent (whose name I can't remember and whom I think should get a different uniform because she isn't part of Cera's military) wear, it's just too school uniform like for a warship and makes me think that school plays into the VN somehow. But that isn't enough to drag down my opinion of it that badly, just some graphic style complaints. Overall something that should at least be tried by everyone, besides it's free so go ahead and try it.","July 15, 2014","true","29.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","2"

Technically, it's half VN/half turn-based tactics. This was a big point as I figured the most similar game I've played previously was Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance. Between that and my familiarity with the Phoenix Wright games, I figured I was prepared for the type of story I was going to get.\n\nI was not prepared.\n\nMaybe my first clue should have been the all female cast on the promo screen, or the characters alternating between school girl outfits (on a battleship?) and Evangelion-style jumpsuits. I quickly realized I'm probably sufficiently older than the target demographic for this game.\n\nYou play as the last good guy in the universe, apparently. Every other male character onscreen is the enemy, or at least kept arms-distance away from the plot. You DO get to interact with many young women, several of whom are pining for you to some degree. I was expecting Phoenix Wright and instead got Fate/Stay Night. There should be a distinction for Visual Romance Novel, because it's about as self-serving. Oh and there's space politics.\n\nTo be fair, the dialogue does discuss plot elements of some moral ambiguity, and does give reasonable choices in the same regard. Though since I haven't finished the game I don't know how those choices play out. The overarching story has a lot in common with the aforementioned Fire Emblem game (remnants of a conquered land seek to stop the invading army from unlocking an ancient power by requesting the aid of the other superpower, and there's a princess) but is played here with more nuance. The benefit of VN format, I guess.\n\nThe tactics maps are the top reason I keep playing. They are challenging without feeling unbalanced on the default setting. The music's pretty awesome, too.\n\nOverall, this game is pretty middle-of-the-road. It didn't persuade me to the VN genre, and doesn't offer enough that I could recommend it to someone who doesn't already seek it out. I don't think it's bad, it's just not for me.","October 20, 2014","false","8.4"," 103 of 171 people (60%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","60","103","171","4","9"

Pervert (very funny girl xD) and Loli (one thats more annoying then cute)\n\nPartial voiced in English that is pretty good and not ear grating (like almost every hentai that was english dubbed)\n\nEasy to understand combat system (note projectile weapons such as nuke and missles can be shot down by flak so dont believe that 100% hit ratio all the time unless you take down thier flak that is)\n\n10/10 would buy it if they asked for money (which they wont the game is free and will remain the same with the future installments)\n\nOnly draw back is it's not fully complete it's a 3 part game and atm the first 2 have been added and in the near future we should see part 3.\n\nLong Answer:\nSunrider: First Arrival has by far surprised me I've been waiting for games like Little Busters and Kanon to get licensed to steam but when I came across this I did not expect to not only get a visual novel but one that comes with tactical RPG gameplay and fanservice. (uncensored in some cases so be carefull if you play this at work then again the sticky note says 17+) It really reminds me of Muv Luv and Baldr Force in terms of Visual Novel but what makes it more interesting is that its voiced partially in english thats not to the point that it grates my ears like most dubbed Hentais. I was also surpised to find out that it wasnt made in Japan so +1 to the developers on this game for not only attempting to make a game but for making it free as well. So you must be asking should I play this game? Is it worth my time? Well if you like playing visual novels or eroge for that matter I really reccomend giving this game a chance also this game is free and from researching it looks like future chapters will still remain free (sorry its not the full game only a small part of it) so I really suggest it. Lastly the gameplay is pretty fun and simple to understand just something I want to note is when you are shooting missles or nukes beware enemys do come with flak which means they are able to shoot some missles if not all of them down so its just something to note that their 100% hit rate doesnt really apply to those types of weapons. The best way to counter that is you get an engineer pretty early in the game I say for the 3rd or 4th battle her name is chigara Ashada I believe that is able to hack in and turn off their flak guns however its for the ships you choose so other enemy ally ships could also shoot them down if they are near the target you are shooting at. In closing I really have to say this despite the game being free if they were to sell this game not saying that they will I would totally buy it.\n\nAdditional Info:\n\nGood news.

Gosh, was I fooled.\n\nThis game is in dire need of optimization and further patches - it can chug worse than a Prius trying to haul a mobile home. The UI doesn't register your clicks sometimes, and the save / load screen could use some work as well. The battles can be 'Nintendo Hard' to the point where if you don't optimize your ships a certain way, you will not survive.\n\nBut, it is FREE - and for some great space battle thrills, and a hard hitting story - Sunrider has definately earned the hours that I've poured into this game. The usual anime tropes and character archetypes show up here, right down to hearing 'I'm not doing this because I like you' in the middle of a firefight, and not only that - but a few raunchy scenes make their way into this release. Thankfully, while at the end of the day this is still a japanese style VN - the game isn't overloaded with these moments, and doesn't seek to be a hentai.\n\nThe story combines perfectly with the fighting, almost every mission feels like a fight for your life while being hunted by a fleet far superior to your single capital ship, and a few brave allies in their 'Ryders'.\n\nBy the time I saved the Agamemnon, I felt like a hero with a cause.\n\nTl;dr\n\nFOR YOU IF:\n\n- You have a fondness for grid based space battle games (ex: Super Robot Taisen Series)\n- You enjoy japanese style visual novel series backed up by decent characters, a great story, and deep music\n\nNOT FOR YOU IF:\n\n- You are phobic towards the usual anime tropes verging on the NC-17 level\n- You hate hard games and you are too stubborn to use the difficulty settings","October 30, 2014","true","23.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

The Story itself kinda reminds me of mass effect and Gundam Seed, but the Robots are called "Ryders", and the fact that you don't have to go into that many suicide missions to build an army. The story is very serious at the beginning, then it becomes rather funny, like the moment with meeting new Crew members.

The story is full of surprises, and I ususally see everything coming form 5 thousand parsecs away. There was not a single second that I felt like this would be the most predictable story after the first turn of events.\n\nThe Amazing Stretch\nGoing where no man has gone before\nThe creator/writer Samu-kun went the extra mile and added something very risky into the story and game. Inside the lore he added a race that would be considered OP, and most writers do not DARE to touch on that subject. As a screenwriter (and writer) myself, I have been told not to for reasons like, "Everything has to have a weakness" and "It would be nothing but a bunch of spoild people running around with no real sense of danger."\n\nAdding this into a game and story is the best thing I have ever scene since writing, and it's not just for one single moment where the, "wise people teach us an important lession about humanity", there is evidence of this race of super humans throughout the game, and it just gets better and better.\n\nIf there is one thing to absolutely love about this game, it is how far he stretched the boundries of traditional writing, and successfully incorperating it into the game.\n\nCopyrights? HA!\n\nThe Creator has given us, EVERYONE, the ability to use these characters, story, backgrounds, etc. free use to place wherever you want, as long as you don't place a name on it OR sell it. It is ment to be completely free for everyone! They did an amazing job with that, and I hope that other companies follow in this since it is a great idea to allow people to let their creative ideas flow.\n\nThe Good:\nStory\nThe story is everything you expect and more with twists, turns, and the occasional shocker. There isn't a single time when\n\nStrategy\nThese battles can be very long and challengeing, causing you to think up strategy like none other. It goes outside the realm of regular strategy, and you RALLY have to think outside the box.\n\nVoice Acting\nThere is voice acting but ONLY for battles. Its pretty good, and they hired a decently known name to the gig, so you should recognize her voice when you hear it.\n\nCharacters\nThey have almost every anime typical character personality in this game. There is a Yandere, Tusndere, Dandere, Gneki, Loli, Kuudere, Nadeshiko, Childhood friend, and...Pervert. Yes, a female pervert.\n\nThe Bad:\nWriting\nA few pieces of dialogue aren't written all too well. Its a bit cringworthy and could be rewritten. It almost takes you out of the story zone and back into the real world when you read it, somewhat ruining the immersion of the story.\n\nVoice Acting\nIt would be nice if the VA went throughout the project, but they are giving this game for free, and don't have the money to do so.\n\nCharacters\nThis can be seen as a problem for some, so if you don't like what I mentioned above, then you mgiht not like the girls.\n\nUpgrading\nAt the start of the game, this can be very difficult since there isn't really much to choose between for upgrades. The cash you have is limited, and upgrades get very expensive after the 3rd upgrade. Only after the battle mentioned below does the cash you get start to increase and become useful, so it can be hard to stick to this game once you reach that point.\n\nAgamemnon Escort\nOne of the battles is absolutely ridiculous. Its gonna take a lot of turns to win it on Normal alone, and its almost better to choose a bad path in the story than the good one. Yes, I told you the name of the ship because I think it's fair to warn you all how terrible that battle can be.\n\nBUT...\n\nThe Mods:\n\nThis game is 100% moddable. So even if you don't like the way things to, you can always just change the code, or download code through the forums or one of my links on my page (or workshop if they allow you to add it). I will be making a Neko and a -mimi mod for all the characters, so be sure to look out for that one. (^_^)\n\nIn All:\nThis game will not disapoint. And if it does, there are many many many mods to fix that (^_^). I am sure that a lot of fanfic mods will come out, people with their own artwork and own characters to place into the game to change the story and make it ever evolving, the story doesn't have to end once you finish one part of it since there are sure to be many others.\n\nI personally believe that this could even be used as a gateway VN for people who don't know much of the VN scene or have a bias towards it. If you have a friend who likes Turn-based strategy games or Sci-fi games, you might be able to convert them to this game type.\n\nAlso, it goes to say that if you know someone who hates the sci-fi genre (like I hate the High Fantasy/Midevil Genre), and they have played games like Agarest: Generations of War or Agarest: Zero, then this game might be able to convert them into a sci-fi fan as well.\n\nThis is a completely free game that you can do anything you want with. You can change the story, modify the characters, increase your ship power, and even add you're own arwork into the game.\n\nThis is the best idea ever, and I would recomend this game to everyone for the amount of freedom they allow.","July 10, 2014","true","17.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","6"

I am glad to say that the LIS team has made some thing really special here. Its not without its flaws but this is an excellent sign for the quality of this series in particular and western VNs in general. Helps that its also a damn good turn based strategy game as well.\n\nIf I had to nitpick, the main antagonist, whom I refer to as Char on heroin, is overblown to the point of absurd humor even considering the classic mecha anime tone of the game's story. Where most of the characters are pretty well written I think he kind of stands out as a blatant and rather unamusing charactiture. The voice acting, which only exists in battle segments much like the confirmations of RTS units, is also hit and miss. Depends on your tolerance for US anime-dub quality voice work. Some voices are far better than others.\n\nThe plot overall is entertaining, most characters are likable. The battles are actually very demanding, Ive heard of many people being forced to turn down the difficulty later on. I happen to like the mecha design, very reminiscent of Armored Core in many ways. The music is stunning, a highlight of the game. I found the character art a mixed bag, though nothing is so bad as to be distracting. There are severe frame rate issues in battles, but I am told this is being worked on and its not like TBS games require twitch reflexes anyway.\n\nOverall highly recommended. If you like VNs, this is a promising story to follow. If you like TBS games there is a damn good one under the hood here, and maybe you can broaden your horizons with the VN elements.\n\nOh yeah, and it's free. Now we wait for the Space Whale DLC I keep hearing about.\n\nREVIEW UPDATE FOR MASK OF ARCADIUS:\n\nStarting off, I have a lot of great things to say about this second part of three, but first the bad. There are a number of memory leaks and other crashes in the new gameplay segments. I am sure these will be patched but I reccomend caution and liberal saving.\n\nNow then, the good stuff. The game is challenging as ever, introducing new unit types to further ruin your day, like support mechs with debuffs and curses. This is a good thing, disregard the forum whining. Story is still engaging, with a lot of improvement in the characterization of Captain Shields and nice moments for the whole cast, even the antagonists.\n\nOh, and Char on Heroin is still hard to take seriously, so it's nice that the other two antagonists pick up his slack on the depth and likability department.\n\nFrame Rate issues are still present, but massively improved from initial release. I still find this game running on open source VN software to be something of a miracle.\n\nSo yeah, heartily reccomend this second part of the game. I am actually anxious to see the third. Maybe we shall see one of those damn space whales, at last.","July 14, 2014","true","20.1"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","4"

I suggest playing in Novel Mode or Easy the first time around, because it's harder than it appears. You also need to save as much CP as you can early on, because the last two missions have a ton of enemies that you need to get rid of quick in order to progress.\n\nOne big problem I had with the battle system is that (in my opinion) the ratio between enemy kills and how much it costs to upgrade wasn't very even. Even if you kill alot of enemies, repair costs at the end can take away a huge chunk of the profits and the number of turns you take in battle also determines the amount of CP you get. So you end up blitzing through battles to complete the mission as fast as possible each time, which nets alot of CP for the Vanguard Cannon and Drones, but you can potentially miss out on alot of money.\n\nThe costly upgrade rates between the Sunrider and the Ryders, plus the necessity of buying missiles means you'll barely be upgrading anything through your playthrough and spending most of them on restocking missiles. The best upgrades I found when playing were increased missile stock for the Sunrider and HP upgrades for everything, since those were cheap. Upgrading anything else such as weapon damage/accuracy/energy, flak and armor were too costly to be effective. Later on in the game you also have to pay to use Repair Drones instead of having them for just 750 CP, and that further depleted the already finite money I had even more. Even at the end of the game I was barely scraping by with barely enough money to afford missiles and could not afford to upgrade anything as the battles just got harder.\n\nBesides the problems I had with the actual battle system and strategy, for a Free English VN this is very very good. It's definitely worth playing and the story is pretty interesting. The VA's are pretty good too; better than what you'd expect for an English VN.\n\nIt needs more Icari scenes though. The amount of Icari scenes compared to everyone else made me kinda sad. There were a couple times during the game when you could talk to every Ryder pilot, but Icari wasn't around when I needed her. I'm not sure if it was because of the choices I made in the game or not when getting Icari, but it made me sad when no option to talk to her popped up.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game, but start off on Novel Mode or Easy for the first time around so you don't get bogged down in one battle for several hours like I did. Enjoy the story first and foremost before anything else. There was only one doable sidequest in the game, and I'd like to have a few more so players could bolster their resources for later game.\n\ntl;dr version: It's like Galaxy Angel meets Advance Wars meets Valkyria Chronicles. It's good.","July 11, 2014","true","23.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

While the gameplay works in the small-scale, when it attempts to have larger scale battles later on, it fails.  This is largely due to the ubiquitous use of missiles, which are extremely long-range, extremely accurate attacks meant to be rare and used sparingly.  However, in the later stages, the enemy spawns infinite reinforcements each with 4 or 5 missiles.  There is a stage in particular that is just boring and infuriating, because the moment you end your first turn, you WILL lose at least one unit to a barrage of more than a dozen missiles.  And unlike other attack animations, you cannot skip the missile's travel animation, leading to a wait of upto 10 seconds for each missile.  Having timed it, a turn for the enemies on a certain stage, skipping as many animations as possible, took two full minutes of sitting there watching missiles zoom across the screen.\n\nFinally, the code needs polish. A lot of polish.  I am running an i7 processor and a GTX780, with plenty of RAM and an SSD, there is no reason for this performance.  In large battles, the animations become extremely choppy, and this happens when playing for extended periods as well. This also causes complete animation failures, and UI glitches, such as missiles never appearing, units not visibly moving, the commands menu disappearing, accuracy rates being displayed incorrectly or not being displayed at all, and unit buffs not being displayed.  While the game never crashed, it performed so poorly that when combined with these other issues just made the experience completely irredeemable.\n\nTo address the massive amount of attack spam, and long wait times between turns, a friend of mine has created a helpful guide to turn off animations. Manually.

The turned based battles.  The option to upgrade both the Sunrider and the ryder's seperately.  There are also so visual novel type choices, decisions to make which I haven't determined if one choice really effects the story over another choice yet, but I am assuming the path of the story takes a slight detour if not an entire new ending.\n\nI like that there are a lot of strategic decisions to make on the battlefield, such as which weapon to use on which enemy, how far to move in any one turn, when to use a special power, or even if to in certain battles, as that takes up energy that you don't get back until you earn more.\n\nDifferent battles also have different objectives.  Some are eliminate enemy, others are protect certain ships, etc.\n\nI do find it funny that two of the ryder pilots are dressed in almost the exact same looking pilot outfits, and look almost exactly like, even down to the exact same hairstyle, as two of the Evangelion pilots in the anime Neon Genesis Evangelion.  Gee, wonder were the makers of Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius got their charater ideas from.  =D\n\nIn short, I have been playing this for a few hours now and am still enjoying it.  Have failed one battle objective 3 times now, but I keep coming back to try different tactics.  I reccommend this game for those who are looking for a good anime, turned based strategy game.  Aren't to many of those being made for the PC now.\n\nGame developers now just want to make retro, 8 bit games, point and click adventure crap, or RPG eye candy that is more movie and battle animations than gameplay, where you need the latest and greatest video card to handle the animation and CG.\n\nFor those that would like to get back to real strategy gaming, with anime and some story thrown in, I definately recommend this game.","March 2, 2015","true","15.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Nothing aids a shopping spree quite like the word FREE, and along with a few other Sekai Project works, this one found its way into my library and I started it just a few weeks back.\n\nLet me tell you, having just finished the second episode, I am bouncing around the room with excitement!\n\nAt first, the sprite-based artwork didn't appeal to me much, but after some time they begin to grow on you. This also applies to the characters. At first it seemed like each was just fulfilling their role as a walking anime stereotype, with examples including the hyperactive girl, the quiet genius, the tsundere, the stickler for the rules and some others. But soon enough I was joining in with all their little speeches in-combat and was genuinely interested in how their character would grow. This game also breaks from the traditional in that it really feels like your mission is the liberation of the galaxy, rather than just choosing the options that will lead you to your desired girl of choice. The game doubles up genres and gives you a turn-based strategy as well, which came as a welcome treat for me.\n\nThe music in this game was solid from the start. Each tune perfectly matches the surroundings and really immerses you in what's going on at the time. I remember the first time I used the Vanguard Cannon ability, and the change in music was nothing short of overwhelming. You can imagine members of your crew cheering with every victory gained.\n\nThe moral side of the choice-making is very clear. Generally it's between the right thing to do and fulfilling the mission, which always leads to debates about who you are as a person, but thank goodness for multiple save files! You can try any and every possible option and still feel like you haven't quite lost your humanity.\n\nIn terms of cons, the only noticeable one is that sometimes in combat missions the game will crash and force you to quit, but other than quickly restarting, this doesn't set you back very far as the saving system is usually on the ball.\n\nOverall, I give a 9/10 for amazing music, brilliant last-minute plot twists, the strategy elements, and of course, the Vanguard cannon.\nDamn, I love that cannon","May 9, 2015","true","157.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

I thought, "Whith graphics like these, what is it doing on Steam?" (My idea of visual novels on Steam wasn't the most favorable one) That was then. I inquired further and read some reviews. Some were good, bad, witty, and so on. I saw the trailer and sat there, amazed; I was sold. It was the music that made me believe that this was a worthwhile investment of my time. I also saw the implementation of the turn-based strategy on a hex map -- as if I could be convinced further that this game was worth it.\n\nI was happy to play an unremarkable visual novel that had a decent story simply because of the music, but I soon learned that this was no such thing. This visual novel blew my expectations so high that it makes a nuke look like a mere toy.\n\nBreaking it down:\n-Music: 10/10\n-Story: 9/10\n-Gamepley: 9/10 Very addicting -- difficulty settings are perfect to fit players's skills.\n-Fanservice: 6/10 If you play this game for fanservice, you will not be disappointed, but don't expect too much; it has few moments and they are vastly spaced out.\n-Re-playability: Good. I will most likely play this game over a couple of times to see more of the story from other points of view. I also wanna try to play on the highest difficulty... God rest my soul.\n\nTo reiterate, if you like VNs where you command the freaking best ship, SS Challenge All Odds, into battle while getting yourself a harem of waifus - look no further.","August 4, 2015","true","6.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Story & characters are likeable and the girls are drawn very decently.\nMechs look cool as well. Too bad I can't say the same about the males in this game - it does show the character drawer specialises in women. Men look like wusses, thankfully they don't show quite as commonly (perhaps that's why, who knows..). Visuals all around are nice!\n\nAs for music and voice acting - I like it very much. Sound FX are quite good in this game.\n\nNow for the tactical gameplay - at the time I am writing this, this game suffers greatly from how imbalanced it is. I stared playing on "Captain" mode, which is what the game suggested at the beginning. Why not? I finished Sengoku Rance not once, but multiple times - I thought myself being more than prepared. Now, all was well until the battle of Far Port - I did beat it eventually, but dear lord was it hard!\n\nReading the forums I see people saying "Captain is easy, I don't have much trouble on Hard" - well, that is utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The game arbitrarily scales down your hit/defend ration, and scales up the opponents. Now, this isn't bad in itself. But they did it in the style of XCom - E.Uknown. It's utterly unfair for the player. But hey, games should not be fair right? They should be challenging! I dig that, but now the game is sadistically hard, based mostly (from my experience) on luck. You can have the best strategy, try to tactically engage etc. - you will get crushed anyway unless the goddess of RNG smiles upon you. And yes - I am not new to strategy games and if you say it was easy for you - please PM me the video of how you did it, cause based on my experience and the people's on the forums - you're just a troll.\n\nMaybe I will beat this game on the 'default' difficulty some day.. but the amount of frustration this brings isn't being overcamed by satisfaction when winning a mission.\n\nNow for the adult part - so far I've seen Asaga's breasts once when she was under the shower.. Maybe I made some wrong choices or didn't focus on 1 character enough. But this really seems lacking.. I mean Katawa Shoujo made a much much better job at that.\n\nSummary: Overall I like the game, what it wishes to be. I like the characters. I dig the battle system, but at this stage it's imbalanced and frustrating. Visuals and voice/sound/music are really nice. If only the battle system was better thought out - challenging, but not frustrating (on the default difficulty!). Lets hope the devs keep tweaking!","November 16, 2014","true","36.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","8","10","3","0"

For first: it is a free game. One of few games funded on kickstarter that is not a scam to take your money. A true testament of people who really want to be independent devs. It is also a good scifi tactical rpg/visual novel hybrid. Of course limitations of renpy engine can be seen and game relly demands a strong PC, despite it's apperiance.\n\nSpecial notice for soundtrack and sound effects. For a game with low budget, that was realesed free of charge, it stands on top level.\n\nTo all of you on kickstarter devs. Take a hint from this game. It was made right on time and devs don't demanded more money for it, than they get through crowdfunding. THIS IS HOW YOU DO THIS.

(freely available on game files Steam\SteamApps\common\Sunrider\game\Music)\n+ In-depth storyline.\n+ So many girls around. Oh wait...\n\nCons:\n- Inconclusive story. A part of trilogy, anyway, but still....\n- Mediocre battle mechanic.\n- Engine is so unoptimized. How come I'm getting low FPS in 2D battle!!! for a Visual Novel genre?\n\nIf you've ever played XCOM, Front Mission or Final Fantasy Tactics, this is similar. A hexagonal turn based strategy game wrapped in Visual Novel genre.\n\nThe battle mechanic is too simple for my taste, but understandably since this is not intended as full-blown strategy game like XCOM. You control some basic Ryders alongside the mother ship, and along with the storyline you'll be sent to battle menu to arrange team into the 'board' with variety of objectives depending on where you are on the story. There are some pre-planning involved, as in don't put Sora on the front of the enemies as her Ryder is weak, yet deadly when sniping from afar, or put your Mother Ship in the middle of the battle. Mostly the objectives would be to wipe out the entire opposing team, but sometimes you have to escort someone to safety.\n\nThe quest system is there, fairly promising but falls short. After certain points of the game, you'll be given a world map, where you can pick where you go. There you can work on quests that when you complete it, you'll receive rewards. The game maybe was initially designed  to be offering multiple paths to progress with this quest system that you can manually pick, but then again it does not give any real impact since the ending stays the same. Moreso, the game gives you multiple choices to pick to reply in many situations, but again, nothing's changed significantly except the one near the end of the game.\n\nThe most amusing part is for me about the story - and how the characters interact with each others especially Kaito to Ava (given their notable past - close relationship). I would have hoped the developers could deliver more story about each characters' background, though, especially Sora. That said, I find the game has some in-depth lores, and you have to pay a bit of attention so as not to miss anything and be clueless later.\n\nAnd lastly, I find the game performance is pretty horrible. Ranging from constant crashes that forced me to reload from last save (god knows I've done that how many times) and truly poor controller support (who on earth wouldn't like to play VN genre while laying comfortably on the bed?). So yeah, save often and don't count on that quick save feature. Don't forget to save on multiple files, you'll understand why when you see the save menu.\n\nHowever, I could find nothing but a resounding yes to question 'is the game worth playing?'. If you love Visual Novel, definitely give this a try.","February 22, 2015","true","28.7"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","9","12","3","0"

I like everything and thats just me :D  well it really just depends im like that >.> you might see me hating something that most would agree is better than this but thats just me~\n\nYeah  nice and not too long...... ok its short XD  , the combat can get boring since the missles erghhhhhh(thats all PACT does , dam Russians XD)  but yeah its guuudddd has some funny momments and some very unique characters. some might be just generic as hell >.> im talking to that tsundere one.Theres even a lolicon for all you lolicon lovers, shes one the bad side ~:o makes it all better .Theres that shy one and the loud one and the soldier girl :D .But the best one that character from Neon genisis Evangelion , its Reii :O!!! but with white hair . The story really is the strong point here and things can escalate very quickly x3     yesh theres also that bathroom bit where your man character justs some manages to go in with someone there ( I think cause i had to skip that XD  it was like a normal convo with you assistant , one click then BOOBs and i was playing with a child in the room as was likeee shhhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee D: but yeah good times) i skipped all the dialouge there at first  T-T my story was going so well , I did reload just for it XD\nThis game is Free  and i would have problems if you had to pay for this (its just a tad too short but hey they promised more. im surprised they updated this to help with the missles XD meaning these guys are devoted and thats just awesome ;D\ni nearly made 5 hours but i sure as hell had fun , you can increase the difficulty but yeah you will be there for a long time .\nI would play the next one when it is out , i wish this goes reallllllyyyyy farrrrrrr\n8/10 story   (There might be things i missed XD  you can make choices which alters your play) I  have yet to exlpore all :o\n9/10 music (will change for those wacky moments and yes i loved the hell out of it when i was fighting them pact buggers and i dont know if this would bother you but when you end your turn  of course the music changes to pact but it starts again so you dont really get the whole feel, i kinda wish it was consitant and changed one the track ending )\n6/10 combat i liked it at first but later on i just wanted more~ it sometimes became impossible to win D: at times  it can  be bloodly hard DX , but this feature is new for them and i can see how each unit is unqiue in combat abilities and with improvement this could be very fun .\n\n\nFor the Second game im still playing it but heres what i think so far:\nBloody amazing  everything is better,will touch on that soon but for now all i can say is things are getting really heavy now and for the firts time you actually feel like your in a war unlike the first chapter (This train has no brakes , youre in the ♥♥♥♥ and must make some serious choices very quickly , dont know if they do anything lol not done palying yet)\nHalf way :\nRight ive played far into it and its envery thing i like frim the first chapter but much more better, for now enemies also have magic and new voices, i wuv dem voices. we get flashbacks and more drama as the war escalates but i dont want to reveal the story here since this is the middle bit of the story as a whole. game time has now increased 7 more hours (depending on what mode your in) and the New enemies and imrpovements to combat is exaclty what this game needed, you have to plan your attack much more and you placing your units at the start into formations alsoo plays a key role, the new units provide harder gameplay as they can now shut you down and hack your systems too.\n10/10 story: yea i love the story now, i am a blind follower and i shall buy all the merchandise the website sells.(just one small bit, i know he misses his sister but the PARENTS! D:? were they ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s or something, i mean its liek his sister was the only one who mattered. suppose thats another japanese thing to the game but whateve :D\n9/10 music: Same product and it should be, dont touch this >:o\n8/10 combat:  still long in some parts and i understand the CGi used and the explosions(Hell if they were any better we might have to pay for this game)\n\n\n\n\n\nHelp Ava!!!!

When I first seen this game I was sceptic, but since it was free to download I thought why not give it a go? I’m glad I did.\n\nIf I had to describe this game in two words it would be amazingly addictive. Out of all the games I’ve played over the past few years, this is without a doubt one of the best. It’s easy to pick up and challenging.\n\nIt’s a turn based strategy game set in the future. A bit like Gundam Wing, politics included. The storyline is second to none and the soundtrack compliments the game well, not to mention there are some good plot twists (even I didn’t see coming). You also get to make your own choices which make it a bit more personal and keep you involved. The Characters have interesting backstories and questionable personalises (in a good way). There is some adult humour involved (mostly with Doctor Claude Triello) but other than that it’s toned down innocently.\n\nI’m really looking forward to hearing more about this game and playing more. It would be nice if they continued it like the Mass Effect Series or even made a TV show. I would happily pay for Sunrider. The good news? it’s a free game so download and give it a try you won’t regret it.\n\nAll for one and one for all (Asaga Oakrun)\n\nMarks out of ten?

I played The Last Of Us on the hardest difficulty and that one wasn't too bad. Just annoying sometimes. Starcraft 2 Brutal? fun fun hard.  This game hard? = Oh. 5th-10th try on this map again? damn it all.\n\nPerhaps it's my strategies(or lack thereof) when fighting the enemy. But every few maps instead of trying to beat it on hard mode after the X,XX number of times. I'll get frustrated and go into cheat mode aka Story Mode (cuz hey it is a visual novel too!)\n\nBUT despite beating a few maps in Story Mode, thus earning almost the Max amount of $ one can earn for that map to purchase so many more upgrades had I tried beating it in hard mode. Upgrades purchased using that money mean almost squat to me for the next map(s) afterward on hard.  Sure I may barely be able to scratch by the next map or so but then once again I may be so frustrated to play back in story mode just to get as much money as possible to perhaps, possibly defeat the next 1 or 2 maps on hard.\n\nPerhaps it needs a more balance between money earned per mission\kill, and\or maybe a few more side missions you can do before each campaign mission as then you could be able to actually play the game in hard mode 100%.\n\nWhen playing a map, defeating the objective without killing everybody. I find the very, very low amount of $ earned from the enemies still alive \ surrended units to be awful.  In the story you can kinda choose to be merciful (from saving people from slavers, choosing to save the vessel full of kids)   So instead no incentive to finishing a map's objective as fast as possible. Instead this game encourages me to massacre EVERYBODY.\n\n^^^^\nat the writing of this review, version 4.2 states that it is very low $ gained from non killed enemies. Thus encouraging you to kill everybody.\n\nIt's sometimes\usually hard to click on a character, as you have to click on their outline instead of the grid box they are on. sometimes I end up clicking a character 'above\below' the character intended\n\nPROS\n\nNice anime silliness story, I enjoy it.\n\nAwesome visuals, but sometimes even with auto skip it's still takes a while to get through a battle\n\nBoobs.

This one is fun, has replay value, scaling difficulty and a moderately decent storyline if you're used to jrpgs. This is really worth a playthrough, and then maybe a second playthrough at a harder difficulty.\n\nThere are a few bugs in the combat system, particularly around trying to select invalid targets. These lead to python crashes, but the system uses rollbacks and autosaves frequently and quickly (no long pause while it saves)... I suspect the AI forgets its hate on reload, but this is a rare enough problem, and is easily avoidable (and you may never see it as it's a result of a weird combination of mistakes. Speeding through the combat animations can sometimes lead to clicking on a place to move, which can scuttle a whole battle at the harder difficulties, if you're unlucky, so move slowly.

It is shaping up to be a great game, and aside from a few bugs, and some performance issues, I think the game is pretty much good to go. Sunrider: FA is currently free, so if you are interested in trying a visual novel/ RPG type of game, this might be a good bet. There is a decent Strategy aspect to the combat, that makes it not just hours of chatting back and fourth between characters. Overall I would recommend this game to anyone interested in, visual novels, JRPG's, anime, japan, mechs, space, or any variation there of. Again, Sunrider, is currently free on Steam, so now is as good a time as ever to try it.\n\nNote: This game contains some adult themes, and nudity, Play at your own risk.","July 10, 2014","true","9.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

This version appears to be the latest beta with some adjustments to the upgrade costs.  The story and tactical gameplay are fun, with lots of optons for different tactics and upgrade paths.  The difficulty settings allow for easy or extremely challenging battles, so you should be able to find a play style that appeals to you.  You may want to lower the music volume so you can hear the pilots' commentary during battle.\n\nYou will need to learn where the game expects you to click when selecting units for command or targetting, and there is some lag when many units are on the battle screen.  There is also (at the moment) a lack of documentation on some of the options available to the support units, but their use should become clear with a little experimentation.  I expect most of these issues to be addressed as the game continues development.\n\nHighly recommended!","July 9, 2014","true","10.6"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

But its new so didnt expect it to be perfect.\n\n2nd the fullscreen i'm not sure if this is for everyone or just me but the full screen doesnt work for me. I can only look at one section of the screen. So playing fullscreen mode wasnt an option. I like my desktop but i really like being submerged into games.\n\n3rd I would say the battle animations. I really would like a fast forward on it. Not a full skip due to the fact that I'm sure they worked hard on the animations. But some sort of fast forward.\n\n4th the miss clicking. This was mainly due to the lag, but cant get over it. I had to restart so many fights just because i used the wrong command or an attack that costed me the fight.\n\nThis game has alot of potential so please keep working at it.

If you do, then you owe it yourself to give Sunrider: First Arrival a try. For a free, visual novel that's still in beta, this game is looking very promising.\n\nThe story, art, and characters are all well done, enjoyable and memorable. The turn-based battles involving the grid overview add a little more interactivity to the game as opposed to the standard 'read text and then make decisions' found in most typical visual novels. I enjoyed the game more for the story and the characters rather than for the turn-based battle system however, though the battles themselves were decently enjoyable up until the last few battles nearing the end of the game, where things began to get really tedious (and somewhat unforgiving). The fully voiced unit/character responses during the battle sequences are also a nice touch, and serve to give fights a more personal feeling, as characters begin to sound more desperate/concerned the more their ship's/ryder's health declines.\n\nThose who wish to avoid or have no interest in the battle aspect of this game may be disappointed to know that there is currently no way to skip battles and just read through the game as a visual novel. However, there are difficulty settings which can make progressing through battles more rapid, or, if you're the type who really enjoys formulating strategies, much more difficult where every move must be carefully calculated in order to succeed.\n\nOverall, Sunrider: First Arrival is a title you may want to keep an eye on, as the game is already highly enjoyable and playable in its current state. There's drama, comedy, tragedy, and moral decisions to be found in the main story, and I found myself immersed in the plot so much to the point where I felt responsible for the decisions I had to make during the course of the game. Not only that, but I also felt that I actually cared about what happened to the characters; each of them have their distinct personalities and somehow manage to be endearing in their own ways...\n\nWhether it's due to the epic soundtrack, the 'cutesy anime-style character drawings', the drama of the story, the turn-based battle system, or any combination of these, Sunrider: First Arrival is a game that truly deserves your attention. It might not be completely polished (I experienced some kind of glitching or slowdown in many of the battle sequences), but for a game of this high quality to be made available completely for free is something I'd consider as a most welcome (and possibly unforgettable) gift.\n\nPlay it:\n- For the story.\n- For the art, characters, and music.\n- If you like or have an interest in anime.\n\nDon't play it:\n- If you only want to play a polished, turn-based strategy game. (It's not bad, but you'll mostly be spending your time reading.)","July 14, 2014","true","16.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/larienna/recommended/313730/","larienna","larienna","http://steamcommunity.com/id/larienna/","19 products in account","This is s story based Japan anime game with tactical strategy in between. Now for sombody who hate story based games (for example, those made by bioware), I am surprised to see that I actually like the story in this game. I am still trying to figure out why. As for the tactical strategy of the game, it is relatively interesting. Each rider has various kind of weapons and abilities which allow various combinations and strategies.\n\nNow, for the bad side, first the interface, there are numbers so small on the screen that I cannot see them. I plugged my lap top on a television and it became worse, could not even see the hit percentages. The other faling aspect is that it is hard to predict the effectiveness of your attack. They are many different weapons and counter measure, that it's hard to understand and plan ahead their interaction. You can even have situation where a weapon that does 200 points of damage does more than 200 points. So the computations are hard to anticipate, more explanations would have helped. The AI is OK, I just find it very annoying when they target always the same rider, especially the pheonix.\n\nThere are a lot of powerup and upgrades, a bit too much, sometimes you can have two way to get the same results. For example, you could increase your rider's energy, but also reduce the energy cost of weapons. Which is 2 ways to do the same thing. As for the story engine, I am surprised how they managed to have a strong story based game with few art, interesting for low budget games. Everything is basically written in the text, sometimes a few additional picture would have helped to know what is going on. Semi manga style drawing would have been cool even if only black and white, but I understand that artwork is expansive.\n\nThere is still 1 quick fix that could be done, show the face of the talking character (above or under the name). It sometimes becomes very confusing who is talking to who. Having a framed picture change after each line of dialog would help, and would not require additional art.\n\nFinally, the game is pretty much linear, in the early game, you had a choice between 3 missions, I would have hoped to get those choices more often in the game. Also the story choices lead to the same results most of the time. I am not asking for something like mass effects, but at least get different results and rewards from your choices.\n\nIf you like turn based strategy games and you are a fan of Japanese animation and culture, I strongly recommend this game.\n\nEnjoy and have fun!","October 24, 2015","true","17.7"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

Sunrider: First Arrival is your typical visual novel where you find yourself in galactic civil war, commanding ships and mechs that is styled with a mixture of chess and battleships, ethical choices and attractive young pilots. Huh, thinking about it, guess it's not your typical visual novel. If you've played War of the Human tanks, conflicts are similar except turned based. Furthermore, it's free, everybody likes free stuff.\n\nPros:\n+Mechs\n+Engaging sci-fi conflict\n+Multiple and interesting heroines\n+Fantastic VGM\n+Ethical choices\n+Challenging. Being outnumbered and out gunned.\n+Free\n+Bewbs\n\nCons:\n-Short. To be honest, I was hoping for it to be longer but it's a tad short.\n-Challenging. Being outnumbered and out gunned.\n\n\nNote: I'm a little bias here as I'll love Visual Novels and anime. Also, if anyone has played visual novels like Koihime Musou, Sunrider is a futuristic version except, less women and less eroge. Furthermore, if you've played War of the Human tanks, battles scenarios are similar except turned based.\n","July 12, 2014","true","8.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Problem is that even when there are almost no effects or any advanced graphics it still stutters like hell in some parts for whatever reason even on PC that runs latest games on ultra, its just pictures and moving pictures i dont get it.\n\nGameplay? typical turn based strategy in combat if you get in some  the whole game is like 7 or 8 fights and visual novel rest. And of course difficulty, u think normal difficulty is ok, but when you play one fight 6th time you know its not as normal as you thought even easy isnt realy easy :D, there is many things you can upgrade on sunrider or mechs but there is so much options and so little cash and those upgrades arent realy strong unless you spend all money on one attribute, but then you have no cash and when you get to part where there is like 20 enemies witht unlimited supply of rockets you know you are doomed.\n\nCharacters? main character is called Kayto Shields i think that game designer who come up with this name, was on LSD. there are no male characters only the master Kayto Shields, whole story is about how Kayto got his harem.\n\nBut when you get to part where Claude do a handjob a for you, or naked Asuga shower scene you know its worth it.\n\n10/10 there are no flaws,\n\ni reccomend only for fun, if it was a serious game i wouldnt even play it.","July 16, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

A visual novel that combines tactics and amazing plot is a plus for me. Generally, I tend to get a little bored with normal visual novels as the plot can drag.

Currently, I am about an hour into the game and loving every moment.

Other then that, the story is piling on and on, only getting better. The characters, while having tropes seem to be interesting. New enemy units have been introduced... However this is missing the one thing that all mecha anime have: a enemy team with Unique mecha like the protaginists. There are a main enemy and the one pirate girl, but i want more colorful mecha to fight!!!! The game is still tricky, an interesting and welcome thing to most people. The only other problem i have is The animation and voice acting. I understand that this is a kickstarter and it doesn't have much money, if i could provide i would, however i seem to be broke at the moment. Even so the animation is almost non-existent, and some of the voice acting is really bad. An example would be Shields, when initiating the Vanguard cannon, seems to have little effort, as if the voice actor wasn't really trying or didn't enjoying the role, and as an aspiring voice actor this makes me frusterated. I look forward to when the animation is improved and the voice acting more prominent. Other then that, fanboying\n\nEdit: I read recently that the next part of the story needs to be paid for, and while i understand they need to make money, it makes me want to play less, as i won't be able to gett the new story.

Anime characters? Check. Mechs? CHECK!\n\nSunrider: first Arrival is a space based RPG where the player gets to command the Sunrider carrier ship and save the galaxy from the evil PACT, all with the help of some anime schoolgirls and their death dealing Mechs known as Ryders.\n\nPlayers get to make RPG-like morality based decisions such as save some civilians, or maybe kill them for a greater good. Of course the characters have their cliche ridden responses but this is acceptable and entertaining if anime drama is mildly interesting to you. The game soundtrack is suitably grand with a few different themes, but you may end up muting it after a while as the tracks are short and loop quickly. Voice acting is fairly limited as the story is told via text and visual effects.\n\nThe combat screen is where this game really shines. Units are presented on a grid, and each has a limited number of action points to spend on movement and attacks. Each offensive action triggers a brief anime style cut scene showing the unit making an attack as the crew member delivers a line of dialogue. There aren't many of these so they repeat frequently during a long battle, though who really gets tired of hearing 'Imma firing mah laser!'?\n\nFighting battles will be a fairly familiar process for players that are used to turn-based games, but the design of the interface often gets in the way of quick play - why have a unit only be selectable by clicking on a tiny area near it's middle? Or why have the weapon icons selectable only by clicking a tiny area somewhere above their middle? It's simply bad design that will infuriate you when it takes five attempts to get the game to register your click. Where are the shortcut keys? Why does the action skip over enemies' misses, but makes you click/space bar after they land a hit? Why are the unit health and action point bars so difficult to see and why oh why do they get covered over by a unit in the square below? Despite these issues the underlying combat is well designed, providing a strong challenge on normal difficulty.\n\nWinning a battle yields a reward based on your performance which you can spend to upgrade your carrier and Ryders' defensive and offensive abilities. The selection including upgrades to armour, action points, weapons damage and accuracy. Increasing your battle effectiveness and helping you progress through the game.\n\nSunrider would benefit from some polishing up, and no doubt the developers will do so in the future, especially if they wish to make a series of these games. Despite that it's engaging and fun to play, and as a Free to Play game is highly recommended.\n","July 14, 2014","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsukiyui/recommended/313730/","itsukiyui","伊月ゆい","http://steamcommunity.com/id/itsukiyui/","202 products in account","Sunrider is a turn based strategy visual novel, part of an episodic series still in development.\nIf that didn't turn you away already then this game is probably something you will enjoy playing.\n\nStory: a mishmash of every anime/visual novel cliche from random bursts of world destroying powers and every stereotype you have come to love and hate (with the exception of the yandere.....). However the setting and the actual game element to this vn sets it apart enough to feel fresh, although near the end of the 4th hour I was ready for the ending. Don't expect feels, don't expect enough NSFW to be of...ahem... use..... and don't expect the game element to carry it. There was no apparent or odd spelling/grammar errors and everyone felt real enough to care a little bit. Oddly there was one conversation option that didn't have any response and I was just greeted with the same previous options after choosing it.\n\nGameplay: The game is built in the Ren'Py engine, and it suffers for it. Everything is smooth and runs well enough during the actual novel bits but the moment the game element comes into play the fps drops the engine chugs and I was worried it would crash mid battle (although it never did). The battles have some thought put into them and there is depth here to be found, the problem is the game explains nothing; I didn't know what I should be pumping research points into (you don't even have enough cash to really develop anything anyways so just max out the armor options) nor did I know what flak or any other weird element did, just trial and error with different attack options until something clicks. It came down to me abusing chigara's skill that makes 1 enemy unit and movable and outside of a couple units (i.e. icara using melee 99% of the time) I just spammed lazers or kinetic depending on what did the most damage.\nThe game is highly dependent on RNG's and I started out on the hard setting, switched to normal, then switched to easy, and by the last two fights I was on novel mode because I couldn't be arsed hoping my attacks would hit and the enemies would miss. It is a shame and I feel like this is what holds the game back so much. Between the terrible slowdown repetitive battle cries from teammates and the terrible RNG battles became a chore once the novelty wore off.\n\nPresentation: The music, is perfect. Simply put it fit the situations well the ed and op tracks were fantastic and the quality was up there with something I would expect to find in a AAA game. The art is also beautiful and some of the backdrops really are fantastic, the problem is there isn't enough of it and some of the backdrops seem terribly done and empty (the cafeteria for example) and it throws me off when the rest of the game is so perfect. There is a cute little bonus novel attached and I never felt like anything was ugly. The sound effects of the guns and missles firing and connecting feel satisfying and most of the voice overs were well done.\n\n\nConclusion: This is a niche game, its apparent from the combo of turn based gameplay and VN and its apparent from the setting. The engine really does hold this game back and the episodic nature will probably turn others away since there won't be a "real" conclusion. However being that this is a free download if you are even considering giving this game a go just do it. There is a lot of apparent work and love from the developer(s?) on this project and if you don't really enjoy the game after all you didn't really lose out being that this is a quick free download of a fun quirky game. I enjoyed it enough to finish it through but unless the developer switches engines or fixes some very apparent issues I will probably not give the second half my time even though I enjoyed the first half enough to reccommend it.\n\n\nTL;DR there are actually no space whales :[","July 27, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

It's biggest problem is that it is really the introduction of what is to come. So I will give the story a 7.\n\nThe character interaction is fairly classic romance comedy manga/anime however the story luckily doesn't linger long enough for the interaction to get "forced" in an attempt to obey the tropes, however this also means it doesn't linger long enough for the character to step outside this confine and develop to more unique characters. There is pretty much just one character we see any real development with, even though a few of the others seems ready to develop they fail to do so. So the interaction I will give a 6, its good but it doesn't lift the story any higher.\n\nThe combat are fairly straight forward but quite hard and a few of the missions are almost impossible, but on the up side it gives you a lot of option in what you want to do and how to expend your resources. For turned based combat it is actually really good at what it does, so I will give combat an 9.\n\nThe upgrade system is a bit of a mess frankly, while it is easy to see what you upgrae some iof the upgrades are meaningless in the increments they are in and otehrs are too expensive for the boost they do give. I feel this system needs a lot of adjusting or an overhaul, luckily you can "reclaim" all the money you spend to fiddle around with what works best. So since it still seems somewhat incomplete I will give it a 4.\n\nThe artwork is good, and to me seems very macross/robotech inspired for the msot parts the only thing that really got on my bad side was the use of "school uniform" outfit rather than uniforms or similar off duty clothes. So I will give this an 9.\n\nThe game itself can be unresponsive at times and be slow to react or because it is so slow to process where you click it makes you take an unintended action, this is very bad in the battles as these are really hard as they are already. So to play this game you need to saddle yourself with patience to make sure the game knows what you just pushed before moving on. Also the "target" places on the units you can select to affect with the action does not dictate if you select the right target rather their unit graphic (ryder or ship) does, this means a tall unit can partially cover for the above unit causing you to select the wrong one. Anyway I will give the "system" a 3, it is not unplayable, but it is very frustrating.\n\nSo overall I will give this game a 6, it has a lot of good qualities but a few glaring problems that in the current form needs to be fixed.","July 13, 2014","true","15.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

What can I say? I saw this Visual Novel was free and downloaded it, expecting to get the biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥. Man, was I surprised to learn that this game actually ended up being quite decent. I won't lie, I had more fun playing this than I had so far in World End Economica even though this one is free, unlike WEE.\n\nPros:\n\n- It's f*cking free\n- Simple to understand gameplay\n- Story doesn't try to reinvent the wheel. It's nothing new, but presented in a good way, easy for you to get into and actually be interested in it.\n- Awesome OST. You know how a lot of these kinda games have awful music? Well, this ain't one of these. Enjoyed it from the beginning to the end\n- Voice Acting is quite fine. Sure, not the best job I have ever seen, but far from the worst ever. I actually didn't even have to flinch even once in this game because of it. Some lines even made me laugh.\n- Characters are likeable. Granted, they are somewhat stereotypical Japanese archetypes, but hell...I didn't mind. They even made fun about it in some of the character lines. ("WHAT!? I am not doing this because I like you or something, (BAKA!)")\n- Some Memes and other funny references, which make you chuckle once you hear them for the first time. (featuring "Imma firin' mah lazzor!" and "Uuuu~ 'You will just be fanservice' they said..."\n\nCons:\n- No "restart mission" option, other than the one in the game over screen. SOmetimes you just know you have lost, but still have to wait for your entire fleet to get shot down. Annoying.\n- No tooltips for the skills, forcing you to learn their effects via trial and error\n- The missile/rocket dmg system is somewhat broken. There were fights in which I died during the first round cause every enemy space ship decided to launch rockets at my Sunrider, which just would never get intercepted by anyone, despite having 3 ryders capable of shooting them down placed near the ship.\n- The game is a bit short. There are only 6 or so missions in total. It's not too few, but it could have been more. I know there is supposedly a new episode coming out, though, so take this one with a grain of salt.\n- Laggy animations once you start to skip them\n- The difficulty level on "normal" ranges from "Wow, look...boobs in space...wheee" (first mission) to "You better start saving after every move if you wanna win this battle" (last mission). Seriously, I hope you like the design of the game over screen, cause you are gonna see that thing A LOT.\n\nAll in all, I would say this is probably the best free game currently on steam, aside from TF2. It is well made and was a lot of fun.\n\nTL;DR:\n\n- Boobs\n- Space\n- Explosions\n\nRATED M for MANLY!","July 21, 2014","true","0.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

You'll be glad you did. Coming from someone who is completely ambivalent towards the waifu aspect of the game, I have found this to be one of the most inspiring gaming experiences of recent months.\n\nYou play as Captain Kayto Shields, first-time commander of the newest, most hi-tech Assault Carrier in the Cera Space Force, the Sunrider. Unfortunately, disaster strikes and your home planet is overthrown by an evil expansive space empire known as PACT, casting you and your crew into the middle of a Galactic Civil War! Beginning with just your own ship to command, your hangar bay will fill gradually with mechs known as 'Ryders', whose female pilots you will meet at regular intervals as you journey to liberate your homeland from these foreign invaders!\n\nNow... given that this game is free, you get a lot for your money. The combat system is very concise, straight-forward and user-friendly. Each ship and ryder in your fleet will have different abilities and be stronger against certain enemies than others. There are also RPG aspects as you can pay to upgrade the stats of both the Sunrider and any Ryders in her compliment, while black market traders offer you various bonus upgrades like high-end boosters or ammunition upgrades for your cannons. In addition to the gameplay being top notch, there is an interesting and exciting overarching plot which, while occassionally bogged down with things like bikini parties on the beach (because muh fanservice), is often driven by a very strong cast of both main and supporting characters facing the very serious moral and ethical dilemmas of war and intergalactic politics.\n\nThe downsides are few. The game tends to lag a bit in combat, which is annoying but not to the point of unplayability. Also if you are incredibly averse to either animé or the concept of waifu harem games, this very may well not be the game for you. But if you can look past it's faults, Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius will probably be one of the best free games you ever play.","August 4, 2015","true","14.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While the game is mainly a single path, there are some choices to add interactivity and the backstory is quite interesting at times.\n\nBest of all, with the story, is the art, and most importantly the music.

Loren gets 5 out of 5 stars while Stronghold and Sunrider both science fictions get 4 out of 5 stars. You can't beat Sunriders price. One way to enjoy the game more is to save the beginning of each combat battle then play each battle several times using different strategies which will allow you to discover the different tactical advantages of your team and ships. The use of stealth and close combat by one of the team members gets the blood flowing. Another of the team heals or causing electronic headaches for the enemy. Combined tactics that support other members of the team is the only way I have been able to beat the enemy. The romance just adds icing to the cake and bonds you to the charaters.

Loren gets 5 out of 5 stars while Stronghold and Sunrider both science fictions get 4 out of 5 stars. You can't beat Sunriders price. One way to enjoy the game more is to save the beginning of each combat battle then play each battle several times using different strategies which will allow you to discover the different tactical advantages of your team and ships. The use of stealth and close combat by one of the team members gets the blood flowing. Another of the team heals or causing electronic headaches for the enemy. Combined tactics that support other members of the team is the only way I have been able to beat the enemy. The romance just adds icing to the cake and bonds you to the charaters. Who in the world would not want a wacky group of women on board your vessel of destruction. Captain Kirk never had it so good but you can in Sunrider.","July 21, 2014","true","11.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I wouldn't mind purchases dlc that opens up more story and gameplay if it meant helping the game improve.\n\n(Again this is just a opinion from playing abit of this game, I already read that this isn't a finished/polished game yet so this opinion will end up being old at some point and this is Only from MY point of view so please no negative comments)","July 24, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

This game took risks (which I like) like the visual novel, the turn based space combat, and the fact the story is reliant on being a trilogy whether or not the first entry works, yet this game went through the stratosphere at FTL and I don't think it's stopping. I loved the looks of the mechs and ship which had a lot more detail on them than I thought they were going in, and though I would have liked some FMV sequences during combat and story driven "cutscenes" than images changing and beam effects swiping across the screen (though it made the death of one of the games villians hillarious, you know who I'm talking about) the images were able to convey what was needed. The characters were fairly likeable though you will have favorites among the crew, Mine was Asaga. The combat was fairly nice and challenging even on easy mode where you still need to use strategy instead of brute force, though novel mode does throw that idea out of the window, but it is there for those who care about story. If you like mechs, Spaceships, anime, and cute girls in spandex outfit this game is for you, I mean look at the price!

The Ryders and especially the Sunrider are great designs.\nA good homage to the anime Space Opera with many familiar archtypes for fans of that genre.\n\nDislikes:\nArt style clashes a bit with the more mature segments of the game.\nCharacter development is non-existent.\nThere are also several moments in the game where it feels like they might have tried to delve more into the characters and their interactions but then were suddenly cut from the game.\nVoiced segments clash with the set personalities aboard ship.  I.E Icari is suddenly Tsundere in battle as opposed to the mature pseudo-sociopath she comes across when aboard ship.\nNot enough resources to fully explore the upgrade system especially for first time players.\nBeta, which means some bugs.  Ran into one where the Sunrider completely disappeared from the game.\nThey don't play that catchy J-pop song enough and when they do it cuts off during the enemy's turn.\nMain characters voice during Vanguard Cannon scene is absolutely awful.\nNo ability to listen to game BGM's yet.\nNo dramatic changes from in game decisions as far as I could see.\n\nSo you might notice that several of the above mentioned dislikes would be a death knell for most VN's, seeing as they are story driven experiences.  If someone told me to pay up fifteen or twenty dollars for this game I would have said no.  Frankly I'd hesitate to pay five dollars.  The quality of the story and characters swings back and forth from "Pretty Good" to "wut?" and that sense that the author kept all the character development in his head instead of in game is strong, even overwhelmning at times.  Or whole scenes between characters just ditched on the cutting room floor for some reason.  So why would I give this a thumbs up you might ask?\n\nBecause it is free.  As a free product, this makes for an enjoyable way to pass the time.  The gameplay itself is pretty solid and enough to keep you interested provided you are willing to learn the upgrade system.  Unfortunately the game doesn't give you enough cash to really take advantage of it.  Too many things on too many different craft to upgrade to really explore with what they give you and that sucks because a huge part of enjoying the combat in game is using that system.\n\nSo yes, as a VN it has problems.  You might even say crippling ones and I'd be hard pressed to argue diffrently.  But if you're looking for something to do for a few hours, you can't go wrong with this.  You can see and taste the potential here but that's all it is at the moment, potential.  Maybe future episodes will be better.","July 19, 2014","true","26.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

As far as an anime game pretty much everything is there, cute girls ride space mechs in skin tight suits, with a bachelor who is probably not even 20 piloting a space ship with a huge gun sitting on top, yep typical anime game. Oh and did I mention that the voice acting, while sometimes repetitive is absolutely hilarious IMA FIRIN MAH LAZERS!!! As far as a turn based tatical rpg game everything is also there, a playing field with a limited per turn energy system that allows you to only do a certain number of actions per turn. There is also of course the variety of weapons you have to use on different ships/ mechs to deal more damage, as well as special abilities that can make or break the battle.\n\nNow on to the bad side of the game. I understand this game IS STILL IN BETA, that being said there are some definent issues to work out. The animations are laggy, sometimes the animations will start right away, sometimes it will take about 5 seconds. The game has not crashed once, but the resolution while adjustable does not work! te only thing that will change is windowed/ full screen, so even when in a 16:9 resolution it still appears in window as 4:3, which is a bit unfortunate because it makes livestreaming it in a 16:9 resolution difficult. I am sure these things will be fixed in upcoming versions, and do not render the game unplayable! That being said, the game is still enjoyable, and definetely worth playing!\n\n~jak113420\ntwitch.tv/jak113420","July 19, 2014","true","5.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenoks/recommended/313730/","xenoks","Serkevan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xenoks/","255 products in account","So, ten hours of gameplay. So Steam says, but considering I played quite a bit of it offline I'd reckon it took me around 15-20 hours to complete a playthrough of both "First Arrival" and "Mask of Arcadius" (the two chapters currently available; more are expected to come soon, still free of charge).\n\nOkay, let's get to it, shall we?\n\nTHE PLOTLet me explain: the "plot" and the "script" are entirely different things. That said, the plot is somewhat decent, although nothing to write home about: one-ship-army (sorta) against the OBVIOUSLY EVIL totally-not-space-commies. It is, however, quite well done. The pace of the story doesn't drag too heavily, the characters the waifus are likeable to different extents (did I mention this involves a male captain with an all-female crew? Well, at least all the crew we get to see) and the captain is not a total ♥♥♥♥♥ like is usually the case.\n\nTHE SHINY PARTSGraphics are anime-style, I personally liked them. It's 2D so not overly impressive, but the icons are clear and functional. The menus and combat UI are definitely something that can be improved from a comfort standpoint (sometimes selecting units is... well. Hit and miss), however. The sound is acceptable and the BGM is nice, but the voice acting is... well, it ranges from tolerable to SHUT UP ICARI Still second best waifu.\n\n\nAnd now, for the part nobody cares about lately in reviews.  THE GAMEPLAYSo, you think this is a visual novel, right? Well, it is! But, surprisingly enough, you GET to play (unless you scum your way with the aptly named Visual Novel Difficulty, but who am I to judge) around with a cruiser and space mechs that have quite interesting quirks. Battles are set on a hex grid, and... well, kinda sorta like every other tactical squad game ever invented, but you are not restricted to move-attack-end like, for example, XCom or Fire Emblem are. Every ship has a number of Action Points per turn, and every weapon (or movement) has a different cost. Also, units can be upgraded, there are several types of weapons and defense systems and special orders to be given. All in all, I've seen better battle systems, but this one gets the job done and it seems the developer is patching on occassion, so I can't complain much.\n\nSUMMARYAll in all, if you are into this kind of game and don't mind the fanservice (which, for now, is not overboard and there aren't explicit scenes unless you install the uncensored patch from the devs' website) I'd say go for it. I mean, it's free. If it wasn't... well, right now I probably wouldn't pay for it since it isn't completely finished, but it shows promise: I would consider it a worthy purchase after the rest of the main story is released.","December 31, 2014","true","10.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

I would gladly have payed to play this and am looking forward to Liberation Day when it arrives.\n\nThe choices you have to make are hard and really make you think, however I would like to see more of these choices and maybe include short and long term effects (or at least more of them).\n\nI also feel that the money system was a little flawed as there were not always enough chances to gain currency to upgrade the ships, or enough side missions.\n\nMaybe adding in more optional side missions which open up as you progress through the story or due to the choices you make, this would help those players who get stuck in certain situations.\n\nAnd lastly, I personally, would be intrested in the captain having a more active role in the combat. Maybe getting his own     Ryder. After all, the best bonds are born on the battlefield!\n\nOverall, an amazing game with a good story and was very fun despite, and even due to it's quirks.\n\nI'd rate it an 8/10!

You expend energy by moving and attacking, and so have to weigh the risks of moving closer to allow for greater accuracy, but at the risk of not sinking enemy ships (and of course, the increased accuracy from moving your units closer also applies to the enemies too). There are multiple attack types in the game, each of them playing into the weaknesses of enemy units (though I must admit that I struggled to keep track of which attacks I should be using on the various enemy unit types).\n\nMeanwhile, the story is presented as a fairly typical visual novel. The art looks really great, and the flight suits are wonderfully form-fitting... *ahem* The game is largely unvoiced however, so the only times you'll actually hear the characters speak is when attacking, or being attacked, during combat.\n\n(As an aside, the music sounds great, but I noticed it can be pretty jarring when they have different songs playing according to whether it's the player's turn or the AI's turn, and that dramatic music you were listening to just suddenly cuts out so the other one can start up.)","July 12, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Makes me wish the game will be available with japanese VAs too, really, this game would feel better with dual language dubs. Not that I complain with the english VAs. They've got it pretty decent. But hey, one can dream. Really. Wish this has the option to change the voiced audio played.\n\nThe one I'm having trouble with is about the unit selection method. Sometimes it's pretty tricky to select the correct unit when they're adjacent to each other. And really, one can miss target the unit they intend to attack or boost, because sometimes when you think you've selected the correct unit, you're actually select the unit in front of it (in matter of display order; which is usually the unit on the tile below it). Pretty frustrating.\nThough, for now, you can undo the movement.\n\nThe other things, being beta, some stuff is missing, and the game will blatantly tells you that some animation is not found where it's expected, some graphics not found, etc. Which brings me to another thing about notification.\nCan it be more visible? I mean, the text is just normal 12pt-ish font, which is easy not to be read.\nBoth because of it's size and the time it's on the screen, pretty quick to dissapear.\n\nOh and, being the customization and upgrades on the vessels are many, better ingame monetary system would help.","July 11, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

This game took risks (which I like) like the visual novel, the turn based space combat, and the fact the story is reliant on being a trilogy whether or not the first entry works, yet this game went through the stratosphere at FTL and I don't think it's stopping. I loved the looks of the mechs and ship which had a lot more detail on them than I thought they were going in, and though I would have liked some FMV sequences during combat and story driven "cutscenes" than images changing and beam effects swiping across the screen (though it made the death of one of the games villians hillarious, you know who I'm talking about) the images were able to convey what was needed. The characters were fairly likeable though you will have favorites among the crew, Mine was Asaga. The combat was fairly nice and challenging even on easy mode where you still need to use strategy instead of brute force, though novel mode does throw that idea out of the window, but it is there for those who care about story. If you like mechs, Spaceships, anime, and cute girls in spandex outfit this game is for you, I mean look at the price! Not even the terrible games that somehow get on greenlight are free so get this and try it! No free-to-play model, no in game store for real money, nothin' this game is 100% free!","September 11, 2014","true","22.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

What makes or breaks a game for me is it's storyline, and this game's storyline capivated me. It feel like I was playing a game from my childhood, but with a modern twist on it. I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy feeling for the game's characters, intense decisions that call on listening to logic or your conscience, and difficult TBS's that challenge you. The game has a few things that annoy me, like in battle not being able to see the bottom right corner of the map without zooming in, and the that i can't explore the Sunrider decks without a character in the portion of the ship to talk too.

You expend energy by moving and attacking, and so have to weigh the risks of moving closer to allow for greater accuracy, but at the risk of not sinking enemy ships (and of course, the increased accuracy from moving your units closer also applies to the enemies too). There are multiple attack types in the game, each of them playing into the weaknesses of enemy units (though I must admit that I struggled to keep track of which attacks I should be using on the various enemy unit types).\n\nMeanwhile, the story is presented as a fairly typical visual novel. The art looks really great, and the flight suits are wonderfully form-fitting... *ahem* The game is largely unvoiced however, so the only times you'll actually hear the characters speak is when attacking, or being attacked, during combat.\n\n(As an aside, the music sounds great, but I noticed it can be pretty jarring when they have different songs playing according to whether it's the player's turn or the AI's turn, and that dramatic music you were listening to just suddenly cuts out so the other one can start up.)","July 12, 2014","true","16.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Makes me wish the game will be available with japanese VAs too, really, this game would feel better with dual language dubs. Not that I complain with the english VAs. They've got it pretty decent. But hey, one can dream. Really. Wish this has the option to change the voiced audio played.\n\nThe one I'm having trouble with is about the unit selection method. Sometimes it's pretty tricky to select the correct unit when they're adjacent to each other. And really, one can miss target the unit they intend to attack or boost, because sometimes when you think you've selected the correct unit, you're actually select the unit in front of it (in matter of display order; which is usually the unit on the tile below it). Pretty frustrating.\nThough, for now, you can undo the movement.\n\nThe other things, being beta, some stuff is missing, and the game will blatantly tells you that some animation is not found where it's expected, some graphics not found, etc. Which brings me to another thing about notification.\nCan it be more visible? I mean, the text is just normal 12pt-ish font, which is easy not to be read.\nBoth because of it's size and the time it's on the screen, pretty quick to dissapear.\n\nOh and, being the customization and upgrades on the vessels are many, better ingame monetary system would help.","July 11, 2014","true","10.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","4"

I have long been a Visual Novel player, and while I have found several bugs that slow down the gameplay, they are minor at best. The story is interesting, and the cast fun. While the game is mainly a single path, there are some choices to add interactivity and the backstory is quite interesting at times.\n\nBest of all, with the story, is the art, and most importantly the music. Some of the best music I have ever heard in a VN. Worth playing just for the music alone; at least in my opinion.\n\nWould recommend Sunrider: First Arrival to any visual novel and Turn-Based game lover.

It doesn't have the character graphics that I totally love but the art is very nice. The designers have also found a way to make the animations interesting. The battle scenes are also good. The story focuses on how you, the captain, will save the galaxy while wooing your comrades. The game also includes a special setting that if you only like the visual novel part, the battle scences can be set to a point where you can't lose and if you love strategy/tactical games that much then you can change it to where enemies can only be beaten through a certain strategy. The heroines of the game have their own personality. The game also has good soundtracks. (if you love anime themes then you'll love it)\n\nPros:\n1. It's a Free to Play game, so there's no hurt in trying.\n2. The game has a great story and rumors say that it has a part 2.\n3. Your decision largely affects the story proegression. (I'm sorry, I don't want to spoil anyone so I can't give examples.)\n\nCons:\n1. The games has only a few soundtracks so every battle scenes, you'll be listening to the same track over and over again.\n\n2. The attack types (LASER, KINETIC, PULSE, MISSILE, MELEE) in the battle part are a bit confusing at first but you'll get the hang of it.\n\nSunrider: Mask of Arcadius is an interesting visual novel with a mix of humor, space battle, and drama. The storyline itself covers up to its lack in graphics.

The story is actually quite good, and I found myself quite engaged by the characters.  It's all delightfully cliche, but well told.  The battle system is also fun and had plenty of options, however the game really should encourage players to start on Ensign difficulty rather than Captain, which would be considered the "Very Hard" difficulty in most other games, and only for those already familiar with the game's concepts.\n\nFor a free game it's far more than I expected, and a great advertisement for the third installment.","October 24, 2015","true","26.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I look forward to the "all ages" version as having a nude character pop up on my screen for all to see in the living room was akward (didn't see Loli Assassin's warning). The voice acting was great!

The gameplay is a lovely grid-based strategy format, with a command points system for special attacks and abilities as well as a decent variety of special abilities and weapons per unit. Additionally, each unit can be upgraded quite a bit through the Sunrider's R&D section. On the standard difficulty, the combat isn't too difficult once you grasp the concepts of the game, however, there is a mode to essentially make each battle impossible to lose if you just want to experience the story.\n\nOn that note, the story is where this game truly shines. It has all the corny, cheesy scenes you might expect from a typical slice-of-life visual novel or anime, while doing so in such a way that it doesn't ruin the atmosphere that the game builds. Alongside those, there are rather intense, dramatic scenes and character development that serve only to add to the Sunrider experience. While there are no defined routes in this game (Only a positive/negative karma system depending on how much you care about your crew), the story and subtle romance vibes are still incredible. The voice acting is also amazingly good considering the size of the company that made Sunrider.\n\nMost of the music, although well-planned and suitable for each scene, is standard royalty-free music you will likely have heard somewhere else.

The utter lack of tutorialization does come up as a weak point, as do the semi-mandatory combat animations. These problems should be easily resolved with patching or in the sequels.\n\nCharacters are archetypal for the most part, but the plot is interesting. Takes a fairly cliched cast and story and instead of telling it straight or cynically deconstructing it, it uses these elements to create something original and worthwhile.\n\nI was reminded a lot of Mouretsu Pirates with the way this game handled galactic intrigue and conflict, and if you liked that then you'll probably like this.\n\nLooking forward to the sequels, hope developer Love in Space sticks around for more than just this series as well.","July 20, 2014","true","9.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

This game is similar but has less movement, but you still have to make the right movements to use the right attacks on the right enemies in order to win. for example, there is a very useful aoe spell that costs a lot of points that are earned after battle, so I like to save points just to use the aoe spell on a bunch of high hp ships.\n-rpg: your ship/robots are the chars whose stats you change. you use $ earned from battle to allocate strengths of the various attacks and defenses of the vessels.\n-difficulty: just about right. later, battles get harder, and early battles might take some re-dos to guage enemy strength, but there is no char permadeath. there is also a very useful autosave function, for those misclicks.\n\nmeh:\n-only female crew so far. If you're looking for males, there is only the MC, whose personality you build through the choices you make. so you can't really get to know a male crew member, as far as I know. There are generic male antagonists. The female crew aren't horribly written, but characters do try to appease those interested in relations with females.\n-misclicks: clicking too much to try to skip battle animations can cause units to move after attacking, expending their energy points. can force you to start from the closest autosave, or restart the battle.\n\n-no aliens or romancable space whales\n\ncurrent conclusion: I feel like i should give monies for this game, given how much I like it.\n\n~~\n\nso 20+ hours in or so, i've finally beaten the last three levels. third to last level (survive 6 turns) was difficult. I tried to wait it out with just two alliance ships, and played for 3 hours before lasting through 6 turns with just the sunrider at low hp. finished the level -1000 $ and -1000 command points, and it cost me a lot of time too; I found i could not beat the second to last level; I was pummeled to death by missiles on the first enemy turn, as I had no alliance battleships to do enough damage. So i restarted the survive 6 turns level with 4 mining laser ships, and retuned kryska's ryder into double kinetics/turn and the sunrider to have 2200 hp, in addition to having two alliance ships, in order to wipe out most of the enemy on the first and second turns with two carefully placed vanguard cannons, before the enemy could focus-fire people to death. success in that level led to a large army for the final levels, resulting in a much more manageable whittling away of the 25k hp boss ship. saw the kickstarter backers in the credits. definitely would want to back another installment of this, if another kickstarter pops up. for now, I await the third part.","October 4, 2014","true","25.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This visual novel has a nice story. Interactive and free. I love how this game reminds me of other games with similiar use of tactics. Nonetheless I believe the BG, Characters, Voices, and Art did show amazing continuity with it. Although I admit there is some details but as far as I have seen. This game has a lot of good even great. Multiple endings some choices, and to be honest if you liked War of the Human Tanks, you will like this. Also if you played any of other recently available on Steam VNs as of late, you will find a nice mixture. This one actually kept me entertained and interested. Although I admit pork chops should die, seriously and that goblin midget with a mask needs to get kicked like a football. I'm loving the game. What I find amazing is that it is simple and yet it reminds of me many other sci-fi related games. This game has provided me much entertainment and I do recommend it. It's not high action paced but the animations and the voice acting is what sold me. How many have actually done that? I'm not talking about VA in the scenes although that would be a plus but cost, however when they fight you hear them. I found that through this game a nice gravity of choice between the reality of what you want to do and have to do. Personally the comical relief brought about through the characters in between also helps. Not always so doom and gloom but it shows that there is more on people's mind. The artwork is very decent, the ships animations on firing were nice, the dialogue seems to be great. Some scenes show emotion and even makes me want to hear their voice. It's this type of game I do like. It gives you more than enough but it's so close to perfect they tempt you. Even though the voice acting isn't done, and the scenes with dialogue could use some more action, I do believe this is a 9-10 out of 10 in my book. Well done!","October 11, 2014","true","13.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/1525/recommended/313730/","1525","Arkayn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/1525/","256 products in account","Come for tactical space battles - stay for the plot. And the uh, "plot".\n\nTo be more elaborate, this game did an excellent job of being just intriguing enough to pull me in - I'm a total foreigner to visual novels, so this is a game that wouldn't normally have crossed my radar. The combat is fun, difficult, and each battle almost has a puzzle-like quality to it. Once you finally figure out the winning strategy, you feel great. It IS difficult, though, and can be frustrating until you finally hit on that winning strategy. Of course, you could always surrender your pride, and lower the difficulty...\n\nMy impression of visual novels before this was probably like most people's - it's interactive pornography, right? And while that may be true for some - it certainly isn't true for Sunrider. The characters are well-developed, and they develop well. These aren't static characters - they're affected by your decisions, and it shows. It's a testament to the game's excellent writing and storytelling that the all-female cast doesn't come off as silly.\n\nMy favorite part of the game so far has been the decisions forced upon you. Lots of games have branching storylines, and different outcomes based on your choices, but very rarely are those choices difficult to make. More often than not, there's a clear cut "good" path, and an equally obvious "evil" path. This game doesn't do that. You lead a ship in the middle of a brutal war, and the story reflects that. Rarely is a choice obvious, and even after making the call, you're likely to agonize over it afterwards.\n\nThis game is difficult, it's dark, it's brutal, but it's also really really fun. The gameplay is fun, the story is exciting, the characters are interesting. And it's free. There really is no reason not to give Sunrider a shot. Fans of visual novels will likely love the game, and for everyone else, I say give it a shot. This is a game that will surprise you.","November 26, 2014","true","12.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The characters are all unique with their own backstories that aren't quite fully explored and are shrouded in mystery for the most part still, but this is mainly so that more of the Visual novels can be made for this series, and i would happily welcome more edditions, especially if they are free like this one.\n\nNow for the cons, there are so little side quests, you wonder why it introduced it at the start in the first place. I took time out of going from new sector to sector revisitng old ones hoping to find a side quest but didnt find any and was really disappointed. Missles feel vastly over powered in this game, doing high damage to units and yes whilst they are limited, later in the game when facing vast amounts of foes, the last thing you want is to be bombarded by dozens of missles to your flag ship. I also felt like i didnt get enough time in this first installation to get to know some of the characters, having them for a few missions only, whilst others you want to see more of because of how great of a character they are but seem to be forgotten about.\n\nSome skills are missing and they openly tell you about this, and upgrades for some units are non existant, but so it the large amount of spare cash to effectivly feel like a real difference has been made asside from more missle slots.\n\nBut some of the best things i like about this Visual novel is the story, the voice acting during battle makes you feel more immersed and in command. The commands are great but very VERY expensve on the command points, which can be extremely irritating trying to save up and decide when to use due to really needing them in the later levels. But the best attacking being the Vanguard Beam really feels like the end all of all weaponry. It gets its own unique mini cutscene and attacking animation, slicing through all foes like a knife through butter and i really wish there were more attacks like this, maybe 1 for each pilot on the ship .

Around the story you can make decisions, rarely a game makes me stop to think about the consequences of my choices.\n\n+combat\nturn based strategy, knowing when to advance, when to fire with a specific type of weapon and many other things is essencial. This game even have some sort of agro system (seen this kinda thing in army of two), basically if you cause substantial amount of damage with a specific unit in the next turn is very likely that the enemy AI will focus fire on that unit. This agro mechanic can be an advantage or disadvantage is up to the player to decide how to used it.\n\n+soundtrack\nMusic is nice anime like quality and the sound effects aren't bad either.\n\n+characters\nLike the story, not the best but i've seen worse. Some caracters are based on anime stereotypes like:\nIcari a.k.a tsundere ツンデレ\nChigara a.k.a dandere ダンデレ\nSola a.k.a kuudere クウデレ\nAsaga a.k.a Genki Shoujo 元気少女\nThere may be more but that's all i know\n\n+universe\nHas some interesting details like history and technology.\n\nthe bad\n-Difficulty\nFor beginners this game can kick your ♥♥♥ if you're not familiar with its combat mechanics, i think the Devs should add an training tutorial. Sometimes even when you're used to the mechanics the AI just keep spamming hordes of infinite missles and certain missions requires specific types of upgrades, which means that if you don't have the necessary upgrade you will likely lose.\n\n-combat UI\nThe user interface during combat should be improved, i can't count the many times i tried to click in one place and ended up clicking what i wasn't supposed to.\n\n\nOveralll\nI'm impressed what a small team managed to do so far, I wish luck and fortune for the developers.\n\n\noctober 6 2014\nmask of arcadius\n\nthe good\n+story\nI feel like that the story improved, i really enjoyed the darker tone of this part\n\n+combat\nAlmost the same of the first part but now the player can buy alliance cruisers, union frigates, shield generator for the sunrider, etc...  New units appear to fight for you and against you.\nSome missions can be challenging making you stay on your toes and sweat, but they are not impossible. However there are moments which it feels that the enemies have some sort  of OP advantage which ill cover later.\n\n+side missions\nThey added more side missions to this part ( i think 4) and all can be accomplished. Ex: Side mission B, C, D will not dissapear if side A is completed, unlike the first part of sunrider where you could only do one mission)\n\n+soundtrack\nThey added some new musics that are very good\n\n+characters\nWe ge to know the past of some characters and also see some character development.\n\n+combat interface\nThey improved combat interface, is rare when you click in something that didn't wanted to and the game doesn't "lag" anymore when there's a great quantity of units on screen\n\n\n\nthe bad\n-Rocket spamming\nSeriusly, the enemies have way more rockets than you do per unit and just can keep spamming you all day. To make it worse enemies now have support ryders that can disable your flak defenses. So i would suggest the devs to balance this issue by: decrease capacity of missles of enemy units or increase capacity of missles of my units or remove/decrease the flak worn off mechanic (the more missles the enemy shot at you the les it becomes effective)\n\n-Enemy carriers\nI feel that they are a little OP specially because they can deploy support ryders (2 at once!), and once deployed they can instantly attack/take action. My suggestion: make carriers being able to only deploy one support ryder instead of 2 at once and have a "cooldown" where the unit deployed by the carrier has to wait 1 turn before being able to act and the carrier have to wait 1 turn to be able to deploy again\n\n-upgrades\nUpgrades still feel dissapointing because they only start to become usefull at high levels which can cost a ton of money, seriusly when i hear upgrades i expect that the performance of my ships to become better in a notable way\n\nOverall\nStill impressed if this game, even with some bugs at launch date the devs tried to fix the issues and communicate with the players to help them ASAP. S2 Devs\nCan't wait for the third part. Keep up the good work Love in Space!","August 19, 2014","true","19.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I feel that the devs had done a very good job considering the limited amount of resources they have.\n\nThe artwork is good and the story is decent. Animation is minimal, but then, aniamtion is expansive to produce. Combat is simple, but surprisingly engaging.\n\nYour capital ship and ryder (mechs) are specialized in different areas and proper useage of them is essential for victory. For example, your capital ship has good long range weaponry against other capital ships and can provide a large defensive flak cover, so it is usually placed in the middle of your fleet. One of the ryder is very mobile and is very effective at taking out other ryders, but is fragile and have limited range, it can be used near the front lines, move out, take out a few enemy ryder and then retreating back to cover.\n\nDefensively, units need to be positioned such that their shield and flak stack together to defend each other more effectively. Moving aggresively might net you a kill, but those out of position units will take much more damage.\n\nFor the offence, you have missiles, lasers and kinetic weapons which are countered by flak, shield and armor respectively. Analyzing the best way to get pass the enemy defences is an interesting puzzle. For example, the first turn might be used to disable the enemy capital ship shields and use long range lasers to kill the high damage but fragile missile frigate. 2nd turn with the shield respawned, move in closer and use kinetic weapons to take out the enemy ryder who has no armor. Lastly with the flak defense from the ryder gone, disable the capital ship's own flak and kill them with missiles.\n\nKilling enemy units will grant you money which can then be use to upgrade your ship and ryder to make them more powerful and more suited to your play style.\n\nThe only problem I have is with the lack of tooltips and awkard controls. For example, when encountering a new type of enemy, there is no way for you to know what type of weapons it has before it fire them at you. When trying to click on another unit with an unit already selected, its easy to misclick and unintentionally move the aleady selected unit by mistake. (Cancel move is possible, but require quick reflects to click it before it disappear) However, since that saving in the middle of the conbat is possible, save often and this is only a minor annoyance.","August 27, 2014","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Extremely enjoyable for the time I played.\n\nStory starts off boring and bland, but I mean pretty much everything has been "done before", so it's all about the nuances you add to spice things up.  I think Sunrider adds enough of its own spin to make it enjoyable.\n\nThe thing I really like are some of the moral choices you have to make.  Real, moral choices.  Not the bland "save the kitten" or "burn the entire village" sort of "moral" choice.  Real choices that have both merits and hefty consequences for choosing either one.  I love that and I wish more games did this.\n\nThe characters are a little underveloped, but the game only took a handful of hours to complete, so that's hardly unexpected.  There's enough hints going around to leave me optimistic about the characters.\n\nCombat is fun.  I made the mistake of not realizing you could upgrade your teammates as well as your main ship.  Probably would have made the game easier, but I still managed to beat it on normal in a timely manner.\n\n\nTo anyone wanting to beat this game on normal or hard, I would highly suggest learning the missile and flak mechanics.  If you don't know how to align your units in order to fend off missile assaults, you'll end up a ball of wreckage in no time.  Look to some of the negative reviews below to see what I mean.\n\nAll in all, an unfinished game with tons of promise!  I donated money (a first for me in my couple decades of gaming).  I'm excited to see the game progress to its full potential!\n\nP.S. Why is there so little love for Kriska? She comes in relatively late...but she's too adorable with her ramrod demeanor!\n\nP.S.S.

The character art is solid.  It has a ridiculously epic soundtrack.  It has a very involved battle system for something coded on Ren'py.  It's a totally free doujin/indie-style visual novel.\n\nThat's all plenty enough for a recommendation from me.\n\nBut I do have problems with it.  It needs editing.  Lot's of grammatical mistakes.  I'm hardly good with shpeeling, but I noticed a few typos or misused words really quickly.\nBattles are kick-your-teeth-in difficult.  This is Dark Souls Waifu Strategy Edition IN SPAAACE.

As someone who doesn't really have a head for strategy, my only option for getting through this is probably going to be reading a guide step by step in order to not mess leveling my ships up, and that just isn't fun.\n\nIt's still a recommendation because, as I said, I don't have a head for strategy.  If you do, you might have a lot more fun with this one.  As it is, I kind of wish I could turn on training-wheels mode for battles and get back to making decisions and talking to characters.","September 23, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I liked the gameplay, the design, the story. I think its definitely worth a try. If you like a turn based strategy game with a well developed story you'll probably enjoy this game. The cons of this game would be its tendency to lag due to tons of animations for actions which is fun at first but becomes repetitive and you wish you can skip, which you somewhat can but not completely which slows down the game. However, overall i think its a solid game that needs some slight program updates but definitely worth the once over.","September 1, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One - It's turn based so any one who doesnt like turn based just keep clicking away. two - i know theres people who dont like anime style story lines so this might not be for you. Three - The drawings are not the best i've seen but still not bad. Four - It's still alittle buggy in the way that while in combat the game kind of freezes but jumps back in after a few seconds. "no crashes yet"\nOk so now for the pros. Mecha..... I love mecha! so that blew my mind away first. The turn based is not bad at all, i like it. It gives it a real strategy feel because one wrong move can change the battle in a heart beat. The upgrade system covers all the basic needs and then some. "I just wish you could get alittle more money after each level" The story line is stright anime and gives you choices that has a big effect on the out come.\nI all i'm really liking this game. It seems like it's going to be a kind of short game but i will find out soon enough.","September 1, 2014","true","7.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After finishing the first two chapters I can say with confidence that this is a simple yet very fun game that the developers deserve a round of applause for. Its not without flaws and by no means is it perfect but it delivers a story that is fun to play through, a combat system that is simple yet challenging, and an upgrade system that rewards you for making differing choices.\n\nPROS:\n-Good story fits the game very well and does what it needs to do\n(not anything revolutionary, but hey that doesnt mean its bad)\n-Suprisingly good art and animated sequences\n-Simple yet challenging combat system\n-Great soundtrack really outstanding guys\n-R&D system I felt was very rewarding if you allocated money properly (upgrades arent meaningless)\n-Story choices i expect will play a bigger role in the last chapter but there are some in the first two that effect things without taking enjoyment out of the game\n-Save/load system simple which allows player to explore different options\n-FREE!!!!\n\nCONS:\n-Everything I could put here is going to come along with the final chapter\n-For Example: I want more game to play, wish choices impacted more, oh and also i want more game to play\n\nTo sum things up i was bummed when i finished the first two chapters because i really wanted to continue playing the game, (I played through it twice). The thing that shocks me about this game though is that its free while at the same time being better then so many other games on steam. Definitely check this game out worst case you dont like it and delete it, but the developers made a story they wanted to make and it shows. I truly applaud their hard work and can't wait to see more from them (please continue making games).","November 24, 2014","true","54.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no pay to win or pay for cosmetics content.\n\nIf you have thought that visual novels were only "weird porn games from Japan" this is the game for you to try.\n\nNow about the game. It is a visual novel interpersed with tactical hex based mech and spaceship battles. The story is suprisingly good, if rather silly and animesque. Girls are cute but some of the personalities are a bit too archetypal, if you understand what words: Tsundere, class president, genki girl and a Rei clone mean you will be very satisfied. The game doesn´t have any "excessivelly romantic" content in the steam version. The music is also great and fits the game perfectly. The same cannot unfortunately said about voice acting (combat only), but having any in a 40 000$ indie game is amazing.\n\nThe main gameplay of the game is a turn and hex based spaceship and mech combat simulator, think gundam but you on the commanders seat. It could be compared to Fire Emblem or advance wars. Every girl has a unique mech and you need to balance their actions accurately to win the battles. expect about 10-15hrs for a playthrough.\n\nAll in all a positive suprise of a game, but still a work in progress. The game currently covers 2 out of 3 chapters, and a final release is predicted somewhere in the spring 2015. The game doesn´t have any game breaking bugs and has a small but helpfull dev-team. Definatly worth your time unless you are critically allergic to anime and related tropes.\n\n8/10\nGood:\nExcelent battle engine\nMechs\nGirls\nUpgrade system\nFeels like a good light hearted mecha-anime.\nMusic\n\nBad:\nSome balance issues in battles.\nVoice acting is somewhat bad.\nNeeds more sidequests.\n\n","November 10, 2014","true","49.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Keeping that in mind, this is one of (if not THE) best visual novels I've read/played.  Loved it.\n\nOkay... where to begin?\n\nFirst... I read one of the reviews that said this was beta.  There's one typo I caught... and yes, the battles in regular mode (and above) can be hard.  HARD.  But... it's a visual novel with a game inside it... you can set the difficulty downwards if you need to.  So... I can't really say it's unbalanced... it's balanced for being a nut-kickingly difficult fight.  Unless, you know... you don't want to work that hard and you choose to set it easier... in which case it ranges from much more friendly all the way down to why-do-we-even-have-battles-if-they're-that-easy?\n\nSo it's not unbalanced... there's a type I caught... and... um... yeah.  That's it.  If this is beta, sign me up!\n\nNow... this is, first and formost, a visual novel... meaning READING!  You has to do it!  If you don't like reading narrative, you will hate this game.  If you think you can just skip to the good parts... you will still hate this game.\n\nIf you're actually willing to read every line of text (and this is a looooong game... I spent 20 hours on my first playthrough) then you will probably dig this as much as I did.\n\nCharacters are shallow... but not two-dimensional... they grow, they expand, they have REASONS for being who and what they are.  You get to know them... and you get to like them.  Investment in this story is easy and rewarding.\n\nAlso: I'M FIRIN' MAH LAZORS!\n\nStill laugh everytime I hear that.  Sorry... where was I?\n\nOh, yes... story.\n\nIs it predictable?  Yes.  Don't expect some Lanister twist here, but at the same time it's not Lost where you'll be wondering what the heck REALLY happened.  It's a good, fundamentally anime story... with girls in skintight suits and giant mecha... love interests from all directions (but not the cheesy, "I'll just date you all" male fantasy wank you might expect to find after the relationships start peeking out from behind the curtains)... and it does all of these tropes and more justice.\n\nNow for some reason, I got to play it for free.  I have NO idea what that's about, and if your milage varies, well... I can say I'd have happily paid for this in hindsight.  $5?  Absolutely.  $10?  Probably.  More than that?  Hmm... hard to say.  There's not a lot of branches here... and they usually loop back to the same place.  Most people won't find a reason to replay it.  But honestly... for a good evening's worth (or two) of anime fun?  It's good.  Really good.\n\nFinal rating: best VN I've read yet.  All teh thumbs up!","October 6, 2014","true","24.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And so it happens that our protagonist must become the hero who will stop PACT little by little with just one ship. Sounds cliched at first but there are interesting twists along the way.\n\n- Characters: Harem! All the girls have common anime personalities, like the tsundere, the super serious, the shy, the silent and misterious and so on and so forth. In spite of this fact, there is quite a lot of character development, specially towards the end.\n\n- Choices: The choices you are forced to make in this game also contribute to give personality to the main protagonist, since you can be a "save the universe at all costs" kind of guy or have a "we won't sacrifice innocents" attitude. I'm not sure the choices have a huge impact in the long run, but they definetly change battles and make the game more compelling.\n\n- Soundtrack: I must say that I wasn't impressed by the first tracks I got to hear when starting the game, but later on there sure is great music, specially during crucial points of the story.\n\nThe not so great:\n\n- Voice acting: hit and miss. Some are just too annoying. You only get to hear it during battles though.\n\n- Difficulty: battles are VERY hard in this game. The developers said that it's hard for a reason, after all you are trying to save the universe with just one ship. There are hard games which feel rewarding, but here I think it's just artificially difficult. It IS a tactical game, you have to know your units and use them wisely, but sometimes I feel like there isn't much I can do except pray for some good RNG and abuse saving and loading. Resources are finite, so if you think your upgrades are wrong, that's it. You can't fight random battles to become stronger. You have to win with what's in your hands right now. On the other hand, if you feel like the combat is too difficult for you, or if you just want to enjoy the nice story, you can lower the difficulty down to "Visual Novel". Doing that makes the combat just a formality which you can easily win. There is no penality at all for doing this, you won't miss anything.\n\nThe negative:\n\n- The engine. Renpy clearly wasn't made for this kind of game. The performance is awful on the battlefield and during combat animations. Seems like I'm using a very bad computer, but I'm not!\n\nOther comments:\n- This game is completely free. It was crowd funded through Kickstarter.\n\n- The story isn't complete, it'll be finished later. Right now it ends in a cliffhanger.\n\n- This isn't a "choose your girl" erotic visual novel. I think there is only 1 sex scene in the whole game, and you have to apply the Decensor patch that can be found here "http://sunrider-vn.com/sunriderpage/" to see it. I do recommend you apply it.","March 15, 2015","true","18.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Has surprising depth from a F2P Visual Novel. I wasn't really expecting a shockingly passable Turn-based combat space-sim, so I'd almost give it a thumbs-up on that alone. Solid soundtrack, too\n\nLonger version: In truth, the characters are predictable anime-waifu trope material. There's the one with boobs who wants your junk. The shy one, etc etc. They say the same 2 or 3 lines over and over again in the combat sequences and they essentially all have the same model, just with different-colored hair/outfit that matches their Gundam-wing-type ship. They do have their own personalities and motivations and decent depth to the character. Be nice to see another male character that isn't a pompous ♥♥♥-wad/scheming d-bag/not blatantly evil, though. The villains of the game are uninteresting to the extreme and seemed to follow a Do-it-Yourself Build-an-Evil-Empire coloring book from Wal-Mart. That'd be the game's biggest drawback.\n\nThat being said, the plot and combat for a Visual novel is good. The Waifu-stuff is there and if it really matters to to, you get to see a boob. Not bad for a free to play game. The game is still in the beta stages, so there are still bugs present, although I have not encountered anything gamebreaking. The harder difficulties are definitely a challenge, so that's a point in its favor as well\n\nLooking forward to the final chapter","March 4, 2015","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It initially seemed a bit slow and tedious, but then I found out that you can speed up enemy animations by holding down the CTRL button.\n\nThis is not the greatest game I've ever played, but it's definitely one of the most enjoyable. In spite of myself, I really came to care a lot about the characters. They're anime stereotypes, one and all, but that didn't detract from the experience. The game managed to make them charming and likable.\n\nTo me, the biggest and most pleasant surprise was that the story was actually worth experiencing in itself, rather than being just an excuse to fight in space and ogle pretty women. The combat difficulty can be decreased at any time, and in fact, I'd recommend most players to do that so they can enjoy the story without getting frustrated by the combat, which poses a significant challenge, even at the medium "Captain" level. You face strategic, moral and personal choices, all of which will apparently play out in Part 3, which is due out in the first half of this year.\n\nThe game was and will be free, thanks to Kickstarter backers, but I would have happily paid money for this. Here's to Love in Space -- I'm expecting great things from them in the future.","January 19, 2015","true","106.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There is no pay to win or pay for cosmetics content.\n\nIf you have thought that visual novels were only "weird porn games from Japan" this is the game for you to try.\n\nNow about the game. It is a visual novel interpersed with tactical hex based mech and spaceship battles. The story is suprisingly good, if rather silly and animesque. Girls are cute but some of the personalities are a bit too archetypal, if you understand what words: Tsundere, class president, genki girl and a Rei clone mean you will be very satisfied. The game doesn´t have any "excessivelly romantic" content in the steam version. The music is also great and fits the game perfectly. The same cannot unfortunately said about voice acting (combat only), but having any in a 40 000$ indie game is amazing.\n\nThe main gameplay of the game is a turn and hex based spaceship and mech combat simulator, think gundam but you on the commanders seat. It could be compared to Fire Emblem or advance wars. Every girl has a unique mech and you need to balance their actions accurately to win the battles. expect about 10-15hrs for a playthrough.\n\nAll in all a positive suprise of a game, but still a work in progress. The game currently covers 2 out of 3 chapters, and a final release is predicted somewhere in the spring 2015. The game doesn´t have any game breaking bugs and has a small but helpfull dev-team. Definatly worth your time unless you are critically allergic to anime and related tropes.\n\n8/10\nGood:\nExcelent battle engine\nMechs\nGirls\nUpgrade system\nFeels like a good light hearted mecha-anime.\nMusic\n\nBad:\nSome balance issues in battles.\nVoice acting is somewhat bad.\nNeeds more sidequests.\n\n","November 10, 2014","true","49.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

One - It's turn based so any one who doesnt like turn based just keep clicking away. two - i know theres people who dont like anime style story lines so this might not be for you. Three - The drawings are not the best i've seen but still not bad. Four - It's still alittle buggy in the way that while in combat the game kind of freezes but jumps back in after a few seconds. "no crashes yet"\nOk so now for the pros. Mecha..... I love mecha! so that blew my mind away first. The turn based is not bad at all, i like it. It gives it a real strategy feel because one wrong move can change the battle in a heart beat. The upgrade system covers all the basic needs and then some. "I just wish you could get alittle more money after each level" The story line is stright anime and gives you choices that has a big effect on the out come.\nI all i'm really liking this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClipOnSunglasses/recommended/313730/","ClipOnSunglasses","ClipOnSunglasses","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ClipOnSunglasses/","52 products in account","Summary: If you wanted Mass Effect to be a Tactics RPG and Animu as all ♥♥♥♥ then this is your game. Surprising level of depth, aside from not having all the episodes released (so incomplete in story/content but complete in terms of game mechanics), I can only nitpick and it's completely free (zero microtransactions, but the final chapter will cost money to anyone who did not back the kickstarter).\n\nI wanted to try this game out because the thing I liked most about playing Mass Effect and Telltale's The Walking Dead was not the shooting or QTEs, but having a group of likeable characters you interact with, getting to know more about them through conversations and making difficult choices that can affect them for better or for worse. Not to deny that the white haired sniper chick wasn't also part of the reason why. :3c\nI have to say, the plot was surprisingly good, and the especially ending was very memorable, the characters are likeable enough, the lore is fairly interesting. The choices are morally ambiguious and they did a good job at making me really think about what I wanted to do, though I can't tell how much of an impact they really have on the storyline. Though I do want to point out that the opening narration is a bit stupid. It isn't a big deal because it does not have much affect on the plot, but to say that humans have subjugated (their words, not mine) all alien in life in the galaxy, then saying that PACT is bad because they are conquering the other human planets is a bit hypocritical.\nThe combat is also surprisngly enjoyable, I'm not an expert of TRPGs so maybe it is not the best, but I felt it had enough depth to be enjoyable. The Mechs (Ryders) are very diverse, have unique mechanics and I wouldn't say any of them are useless even if their roles may overlap at times (support, anti-ship, anti-ryder), they all do their roles differently. The kinetic/energy/missile damage types make for interesting tactical choices; do I want to sit back safely with accurate but weak energy weapons? Or close in and rely on kinetic but eat plenty of shots I might have otherwise evaded? Do I shoot my devasting but limited use missiles towards the front line to reduce the interception chance, or target the flagship in the back with the knowledge that I will be using my missiles in an ineffiecent manner as the enemies they bypass will increase the chance of my enemy shooting down the missile salvo? Do I want to use a melee Ryder to ohko an enemy Ryder if it means giving my enemy a free attack by getting with their "counter attack" range?\nAlso, having some attacks have multiple shots with their individual calculations to hit and armor/shield reduction being per shot made the difference between a rapid fire kinetic assault rifle and a single shot kinetic cannon important, as they can do more damage per turn in different scenarios rather than one being directly better than the other. For example, a heavily armored oponent will absorb plentiful weak shots, and at long range multiple shots spreads out the risk of missing a shot at the offset of lesser damage potential.\nI do want to say that the upgrade system is a bit weird, if I put points into one and try to take them back, I don't get all of my money, but I didn't know I was immediately buying the upgrades because it looked like I would have to "confirm" my upgrades beforehand if I could immediately remove them. So save because you upgrade as to not accidentally spend money on the wrong upgrades. Some, like effiency for weapon types, seems like a useless until you put a lot of cash into it and upgrade your energy storage. While it was very useful in the later game, as I could get two shots with my powerful weapons instead of just one each turn with the right mix of lowered cost and higher energy per turn. But it was almost pointless at the start to get those upgrades. But again, not a huge deal as long as you plan ahead.\nThe only big critique is that not all of the "episodes" have released yet, but even then, that just means some people might want to wait until all of them are out before they start it.","January 9, 2015","true","33.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nothing deal-breaking, but simple repetitive things.  Like being able to hear the click of Asaga's VA releasing her PTT.\nTHAT SAID:\n\nThose are two of my three only complaints.  I loved it.  The story is riveting and characters are fantastically loveable.  The soundtrack is wonderfully fitting.  And for such a simplistic and intuitive system, the combat mechanics are actually very complex and demanding of some thought.  I found myself actually having to plan out my expenditures for research and fleet composition in order to be able to best tackle the enemy using my preferred strategy.  The animations, while simplistic, are certainly immersive.  The AI can occasionally even pull out some interesting tactics that force me out of my usual strategy.  It was certainly the most entertaining 25 hours I've spent in a game in the past 6 months at least.\nIn fact, I could even say I had FUN.  Which is a refreshing experience these days.\n\nAnd of course, the most important part of any game, the real keystone of any enjoyable gaming experience: Were there any moments that truly stood out, that will jump to the forefront of my memory any time I think of the game, ones which instill in me a sense of excitement and desire to jump right back into the game?\n\n"This is my command: prepare to fire the Vanguard cannon!

It's free. So you've got nothing to lose by trying it! But be warned, it's still not "complete" as there's still one more chapter to come out. Think of it as the A New Hope and the Empire Strikes Back.\n\nBut onto the actual meat and potatoes now...\n\nIf I had to describe Sunrider, I'd say that it'd be what you get if Valkyria Chronicles, FTL, X-COM and Ah! My Goddess got SUPER drunk one night and did some things they will probably never speak of to each other. Well, their loss is our gain. Sunrider is an epic space opera about you Kayto "Captain" Shields trying to defeat an evil empire that has been blasting people up for no good reason. You're given a newly commissioned sweet ♥♥♥ battlestar called the Sunrider (which is pretty much an expy for the Space Battleship Yamato) which you can take into combat and a bunch of insanely giant mecha that you gradually fill up your hangar with. Of course, this being a visual novel in the best anime style all the mecha pilots are waifus. You could pretty much list off exactly who you'll be getting, the hyper-kinetic one, the quiet one, the shy one, the cold badass that is sensitive on the inside and the one you have history with. While this could have been used as a set up for simply some massive amounts of T&A (and there is some) the devs actually put together a great story with these characters. By the end of it, you'll have saved a few planets, gone to a creepy alien graveyard, helped out some local miners, crashed a wedding and (of course) gone on shore leave which fans of anime will immediately recognize as "The Beach Episode". Sure some of this might seems like TVTropes fodder, but they manage to stich it together into a great narrative, complete with drama, romance and a helpful smacking of comedy. But in addition to the cutesy covering, this game explores some fairly dark themes like collateral damage, betrayal and slavery. All of these are explored in the Visual Novel side of the gameplay where you can wander around your ship and talk to your crew.\n\nWhile the visual novel style of gameplay is satisfying, the meat of the game is in the combat. Here, the turn based style of X-COM is fully utilized. You get a hex grid with the baddies on one side and your forces on the other. Each unit has a set number of "Energy" that is used up when it does things like activate special abilities, move and fire weapons. The Sunrider is often the anchor of the formation and has an array of extremely powerful weapons like lasers (weak but accurate), kinetic cannons (powerful but inaccurate) and missiles (powerful and accurate but limited salvoes and can be shot down). There are also a couple of special abilities that you can use like the wave motion gun, resurrection of an ally and so forth. Backing you up are the numerous Ryders that are essentially fighter jets to your carrier. But, as this is anime, no one wants to see boring old space fighters, and the Ryders are all special mecha. Each Ryder (piloted by one of the aforementioned waifus) has a specific role, strengths and weaknesses. The Black Jack, for example, is a general purpose combat unit designed to soak up and dish out damage while the Seraphim is delicate but can wreck enemy units from long range with a sniper cannon and the Paladin is a mighty glacier. As you can imagine, it takes all your forces working together in order to pull out a victory as you are usually outnumbered. It's elegant and fun, especially those times when you pull off that one low percentage shot to save your girls. Fortunately, even if you mess up a bit, anyone that gets to zero HP (besides YOU of course) pulls back to the carrier and will be available for the next battle. The only annoying bits are some of the combat exclamations which get a little tedious after a while.\n\nIn another nod towards the X-COM and Valkyria Chronicles style, the spoils of victory give you resources which you can use to upgrade your forces such as by increasing their amount of energy, reducing the cost of abilities, making your weapons more powerful and even purchasing some backup. You'll quickly find that there's no way that you'll be able to afford all the upgrades so it becomes a careful balancing act as to where you'll spend your money especially as there's no way to "farm" resources. I would have appreciated a way to get some additionaly cash as currently there is no way to get more than partially up the tech tree for any one unit without nerfing everyone else. Still, if you're wise about your choices and concentrate on each Ryder's strengths, you'll get a formidable fighting machine in the end.\n\nAll in all, Sunrider is a great game and needs to get a sequel pronto. I'm dying to know how all this madness ends. Love In Space is yet to release the final chapter of the game but you can bet that I'm going to be first in line to get my hands on it!\n","April 13, 2015","true","32.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I first bought that game and noticed all the in-game references to this game (but also missed a lot). Anyway, I got interested and downloaded. This game is so good that it wiped out my disappointment with Sunrider Academy. I even didn’t pay full price for that one. But if it pays the salary of the devs so they can make games like this, I totally can live with it.\nThe characters were clearly made for this novel. They  felt out of place in Academy. I think that’s because  in Academy they are children who act like adults and here they are adults who (sometimes) act like children. That also explains why they are funny from the start where in academy they could be annoying (Chigara’s bakery, Ava’s uptightness though well explained, Sola’s solitude) You also should check out in the bonus the reaction of the ladies to the polls. Very funny\nThe main choice in the game is a classic big one. Does the goal justify the means. Kudos for not making it an easy one. It kept me pondering for a while over some what ifs in history (20th century of course).\nThe battle parts are challenging and not in my mind repetitive like the managing in Academy (Although I accepted that as part of the high school experience).\nNow I’m hooked and I even haven’t finished the game once.","July 24, 2015","true","16.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes so far I have seen one nice set of boobs, yes for animated they are nice, firm, and fun to look at. ^_^ I really hope I am not near the end of the game now in the story and for the money lettle can compeat.","August 10, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Throughout that, I’ve crashed the game countless times (mostly through a save/load prompt causing it to look for a missing animation file, or skipping battle scenes and somehow causing it to crash from there). That said, the whole thing could still be improved, from the interface, to the fluidity of the system, to the behavior of the AI — pretty much everything can still take a touching up.\n\nRegardless, it was and is a pretty good game. I enjoyed it and the challenge it gave - Captain: Way the game is meant to be played; much harder than I thought it’d be for the ‘suggested’ setting - and would invite you to try it out. The story is nothing special, but it’s definitely good for what it is.\n\nThis has a lot of potential!","March 23, 2015","true","16.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are plenty of flaws here that would break a commercial game, but for a free game, it's strengths outweigh it's frustrations. Yes, it's a freeware game, by the way. No tricks.\n\nSo what have we got in the VN side? A harem story that paints it's characters in broad strokes, doesn't branch out much in terms of individual heroines, has pretty generic and partially unfinished looking visuals (some of the menu's repurpose the concept art scetches) and that really doesn't stray far from the tropes of a regular "band of misfits rises up against evil" story. However, the story does do a good job of keeping you invested enough in the battles, does a very good job of tying the gameplay and story together, and all of the cliches and tropes are executed well enough to be entertaining. The story borrows heavily from a dozen space and mecha shows, but doesn't dumb down it's narrative, and generally understands whaty makes these kinds of stories interesting. The game also doesn't force it's exposition down your throat when you don't want to read it, and generally proceeds at a good pace. So storywise, there's nothing too bad here, but nothing you haven't seen before.\n\nThe tactical combat is... ande interesting mixed bag. The game uses a hex-based grid in which you command your units, ships and mechas ("Ryders", in this game) around the board, trying to choose the right unit and weapon for each enemy target. On one hand, it's really badly done at a technical level, with janky, very basic still animations that require you to actually click to advance the animation, and take forever to play out. I actually managed to crash the game in the first mission, by accidentally queing up an action while another battle-animation was playing. However, the combat system itself is very fun, forcing you to try to min-max your squad use, and find the correct weapons to wipe out as much as you can each turn. The combat system itself is reasonably strong, but the way it's used holds it back at times. For one, the game is very unforgiving on the default difficulty. On one mission, I was forced to pilot a squad of three units, one of them a support, against an entire army of stronger units spawning from the mission's objective. Another time, a mission objective that couldn't be moved was surrounded by enemy units, that could destroy it on turn one. Compared to some other games in the genre, there is a ridiculous ammount of trial and error involved with this game, and I don't blame anyone for starting on one of the lower settings. at one point, I had to play an hour of gameplay again to re-upgrade my ship, so I could deal with a particular mission. Incidentally, the upgrade system is  pretty simple, menu based one, mostly just providing stat-upgrades. It gives a lot of choices in upgrading, though, so I like it.\n\n"Competent" is the word I would use to describe this game. The next game in the series is going to be commercial, and I expect the developers to take the lessons from this game and apply them to deliver something that is worth paying for. Cleaner menu's and backrounds, more flowing gameplay, spit, polish and bugfixing.\n\n","January 24","true","15.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has a wide range of dificulties to choose from. The default dificulty is quite chalenging and rewarding. The game isn't finished at the time of this review.\nSunrider offers a wide range of choices that affect what kind of mission you will face and how your ships a positioned.\nThe game is set in a cold war between the reds and the the republic union. The protagonist is from a neutral planet that is atacked by the reds and from there is given to the player moral choices between sabotaging the reds and saving people from pirates and human traffickers. Until now choices dont seem to have impact in the overall story except the last one from the mask of arcadius chapter.\nSide missions in the game are few and far between, because of that money is scarce in the default dificulty so upgrading your ship is dificult. I had problems because the game doesn´t explain fully how the combat works, for example damaging a ship also reduces the armor, i like the detail but it took me a while to get it because the a game has a reasonable number of stasts and it would be helpfull if they had something explaining besides the hints in the dialogue in the initial battles.\nI recomend the game because it has a good story with some funny moments and the combat is quite challenging and enjoyable.","November 30, 2014","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Amazing story, coupled with excellent gameplay and amazing feel. I went in expecting another boring dating sim (only really tried the game for the giant robits) and was far more than pleasantly surprised. From firing the Sunrider's "Vanguard Cannon" (A axial superlaser the just wreaks absolute havoc on enemy lines), to cackling as enemy missiles and torpedoes are shot out of the sky by my heavy flak, the gameplay just feels spot on. It's like if we actually got a Gundam tactics game that told it's own story instead of either rehashing the usual plotlines or copying one of the shows scene for scene.\n\nThe storytelling absolutely blew me away. This game includes parts one and two of the series, with part 3 "Liberation Day" well on the way. And boy oh boy, am I excited for that to land, because of - Well, I'm not going to spoil it for you! Suffice to say, the game's story can stand among the giants of space opera and hold it's own, which says a lot for it. Some scenes will make you cry, others will tear you apart. When this game gets dark and gritty, ho boy get ready, you're in for an emotional rollercoaster ride of sadness and depression, and some loathing of humanity, Even the social commentary common to many Sci-Fi series makes several appearances.\n\nGameplay is smooth and difficulty ranges from sailing through the wreckage of your opponents on a casual stroll through the plot to tearing your hair out and cursing at your screen as half your team gets wiped in one turn. Whatever your difficulty preference, Sunrider has it, including a game mode the dev team admits may not even be winnable (this is noted prominently on the mode selection).\n\nOh and the soundtrack. Absolutely stunning main themes, along with wonderful battle music that fits the feel of the setting. While i'm on the subject of the audio, the sound effects are nice and very anime-inspired, and the voiceovers are AMAZING. From Icari yelling at enemies for scratching the paint on her robit, to Asaga declaring "I'ma Firin' Mah Lazer!" the voiceover work is charming and amusing.\n\nBut why are you reading this when you could be PLAYING??

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rumdumconundrum/recommended/313730/","rumdumconundrum","Otaku Bell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rumdumconundrum/","164 products in account","The characters, while all conforming to the typical anime stereotypes (the genki girl, the shy one, the tsundere, the perv with questionable morals, the silent and mysterious one, the business-y one), still work work really well off of each otherr. The art is superb, and the dialogue can be really entertaining at times.\n\nThe story's unique and well thought-out, with valid questions being asked of the player. What should be sacrificed in the name of a greater victory? Do the ends justify the means to stop a horrible evil?\n\nPlus, there might be space whales, and that's a BIG plus from me. Why? Because space whales are awesome.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis game, however, is not without its flaws:\n\nThe combat, unfortunately, is one of my least favorite aspects of the game (which is bad, because that's a huge part of the game). I've played (and beaten) the Advance Wars games, so I'm not a newbie to turn-based tactical RPGs, but there's some severe imbalance in the combat. The developers stated that this is intentional, as you're supposed to be a lone pilot fighting off a heavily-armed empire; however, I've had attacks that should have a 100% chance of hitting the opponent miss, and I've had stealthed characters still get attacked while stealthed. Granted, this is still a game being patched, so these might be fixed soon.\n\nI'm also not too fond of the combat mechanics as a whole. Most of your turns will involve scanning through each character, highlighting each of their abilites, and seeing which will have a better chance of hitting the enemy you're trying to attack (when the game even bothers to show the correct hit percentage). I've never seen a game successfully pull off having every attack have a different (seemingly random) chance of hitting the opponent and not have it be aggravating. A game like this should be based on skill, not chance.\n\nCould you also give us some indication of the enemy's attack range as well? Please? I don't particularly like thinking I'm doing really well, then getting absolutely nuked by a bombardment of kinetic fire because I had no idea I was close enough to be hit.\n\nAlso, the missles are a huge source of headaches. I decided to do an experiment, and saved right before I fired a rocket so I could test something. As I soon found, some of the times, all of the rockets were intercepted by flak (the game's only way of deflecting 100% accuracy rockets), and sometimes NONE of them were. So, once again, the game's combat comes down to chance and luck. Good luck having Icari survive being on the front lines for more than one turn before being nuked to oblivion!\n\nThe upgrades for ships are far too small and too pricey to make any noticable difference. Money runs out far too quickly for each upgrade, and as such, you're going to have two or three of your Ryders being underdeveloped if you want your others to be remotely competent.\n\nThe game has a system for "command points", which are points you earn for your performance in missions which you can spend during battles for large buffs or special effects for a short period of time (as well as use for special dialogue options), but there were many times I tried to trigger one, only for nothing to happen. I don't mean that I don't know what they were supposed to do, or that I did them wrong, but that the intended effect DID NOT HAPPEN, which is especially galling due to the fact that the menu for spending the command points disappears when one of them is still in effect. So, basically, I had used the points, had a battle-duration cooldown, and had none of the buffs to show for it. This happened several times throughout my playthrough.\n\nThe aforementioned character archetypes get tiresome in combat. There's only so many times I can hear Asaga say "I'm A-FIRING MAH LAZOR!" before I want to cave her skull in with a tent peg. First off, you couldn't find a meme more... recent? Secondly, how exactly does she know about that? Does ♥♥♥♥♥ exist in that universe? Also, Icari's "What?! I'm not doing this because I like you!" when you select her is not only awkward, but also gets rather tiresome after hearing it for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe villains are almost cartoonishly evil. There's little question that the main villain's the kind of guy who probably funded his takeover of the galaxy by stealing money from his sickly mother, setting their house on fire (with his parents still in the house) for the insurance money, getting guardianship of his underage sister (whom he frequently molests), and then having her work as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for his amusement and profit. Before one of the last battles, the villain speaks to his fleet, and rallies them with a speech about how the Alliance is evil and full of bureaucrats who sit in their ivory towers while others starve. After I read this, I was hoping that there'd be some depth to the villains, maybe have them have a legitimate cause for attempting to take over the galaxy, but then I remembered how he also beats one of the main females, whom he kidnapped, over the head and talks about breaking her and bending her to his will, making her want nothing more than to "service" him. So, yeah, all he needs is a Snidely Whiplash moustache he can twirl while tying her to the train tracks and laughing maniacally.\n\n------------------------------\n\nMy recommendation is to turn the difficulty down to visual novel level in the options, enjoy the writing of the main characters, and think of this as more of an interactive story than a tactical RPG.\n\nIs the story fun? Yes.\n\nAre the characters good? When you can't hear them, yes.\n\nIs the gameplay good? Eh... *makes noncomittal noises while shrugging*\n\n----------------------------\n\n"Our hull is being fractured!"\n"SHUT UP!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mintzone/recommended/313730/","mintzone","Yousagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mintzone/","415 products in account","This is simply the best Original English language visual novel made as of yet. The characters are likable, the story is a proper story with actual conflict and character development. The combat system is good, though the animations can get a bit tedious at times. You can turn the fights into visual novel mode if combat isn't your thing... The biggest issue with visual novel mode is that, well, you still have to do the fights. I also wish that your choices had more impact on the actual game. Although the game seemed to care about which choices I made in First Arrival, I don't think they really had too much of an impact on the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rumdumconundrum/recommended/313730/","rumdumconundrum","Otaku Bell","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rumdumconundrum/","164 products in account","The characters, while all conforming to the typical anime stereotypes (the genki girl, the shy one, the tsundere, the perv with questionable morals, the silent and mysterious one, the business-y one), still work work really well off of each otherr. The art is superb, and the dialogue can be really entertaining at times.\n\nThe story's unique and well thought-out, with valid questions being asked of the player. What should be sacrificed in the name of a greater victory? Do the ends justify the means to stop a horrible evil?\n\nPlus, there might be space whales, and that's a BIG plus from me. Why? Because space whales are awesome.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nThis game, however, is not without its flaws:\n\nThe combat, unfortunately, is one of my least favorite aspects of the game (which is bad, because that's a huge part of the game). I've played (and beaten) the Advance Wars games, so I'm not a newbie to turn-based tactical RPGs, but there's some severe imbalance in the combat. The developers stated that this is intentional, as you're supposed to be a lone pilot fighting off a heavily-armed empire; however, I've had attacks that should have a 100% chance of hitting the opponent miss, and I've had stealthed characters still get attacked while stealthed. Granted, this is still a game being patched, so these might be fixed soon.\n\nI'm also not too fond of the combat mechanics as a whole. Most of your turns will involve scanning through each character, highlighting each of their abilites, and seeing which will have a better chance of hitting the enemy you're trying to attack (when the game even bothers to show the correct hit percentage). I've never seen a game successfully pull off having every attack have a different (seemingly random) chance of hitting the opponent and not have it be aggravating. A game like this should be based on skill, not chance.\n\nCould you also give us some indication of the enemy's attack range as well? Please? I don't particularly like thinking I'm doing really well, then getting absolutely nuked by a bombardment of kinetic fire because I had no idea I was close enough to be hit.\n\nAlso, the missles are a huge source of headaches. I decided to do an experiment, and saved right before I fired a rocket so I could test something. As I soon found, some of the times, all of the rockets were intercepted by flak (the game's only way of deflecting 100% accuracy rockets), and sometimes NONE of them were. So, once again, the game's combat comes down to chance and luck. Good luck having Icari survive being on the front lines for more than one turn before being nuked to oblivion!\n\nThe upgrades for ships are far too small and too pricey to make any noticable difference. Money runs out far too quickly for each upgrade, and as such, you're going to have two or three of your Ryders being underdeveloped if you want your others to be remotely competent.\n\nThe game has a system for "command points", which are points you earn for your performance in missions which you can spend during battles for large buffs or special effects for a short period of time (as well as use for special dialogue options), but there were many times I tried to trigger one, only for nothing to happen. I don't mean that I don't know what they were supposed to do, or that I did them wrong, but that the intended effect DID NOT HAPPEN, which is especially galling due to the fact that the menu for spending the command points disappears when one of them is still in effect. So, basically, I had used the points, had a battle-duration cooldown, and had none of the buffs to show for it. This happened several times throughout my playthrough.\n\nThe aforementioned character archetypes get tiresome in combat. There's only so many times I can hear Asaga say "I'm A-FIRING MAH LAZOR!" before I want to cave her skull in with a tent peg. First off, you couldn't find a meme more... recent? Secondly, how exactly does she know about that? Does ♥♥♥♥♥ exist in that universe? Also, Icari's "What?! I'm not doing this because I like you!" when you select her is not only awkward, but also gets rather tiresome after hearing it for the umpteenth time.\n\nThe villains are almost cartoonishly evil. There's little question that the main villain's the kind of guy who probably funded his takeover of the galaxy by stealing money from his sickly mother, setting their house on fire (with his parents still in the house) for the insurance money, getting guardianship of his underage sister (whom he frequently molests), and then having her work as a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for his amusement and profit. Before one of the last battles, the villain speaks to his fleet, and rallies them with a speech about how the Alliance is evil and full of bureaucrats who sit in their ivory towers while others starve. After I read this, I was hoping that there'd be some depth to the villains, maybe have them have a legitimate cause for attempting to take over the galaxy, but then I remembered how he also beats one of the main females, whom he kidnapped, over the head and talks about breaking her and bending her to his will, making her want nothing more than to "service" him. So, yeah, all he needs is a Snidely Whiplash moustache he can twirl while tying her to the train tracks and laughing maniacally.\n\n------------------------------\n\nMy recommendation is to turn the difficulty down to visual novel level in the options, enjoy the writing of the main characters, and think of this as more of an interactive story than a tactical RPG.\n\nIs the story fun? Yes.\n\nAre the characters good? When you can't hear them, yes.\n\nIs the gameplay good? Eh... *makes noncomittal noises while shrugging*\n\n----------------------------\n\n"Our hull is being fractured!"\n"SHUT UP!

No catch aligned!\n\nSecond: The story is designed for many chapters (three at least). Included are chapter one "First arrival" and two "Mask of Arcadius". The next chapter is in development, private-beta is limited to baker on kickstarter/patreon. There seams to be quite some work to be done, so no TBA (sadly, can't wait!). It is announced NOT as a free update.\n\nThird: The game is a mix of visual novel and roundbased strategic fights.\n\nThe story is quite well written even though many cliché's are used. Every character of your group has more to her than the cliché she is based on. "her" and "she" because: Every significant person on your ship (bar yourself) is female. Most unlogical, but apparently in this universe there are only female freelancer-ryder-pilots.\n\nThe gameplay:\nThe VN part just works fine. Nothing special to say about, with the exception: You can fully backroll the current scene, and thus you can also undo your choices. Not that this would matter too much, only few decisions have some influence on the next fight, and the way it looks only one choice near the end has some influence on the story afterwards (if i didn't miss anything).\nThe battle-part... Let's just say it is NOT easy. The description of the difficulties is exactly right: The default mode "Captain" is a challenge and I did play on the "Ensign" as I dont like to redo every battle many times. There are only two difficulties above "Captain", and the highest is not guarenteed as being winable. When you're not interested in the battles or are extremely bad (like me in my youth), the easiest difficulty "Visual Novel mode" is made for you.\nThe battles take place on a a hex-based grid, per turn every ship has some amount of energy, which is used for every action of it. Because of the story you start with only your ship and get more units under your command over the story, and as missile-coverage and shields cover adjacent cells too, the positioning gets more important over time, also increasing the fun I got out of it.\n\nOverall I had much fun with this game and strongly recommend it. And as it's free, you can just start downloading without needing to wait for payment.

I, like many of the other kickstarter backers for this game, didn't back this game for it's combat systems, though they were interesting; I backed the game for it's promise of a sweeping space opera, what we have received is not that. The story is barely there (try playing with dev cheats on and skip the battles, the story takes just a fraction of the normal time) the characters feel like cardboard cut outs and the combat is so clunky and boring it just saps all enthusiasm for the rest of the game. I can no longer recommend this game in this state or any state that follows this path, only a rewrite of the game from the end of part one could possibly save it now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal, now out of date review.\n\nDon't let my complete lack of gameplay time fool you, as a Kickstarter backer for Sunrider I've been playing various versions of Sunrider since the first demo last year. The current beta version of the game has around 10 hours worth of content split between turn based combat and visual novel sections. The Visual Novel sections work as expected of a typical Japanese VN with the occasional choices that can change outcomes or allow you to learn more about your enemies or the lore. The Turn based combat sections put you in command of the Sunrider and various Ryders (big robots). Each Ryder has it's own weapons and abilities and while learning what each one does can be a pain (the lack of tooltips is being worked on) once you've mastered them you'll be a force to be reckoned with. The turn based combat also includes voice acting by professional and amatuer voice actors and actresses. Combat difficulty is still being worked on but at the moment ranges from super easy in the form of "Visual Novel" difficulty to the very difficult "Hard" difficulty. I must also make note of the amazing soundtrack which makes each and every moment of the game feel amazing.\n\nNote: Keep in mind that the game is still in a beta state and could still include bugs.\n\nFor the Sensitive Gamer: Sunrider includes some brief sexual content and nudity, if you're offended by these things, you've been warned. While the content is minimal in this version of the game, it will become more prominent in later versions, however an "all ages" version is planned for eventual release.","July 9, 2014","false","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

I am a huge fan of anime and stuff, but this was taking it to a whole new level....still, for the sake of this review, I shall maintain enough professionalism to make a Pro-Con bit. ok, here goes.\n\nPros:\nAmazing ships an' guns an'stuff. LOTSA DAKKA DAKKA!!!!\nRealistic-yet-dreamable cast. they all have as much depth and background as you care to look into.\nThe main protagonist is so relatable, it felt like I was in his position, saying and doing almost everything he did in his place.\nThe story was very well-done.\nIt has challenge, which, in my opinion, is a Pro. I enjoy fair tests of my strategic skill.\nIt has choices, which I adore the ability to fine-tune the path that the story takes.\nIt is NOT pay-to-win. hell, there IS NO microtransaction system at all! it's JUST a game, no strings attached!\nIt's free to play, free to download, and runs well.\n\nCons:\nThe animations sucked. the characters and ryders/ships were all 2-d drawings that had limited motion and low depth. to be fair, it doesn't really matter so much, but as a part-time animator, It nags at me.\nThey tried to over-adulterise certain parts. I don't mind a little bit of spice now and then, especially considering that it's an anime thing, so you kinda expect that, but there is one instance of nudity, as well as a scene on the beach where.....I'll let the imagination do the talking on that one. it's not THAT bad, except for that one instance of unnecessary nudity.\nFor some people, this would be a con, but personally I don't mind the limited voice-acting. The fact that they have limited voice acting leaves more for the imagination to do, which is an easily-accomplished boon for me at least.\nAlmost no sidequests. NEEDS MORE!!!\nNeeds to be longer. I beat this game after about 12 hrs. still, I have yet to try the high-difficulty levels.

While there are lower difficulty levels, the default setting is quite brutal and will punish illogical investments and particularly faulty tactics. It plays a lot like a Super Robot Wars game, although there is not much animation and there are fewer, stronger enemies. The graphics are sufficient to get the job done though and the latest update now helpfully shows enemy flak and shield zones on the grid.\n\nThe game doesn't really explain the enemy AI, flak and shield coverage as you go along, so it's worth heading to the wiki for a combat overview as otherwise missiles and lasers can seem hopelessly unfair.  Also be aware that rockets purchased from the mining guild are 1 use only weapons, unlike hired extra ships which stay with your fleet until destroyed.\n\nThe main plus point: it's a completely free space tactics game.","October 8, 2014","true","9.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Don't be distracted by the 2D chess-like gameplay in battles. This game will have you gritting your teeth at whatever small tactical mistake you make.

The story seems childish at the start, however precisely ecause of that it really shows how hard things are for the MC (main Character) as you progress through the story. The gameplay could be considered a formality due to how the story is => they included a "visual novel mode" difficulty for those who are only interested in story - impossible to lose and also impossible difficulties for masochists\n\nStory - 7/10 strong first few hours eased my way into the story. Too many cliches throughout the story for my liking tho and a very strong story towards the end. However it is definatly parts 1 and 2 out of 3 in this trilogy. It has set up a really good stage for the 3rd part which could be amazing. honestly the only shortcoming from my point of view was that at times the MC seemed slightly dumb. Though i think it wouldnt bother most people.\n\nCharacters 8/10 Some of the characters are carbon copies of what you'd expect, there is a "tsudere-chan" and so on. At first it bothered me, but later on in the story when things got more complicated some brilliant characters made appearances. especially the pirates are executed brilliantly. all in all i have to say the mental arc was exellent thanks for that!\n\nGameplay 9/10 I loved the gameplay. Partly because i felt nostalgic since it resembled other games i've played. It is a turn-based strategy game which punishes you mercilessly (if you make the difficulty sadistic). Its been a long time since i've had to go all out, planing, save-scumming, researching intelligently, dying repeatedly and so on. Normally doing this too much would turn most people off, to counter this they made the difficulties changable whenever you want => when your fed up you lower it and rofl stomp te baddies. Truly a great game considering its in a VN.\n\nCGs / Music 6/10 honestly i think this is the weakest link in the game. Which makes the VN feel alive. It made it really feel like a small group of people fed their soul into this, rather than their money. as a result the gameplay is amaing the story is solid and the characters have a lot of thought put into them and when the devs are focused on that (IMO more important stuff) the time consuming boring stuff gets neglected. As a result the Visuals are a bit lacking (but a few of the CGs are really nice!). Most painful for me though was the music. A lot of the time it felt like it was a try hard which was a shame. I would love to see the music improved in the next game! (For the Devs: during the last few hours it would have been great to get my heart pounding to the great story and the sound of music, don't be afraid to be extravagent on the music! In other words the highs and lows dont differ enough in the music for my taste)\n\nOver all i can only recommend this game, its not a full blown Visual Novel with all of the oddities that go with them. Therefor it felt like a great game for people new to Visual Novels and a nice change of pace for the veterans. Its Free so try it!\n\nWho's it for:\npoeple who ponder about "what is War? why do we have Wars?"\nYoung gamers new to Visual Novels\nGamers looking for a challenging Tur-based strategy game\n\nWho's it going to turn off:\npeople who dislike chlichés\nthose who think the world is pink\npeople who go looking for romance (i hope that i can remove this with the release of the 3rd part)\n","November 21, 2015","true","31.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is nice, the characters have actual dimensions and interact with each other, and it can be a very human portrayal.\n\nBut! And there is a but, the combat can be described as 'maddening'. I got to a late-game section, admittedly with screwups, and hit a stone wall even on Normal. Some of the side missions are past completing in terms of ability, and even further than that you won't know until about twenty minutes into a couple that since you didn't knock out A mech/ship so quickly you wind up not being able to do a damn thing about it when you lose. Also? A strategy to warp should involve the fall-back warp BACK. A strategy they teach in-game is a sure-fire way to get your ship down to half health or less in a single turn.\n\nThe visual novel? Written well. A few mistakes here and there, but interesting. The combat? Anything above Ensign (mid-level, basically) you may as well go grab a brick and start smacking yourself in the head with it.\n\nAlso? Was kinda hoping there to actually BE romance. Not just pining. Ending's a bit abrupt as well.","October 26, 2014","false","18.5"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","13","26","0","0"

Never really played much games on renpy so I dunno how it is normally.\nAnd honestly, I'm still surprised the devs made a battle system inside renpy (never saw that before atleast...).\n\nAnyway it's a really nice game and I enjoyed it the whole 20 hour (which is mostly spent on reloading battle saves...) and I even finished it in one sitting. It's also apparently still not finished with the next and last part supposedly coming in 2016, which means moar content and chance for the one true girl to shine. And it's probably not going to be the one I want...\n\n...Sola needs more screentime ;-;\n\nI guess I'll play Academy again for that...","December 11, 2015","true","29.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

During the battle, you might find you can't select your units anymore, forcing you to reload. When you're reading the dialogues, you suddenly get an error saying the game couldn't read a certain file. This happens a lot more than it should. For all it's worth, until this is all fixed, I do not recommend it unless you can stomach having to reload many many times.\nNot to mention how combat is severely imbalanced. There's just too many enemies thrown at you, not enough funds to reasonably upgrade your units, it's just so imbalanced it's not challenging anymore, it'd downright frustrating.

I'm sort of a sucker for stories that throw you into a bad situation that you have to crawl out of.\n\nThe drawing design of the characters is something that is been growing on me (it’s not my favorite but it’s not bad ether). The actual essence of the characters is great. They have a variety of interesting backstories and how they meet you as the main character and very different personalities.\nTalking about music in games isn’t my strong suit because 90% of the time I mute the music but I’d have to say that it’s not too bad in Sunrider. The score chose is pretty on spot with epic battle music when your facing danger and soft mellow when you’re in your capt’n quarters\n\nThis game does have its dips though but really its just nit-pick stuff like:\nOver used battle dialogue, honestly there is only so many times I would want to hear “Haul is still holding” or “Here I go” before I want to choke a ♥♥♥♥♥ but then I remind myself “at least they say something”. Honestly that’s the only bad thing I have to say about it. Of course because of its type it’s not going to be for everyone, its scope is no doubt Anime lovers and armchair starship captains. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve yelled “fire trinities” at my computer.\n\nAll in All 10/10 will fire main vanguard cannons again.","May 29, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After sharing it with someone with a more average rig, they could barely run the game. You can always read it in Novel Mode, but it's not particularly long or worthwhile in that case. Characters are pretty archetypal and the general plot, aside from the diplomat rescue, isn't much to write home about right now.\n\nThe strategy gameplay is somewhat flawed and especially punishing, and late-game is especially brutal with insistence on missile spam that can wipe out most of your team quickly from most ranges. This is especially frustrating in levels requiring you to advance to the opposite side of the map as moving and attack draws from the same energy pool. It does adequately capture the sense of opposing an overwhelming force, but luck-based factors of missing are frequent and necessitate time-consuming save stating and reloading. It's challenging if this is up your boat, but it can easily frustrate in combination with the game engine's inefficiency.\n\nThere are definitely things I like a lot about this, mostly the attention paid to lore and background, and this is definitely a promising enough start to a potential series. The strategy RPG component must be optimized, however, as it is very difficult to enjoy at this point. Much of the story is spent setting up characters and the setting in general, and there is a lot of room to grow and make later episodes much more worthwhile. As a standalone game for now, there's much to be desired.\n\nIt is free, though. If you have a high-end rig, the strategy RPG should run good enough for you to enjoy. Otherwise, you should look elsewhere.","October 16, 2014","false","9.7"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","5"

There is no way to get more detailed breakdown on the enemy ships that I could find. The shield system seems to be buggy - a unit sitting in the middle of two shields takes about 1/3 the damage, at best, that it should from lasers. The flak system is never explained. It shoots down missles, but it's unclear how exactly this calculation works so you just have to guess if the relatively expensive flak upgrades are worth it. Worse yet, later stages feature units that spam missles at you and your flak gets less effective as it shoots missiles down, and one missle volley can half kill (or worse) your lighter units.\n\nBalance\nThe balance needs some serious work in this game. Short-range weapons are largely useless, and this makes Phoenix garbage. The Phoenix has two weapons - Assault, and Melee. Assault and Pulse weapons have horrible accuracy beyond just a couple hexes, and are unable to damage anything with armor, shields, or speed: this is everything in the game. Melee is useless in most situations because being near ANY enemies on their turn means you die. The Phoenix has twice the evasion of any other unit, but even it can't reliably dodge things at its own engagement range. Kinetic has similar accuracy issues - it's almost impossible to hit anything beyond a few hexes, especially fast units - but at least it can do a lot of damage to armored units. Lasers are great until you get to later stages where half the enemy units have shields 1-2 hexes wide. As previously mentioned, overlapping shields are far more effective than math accounts for...for enemies. You do not get the same benefit.  Missiles are great, assuming you can overcome the enemy's flak, but are extremely limited in use so they're not a viable main weapon. Enemies don't suffer from this problem as they seem to carry up to 6 missiles each, and have much higher flak resistance.\n\nUpgrade System\nI'm giving this its own category because it's honestly the root of all the issues in the game. You are given extremely limited funds to upgrade your units with no way to get more outside of the 5 side missions (you can only do 4 of them). The upgrades get expensive very quick, and while you can sell upgrades you lose money in the process. Thanks to the strict funding limit and the increasingly inefficient upgrades you are completely shut out of a number of strategies. Turtling isn't viable after the first few stages due to the overwhelming enemy numbers, the prevalence of missiles and high cost of flak upgrades, and certain mission requirements. You can't focus on evasion because it costs more than you can get to get high enough evasion to survive. So you're forced into an offensive strategy where the upgrades are - for the most part - relatively cheap. Missiles aren't an option because you cannot possible get enough of them to win a stage. So you're forced to level Lasers on the two units that get them (Sunrider and Blackjack) and Kinetics on the rest. You'll also have to raise HP on your units eventually.\n\nSound\nThe voice acting is actually done quite well, which was a pleasant surprise. The music is nice, but gets repetitive after a while. Overall very impressive for a small developer.\n\nGraphics\nThe women are pretty, the ships and ryders are well designed, and the backdrops are well done. No complaints here.\n\nStory\nThe story is a strange beast. It has all the right elements, but it never drew me in and didn't really satisfy. Perhaps it relied too much on tropes, perhaps it's going to work better when it's complete - I can't really say what the issue here is.\n\nIntimacy & H-Factor\nThere is a sad lack of intimant scenes in this VN. There are some very cute ones, don't get me wrong, but most of them fall short of satisfying because they're largely explained instead of shown. You almost never get to see the captain - an attractive, relatively fleshed out main character for a VN - interact with any of the crew. It's a huge missed opportunity. As such there is only one H scene in the entire game - a shower scene. The woman in this scene is very pretty but it's a single still frame and feels very out of place. It would almost have been better to not include it.\n\nOverall\nIt's a good first attempt, but the game needs to deliver on its own promises. This review would have a completely different tone if the promised numerous side missions and lost technology existed in the game, or even if there was a way to engage in random battles to get money for upgrades. A strategy game should allow any strategy one can come up with, not shoehorn you into a single option. One need only look to Super Robot Wars to see how a game like this can work - SRW has limited missions and thus limited income, but it's balanced well enough that there is no useless attack, stat, or unit. Sunrider could learn a thing or two from the SRW series.","November 8, 2015","false","15.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Sounds a little familiar? Galaxy Angel isn't too much different.  For a free game, it's not bad, it goes into some of the usual cliches, but otherwise manages to be entertaining. The combat isn't really explained to you but you'll pick it up quick enough, however it does seem a little wonky, your mechs aren't really able to fit their roles properly, and you'll just usually rely on your flagship to do any damage about 70% of the time.  The game is a little hard in that it takes you a llitle bit to actually find out what's effective, and focus on upgrading that while ignoring everything else, movement costs and certain upgrade prices probably need to be looked at.  Also the art is terrible. It's very bland and as far as character design goes uninspiring. For a game funded on kickstarter I'm pretty sure a better artist could have been obtained, Yes I understand there are a bunch of popular visual novels with less than stellar artwork, but they have more "heart" to them. At least galaxy angel had some style going on, in this the big bad guy is iron mask from F91 if he was a midget elf manlet, wadda ♥♥♥ man.\n\nThe voice acting is tolerable.  The music choice is ill-fitting, super epic orchestral music should be saved for when it really matters, they should have taken a cue from homeworld and made it a bit more chill, hell the galaxy map music sounds like they almost ripped it from mass effect.\n\n\nBut hey, the game was free, and if you like space and mechs maybe you'll enjoy this game.","July 13, 2014","true","43.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's suitable during gameplay segments but during dialogue it is too good for a game using static non-cinematic images and dialogue-segments. Frequent but effectively used short animations and different static-images would have made the epic orchestral score more suitable but also more dramatic as it would have lifted up the presentation and made it better and more dramatic in my opinion. The dignities between the score and VN-segments does not match imo, and little does it help when everything else is usually quiet without any voice-acting other than during gameplay segments. -_-  It put me in a lukewarm, damped enclosed atmosphere. A box.\n\nAnother thing is the lack of achievements wich strips the game from giving me any rewarding feeling after executing an effective battle and being a commander. The last flaw, wich i found a little bit embarrassing was that the galaxy-map is clearly a wannabe and copycat of Bioware's Mass Effect galaxy-map.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twitchedytwitch/recommended/313730/","Twitchedytwitch","Twitchy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twitchedytwitch/","49 products in account","Pretty good game so far, its a game far from completion at this moment since its still within beta , but the game as is ,is not that bad, it includes an interesting storyline, as well as interesting characters , each with their own personalities , unique back stories , Ryder abilities and their own way of interacting with the other characters within the ship, though i must warn you, while this game has a serious main story line , it plays out alot like a harem anime, with all other main characters being female and in their own way likeing you the only main male protagonist , as well as there are some very mature scenes that occure , not all currentl y have art depicting the situation , while others do with the nude shower scene, as well as the game will in the future have Hentai grade sex scenes, but can be completely avoided ( these scenes are currently not in-game) . Excluding the pervy side this game has, its great , it has pretty good story line, great characters, great backstories for them, overall i think its  great game . Thats all for the story line wise, actual game play wise is a completely differnent story , The moments in the game in which you must fight in battles against pirates or PACT bring you to a command screen in which you will control your main ship the sunrider and all the main characters in their ryders ( with the exception of Ava), how ever the game kinda just drops you in , it explains a little bit of what each attack type does , how ever it barely explains any of the abilities that ryders have , forcing you to experiment all the abilities for each character , which can be very troublesom with the fact that some characters drop into your command in the middle of a battle in which you are outnumbered and/or out gunned , making it hard to use them to their max. The battle scenes can get quite laggy and the coding isnt that strong and miscalculations with hit chances are common , for an example you just used one of your ryders to use a pulse attack which is multiple lazer shots with a lower hit chance than a normal lazer , you then try to use another character that happens to be a marksman and you try to use her kennetic sniper attack, the percentage to hit your opponent might at first dispay a lower chance of 10% or 15% or what ever depending on your range, it will either then auto-correct its self or you might have to deselect and then reselect the attack again for the percentage displayed to correct it selfs , which is important because the percent shown is the actual percent of your attack hiting regardless of what your actually using , which can screw you over if you just rush a shot , but it can also be effective if you glitch the game to make a low accuracy, heavy damage shot have a higher chance of hitting than normal. the Pact or Pirate turns are usually very long since they usually outnumber you by a larg e amount and if they use missles you have to wait for the missle to travel accross the map and hit you before it goes to the next attack making turns very VERY long, but spaming space helps out alot. at an overall gameplay is enjoyable once you either experiment and find out what the absolute ♥♥♥♥ happens when you hit the big red button , or you google this stuff ( which i was unsuccsesfull in doing ) so the acctual gamplay is kind crappy, once you figure things out its like a 6/10 it needs to be inproved on , which sucks alot cause the story line is incredibly interesting and when somthing goes wrong it stirs your emotions up , over all this game is a 7/10 great amazing storyline and character interaction while game play is crap, if your like me youll probably just turn the game play down to the lowest difficulty just to get to the next part of storyline stuff. this is deffinetely a game to watch untill its full release, if you are into just pure story i would go for it right now and see if you enjoy it, if gamplay is your thing i would watch this game for now then, as I've heard its full release will be with in 6 months to  a year .","July 22, 2014","true","11.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

You can upgrade its statistic just like you would attributes of your hero. You gain "experiences" in combat, which you can use for special abilities, again in combat.\nYour ship, and all of the other ships in your/enemy fleet have special abilities or attacks. This allows greater tactical (turn-based) combat. The combat could be very enjoyable if it wasn't for one huge problem...\n\nThe problem is, that there is just too much "animations" in the combat, which is extremely boring and a whole lot more annoying. This brings the game down really fast and I just couldn't stand it. You can cut the animations short by clicking, so you will click more than you would in Diablo, and still you will wait a lot because of ... reasons I guess?\n\nSame goes for the dialogues. There is a lot of them, and unfortunately they are unnecessary and uninteresting, which gets really annoying really fast.\n\nSo, I can recommend this game because it's free, and maybe if you have more patience you can delve deeper than I did. I certainly see the appeal, it's just not a game for me.","October 24, 2014","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Decision making is more about your path as a captain--this is interstellar war after all--and you are fighting for the lives of billions of people and the freedom of hundreds of planets.\n\nCharacters are well drawn, have unique personalities, and are each likeable. Game play is a solid mix of tactical combat and vehicle leveling; voice acting is outstanding; a good soundtrack and sound effects round it out. Advice: enemies become over-powered as the story unfolds, so save your game and save your command points for later battles.\n\nLoveInSpace creates quality stories that stick with you.\nI am very much looking forward to Sunrider: Liberation Day","November 20, 2015","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Besides a few cheesy lines here and there the story is well written and each character feels unique from each other. The combat system is fun dspite a few lags here and there causing misclicks and possibly ruinging the whole turn for you, (however the restart turn function is a great way to combat this problem) had one crash the entire time and was able to fix it simply with a restart of the game. The difficulty can be a bit challenging to those who are playing this type of game for the first time, (I did my first playthrough on VN difficulty and still failed). After my third try however I was able to beat the game on a higher difficulty and had a blast the entire time. I would give this game a strong 7/10, with some small problems fixed it's easily an 8/10.","November 23, 2015","true","73.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After playing for several hours I thought I was finally enjoying the game, but then I looked to my left and saw the four bottles of beer I had downed in half an hour and realized that I was just drunk. That's right, I could only enjoy this game drunk. It's that bad.\n\nThe game has two gameplay modes: the visual novel sections through which most of the story is told, and the turn-based strategy battles. Let's address the strategy section first. It is awful. It's not deep nor is it complex. On the default difficulty (Captain) you are at the mercy of a crappy AI. There are missions where it is impossible to guarantee that you will survive the AI's first turn. For example, in one escort mission the AI can easily destroy the unit you are escorting on their first turn; there is nothing you can do to stop this. The only reason you win this mission is if the AI makes crappy decisions and doesn't focus on the escorted ship. And the AI is not scripted to make this bad decision. It will (and did for me) focus down the escorted ship on the first turn several times. Scenarios like this make me feel like I did not defeat a competent opponent, but simply got lucky. The player should never feel like they just got lucky in a strategy game. It's poor design, plain and simple. On top of that, this game suffers from the same problem as XCOM. The random number generator can ruin even the best laid plans. Sure, this is realistic and works if everything else is balanced well. Unfortunately, everything else is not balanced.\n\nNow to the visual novel section. It's also very bad. The characters are 2-dimensional, walking tropes. Nothing about them feels unique or human. You have the (cold)-tsundere, the girl from the countryside with an adowable (read: annoying) accent, the shy girl, the (angry)-tsundere, the Tease, the emotionless quiet girl, the overly loyal service member. It's terrible. Now, nothing is wrong with using tropes, but the tropes should be used to build characters, not define them. Hell, one of the tsundere characters has a line during battle of, "I-I'm not doing this because I like you!" Really? Was the writer even trying to make characters beyond simple tropes? I really hope not.\n\nAs for the story, there was ONE twist that was decent. I won't spoil it. It's predictable, but at least the foreshadowing is handled in a slightly subtle way. The other major twist, at the end of the second chapter is incredibly obvious and I'm not even sure if it should count as a twist. Overall, the story is very bland. The entire first chapter consists of collecting your harem, and the second chapter has the real story, which is mediocre due to predictable twists and bland characters.\n\nLet's get to the main reason you play visual novels (no, not the for the H-scenes, I'll get to that): Choices! Oh, this game is full of choices! Wonderful choices! That mean nothing. Literally nothing. There is only one choice in the entire game that changes anything beyond the scene in which that choice is made. What's the point? Why have a choice mechanic is all but one choice won't matter. Maybe they matter in the third chapter, but I don't care. Choices should have consequences that ripple out throughout the plot. They shouldn't just magically make the ending change without changing how that ending is arrived at.\n\nAbout that H-Scene (yes, H-Scene, singular). I'm not necessarily opposed to them, but they need to make sense withing the narrative of the game. However, this game's H-Scene adds nothing to the story. It's gratuitous and broke my immersion because it made no sense to be there. Throughout the entire game up to this point we had only seen what our main character had seen, then suddenly we see a scene that our main character has no knowledge of, just so that the author could draw a naked girl. It's in poor taste, hurts the game, and makes the game feel even more pandering.\n\nLast complaint, the main character. He is even more bland than the rest of the cast. It's obvious that very little thought went into his visual design, and his few voice-acted lines are awful. They are exactly what you would expect a basement-dweller trying to sound "cool" to sound like. It's bad. Really, really bad.\n\nPros/     Very Difficult Turn-Based Strategy Combat\nSome of the girls visual designs are well done\nCons     You are at the mercy of poor AI and a random number generator\nCharacters are boring at best, and maddeningly annoying at worst\nThe story is generic and predictable\nCompletely unecessary and immersion breaking H-Scene\nMostly awful voice-action, particularly for the main character\nYour choices don't matter (except for one)\nVerdictDo not recommend.\n\nMaybe the story problems are addressed in the third chapter. But I won't ever find out. These first two chapters were so poorly handled that I have no desire to give the third a chance.\n","April 8","false","12.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

A negative review on a game that  I like! I must defeat it for the better good!" *down votes*.\nFear not, those people, because I enjoyed this game too! And to show my appreciation to the game, I will start with the positives. (I will only comment on things I want to expand on.)\n\n+Writing\n(I am bad at judging writing, but it was interesting in at least my eyes.)\n\n+Choices\nThey give you enough choices in the game to help you form your own personality to the player character. Also, the game offers a few difficult choices that doesn't have a right or wrong answer to it (that also helps you build your character's personality).\n\n+Combat\nThe combat is challenging and requires a few retries before beating a "Mission" (that is what it is called in this game). I has a few complexities with it, but if you don't enjoy it (or having a second playthrough) there is a difficulty for that.\n\n+Stat Customization\n(look at the trailer and you'll see)\n\n+The grills girls\nThey've got characters that fill all the palettes of personalities!\nSerious long straight hair childhood friend\nHappy go lucky twintail redhair\nShy smart shorthair\nAssasin tsundere ponytail\nKuudere whitehair\nLoyal dog (if you are into that kind of things) Everyone of those character gets some section on the game to develop as a character.\n\n+Yandere Loli\n\nThe negativesNow when you have gone far enough into this review, you will finally see why I will not recommend this game, even with all those positives!\n\n-Yandere loli not recruitable\nseriously though, she is the best grill\n\n-No routes\nWhich basically means, the story doesn't split up at any point in the game, and if realized, will make the choices feel pointless.\n\n-Random crashes\nTip: Save often.\n\nAll of those negatives wouldn't be there if the game was finished.\nAs a person that haven't been following the development on the game, just got it and tried it out of curiosity, there was no way to know that the game wasn't finished (besides the beta mark at the corner of the screen).\nWhat this is, is the first and second part of a trilogy.\nThere is an unused moral system, and all the routes are supposedly coming out in the third episode. (I had to lurk their official forums to find that out)\n\nAlso, a tip for everyone reading this:\nDon't play games that aren't completed yet.\nYou will not experience the full experience of the game\nYou will get burned out when the game actually comes out\nYou will end in a cliffhanger\nYou will not have to waste money if the final product is bad (doesn't apply in this case).It is bad for you, as a consumer, if you give in to the hype.\n\nReason of not recommending: Not finished.\nMoral of the story: Patience, my friend.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, why does the SIREN SOUND LIKE A FREAKING AIRHORN?????","April 26, 2015","false","19.2"," 30 of 62 people (48%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","48","30","62","12","10"

I realized something:\n\nThe only reason you're in that fight in the first place is because the character is a freaking ♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe developer commentary in the forums basically says "one guy against a galaxy, of course it is hard" -- well, one guy against a galaxy is about like one guy on the beaches of Noirmandy, only a whole lot less likely to survive. Which is why any captain that had two brain cells to rub together wouldn't approach the problem the way this one does. Especially when the storyline immediately prior to that point makes it abundantly clear that he's being played for a sucker on multiple levels.\n\nSo it fails as an interesting turn-based tactical, but much more damning, it fails to establish anything resembling an interesting story, either. Yeah, I could crank it down the last notch, or even just break out the console cheats... or for that matter, probably just edit the game source, if I felt like it.

You can make a choice by morals or by your feelings of revenge.\n\nAlthough it is in beta, I do not recommend this yet, until proper features get into the game.\nBeing able to disable voice by character is a common option for VNs, being able to save just about anywhere and to also load just about anywhere is a must. A battle restart button is in need as I accidentily will  misclick an action and as a result absolutely ♥♥♥♥s over the whole battle for me.\nI would also like to be able to turn off battle cut scenes. They are annoying when you get into large battles and might be lagging the game itself. Various notes and tips need to be put in to explain certain ablities (I still have no idea how stealth works since it doesn't stop enemies from attacking the character.)\nPlease also restrict the amount of missles the enemy has, the battles are insanly hard when going against multiple enemies that carry missles, since they will continue to bombard all my units will infinate missles, while I am only able to carry 1/2 on only a few of mine.\n\nThe voice acting is average-subpar for English (not that suprising). The lines are quite repetitive as they play every time you select, attack, move, or get attacked. It's also filled with internet memes, which really should never be seen as a positive thing as it brings down the quality of the story. There is also a desprate need for more male pilots, since having a cast of female = good guys, male = bad guys gives me a bad taste in my mouth- the commander needs some bros too you know.\n\nOverall it's a pretty alright game, but needs more polishing- which really shouldn't be happening after a VN gets released.","July 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 12 of 28 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","12","28","0","3"

I got to near the end (I believe), but if you're sitting and hoping this is the last encounter as you try it for the third time in aggrivation...its really not worth finishing. I'll go over the three main points I found lacking.\n\nVISUAL NOVEL: As a visual novel, it is -really- lacking. The characters are rather boring, and the choices you make during the story very clearly do not affect what is going on...later on there are a few choices the game doesn't even acknowledge, and just keeps going. I understand branching paths in a strategy game is rather difficult, especially for a free project, but I have seen it done well. If nothing else, at least give the illusion your choices matter, or don't give them at all.\n\nSTORY: As with the above, the story is very bland, and you can drive holes through some of the pieces of plot. I didn't expect Mass Effect or the like, but the characters really drag things down, the whole thing just starts to mesh together, and at the end I was skipping through the flashbacks with annoyance, as they really didn't add anything to the plot other than what felt like an entirely pointless sex scene and to give a reason why we should care about generic dead sister that has not been mentioned until now.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Urg. The sad thing is, the strategy part of the game is very well balanced, with different weapons having different uses. The problem is, the game is balanced, but the fights are not. If you're going to send the player up against 5-1 odds or more, they need to have a significant advantage on their side. You don't. You will often lose units in the first turn of a fight just due to sheer overwhelming firepower. Your units are in general more powerful than similar enemy units, but only in options. Your units are very set in a certain role, and tend to get easily knocked out of it. The sniper unit that can one shot almost everything? Completely useless once the enemy starts getting units that decrease your energy, thus letting her do nothing the entire fight. The buffer unit who can heal or disable units? The same. The other buffer unit? Can't even do that, just a vague 'aim decrease' or damage buff, neither of which makes an appreciable difference. The first mech unit you get in the game? Her major attacks are lasers, which tend to be useless when enemies all start having shields, missiles which go the same for flak, leaving her doing about nothing for most of the game. I hate playing on anything lower than normal, but the first escort mission forced me to do so as you are quickly overwhelmed with no recourse or alternate strategy other than 'try again and get lucky' and even at a lower difficulty the later missions got overwhelmingly onesided, without the abusive strategy of 'warp and major cannon death'.\n\nYes it is free, and its not completely worthless, but it is -very- aggrivating, and there are much better games to spend your time on, even if you have to spend a little for them.","December 16, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 27 people (41%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","41","11","27","0","4"

At the end of the day, the thing that really made me sit up and take notice was the music. I couldn't find a list in the credits, so I have to assume that it's all compiled by the sound engineer until I find out otherwise. The music is suitably epic, it's tasteful electronica with a little bit of metal thrown in, and it really did wonders for the rest of the game.\n\nI also have to say that even though over 75% of the voice actors were the irritating 'japanese space chibi' characters that grind on my nerves, the voice actor for Commander Ava was easy to listen to, and a few of her one-off lines were actually very emotional.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this game, because it's a japanese space chibi harem game, without a compelling premise (PLAY HOMEWORLD INSTEAD, IT'S BETTER) or interesting, multidimensional characters. Still, the gameplay was surprisingly smooth and enjoyable, and I lost almost 3 hours to it.

The game tends to slow down alot, start lagging. I was looking at my cpu usage and this game is cpu intensive. It didnt take any power from the GC, which is the strong point in my PC. I tried playing this game on easy mode, thinking I would have a breeze playing it and enjoying what appeared to be a neat storyline, however, what happened was not the case. All the combat that had taken up to a certain point was very easy, hoever, *SPOILER ALERT* when I have to escort a civilian ship from one side of the grid to the other and the eny does nothing but keep respawing, respawning 3-4 ships at a time AND ganging up on my ryders so I was left with only the firepower the sunrider can muster? It was like I was playing against a player. I tried changing strategies, changing tactics, I went back and redid some of the specs I bought on the ship, but alas, to no avail. Either my ryders are ganged up and shot to hell, so theres no CHANCE I have the firepower I need, or the civilian ship gets ganged up on, either way, I cannot complete the mission at all. Im sure if i spent 4-5 hours, grinding it out, looking for a way to get it done, I could do it. But im on EASY mode! EASY! I shouldnt have to do that. I believe this game is shaping up to be an awesome VN, however, its easy to see why it's still in beta.

I wouldn't know, as the RNG got me killed on multiple occassions. Usually I don't mind when theres an 80% chance to hit and I miss, cause at least the odds are understandble. Multiple misses at 97%, however, seems broken. The story builds up our character to be the galaxy's hope with the best ship in the fleet. Be that as it may, 1000 hits at 1 damage still does 1000 damage, and the RNG makes us miss more often than not, without giving us the same curtosy for the enemy units. There is a mission early on where we have three units and are expected to last against no less than 10 units, which are far tankier than the average mook. For a free beta, its got a good concept.

I don't play a lot of them, but I'm a big fan of tactics games like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem. I obviously wasn't expecting such perfectly polished and balanced gameplay from a free visual novel but man... even my low expectations weren't met. The combat in the game is slow, frustrating and boring. Just look at the demo video on the store page. A single round of one (1) player turn and one (1) A.I. Enemy turn is 4 minutes. FOUR MINUTES! It's not four tatical minutes, four minutes of asking 'what's my next move...?', it's four minutes of animations! of boring, samey shooty laser animations. Since every battle happens in space the developers haven't created terrain elements so you fight on an open field, because fighting takes place on an open field the devs found it appropriate to make movement and attacking draw on the same action resource energy. Attacks don't have a fixed range like in a Fire Emblem game, but longer distances effect accuracy. So when, exactly, is it optimal for me to waste a third of a unit's energy to decrease its chance of being hit by 15%? Battles turn into stagnant ships firing lasers at each other turn after turn, missing then doing minimal damage then missing. The appeal of space battles is totally free movement and this game seems to miss this point all together.\n\nWhy do I have to click to advance the screen after an attack completes? Why would a still image of ship stay on my screen when nothing is happening? Why doesn't this advance automatically? Why does the game let you end a turn without any warning while you still have energy left? This might not happen a lot, but since your end turn button it right next to all your attack and ability buttons, it will happen a few times at least. Also, mousing over certain corners of your action buttons, including the end turn button, causes the screen to scroll. You can't adjust the camera during attack 'animation' sequences and the camera doesn't auto focus on battle action so if you've accidentally scrolled away from the tiny part of the map where units actually are, get ready to have a fun enemy turn trying to get the camera centred! Alternatively, you could just mash left click until it's your turn again. You won't miss much.\n\nAs for the visual novel aspect of the game, I'm unimpressed. If a bunch of anime girls in tight clothing explaining the plot is what you look for in a game, more power to you. When you start with one of the most generic openings and hero motivations (a shady empire destroyed my home) and deliver it in the most predictable way imaginable (what a nice peaceful planet i hope nothing happens to it; alderan much, anybody? hyuk) its hard for me to get invested. When the dialogue isn't gripping because its riddled with anime clichés it's hard for me to get invested. When the game introduces a non-visual novel game mode that drags down the whole experience, I delete local content and move on.","December 2, 2014","false","2.5"," 1 of 10 people (10%) found this review helpful","10","1","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagisachan/recommended/313730/","nagisachan","渚お姉様","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nagisachan/","163 products in account","Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius is an indie visual novel with a catch. Depending on\nthe choice you make at the start of the game, you will play anything ranging\nfrom a good visual novel to a terrible turn-based spaceship battle game.  I had\npleasure to try both the former (visual novel difficulty setting) and the\nlatter (hard difficulty setting). This review is, therefore, split into two\nseparate sections covering both variations of the game separately.\n\nFirst of all, I probably would not even consider playing this game if it was\nnot free, unless I got a strong recommendation from a friend, or the game came\nas a part of a bundle; this game being free will only cost you about 1GiB of\nbandwidth to play and you should definitely check it out.\n\nAlso, thanks to the technology the game is created with (RenPy) this game is\nsupported across three major operating systems. Sunrider deserves a big plus\njust for diversifying Linux gaming ecosystem.\n\nThe great side: visual novel mode\nAs long as visual novels are concerned there’s three things they have going for\nthem: story, art and sound, and the game does fine at most of them.\n\nStory\n\nThis game has a traditional science fiction setting – in a far future the\nhumanity has already inhabited most of the galaxy, they have huge spaceships,\nwarping devices and laser weapons, and, obviously there’s evil guys who try to\ntake over the same galaxy. The writing is very approachable and easy to follow,\nbut repetitive, cliché at times. Sunrider being a visual novel, ability to make\nsome “important” story-altering decisions as the story progresses would be\nexpected; capability to make the decisions is presented, but they appear to\nhave no substantial effect to the story at all: throw a girl into a confinement\nchamber and you will still find her in your virtual harem sometime soon anyway.\n\nArt\n\nThe story is wrapped into beautiful japanimation-style art, as common to most\nof the visual novels. It is clear that much attention was dedicated to it and I\nhereby declare art to be the best thing about Sunrider.\n\nSound\n\nUnlike the art, the music is in a much worse shape. While the selection of\ntracks is quite likeable, they have a severe deficiency that should not have\nbeen overlooked for beta – the tracks lack any form of loudness normalisation.\nYou will find yourself reaching for volume control to save your ears when a\nlouder than usually track starts casually ♥♥♥♥♥♥ them.\n\nOn the positive side, the characters are voiced! I’m making the Asaga’s “I’m\nfiring my lasers” my alarm right now. A big +1 here.\n\nThe bad side: combat mode\nNow, if you happen to make a mistake and pick any difficulty harder than the\n“visual novel”, you will find yourself battling 8-bit sprites better part of\nthe game instead of indulging in textual pleasures with your virtual harem\nand, occasionally, a dude or two. This does not sound like a problem until you\nrealize there’s only a few types of units available to fight against and they\nare all powered by a pretty stupid, suicidal AI (more likely, just a few hard\ncoded patterns) making the combat mode a lackluster.\n\nSound\n\nThe playlist in combat mode seems to differ somewhat from the one used for the\nvisual novel mode. Regardless, music here suffers from the same issues\nmentioned in the visual novel part of the review. Moreover, all this is made\nworse by the playback of the tracks: they are stopped after each turn and\nanother randomly selected track is started from the beginning when next turn\ncomes around. This results in a feeling of discontinuity and, alas, makes it\nhard to appreciate the possibly fine music in its full form.\n\nMisc\nBugs\n\nWhile I realise this is a beta version, it is still quite easy to encounter a\ncrasher or two and get thrown back into the main menu losing all your progress\npast the last save. Other bugs I found (where’s the “report a bug” button?)\nqualify for beta-grade and mostly consist of graphical issues such as\nmiscalculated text baselines in research fund allocation screen.\n\n---\n\nIn conclusion, while I’d like to rate this game as two separate games, Steam\nonly has a single binary switch. Therefore, unless I rate visual novel part\n>8/10, the average score turns out to be less than ½, hence the “thumbs-down”.","November 12, 2014","false","5.7"," 0 of 8 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","8","0","0"

First, combat gets extremely tedious whenever the enemy has over 5 units, since you have to wait for each of them to individually move, fire, and see the results of the firing. And no, you can't just skip it. The HP and energy bars are unclear, so it's very hard to tell about how much health or energy a unit has at a glance.\n\nHowever, the worst part is the character design. It is sexist, lazy, and insulting. All the women have the same body shape and face, despite being from different planets and regions of the galaxy. And the art looks too far finished for it to just be placeholders. And the pilot "uniforms" that the designers came up with are clearly impractical, and you can tell that they just took one of them and copied and pasted after changing the colors. They didn't even bother to erase their navels since the model they designed it after for some reason had a bare midriff. Also, it's plain insulting to assume the audience wouldn't notice the fact that 6 different mech pilots, how arrive on your ship at five seperate times, from various backgrounds, somehow have exactly the same outfit? Despite two of them being from different militaries, and by the way, it's extremely insulting to actual women military personal to put fictional military personal in those kinds of outfits.\n\nTL;DR: Combat needs to be streamlined, and character art is sexist trash.","July 16, 2014","false","15.4"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","6","21","0","6"

Interactive novel? Sure. Sci-Fi setting? Absolutely. Turn-based tactical combat system with upgrades? It's like a dream come true. Great in theory, but poorly executed.\n\nI slammed face first in a massive difficulty spike early in the game. Playing on normal, I went from clearing the maps with no challenge to facing non-stop failures. I tried everything I could think of, and I faced a mission so terribly unbalanced that it has all the hallmarks of being unbeatable. Reading through the forums, this is an issue that's been known since at least August and still hasn't been resolved. I have lost all interest in trying to progress past this and seeing the rest of the game, or of anything else from the developers. If they can't get the balance right on something right at the start, where does that leave me thinking about anything else they do? If you aren't going to try and make it a fun experience, why bother having it there at all?","October 6, 2014","false","2.9"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KianaWolf/recommended/313730/","KianaWolf","Kiana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KianaWolf/","141 products in account","A game with potential, which it unfortunately wastes. If I had to sum up the game in a word: Bland.\n\nEverything about this game is generic or disappointing. Let me run through a quick list:\n-Characters are standard sci-fi anime archetypes, done completely straight. They feel like cardboard cutouts, not characters.\n\n-Character art is decent, but plain and the poses are quite stiff. The skintight latex space suits aren't anything thrilling, either.\n\n-Stilted, unnatural dialog and forced exposition. This isn't helped by how the ship apparently only has two people on it early on, who get stuck expositting between each other in really forced ways. Especially jarring was the supposed terror of seeing an enemy's super weapon reading like B-movie acting.\n\n-Utterly forgettable ship and robot designs. Nothing you probably haven't seen a dozen times before.\n\n-A plot that comes off as painfully forced and cliched. Enemy fleet manages to sneak up to your homeworld despite the supposed existance of an allied fleet. Apparently the only ship in the area is yours, which is still in dry dock without having finished its test run. The only reason your ship even survives is because the enemies are so incompetent that they shoot the dry dock instead of the immobile ship. Then you fly off to meet the fleet, which is immediately decimated by the aforementioned super weapon, which proceeds to nuke a city we are supposedly to care about, despite never having seen it. Oh, and how the characters instantly know there have been a million casualties despite the very next line indicating that you've lost all contact with civilian and military command. All to set up the same 'one ship again an entire enemy empire' plot that, again, you've probably seen a dozen times before.\n\nThat's just the first mission, mind. The second mission goes the unfortunate route of throwing not only a little girl pirate (who is both in command and has a hair trigger for being called little, because that's totally character depth and not just another tired trope!) at you, who will apparently blow multiple holes into your hull in one shot, despite said shot doing a piddly amount of damage. All to force a cutscene where some girl shows up to bail you out from out of nowhere. Apparently I'm supposed to be impressed by the rescue from enemies I could probably obliterate on my own?\n\nAnd it is at this point I shut down the game and started writing this review, because of the final nail in this game's coffin. You see, as much as I like a solid plot and interesting characters (and trope heavy games can still be interesting if handled well), I can tolerate a dull plot if the gameplay is fun enough.\n\n-The gameplay is not fun. If some of the problems were shored up, it could be above average. But as it stands, gameplay is plodding, combat is bland, there's constant animation lag due to system inefficiencies and the game doesn't offer anything I couldn't find in other games.\n\nWith all that, I can't even find it in me to be angry at anything in this game. It's just so bland and boring that I had to get a cup of coffee just to stave off my apathy long enough to write this review. That isn't a joke.\n\nI am left wondering why anyone thought cobbling together a combat system for ren'py of all things was a good idea, though. It's a sytem designed for visual novels, where there will be a background and four character sprites/images on screen at most and all gameplay is menu based. It's good at what it's designed for, but as you can see, trying to force it to do something it wasn't designed for leaves it a sluggish mess.\n\nBut with that being said, I think I'll keep the game installed for a while. As I said in the beginning: It has potential. It's just that all that potential is sadly untapped right now. Maybe after a couple months of fixing the slow combat and editing the writing a bit, I'll come back and love the game. It would be unexpected, but certainly a pleasant surprise. So here's hoping, I suppose.","July 27, 2014","false","1.0"," 5 of 20 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","5","20","0","0"

The story line is Really good, the characters are funny and original (internet puns to the side XD) and their actually Believable. They never felt like they were closet characters or puppets, they actually felt believable. The combat (AT FIRST!) was interesting and innovative, it handled differently, but in a good way.\n\nCons\n\nThe game is IMPOSSIBLE to beat. Period. There's a point later on in the game (I'll not say whats going on for spoiler's sake) But the enemy fires rockets at you. The AI is programmed to SPAM missles and rockets, missles do ok damage, rockets do a TON. After being ♥♥♥♥♥ (I mean, as in my main battleship died on round TWO because those ♥♥♥♥ers fired ALL their rockets and missles and killed me instantly) about 6 times, and the other four my Ryders (pilotable mechs) were destroyed first, leaving the Sunrider (your main battleship) the sole focus, making the mission completely impossible. I really don't see how your supposed to be able to fight this, and if this fight is an indication of battles to come. I want NOTHING to do with this game. The unfairness of the combat, and how the AI can completely smoke you like that ruins all the pro's.\n\nI LOVE RTS games.

To start with the prose is a bit poor and there were some turns of phrase so odd they forced me to look it up to confirm that it was, in fact, written by americans. The characters are cliches played entirely straight which fits in well with the developers obstinate adherence to the visual novel genre and its painful idosyncrasies. The overarching storyline is somewhat blatantly that of the Star Wars prequels and with the equal lack of orginal or empathizable characters it seems the only creative thought involved was the addition of turn based combat.\n\nThe turn based combat in question is much the same as the VN section except that most of its user interface issues are solely its own rather than attributes of the genre. The limited number of your units ,especially in the early stages of the game, leads to relatively short periods of you actually doing anything followed by incredibly long periods of enemies incredibly poorly animated cutscene attacks. The tactics themselves are rather basic though the general lack of explantion of various statistics and the small size of text in what few tooltips exist serves to rather effectively disguise that fact.\n\nOverall the game isn't terrible but your time would be better spent on something with a bit more charm.","July 10, 2014","false","2.7"," 4 of 19 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","4","19","0","0"

On a world, beyond the Alliance's reach, a slave boy has grown up, and grown tired of the pirates, slavers and other criminal riff-raff, and forms PACT, an anti-alliance orginisation, hell-bent on taking control of the galaxy so they can help the common man. PACT sounds like a good faction when you look at the job description, but by action, it is clear they are no friend of anyone, not realising, or ignoring their inner-dictator, PACT attacks the neutral world Cera, home to captain Kayto Sheilds, and first officer Ava, who have been entrusted with the hyper-advanced warship, Sunrider.\n\nTogether with a baker, a wannabe hero, a merc, a girl from another time, a discredited medical officer and a black ops agent (which you don't exactly start with any of them with you. The game has "boss fights" where only two of them have unique units, but every mission is strategic challange in itself. Even if you are a seasoned strategy veteran, you will have trouble later even on normal difficulty, and if you feel suicidal, try space whale difficulty.\n\nI'll forgive the lacking voice acting, and low gameplay-to-storyline ratio, because it was done so well.\n\nI couldn't help but be reminded of HOTD's soundtrack, and Halo's story whilst playing Mask of Arcadius, as it has it's own character, humour and soul, unlike most of the games we play.\n\nIf you want a game that will make you laugh, cry, ragequit and do a victory dance (I certainly did all of these), Sunrier: Mask of Arcadius, is your game.\n\nNow for Love in Space's to do list:\n-Make an awesome game - Check\n-Make a sequel - in progress\n-Make an anime\n-DLC\n-(optional) Put a price tag on Mask of Arcadius\n-Nerf that awakened blackjack.

Good story and characters (with one possible exception).\n2. Decent turn-based combat.\n3. Very funny moments.\n\nCons:\n1. A bit immature at times.\n2. Combat gets frustrating and un-fun near the end of the game.\n3. I'm suspiciously surrounded by attractive young women.\n\nLong version:\n\nLet me start out by saying that I have not seen enough anime to recognize tropes. Because to me these characters appeared to be fully fleshed out and enjoyable individuals. Regardless of what the others say I found them to be likable and believable (with the exception of Claude who's only personality trait is that she's hopelessly infatuated with you). They have there own problems and strengths that they bring to the gameplay. Everyone of them is a capable warrior who contributes a great deal to the combat when used properly.\nThe story itself starts out pretty basic. Take revenge against the jerk who destroyed everything you hold dear. the game also gets amazingly deep at the same time. They allow the world that they have created to mirror our own to a large degree. Anyone with a passing understanding of history will notice that the main villains are Space Communists and that the urban warfare story arch is remniscent of our fights in the Middle East. In fact, the game takes a long, hard look at the horrors of war when you can't tell friend from foe and the consequences thereof. It really challenged me to reconsider how war should be conducted. It should be noted that it didn't change my mind but it forced me to accept that such conditions are simply horrible.\nBack to the characters. They all have a certain charm about them. There's not a one that I wish was not there. Even Claude (shallow as she is) brings a certain entertainment value with her. Most have a tragic backstory that elicited an emotional response from me (though it could be that I'm a sucker for a pretty face).\nThe combat seems hit-or-miss to me. On one hand it has several ways of doing damage. Each method has it use and optimal situation, but it always seemed better to get into a situation where one heavier damage types could be used. I always ended up grouping my units together for prtection and going from there. Flanking is not an option. Ever. It can also be rather frustrating later as hundreds of missiles get thrown at you until one or two of your units are down by the second round. Eventually I lowered the difficulty until I could just proceed with the story. This is largely because the story was by far the strongest element of the game.\nThen there's the "fanservice." I know that it's my fault for not looking into the game enough (ooooh free stuff), but  I rather wish it wasn't there. I came to love the characters when they were fully dressed, I will continue to love them even if they remain so. There is really no need for such gimmicks. Especially since the writers have proven that they can craft a beautiful galaxy and narrative without such foolishness. Basically, developers, you're better than this by no small margin.","November 21, 2014","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A bit risque, but that's what we're all in here for, anyway. A big ol' harem full of busty mech pilots.

It attempts to be both a graphical novel and a tactical space game, and neither are done well enough for me to enjoy the game more than about 10 minutes.\n\nWeaknesses with the combat aspect:\n- Choppy UI and slow pace\n- Nothing special about the combat\n(I spent more time writing this review than I did playing the game, so ... I could be wrong.)\n\nWeaknesses with the novel aspect:\n- The opening of the game feels a little too familiar: your ship's built, still needs polish but it's pretty much good to go, and it's being attacked! Fight!!! Oh my gosh! Mega ship! Run and we will return to avenge the homeworld!!!\n- The text when people talk is really small, my eyes hurt trying to read it.\n- People who I don't know at the beginning of the game are talking a lot and I'm not feeling them.\n- [/me looks at data files in the steam folder...] Where are the men? I think that even if I was a boy with raging hormones in junior high just wanting to look at hot chicks on space ships, I'd still like to have someone I could relate to.\n- There's someone at the beginning whose name is Shields (there are no graphics for any males, btw), I thought I was talking to the Shields system or something, I'm not sure. Maybe someone was a fan of Brooke Shields and they thought it could be like a first name? I feel like if I keep playing I will run into all sorts of what I guess are translation weirdness and that makes me feel uncomfortable.","February 3, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That causes funny and arkward situations on the spaceship. Music is good, it's suits the game very well. The drawings are nice. The mechs look good and have several small animations. Due to money constrains they could not add more, cause it has been funded by Kickstarter. Althought low budget the game does not feel cheap, but nice en enjoyable to play. The battles require some tactics, it's not just do something and you will win. The mechs and ship can be upgraded with the spoils of war, the money you gain from destroying enemies. During the conversations and actions between enemies and friends you can choose what to say.\n\nOne remark: It would have been great if they chose to implement the basegame as 12 years old and the 18+ as an upgrade.

The story is interesting, and throws you through loops at times.\n\nThe combat system is easy to grasp and the battles are almost always fun. The variation between your own mechs is interesting and makes you really think about how to spend your credits for upgrades. The moral choices are a lot grayer than the classic "A) Kick puppies, B) Don't kick puppies" choices a lot of other games have. It'll actually push you to choose between soul-satisfying morality and sheer pragmatism without making your character out be an angel from above or a Grade-A ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ depending on your decision.\n\nIf you're up for a challenge, Sunrider's got your fix. Its curve gets really steep, really fast.\n\nVoice acting is pretty good for a free VN. Though the limited dialogue selection in combat will wear on you sometimes.\n\nThat being said, there were some issues:\n\nThe difficulty curve steeped just a little too fast. This might only be an issue on account of me being a crap captain, though.\n\nThere are practically no side missions before you've collected all of the ryders; which you'll need to collect more credits and command points than what the main story missions provide. So unless you're playing anything below Captain, be prepared to face a near-endless parade of anal destruction before you finally achieve victory. Don't get me wrong, victory is still possible, but it takes a ridiculous amount of luck (Get on your knees and pray to RNGesus, heretic) and retries.\n\nI like having romantic options in my VNs, but I didn't get any of that despite the very distinct implication that there were going to be routes for the girls. The options weren't so much absent here as they were dangled just out of reach. You'll start with the feeling that you have actual choices in regards to who you end up with, but one girl is practically being forced on you (though it did make for good dramatic scenes) the entire time. The greater story and the combat missions more than make up for it, but if you're here just to claim another waifu, you won't get anything substantial. Might I recommend waiting for Sunrider Academy to come out?\n\nThe Skip Mode (Press Tab to toggle) is a godsend. It makes it so you don't have to sit and watch for 2 minutes as the enemy inundates you with missiles and lasers. Unfortunately, it'll also skip through mid-battle dialogue, and you can't scroll up to read it if you missed it.\n\nOverall 8/10\n\nI can't wait for the next installment.","January 7, 2015","true","22.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't sure if a VN should even have any combat system. Of course, that thinking was formulated due to never encountering such a unique feature before in a VN. 11.5 hours later and I had completed the game. All in one sitting, sure I could have finished it earlier but I thought that would've been a waste.\n\nWhen I finished story, I just realised how short of a gameplay that actually was and I was sad, I wish I could have played for a longer duration. I loved this game. I loved the characters, story and combat. The voice acting in the combat is probably the best thing in the game, quite well done. The main thing that annoyed me though, was probably the way it was third-person at times. "Shields did this, Shields did that" I know the whole story was not through the first person perspective of Kayto but that annoyed me XD.\n\nI've only finished the story twice so I won't include everything.\n\nAfter you finish this, consider playing the Sunrider Academy Demo :)\nAlso awesome.\n\nVN's I've played (And finished):\n\nDigital: A Love Story\nDon't Take It Personally, Babe, It Just Ain't Your Story\nKatawa Shoujo\nIf My Heart Had Wings\nNarcissu\nEverlasting Summer\nMore but I can't remember :L\ntl;dr\n\nJust try it.

Okay, take mass effect, mash it with your favorite visual novel, then bake it with some really fun gameplay. And then you have this thing.\n\nLets start with the actual game elements- the tactical combat. While it might have not been the most complex system out of this genre, I found it to be interesting enough to be both fun and challanging. The ability to upgrade your individual units was a very nice touch. Gameplay was really well done, very satisfied.\n\nNow lets move on to the characters/art design. I have to say I really enjoyed the whole artstyle of this game, from the mechs (Ryders) you command, to your crewmembers, it was all very well made. The characters themselves prove to be the best part about this game, each with their own unique personality, if a bit cliche at times.\n\nOkay, here's the big part. The story.\nWhere do I even begin?\nFor the most part, it reminds me a lot of mass effect, it has a very similar setting, along with certain other things about the game. For the most part it's sort of cliche, not much done here that hasn't been done before.\nAnd then there's the "visual novel" part.\nFor the first three quarters of the game I was enjoying everything, till about near the end where the main character randomly has a mental breakdown before confessing his love to TWO girls I didn't even care much about to begin with. You're given no choice as to who you want to be with in the story, an aspect which I found extremely disappointing for such an otherwise great game. You are given decisions, which do affect the game, just not quite in the way I'm satisfied with.\n\nOverall, the game is really fun, the gameplay is solid, the characters are great, the overall story is pretty good, but I was disappointed in the "visual novel" aspect of the game.\n\nIt is however, free, and gave me about 24 hours of campaign time, so I definately recommend playing this to anyone slightly interested in visual novels, science fiction, or mass effect.\n\n***8/10***","January 14, 2015","true","27.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They intermixed focused tactical battles with an interesting and entertaining story.  I think this achieves the same.  It was a very pleasureable and challenging playthrough.\n\nI was very fond of the leveling system with one criticism.  You'll find yourself leveling 'just enough' to get a particular combo you are interested in being able to use.  So you'll experience sudden jumps with specific characters suddenly being able to do their super move twice and the like.  However, this almost exactly suits the planned tactical elements of the game and is likely legit.  Level that character to a good cut off and then focus down another.\n\nBottom line, great game.  It's got great gameplay combined with a cool story.  The troporific harem is obviously oriented towards a hetero male (and well done!), but if you're missing one or both of those attributes I think you'll have a great play through and some laughs along with it.","January 15, 2015","true","23.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Due to money constrains they could not add more, cause it has been funded by Kickstarter. Althought low budget the game does not feel cheap, but nice en enjoyable to play. The battles require some tactics, it's not just do something and you will win. The mechs and ship can be upgraded with the spoils of war, the money you gain from destroying enemies. During the conversations and actions between enemies and friends you can choose what to say.\n\nOne remark: It would have been great if they chose to implement the basegame as 12 years old and the 18+ as an upgrade.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mad_Scientist/recommended/313730/","Mad_Scientist","Mad Scientist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mad_Scientist/","416 products in account","I played the first 2 (of 3) of the releases of this game.  (The 3rd has not been released, yet.)  This review will reflect my experience with the story as it has progressed thus far.  This game is composed of a Story (i.e. Visual Novel), and a series of many tactical Combat Sequences.  I will rate them individually.\n\nOverall, I give this game a 2 out of 5 Stars.  That translated to a mild Thumbs Down, with some specific caveats.\n* Story: 4/5\n* Combat: 1/5\n\nThis game is a Free to Play (F2P) game, so I have no issues in terms of value vs. price.  However, I did notice many small issues in the dialogue where the phrasing didn't quite match the context.  I'm not sure if this is due to a translation issue, or whether it is consistant with some international style of anime I'm unaware of.  Either way, I found it mentally jarring and annoying.  ("North" in terms of galaxy star maps, space ships being "Sunk" instead of destroyed, etc.)  It was consistant, so once I was able to accept it, I could play on.\n\nThe story itself was fascinating to me.  Especially the forced choice situations with murky morality and ambigious contexts.  To me, this was the highlight of the game.  I rarely really have to *think* through decisions in an RPG; this game had me mentally biting my nails, wondering if I had chosen wisely.\n\nHowever, on the flip side, the combat was very frustrating.  The game, despite the tooltips, doesn't explain what is happening very clearly.  You often have to learn by obvervation, the hard way.  On top of that, it's "supposed to be hard", at least according to the developers.  Those combine easily into scenarios where you make poor decisions in upgrading your ships and suddenly end up with a fleet that is unable to beat an opposing force, two or three times down the road.  (Even after you drop the game difficulty to the easiest level.)\n\nI started this game on Captain difficulty.  I made some mistakes, in restrospect, in terms of upgrades.  Plus, the game acelerates the difficulty very sharply.  One minute you can complete a battle with almost no damage, the next battle suddenly you can't survive.  To me, this is a sign of poorly designed mechanics and game design.  (I did an experiment with the highest difficulty setting - Space Whale, and discovered that I often got wiped out on the intro [easy] battle.)\n\nHowever, it was fun enough that after I dropped it to the easiest difficulty, I went back and restarted the game.  (Thank goodness for the elaborite "fast forward" skipping options.  Maybe that is a hint of how often they expect players to need to restart.)  I tried it out on Ensign, and then restarted ... again.  By now I was quite frustrated, since I had now invested many hours into a game that kept putting me in dead end scenarios.\n\nI looked up support forums, and found several of the things I had done wrong, and then tried again.  The reason I'm giving it 3 stars overall, is that I felt the game was good enough to restart instead of merely abandoning it.  However, I was very frustrated along the way.\n\nI finally "finished" the game [up to the end of the second part] on Visual Novel difficulty, and just "Auto Won" some of the battles I had played over and over again using the developers debug mode.  Once I caught up to where I had left the story previously, sometimes detouring through some of the choices not previously taken, I was able to enjoy the story again.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the story, but hated the combat.   I tend to like tactical games, but I'd rather play a combat game that took the time to impliment it in a reasonable way, instead.\n\nAt this point in time, I'm not sure whether or not I will play the 3rd chapter when it comes out.  I'm just glad to finally be finished being frustrated with this game for awhile.\n","November 28, 2014","false","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Theres a million good reviews and I might be the only person having maddening problems with this game so chances are, you'll enjoy it.  However, not an hour into the game I began to feel like this game might just be unplayable without tearing my hair out from annoyance. These are the problems I have been dealing with..\n\nThis game seems to have mostly good reviews and I'm not surprised. I am really enjoying the story so far and the gameplay is creative and fun in concept. OH and I LOVE the music in this game. ...But I am frustrated with my game being slow. There aren't really and graphics options and there really don't need to be. I don't have a custom built gamer-tank of a computer, but I doubt this game is meant to be demanding..\n\nI don't know if I'm alone in this, but transitioning between shots in the battle scenes is hell. After whatever animation has occurred, I find myself constantly wondering if the game is waiting for me to click before it transitions (I'm still not sure). This wouldn't be so terrible if there wasn't a short cutscene initiated by each attack (this early in the game I'm using at least 5 attacks in the round. on top of that, you are often facing many enemies, which means many, many choppy cutscenes).\n\nThe screenshots of this game show cool and unique icons representing each unit. I am not seeing that at all. I see the hexagons and numbers representing unit health, move distance, etc. In addition it takes at least five seconds after clicking a unit for its stats or options to pop up. Not to mention the occasional (Program Not Responding) issue upon selecting units.\n\nOverall, I think this game is great in story and gameplay, but the slow interface has left me utterly exhausted and feeling like the extra three hours I expected to stay up playing this wouldn't get me very far at all.

Not only if you want to see all the storylines and/or bragging rights but also to replay the battle phases like a turn based strategy game.","January 22, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will start off by saying this--I hate anime.  Yet, somehow, I am in love with this game.  It is a glorified visual novel that gives you choices in dialogue for taste, although they don't exactly change much (or anything) in the storyline.  Beyond the storyline, which is very impressive, is the combat phase, which I believe is easily the best component of the game--even including the hot women, boobs, and great soundtrack.\n\nTo make a long story short, without spoilers, you play as Kayto Shields, the captain of the Sunrider, and you are thrown into the middle of an intergalactic war, and are forced to play a vital role, unveiling more and more of the story down the road.  The Sunrider has an array of militaristic power on its vessel, ALL of which are upgradable to what seems like an infinite limit, given the resources.  Throughout the story, you will meet formidable foes and loyal allies, who will join your cause with their "ryders", which are mecha-like space warriors--again, all are upgradable, and vastly different from one another.\n\nThe combat is utterly fantastic, especially if you are a fan of turn-based tactical combat.  You control your Sunrider and the rest of your fleet on a hexagonal grid, using different abilities and weapon types on enemy ships and bases.  The difficulty of the game is naturally VERY difficult, but can be changed at any time, if you're having too much trouble in fights, or want to make things a lot tougher.\n\nIf I have to give any downsides to this game, it's that it simply ends TOO QUICKLY.  Granted, this is meant to be a space trilogy, but I had the same empty feeling beating the second (and most up-to-date) campaign  as I did after I watched Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back--just begging for more, and not able to obtain it.  Kind of like having a poster of Kate Beckinsale in your bedroom.  Speaking of hot women, there are plenty in the game (in anime style, of course), and even some occaisonal nudity.\n\nThis game is ABSOLUTELY FREE, there are no hidden fees, it's not pay-to-win, it's not an MMO.  I would gladly pay for this game, and don't even have to.  Do yourself a favor and at least TRY out this game, because it is an epic space saga that will give you the same feeling as Bill Pullman's spine-chilling speech in Indepedence Day.\n\nI rate this game an 8.8 out of 10.","January 22, 2015","true","16.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zamidge/recommended/313730/","Zamidge","Zamidge","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zamidge/","63 products in account","When I first saw Sunrider, knowing nothing about it, I expected it to be another mediocre amateur visual novel. Picked it up because I saw some nice reviews. The fact it was free was the deciding factor. I was still skeptical about the game in the first hour of so of gameplay, but at that point, it had already surpassed my low expectations with pretty good artwork and a surprisingly awesome soundtrack, so I pressed on. I'm glad I did.\n\nBefore I say anything more, I haven't completed the game yet. As I write this I am 16ish hours into the game and have no idea how much longer I have until it ends. Was itching to write something about this game, so consider this a mere first impression.\n\nI'll start with the storyline. Generally speaking, it's your typical sci-fi-themed "bad guys want to take over the galaxy" plot. Nothing revolutionary, but it's something anyone can get behind. Not to say that it's too bland-- one event in particular substituted otherwise obligatory deus-ex machina for an interesting character development, so there's more to it than initially meets the eye.\n\nNext up, characters. Like the plotline, the characters never stray too far from their respecting tropes. Any fan of anime, manga or other VNs will immediately notice this. You are given your standard-issue sassy girl, shy girl, ditzy girl, tsundere, kuudere, etc etc characters to work with. Most people I talk to either love or hate that sort of thing. Some, like me, will find them endearing, others may feel apathetic. You decide.\nThe main bad guy (thus far) is the malicious masked villain with a penchant for evil laughter. I'm hoping that more will be done with him later on to make him seem less silly.\n\nAs for gameplay, Mask of Arcadius features a turn-based strategy element for its battles that can be summarised in one word: CRUEL. I am playing on the default difficulty setting as I usually do for my first playthroughs of games; in this case, the 'Captain' difficulty. I fancy myself a pretty good tactician, especially when it comes to turn-based strategy, but I am stuck on one mission right now that I am semi-convinced is impossible [at this difficulty] without spending your upgrades and command points flawlessly up to that point. The difficulty levels' descriptions give you fair warning and are changeable in game, but this will be the first time that I have to undergo the moral seppuku of lowering a game difficulty below default. It got to a point where my squishier units were being picked off by missiles before my 2nd turn. Even when they miraculously survive, it isn't long before a horde of missile-spewing reinforcements arrive as the final nail in the coffin. Seriously, I haven't died this many times since my first playthrough of Dark Souls.\nThe combat system might benefit from a bit more tweaking while it's in beta, but the gameplay is still very fun and incredibly satisfying to finally win against the always unfavourable odds the game will throw at your from the very beginning. If for nothing else, you should play the game on this merit.","December 30, 2014","true","25.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If the publishers could keep the text to a minimum, there would be no need for the skip mode and all that work they've done wouldn't be lost.\n\n2) You need to click after every bit of animation, which gets really annoying after a while. There's also the character voice over after each attack that tells you a second time the result (hit, miss, etc). There's a skip mode for this too.\n\n3) The mecha and ships are awesome, but the illustrations/models need to be more dinamic. The mechas are usually just standing up and just lifting their arms to aim their weapons. More dynamic poses would help a lot.\n\n4) Battle text is tiny, REALLY tiny.\n\nAs you see, these are all little things that could be easily fixed. Even though I'm not a fan of the all kawaii girl anime, I really dig the story (when I don't have to click for 10 minutes of text), and the whole mothership-mecha theme.","November 16, 2014","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's a lot of things I really love about this title, and then it introduces something that makes me say "...so close."  Take the combat for example:  it's tight, engaging, there's enough diversity and a bit of room to explore...but it could be so much more.  A few more side missions; the chance to recruit a few other pilots; maybe some mechs that are choice based unlockables.  You can do a lot here, fairly easily and what you do get is nice...but it could better.\n\nThe story's the same way.  It's moving and interesting and it presents a lot of pressing moments...but then it makes some half-hearted attempt at humor and all I can do is cringe.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I enjoyed this game and I'd recommend it to anyone who can look past the dating sim exterior, but it could have been a solid, all-around title with broad spectrum mass appeal.

First impression was ok, game graphic is cute, soundtrack is very good, but most important of all is part of game dedicated to combat.\n\nCombat experience is fantastic. Excellent soundtrack, voice acting (Asaga firing her lasers is my #1), all together it gives quite unique and very addictive atmosphere. All these lasers, cannons and missiles strongly bring me memories of books about Honor Harrington and her adventures. Combats are quite difficult, after combat story develops a bit and there is another... starting game for "just one combat and then go to sleep" is almost impossible\n\nStory get interesting (sometimes it is predictable, but I don't mind), each person in crew has its unique personality (often crazy in some way) but they are very likeable. So far I don't know how much can be changed with differentdialog choices when they are available. But I am sure i will replay this game several more times - these combat parts are worth it.\n\nNegative points are for user interface which is sometimes very ugly (especially managing saved games), sometimes not very user friendly and clearly didn't got too much attention from developers. Also in combats it is sometimes frustrating when some tooltip or image overlaps part of grid, or when instead of selecting one fighter you accidentaly move current one to position next to it.","October 4, 2014","true","24.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm always a sucker for stories with anime girls, space ships, and giant robots, and I found this one to be thoroughly enjoyable. The story is pretty good, especially for a free Visual Novel! I found myself drawn in from the very start, and I wondered how my decisions would affect the outcomes! Your decisions can truly make a difference in the direction the story takes, I think (I've only seen how they affect things a couple of different ways). And I was actually a bit surprised at how dark the story got in places. As for the strategic battle sections, I found them to be quite fun. As the game progresses, the missions get quite difficult! I had to lower the difficulty setting from normal (Captain as of the Mask of Arcadius update) to get through the game! And even then, figuring out the best strategy wasn't "easy," especially in the later missions. All in all, definitely worth a playthrough. And if strategy isn't your thing, you can even play on "Visual Novel" mode so that the battles are nearly impossible to lose.\nThe only complaint I have, is that since it is still in Beta, the bugs haven't been totally worked out yet, and you may end up running into some points where the game crashes. But it's free, the story is good, the gameplay is fun, the artwork is great, and the music is pretty awesome!

You will not have any meaningful choices in this campaign where as first arrival had multiple meaningful choices or seemingly meaningful choices. I had a major problem with crashes on my pc and framerate issues. A problem that needs to be addressed is the spawning spam that enemies use: certain missions have carriers that can spawn ryders that will be able to attack that turn and if the carriers are not attacked and destroyed right away you will fail because they will spawn infinite ryders. I faied a mission because the carriers had spawned 6 support units on top of the 2 they already had which meant they turned off the flak on all of my units as well as using disable on my sniper and heavy kinetic units which made the carriers impossible to kill.

And free.\n\nNow to the game itself:\nThere are two aspects of the game, the visual novel aspect and the strategy one. In both cases the game does some things incredibly well and others... not so well.\n\n\nFirst, the game as a visual novel.\n\nThe story is quite good. It's not the best plot I've ever seen (in fact, it's pretty linear) but it works, and it's interesting enough to keep you playing.\n\nThe characters are outstanding and well made. They may be the typical anime characters (the shy one, the serious one, the one who hides her feelings, the joyful one, etc) but they never feel plain nor boring.\n\nThe diferent choices you can make are interesting. It's not just the overused "are you a good or bad guy?". There are some tough decisions to be made. The downside part to this is that this choices have no impact on the story... for now. The only real choices you make is taking the side mission A or B, but this does not affect the ending or the storyline. However, this may be changed. Or at least, I hope so.\n\n\nNow, lets talk about the game as a strategy game.\n\nYou play on a hexagonal grid, giving orders to your units and taking turns. There's a good variaty on units, and the game is quite challenging. You need to know how to use your different units to achieve victory. Or, altenatively, you can take down the difficulty level, if you are just interested in the story of the game.\n\nThere's also the option to upgrade your units, and it's really intersting how the upgrades you buy affect your overall strategy. The upgrade system works pretty well, however, I don't think some of the upgrades are balanced at all. This is a ver minor issue, though.\n\n\nI'd like to mention that the soundtarck is outstanding and really enhances the game. The artwork is also really good.\n\nOverall, this is a good game, and I'd recomend it even if it wasn't free. The fact that you have to pay nothing to play it is mind blowing, and it's a must get.","December 28, 2014","true","10.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

GG WM (Well Made). 5/5\n\n^ and that is the tl;dr of my review.\n\nCombat (Captain Mode) 5/5\n\nCaptain mode is the Normal mode for this game. Out of 2 playthroughs (twice thru the 1st arc, and once thru the second arc), I can say I had no great issues. The last fight in the 1st arc was a fun challenge. Gameplay changes quite a lot depending on your unit investments (you spend cash earnt from scrapping enemies on weapon damage, accuracy, energy usage, HP, EP, and more). I usually set up my ship to fire two rounds of kinetics per turn. In the second arc, there are two battles which will feel impossible (and will be if you don't have the support units for it). The 1st difficult fight (in the second arc) is one of the three side missions. Do the other two first to rack in the cash. Then you can beat this side mission with enough game knowledge. The second hard mission, is just that there are TOO MANY ENEMIES! I mean seriously, TOO MANY ENEMIES JUST TO AMBUSH ONE CARGO SHIP! I WANT TO KNOW WHAT IS IN THAT BLOODY SHIP! Honestly though, the combat is fun. There are also 6 difficulty options that you can change in game, so if you get stuck on a mission, you have an easy way out. Or if it's to easy for the master tactician, then you can go be a flippin' space whale.\n\nCharacters - 4.5/5\n\nPotential Waifus are all great. If you aren't happy with any of them, ask for a refun- Oh wait, it's free. Free Waifu is good Waifu.\nSeriously though, from justice loving, to perverted, to tsundere, to childhood friend, to shy, to patriot, and all the way to "I only live to fight"; You have a large variety of waifu candidates.\n\nStory - 4.5/5\n\n*Prologue Spoilers*\n\nYou're a Captain who's just minding your own business, testing out a prototype ship (welcome to Mass Effect, the VN. Comes with extra waifus), when the USSR invades. Nah, just kidding. It's just a lot of angry people being told that they should be angry at everything, and to vent that anger by shooting space lasers and rail guns at everything that isn't them. So, after a massive capital ship called Legion singlehandedly rips apart your local fleet, it then nukes your capital city. Obviously, you can either die fighting or live to fight another day, so you run for your mfern life. Then you gather allies (waifus) from all over the galaxy to smash the angry peasants that nuked your home. The story is enjoyable though. I enjoyed it.\n\nStyle - 5/5\n\nStyle? You have a kick-♥♥♥ ship, space lasers, space whales? Huh? Anyway, you have your own robot-piloting, waifu army. These bad girls have lasers, rockets, rail guns, swords and sidearms. They also disable capital ships, snipe rocket frigates, and download enemy porn collections? Urgh, that stupid pervert. What I'm trying to say is that this game is great.\n\n\n\nSince it's 100% free, get this awesome game.","October 9, 2014","true","27.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So here it goes, ahem....\n\nSunrider is a storybook game with simplistic strategy elements, if you've ever wanted to play out a Space Mecha Anime now's your chance.\n\nThe story is the highpoint of the game. Taking you from one point to another as the captain of a new starship that's been expelled from its homeland. The plots twists and turns between the moral dilemmas you must navigate. Do you stop the slave traders whole will be vulnerable for a limited amount of time and free innocents? Or do you attack an outpost of the enemy that attacked your home world that will be ripe for an assault before the relief fleet can arrive? This is one of many choices you will have to make, weighing in your fight against the enemy, the morality of your choices, and how your crew may become enraptured or disillusioned in the struggle based on the decisions you make. This makes them hard to make and that's a good thing.\n\nThe characters are one dimensional at first, fitting into their respective tropes and cliches. You've got the by-the-books First Officer, the ditzy and childish ace pilot, the shy and reclusive tech genious, and so on. Over time though the characters grow and overcome their mistakes and past demons. I personally found myself looking forward to each chapter to not only see where the story was going (and believe me it hits you hard at times) but how the characters would react to it. It really brought a new dimension to the game that I found extraordinary for the FTP indie game.\n\nThe gameplay when it comes to space combat is simple at first: you have weapons and defenses, some are better at taking out certain units than others and so on. With every new chapter you get introduced to a new element added into the gameplay; new weapons, defense systems, units, scenarios, and an ever increasing (to the point of classic Nintendo level frustration at times) keep the combat relatively fresh and interesting. I will have to say that I found it to be the weakest factor of the game, due to lag in the combat system itself (though Python isn't known for being the smoothest of code when run, it's still a factor) and the voice work, while not bad at all for semi-professional or amateur work can become repetitive due to the repetitive nature of the gameplay.\n\nLast thing I want to mention is the soundtrack. It's gorgeous. I don't know of another way to put it. Each track fits the scene you need. Is the game trying to stress the struggle in life and death combat? Here's a score that gets your blood flowing. Need to make it a solemn and tormenting moment within the ever cracking psyche of a character? Have a eery and sorrowful piano arrangement. Need to emphasize just how ridiculous and lighthearted a scene is when your perverted doctor tries to give one of her "exams" to your character? Welp here's something to draws you out of the first 2 and into the new scene. It's a stellar job and a soundtrack I'll listen to outside of the game.\n\nOverall it's a stellar game for a FTP and an unexpected jewel that I'm glad I found. The artwork is gorgeous and really fits the space opera/mecha feel it's got going for it. It'd recommend this to anyone fans of these themes and to those who enjoy a good sci-fi story with a range of silly and dark topics.\n\nWARNING: There are a few scenes that are adult themed, and while they're few and far in between they might put some people off (though the fact that there's war an genocide is totally nothing to worry about /s)\n\n9/10 would bang my keyboard in frustration at the combat and have the story force me to feel such potent feels again.","November 3, 2014","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I truly do - you've got a semi-decent battle section, and I'm a sucker for sci-fi settings. But I can't. Why?\n\nIts too cliche.\n\nNow, I know, this is a free game, and I'm not expecting Mass Effect; plus, pretty much everything has one or more cliches in it. The whole attacked-on-the-first-day thing, for example, I can ignore. What I'm talking about are the anime cliches - they're simply too much.\n\nFirst off, we've got the situation that Shields' childhood friend is the first mate. Yeah, okay, we can be flexible with our disbelief and let that pass, but its still pretty contrived.\n\nNext, tying sort of into the above, there's girls everywhere yet no man in sight beyond the captain himself, like a harem show or game. Nothing can justify this; even games like Tokimeki have the "male best friend" character.\n\nAdding to that, the uniforms. First Mate Aya wears a uniform that's believably military, and so does Captain Shields, even if his has buckles all over the place. Virtually all the other characters? High school uniforms. Yes, folks, you heard that right - a stereotypical anime high school uniform on board of a starship.\n\nDo I even need to go over mecha in this game? There's literally no reason for it to exist; even their combat weaponry are pretty much replacable by the in-game enemy missile frigate and bomber!\n\nLast but not least, I've got a major complaint about the characters overall; they're incredibly one dimensional, to the point where you can explain their entire personality in a few words. Such as, "childhood friend," "not!Rei Ayanami," etc. You can't connect at all to the characters, because they have nothing unique to connect to.\n\nHonestly, these anime cliches and the space opera setting mix together about as well as oil and water, which is a shame because it would be excellent otherwise, especially for a freeware VN. Something I'd like to point out here though, is that visual novels are just another form of gaming/entertainment - you don't have to use cliches from the animus or mangos to make it, or even do it in an animesque style! This was probably designed to attract a certain group of people, and considering the amount of positive reviews, it did it well, but in the end there is a ton of wasted potential, which could have opened it up to a larger audience.","March 13, 2015","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a good plot that entice for multiple playthroughs, and a realy nice strategy with difficulty ranging from Extremely easy (for those only interested in the story), too Hard (enough for the mind to heat). Cutscenes are Hi-Res and beatifully animated, so are the artstyle (although not all may like it). Not to forget, the soundtrack is amazing.\n\nAs much as i love it, the game has small issues. Sometimes the game crashes or lags in cutscenes which can be annoying. they are patching it so, perhaps by the time you read this it may not be an issue.

The characters are pretty good, I mean they have their tropes but that's to be expected somewhat in Anime. As long as they are unique in the end it's somewhat good. The writting here is mediocre, it's there and it is like a tool. It achieve's it's purpose. The overall story is creative, but harder to emerse yourself in the overall universe. It's hard to believe the beginning the corny start.  Now it's a lot better then many other stories out there, mind you. It's not completely horrible. Some of the characters have completely compeling stories. 2.5/5\n\nThe gameplay. The gameplay is pretty good, the gae has a strong strategy element. It may need a few quirks here or there. 4/5\n\nBugs. THere are a couple of bugs, which make the game hard to play especially if your computer is lagging. It doesn't have a lot of lag, unless your computer heats up. Which is not because of the game. It's because of Windows 7 getting old. Anyway the game itself has some errors clicking and sometimes the links don't work. Using a mouse in this game can be awkward so use your trackpad in bootcamp. 3/5 (It's not like they ruin it's more like a nusiance.\n\nAudio. I will admit the lines in the story can get old, you can tell they have some of the same actors. Those actors are pretty talented, and it's nice that they have audio! Having a few more would be nice. I also think the music can get repetative, it's something of a fine line. I like the music as it contributes to the overal story. 4/5\n\nSome of the visual graphics actually create more appealing characters and the scripting of the storyboard is highly sophisticated for a visual novel. Whoever made this understands how to position the characters at the right time. The character designs are perfectly creative and unique, the style is new and fresh unlike some styles which after awhile the manga/anime start to copy because of it's favorite in a genre. This cuts that red tape. 4/5\n\nMinor irritations and alpha/beta edits. The explosions need to be automatic or a video, it's irritating to click and see the same explosion for the same hit everytime. I also have issues with this because you might press the wrong button if it freezes with bootcamp or a older computer.  it would also be nice to implement critical hits into the game but that's another issue for another day. This game needs some extra cash flow somehow. It also would be nice if the story could progress into more side missions which could be released later. 3.5/5\n\nMorality - pshychology invoking/rhetorical questions. The overal story's idea of making you you doesn't seem to fit the story.  For some reason you are outside watching all of this going on. The story needs some additional character backbone to create a fulfilling element for a visual novel. There's no urgency to the story, or actual reason. In some ways that can be a draw because you know "Hey I'm just exploring the universe." I miss a lot of things like the space genre, which is absent on TV, and Sunrider fills that gap somehow in it's corny, awesome strategic way. The game itself I would rate about a 7/10, and despite it's rating I would put it at around among my favorites despite it's poor score. It's\nalso free. So for a free game. This is a awesome start. Whoever made this has skill, and keep it up.","October 14, 2014","true","11.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That causes funny and arkward situations on the spaceship. Music is good, it's suits the game very well. The drawings are nice. The mechs look good and have several small animations. Due to money constrains they could not add more, cause it has been funded by Kickstarter. Althought low budget the game does not feel cheap, but nice en enjoyable to play. The battles require some tactics, it's not just do something and you will win. The mechs and ship can be upgraded with the spoils of war, the money you gain from destroying enemies. During the conversations and actions between enemies and friends you can choose what to say.\n\nOne remark: It would have been great if they chose to implement the basegame as 12 years old and the 18+ as an upgrade. There is an uncensor option somewhere on their website....\n\nOverall a good game.

The difficulty curve spikes wildly and it's very easy to make the game unwinnable without dropping difficulty levels, since there are very few battles to gain money and too many ways to spend it for such a short game. I'm not sure that the upcoming final part will improve on this, but even so the tactical aspects are quite fun to play.\n\nSo why don't I recommend it? To put it bluntly, even by VN standards the writing for this game is truly awful. The plot is composed of every cliche the writers could think of, characters in their late twenties still don't seem more mature that middle schoolers, and the technical writing is also poor. There's a lot of potential here if a quality writer could get a look at it, but as is I can't recommend it, let alone the dating sim that, from the PV, is just as poorly written but without the interesting gameplay.","April 20, 2015","false","11.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The art in the visual novel half is good with the standard anime look but it clashes with the art of the space battles, which although interesting and detailed, are done is a compleatly different style.\n\nThe visual novel half of sunrider is great with interesting characters and a well told story. However the story is only about 2/3 done and ends on a cliffhanger so if that bothers you perhaps it would be better to wait until the story is compleatly finished sometime this year.\n\nThe turn based strategy game half is good but slight balence problems. Battles are strategic and interesting with good weapon variety and challenging battles. The assets used are interesting to look at but audio barks are limited and enemy variety is limited. The game is very difficult, which although mitigated by the difficulty options in the beginning, occationally feels a bit unfair especially in the escort missions.","April 22, 2015","true","19.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Dialog is all well written with many (somewhat cliched) unique characters and interactions.  Main character is not a lout, which is a plus, and while nearly every other character is a girl, only a few are actively throwing themselves at you, and for the most part the main character is too involved in the main plot of them game (which follows a Battlestar Galactica-type story but less grim yet still compelling).\n\nArt is good enough to not be distracting, and the non-dialog driven gameplay is pleasant enough. It is a hex-based strategy game but far less complicated than a Final Fantasy Tactics and generally focuses on shorter battles.  I find it not at all frustrating, but I'm playing one of the easier of the five (!) available difficulties.\n\nAnd it's free!  (Well, it was Kickstarted.) Who can argue with that?  Though the quality of this game has encouraged me to purchase the less-free Sunrider Academy, so as an advertising campaign it is also quite successful.  Give it a try!
