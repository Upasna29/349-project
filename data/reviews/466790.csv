Do not buy.\n\nReview\n\nI have only played PixBit for approximately 15 minutes. Trust me when I say that this was more than enough time to experience the vast majority of what this game has to offer.\n\nI believe in attention to detail. Not as a buzz-phrase used on a job application or resume, but as a constant practice; a continuous process of dotting the 'i's and crossing the 't's. The process of ensuring that a product is held to a consistently high standard of quality, and that there are not any blatant, easily-avoidable errors within it. The opposite of attention to detail is carelessness. Carelessness leads to mediocrity.\n\nPixBit is a careless game. Its presentation is horrid. The title screen, options menu, and stage select interface all contain spelling errors. The menu music restarts every time the player navigates to a new screen. There is no way to rebind controls; indeed, there is no way to see what the controls are by default. General slapdashery is everywhere.\n\nThe game itself is derivative and dull. Select an arena and character, and then use various guns to prevent enemies from reaching the bottom of the screen. That's it. It's sort of a stripped-down, unpolished version of the original Mario Bros. The enemies all look like Super Meat Boy, albeit pounded and stretched into various strange shapes. Most of the guns are useless. The exception is the godlike machine gun, which renders all other weapons obsolete. Enemies are fairly easy to kill. Death comes quickly to the player as well, but it's farily simple to find a good camping spot and fire away at the enemy indefinitely without fear.\n\nThere are achievements and unlockables. However, obtaining these would necessitate a time investment far in excess of what I am willing to undertake.\n\nPass this one up. PixBit is not, in my opinion, worth $1.99.\n\n","May 22","false","0.6"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","15","19","0","1"
