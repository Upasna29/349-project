Well this is like the food that's usually staying still there for you to easily munch on has finally decided to take matters into its own hands. If apples have any hands anyway.\n\nThe overall chill atmosphere and friendly artistic rendition make it a great game to play when you want to take your mind off of tense things and relax. Like after a overly intense CS:GO match that ended up being 15:15. ouch.\n\nPuzzles go up in difficulty gradually, making for a good learning curve and become very challenging by the time you've played it for as much as 40 minutes. After that the creativity and thought put into designing the levels is going to strike you like a lightning during a ice cold thunderstorm. While getting 1 star (enough to go on for the most part) is simple, those 3 stars will prove to be a real challenge.\n\n\nWith the vast variety of levels and its overall amount as well as the upcoming co-op mode that would add even more to the experience, I consider this to be a worthy purchase.\n\ndank memes are also present in the face of pedobear and co.

This did not influence my review in any way.\n\n==========================================================\n---------------------------------------OVERVIEW-------------------------------------\n==========================================================SnakEscape is cute and colourful casual turn-based puzzle game in which you control an apple that has to collect stars before making its way to the glowing golden exit on each level, usually avoiding hungry snakes along the way. I think I got that right.\n\n==========================================================\n----------------------------------------QUALITY-------------------------------------\n==========================================================Graphics - Graphics are colourful, blocky, and cute. Your green apple (a Granny Smith?) is well animated and portrays expressions well: either general happiness or fear, depending on how close he is to being eaten by snakes. The snakes are less animated, and just move around the level with blank expressions on their snakey faces, but they're still well animated and cute.\n\nEach level is shown as a series of floating connected squares, usually with a few platforms populated with blocky scenery. It's a tried-and-true formula and it's done well here, with the platforms slowly bobbing up and down and small animations adding a bit of life to the cartoon-like scenery.\n\nMenus are easy to navigate, if a tiny bit slow, and include large colourful buttons. They're easy to navigate and look good.\n\nThere are no graphics options to speak of -- just the normal Unity detail level and resolution settings -- but the game looks nice and runs without issues on my old gaming laptop, so anyone with reasonable hardware bought in the last five years should have no problem with it.\n\nSound - The music is a mix of ambient and electronic beats and is quite pleasant. The credits don't disclose it as being taken from anywhere so I suspect it's original, in which case I'm impressed.\n\nSound effects are minimal, but sufficient. Your apple makes some cute, worried sounds when the snakes get too close, and there's a Pacman-like 'wubwubwubwub' when you fail a level, which seems fitting.\n\nGameplay - SnakEscape is played through a series of isolated levels in which you must manoeuvre your apple towards the glowing golden exit square, avoiding snakes, dodging around obstacles, and (hopefully) collecting three stars along your way.\n\nYou control your apple either with the WASD or arrow keys, or by using the mouse to rotate the screen until a little transparent apple marker appears on the square next to you in the direction you want to move, and then left clicking. Rotating the screen with the mouse is a bit slow and to me seems to rotate backwards with the default settings, but you can change it from the options and after that it's fine. You can also zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, or toggle an overhead view with the X key, to help you navigate around obstacles.\n\nIn typical puzzle game fashion there are plenty of levels (four 'worlds' of 15 each, I think), and you unlock each level in each world by completing the previous levels or earning a sufficient number of stars. It's a completely unoriginal progression system, but that's fine; it's easy to understand and it allows you to move on to new levels even when you're having trouble getting a perfect three-star score, although new levels require enough stars to unlock that it's easy to become stuck on a handful of levels quite early on.\n\nOh, and I've given an extra plus because each level has a name, which I like. They're not as amusing or crazy as Jeff Minter's classic Mutant Camel level names, but it's still a good tradition to uphold.\n\n==========================================================\n-------------------------------------PROS & CONS------------------------------------\n==========================================================Pros:\n+ Pleasant music\n+ Colourful, cute graphics, with well-presented levels and nice animation touches\n+ Each level has a name\n+ Steam achievements and trading cards\n\nCons:\n- There are some minor errors in some of the level names and other game text\n- Gets very repetitive\n- Hard! Difficulty ramps up quickly and you need a lot of stars to unlock later levels.\n- Snakes don't eat apples!\n\n==========================================================\n--------------------------------------CONCLUSION-----------------------------------\n==========================================================SnakEscape is a nice simple casual puzzle game. It's cute and colourful and looks professional for the most part. It's no contender for game of the year, but it's not trying to be either. Pick it up for a bit of puzzling every now and then.\n\n6/10\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","May 24","true","2.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","7","8","2","0"
