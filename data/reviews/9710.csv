The camera and the attempt of make a 3D game make a damm bad thing, besides,  the developer screwed with the original dub!! Seriously, it's horrible if you compare with the 1st game! And ah, the plot is pretty weak... But ok, still is a Desperados, worth it for 2 dollars (and not a single tip more).\n\n[PT-BR] Desperados: Wanted Dead or alive é um jogo épico, de fato, mas essa seqüência é muito ruim ... A câmera e a tentativa de fazer um jogo 3D fazer uma coisa damm ruim, além disso, o desenvolvedor aparafusado com o dublagem original!! Sério, é horrível  se você comparar com o primeiro jogo! E ah, o enredo é muito fraco ... Mas ok, ainda é um Desperados, vale a pena para 4 reais( e nem um tustão a  mais).","November 25, 2013","false","0.5"," 85 of 132 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","85","132","4","6"

The focus is all wrong, the characters look and sound wrong and the experience is just wrong.

The gameplay is based on its predecessor but with brand new tactical possibilities in a beautiful 3D environment. Switch from an isometric view to a third person view whenever you want; for example, for duels, brawls and shoot-outs. The great variety of settings includes dusty canyons, ghost towns, American Indian villages and forts, creating a breathtaking atmosphere. Take on the role of up to six heroes, including the famous bounty hunter John Cooper, and experience a thrilling story with surprising turns.","November 20, 2013","true","189.9"," 51 of 146 people (35%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","35","51","146","3","0"
