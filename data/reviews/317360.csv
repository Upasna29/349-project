While shooting.\n-Epic possibilities: gunfights while falling off buildings.\n-Everything Max Payne 3 Multiplayer should have been, and much much more.\n-Easy to control and fun gameplay.\n-Uses Source Engine, so does not require high PC specs.\n-Game flows really nicely. K/D is not a concern at all.\n-Slow-mo hability.\n-Feel like you're in an action movie.\n-You can play as Nick from Left4Dead.\n-No knives. Punch enemies to death if the SMG doesn't work.\nCons:\n-Lacks variety of characters.\n-Doesn't have a lot of weapons.\n-Can't think of anything else!\n\nDefinitely worth playing!

You can leap, jump and slide your way across the "action movie sets" fighting the other action movie actors. Three Playable characters, a hand full of weapons, and 5 perks (or classes, styles) allow for a good amount of ways to play. You get points for "style" and whoever gets the craziest kills the most often gets the most points. As an example one of my favorite kills, my rifle was dry so I dropped it and ran towards my opponent. I slid down some stairs, in between his legs and punched him in the testicles, not once but twice and on the third punch someone triggered the slow time ability and my fist slowly but inevitably flew toward his sack with enough force to knock him unconscious, then his body flew of the roof. This is the kind of mayhem that goes down in Double Action: Boogaloo, its one of the most unique shooters I have played in quite some time!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombieplasticclock/recommended/317360/","zombieplasticclock","ZombiePlasticClock","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zombieplasticclock/","218 products in account","The controls take some getting used to, but the game is damn fun once you figure them out.\n\nUnlike most shooters, players have an insane amount of mobility, and the ability to slow time at will. You can leap through the air, powerslide along the ground, and climb ledges. Naturally this degree of mobility will lead to some really awesome kills, which the game rewards you with a second or two of slow-motion. This basically encourages players to not stay in one spot, and kill enemies in very stylish ways.\n\nAnother mechanic the game has which takes some getting used to is random objectives. Primarily the game is a deathmatch, but once in a while the game will give players an objective, such as being the first to reach a specific point, or kill a certain player before the rest. Naturally you are rewarded points by being the first to do so, and can make the difference between winning and losing a match.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, though, and I do have some gripes about it. As I said before the controls are pretty strange, and take some time to figure out. The game teaches various gameplay mechanics and stunts via popup windows during gameplay, which can be distracting. Another problem I have is grenades, especially when paired with the "Nitrophiliac" ability. They're a little too easy to spam, and I was able to get far too many kills with ease by littering the battlefield with them, not to mention that grenades generally are an instant kill. My last complaint is respawning, where instead of spawning in a Team Fortress-style respawn room, you are instead dropped at a random point in the map. And you can bet that generally there will be enemy players nearby. So it forces you to quickly adjust to your new surroundings, and try to not get shot in the back. Fortunately this complaint is lessened by the fact respawning is instantaneous.\n\nFor all it's quirks, Double Action: Boogaloo is a unique spin on deathmatches, and is damn fun to play. And the best part is that, despite being a Free to play game, there is no "Pay to win" element that plagues other f2p's on Steam. There's a lot of players, and the developers are teasing at new content on the horizon. Basically, it's a game I find very easy to recommend.","October 27, 2014","true","1.1"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","46","54","0","0"

If you ever wanted to be in a ridiculous John Woo movie, this game is for you. The controls are responsive, hit reg is solid even during lag spikes, and every weapon (including your own fists!) feel strong like they should. You can even change between third and first person\n\nOn occasion you will encounter bugs, but they aren't anything game breaking. At the very worst, someone can just kill you or you can commit suicide to get out of them. The spawn times are very short anyway.\n\nLevel design is great. Plenty of things to vault over, take cover, slide under, and flip off of on every map.\n\nSlow-motion is a very awesome feature. Everyone gets slowed but the person who triggers it isn't slowed as much. There is the reflex perk that increases this too.\n\nThe perks are nice additions to support different play styles.\n\nScoring is only dependent on points, and you get these points by completing the random objectives or dealing damage/scoring kills in very stylish ways, so it's a breath of fresh air from the bog standard K/D/A.\n\nAgain, highly recommended if you're a John Woo movie fan or like games like Max Payne.","October 23, 2014","true","2.5"," 38 of 44 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","38","44","0","1"

Not sure what to say about this one. Think "Discount Max Payne" and by discount i mean free, completely free. That's a pretty good start. In Double Action you choose from one of 4 preset characters (One somehow Nick from Left 4 Dead 2) select 2 weapons for your loadout, and then duke it out in a free-for-all against a ton of other players. The scoring system is based on "style points" you get those by doing trickshots and stunts like diving, flipping, sliding, slowing down time, etc. The person with the highest style points wins the match. Also a neat feature is the ability to switch between first-person and third-person view modes, although third person really feels best. There's only a handful of maps at the moment, and the matches sometimes feel like they drag on forever, but it's pretty fun for a free game.\n\nPROS\n+ It's completely free, no microtransaction ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t\n+ Is very fun in small bursts\n+ Max payne anyone?\n+ Specs are low enough for older machines\n\nCONS\n- Matches feel like they drag on forever\n- Lack of game modes\n- Graphics are very dated\n- Needs more Maps/Characters/Weapons\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nIf you like Max Payne, If you like Free, and you like shooting things, give it a shot. Dont expect too much from it, but from what it delivers, it's very fun, very simple and tons of people play it from my experience. I cant really give it a rating since it's a completely free game and it's fun enough to give a shot.\n\nRecommended/10","November 7, 2014","true","0.3"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","41","51","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashdash4/recommended/317360/","bashdash4","Gotta go fast (until sunset)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bashdash4/","67 products in account","---UPDATE----\nIt looks like weapons balancing has been fixed! All the weapons feel great again, and everyone gets a grenade again. Spawning has also been fixed somewhat, but though I'm no longer getting spawn killed, I'm still spawning close to war zones a bit too often. The style system is unchanged, and though I now understand that the devs were likely trying to reward slow motion solely for high flying/risky kills and such, I still don't like it. I'd rather they award 1 sec slow motion for each standard style kill (headshots, tacticool, etc), and then reward 3 seconds for riskier kills.\n\nI am receiving another random issue. Sometimes, the game will decide to freeze up for a few seconds during gameplay. I don't know if it's because of latency or the game's performance itself. If this is only happening to me, that'd be kinda weird, because I use a top performance PC. But if it happens to other people, hopefully it can be fixed.\n\nIt's as fun to play as the beta again, and with its style system, interesting game type, and beautiful maps, there really isn't a reason to try this game again or for the first time!\n\n---OLD REVIEW---\nThough there may have been a bit of bias, since I am friends with a developer and I've been watching this game almost since its inception (and became the undisputed best player, though now there is much steeper competition giving me a huge run for my money), I was originally going to recommend this game hands-down, but after taking a bit of a look after it with the updates and the huge increase in population, I've found there are some problems with this game that make me give it the "yes" vote only slightly.\n\n-Spawn positions need to be fixed. Especially in the newer maps, I am often spawned into the middle of a war zone and get killed within a matter of seconds without being able to even fire a shot\n-Weapons need to be rebalanced. Originally, coming in with an MP5k and an M16 I was able to compete very well. Now there is a lot of favoritism towards shotguns and akimbo pistols, which have, for the most part, become the most overpowered weapons in the game. To add insult to injury, the M16 is now semi-auto instead of 3 round burst, making it a very weak weapon, even with the added style points, and both assault rifles are now mainly campers' tools, especially since the recoil makes them very hard to use while rushing.\n-They need to make the slow motion system like the beta. No longer am I rewarded for tacticool kills or headshots or other such skill kills. The only shots I'm rewarded for are melee kills and dive kills, and I only get ONE SECOND of slow motion!\n\nI really hope that the game becomes more refined and that the issues get addressed and fixed sooner than later, because from the looks of it the beta version is a better game than the final version. If things get worse, I may end up disliking the game and not playing it anymore, which would be a shame since the game really has potential and I've had many good memories playing it.","December 21, 2014","true","17.0"," 34 of 43 people (79%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","79","34","43","6","0"

In case you're wondering what this is, let me explain. This is a third/first person shooter that is played in a free for all. Objectives will pop up, and whoever gets the most stunt points at the end of the round wins.\nPositives:\n-Runs on source engine so it requires minimal hardware.\n-Encourages users to perform badass stunts.\n-Includes easy to use weapons such as shotguns, but also includes hard to master but powerful assault rifles as well.\n-No ranking system, everyone is on the same ground.\n-Slo-mo in multiplayer. You can use it to create badass moments. No, it does not break the game!\nNegatives:\n-Frames always take a huge hit when I start my first game in a session. I have to leave the game and change my resolution. This is a bug because I increased in fps when I moved up from 720 to 1366x768. You don't gain fps from resolution.\n-There are cases where you will die at spawn.\nI've only played two hours of this game and I can't say how it ages, but it's a free game, so, why not try it?","December 17, 2014","true","9.2"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","13","13","0","0"

This weapon allowed this boyo to camp at the top of all the buildings to the point where the amount of salt being shook on my buddy Covalent led him into a blood inducing rage. He turned the tide of this glorious battle by also using the VINDISALTSHAKER and shaking the salt back into Anthony's ♥♥♥. This led to a full 15 minutes of butthurtness where both of them camped on roofs oneshotting eachother with me standing on the side too spooked to move, you see im REALLY BAD at this game so i would occasionally try to intervene but get SALT FIRED ALL UPON ME and DIE instantaneously everytime. I could recommend this game to any group of friends but never, ever let anyone use the vindicator for a full match, it will lead to a neverending war of intense hatred for everyone where now I am caught in the middle unsure of what to do next, do i use the Vindicator? or do I continue being complete ♥♥♥♥?

Ok I just played my first 2 hours in this game and it is amazing! If you like the idea of cheesy 80s John Woo, Chow Yun Fat, Steven Segal movies mixed with the Max Payne Games than you are in for quite a treat. Its absurdity and nostalgic look is its greatest strength and will make people into that kind of stuff play for hours despite being a bit unfinished. Thus far, for me, I have had no server troubles, lag or inconveniences that would disrupt my experience. The one thing I am hoping for the most with this game is expansion. This game is conveniently coming out around the time of Loadout which has much higher custom ability, several more maps and is also free. So I hope this game does not fall behind due to this because I would love to see this game expanded on. At present, the game has 3 player models to choose from at the beginning of the game, no progression system or customization options (and if the developers see it fit, micro transactions). These I hope will be added later as they would expand player’s desire to play as well as adding new game modes and nostalgic map design. This may seem like a lot of sort comings I am pointing out, but it is my belief that these things will be expanded on later. Despite this I will continue playing and I encourage others to do so as well.

Choose 1 of several perks, choose your weapons, then fly through the air in combat.\nAttack: Left click is shoot, Middle Wheel click is melee, f is grenade if you have it equipped\nStunts: Right click makes you tackle-dive, ctrl then right click makes you slide-tackle. In most cases it is good to always be using your stunts\nShift: more accurate aim, very useful with the Vindicator rifle on the rooftop map\nC: activate slow motion if you have time built up\nB: Switch your weapons or ablility at any time\n\nMy Strategy: Brawler with Vindicator + H.E. Grenade or Brawler with Vindicator + Undertaker\nVindicator is a powerful rifle decent for short/mid range, but great at long distance. Use Shift to snipe a few players before propelling your body head first to the lower rooftop, guns blazing.\nGrenade is good for multikills, and areas where players mosh together, not much else to say about that.\nUndertaker is a fast sub machine gun for close quarters. It works will with the Vindicator in that once you empty the vindicator's clip, you can quickly switch to the Undertaker to get a quick life-saving kill before reloading your primary.\nMELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE MELEE\nDid I mention that you should melee as a brawler? Your melee strength is higher as a brawler, and kills, especially melee kills, build up a brawler bar. Once it is in the 80s or higher range, you can switch to your fists by pressing 1 and then left click. Your fists should be glowing. Now run around spamming left and right click, you will rack up tons of multikills on close-quarter parts of maps, like on Rooftop.\nToday is my first day playing this game, but I have to say it's a good game utilizing the Source Engine pretty will. It's a nice break from more serious shooters, and will surely be one to play with your pals.\n","October 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","0"

If you played The Specialists, this is a must-play, and if you haven't, this is worth checking out to see what an old-school, high-style shooter really looks like.","October 23, 2014","true","1.2"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Anyways. DA:B is a fun shooter with similarities to The Specialists. There is only a multiplayer mode currently. You can select between three different characters: Diesel the Biker, Vice the Detective, and Eightball the Gambler. They don't do anything except look cool. You can select between many different weapons such as the Persuader(shotgun), Undertaker(Uzi), Sentinel 9 and Stallion 45 (both pistols which you can go akimbo), and more.

You might like this game if you like PVP and good at FPS games. This game is for PVP action like the John Wo Action movies. Great for a few laughs too, very funny action.\n\nUses Game system and Server system like Counter Strike Source and TF2.  Has a Stunt system, where you do jumps and slides like in the Action movies. If you shoot and make kills while doing stunts then you get extra score, style points and slow mo points.  Also has a Slow motion system, press slow key and everything slows down around you while you shoot to kill.   This make for harder to hit players especially ones that are using the movement to their advantage.  Servers have some bots to kill.\n\nCons = You might end up using the shotgun the most. If you are too good at playing, you will be called a hacker and ejected.  No manual or tutorial.\n\nfor more info:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bm15fBIyOZc\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBXAgNekzyQ\n\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tag/double-action-boogaloo/\n\nhttp://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/double-action-boogaloo\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/mods/double-action/reviews","July 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

As being based on the mod, it has the same type of John Woo inspired action gameplay and the awesome "slow-mo" effect. While it plays just as great as the original, Double Action has some different mechanics such as killing streaks that give you advantages with "Style" points. It's like a revamp of the former power up/frag point system. Just like the original, it comes with several beautiful and big maps that, despite their size, don't slow down the action. A downside I would have to say is I feel like there should be more characters to choose from along with more arsenal (I believe this is going to change with updates). I also hate the "Boogaloo" part of the name but hey, personal preference. Overall, Double Action: Boogaloo is a solid modification and I would highly recommend playing it.","October 23, 2014","true","7.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

This game is not perfect but its a unique take on the fps genre that they managed to pull off. Even with the small player-base there is always at least 2 servers with enough player to be worth playing, in my experience. The maps are generally good but they're all the same urban-rustic style. The game-mode they do have is pretty good though I wish they had a team game-mode. In all there's only ~5hrs of solid gameplay you will get out of this but ITS FREE","January 8","true","15.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","1"

The game is not for everyone, but for those who enjoy running arround and slowing down time every thirty seconds while constantly trying to kill people with a SMG, or having a battle in a dark room filled with clouds of money, 100 dollar bills that float around as you fire your shotgun madly trying to hit someone, I do recomend this game.\n\nFor a FTP like this, you need to think not if the game is worth your money, but if it is worth your time. And this game is very much worth your time. And it very much is.\n\nCons:\n-A few guns, many of which are copies with different stats\n-It can be hard to find a good server with enough people\n-The graphics are meh, and also not the point\n\nPros:\n-It is free\n-Every build has a place and time to shine\n-Variaty of maps\n-The guns all feel different\n-It is free\n-Runs on my Mom's old laptop\n-Doesn't take itself too seriously\n-No pesky story to get in the way of shooting people with style\n-The AI is both dumb and OP at the same time\n-It is free\n-The shotgun is a sniper rifle","February 20","true","45.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, Here's an option for you! Not saying the graphics are bad, they are actually quite moderate. Controls are very easy to handle & get used to. Easy character customization with an option to select character traits (such as necrophiliac, double-pistols, marksman, etc.) and the animations are actually superb! Plus neat level design, SLOW-MOTION, Third-person AND First-person, (Yea, wow!) parkour is easy to handle, and i believe it's even made on the Source engine! :D\n\nYou HAVE to try this amazing game.

I hadn't had a chance to play the update until today, and I have to say, I'm impressed with the new maps, but the new update is still lacking something the game's needed for a while, and that's a rebalancing. Matches with just a few people can feel relatively empty depending on the map size and density, but another map entirely might feel fine with that same amount. If there are a lot of players in any map things really get intense because you can evade one firefight and end up in another, it's all out warfare, but there's also a chance you can die before you really get to have any fun.\nThe guns are still the same as before the update which I'm disappointed to see, because the Persuader still one shots at mid- to short range. The fun of this game is having an intense ridiculous firefight while diving and sliding around with your opponent in a hail of bullets and trying to keep the reticule focused on them to whittle their health down before they whittle down yours- a fancy DPS race of sorts. All of this fun melts away when you die in a split second because somebody's using the Persuader. I really think it deserves a nerf so firefights with Persuader users can still be fun since you're not dying instantly, more of a challenge rather than an instant death scenario, for both players. I did read that there was an update regarding the Persuader, but it really didn't change much in regards to gameplay, it's still used the same way.\nI've never cared much for the music of the game, as I normally play music from other games while I play. While the music additions are cool and fit the tone for the game well, I probably won't be listening to them any time soon.\nHonestly, I'm really glad this game's still getting attention, even after over a year of seemingly being forgotten by the developers. It's a really quirky and gimmicky game which can make for some really memorable experiences. There aren't many other games where you can say you did a slo-mo backflip off of a wall and riddled somebody with bullets before sliding past their corpse on your stomach into the next firefight.\nOverall, I'm pleased with the new update (balancing aside) and I'm curious to see what future updates can give us. Maybe more characters? A new class? New game types? An offline single-player challenge mode against Bots? Custom soundtrack? It may be a lot to expect from a free game, but a man can dream.","April 1","true","38.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I mean seriously it would have to be really ♥♥♥♥ to hate right?\n\nSo what is it about?\n\nYou do a variety of rolls, wall flips, and slides to take out the other players in a quick and hard to hit fashion.  Unfortunatly this looks more like everyone is just mindlessly sliding but they are still VERY hard to hit if they do it right.\n\nThere is so many ways to play but staying completely still is usually a horrific idea. Keep moving and dodging and people will have a tough time. Getting cornered can usually get you killed.\n\nWeapons are varied but they all seem to be overpowered if used right. I can't argue that it is not balanced because they ALL seem to be powerful if used correctly.(Shotgun users camp doors, Macdaddy users slide in and go for the head, Akimbo users try to be precise, and everyone trys to make the best use of their guns to win)\n\nMaps was not always my cup of tea but a really good map was one with city towers. You could jump from building to building and barely make it. Making for intense gameplay. A lot of times you could nearly fall to your death.\n\nSo overall I think this is a good game. It is free, good, and really deserves your attention.\n\nRating:9.0/10.0\n\n","June 2","true","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You two throw eachother around and try to kill eachother in a bloody, mad and awesome fight. Until he suddenly unholsters his shotty. "I am dead" you mutter to yourself as you blindly throw a grenade to his location. He tries to dive away from it, but it's too late....\n\nBoth of you are sent flying away from the rooftop of the building into the majestic fall to meet Mr.Concrete at street level. While you fall, you start to shoot your nemesis, and so he does until all you have left is your pistol, only carrying one bullet inside. You take your time to aim, 5 seconds until you hit the ground, and shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n\nTurns out it was a headshot, the guy who was previously blazing his guns at you is now nothing but a blood-stained corpse free-falling, and you enter slow-motion in just enough time to sigh, re-think your whole life as the damned Mr.Concrete comes closer. You then drop your pistol and sends it flying to the side while you close your eyes and enter a free-falling pose, your body now being embraced by the concrete, all your bones having been broken and your miserable life extinguished from the face of the Earth.\n\nThat is 2 minutes of what this game can offer you.\n\n100/10, bealtiful frekin' masterpiece.","October 25, 2014","true","5.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Pull of a couple of Rambo moments, then go Matrix on 'em, then dive through the air like Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and don't forget to mention that this is also like an Olympic Sport with all that flipping.

This game is one of the most ridiculous games you may ever play.\n\nThe graphics are pretty terrible for a Source engine, but that doesn't make too much of a difference.  The game itself is not supposed to be gritty, down to earth, realistic, or anything like CoD or Battlefield.  Instead, think of Counter Strike with all the fun mods you could squeeze into it and then slimmed down to only include the ones that make you giggle like a schoolgirl being complimented about by the class clown.\n\nThe game itself is like Max Payne in that, you have ridiculous jumps and dives with a time warp function.  It's like Matrix in that you don't have to even begin to pay attention to ammo count (what is that?)...and time warp function.  You can choose to play first or third person, and the whole game (while still having objective modes) is about running around diving through the air and massacreing 15 other people in the same server as you.  Stupidly simply, simplisticly funny, hours of fun for the whole family.  Have fun spotting the two people having dolphin wars flopping around on the floor in circles trying to shoot each other.\n\nNeed I say more?","November 2, 2014","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Don't judge my review by my short amount of time playing. I have school, so i am busy and never get a chance to play this.. This game is basically Michael Bay producing a game with the help of the developers of Max Payne. Explosions! YEAH! Guns? YEAH! Slow motion? YEAH! Multiplayer? YEAH! Source engine? YEAH! Weird title? YEAH! This game is real good, i didnt waste any time on it, it's still a new game and is getting updated, but it is real fun. It is a game where you run around in third or first person views, fighting people and throwing grenades at them and jumping and rolling and diving and punching people to kill them in 1-2 hits and slow motion-ing (IDC Whether that's a word or not) and voice chatting and meeting new enemies and friends and hitting people with the hilt of your gun and jumping off of stuff, but one thing for sure: This is better than Call of Duty by far. Unless you're talking about Black Ops 2, then that's just a bit better than this... This game is epic and fun and free and you should try it out.

Needs polish but worth a try for the laughs.\n\nI distinctly remember seeing this game several days ago and paying it no mind, thinking it was just a bunch of Source engine trash. First impressions were quite mediocre but I would say the game has very quickly grown on me.\n\nFirst the good. it is legitiamately fun. No seriously, the floaty controls and ice rink surfaces make for an incredibly fast paced and twitchy shooter. Not for everyone but it does appeal to peopel who like the acrobactic martial arts gun-fu style of combat in movies such as Die Hard and The Matrix (Hell theres a Matrix poster in one of the levels...). The gun sounds are satisfying and the animations, while crude, get the job done. The standard deathmatch mode, with all its hilarity, are punctuated by micro-objectives such as a race from point to point or a wanted system. Completing these objectives gives buffs and bonues to the player who won these challenges, adding another dimension to gameplay. The greatest strength this title has is in its hilarity and its lack of taking itself seriously. Surprisingly enough, for a game that encourages player to run around like chickens with thier heads cut off, glitches are not very common. That may be a personal experience however.\n\nUnfortunately the game suffers at this moment from a severe lack of content. With only three playble characters, a relatively small menagiere of weapons and limited number of maps, the game does tend to get boring playing online quickly (I could only handle 30-40 minute spurts before getting bored). Additions of more gamemodes would be welcome as while the standard deathmatch mode is fun; the boring factor does tend to set in quickly.\n\nWeapon balance may also be taken into consideration. The persuader (shotgun) does tend to dominate and in massive battles, it quickly degenerates into a persuader fest. The vindicator (FN FAL) and the Black magic (M16) also are normally not ideal as long range in this game is basically two rooms over, still shotgun distance. The Mac Daddy (Mac 10) with its higher damage and rate of fire dominates the Undertaker (MP5K). The single pistols are useless. Enough said.\nWeapon balance could be tweaked.\n\nThe frantic movement of the player models and such also may prove a heath hazard. I do not recommend playing this game if you easily suffer from any sort of motion sickness. This could prove lethal.\n\nDespite its obvious lack of polish, I still rather like the game. Its not for everyone, fans of tactical shooters such as Insurgency, ARMA and Counter-Strike (I personally dont think thats tactical at all) will most definately not like this. Visually its choppy, laggy and uninspiring. Its disorientating, confusing and infuriating at times. Gameplay wise however, it offers something that you just dont find in F2P games these days. Did i mention it was free? The Developers obviously have put quite a bit of love into this game and I am personalyl interested in how they will take this game.\nIn the end, despite its faults (and there are many...), I do recommend picking this up to mess around with friends on a private server. The results are just...magical.","October 31, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That blew my mind!\n\n\n"What's the difference?"\nHow can you say that?\n\n\nOne job forever?\nThat's an insane choice to have to make.\n\n\nI'm relieved. Now we only have\nto make one decision in life.\n\n\nBut, Adam, how could they\nnever have told us that?\n\n\nWhy would you question anything?\nWe're bees.\n\n\nWe're the most perfectly\nfunctioning society on Earth.\n\n\nYou ever think maybe things\nwork a little too well here?\n\n\nLike what?

You have to be bred for that.\n\n\nRight.\n\n\nLook. That's more pollen\nthan you and I will see in a lifetime.\n\n\nIt's just a status symbol.\nBees make too much of it.\n\n\nPerhaps.

What's available?\n\n\nRestroom attendant's open,\nnot for the reason you think.\n\n\n- Any chance of getting the Krelman?\n- Sure, you're on.\n\n\nI'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.\n\n\nWax monkey's always open.\n\n\nThe Krelman opened up again.\n\n\nWhat happened?\n\n\nA bee died. Makes an opening. See?\nHe's dead. Another dead one.\n\n\nDeady. Deadified. Two more dead.\n\n\nDead from the neck up.\nDead from the neck down.

It has guns! Lots of guns!  During a regular game, you will die a lot and kill a lot in style. Its less about getting the most kills and more about doing the most stylish action. Jump at a wall, dive away from it and blast your opponents with a machine gun to get style points.\n\nSometimes the game will start a race between checkpoints around the map.
