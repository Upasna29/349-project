There are some flaws though, and in my opinion the good outweighs the bad here. Wanting to just play though the game, I built ships how I would like to. But the games restrictions are just too much. Add too much and you get a bad grade, which in turn will hault your game upon any boss because you need better ranks on stages. To get better ranks requires boring and tetidious rearranging and picture perfect accuracy. Upon reaching the last boss, the game wanted me to go back and get 15 more stars before I could beat the game, and that really ruined it for me.\n\nMost of the time the game just left me stressed and frustrated. There was only one time where I really felt enjoyment in the game and it's upsetting to say so, because this game looks promising, but it fails to deliever the joy and fun I've had with other indy games of this style.\n\nIf I could play the game how I want to, this game would be worth it. But with the restrictions and constant remindering to go back and get better ranks at stages you've done before, I'd have to recommend a pass on this one.","April 30, 2014","false","3.9"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","1"

Enemies seem to choose their targets at random between tries and the targeting mechanisms are very frustrating. Not even the walkthrough designs will help you 3-star levels in this random mess of a game.

Build your own battle bot kind of games like this seem to be a lot of fun until you find out how limited, frustrating, or poorly they realized the ideal.  This one highlights the lack of multiplayer as soon as you get bored with the puzzle aspect.  I have nothing in general against puzzle games, but i hate to see great ideas like this being relegated to -just- another puzzle game.\n\nBuy it on a good sale if you really want it, otherwise don't bother.","December 4, 2013","false","0.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

The tiny bit of novelty in making your own designs wears off early and is quickly replaced with a sense of agonizing boredom as you rebuild your ship from the same base over and over and over for every level. Enemy AI seems target at a random. This is a good game in small doses, maybe 20 - 25 minutes at a time. Wait for a sale though, $9.99 is too much for what you get here. If you see it for 75% off, go for it.","January 11, 2014","false","2.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are 37 levels in total, and the ships you build are only to specifically fight the enemy(s) of each particular level. Nothing is carried over besides unlockable (over various) parts for your ship.\n\nFor me, it was interesting at first, but grew tedious as I had to reinvent my ship for every stage, and was left in severe want of a free-form/sandbox stage to build an all-purpose mega-ship or an inpractical behemoth of my own.\n\nOnce you finish the stage, there is little left to do except to replay old stages to get a higher rating (done by using less materials and guns). It took me 7 hours to finish this game, and while it was an initially fun experiment/distraction, I wouldn't recommend that you pay full price for this.","May 1, 2013","false","7.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

You pick parts/build it, and set it to battle...thats all. You can not control the unit afterweards...just sit and wait to see if it won or not, if it did you go to the next round vs another "harder" AI oponent...it gets tiresome quite quickly...I would say its a pass unless its on sale for less than a buck.","December 29, 2013","false","0.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You build up and add to a basic wood ship and put your death machine against other ships. Its great fun and a real challenge to think where you need to reinforce your machine and what kind of weapons you need to equip to defeat your enemy. The game doesn't have a really great story but the gameplay if fun. The game lets you build machine like ships that can get outrages if you really put your mind to it. I really enjoyed this game and if you have a building and constructing kind of mind then you would enjoy this game too. I would wait for a sale though before getting it as the game is short if you are good at building things up.","October 1, 2013","true","3.5"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"
