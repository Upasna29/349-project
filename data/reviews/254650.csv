"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/recommended/254650/","cosmicengine","Cosmic Engine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cosmicengine/","309 products in account","http://youtu.be/EYpBwld_a7A\n\nWarhammer 40k Storm of Vengeance is a lane defence strategy game developed by Eutechnyx. Eutechnyx themselves were originally founded in 1987 and their previous titles include The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift, Big Mutha Truckers, NASCAR and did I mention Ride to Hell: Retribution.\n\nThe general premise of each battle is simple. Send units to destroy the buildings on the enemies side. Once you have destroyed the buildings you capture the lane. To win a battle capture 3 lanes while making sure the enemy doesn't destroy yours. Each unit and building costs redemption points to produce. Buildings like communication relays build up your redemption points over time. So the idea is to have some redemption production buildings and some unit producing buildings at any one time. There is also the resolve resource, through the skill tree you can unlock special units which cost resolve to field. Resolve is accumulated by turning one of the unit production building into a resolve production building, which halts unit production. While the game may claim to have strategy in reality there’s little to be had, once you grasp the mechanics and limited upgrade system, you can easily win battles without having to put any kind of concentration in what so ever.\n\nIn between battles there is a progression system where by you can unlock new units, upgrades and special abilites that use the redemption resource. The progression system is very simplistic and there is no real meat to get your teeth into here, its a very straight forward system that offers little to be excited at. You end up playing the game on fast speed because there's no real reason to watch everything at normal speed, I don't want to see the same battlefield background and same kill animation over and over.\n\nThe major issue I have with Storm of Vengeance is that it is lazy and not just lazy, it's lazy to the extreme. Storm of Vengeance's mechanics are an exact and I mean exact replica of Eutechnyx's previous mobile title ninja cats versus samurai dogs. The only major difference between the two titles is that storm of vengeance has slapped some 3D models in there and covered itself with a Warhammer 40k skin.\n\nStorm of Vengeance's story follows the events of the Dark Angels defence of Piscina IV against the green skin tide of the orks. While the story is interesting and is in cannon, it again feels lazy with no effort to make it even slightly entertaining, I mean hell, you didn't build the mechanics from the ground up so why not put in some effort into voice acting or something to make it enjoyable, it just looks and feels poorly executed.\n\nJust because you slap a 40k skin on something doesn't make it codex astartes material. The game lacks any resemblance to a real Warhammer 40k experience and because of this it feels like a blatant licensed cash in. This game could literally be anything, you could place any franchise skin over this game and it would be the exact same.\n\nNow putting the repetitive mechanics and lack of actual strategy aside for one moment, there was also a wee bit of controversy that needs to be discussed. When Storm of Vengeance originally hit steam, I like many thought it was the actual release. Then under closer inspection, the title had beta written at the end. Oh, so it's an early access game I thought, nope. So wait you ask, your saying they just released on steam with beta tagged on the end of the title? Yes pretty much, I couldn't believe it. The first thing I couldn't believe is that Steam allowed that to even happen, if a game is not complete it goes through the early access program, full stop. Second, you cannot just throw beta on your title and expect that to save you from criticism. Even worse the developers at first said there wasn't time for the game to go under early access, which as we know is now utter bull ♥♥♥♥ since since a backlash they quickly went to hide under early access. That kind of thing is seriously dodgy stuff, as a developer you should know not to pull that kind of ♥♥♥♥ and you should definitely know that if you do, your going to get called out on it.\n\nAnyway back to the actual game. The thing is with Storm of Vengeance is that its fun for about 10 minutes and then after that it's not. It's a shallow mobile title and that is exactly what is should only be, a mobile title. This is not a core gaming experience that fans of the franchise want, what it is however is something to pass the time on the train to work. Look at it this way On Steam Storm of Vengeance costs £6.99. On iOS and Android it costs £2.99, for the exact same game. So if you want to get it, but it on your mobile device and use it as a superficial time passer.","March 26, 2014","false","2.2"," 67 of 73 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","67","73","0","0"

Its one unit at a time, or a couple and thats it.  If the menu was the game a controller would be useful since that is the only place where the controller works, way to go Eutechnyx.  The name of the studio who made this tablet port garbage is Eutechnyx.  Try saying it.... "Eutechnyx".  Ugh, it sounds like that noise cat's make when their coughing up a hairball, or that garbled sound right before you puke after a few too many on a night out.  That puke on the floor is this game, its a game vomited onto steam with no connection to the warhammer universe or any of the fun.  After about ten minutes you will want to trigger your own gag reflex to get rid of this game.  The space marines are puke green, and the orks are puke green, with its brown poo covered background it makes for a work of art made of poo and puke.  Why did the dev stop there?  Why not just call it a day by adding festering maggots to the mix or whatever else is gross that makes you wanna throw up.\n\nThis game is a perfect metaphor for being drunk.  Met some person at a bar or in this case a game, looked pretty awesome, then ya woke up and realized what a bad decision it was to get this game.  Theres not enough alcohol in the universe to make this game any good, getting alcohol poisoning then having your stomach pumped is the equivalent of this game.\n\nThis game deserves an orbital bombardment of cyclone torpedos from an orbital platform performing the rites of the exterminatus!!!\n\nRating:  0/10  Value:  $0.00","August 10, 2014","false","7.4"," 78 of 92 people (85%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","85","78","92","5","5"

It managed to be quite dull, unimaginative, and repetitive as each mission required you to place buildings which will build units that you then assign to lanes to attack enemy structures. This wouldn't be so bad if the game weren't so ponderously paced and there were more than 2 useful units. I didn't use assault marines at all throughout the campaign. Also, a good number of the upgrades for your units are essentially useless, and trying to put more than one upgrade on a marine at a time is tantamount to a death sentence because of how drastically it increases their build times.\n\nMy overall impressions of this game are very poor. I understand that it's still in beta and there will be tweaks, but all in all I don't have any faith that this project will improve enough to make me want to play it again. It's dull, and not even the beloved Warhammer 40k license can change that. If anything, I'm disappointed that it's a 40k game. If it weren't, I probably wouldn't have even given this game the benefit of the doubt and saved myself $10.","March 4, 2014","false","4.0"," 41 of 44 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","41","44","0","1"

I wanted, so very badly to enjoy this game.  I picked it up because the Dark Angels chapter never received enough love in my eyes.\n\nFirst the good news: The storyline and written dialogue is spot on. The game offers pretty solid 3D animations, except with noticeable glitches. The fundamentals of the gameplay are actually pretty awesome.\n\nNow for the long-winded "But,": There are simply way too many interface bugs which force the player to restart what could have been an otherwise good match. These experiences become more noticeable and frustrating towards the end-game where every move really counts. You hope to sweep down the line of maurauding Orks with a heavy bolter, all of the sudden you are unable to click on your unit. The interface doesn't offer the user any notice of when their unit has been interrupted by an enemy attack, leaving you clicking wildly at buttons which should be greyed out.\n\nThe 2D interface felt splotchy and rough, with misaligned text noticeable everywhere on smaller resolutions.\nThe cross-platform and multiplayer features do not function as advertised, with the multiplayer servers down.\n\nThe icing on the cake is when you finish through the entire Dark Angels campaign:\nThe game's singular achievement does not trigger, even if you 100% every bonus mission.\nDon't pick this one up any time soon, unless it receives some serious update love.","February 8, 2015","false","14.5"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","29","32","2","0"

No card game mechanics, no strategy to speak of whatsoever, this is immensely disappointing. The gameplay is stale and boring, with the creation of buildings leading to the deployment of units in up to 5 lanes. There are some minor variations, but nothing really worthwhile. A lot of this is also actually RNG-based instead of revolving around any worthwhile strategy.\n\nThe lack of depth and progression is only matched by the fact that the skills and abilities are nothing spectacular either.

It has bland sound effects, and the graphics are dull with neither using to any potential the richness that could be put in considering the source material around which it is themed. Ignoring the WH 40K theming the graphics are still, especially the backgrounds , dull and the sounds bland.\n\nOver all the game is not as much fun as some free to download TD or LD games.  The usage of Warhammer 40K imagery is irrelevant as it ignores the mythos created around Space Marines and treats them as literal cannon fodder (or like Imperial Guardsmen for the WH 40k fan) to be wasted in useless lane combat.\n\nI would say at best i would give this game 4/10 and that is because I am a fan of Warhammer 40k and so just skinning it to represent the noble and glorious Adeptus Astartes gives it a few points.\n\nI must add an addendum now though.

Oh, nevermind, it's called DLC now... DLC for a game thats just been released can could use all the help it can get, and its behind a paywall with a game thats already overpriced for entry simply for being a PC port.\n\nShame on Games Workshop for having little care of there franchise to green light this, Shame on Eutechnyx just in general and shame on me for buying this game before doing the research or waiting for more reviews, dont make the same mistake i did, you want a good warhammer game?

I found out afterwards that this is basically a reskin. To be honest, I'm a huge Dark Angel fan, and I've played them faithfully since the end of 2nd Edition. That's the main reason I tried the game out. Aside from being massively repetative with only the simple strategy of unit rushing a basic, unupgraded marine, I felt the game had some promise. It needed a major mechanic tweak to make upgrades and special abilities worth while. As it is, you have to choose to build or to use global abilities. Since global abilities are supposed to augment your main units, you end up massively handicapped if you bother with them.\n\nStill, with some updates and more units, I felt the game would have some life and value in it. Then, they released paid DLC. This  buried any hope the game had. You can get a decent mobile game for $2.99. This is a mobile game on your computer for $16, and it still isn't complete. Why would I do that when FTL and Starbound are cheaper with a million times more content? This has one map and 100% existing artwork .The only thing unique is the very few 3d models in the game. And of them, almost all are on the Dark Angel side. Orks get generic boxes for buildings (you'd think they would get battlewagons, death rollas, etc). It also doesn't follow lore. Dark Angels don't have Stormravens.\n\nBottom line - Stay away.

A Plants vs Zombie like tower lane game!!!  I know its only in "Beta" but its pretty good so far and for the price, I would have kinda rather payed $5 or $8, I still think its not too agressive.  If you love PVZ and the brutalness of Warhammer 40K then this game is for you?\n\nAlso be noted, THE GAME IS IN BETA! Honestly yes, at the moment there is not that much of a challenge, but I enjoy it for what it is. Also, the graphics aren't great but I have played worse Warhammer games honestly...and I really dunno who approved the making of this game but reguardless of what other people are saying I likes it.\n\n...but then again also I found out it twas Eutechnyx Ltd who made this game, kind-of-a terrible game company.  Only thing they have under their belt is NASCAR/racing games so...did not know that until after the fact...should I be ashamed for kind of liking this?  And should I be worried for the slippery slope for future Warhammer games.\n\nDear gamesworkshop,\nSTOP GIVING AWAY YOUR LISCENCE OUT TO ANY DEVELOPER!!!\n\nThank you.\n________________________________________________________________________________\nUPDATE: 11/14/2014\n\nSo about the above review...I was very high when I wrote that.

The problem may be this being a 40K title the expectations are for something grand, complex and epic like the Dawn of War series but this is a simple to play Plants vs Zombies tower defense of game which has been ported to Steam from the mobile devices.\n\nThough it is a casual and lane based game it does provide a decent amount of enjoyable challenge and there are plenty of upgrades, units and sprecial abilities to utilize these can be upgraded as the game progresses. There is a good story between each of the battles that tell the story of an Ork invasion of an Imperial colony world that the Dark Angel chapter of Space Marines and an Imperial Guard regiment (Imperial Guard being available as DLC they are well worth getting for the entirely new story, units and gameplay style), the story is well written and true to the 40K lore.\n\nThe graphics are nicely crafted and do a good job of portraying the grim wartorn 40K universe and the units are well animated, everything looks the way it should given the limits of a casual  2D game of this type.  The music is suitably operatic and over the top epic in style much like a DoW game and the sound effects are authentic and really add to the atmosphere of an intense battle taking place as well particularly the voice samples of the units, there is nothing better in a 40K game than seeing a Space Marine swaggering onto the battlefield shouting "Xenos scum!" or "Greenskins!" at a bunch of orks before blasting them with his bolter, that's really what 40K is all about at the end of the day and that's what this game delivers succesfully.\n\nSo everything you would want from a 40K game is here in essence providing you understand that this is a casual game you can play for 10 minutes now and again and you're not looking for the full DoW experience.","February 11, 2015","true","24.8"," 7 of 33 people (21%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","21","7","33","2","0"

It's good for when you're too tired to play a "serious game for serious gamers" but still feel like venting off some steam. Personally, I was a bit on the fence about whether or not the price was justified, and at launch there was certainly a reason for outrage. Presently my doubts have been assuaged, as the beta has progressed and features were added. I don't know the story behind why this game was originally launched as a complete game with a Beta tag in the title art, but ultimately the team conceded to the demands in the forums that it be marketed as an Early Launch.\n\nWhat I do know is that the dev team has waddled through torrents of hate and vitriol in the Steam forums searching for feedback and answering back constructively to a community that by and large has shown them nothing but contempt. I don't know if they're the same individuals responsible for Ride to Hell: Retribution, a fact which people have fallaciously used to damn the game by association. I've seen them take a serious approach to improving the game they've made based on user feedback that isn't pasting a certain video by a certain celebrity or slaughtering the game based on some imaginary quality barrier set by "the community" for video games based on the 40K IP. Personally, I think that speaks for itself regarding their commitment.\n\nThe reason I'm recommending the game is as a way of vouching for the team's continuous dedication to the betterment of this project. Note that at this point, there will be bugs of varying degrees of severity, and you have the Early Access joy of reporting them and assisting in their squashing. This is obviously not something everyone will enjoy. Likewise, if you absolutely loathe the concept of a lane defence game you will probably not enjoy this. But if you're at least partially willing to give it a try regardless of the vocal detractors, I assure you this game is worth the benefit of the doubt. It certainly won't demand a lot of your time.","March 8, 2014","true","23.8"," 14 of 105 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","14","105","0","0"

It's currently a small lane strategy game, but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be brought. It has a decent selection of skill tree development and, whilst I don't take much of an interest in the more complex lane strategy games, I did find Warhammer 40,000: storm of vengeance to be a nice game for a reasonable price. I think that the large number of negative comments for this game have been awefully misleading, as it is still in development but I could easily see this game being released already so I will be looking forward to seeing what else Eutechnyx add to it. Overall, it's not a typical Warhammer 40k game, it's not big and flashy with many different factions but I do believe it to be a good, quick little game that isn't too much of a difficulty to learn or play.","March 22, 2014","true","20.9"," 8 of 98 people (8%) found this review helpful","8","8","98","0","0"

Once this game is released from beta and completed I think that this will be a fun game to play when you either don't have the time or patience to sit down for some hardcore gaming, or when your at work doing a crappy job you hate.  As to the 40k universe being involved I have yet to see anything that would really make this feel like a Warhammer 40k game.  Most of the gritty and dark aspects of the 40k universe are toned down to make the game more viable mass market.  this style of gameplay could be done with anything and it would not be any different which means to me that the universe is simply being used to sell copies to GW fans like me.\n\nFinal thoughts is that if you are lookin for a casual time waster phone game and willing to beta test an unfinished product it is worth your time. however if you are looking for the next big game in the 40k universe, or something with that same level of story and gameplay as past warhammer 40k games you will be disappointed.  Once again this is a phone game in beta even though the devs should have put it in early access area.","February 28, 2014","true","1.4"," 16 of 134 people (12%) found this review helpful","12","16","134","0","0"

In some games this would just be an annoyance but in this game it's much more.  A number of actions in this game take multiple focused clicks to work and they are in real time. For instance, to throw a grenade you first have to click on the unit with the grenade and then click on where to throw it. The problem is that when you click to throw it if you click on an invalid area (and for abilities that focus on another unit 99% of the screen is an invalid area) then the original action is unselected and you have to start this multi-part action all over. Add to this how often you click right on another unit and it doesn’t register and this is hugely frustrating. Mind you, this is real time so missing an action can easily cost you a round.\n\nThe other large annoyances are have no indication of when a special action is available, meaning you have to constantly flip to another screen to check it, and that units you control are notably weaker than the same units when the AI controls them (which says to me they couldn’t get the AI to work well so they weakened the player’s units to compensate).\nThis game has real potential and I kept going back to it to see if I could find a way to make it work. Ultimately, however, it became so frustrating I removed it completely from my computer.\n","August 7, 2015","false","12.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Let me say a few good things mixed in with a lot of bad:\n\nthe gameplay isn't special, but it's fun for a bit. The game claims to be a card game, but it's not at all.. Just ignore that. The whole game is a lane-train where you march your guys down lanes through enemy guys until you destroy the building at the other end and claim that lane. Do this three times and you win. There's a small modicum of strategy to this, but with the amount of RNG in this, your best strategy is just ramming most of your troops down a lane until it breaks. Rarely will you do anything other than this. The game's sound effects, poor graphics with a number of clipping and hitbox issues detract from the experience. attack animations are totally out of sync with projectiles and sound effects. On top of all this, the story could be compelling, but it is unengaging and boring because of how it is presented. It's just a number of back and forth conversations presented in crude textboxes with no sound or visuals. The campaign battle map is useless, do nothing for the game. It attempts to at least show you where the fight is taking place in relation to other locations, but with zero indicators or landmarks on the map, you will have no idea where anything is. In combat, there are a number of glitches that are especially annoying, such as how the interface loses functionality over time and buttons stop working regularly. There will be times when you will be trying to redeploy a dark angel on the brink of death and he will die because you're furiously clicking on his body, but the redeploy won't go off.\n\nDO NOT BUY ANY DLC. NONE OF IT'S WORTH IT. THE SKINS LOOK TERRIBLE AND THE NEW UNITS SERVE NO PURPOSE AND SUPPORTS A PAY-TO-WIN THEME (DISPITE THEM BEING USELESS). THE IMPERIAL GUARD ARE TERRIBLY DESIGNED AND GIMPED, WITH MANY FUNCTIONS STRAIGHT UP NOT WORKING.\n\nAs for the two core races.... eh. The Dark Angels are fun to play, with a handful of different styles and focuses to try if you are interested. They are definately superior to the other two factions. Their abilities and units are very powerful, with enough variety to be ready to respond to anything the other two factions have with speed and effectiveness. The orks are very difficult to play competitively, as since they need a build to make troops and a second build to make upgrades for them, they are unable to make the number of troops they would need to balance the flexibility of the space marines. There's more, but that's all I'm going to bother saying. I had a bit fun with the game, and played it a lot. But, bottom line, it sucks.\n\ntotal score 3/10","June 29, 2015","false","20.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And more or less no challenge at all. I have finished most of the original campaign and were watching movies in TV at the same time...
