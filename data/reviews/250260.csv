It's kind of an action adventure with one of the strangest settings I've seen in a game. The biggest plus in this game is the humour. The game is one big joke (in a good way ;)  ). I've been laughing out loud a few times while playing this game, and this doesnt happen often to me. Does Adult Swim ring a bell? Do you like absurd humour like Robot Chicken? Then you should really check this out.\nOh, and it has one of the coolest intro's I've seen in a game. Who needs cinematics when you can make something like this?\n\nFinished it in about 3.5 hours\n\nThere's not much to say else then spoilers, so I leave it at this. It's definately worth checking out!","February 4, 2014","true","9.3"," 299 of 341 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","299","341","0","7"

You play in a first person perspective, interacting with several things, exploring rich, colorful, living, breathing surrealistic areas. The surrealistic art style blends with the humor really well. The only controls are jump and action buttons with left stick to move, and right stick to look around or keyboard controls to do the same things. You can get items and switch between them. There are plenty of mini games that feel more like diversions to keep you engaged. Its parodies of other games and media, yet it feels distinctly like its own product.\n\nYou work for a spy agency that sends you to far away locales with serious objectives, things like infiltrate a USSR building, follow a cowboy in Japan to get his mechanical kidney, infiltrate a criminal's lavish retro penthouse and you'll even be sent on a Polynesian vacation. There are spies, madmen, robots, crazy bums and women around every corner.\n\nThe big feature here for me is the interactivity and exploration. You can interact with boxes, newspaper machines, spray pigeon perfume on NPCs to see pigeons carry them away, drink mouthwash only to discover its chlorine, use a master baster on a turkey, freeze a frozen meal in a microwave, scribble lipstick on your face, collect spiders in a jar to throw them at people, break every vase in a shop trying to swat flies. It all feels so interesting and engaging to do what I want to in this crazy world. While NPCs are faceless box people (or robots) with circle heads, NPCs say several things, most of which are hilarious and I don't usually like comedy in games. The eccentric off the wall comedy and parody really hit the mark for me, when most comedy games feel forced.\n\nJazzpunk parodies several games like Frogger, Wave Race in a fountain of gravy, mini golf with pool cues, virtual tennis, Wedding Quake against a bride, groom and priest, a zombie pizza game, a high score game where you play a cat ripping things to shreds, a game of Twister, finding prizes with a metal detector and so much more. It all kept me playing, even if it all was just easy fun.\n\nIt is definitely worth a playthrough, I found myself taking far too many screen shots at the crazy things I'd see. Things in the background, men in cullender hats with wheeled pigs on the background and my radio tooth on the floor. Its never in your face, its all just there for you to find it.\n\nThere is no death in the game, even if you plunge off of the fourth floor of your Polynesian hideaway, you still bounce on the ground. With that being said, you can still fail the mini games. Frogger took quite a beating and I lost a lot in Wedding Quake before I realized the rose rocket launcher was win. It is an easy game, again, the point is to explore, interact and laugh.\n\nIs it worth the $15? Maybe and I'm surprised to say that, even if its only 2 or 3 hours to complete. The ending came pretty abruptly and even the credits have their own flare to them. I can imagine its not for everyone and I never thought it would be for me. I am shocked at how much enjoyment I got from Jazzpunk and I might have to play through it again.","October 29, 2014","true","2.8"," 136 of 144 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","136","144","12","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/recommended/250260/","BavarianGod","[AReV]BavarianGod","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BavarianGod/","3478 products in account","The 1960's were a strange time, atomic paranoia fueled the cold war as the space race allowed mankind to make monumental leaps forward technologically. Global espionage was the tool with which the cold war was fought as agents from both of the world's super powers battled for information and technology. Amidst all of this, counter culture exploded and use of psychedelics became a new past time. Jazzpunk uses this period of time as an aesthetic springboard for it's comedic hijinx and in doing so plays out like an episode of Saturday Night Live with an overarching theme to it's skits.\n\nIt would probably be most appropriate to categorize Jazzpunk as an adventure game, as players are placed in the role of Polyblank, a secret agent who is dispatched from an abandoned subway station on various missions by a character known as The Director and each one of these misadventures is kicked off by swallowing a pill. The narrative is flimsy, and each mission plays out almost like a skit. An antagonist is introduced in the later missions and helps provide some closure to the game's events. Jazzpunk focuses more on humor than plot and it makes this the kind of experience that you turn on, tune in and drop out of. It assaults players with non sequiturs and irreverent easter eggs. Players can expect to stumble across a frogger style mini game, wander around in an Evil Dead inspired setting made out of pizza, play mini golf with a James Bond style villain and beat up a passenger car Street Fighter II style. It's a tribute to all things nerdy with plenty of tech based humor and refrences to other games. The Adult Swim style humor, a style that makes it seem like being in an altered state of consciousness is a prerequisite to enjoy, is likely to put off many.\n\nAlso potentially off putting is just how easy the puzzles are in Jazzpunk. Most players will find themselves progressing unopposed since most levels are as simple as following the instructions laid out in the objectives screen. There are a handful of side quests but they have no bearing on the proceedings and generally exist to provoke a few laughs. Some of the diversions like Wedding Quake, a wedding themed spoof of the classic arena shooter may hold players attention for a decent amount of time but the whole of Jazzpunk lasts a few hours at most and offers little replayability. Think of Jazzpunk as more of an alternative to watching a comedy film than a game poised to occupy a dozen hours of your life. It could be argued that Jazzpunk is most rewarding when you are avoiding the critical path since interacting with random objects and poking your nose around generally uncovers the best easter eggs and gags.\n\nThe aesthetics of Jazzpunk leave a favorable impression. Seemingly modeled after Thirty Flights of Loving, it employs blocky characters with simple animations and cell shaded styling. The funky soundtrack adds to the unique flavor of the game making it feel like nothing else as well as helping sell the off beat humor. The aestetics, soundtrack and gameplay click together like legos, delivering a unique experience that in spite of the fact that it borrows liberally from other works.\n\nJazzpunk is kind of a nightmare game for reviewers... To describe it in terms of the quality of it's gameplay, visuals and the amount of time players can wring out of it simply misses the point of the game. Potential Jazzpunk players should think of it instead as an interactive comedy experiment. An off beat experiment. While it may not stand out as a great game it is a little experimental indie gem that may have an impact on the humor and style of other titles. Turn on, tune in and drop out.","May 1, 2015","true","6.0"," 73 of 78 people (94%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","94","73","78","4","2"

In this Alternative Cold War world, everyone is a robot and everthing is vibrant and full of energy. It’s a very simplistic style but everything is delivered in such a tight manner that it still manages to ooze style.\n\nI actually find it hard to describe what Jazzpunk actually is as it exists as a pastische of many other gameplay styles. First Person Shooters, arcade games, golf games, tennis, survival horrors, all fall together like an Andy Pollock painting and it just...works! What could be shallow gameplay expereinces as bolstered by dialogue that is so hilarious it could make Rob Schneider actually appear funny.\n\nThe dialogue is hands down some of the best I have ever heard. I wouldn’t be able to fit in the amount of jokes and sight gags that made me really laugh as that would basically be the entire game, but trust me when I say that you will WANT to talk to all of the inhabitants in each level as each reels of some excellent quote fodder.\n\nI fully recommend this title and anyone looking for a fresh experience filled to the brims with laughs will not regret picking this up. Jazzpunk is alone in what it is and therefore the best at what it does\n\nFULL VIDEO REVIEW HERE - http://youtu.be/-1zz4v5FXE4","February 5, 2014","true","2.3"," 109 of 144 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","109","144","0","0"

You are introduced to its Adult Swim-esque humour when your Director requires you to sit on a whoopee cushion in his office that is situated in an abandoned train cart before he explains your first mission to you. Jazzpunk gives you the feeling when you find a secret room or an easter egg in other games, except this time it lasts the whole game.\n\nYou’ll pillow fight a girl out of a window. You’ll be kissed by a homeless guy. You’ll dig up Han Solo, squirt pufferfish poison into people's faces, shave a man with a weedwacker and have to make your way through a crocodile person’s digestive track.\n\nThe game seems to be set in an augmented reality based in the 1950’s, an odd and never done before combination. Each chapter of Jazzpunk is fairly open world and requires you to complete an assortment of random tasks using your creativity in order to progress. While these tasks do push the plot forward, they seem only to motivate you to explore and find the secrets and jokes that Necrophone Games have hidden throughout the game.The gameplay is simple and you cannot lose, even when you actually are. After you finish the game you get the option to replay each chapter separately if you’re looking to get those achievements without having to repeat the entire game. In a game dependent on the ‘wow factor’ keeping you entertained the first time you play through it, it’s a wonderful option and certainly is a positive.\n\nWe all know that achievements games are sometimes tedious and boring. Jazzpunk has somehow managed to make theirs funny and worth playing through the game again to achieve them all. One of them requires you to dial certain four letter words into a phone booth, while another requires you to paralyze yourself after jumping from a diving board.\n\nThere are multiple mini games you can complete ranging from zombie pizzas, a cat simulator where you need to destroy expensive items to Wedding Quake (where you kill brides and grooms in order to stay single and collect powerups like a pre-nup) that will keep you on your toes and entertained.\n\nAlthough the last chapter of the game falls short and feels a little disappointing, Jazzpunk is still overall a hilarious game, and everyone should give it a shot.\n\nIf you'd like to read more reviews from me, join my steam group!","November 15, 2015","true","3.5"," 50 of 54 people (93%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","93","50","54","6","2"

So put on your crazy hat, sit back and enjoy.\n\nYou are Polyblank who is sent on missions to recover some stolen goods and discover some things are not what they seem. There is voice acting while words are projected onto the characters and areas around the screen. You can do weird things like clean out a guy’s bat ears with a giant q-tip you find on the ground. Many funny stuff happens in this game that had me laughing many times. My kids watched some of it too and really got a kick out of it. Why not get in a pillow fight and knock the girl out the window or spray pigeon perfume on someone and watch the pigeons attack. These are just a few funny things to see.\n\nThe game is short though and can be finished in about 3-4 hours but that won’t take away and fun or experience. The $15 price tag is a little high but if you catch this on sale pick it up because it is a great game to experience. I would have loved to play more and hope maybe the devs will put out some add-on content or maybe a sequel. Probably won’t happen but I can always dream. It reminded me of Thirty Flights of Loving with its art style and somewhat similar story telling. Also if you are an achievement hunter they are all pretty easy to achieve and also fun to earn.

Is it a game? Let me explain.\n\nYou're a special agent, and you get missions to achieve. Until stuff happen and you have to save someone (I won't spoil it).\nYea, the story is pretty weird and not much clear, but it fits into the game perfectly.\n\nThe style its pretty simple and cartoonish, but really original and good looking, the settings its like a 60s spy movie, with all the prerecorded sounds you have heard in a lot of classic movies (yes, they have the Wilhelm Scream).\nThe humor is great. I love it. It kinda feels a little bit like a Monty Python adventure. It's all set up to take you by surprise, and it works super-well.\n\nThe gameplay itself it's pretty easy, a sort of first-person adventure game. Even tho looks easy, it's a lot of fun to play. Expecially if you have to pick a nose to open a door or stuff like these.\n\nThe music is probably the main problem. I mean, it works a lot since it all sounds like a 60s movie, but it's way too ripetitive and loud.\nAlso, it is pretty short. It only took me 2 hours and a half to finish it 100%. And that's a shame, I was seriously hoping to last at least around 5-6 hours.

Though there's lots of self-aware comedy and surreal interactive weirdness thrown in too, kind of like the movie Top Secret or The Naked Gun meets the games Panic! and The Standley Parable. Sort of. Honestly, Jazzpunk is unlike just about anything I've played.\n\nYou play Polyblank, an agent for some kind of agency, based in an alternate-universe cyberpunk Cold War. Oh yeah and there's some random jazz thrown in there as well, hence the name. Random seems to be a word thrown around a lot when describing this game, and for good reason: it's all over the place in its references and absurdist humor. And while it feels a bit ham-fisted at first, like it's trying to set a world record for most pop culture references per square meter, I found the experience to be thoroughly enjoyable after I completed a mission or two. So yeah, what happens is that you'll be given increasingly bizarre missions every so often, which is done in increasingly bizarre ways. Sometimes it'll be as simple as infiltrating a soviet installation or tailing an American, other times you'll have to do something like catch and roast a robot pig or exterminate rogue microchips in a kitchen. While you can just go from point A to point B completing your objectives, you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice, as it's all the stuff in-between that really makes Jazzpunk a worthwhile experience.\n\nBeing in a cyberpunk world filled with robots, the references to nerd culture are all over the place. Gaming culture as well, with minigames like Wedding Quake, an homage to Quake III Arena where you shoot wedding party members with champagne and collect prenup agreements. And a reference to Street Fighter II's car-smashing sequence, but done in the first person and with just a bit more humor. Things like this are every few steps in this game and it just put a huge grin on my face. Most of it's not laugh aloud kinda stuff, but I can't help but love bits where you find a 3DO console in the sand, or have to pour coffee onto a Commodore PET to proceed. Granted, it risks alienating some players if they're not familiar with these in-jokes, but with as wide of a spectrum as the comedy covers, chances are you'll find something in here to make you laugh, or at least exhale sharply and chuckle to yourself. I honestly don't have any noteworthy complaints about the game, just a couple minor things like some objectives being a bit obtuse to figure out and the humor being hit or miss depending on individual preferences. Also, there's the game length. You can complete it in about an hour if you just speed through it, but you'll miss a ton of awesome stuff. It takes two and a half to three hours if you take your time, so Whether or not the game is worth the asking price of $15 is up to you. Personally I found the game to be a breath of fresh air and I had a blast just wanting to see what absolutely freaking strangeness was coming up next. So if you see anything you like here, why not give Jazzpunk a shot, especially if it's on sale.","February 13, 2014","true","3.0"," 26 of 31 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","26","31","0","1"

This game...is...a....trip....super bizarre. Funny as hell as well. Kind of buggy, but not game breaking buggy. Sort of a Hunter S Thompson novel as interpreted by Adult Swim...sort of. I would absolutely recommend this for people who want to experience something completely unique and interesting. I suspect every experience playing this game will be fairly unique given all the various things available to experience during a play through. I think my own weighed in at around 3 1/2 hours or so, but I also didnt do everything in the game. You could literally take in the visuals for a couple hours if you really wanted to.\nSo, definitely play this, but also track the technical issues thread in this games community hub.

I could say it's a psychedelic love letter to obscure references; an outrageous consolidation of ridiculous moments and hilarious dialog, brought to life with a bizarre art style and deadpan delivery. But what is Jazzpunk really? Well I guess it's all of these things and so much more; an barrage of creativity held together by forces beyond our understanding. It's insane and absurd, and I love it so much.\n\nSet in an alternate history Cold War era Japan, you take on the role of Polyblank: espionage extraordinaire, who has been contracted to obtain confidential information from a top secret soviet headquarters. Utilizing prescription medicine and his many skills, from being able to speak to inanimate boxes to throwing popcorn on fellow theatergoers, he's the obvious man for the job and perhaps the only sane person left in this world (assuming he even is).\n\nFrom the opening moments (which are absolutely brilliant, I might add) Jazzpunk pulls you by the throat down its rabbit hole of computer puns, pigeon degaussing, stick people, and Hunter S. Thompson. It's a mad, mad world that revels in its own absurdity and pulls it off with a consistency and potency that defies reason, but proves nonetheless hilarious and even nostalgic, pulling and referencing things I thought I'd forgotten so many years ago.\n\nJazzpunk exists in a vacuum of its own insanity; a colossus monument to the sheer power of imagination, and perhaps the closest thing to a videogame cult classic I've ever seen. I have no doubts that there will be people that "just don't get it", find it too simple a game, or otherwise fail to appreciate its genius and that's fine. It isn't a game for everyone, but for those that harbor a love for technology jokes, deadpan humor, and the plain bizarre, Jazzpunk's surreal brilliance is hard to miss.","August 15, 2014","true","4.3"," 24 of 28 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","24","28","0","0"

It reminded me a lot of those games like Gus goes to cybertown I used to play as a child, where you would see a screen and click everything to make funny things happen. Only in this, you're exploring a 3D space in the first person perspective and the humor is more adult.\n\nI definitely liked exploring all levels and "clicking" everything to see what would happen. Sometimes you click something and a sperarate minigame with a twist starts. At one point you open a pizza box and start a kind of survival game with pizza zombies. Some might say that they throw those in your face too often, but I liked it. When I finished the game, I went through it again to get the achievments I hadn't yet gotten and discovered a lot of small things I didn't even think to do on my first run.\n\nThe only reason someone might not like this is if it's not their humor. I guess you could just look up gameplay of the very beginning, and if you even have to smirk about it, you should get this game.","June 9, 2015","true","4.5"," 18 of 18 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","18","18","0","0"

Jazzpunk is a cartoon. There are games with cartoony graphics, some that are actually based off of cartoons, but Jazzpunk is straight-up Tex Avery. If you've never heard of the guy, you're missing out. He directed a ton of hilarious shorts back in the mid-20th century that still hold up today. His directorial style resulted in wacky, off-kilter, crass, and sometimes totally ridiculous cartoons.\n\nThere is a plot to Jazzpunk, but it's designed solely to set up as many gags as possible. Apparently you're a spy, and your mission is to infiltrate various locations and steal super-important stuff. I can't say much else because, since this is an interactive-adventure game, it'll ruin a lot of the jokes & surprises. I can give you a vague idea of what to expect though. Almost every chapter consists of an area you can explore. There are objects and citizens you can interact with, and there's some very light puzzle-solving as well. Everything is set up as part of the experience, so whatever happens you just roll with it.  It's impossible to die and there are no fail-states for your mission, so there's no sense of danger or urgency.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a very short game. Anyone should be able to get all of the achievements in less than two hours. There are plenty of secrets and things to try at least, but that's still less than four hours of game-time. If we're speaking strictly in terms of value, you don't have to look hard to find titles with more game for less money. However if you, like I, happened upon this game due to its appearance in a bundle, then I definitely recommend exploring it.","November 4, 2014","true","3.2"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","24","29","3","1"

TIME IS PROBABLY AROUND 4-5 HOURS.\n\nSo, games and comedy. Sometimes that is an absolute MESS of a combo. A combo which should never work. But Jazzpunk. Wow, does this game do such an amazing job of it. The comedy in this game is crude and sometimes dark. But the comedy aspect of the game just works!\n\nAlright, so walking away from the comedy side of the game, let's consider the actual gameplay. The gameplay is smooth. I mean, really smooth. This is one of those games that you could honestly just play again and again because of the controls. The turning is responsive, the controls are tight and stiff. Just amazingly well done with how they made the controls work.\n\nAs you progress in the game, there are no massive learning curves or any new "gizmos" which can help you. This is no way makes the game boring. The game always has something to keep you on your toes, be it trimming a man's back hair or just putting lipstick on your character to glamourize yourself. Speaking of the game having no "learning curves" I deem it important to tell you all that the game has pretty much ANYTHING you can do. Hell, there's an achievement for just freakin' using a metal detector and finding treasure! And what does the treasure do for you? Nothing, zilch, 0! And is it good? Hell yeah it's good! The ability to do those quirky little things just for the sake of it is totally unique and something that is rarely done in games.\n\nSpeaking of that, most games will have you do some grindy-bore-fest task just to get yourself some better gear or loot. This game just allows you to do it for free! You can choose to do it, there's nothing to gain OR lose from it. And that's good. It rewards players with an achievement - which most people don't care about, so they don't have to bother with it. I know this is sounding like a ramble now, so let me sum this one part up.\n- Doing things for an achievement is good.\n- Making sure that the game isn't grindy is good.\n- Not making the player more powerful for something that they can do which others may not want to do.\n\nThis game has side missions. And do you get any neat items from it? Nope! Anything at all? Well, yes. A few have achievements which is why I did them, so there's achievements for all you achievement hunters. Speaking of achievements, this game is perfect for all you achievement hunters. The achievements are easy to get, fun to achieve and actually feel rewarding. The game will make you go out of your way for some and others.. Well for others you just gotta play the game!\n\nThis game, is just breath-takingly unique. The comedy element is just too well done to the point that you don't get sick of it and you don't feel like you want more. There's a perfect balance of gameplay and comedy. The game doesn't shove the jokes in your face going "LOOK WE MADE A FUNNY, WE EXPECT YOU TO LAUGH," instead they make it so that you know the joke and that it's going to bring a small grin to your face. Be it the cheesiest joke ever, or a woman falling out a window from a bomb-♥♥♥ pillow fight!\n\nSo, do I recoomend this game? Yes. 100% YES. Honestly, if you're looing for a game to spice up your library and make you giggle like an idiot for a few hours, get this game. Sure, it's short but it has a bunch of replay value and side missions. The achievements are fun to get and easy to get, so yeah. Get this game for a memorable little gem.\n\n\n\nEnjoy the review? Please consider checking out my curator!

But after the first mission, it became clear that the game is just a bunch of random places that is just a pretense to make a lot of jokes on the side. The actual "game" and "fun" of Jazzpunk is to check every object and NPC in the game, to hunt for all the jokes the developpers added.\n\nThough some of theses jokes did made me chuckle, none of them stick as particularly witty or worth remembering. Also, many of the jokes are a reference to something else (most notably 90s video games), so are only funny if you actually share the same reference. I suspect people younger than 20 years old will actually miss many of the jokes, just because they don't share the same references.\n\nThe overall story and the missions you're supposed to do just feel like a todo list to complete and unlock another place full of side jokes. Since you're eating hallucinatory pills to get from place to place, anything is "acceptable", and the overall world is mostly a bunch of unrelated places strung together. The first level is probably the best one, and the more crazy the game gets, the less interesting it is.\n\nThankfully, even if you spend time trying to find as many of the hidden stuff as possible, the game shouldn't waste more than 4h or 5h of your time. I was very glad it was finished, and i don't plan on coming back at all.\n\nPS : Warning, i got motion sick while playing this game (especially during mission 1), and after checking the forum it seems that I'm not the only one : several people experienced the same thing. I don't know exactly what causes it, but it's probably due to how the character moves in a very colorful world.","December 2, 2014","false","3.6"," 43 of 69 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","43","69","3","1"

It's good to play alone, it's good to play with a couple of good friends watching and it's VERY easy to spoil if you saw everything beforehand somewhere on youtube, so just jump on it.\n\nI'm very sensitive to music, style and pacing in modern games, because a lot of times all of that is so "wannabe", This game is,,, pro. It's simple and it is an instant pleasure for every game/PC/tech geek about 20-30 years old.\n\nBottom line!\nBasically, it's jack in the box.

It reminds me of that, but a little less tight. There’s just a little bit of puzzle and minigame holding it together, but mostly it’s about poking everything to see how it reacts. It’s one of the only comedy exploration games I can think of.\n\nSome jokes fall a little flat, but it ranks super high on jokes-per-minute. There’s definitely a lot that caught me by surprise for a chuckle. The use of cartoon sound effects and physics slapstick are perfect. I like how the game references are lighthearted puns and not malicious jabs.\n\nThe story has a nice flow to it.

Perhaps if I didn't spend so much time the first play through doing this, I may have considered revisiting the games areas to find new things, but even if that were the case, you're still not going to get more than a few hours worth of entertainment from this game.\n\nThis is the main reason why I cannot recommend this game and my reasons are bias, I grew up with the majority of online games being the free flash based games, in which just as much effort was put into making games that could keep you entertained for a few hours, and have huge replayability, and these were uploaded for free to many free flash gaming hubs, for people to enjoy. I feel as if this way of experiencing games online is shifting, as many indie developers make these kinds of games and sell them for $10 or more rather than making them available to everyone. This game in some respects is an exception, it is extremely well made and thought out, and I would definitely pay money to play a game such as this, but is it worth the full retail price of £11? No, definitely not (although that might be a subjective viewpoint). This is one of those games that you really have to get on a sale when it's down to £4 or something that reflects it's price better. What I expect from a game that costs more than £10 is something that will keep me entertained for roughly 20 hours +, something which a lot of indie games fail to provide unfotunately.\n\nIf a lot more time has been put into expanding this game into many more levels, to bring it up to the quality we expect from a good video game, and what those who grew up with gaming have come to expect, then certainly this game could be huge, instead it simply leaves memories in my mind for a few weeks and then it sits gathering dust in my steam library as i fail to ever find a reason to replay it again. For all these reasons I cannot recommend it at it's current price.\n\nI will however go on to say that this is definately a game you should play at some point, if you can pick it up for cheap, for it is a really entertaining and quirky game which rewards you exploring and trying things you wouldn't normally do in video games, if you're a fan of exploring games and trying to unlock everything and see everything, this game is packed full of all those kinds of easter eggs, mini-games and many cultural references that will keep you entertained and hold your attention for a whole playthrough, it is a game that is not very hard at all either, and is all round a fun experience playing it. Some may find some of it's humour a little too over the top, but I feel that there's something in this game that everyone can enjoy.\n\nThere is not much to say beyond that, the game levels are very interesting and vibrant, the crazy story adds some sense of progression to exploring the mad levels, as well as the achievements which convince you to fully explore and enjoy the game, all round it is a great game and I just wish it could have been longer, adding atleast 8 hours worth of gameplay, rather than the 2-3 hours that it provides.\n\nWill I play it again? I highly doubt it, maybe in the distant future.\nDid I enjoy it? Very much so.\nWould I recommend it? Not at it's current price, but get it on sale and you won't regret it.\n\nA rating out of 10 - 8.5","October 15, 2014","false","3.2"," 41 of 70 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","41","70","0","0"

Unfortunately, it didn't live up to my expectations. I'm all for bizarre and wacky gameplay, but the lack of any deeper overarching storyline or humor to tie it all together quickly makes the game bland, predictable and forgettable. If you're the kind of person that finds endless video game and pop-culture references hilarious, I could probably recommend this game to you. If not, I wouldn't pay any more than a few dollars for the cheap laughs you'll get out of it. It's also very short. You'd be lucky to get more than 2 hours of gameplay out of it. Having said that, the art style is pretty cool, and "Wedding Quake" was quite fun. 2/10.","February 9, 2014","false","2.8"," 28 of 46 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","28","46","0","5"

Like many of Adult Swim Games' works, Jazzpunk's gameplay is supported mainly by its comedic factor. The end result is a somewhat shallow, yet still entertaining game. As Agent Polyblank, you travel the world collecting sensitive materials, thwarting other spies and engaging in general mischief. Though the sidequests offered by the game are enjoyable, the main plot itself can be finished in an hour or so, a glaring example of Your Mileage May Vary. None of the puzzles are remotely challenging and the game is more or less a Walk To Goofy Setpiece simulator with a few minigames that merely distract. Though the game ends quicker than a run to the Post Office, the jokes are somewhat funny in that Adult Swim brand of humor. Once again your mileage may vary and after the humor the game really doesn't have much going for it. The art style is abstract and engaging, but the world itself is more or less dead and roughly the size of a football field. Before you know it the level is over and even the few 'sidequests' in the game add little substance. That being said, the game is pretty funny, but it begs the question "Why did I pay for this?" Even at $15 (or $12 at the time I write this) Jazzpunk seems way too expensive for what it is and feels more-suited to the Flash Game crowd rather than a standalone title. In conclusion, not a bad game, but not worth the money.","February 8, 2014","false","2.7"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","0"

If you don't dig dumb and downright stupid stuff like Tim and Eric or H3H3 then this game will undoubtedly make you angry, and the humor is the main if not only selling point to this.\n\nThere are some performance issues which I can't find anything addressing them. Huge frame drops down to 3 a second happen randomly seemingly unrelated to what's going on but this doesn't impact the enjoyment.\n\nGreat art style that is incredibly unique best described as "jazz punk" - an abstract Cold War inspired world that is complete nutters. Take the Philip K ♥♥♥♥ view of the future and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ize it with inane humor and an espionage feel. Honestly I haven't seen / read / or otherwise experienced a style like this, with the closest being the humor of the earlier Fallouts.\n\nThe humor is the main drawing point. Without spoiling too much there are some sequences that are just ridiculous and well executed that tap the dumb humor appeal. I've taken 461 screenshots of occurrences, conversations, scenery, etc. - stuff like depressed talking boxes, this recurring hobo character's conspiracy theories, stealing money from a jazz player to put in a sex robot, or a plant saying it's a political prisoner. I digress, but I could go on and on about the humorous moments and not do them the justice they deserve. It really needs to be experienced fresh and I could definitely see someone being disappointed if they've seen videos longer than 10 minutes of this.\n\nThe only points of contention would be the length, lack of replayability, and price point. Due to the style of game it is, essentially an interactive comedy game with 4 or 5 levels with little to none replay value since you can easily explore everything the game has to offer the first time around and the second time knowing all the jokes. While this is bad for some games, I don't find it that much of a downside. While I would love more to this, I am satisfied with the time I had. While $15 would be too much in my book, the common sale price of 75% off is super worth it.","January 28","true","4.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

And while the art and sound design both are amazing, it ultimately falls short in gameplay, narrative, and cohesion. After the more than stellar introduction to the game’s world, players spend the rest of this two hour long spy comedy pretty much walking around while the premise disappears further and further into the background and the jokes start to wear thin around the middle of it all. Players slip into the role of secret agent Polyblank in a Cold War-esque world and have to retrieve things from the enemy so his organization can do other things. None of it matters, however, as players will shortly lose investment in the story altogether.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679453147\nJazzpunk lacks an appealing game mechanic but also misses both agency and payoff to compensate for that – meaning that at the end, there is not a whole lot to talk about. Around the third mission, Kai Tak Beach Resort, things start to turn dull as players realize that they have basically seen everything and that the game is not headed anywhere. There are no puzzles, perils, or high points. The areas feel disconnected, talking to non-player characters leads nowhere, several gags are not linked to anything, and some of the quips don’t have any punchlines to them, with a number of them simply referring to things that only make sense if one knows the source material. The Frogger, Space Invaders, and Wave Race segments try to bring variety to the monotony, but end up feeling very alien, as if they are only in the game because the developers knew how to program them.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679453308\nConclusionNecrophone Games and Adult Swim Games did a phenomenal job with the audio-visual presentation of Jazzpunk. Sadly, as there isn’t anything to do in the game, there also isn’t too much to revisit or to remember either. In my initial playthrough it took around two hours to complete the story and another 2.3 hours to play through it again, this time getting the achievements I missed and attempting to get out of bounds. The game definitely starts off strong and maybe future titles will be able to build on that momentum to create a truly great experience.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=679453254","May 6","true","4.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

With advertising as confident as it was, it looked like it would be a pretty solid title, despite the fact that it was never disclosed exactly what you did in it. The trailers showed a few setpieces and environments, the screenshots showed a large world to explore and the key features mentioned "Half a dozen jokes" and an original soundtrack. I was never hyped for the game before release, and only heard of it recently. So when I went into Jazzpunk, with no expectations or knowledge of what it was and came out disappointed, I know something went wrong.\n\nThe first ten or so minutes seemed promising. A well done intro set up the tone and feel of the game, but never did anything with them. You spend the mission faffing about in environments with a multitude of things to do, but with none of them interesting. While the tasks themselves resemble point and click adventure games in which there is little logic and a lot of dull things to do, the humour is referencial and circumstantial. Go to a cinema, annoy the patrons while watching a repeated advertisement from the 1950's. Go and spray people with bird pheromones, watch them get covered in birds. Go and contemplate how dull this game is, then listen to the same looped track for the fourth time. In these sections, there is nothing of substance or worth, and these are the main part of the game!\n\nIntersperced between these prolonged sections of bland mediocrity are the occasional part that requires actual skill, like playing Frogger or Space Invaders. That's right, this game is so insubstantial it relies on games that are the best part of two or three decades old. These mini-games also come in the form of Duck Hunt, Quake, Virtual Boy 3D Tennis and more that are either rip-off other (Better) games or just made without any thought put into them. As they try to do a variety of old games, it fails to do any of them well and they all end up being the same (If not lesser) than whatever they were replicating, and as such there's no personality in these mini-games. Quake is thinly disguised as Wedding Qake, which is a watered down version with uninspired designs for everything inside the mini-game. Near the end, there are several of these re-used mini-games in a row which you're supposed to lose for the story to go on, with no prior knowledge that you failing was vital to what little plot there is, and as most of these mini-games control poorly, you end up putting a fair amount of effort into something you inevitably lose, which is always annoying.\n\nThis is generally the part where, if you haven't already, you talk about the story and memorable parts, however in this case I'll mention the lack of each. The plot is pushed along by your pre-mission briefings, and the occasional scripted sequence. None of those flashy scripted sequences shown in the trailers mind you, those never really happen. Instead you have these very slow and unexciting sections in which you go from point A to point B, maybe knocking down a few people if you go out of your way for it. There is no sense of pacing whatsoever, and anything interesting it has to offer to shows off as soon as it can shoe-horn in a bad punchline.\n\nIn addition to that, the minimal amount of interaction required is plagued by some rather bizarre technical issues. Mouse smoothing and acceleration change from time to time with no reason or indication that it's happened. The artstyle itself can be off-putting from time to time, so having your mouse go completely nuts combined may lead to motion sickness, especially in the penultimate level in where you're inside some sort of technical difficulties area, complete with bluescreens and enough whizzy things to make your head spin. That and the layout of the level may lead to headaches, without factoring in problems with mouse acceleration or smoothing. Using a gamepad works well, thankfully, and I reccomend that if you can play through Jazzpunk with a controller that you do. There's no real challenge here, so anyone can use a controller with ease in Jazzpunk.\n\nJazzpunk reminds me of Borderlands in a way. The admittedly nifty artstyle and its brand of humour (If you can call it that) are just a cover for an insubstantial game with horrible gameplay and a lack of a plot. Unlike Borderlands however, Jazzpunk doesn't have moments of catharsis or entertaining distractions from the main quest. Despite all of that, Jazzpunk is well intentioned and with a little more thought put into the humour and gameplay, it may even stand up as a game, not just a sightseeing tour.\n\nFor more reviews check out http://steamcommunity.com/groups/truereview","January 4, 2015","false","3.6"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","33","56","0","4"

In the world of Jazzpunk, you play an agent named Polyblank. You explore the 3D world from a first-person perspective, doing everything except the main objective first so that you don't just see a only a very tiny fraction of what's actually in the game. It may be a bit thin to some players, but it still is the kind of thing only a videogame can do, and we need more stuff like this or evolved from it. Here a line something like "generic joke" can work because the whole thing is not generic. Yes, you'll get tired of such stuff if you talk to every NPC like ya should and sometimes it has referential "humor."\n\nWell, sadly, I do feel to mention that it's probably a four hour game for people. The FOV is unchangable and character movement continues after you release movement. Also consider the price and buy when you won't feel disappointed. Regarding achievements, they are all just for poking about the Jazzpunk world well, so I suggest ignoring them due to light spoilers on your first playthrough and looking forward to them for the second.\n\nJazzpunk's a type we need more of.

It's a First Person Puzzle/Adventure game that brings a breath of fresh air to the genre. it has multiple TV Shows, Movies and various Video Games refrences like Frogger, Solitaire and even Quake.the game never takes itself seriously, and that what makes it so fun and intriguing.\n\nJazzpunk's graphics are also one of my favorite features of the game. The graphics are like 3D-2D kind of hybrid that looks really good and surreal and really adds up to the whole Steampunk thing this game has, kinda like "Thirty Flights of Loving" or "Paint The Town Red".\n\nbut the  REALLY  big con is it's length. the games is about 4 hours long and really leaves you a bit disappointed when you finish it. i really hope that the developrs will make a sequel for this great game (and this time make it a bit longer).\ni give it a 9/10.","November 7, 2015","true","6.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rejectedcaboose/recommended/250260/","rejectedcaboose","RejectedCaboose","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rejectedcaboose/","351 products in account","With a $15 price tag, Jazzpunk is NOT impressive at all. Even with the fact that I purchased the game 75% off, the game still fails to deliver what I expected. Maybe it is the fact that I watched a brief video of someone playing it. If you are purchasing this game because your favorite youtuber played it  DON'T DO IT . There's no point; you are just redoing those events in the video but in your game. Nothing is different other than the fact that you are just playing it by yourself.\n\nBut if you're not a doofus like me and you don't watch let's plays or whatever, I could still list off many reasons why to avoid this game, no matter if it's on sale or not. Yes the game has a unique and interesting setting, but they do not utilize it. The map feels very scripted and limited to the point where you know where there's going to be an invisible wall. The maps are based off level by level so you can't really go back or explore. It's just levels. There's few interactivity but everything else you wish you could do, you probably can't. The puzzles are easy and straight to the point. Sometimes I would get stuck because I over-thought one. The jokes are not that funny, and more punny. They are the jokes that make you cringe and sigh at. The comedy of this game may appeal to some, but I did not crack a chuckle. It may appeal to a young child or an autistic grown man-child. A few more things to throw in were that my framerates were always plunging down on some parts. There are some bugs on each level where you could see font from a distance. The sound design (other than the goofy voice acting) is crap, putting annoying ambience noises on loop. The game in general just felt very  linear, scripted, and limited.\n\nIf I had to compliment one thing, it would be the artwork and the graphics. I like the characters and I think they are silly looking. The environment is basic and colorful. But that's about it.\n\nOverall this very short $15 game does not live up to my expectations, and in fact, the game should be cheaper. If you are interested in this game but you don't want to buy it- just watch a video of someone playing and their commentary (doesn't matter who you watch) would be funnier than the game itself.","February 23, 2015","false","1.2"," 15 of 24 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","15","24","0","0"

At its heart, Jazzpunk is a game about walking around and having surreal things happen to, around, and because of you. Some of these things are more interactive than others. It's hard to really tell you what these things are without spoiling loads of jokes, which are kind of the main reason to play the game.\n\nSuffice to say, the humor is great. From computer puns and silly mini-games, to witty nonsense and a vacation resort filled with Hunter S. Thompsons, there's plenty to go 'round.\n\nJazzpunk isn't overly long. I clocked in at just under 4 1/2 hours, and that was by doing everything.\n\nIt gets good marks in the visual departments. The game is stylized in a strange way, and it wears it well. The music is... well, it fits. Take that as you will. I mean, it's good. I just don't really know how to describe it. It sounds like the sort of music that would go well with a weird Cold War spy surreal stylized computer-themed comedy game thing. Okay?\n\nOkay.\n\nI enjoyed it. The best part about odd comedy is that it can be quite good at consistently catching you off-guard, and Jazzpunk certainly was just that. I laughed aloud many times throughout my adventure.

Like the title of the game suggest, this game takes in a retro-futuristic setting that is reminiscent of the 1940's or 50's era. This is an adventure indie game by Adult Swim where you play the role of a spy and given missions to undertake through each level. Jazzpunk is fun and clever with it's dry humor and pop culture references. There are fun little mini-games throughout the story to encourage the player to exploring each passing level. The graphics are nice and fits the style and tone of the game. This game is fun, clever and just plain bizarre at times but I cannot recommend this game at full price. The game is just too short to justify the price tag. Total game play if you just stick to the story is maybe 2 1/2 hours at most. After you are done with the game's story, there is not much to keep the player from coming back for a second play through. It is a great game, but the no replay value and short story hurts this game. This should be a $10 game at most.  Get this game when it's on sale. It's a 7/10 for me.","August 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you dislike any kind of surrealism or completely over-the-top and often quite random humor this game is not for you, but I'm pretty sure you have gathered that from just watching the trailer and looking at the screenshots.\n\nNow, for those still with me: this game is pretty short. I'm talking below 5 hours short for 100% completion.\nI personally consider this game a must-play though, simply because it's such a unique and hilarious experience. However, I gotta be honest and say you shouldn't get this at its full price. Either get it in a bundle like I did (if that ever happens again) or buy it at a discount of at least 60% off.\n\nJazzpunk features some light puzzling, platforming, a little "combat" and some sandbox-ish messing around with everything you can find in the environment. It has a nice comic-like art style and brims with pop-cultural references (James Bond, Star Wars, Fear & Loathing In Las Vegas and so many more). Comedy is hard to pull off in video games, but Jazzpunk is a prime example for slapstick done right.","December 30, 2014","true","4.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","4","4","2","1"

There almost isn't a point in reviewing this title with all the hype it's received lately, so I'll be briefer than my normal reviews here.  Jazzpunk has a very unique asthetic and an almost anarchic sense of humour.  It's these that the game hinges upon, so if either falls flat for you watching the gameplay trailers or the reviews, then I wouldn't pick up this game, as the actual gameplay while lightly enjoyable is about as shallow as a tea tray.  For me personally, it was a short but fun ride that had me genuinely laughing at a few points.  While a few of the jokes fell flat for me, some of them were quite funny.  The production values are certainly high and the voice acting - including a spot by Jim Sterling - were actually quite well done, which certainly helps with some of the jokes.  So if the humour appeals, then you'll definetely find an enjoyable purchase in the game and I would highly recommend it.","February 14, 2014","true","4.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/turkeydipking/recommended/250260/","turkeydipking","Turkeydipking","http://steamcommunity.com/id/turkeydipking/","415 products in account","Jazzpunk understands video game humor.\n\nFrom the get-go the player is faced with a stylistic and slick animation introing the game - it's simple 2D colourful style is reminiscent of several movie openings, Catch Me If You Can being a prime example. And from that very moment the game feels abstract and different.\nThere is much to say about Jazzpunk, but not much can be said without spoiling the game itself, as the beauty and charm relies heavily on situational humor, references, and player-induced gags.\nTo put it simply you are an agent tasked with fulfilling tasks for your "secret" agency during an alternative cold war era. Thus, you will be tasked with infiltrating a Russian Consolate to steal data, killing a target in a Japanese setting, and making a journey around the world into a holiday resort to steal vital information. Each of these cliched settings and quests is accompanied by a varied amount of jokes, gags, situational humour and dark comedy. The best part about them? Very few are shoved down the players throat. If you don't explore the environment, you won't get the jokes. If you don't interact with items/NPCs/backgrounds you will never know whether they have something funny to say or whether they will cause a chain reaction of absurd humour.\n\nAnd absurd is an area very known to Jazzpunk - The characters exist in a reality where they semi-know they are inside a video game and are able to express insightful and hilarious commentary accompanying many of the jokes and gags. As you approach an agent-looking-man in a dark alley, the moment he begins talking to you the text "SIDE QUEST" appears underneath him on the pavement, mocking both the player and the game industry, and yet somehow managing to put a smile on your face. Text is one of the vital strengths of Jazzpunk, and one of the stylistic decisions I enjoyed the most.\nThe text is superimposed upon the 3D world as part of the charm. Almost every line of dialogue or activity is accompanied by a few small lines of white, bold, caps-lock text which further mock or create humor as appropriate to the situation.\n\nJazzpunk is also full of mini-games, each of them their own gig, their own sketch, their own gag. The mini-games make little sense and don't actually add anything to the games story or plot development, but they are hard to hate. (As an example if you explore enough you'll get to play "Wedding Qake" A wedding cake version of quake with AI pretending to be real players, and chatting to each other with phrases such as "lol ur pretty gud at this game, a/s/l?") This can be entirely missed and the player is never told that such a minigame exists, which makes exploration in this game all the more and valuable.\n\nSince a lot of exploration games have been released recently - Dear Esther, The Stanley Parable and Gone Home just to name a few, Jazzpunk plays on a similar idea that The Stanley Parable utilized, except it does it better. Rewarding the player for his/her exploration isn't done with dialogue, with achievements, with new tasks or with arbitrary map unlocks or anything of the like - exploring Jazzpunk feels like exploring a Monty Python sketch, a basin of comedy waiting to splash you the moment you dip your hand in it.\n\nThere isn't a lot to critique about this game, maybe aside from it's length - I was able to 100% complete Jazzpunk in under 3 hours. Whether I saw all the gigs and jokes I won't know, and that's the wonderful thing about it too. It's likely that upon revisiting the game you will discover a lot of comedy you missed the first time around.\n\nOverall it's hard not to recommend Jazzpunk as an interactive comedy experience. As a game it's a pretty simplistic first-person point-and-click with mini-games added for good measure, under the hood of a game though is a greater experience, one that brings the player into a bizzare world of comedy, pop-references, abstract voice acting and a ridiculous story, all tied together by playing on the basic human need of exploration and wanting to smile and laugh.\nSince laughing is healthy, it's likely that Jazzpunk will extend your life by like 0.02 years, so you should probably get it for that.","February 19, 2014","true","2.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The same can be said of the punchy eclectic soundtrack which is just as bizarre and quirky.\n\nThe completely random and bizarre mini-games are a highlight in terms of what jazzpunk can deliver in the hilarity department.\n\nIt's less a traditional gaming experience, and more a first person adventure game, and an experience akin to a digital acid trip.\n\nRecommended to anyone keen to have a humour packed pseudo-psychedelic experience, thouroughly enjoyable albeit short. worth the price of admission.","November 21, 2014","true","1.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Jazzpunk has done this to me.\n\nIt's a short game (only took me about 2 and a half hours to play through), but there is more creativity, humor, and pure absurdity packed into this brief experience than most much longer games can conjure in their entire playthroughs. In fact, I'm not even sure how to describe this game, and I get the feeling that trying to do so will only sell it short. I can say, though, that this is probably the first game that has ever manged to pull me out of my zone of familiarity so far, yet was still able to remain engaging beginning to end, consistently make me laugh, regularly make me question if I just saw what I thought I saw, and cause me to think about the game and its world when I was away from my PC.\n\nFor the first time in quite some time, I was genuinely disappointed to see the ending credits of a video game. I wanted to exist in the world of Jazzpunk for a much longer period of time. There are still so many mysteries to unravel, so many characters to meet, and so many places to visit. The game's length is its only weakness. Otherwise, this was one of the most purely enjoyable and memorable video games I've played in quite some time.

The scenery is so atmospheric, it feels alive thanks to music, at least 90% of the stuff in it is interactive and every single one of them contains some kind of gag. Every single NPC you will come across will have something to say.

Shooter isn't the right word here I guess, because you won't be shooting anyone here, and when you do (maybe 2-3x) it's just for the fun of it.\n\nThis game parodies a lot of games and movies from the 80's and 90's and does it in style. I must admit that I wasn't impressed by the graphics of the game when I first saw the screenshots, but after having played it it looks really sharp and clean. The NPC's are still roughly modeled, however, and I think they could've done a better job here, but that's debatable.\n\nThere are so many little details, scenes and easter eggs to be found that you can't help but smile if you understand a reference. I don't think a lot of people will be laughing out loud, it's just all too random.\n\nThere are, technically, 4 levels to complete (if you count the mini levels it's a bit higher, of course) and each of them can be completed in around 30 minutes. So it isn't a long game. In fact, I think you can finish it within an hour if you just rush through it, but trust me, it's worth it to touch/activate/etc. as much as you can, and just play around with stuff.\nFor a game this random I was surprised to actually find a semi decent story here. It won't blow anyone away, but considering the context of the game it's kinda fun.\n\nIf you like weird and random games play Jazzpunk. It's also good if you want to relax. You can take your time doing things, and you're not being pushed forward every 2 minutes. Yes,... yes, I think I like Jazzpunk.\n\n[Rating: 76/100]","February 11, 2014","true","4.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/recommended/250260/","dinoracha","Dinoracha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dinoracha/","426 products in account","A friend of mine has labelled Jazzpunk as an 'interactive joke machine', which I feel sums the game in its entirety. Unlike titles like Proteus for example, which are more compelled to give you an experience and story rather than any kind of solid campaign (and also is debated on whether or not it's an actual game), Jazzpunk brings you a nicely sized campaign that is more interested in entertaining you through cheeky puns, strange encounters and comedic situations than anything else... But surely you could browse image sites instead of paying $14.99 for a laugh, right?\n\nI won't be using words like 'acid', 'drugs' or 'trip', regardless of the numerous bewildering sights and interactions you'll have during your missions in Jazzpunk, even if I question the developers state of mental clarity when they came up with most of the game's content. It all starts off innocently enough; you playing as a secret agent who must go to Soviet Russia and steal precious intel, then escape. If you have even a fractional tiny chance of being distracted however, a mission that would take less than ten minutes to complete through its linear track will soon become an hour, thanks to the game being stuffed with NPC's, mini-games, references and other oddities that will either confuse you or make you laugh out loud, or a delightful mixture of both. While at first I was hesitant of playing a game that was simply a comedy routine and little else, I was very impressed in finding that most to all of the jokes were sharp, witty and never, ever overstayed their welcome. Premise, hook, punchline, done. Never did it feel like a joke had to linger longer than it had to in order to make you chuckle, and even if you don't laugh at some jokes, you can just proceed on to the next odd chatter a NPC had to share with you and move along like nothing ever happened. Jazzpunk has an incredible strength in that aspect, allowing its player to progress at the speed that they wish, able to take in all the gags at their own pace, and despite quite a few jokes refer to computer and technological terms, the clever writing will ensure that nothing ever truly sails over your head.\n\nTo talk about the finer details of all the comedy in Jazzpunk would feel like a major spoiler, and I would be cheating you. Thankfully, it's not a raunchy romp, nor is it a child-friendly adventure. Despite being silly and weird as hell, it does merit a Mature rating from the ESRB due to violent sights and adult themes, but there isn't anything that would cause incredible shock or offense; again, applause for the intelligent writing staff. For me to try and objectively comment on the gameplay is a moot point, as you merely walk around and interact with characters or objects to either uncover jokes, a diversion or even side-quests, which can lead towards the handful of achievements Jazzpunk has. One could argue that this game could have been a Flash game on the internet for free as a point and click adventure, but I would argue that you lose much of the visual appeal when not made into a 3D adventure. I'm no art major and Jazzpunk isn't looking to be put on display in a museum, but the graphics are both subtle and clear enough to not assault your senses and detract you from the experience or make it a struggle to find something else to interact with for the next joke. It's not to say that Jazzpunk is lazy in its graphics, but between the bathroom sign figure population and the nicely detailed though still deranged looking environments, the game strikes a nice balance between wanting to look presentable, but doesn't blow its budget into trying to net awards for being the best looking game ever.\n\nI didn't realize how impressed I was with Jazzpunk's technical and visual aspects until I sat down to write this, and to complain that this is an interactive adventure game would just be silly. I will however gripe that for $15 I would've enjoyed a bit more time in the weird, cyberpunk universe, though this is a risky gambit since artificial game extension may just lead to recycled and stale jokes that seriously miss their mark. With my wandering and desire to unearth all the jokes, my first playthrough of Jazzpunk took me about four hours, and that's considering I possibly might have missed some jokes here and there, which leads into my only major complaint; replay value. Unless you want to go back and get all the achievements, find those last few hidden gags or want to take another spin in the future when you need a chuckle, Jazzpunk's shelf life feels quite limited, especially if you don't share in the referential, computing and word play jokes throughout the game. I'm getting my value out of the game through speedruns, but I suppose Jazzpunk can be appreciated like many indie games that are labelled as 'art'; an occasional playthrough to remind you what made the game, and your purchase, worthwhile.\n\nI digress. A $15 dollar price tag is asking just a bit much, where $10 would've been pretty much the perfect price tag. That said, I have no regrets of spending my time with Jazzpunk, where laughs and dumbfounded stares were plenty. If the trailer to the game garnered no interest from you, then I would wait until a sale heavily drops the price. Just do yourself a favor and avoid having any jokes or discoveries be spoiled for you; even the above three images feels like I'm robbing you of what can be expected in the game, but thankfully, they're nowhere near the weirdness you'll came across later on. Jazzpunk gets a solid recommendation from me, but maybe not at the full $15 price tag.","February 26, 2014","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

In it you play a spy called Polyblank in what is a spoof of 50's and 60's era spy films. The game is so bizarre it's hard to describe it. It really is one of those things you need to experience for yourself.\n\nThe basic formula of the game is each level is an open area you can expore through at will and discover the various strange and funny events and mini-games in each level. There are some fun mini-games in this game (Wedding Quake being my favourite) that are parodies of classic games.\n\nThis is a short game but it is packed with a lot of fun.\n\nThe Good\n- This game was a lot of fun to play. Each level has a lot of random stuff to discover.\n- I enjoyed this games humour. It's a bit off the wall and bizarre which was right up my street.\n- The visual style of this game really stands out and looks great a bit like a weird Hanna-Barbara cartoon.\n\nThe Bad\n- It is pretty short. Even with taking my time and almost fully exploring all the levels my playtime came to just over 3 hours.\n- This games humour might not appeal to everyone.\n\nOverall this was a fun but regrettably short game which i enjoyed a lot more than i expected. 7.5/10","July 6, 2014","true","3.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's an odd mixture of explorative scenarios (similar to Hitman) with a ton of distractions and mini games littered around you with no actual insentive to complete aside from some superb humor.\n\nThe only way to truely understand is to play it for yourself.

Throw in postmodern and referential humor with a penchant for cyberpunk tropes and gadgetry, and you’ve got Jazzpunk.\n\nGames like Jazzpunk and The Stanley Parable excel at telling a story through exploration and discovery, and provide a lot of laughs in their initial playthroughs. The downside to this is that once all of the jokes are found, there lacks personal replay value; although, I can see the appeal in replaying the game with company over so to share some laughs or revisiting the game in the future.\n\nIf you have no qualms playing through an exceptionally funny three hour game for $15, then Jazzpunk might be for you. Personally, I really enjoyed my time with the game, albeit the inclusion of so many minigames kind of put it – at least in my eyes – on the borderline between a traditional title with extensive gameplay, and an interactive narrative game. At the end, I wanted more from Jazzpunk; it felt shorter than it should be and I wanted to see more from the wacky world it takes place in.","February 12, 2014","true","4.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A child of the 90s will feel right at home with all of the references, but anyone with a sense of humor can appreciate the entire game. Not only is the game very funny, but it's also very psychadelic. I feel like certain parts of this game are more drug-induced than the LSD Simulator that was released years ago on the PS1...

HELL YES.\nI took my time, tried various things and I finished the game in barely 2 hours. To a rather unsatisfying ending.\n\nDon't get me wrong; Jazzpunk is a good game. If you know about computers, video games, the 80s and 90s pop culture and current geek pop culture, there's plenty of laughs to be had. Maybe times I caught myself going "AW YEAH" while chuckling. Even a few "I can't believe they did that.".\nBut, in the end, the game is incredibly underwhelming.\n\nUnder the guise of a 70s-era spy show set in a computer, you find yourself trying to get a russian data tape, then find an old enemy, save yourself and save someone else. And that's it.\nLots of slapstick comedy, but... is it worth 15$? No.\n10$ would have been a steep yet fair price, in my opinion. For two hours of gameplay, if would be on par with a movie admission ticket.\nBut I complain about movies charging more than 10$ for a 1.5 hours running time feature-length movie, I would be remiss in pointing out the same flaws with a video game.\n\nIf you want to support an indie developper with a great sense of humour, and maybe Jim Sterling at the same time, then go right ahead.\nHowever, if you are looking for anything that will "go the distance", so to speak, then don't. And that's with the gimmick of "click on everything at least once" of exploration games, such as this one.\n\nTL;DR:\nHilarious if you're a 25-or-plus years old geek, finished awfully and disappointingly fast.","February 15, 2014","false","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The controls are super simple, the gameplay is immense, the jokes are nonstop. If you enjoy humor games then you'll want to pick this one up.\nOf course there are some complaints, so lets go ahead and get those out of our way. Super short, yeah it is. you can speed run it in about 45 mins, and can get all achievements in one run through if you take your time and explore resulting in about 3-4 hours of gameplay. I know right. Secondly, the mouse, you will need to adjust your settings when you first start, put them on the lowest setting you can, otherwise you'll spin in circles. Lastly, some people including myself have reported feeling ill while playing this. Turning off the mouse smoothing option will help, however the game also has a 3D element to it, so that might be whats making people get motion sickness. (but if you have a pair of 3d glasses or can make a pair, it makes the game so much more...insane. Yeah thats a good way to put it.\nIf your young I'll admit you might not get some of the jokes. A lot of the comments and references are from old 70's and 80's films, cartoons and TV shows. Hunter S. Thompson has a nice role in the game, with some great quotes I might add, so that should give you some kind of indication what level of humor we are talking about here. (If you don't know who Hunter S. is, please go watch 2 movies right now, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, and Where the Buffalo Roam. His books and articles from Rolling Stone are better but I can't expect anyone to read a book anymore.)\nSo yeah I recommend this game, its funny, it looks great, the soundtrack is great, controls are easy and self explanitory.

Which really shouldn't be taken seriously, as the game is all about doing funny missions, activities and coming across references. What attracted me is the art style of the world and the people, which all can be seen in first person.  I really enjoyed the humour in this game and it even made me laugh out loud several times. Even after a while playing the humour doesn't get predictable. The humour is mostly: cartoonish, absurd and goofy. Afterall I am happy that I have played Jazzpunk because there are not many games with an funny experience. The only two complaints I have is that after a while I didn't want to talk to random people in the game because they weren't that funny. And the other one is that the game only takes around 3 hours, Which may be for many people too few hours for the asking price. So those people can better wait for a sale.\n\n\nIn short:\nA game where you walk around and encounter many funny activities, references, people and mini-games.","August 31, 2014","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Relaxing and exhilarating at the same time, I’ve enjoyed every minute of this game. A true gem, bursting with experimentation, joy and creativity. Necrophone Games are testament to the old adage, “Build it and they will come” and like Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams, Necrophone listened to the voices in their heads and built a game unlike anything we’ve seen before, or will ever see again, and the people rejoiced.

It contains so many references to so many things, the amount of times I found myself laughing out loudly is too many to count. Some of the jokes are really obvious and might make you cuckle a bit at most, however many catch you off guard so badly you might even have to pause the game for a few minutes so you can try and contain yourself again.\nYes, the game is slightly overpriced for the short playtime and the fact that you cannot replay the game because once you've seen and heard the jokes and references you won't need to laugh at them again, but playing this game is an experience. I'm not sure what kind of experience, but it's a good one.\nIf you want a good 3 to 4 hour laugh and have a little money to spare, then buy this game now.

It's the kind of game the Zucker Brothers (Airplane, The Naked Gun) would make if they were around and playing games during the Nintendo 64 era. The humor is mostly really really silly, but there's so many gags thrown in there that eventually one will pop up that really makes you laugh. The whole game feels more like a fun toy than a game with a well defined structure. Most of the areas have lots and lots of optional things to play with or people to get dialogue from. There's almost nothing else out there like Jazzpunk, and I wish I could play it all over again without knowing the gags.

Well, this game was funny-ish (how many electronic/software/computer puns can you fit into one scene?). Very charming, retro-chic style and music (the music is the best part). Makes me wish I was a high-roller sales exec in the 50s, when flying and traveling were still cool.\n\nBut other than the massive nostalgia blast, kind of not fun as a GAME. Lots of near-chuckle moments, almost no laughing. A single digit number of gross-out/creep-out moments. Jazzpunk really wants to be Maniac Mansion or Day or the Tentacle, or some other adventure game that really knows how to bring the funny, but those games it ain't. I got this as part of a bundle from another distributor that shall not be named. Glad I did, otherwise I'd have been annoyed at how short the game was. (A lot of my recorded game time was just pausing the game to go do something else). If you watch a playthrough, it's as fun as doing it yourself. So don't buy this game. Because you have better things to do. Like, anything.\n\nI'm telling you, if you buy this game and finish it after reading this review, you'll be like, "Man, I wish I had listened to that reviewer guy, he was right." Last chance?

I would have recommended this if it was cheaper, but for 12€ you get 2-3 hours (this including most of the side activities and achivements) of comedy that ranges from actually funny to "that was supposed to be funny?", which I realise is hard to avoid with a game that is completely built on comedy, but while a game like The Stanley Parable managed to be funny time after time, the jokes here aren't very fun on replay if at all. The gameplay is also a bit on the iffy side, which for a "walk and interact with stuff" kind of game is hard to defend, with the walking in the game feeling floaty and sluggish, and there just isn't enough varriation in fun things to happen when clicking around. The sound design is also rather bad with music that is downright depressing and droning, and overdone robot effects on voices which sometimes makes it hard to actually understand what is being said.\n\nIf you see this on a really cheap sale and want to see a game build itself entierly on crazy random comedy, then sure, do pick it up, but it's simply not worth more than 5€ in my opinion when there isn't a lot of content to be had, with only 3 actual big levels.","February 11, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Each mission has one central objective, but the player is free to explore the game world at their own pace, which is populated with a large number of interactive NPCs, each with their own action or gag. The player takes the role of Polyblank, a silent protagonist. The game begins when Polyblank is mailed to the espionage agency in a human-shaped suitcase. He is then given several missions by the head of the organization, all of which begin by ingesting a dose of prescription medicine. The missions assigned to Polyblank are almost always bizarre and nonsensical, relying heavily on free association and references to older movies and video games. Tasks include degaussing and smuggling pigeons, assassinating cowboys, cross-dressing, killing a pig with a ukulele, and photocopying Polyblank's bottom to fool a security scanner. The game was originally created as a prototype in 2007, running on a standalone engine. The project was then transferred to Torque3D before being transferred to the Unity game engine, on which the final build was created.","April 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Whether or not it’s worth it is going to wildly differ from person to person.  So I’ll end with a vague recommendation; give Jazzpunk a go if you’re in the mood to nerd it up for an evening, but don’t blame me if you expect a game that asks you to photocopy your ♥♥♥♥ to act as an I.D. picture to be high humour.\n\nFull Review -- http://www.honestgamers.com/12199/pc/jazzpunk/review.html","February 27, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It contains so many references to so many things, the amount of times I found myself laughing out loudly is too many to count. Some of the jokes are really obvious and might make you cuckle a bit at most, however many catch you off guard so badly you might even have to pause the game for a few minutes so you can try and contain yourself again.\nYes, the game is slightly overpriced for the short playtime and the fact that you cannot replay the game because once you've seen and heard the jokes and references you won't need to laugh at them again, but playing this game is an experience. I'm not sure what kind of experience, but it's a good one.\nIf you want a good 3 to 4 hour laugh and have a little money to spare, then buy this game now. If you're not convinced by what you've seen of the game then maybe wait until it's on sale. But if it is on sale for -50% or more then buy it, definitely!","February 11, 2014","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A wholly unique and incredibly fun game. It is, hands down, one of the best games I've played in ages. Considering how simple of a game it is that may seem like an exaggeration, but that's the truth.\n\nThe entirety of the gameplay is essentially walking around and clicking on just about anything you can see. However, inside the simple gameplay is a wealth of humor and absurdism so abundant that it bursts through the simplicity to smack you in the face, leaving you asking for more. This is a really short game, I mean extremely so, and I would have loved for it to be longer. But really, there's so much packed into what little length there is that I know if I play through it again I'll find more goodies, side quests, and easter eggs that I didn't see the first few times around.\n\nI wholeheartedly recommend this game. I got this way below the asking price in a bundle, but it is more than worth the full fifteen dollars. If you can get it cheaper, then great, but consider buying it full price if you can't because it's a great game that everyone should try.","March 24, 2015","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/-dmn-/recommended/250260/","-dmn-","used to be cool","http://steamcommunity.com/id/-dmn-/","40 products in account","Jazzpunk is a single-player, first-person adventure game, focusing on exploration and comedy over puzzle-solving. Each mission has one central objective, but the player is free to explore the game world at their own pace, which is populated with a large number of interactive NPCs, each with their own action or gag. The player takes the role of Polyblank, a silent protagonist. The game begins when Polyblank is mailed to the espionage agency in a human-shaped suitcase. He is then given several missions by the head of the organization, all of which begin by ingesting a dose of prescription medicine. The missions assigned to Polyblank are almost always bizarre and nonsensical, relying heavily on free association and references to older movies and video games. Tasks include degaussing and smuggling pigeons, assassinating cowboys, cross-dressing, killing a pig with a ukulele, and photocopying Polyblank's bottom to fool a security scanner. The game was originally created as a prototype in 2007, running on a standalone engine. The project was then transferred to Torque3D before being transferred to the Unity game engine, on which the final build was created.","April 6, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's the kind of game the Zucker Brothers (Airplane, The Naked Gun) would make if they were around and playing games during the Nintendo 64 era. The humor is mostly really really silly, but there's so many gags thrown in there that eventually one will pop up that really makes you laugh. The whole game feels more like a fun toy than a game with a well defined structure. Most of the areas have lots and lots of optional things to play with or people to get dialogue from.

I completely disagree. You can play this game for way more than 2 hours. It's hilarious and there's plenty of hidden treats to find if you really dive into this game completely. There were moments where I was literally laughing out loud. Not many games have managed to do that.\nThe only downsides I experienced was the lack of details in some places. You've basically been told by the game to explore as much as possible but in some cases there's a lack of depth and there's this feeling that they could've put more work into it.

Interactive pun simulator? Burroughs-em-up? It's a distracting and fairly enjoyable little thing, but this is ultimately a once only experience. I wouldn't recommend dropping more than £5 on this if you can avoid it given a loose £/hr enjoyment ratio you can get everywhere else.\n\nI'm all for doing something a bit different within the concept of a 'game'. What Jazzpunk provides is an on-rails 'experience' telling a somewhat surreal story laced with puns and references to hard-boiled detective fiction and gaming staples and offering up a few puzzles to solve on the way.\n\nWhilst never exactly actively bad it does suffer from being overly drawn out in places and the general pacing feels a little disjointed. The puzzles seem to actually get less difficult as the story progresses, perhaps this was a intentional 'thing' but if so the point of it was lost on me.\nIf you've played games long enough to anticipate some of the usual game design language (the items hidden in the bind corner, if the game points you left have a quick look to the right, pull the lever that appears to do nothing etc) then don't bother chasing after the intriguing possibilities in Jazzpunk. There a lot of hidings to nothing to waste your time on for no reward.\n\nI really am trying to be positive about this game, I'm giving it a thumbs up because it's not actiively awful.\nWhat there is is very nicely made, there's nothing technically wrong with it, but ultimately when reaching the end I was just left with a general feeling of "Oh.

Art! These two words are ones almost never in the same sentence together, which is why I separated them with exclamation points. Separated or not though, Jazzpunk is both of these things.\nBut to get to the point, (before I start talking about the weather or something, which i'm sure is nice where you live (if not, then I'm sure it's not nice (that is to say, I'm sure the weather is well weathered where you live (that really isn't what I was trying to say, but the 'weather is well weathered' pun is demonstrating the type of joke that can be found within Jazzpunk (You're welcome!))))) the real brilliance of Jazzpunk is how it frequently allows the player to transcend the main narrative in favour of allowing pointless exploration. The game itself is really more about the funny* hidden jokes than the silly storyline. So I only recommend this game if you have the patience to examine every little thing you come across. Or if you are an achievement hound.

Jazzpunk is an avant-garde comedy adventure inspired by spoof films and old slapstick cartoons. In this cyberpunk style world with an alternate reality Cold War theme, you are some type of spy or investigative agent. You are sent on missions finding cases of corporate espionage and “CyberCrime” in an open world.\n\nJazzpunk will leave you scratching your head as much as it will be making you laugh. Each level has a main mission you must accomplish, but that is just the surface of what the game is all about. Expecting the unexpected will do you no good as you will still be absolutely bewildered at what lies behind every corner. Find a pizza box next to an old bum in the street corner? Open it and find that it brings you to another pizza world where you must kill pizza zombies with your oversized pizza pan and cutter. Surprises like that are waiting for you behind nearly every intractable object.\n\nA large amount of content in the game is not mandatory for completion, but that is what makes it so great.  You feel the impulse to cover every inch of each area to ensure that everything is experienced, because it is definitely worth exploring. Maybe you will steal the entry ticket to the hotel rooms, and in one you will find a bride and groom with their wedding cake that transports you into a wedding edition of Quake, or possibly have sex with a robot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The possibilities and expectations are endless and worth every moment.\n\nOne thing I quickly realized is that there is no sense of challenge throughout the entire game. Essentially there is no way to fail or do something wrong. While this insures that you will never have to do the same thing twice or the hear same joke multiple times, it also removed some depth to certain scenes. Comedy is the game’s forte, which is great in its own sense but ends up revoking any type of challenge the game could possibly offer. If that is good or bad depends on the player, but it is definitely something worth noting.\n\nEven though I took my time trying to explore as much as possible, I still beat the game within 3 hours. That was slightly disappointing seeing how it is a 15 dollar title. Playing the game through multiple times is advised, because there will definitely be things that you missed. I would have liked to see a few more levels packed in there, though. I actually had an interest in the story and where it was going, but in retrospect is was a very short one. The game had some minor technical issues as well, such as crashing when trying to mess with the video settings in game. It wasn’t dual monitor friendly, either. I ended up having to use a control to properly play the game, which is still fine because it is perfectly playable with the standard Xbox controller, but let that be a warning to dual monitor users out there that you may have a few issues.\n\nJazzpunk is an excellent game with a grand sense of humor and a unique style of play.

It’s funny, fun, entertaining and just a fantastic overall game. It has almost no flaws aside from being a three-hour experience, but that’s okay since the game only costs $15. I love everything about Jazzpunk and I feel that it’s probably one of the contenders for game of the year or at least indie game of the year. There’s simply nothing like it currently, and I’m glad. It’s a very unique experience that you truly will not find anywhere else.","February 7, 2014","true","5.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

And why did it stop being funny after two hours you might ask? Because the game was unnecessarily short. I bought the game earlier today (Date the review was posted) and beat it in the first sitting. I must give some credit to the many, MANY pop-culture references, they were very entertaining. Before I purchased the game I anticipated many hours of entertainment, and my hopes were partially fulfilled.\nIn my honest opinion, the game was DEFINITELY not worth the $5.        (I'm not very rich of a person either)\nCons:\n1.Too short 2.Little Replay Value\nPros:\n1.Very funny 2.Hilarious storyline","August 12, 2014","false","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/granderojo/recommended/250260/","granderojo","granderojo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/granderojo/","482 products in account","Jazzpunk is a comedy in the burgeoning sub genre of first person games like Gone Home or Thirty Flights of Loving that seek to tell a linear story in a non-linear experience by shepherding the protagonist with incentives. This review is the hardest review I've ever attempted to write. Being a comedy, and a video game, many of the jokes are deadpan and are uniquely structured to the levels of the game. Because of that there were levels that hit the mark, such as Wedding Quake were hilarious. Often times though there were jokes in levels that matched that were nearly identical to each other in structure, cadence and delivery right after each other that were not only not funny but actively served to make subsequent new jokes in that level less funny.\n\nThis fault of the game seems to be a result of the non-linear structure. Due to it being a non-linear game there are many chances to miss things. Due to this they would reuse minigames and even types of jokes. That said reused jokes can be funny. There are multiple instances where you are sent through a zombie pizza hut minigame trifle, and each time it gave me goosebumps and it would cause uncontrollable laughter. Most of the jokes are not given as much car as the pizza hut gag or Wedding Quake and are mere stand-up routines. There are instances when multiple non-player characters in levels will give similar routines but not quite the same, and these jokes fall flat.\n\nJazzpunk in many ways is a stark realization that game developers growing up playing Nintendo 64 games are now making games of their own. It’s a weird artifact from an era that went in a different direction, when minigames dominated and there were a torrent of incentives deployed at the player character to get them to complete a non-linear environment in a linear way. In the end, what this boils down to is a unique refreshing experience that's comedy doesn't hack it the whole way through.","February 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

If there is such a thing as a God, it is Jazzpunk.\n\nJazzpunk is a very much experimental game, infusing just about everything under the sun with puns. Alot of puns. Jazzpunk also incorporates just about any game you can think of into one neat little package. Pizza version of Nazi Zombies. Here. Quake game based around weddings. Here.\n\nThe story line, while short, is funny and compelling at the same time. The story focuses on espionage, set in a bright world that enfuses new technology with a background of bright, and colourful Art Deco motifs. There is a ton of exploring to do, easter eggs to find, and whole new games to play! If you follow the main story path, you're looking at 2, maybe 3 hours of gameplay. But combined with all the secrets, achivements and down right silly side-quests, you could easily extend your playtime to 4-5 hours or even more!\n\nI expected a more Thirty Flights of Loving feel to Jazzpunk, but I was mistaken. Jazzpunk (it's just such a fun word to say) is it's own game, heck, it's own genre. It's much more "in your face" than Thirty Flights of Loving, but that isn't always a bad thing. Jazzpunk is just a silly, good time, but doesn't take it too far but actually making all these silly things funny. Granted, you'll need an acute sense of humor to enjoy this game. But I sure enjoyed the hell out of it, and I hope too again soon.\n\n+ The jokes are actually funny. No Duke Nukem Forver nonsense.\n+ The music, art, character and charm of the game are all fantastic.\n+ Incorporates lots of secrets, mini-games, this game has it all. Seriously.\n\n- Story is short\n- The ending is a bit abrupt/cheap\n- The very fact that it does end.\n\n9.5/10.","February 7, 2014","true","10.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

You never know what you're going to come up against next, but you're guaranteed to laugh. Of course you could probably run straight through the game, do the tasks and finish it, but then you'd miss everything else going on. It's a game where you feel rewarded by looking at every little detail because so much of it has extra things to offer. It's not all in your face either, constantly forcing you to be in a typical funny situation. In fact a lot of the comedy in the game is quite subtle and you have to steer from the path in order to find it, but it makes you appreciate it as you play through. The attention to comedic detail is quite marvelous.\n\nThe gameplay is nice and simple. You walk around, interact with objects in often fun and ingenious ways to complete puzzles and make your way through the story.

Its brand of humour is hyper-specific, trading on James Bond, conspiracy theories, William Gibson and a dash of Blendo Games' work. If that type of humour appeals to you then stop reading, buy Jazzpunk, play Jazzpunk.\nJazzpunk may be the funniest game I've ever played. Humour is brutally difficult in games because the player is in control of the timing. Jazzpunk nails it, almost effortlessly. It's a game that rewards you poking at everything, and everything you poke is guaranteed to have a joke attached. The concentration of lunacy is consistently dense. The number of jokes per square metre in this game is ridiculous. There's so much to find and so much to discover. A few jokes fall flat but the majority of them work and work well.\nJazzpunk is essentially an adventure game. Often you'll be asked to collect certain items to combine with other items to progress. It sounds dull but virtually every puzzle is a clever joke or a stupid premise. Jazzpunk's objectives embrace the non-sequiter and the punchline and weave them into everything you do.\nRemember bubsy3d.com? Recall the end scene? Remember the Applebees? Jazzpunk's puzzles and easter eggs rival that moment in their sheer audacity every two minutes.\nIt took some incredibly intelligent people to make a game that's so smart about being dumb.

Certainly one of the most humorous games I’ve played in my life, that’s for sure. There’s just so many things right about Jazzpunk.\n\nJazzpunk is a first-person comedy-adventure game set during the cold war, in an alternate reality. The game places large emphasis on open-world exploration, which can be seen immediately in the first level. I spent the majority of my time in the game exploring, rather than actually playing through the main story, although I did manage to beat the entire game in about two hours. The game’s length being my major complaint. For such a great game, I’d like more than just two hours.\n\nUnique. If I had to use one word to describe Jazzpunk, that’d be it. The game is full of references, side quests, and plenty of areas to explore in the various chapters. I even helped clean a guy’s massive ear out when he was unable to hear. Just one of the silly things that can be accomplished within the several chapters. Oh, and the dialogue. Fantastic. Simply fantastic. A lot of the characters in-game spoke like robots and it seemed like there were new accents everywhere I went.\n\nJazzpunk is heavy on its comedic appeal. There are several instances in the game that serve no purpose other than to make you laugh. I ran into a shop at one point whose door simply said “closed for no reason”. There’s plenty of new things to find when exploring the worlds of each chapter, and, like I said, that’s where I had spent most of my playtime, looking around. It’s overwhelming at times, the amount of stuff that you can find whilst exploring.\n\nThe game uses an interesting art style. I want to say its cel-shaded, but I don’t know if that’d be correct. For the most part, it does look like its cel-shaded, which is always a art style. Nothing to complain about in terms of the game’s graphics.\n\nIf you’re going to pick up Jazzpunk, don’t expect much in terms of length if you just play through the game’s story. Instead, spend some time exploring about. You’ll find yourself laughing at the numerous scenes scattered throughout the game.","February 8, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

That being said, I still found it pretty enjoyable due to the general strangeness of the story.

It looked like a seriously unique, undeniably "indie" experience, and I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.\n\nPlayers heaped praise on the game, finding deep meaning inside the painfully short experience.  I was not one of those people, unfortunately.  I found "Thirty Flights..." to be a shallow proof of concept, at best -- something the developer himself seemed to admit from the commentary track.  I walked away from the game bitter, having felt duped by popular opinion.\n\nThat said, I very much liked the IDEA of "Thirty Flights": an interactive book.  A way of telling a unique, linear story, letting the player guide the narrative along at their own pace.  (Adding VR into the mix will take this immersive idea even further, but I'm getting ahead of myself.)\n\nAs it turns out, the game I was hoping "Thirty Flights" would be, is what "Jazzpunk" actually *IS*.\n\nBoth games are very strange, unique, linear short stories, but "Jazzpunk" gives you a bit more freedom to explore, with side-quests and mini-games here and there along the way.\n\nWhat separates the two further, is that "Jazzpunk" is straight up hilarious and wonderfully strange.  More times than I can count, I found myself wide-eyed, staring at the monitor and going "whaaat!" with a huge smile.\n\nAdditionally, there are numerous references, both popular and obscure, to old technology (Captain Crunch's famous 2600 whistle, for example), and the culture around them.  Raymond Scott's unmistakable trademark musical style heavily influences the proceedings (not to mention directly referenced here and there).\n\nWhile I damned "Thirty Flights" for being criminally short for the price, I found "Jazzpunk"'s short length to be JUST long enough without overstaying it's welcome.  A $10 pricetag would probably be more comfortable than $15, but the effort and love that was clearly put into this...well, I wouldn't at all feel ripped off if I'd paid full price.\n\nI'd absolutely love to see this expanded into an ongoing series, with each installment being just as short but sweet.\n\n4/5","February 8, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It fails just as spectacularly.  Behind the extreme weirdness, there is nothing interesting nor compelling just a bland game full of random occurences and random references.  I would liken it to the recent teenage buzzword "random":  It feels like a desperate cry for attention by being different when in reality it's rather predictable and not the least bit interesting.\n\nGameplay consists of walking around and interacting with various objects and completing very short side missions while you accomplish your main objective for each level.  There are only a couple missions and they go by quickly.  The game tries really hard to be funny but there's not much humor to be found when nothing makes any sense, barring a couple lines from side characters.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, the game is a bit odd.  It has very simple graphics and should run on a toaster due to that but for some reason is limited to 60 fps.  Keyboard movement keys are not set by default so you have to do it yourself and the mouse control is very sluggish and stuttery.  The game also stutters occasionally.  All of these things are extremely strange for a game running on the Unity engine but it doesn't get in the way too much.\n\nSo to summarize Jazzpunk is a very weird game held up entirely by weird random references and humor, neither of which work.  How this game has gotten over 90% positive reviews completely baffles me.","November 6, 2014","false","3.9"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","2"

There can be beauty in simplicity, but this isn't that.\n\nIt isn't deep. There's no atmosphere, I'm not even convinced the game has a plot.\n\nAnd, well, it seems like the game really thinks its funny but it just isn't. I can appreciate some cheap humor but that's all the game has. I chuckled at some opening gags but the charm quickly wore thin. There's no effort put into developing jokes, nor do any gags require even the slightest bit of brain activity.

In a few words a horribly optimized, exceedingly gimmicky, and just plain boring game.\n\nI'm not going to concern you with the plot. If you're interested in this game you know enough about the plot to get you started.  It uses the LOL so random ROFL gimmick to get a rise out of you, and then just stares at you when you don't laugh. Seeming to ask you "What about the gun that turns pedestrians into pigeons don't you find funny?" And that's the thing, at first it sounds very funny, but after the tenth similar joke it gets to be really old and very grating. And then it drags it out for four more levels, begging you to laugh while you just sit silently staring at your screen.\n\nHonestly if you really need to play a comedy game, I would recommend the Stanley Parable, or pretty much anything else. The only way that I would pick this game up was if it was free and had played everything in my backlog five times, and even then I would still hesitate.\n\ntl;dr Don't get this game","June 18, 2015","false","3.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

There's no narrative hooks for many of the jokes, they just exist for the sole purpose of delivering a punchline; experience it and move on.

Even looking for them I finished at just shy of three hours, with the ending just kind of happening rather than being built up to. £9.99 for a game that feels like it was a student's spare time project seems rather hefty to me.

Just beware that most the gameplay is in service of jokes... and going and looking for more jokes... oh and there's a frogger inspired mini game.","May 15, 2014","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Luckily I got this on sale, but even then, 2 hours of cringe-inducing attempts at humor really make this a "poopy-at-best" experience.\n\nIt's enough there is practically no content.  Or that the sounds and voice acting are terrible (made worse if you play with headphones).  Or that the only high points are the swing wing and the mini games.\n\nIf you want a few chuckles but mostly want to groan, get this game.\n\nIf you want an actual game with actual funny moments: wait for if No One Lives Forever comes to Steam/GOG.","February 6, 2015","false","2.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Most of the jokes are reliant on you laughing at something just because it's weird or unexpected. Another reviewer described it as going for "OMGSORANDOMLOL" with every joke and interaction. I couldn't agree more. If this is your deal, you'll enjoy it much more than I did. I still appreciated the game's art style, general focus on silliness, and creativity but it quickly felt like I was being told the same joke for the 1 hour it took to finish this $15 game.\n\nOnly buy it on sale if you really like this kind of humor.

I thought that I would actually be busy playing this...but the puzzles are way to easy to figure out, there are no rewards and u cannot fail.

I'd probably be a bit disappointed by its length had I paid full price.  Though it looks like there's still quite a bit of secret things I could spend some time uncovering, based on the large number of achievements I haven't unlocked.

After playing the game to completion I still don't. This is a game that even once it hints things are going to start to make sense, throws a curve ball of absurdity right at your face. The best way to describe this would be taking Bubsy 3D or Frog Fractions and mixing it with Thirty Flights of Loving or Gravity Bone. I enjoyed every minute of it, and I desperately want to jump back in and try to find the things I missed.

Plenty of tried and true games for me to buy, from franchises that probably wouldn’t disappoint, but I was looking for something new, something interesting, something I hadn’t played before, and by golley did I find it. So just what is jazzpunk, you say? Well the short answer would be that it’s a walking sim, but the long answer would be a trippy, windy road, full of some of the most distinct hummer I’ve ever seen in a game.\n\nThe game opens up by dumping you off of a luggage conveyer belt, into a sweeping montage of abstract imagery, full of Japanese symbols, air planes, and radio waves. It looks like something that could have been taken from the intro of an old western movie, if the motif were jazz, and not the Wild West. When it’s over, you get tossed in something that looks like a 50’ds-60’ds office space, crossed with a train station, and yes you can immediately start talking to boxes that are lying around.\n\nA couple of minutes later and boom you’re in the full swing of the games plot, working as a secret agent  for the “Director”, and his “Secretary”. Right when you sit down on the whoopee cushion, to talk to your new boss, little white cartoonish lines come out of his eyes directing you towards you’re first mission objective, which is to raid some kind of Russian compound. Rite from the get go, you can get a good idea of what this games all about. Then you take you’re happy pills and go off into crazy land. This kind cartoonish hummer is bursting forth from almost every inch of the game. And that’s defiantly its strongest point, unlike most other walking sims this game won’t ever leave you board, whether you’re talking to insane hobos, hipster pies, that where sunglasses, and smok cigarettes, or talking to sexy female robots, there is always some business to poke your nose into. The game is also full of crazy side quests that you can get from talking to said persons such as; destroying clay pots in a fly shop, helping a frog cross the freeway to get his startreck data visor, catching huge spiders in a glass jar, in some Japanese themed restaurant, just to throw them on the cook’s face, who hates spiders.\n\nThis game is full of WTF moments that will have you smiling, and laughing out loud, as it pulls out gage after gage, most of which can be traced back to classic Ren and Stimpy cartoon's, and video game hummer. I even remember thinking halfway through the game “Ok, when are they going to start playing The Thieving Magpie theme?” and sure enough, there it was in the final level. But it’s really more than a one trick pony as far as the type of gages the game pulls off. Some of them are dialog based, some teleport you into areas where you are fighting cars, street fighter style in first person, and others are things like pulling an ice alarm, that’s located right next the proper fire alarm. Ice alarm, “for what reason”, one might ask one’s self? Why, for the same reason the hallway right next to it has a caution "greased up floor" sign on it. “Well that doesn’t make any sense.” you might say, however to that I would say, “Nothing in this game makes sense.”, but it's still a blast.\n\nIf you’re into shooting pigeon’s with crazy magnet guns taking their guts, and spraying "essence of pigeon" on other people, while other pigeons flock to them, to carry them off into the sky, then you will probably have fun with this game. Perhaps I write this review in vain, as it’s difficult to put into words what this game exactly is, but it’s defiantly worth playing. The only complaint I have is that it’s pretty short, if it had 2-3 more missions it would have been perfect. 9/10","July 3, 2014","true","6.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It is just silly and smart enough to make it worth recommending. On the surface the plot of Jazzpunk seems insignificant but there is quite a bit that is left implied that encourages thought. I finished the game in about two hours, however that isn't exactly a problem: the game relies on its humor and I could see it getting stale if the game were a few more hours long. If I had trouble with anything during my time with Jazzpunk, it was the soundtrack. It is a fantastic soundtrack and works excellently with the game, however when exploring the levels sometimes the looped music would become grating. It doesn't offer much in replayability either but there is a lot of variety to the game, offering some neat minigames and secrets. If you are interested in some memorable comedy, Jazzpunk has you covered.\n\nI paid ~$0.33 for Jazzpunk as part of the Humble Weekly Bundle: Extra Life 2015 bundle.","June 6","true","2.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As much as I enjoy these walking simulator games like The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and The Stanley Parable, Jazzpunk does not meet the quality you expect from these games by its narrative, immersion nor in its writing (especially its humor).\n\nWarning: Epilepsy Gamers, Beware.\nI wouldn't recommend this game as the intro screen and various moments in the game have tons of flashing lights.\n\nChalk Full of Gags, Little Else\nComedy is not something I'm going to critique the game for. It's too subjective, but I think I know who it's audience. This game comes across as another Youtube Bait game (Goat Simulator, etc.). The humor only seems to work off of "LOL RANDOM NONSENSE, WHAT DO YOU THINK?", which makes the game itself feel shallow to play alone.\n\nThe game is chalk full of random mini-games, techy/nerdy/video-game references, and tons of open environments with various gags to be found. If you explore everything and exhaust all the dialogue, you'll probably get five decent hours of a playthrough.\n\nBut with so many unnecessary nonsense gags, you might grow tired from the game's charm after the first area. And don't expect getting a narrative worth those five hours (at best).\n\nIf You Still Want It, Buy It On A Sale\nThere's nothing for me to analyze in its mechanics nor anything story-wise to keep me interested in reviewing Jazzpunk.\n\nI liked the aesthetic, the soundtrack and the spy-hero gags/moments of the game. I wanted more of the riddiculous espionage humor, but that gets burried amongst the LOL moments that I quickly grew bored of.\n\nSome people may enjoy the more obscure references and the novelty of Jazzpunk.\n\nI sure don't see the appeal of a game of easter eggs.

It tried way too hard to be funny but the lack of quality and variety in the art and voice acting just didn't do it for me.\n\nTone down the polygon count and some textures and this is something you could find on N64, yet the performance was still abysmal.  It seems as though there's a memory leak or something because sometimes performance gets progressively worse after certain events.  A 6-core CPU with a R9 290 should be able to handle this game.\n\nI have often found myself struggling to point polyblank in a specific direction (when using a mouse+keyboard) where my view would sometimes change by 30 degrees when the mouse pointer may have only moved by 1 pixel.  Incredibly annoying.  I often found myself walking backwards towards a doorway since it was the only way I could control the direction I was moving in.\n\nThe music in the game was crap, most "songs" only lasted maybe 20 seconds at most, and they were all on loop.  They also sounded like they had a 64Kbps compression.  On top of that, the volume of many sound effects are way too loud.\n\nYou can't lose at the game and it gives absolutely no incentive to try anything.  I could complete an achievement and the game never acknowledges it.  The game is hardly a good time waster.\n\nI have played free games made by amateurs that were more fun and higher quality than this.  Even without the technical issues, this would be the worst game I own on Steam by far.","November 19, 2014","false","2.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I've always had a thing for the Eisenhower/JFK era: late 50s early 60s. I also had the pleasure to live in Japan, but my Pops, he had the pleasure to live in Japan during the Cold War. I play games not to get away, but to explore worlds I could never go in real life. This is the closest to 1960s Japan I'll probably ever get.\n\nJazzpunk is a first person exploration game. There's no real firm location except for one chapter.  The story is not very cut and dry. You play the role of a freelance "Spy" operative. It's never really stated who you ultimately work for, but know The Director is your boss. Really, the story is not it's strength. It's more of a visual adventure into someone's trippy mind. You interact with the world and watch the results. Gags, and jokes galore. Oh the gags! It's hard to categorize the game, the fun is in your curiosity. Walk around each location, and EXPLORE. It's a visual piece of art in my opinion, and the art design is superb. A "retro-futuristic" (think The Jetsons) Japanese aesthetic all thrown into a blender and somehow not coming out as sloppy as you would think. The music has it's strength. It works VERY well with the world. I can't even categorize the music...Latin, Bassnova, Jazz, 1950s shopping music???\n\nThe few cons I have is the price tag. Its a very short game, and the content may not justify the price for some. I also noticed other reviewers reporting motion sickness. For me, this was true. The camera is very sensitive to controls and I found myself getting sick. POV movement is quick and fast. Changing sensitivity might help.\n\nThis is one my favorite games ever, and I wish there was more to it. I never thought I'd see the day Quake, Street Fighter; It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World and Johnny "Cache" all get referenced in one piece of artwork! Luis Hernandez is definitley on another world. Glad he chose to share it with us. If you have an open mind, if you have an interest in the culture of the 50s and 60s; or if you just want to try something different, this game is for you. One last thing: did Japan win the war in this universe?\n\nThanks for the trip Mr. Hernandez.

I want to recommend it, but at £10 for a 2 hour game, im a little disappointed. No real replayability, Short, and the doesn't give you much.\n\nThe content is good, The  comedy, the puzzles... if you can call them that. I a ton of pop culture references. Just too short.\n\nI did like scanning in the QR Code on the Pig :)","February 8, 2014","false","2.2"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","0"

References to things from years ago can be funny but when the majority of the comedy is only references then things that are prominent today will be more funny and less reaching.  as a game goes it is simplistic with an uninspired story and only 2 and a half hours of gameplay.  There are some really funny moments but the lasting power of those moments goes away quickly as you are constantly assaulted with these moments and references as the game is trying to scream at you "look Im funny".  The way to get the most of your entertainment out of this game is to do everything before you actually complete your main objective which is a plus for the game to have some open exploration.\n\nMy final thoughts are simply that this game is pretty fun but has no challenge or real level of "game" to it; as it is trying to make you laugh with it's hit and miss comedy.  the overalll value however is what makes me have to say I would not recomend it because this is a 2 and a half hour game with little to no replayability what so ever.  Much like with a joke or comedy sketch you can only see it so many times before the punch is gone and you laugh more so out of politness than being actually entertained, and this game at $12 for 2 hours of content really makes me want alot more either game length or replayability.","February 8, 2014","false","2.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

Why do I not recomend it? The biggest problem is the FOV. It is way too small. Please search Jazzpunk motion sickness. This game will cause most people to experience nausia or just feel terrible. I want to love this interactive gallery, but I simply can't sit down and enjoy it without feeling sick. Hopefully the developers will make a patch eventually to make it playable but that does not really look like it will be happening any time soon.\n\nThe writing is entertain and it is fun to explore except for the sick feeling.","October 1, 2014","false","2.6"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

Yes, mini-game. Look at the reviewers' game time. Around 2 hours, that's it. So while it was a memorable playthrough, it's ridiculously short for the price.
