Sora tells the story of its namesake: the lone enhanced human, Sora, and her struggle to protect a fading world. Enjoy breathtakingly fast-paced combat in the Suguri universe, with improved game system and graphics along with original trance music by DEKU.\n\nGameplay ElementsOnto the gameplay elements, I absolutely adore the “customization” that you can bring in 3 weapons of your choice which could be unlocked by progressing in the game which will be stronger than the stock weapons that is provided when you start out, and you can either use the unlocked weapons or just use the stock weapons to make the game more challenging.\n\nIn Sora sometimes you may find yourself using a sword or a melee attack which at first glance seems dangerous but it is a high risk high reward type of attack because when the attack connects, a short term and small barrier is formed that blocks off incoming attacks and that is what made the melee attack useful and usable.\n\nControlsI am playing Sora on PC with a keyboard and the controls are good. The default settings are are well thought out and it can be fully customize allowing you to bind any buttons you want on the keyboard. [no cramping of 2 hands onto 1 side of the keyboard] I think having a good controls are very important because who wants to play a game with 2 hands overlapping each other? That would be pure discomfort and a hassle to play.\n\nA element you will take notice off is the soundtracks, the soundtracks are really great they fit into the battle that is happening in your screen it just makes the whole game feel more immersive and “cool” like you are really part of the fight, I absolutely love the soundtracks.\n\nDo I recommend this game?Do i recommend Sora? Yes, I definitely recommend you to pick it up if you are a fan off bullet hell and great soundtracks.\nIn addition, everyone who owns Sora will receive a free bonus character in 100% Orange Juice on Steam.\n\nClick here for the full review there is videos and images[azusantiara.wordpress.com]","January 5","true","61.4"," 59 of 71 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","59","71","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anonymous_Neko/recommended/390730/","Anonymous_Neko","Anonymous_Neko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anonymous_Neko/","185 products in account","At the time of this writing, I have completely beaten Sora on easy mode in a span of 2 hours with the default loadout, no I’m not kidding.\n\nSo I think it’s time for me to write a review on this particular type of schmup game that is Sora. Also note that I initially bought another version of this game on GamersGate a year ago which explains how I was able to beat it so easily. The game (on GG) is unpurchasable as far as I know. Of course, this version easily takes that juicy cake.\n\nTo begin with, Sora is basically a unique 2D side-scrolling bullet hell game similar to Suguri from the same company that made the popular board game 100% Orange Juice where you play as a young biogenetically enhanced/engineered human girl and defected soldier named Sora through 9 stages (including tutorial and extra stage) in the Suguri/Sora universe and let me warn you, this thing is ♥♥♥♥ hard even on easy. I only managed to beat it because of the countless hours I spent on the Ωth’s version.\n\nNow what makes this one different from the Ωth’s is that now it has better translation, window/fullscreen/borderless mode support, better visual quality and all that other fancy smancy stuff.\n\nTo the actual review:\n\nStoryline I am quite familiar with the Suguri/Sora universe and thus I could absorbed some of the scenes and reference they made. I don’t believe you need to pick up Suguri first if you haven’t yet since there are little said scenes in these 9 stages. Though if you did get Suguri first then you’ll probably able to piece the timeline together. *cough*  Sora is a prequel of Suguri  *cough*\n\nGameplay One word: “repetitive”. Since even on easy you’ll get rained on by a lot and I mean A LOT of ♥♥♥♥♥torms coming for Sora’s head, you will inevitably die from turning to a wrong corner. Expect much rage on this one. Heck I even screamed because some boss had a speck of health left and turned ♥♥♥♥ing Rambo before I had time to shield up. Though by reaching a certain milestone, you can unlock different weapons.\n\nGraphics Can even run on a potato-powered toaster(not really) and looks better than Suguri. The colorful sparks and light effects from beams and explosions are also enjoyable to watch and add to the fast-paced and intensity of any battle.  Epileptics be warned. Also for those who played on a potato-powered toaster, things may get clunky if you have too much bullets filling up your screen.\n\nMusic There are tracks that I am not fond of and there are tracks that are one of my most favorite track of all time. Sometimes you just don’t pay attention to the music at all since the high paced gameplay gives you no room to enjoy them. If you get the chance, try to listen to some of them  it’s possible to rip them off from the .dat file but don’t ask me how. There are music tracks with English vocals too. For me those are a nice touch.\n\nVoice There are Japanese voice acting but limited only in the final boss fight. This is just frostings on the cake but you’ll get to hear what the deadpan Sora sounds like. Easily 10/10 out of me\n\nControls You can play it on a keyboard or a standard XInput controller or even a DirectInput controller. I used the latter (I live in the Stone Age I know). I recommend playing it on a controller. It allows for easier controls and may reduce difficulty significantly for most people since you’ll become more nimble. Keyboard works… but stupid. Just stop… please.\n\nMy Verdict  (8.5/10)\nA fast-paced bullet hell game that will guarantee you some sort of rage if you don’t have what it takes to dodge any sort of projectile coming towards you. Also requires a lot of reflexes and hand eye-coordination skillz. The game is enjoyable for a few hours and the repetitiveness will get to you eventually except for those who enjoy unlocking new weapons and achieving high scores or just enjoy spending time with Sora in general. *cough*  like me  *cough*\nMinus one because of a certain bug involving the big ♥♥♥ sword and half a one for repetitiveness.\n\nCheck out my nifty Sora-related artworks over at my profile gallery","January 6","true","5.8"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","15","16","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/recommended/390730/","Lobinbe","Lob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lobinbe/","301 products in account","Sham is a cutie <3\n\nBullet hells are typically fairly formulaic in fashion, mostly being based around pure dodging in a vertically-oriented screen space with focused movement, small hitboxes allowing for grazing and oftentimes you have your standard bullet-cancelling scoring tricks. Orange Juice had subverted most of these tropes in Suguri, and continue to polish their style of danmaku gameplay in the sequel Sora.\n\nThe main nuance to this series is that instead of the standard focused movement, you can perform a dash that sends you flying quickly across the screen. This dash allows you to phase through bullets and standard lasers, but you are still susceptible to physical obstacles such as rockets, dashing also builds up your heat gauge which makes you take even more damage (up to 3 times more damage at 300%). This along with the dashing being used to cancel out shot inputs makes most of the depth in this game, as fighting becomes a visceral mix of shooting and dashing around enemy bullets and rockets, as you try to destroy everything as fast as possible. The potential of these mechanics are realized as each boss plays differently and demand different skills and understanding of mechanics from the player. For example, Tsih can temporarily go invisible meaning that you cannot lock-on to them during this time and you will have to use melee attacks against them, whereas Sham surrounds you with smaller swarming enemies which require switching your lock-on frequently.\n\nAlthough you can phase through most projectiles, this game is in no way easy. If you are new or relatively new to the series like I was when starting this game, it will take you a while to get used to the fast pace of enemy attacks and the sheer density of projectiles at certain points. The game has quite a steep learning curve that will challenge those experienced with bullet hells along with a grading system at the end of each stage which makes the act of playing Sora feel rewarding and addictive.\n\nLike its predecessor, Sora oftentimes feels like a blend between a fighting game and a shmup, especially due to the addition of swords and other melee weapons that you can use. The scoring system capitalises on this, as it rewards players who can play aggressively and take out hordes of enemies swiftly without taking damage. The addictive mechanics are topped off with an improved visual presentation from Suguri and a great trance-style soundtrack that succeeds in giving each boss a lasting impression.\n\nAll in all, Sora feels like an ideal sequel to suguri, as it further expands on the innovations made by suguri with new weapons, abilities, boss fights and certain balance changes. If you are at all a fan of the doujin circle Orange_Juice you would be doing yourself a great disservice by missing out on Sora.","January 22","true","15.2"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","0"

So gameplay wise, if you enjoyed Suguri you'll definitely like Sora, especially with the latter's refinements over the original. For example, dash spamming has been nerfed in general--initiating a dash will boost your Heat by about 30%, thus making it more risky to turn on a dime. You also gain Heat from attack cancelling, making that riskier as well. The difficulty curve also feels less abrupt than in Suguri (I still have PTSD from that Kae fight), and scales more linearly. Furthermore, the weapons have been rebalanced making most of the worse weapons from Suguri more viable.\n\nIn terms of length, it took me around 9 hours or so to beat story mode (stages 1-7) on easy, so there's quite a bit of content, along with the fantastic OST. Even if you're not so good at these games like I am, you should be able to progress atleast on easy.","January 14","true","11.5"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

A worthy successor to Suguri for sure.  It really feels like they took everything great about Suguri and polished it to perfection.  The game is fast and very challenging.  It demands your full attention; blinking can be the difference between life and death.  There were numerous times where I simply had to keep my eyes open for as long as I could.  The game looks beautiful.  The story isn't overly complicated and is nice and simple.  However, it has a hook that keeps you invested.  The world is gloomy and in a dire state.  This is reflected by Sora's internal struggle and her longing to help.  Ending up empathizing with Sora is easy to do as you progress through her trials.\n\nThe soundtrack is beautiful.  It compliments the gameplay and the setting perfectly.  Love this game, and I'd recommend it to anyone, especially those looking for a real challenge.","April 15","true","27.7"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetto_/recommended/390730/","Zetto_","Zetto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zetto_/","253 products in account","I honestly never would have thought this game would come to steam.\n\nThis game, Sora, is the sequel to the game Suguri, which was published by Rockin' Android. You are Sora, an enhanced, basically mechanized superhuman fighting in a neverending war that seems to encompass all of Earth, and your goal is to make people stop fighting... by shooting rockets into their faces. Nobody said peacekeeping was easy!\n\nAnyway, this is actually the second time the game has been localized. The first time was done by--I guess you can call them a person--called OmegaTH, who, bluntly speaking, screwed the pooch in localizing it. Horrific translations, Pointless name changes, terrible bugs, missing music I believe, game breaking DRM, the improper use of the word "Reploid" were just a few of the things that you could have expected from that localization.\n\nIt seemed the game was doomed to be stuck in a kind of limbo where it was basically as good as never released in the US.\n\nAt least until Fruitbat factory came outta nowhere and decided through the darkest of magic rituals to obtain the license to the game and give it the release it deserved.\n\nThe game has none of the aforementioned problems of the previous localization, integrates with the steam overlay without any flaws, seems to control flawlessly (I've read it "feels" off compared to the Japanese version, though I cannot confirm that), and just exudes a lot of the love and care put into it to make it a fine release. The only minor flaw I could think of is some slowdown during the more intense bossfights, though there are options to remove blur effects and the likes to mitigate it. Aside from that the game is as good as it can get.\n\nThey did the impossible saw the invisible and should have the highest praise from everyone for just going where I would figure no one else would try to do.\n\nAnyway, it's an awesome game that anyone who is a fan of great shmups,  good video game music, or just anyone looking for a fun challenge, should pick up.","January 21","true","19.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hatsunator/recommended/390730/","hatsunator","hatsunator","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hatsunator/","65 products in account","= Forward =\nBefore I get to the review I will admittedly say that I pre-ordered this game and it's soundtrack on the premise of getting the free character "Sora (Military)" for "100% Orange Juice" and to just have some extra music to listen to.\n\nI booted the game up just over 6 months (yesterday) after it's release on a whim to see if it would provide a good break from the usual titles I had been playing and it instantly became a title I'm going to remember for a long time.\n\n= Review =\n- Initial experience with gameplay -\n\nIt's been about a year since I last played a bullet hell shooter so I was basically coming in as good as the general noob and I have to say it was an interesting experience to get thrashed as hard as I did on easy.\n\n11 hours in and I finaly beat easy (minus the extra and boss rush) but I realised something as I went through the story mode.\n\nMuch like 'getting good' in the popular "Dark Souls" I stopped over analyzing things and began the trend of analyzing how I died and then remembered what caught me off guard.\n\nThe game had soon turned from a screen filled torrent of death to an intricate maze of paterns.\n\nI realize that this is common hat for the geanre but I found "Sora" more forgiving than other giants such as "Touhou" and more challenging than something like "Trouble Witches NEO".\n\nIt was refreshing to know that I was able to grasp victory eventually.\n\nThe boss that gave me the biggest headache to beat was Lv 3's boss with 28 attempts to show how terrible I was at the beginning.\n\nEvery other boss in the game thus far for me has been under 10 attempts.\n\n- Gameplay Features -\n\nAnother interesting facet that I found in this game that I hadn't seen before was the Dash/Heat feature and the Weapon System.\n\nThe Dash and Heat features in the game provide a nice ease of use and risk/reward set-up. where dashing lets you pass through 80% of the attacks comming at you but using it increases the damage you take coming out of it.\n\nIt was an interesting mechanic that let my noob self get accustomed to the enemies and my skilled self work on getting the fastest times possible with not a single hit.\n\nWith the weapon set-up the game outright presented itself as one who can be solved with no one key combination.\n\nI found myself experimenting with different weapons to see how I could manage the levels and while I can say I royally flopped with some I can clearly see their usefullness to some one more skilled or of a different mind-set.\n\nI would also like to note that almost all the weapons are unlocked on attempt count wrather than level completion count.\n\nThat alone let me quickly adapt and grow with the weapons that I loved and compare them with other unique weapons.\n\nWhich is great for people who are wanting to experiment early on or are frustrated with certain bosses.\n\n- Presentation -\n\nI decided to read up on the development blog post made by the devs at Orange Juice and I have to say I appreciate everything that this game is asthetically.\n\nEverything about the geanre of Danmaku and Bullet Hells is supposed to feel nostalgic no mater the rendering.\n\nLike an old arcade title you toss coins into, this game has out-and-in gameplay done wonderfully.\n\nI can count at most 6 seconds going from a death anywhere in the game to booting the level back up and beginning my next attempt.\n\n- Characters and Story -\n\nI've played both 100% Orange Juice and 200% Mixed Juice extensively so I've always wondered what the character's source material from all the OJ games were about.\n\nI was surprised that Sora's story was as interesting as it was.\n\nThere isn't much dialouge in the game and only a couple of scenes are voiced but the dialouge that does happen gives all the info you need on the characters and the conflict.\n\nThe dialouge is a little rough on the translation side and the wording is quite simple but I will say that I found the story quite gripping despite that.\n\n- Visual Asthetics -\n\nThe're is an odd simplicity to the graphics and yet the high resolution brings out so much in it's environment.\n\nThe levels and stages were quite stunning to have as backdrops to the on screen action as the break-up points in combat always lead to some sort of transformation in the background to warn you of the imposing doom or to show your movement through the world.\n\nThe Menu and UI are also clean and crisp to give a perfect ci-fi tone.\n\nI believe it's one of the best I've seen.\n\n- Audio -\n\nThe game has a stunning Trance soundtrack that I'm happy was released for sale.\n\nThe high speed and mixture of light and dark atmospheres in the game are perfectly matched to the level themes.\n\nTwo of the boss songs even have vocal which caught me off guard.\n\n= The Final Verdict =\nWhile my play time hasn't been massive as of now I know quite well it will be.\n\nThis game has instantly gripped me both in it's asthetic and wildly fun gameplay that is more immediately forgiving than other bigger bullet hell series.\n\nIt invoked nostalgia in me even though I'm someone who has not played a lot of this geanre and generally unfamilliar with the developers material.\n\nThe big thing that made me fall in love with the game was it's match of visual and sound.\n\nI will be looking to this game if anyone ever asks me what an asthetically correct game looks like.\n\nI'm dissapointed in myself for not trying this game sooner and will be brushing off the dust on un-played titles more often.\n\nI will ultimately give this game a 9 / 10 for it's approachability and solid design as the dialouge is really the only big flaw I can give it.\n\nThanks Orange Juice and Fruite Bat Factory for this title that will inspire my own game design.","May 25","true","18.7"," 1 person

Under-performing weapons have been sharpened, and those that bordered on overkill have been dialled down a bit. There’s a greater sense of punishment for dash abusers, and a refining of the oft-fuzzy visuals. Scoring chains are also a bit more reasonable, no longer punishing you unfairly for pauses in between the action. But it’s that distinction between the girl soldiers and the pedestrian weapons of war that remains the game’s highest selling point. Most missions see you take on the obligatory weapon platforms, massive tanks or attack crafts, but end-of-level bosses match you against a girl with similar talents, forcing you to unlearn a lot of the scrolling shooter tropes that have been drilled into your head.\n\nFull Review // http://www.honestgamers.com/12813/pc/sora/review.html","January 5","true","9.5"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

Even if you don't get stuck, have fun at level two.\nYou get a variety of weapons through 8 stages in order to stop the war as Sora, a perfect cyborg who is trying on their own to stop the war from destroying absolutely everything. Your tools at the beginning are shields, a bazooka, a beam rifle, and the ability to dash through energy projectiles to charge your hyper gauge for an overpowered attack to combat against some of the crazy barrages the enemies throw at you.\nOverall, Sora is a solid successor to Suguri, which enjoyed only a small following before it hit Steam under a (rather poor) rival publisher, and may or may not be accompanied by an excellent fighting game.\n\nI have to give this thumbs up for obvious reasons.","January 5","true","12.2"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","5"

On the surface I loved the look of this game and I love me some anime stuff as much as the next guy. Call me dumb but i partially bought this game for the story (probably a mistake) but also you know, I have played a few of this shoot 'em up like games (well maybe only one I can remember) but still I really wanted to see what this game was like.\n\nSo... I play the tutorial, okay seems striaghtforward enough, after that I am flung into what i assume is level one after some cut scenes backstory etc.,a and I manage to scrape my way through level 1 (I think?) which its fair im just picking this up I dont expect to master this game in 10 minutes, but hey at least I am progressing. After that im sent back to the now existant start menu after another little cutscene. Okay! i guess this means I can continue the story so i go to story mode, only to find the only levels I can play are the tutorial and the level I JUST BEAT. I then Think to myself alright maybe I just gotta beat this level once more to get this rolling.\n\nI load it up it asks for difficulty level I think okay, Normal seems like a fair place even though it states its for people who are "used to the game"  whatever that means? Well that is where the fun stops the level I just beat, cant beat it again... I tried at least 8 times or so and COULD NOT even get close to beating it. I really believe in a challenging games but playing the first level over and over and over again just aint fun. It is honestly quite demoralizing I am I terrible at this game or something?\n\nIs this what is meant by bullet hell? Forced to relive your death on the first level of a game over and over unable to even experience the core of a game? Feeling despair knowing you will not clear the level when only halfway through? I dont know, all I know is in my opinion playing a game on normal difficulty should be a challenging but doable experience when playing this game I feel this game does not neccessarily fit that so well...\n\nI am not sure if there is something I am missing but I just find myself frustrated, and I personally refuse to lower a game to "easy" difficulty as it honestly just feels like cheating to me, but hey maybe I am just flawed in my ways.\n\nFrom what I can actually experience this game looks great love the whole vibe of it, and I really wanted to experience the story (I cant really comment on whether it is good or not as i cannot readily experience it) It seems like it may be fairly priced but again not sure how much content is really in here. I found this game very frustrating and not very fun as apparently im not even good enough at it to actually play it...  If you dont mind being frustrated i guess take a whack at it if you wish... But I really would not recommend this unless your really into this genre.","June 4","false","1.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I really hate Steam's binary rating system.)\n\nFor more reviews, and a short gameplay video, check out probablysanny.wordpress.com !\n\nI was quickly frustrated when I started playing Sora. The game isn't unfair, it just does an incredibly poor job of communicating it's boss mechanics. You'll have no idea what you're supposed to be doing the first time in a fight, maybe even the second and third. Sora expects you to figure things out on your own, which can be extremely frustrating. If you're interested in playing this game, I suggest patience. If you persist, it's quite enjoyable.\n\nUnlike other shmups, in Sora, you can't just hold down the fire button. When you attack, you are forced to stand still for a brief period, and are left vulnerable. You can cancel out of these attacks, but I found the sudden change in momentum jarring at first. It takes a while to get used to if you've played other shmups before. But, I think this unique mechanic is the only real edge Sora has.\n\nYou can equip 3 weapons before each stage. Generally, a rifle, a rocket and a melee weapon, although there are some exceptions, such as mines. The melee weapons are very high risk/reward and add a bit more variety to the combat.\n\nI'm not a big fan of Sora's artstyle, but it isn't objectively bad. I think the hand-drawn characters have a certain cute charm to them, even if I don't really appreciate it. However, The combination of the playable character and bosses as 2-D sprites with the 3-D enemies and backgrounds certainly put me off. They don't feel like they belong in the same game, but the problem is mostly ignorable after the first few minutes of gameplay.\n\nThe music isn't as great as other soundtracks I've heard recently, but I still enjoyed it. I especially liked the track that plays in Stage 7, however ironically. The Engrish vocals are just too good for me to ignore, I smile every time.\n\nSora lacks an overall level of polish. The visuals look a bit off, the gameplay isn't as smooth as it should be, and there are a lot strange design choices. I have no idea how the weapon unlock system works, they seem to randomly appear after stages every now and then, regardless of how well I performed. Is it simply tied to how many stages I've played? Are there secret tasks you have to perform? I have no idea.\n\nI don't think Sora is a brilliant example of bullet-hells, and I don't feel like I'm really in the intended audience, but I still had a lot of fun with it. It's interesting enough to set it apart from it's competition, so if you're really itching for something new, I'd recommend picking it up. There are probably better options out there to sate your bullet-hell fix, but I wouldn't ignore Sora entirely.","February 22","false","4.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Sora is right up your alley then. But for me, Sora provided an experience that immediately overloaded my frustration meter. A good amount of it comes down to the design of the game. While the heat and dodge mechanics are interesting and work at their core level, the level design leads to TOO much chaos on screen, that happens in an unpredicatable way at times. The game despite having a cancel system to counteract it, asks for reaction times that are way too small, and this is complemented by some unfair elements such as getting hit off screen, or asking too much of the player (by having hints of where boulders are coming in such a light hue of color that you're literally squinting to see it). It's a game that falls apart when it comes together, as while some elements definitely could work on their own with the aesthetic and the music, they don't combine together very well and don't complement each other in terms of gameplay. If you have a high frustration limit, then Sora's core combat will intrigue you. But if you don't, all you'll be doing is cursing.\n\nVideo Review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgu0_Bw-xec\n\nLists:\n+:\nCore concept and gameplay works, in particular with the dodge/heat mechanic. Risk/reward element in that case works, as there's reasons to dodge and reasons NOT to dodge at certain times.\nCancel mechanic interesting on the surface, allowing for more tactics and keeping the action up. Again, good reasons to use and not use at certain times.\nLike the fact in particular that just MOVING makes sense at times, as opposed to dodging. For some games, it becomes too reliant on those dodge mechanics.\nControls work for the most part. Dodging may be too fast, but good control.\nTrance music soundtrack works to complement the action very well.\n-:\nElements of unfair difficulty. Get regularly hit by things off screen or asking way too much of a player to react to.\nSome games are a sum of their parts, but that's not Sora. Elements feel like that don't connect very well together, like different teams were working on\nAesthetic clashes with gameplay. Hard to see live ammo makes dodging it rather difficult, and too much happening on screen can lead to your eyes straining at the smallest thing.\nFelt like the dodging mechanic could have done better with a more open level design. The speed at which you dodge and the amount of space to work with don't seem to complement very well.\nLock on can get really annoying at times, due to the having to turn it off in certain cases. Especially on cases where an enemy is too big for the screen.\nSound design is lacking in certain places, not allowing for a good Oompf factor. Characters end up feeling a little lifeless because of this.\nSome polish issues. Needs prompts to indicate options at times (skipping with the LockOn Button) In battle menu should have the ability to go to the options menu.","January 5","false","5.3"," 26 of 67 people (39%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","39","26","67","3","12"

Which makes destroying projectiles guessing games at best.\nBeam attacks are stupidly random, where certain beam attacks cannot be dashed past, but then they teach you you're supposed to dash vs beam attacks? Why even...?\n\nMelee weapons are incredibly useless, their damage is laughable at best and only promote the idea of staying long range and keeping the highest priority to dodge stuff.\nThere's no reward for being risky with a melee weapon, and in various instances beam weapons seem to easily outdps projectile and melee attacks.\n\nThere are no base attack values or any form of attack damage calculations or functions which teach you in the game and makes the training stages tips about knowing the damage you inflict with weapons completely negligible\n\nBeam attacks have a very... VERY slow rate of fire and usually promote animation cancelling as a way of life, instead of a quirky reward for being quick on controls.\n\nRocket Launchers are the same thing, however you're also inclined to suffer through their poor projectile speed which is so lazy any idea of even thinking their a threat to dodge is a joke. It makes the idea of simply destroying the projectiles as a strategy of minimizing threat a smart idea, but without any form of control/targetting onto missiles, the idea is hastily culled.\n\nThe last thing I want to mention is the boss design. They're all the same\nThey all have this rather lazy blink around, "ha you cant target me! wait until my boring invicibility frame has ended while I charge my ultimate attack!?!"\nAnd well... it's pretty dull XD\nThough it doesn't really impede on the game THAT much... the strategies used to fight bosses only differ around the idea of survivability which is one thing I do like. However the blink factor is hella annoying!\nThe other thing I don't like is that there are no... not so obvious weaknesses from bosses that you can exploit or use as a way to optimize the boss fight for fast times and quickest possible kills\nIt's just, shoot, dodge their stuff, shoot again.  The weapons you acquire don't give you a dynamic advantage against bosses or enemies... they're just weapons.\nIf there was weaknesses, resistances which punish you for your weapon choices and demand you change things around, where you have to use your melee, missile or beam attacks specifically. This would be an awesome touch to the game!\n\nIf I had to suggest any solution to the above, i'd state the following:\n1) Make missile projectiles much faster, so dodging them is an actual challenge.\nThis works both ways, for Sora's attacks and for enemy attacks.\n\n2) Either nerf beam attack power and increase their rate of fire. Or set a more dynamic difference between beam and missile attacks. Missiles either have the faster rate of fire but with projectile travel distance & time in mind.\nOr make beam attack rates faster and make beams designed to be weak & fast for rapid fire design or design beam rifles so you can fire and move simutaneously with weaker damage and more heat gain\n\n3) Make melees stronger and more dynamic,\nThere needs to be a substancial reward in going close range. Especially when 99% of enemies simutaneously fire missiles and beam attacks at the same time.\nAlso design SOME melee enemies. To create more unpredictability and interesting encounters, it doesn't do justice when every boss attacks that fall under the condition of "Melee" are all long range attacks that you're just forced to dodge and survive from\n\n4) Animation cancelling should not be a necessity\nThis kind of annoys me but at the same time, it's a live and learn kind of thing.\nI just think the game design makes you rely heavily on the idea of this mechanic, and in some places would be hilarious if they made a boss where it punishes you for doing it, instead of just a bucket of rewards, and your only route to fast rate of fire.\n\n5) Make bosses physically move around, instead of blinking lazily to 1 corner of the screen\nThe bosses are incredibly immobile, and half the time the blink function that they use simply makes the boss fight tedious instead of challenging.\nwhen they're stationary for such a long time before they blink, it makes targetting/attacking them so easy, and it forces a routine of simply shoot, dodge, shoot dodge.\nPerhaps things will get harder in a sequel or something, but i think its worth considering.\n\nWhat I love about this game?\n\nIt's simple for starters, and that's something I appreciate!\nI'm tired of all these graphic ♥♥♥♥♥s of games where it's so easy to just read where the majority of development spent there time.\nThis game is easy on the eyes, with a niche anime touch to it, which actually makes it pleasant to look at, instead of eye blinding.\n\nTrial and error feel\nI love this a lot! Theres a trial and error theme to this game, where perfection is the main objective.\nTrying to complete a level without taking damage is a hell of a fun challenge which demands a good memory, reactions and a strong learning attitude.\nIf you're into games with trial and error factors, this game will definately be a good one for you\n\nSora is adorable\nNuff sed! I want Sora plush-dolls <3\n\nDecent weapon variety\nOk i'll admit I'm kind of on the fence with this one. And this is probably a major point which mitigates my rant about the weapon designs.\nThe weapon variety is cool. don't get me wrong. and its nice to have a lot of stuff to try out, and a slight explorational grind where completing one level multiple times in hopes for more weapons is a viable thing to do.\nBut it's the base design of the weapons which I feel makes it suck. They all have the same weaknesses. And the enemies dont exploits the weapon flaws in ways you can, which makes for a rather linear experience.\n\nStages are short and sweet, but full of action\nThere's rarely a dull moment during a stage, especially if you run with arcade mode.\nIt has a great flow to it, and it's very smooth with nice music to keep you tied to the game, and have a good time!\nI love the soundtracks, they definately make the experience twice as fun.\n\nPlot and expansion potential\nThere's a lot of potential for this game, such as expansion and sequels.\nI really hope they make a sequel to this game, or it's at least considered. This is a game where simply adding more stages, weapons and whatnot, would definately go a long way.\nEven the idea of a stage creator/weapon creator so fans can make their own input would be beyond amazing and I think it would create a lot of community based input, where players can download add-ons\n\nI would definately recommend this game.\nIt's fun, it's simple, and it has a great flow to the game.","January 9","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The people on earth have been fighting with each other for whatever reason. So basically you are a war asset and other things which I won't mention due to spoilers.\n\nGameplay\n--------------\nThe game is very very challenging. It's not as difficult as Suguri (The first game, Sora is the Prequel) but still not that easy. Mission 1 took me 1 try, Mission 2 took me 2 tries but Mission 3... Took me 15 and the scale gets higher until I reached Mission 5 Where I beat it on my first but the rest soon took longer to finish. So yeah, not too easy and not too difficult but for most I think they'd say its hard. Enough about difficulty, tiem for the gametype, It's a Bullet-Hell. But instead of moving around the energy bullets you can pass through them if you were to Use your "Dash" ability. However, you cannot dash through live ammunition (Eg. Missiles) and as you dash, you gain Heat. Heat can reach up to 300% and that would mean if you were to get hit... You will take much more damage. Heat would take about 8 seconds to settle *But you need to keep dodging too* so it's really bad if you are careless.In each mission, there are enemies which pop up throughout the mission (henchmen?), followed by a mid-stage boss which is there to prepare you for the true boss and at the end, the actual boss with a name and health bar. As I said before, You unlock even more weapons as you progress so you can ditch your sword for an even bigger sword *After dying 100 Times* I really like arcade games so this was a treat for me. If you don't like Bullet-hell games then you should just ignore this game.\n\nArt\n-----\nSora is such a freakin adorable character <3 (and some others too but no one can beat Sora imo)\nThe character sprites are really well done and pretty (Atleast to my taste). The level design is like it's from a ps2 era game so nothing special. The missiles and lasers you blast out (and or shot at you) are also well animated which givest he game more life.\n\nThat's about the only thing I can think to describe this nice and wonderful game. I hope they make a 3rd Installment to the story.\n\nMy Overall score for Sora: 8.5/10 considering the price and maybe because I'm biased.","January 14","true","27.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
