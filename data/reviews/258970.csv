You already know this is supposed to be an updated and modernized verion of the arcade classic.  You already know how they tried to make each character unique, with new elements: twin-stick shooting, MMO tactics, RPG progression, element-mixing magic.  You already know there's both couch and online co-op.\n\nAnd you know the other reviews aren't answering the one, fundamental question.  One that's hard to vocalize without sounding trivial.  It's about something that can't be measured, can't be analyzed or quantified.  It's about a feeling, a memory.\n\nIs this Gauntlet?  Is this *really* Gauntlet?\n\nAnd the answer involves a flashback.  Sorry in advance.\n\n1985 --  A group of 15 and 16 year-olds hits the arcade to get their videogame fix.  They were a standard 80s group of teens -- the preppie, the punk, the jock, the girl.  It was a group that didn't outwardly have much in common.  But not long ago, they discovered by accident two shared passions among them: video games, and Dungeons and Dragons.\n\nThat day in the arcade, they saw something.  Something new, something different, a game that spoke to both gamers in each of them.  Pixellated swords and sorcery.  Four, count 'em, four players at once.  Four characters, four classes, four roles.  All working towards a common goal: the next level.\n\nThese four unlikely friends each took a spot before the grand machine, somehow choosing characters in coordinated silence.  No discussion, just unspoken agreement.  The girl became Warrior, strongest of all.  The punk became Valkyrie, protector of the group.  The preppie became Elf, rogue and rebel.  The jock became Wizard, cerebral and calm.\n\nThe next hours were epic.\n\nFast-forward to 2014.  An old gamer sees an updated Gauntlet.  He sighs, remembering Dark Legacy and other kind-of fun but failed attempts to update and recreate the arcade classic.  But the reviews look positive, and YouTube videos show fun-looking gameplay.  What the heck, there's even a sale on 4-packs.\n\nThe next hours were epic ...\n\nThe answer is yes.\n\nYes, this is Gauntlet.\n\n(first Steam review ever, thanks for reading)","September 27, 2014","true","98.0"," 2,291 of 2,494 people (92%) found this review helpful 106 people found this review funny","92","291","2","106","70"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TraceofHatred/recommended/258970/","TraceofHatred","TraceofHatred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TraceofHatred/","52 products in account","Have to say as a whole, the game was not a bad game - However, I would not recommend buying it.The "feeling" of the game was very old school gauntlet (prior to Gauntlet Legends & Dark Legacy), the visuals were beautiful, Relics are an awesome new spin on the classic "Bomb Potion" we all know and love, and a lot of the other new additions were cool (Death is actually a challenge now!), but that's about it.\n\nWhere this game falls short is... pretty much everything else - Like Seven Sorrows, really.\nIt is a very short, very empty, and very unfinished game with a pitiful amount of content.\nIf you were hoping for old school Gauntlet with loads of levels, prepare to be let down.\n\nFor one: There are only 12 levels, split into 3 realms (A crypt, a cave, and a volcano) - Each of these realms comes with 3 sets of 3 (Always a normal stage, a random generated stage, and an arena), and then a fairly easy to defeat boss to deal with as the fourth and final chapter level.\n\nYou paid $19.99 for a 3.5 Hour game (The original Gauntlet? The game this is based on? Pretty sure that game was endless honestly, it had HUNDREDS of levels - Even Dark Legacy took 12 hours to beat on 2 player and had 60 Levels, more than 5 times the amount of levels this game has!)\nI've played the game solo, and I've played it through twice nearly with a group of 3 and a group of 2 .\n\nSecondly, none of the levels pose unique challenges or puzzles - It's all the same paths just recycled and arranged. Even the randomly generated levels are similar, I have played the same randomly generated level twice in one playthrough! These levels are also COMPLETELY LINEAR!\n\nThird, there's only four classes - Of course one can argue this is "based on the original" which only had four classes, but that leaves no reason for not expanding on and improving a working formula. More than one gauntlet game had more than 4 classes, why not bring those back?\nGauntlet 3 had 8 Classes, Gauntlet: The Third Encounter had 8 classes too.\nHell, Legends / Dark Legacy boasted 8 Classes, 8 Beasts, and 1 Secret character + Skins.\n\nFourth, there's also very little customization of said classes, as all growth is in a mandatory tree that grows as you play. Even the wardrobe and custom armours? there's only 3 full sets and a few extras, and all of them require playing on hard or higher to acquire (aside from the usually very ugly first set of unlockable armour).\n\nmastering your character takes longer than beating the game - I finished the game at about 50% Mastery, and this is while consciously trying to actually master the character - I can't imagine how slow playing for fun would be. While this would be fine normally, what's the point in learning these new abilities and bonuses if you've already beaten the hardest obstacle in the game without them? Most of them are passive skills (like damage up +5%) so they don't change gameplay all that much.\n\nFifth, the game (much like Diablo) Expects you to just replay it constantly on higher difficulties to add replay value. And by higher difficulty, I literally mean that all that changes is\nA) how much gold\nB) How many generators there are.\nC) How fast foes come out of them.\nD) How strong these enemies are.\n\nIt doesn't unlock additional side paths or secret stages. No major differences on difficulties.\n\nSixth, Lack of co-op - The game is structured so you need to work together to persevere - Yet,\nyou get constantly rewarded for killing your teammates. It is almost impossible to find good teammates, the game works best if you KNOW you have 3 friends who will consistently play with you - Trustworthy players. While this can't be blamed on the game itself, it really ruins the multiplayer experience if you have bad luck and can't find a good team. Luckily, I bought this for a few buddies as well in the four pack - So I've experienced the good as well.\n\nSeventh, Filled with bugs, glitches, errors, the odd crash, and other "half-finished" giveaways.\n\nAnd finally, keys and potions reset - You literally lose all your keys and potions after every "level" (3 stages per), So stashing Potions and Keys to benefit you later? no point! You can't! But there's enough keys in every level so that you can get every single locked door if you have have a brain, so don't worry - You won't miss a single thing unless you try! It is so linear that you have to consciously TRY to not get everything (Though the only thing you can really collect is Gold anyway!)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI can't say this game wasn't fun at all, but it's literally free-to-play quality.\nIt's not a bad game, but it is THE WORST Gauntlet.\nIt is not worth $19.99, and it is definitely not worth $59.99 for a 4-pack.\n\nIf you wanted a good ol' Gauntlet style experience, I personally recommend you do yourself a huge favor and buy either Gauntlet, Gauntlet II or Gauntlet: Dark Legacy instead, because in my opinion they are all far superior to this rendition of Gauntlet. Considering Dark Legacy is 14 years old, and Gauntlet II and Gauntlet are from the 80's - that's really saying something.\n\nFor what it's worth, it was pretty fun for the short four hours of gameplay we got -\nBut save your money. This is not Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Gauntlet IV, Gauntlet: Legends,\nor Gauntlet: Dark Legacy - This game might as well be called "Rusty Brass Knuckles."\n\nNow, I know this is based on Gauntlet (the original), not Gauntlet: Legends, or Dark Legacy.\nI've played the original gauntlet, and multiple other renditions in the series - Great series, really.\nBut I felt this installment didn't match up to the glory of other previous games, hence: negativity.\nAs someone who has played most of the series (aside from Gauntlet: Third encounter)\nI strongly consider Gauntlet, Gauntlet II, Gauntlet IV, Gauntlet: Legends, and Dark Legacy\n(if I didn't make that obvious enough) much better games than this rendition of Gauntlet.\n(Which - much like Seven Sorrows - is less than four hours, has pretty generic gameplay,)\nand made a promise of old school gauntlet action, then didn't deliver a quality product.)\n\nAs stated above, some people will enjoy this game - But I cannot recommend a 4 hour game,\nfor the price of 20 or 60 dollars. 5 or 10? I would agree. Most Indie games are that cheap,\nand this honestly feels like an indie made game rather than a professional production.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTL;DR\nIf you like short, simple, unoriginal games with literally no replay value that have less than 4 hours of content? Gauntlet is your game! On the other hand, if you like games with at least some replay value, unique items, customization, Challenging puzzles, cool classes, and generally more than just a difficulty change for replayability? Do not get this game! Go play Gauntlet or Gauntlet II - Both of which are also better games than this, and give you the "Real" gauntlet experience. Or if you're not feeling the old games, try Gauntlet: Dark Legacy instead.","September 24, 2014","false","25.4"," 1,263 of 1,528 people (83%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","83","263","1","6","48"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/recommended/258970/","Solinarius","Solinarius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Solinarius/","176 products in account","G:'14 = Gauntlet 2014\nG:SE = Slayer Edition\nAH = Arrowhead\n\nAH was undoubtedly thrilled to apply their mantra to their childhood franchise by quickening the series with a more tactical reboot. They indeed elaborated on the action but did they make a winning formula and is this truly Gauntlet? I'll add that this Gauntlet is as much an arcade game as the first and the hack n' slash gameplay is the best you'll find in the genre.\n\n\nTHE HEROESIf your perspective on nostalgia consists of 4 buddies coming together as Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf and challenging the Gauntlet, you're in for a real treat. AH's expansion to them is very worthy and each possesses nostalgic nods to their original concept. Merlin's spells are an absolute joy to wield and though the others have less to work with, there is elegance in their designs. All are solid and all depend on player skill and improvisation. Suffice it to say, there are no predetermined roles in Gauntlet.\n\nThor - the Warrior\nThor became a confident, unyielding brute and aside from one weapon set, has nothing but all-rounded, close-range attacks. This deceptively makes him appear straight-forward, however, he cannot be played casually. This is due, in part, to the clumsy demeanor of his attacks. Fortunately, he has the greatest vitality, possessing the highest health pool and the most invincibility states.\n\nThyra - the Valkyrie\nThyra became a stoic, battle-hardened shieldmaiden of death. Like Thor, Thyra cannot be played casually, however, she possesses keener attacks--owed to her valkyrian discipline--that allow her to hastily fell the machinations of the Gauntlet. Her shield can ward any attack and it allows her to take defensive postures or guard allies. She, most of all, requires precision. Anything less will leave her open to counter-attack.\n\nMerlin - the Wizard\nMerlin became a wise yet patronizing, mythical grandmaster of magic and is unabashedly the reason I bought Gauntlet, being fit with a miniaturized version of the wizardry from Magicka. He has nine spells in total. Together they give him immense power through versatility. This factor easily and expressly makes Merlin the greatest of the four. Although he is undoubtedly the greatest, presence of mind is required to unleash his phenominal, pseudo-cosmic power.\n\nQuestor - the Elf\nQuestor became an absurd yet graceful arcane bowman. He is straightforward, stylish, and by far the easiest class to play due to his ranged capabilities, subtle magic, and manueverability. Fans of fantasy archer archetypes will definitely appreciate what he brings to the table and he plays how an elven, veritable, twin-stick archer should.\n\n\nSLAYER ADDITIONSForget everything you knew about G:'14 because the gameplay and monsters have been heavily revised. Most importantly, the heroes were expanded upon, particularly the melee classes.\n\nTalismans & Relics\nRelics--magic items which cast an offensive, defensive, or supportive spell--are now tagged with a relevant cooldown and only one may be equipped. My favorite is the Tempest Locket. It unleashes a slow-paced tornado that breaks up even the most densely packed hordes. Talismans are the new equippables, taking the role of effectual potion magic. Tailored to each class, they allow for a totally awesome, welcome expansion to the heroes' personalities. What's more is each class has a modest selection. For instance, Elf's Ultimate Arrow fires a powerful, pervading missile, the Enchanted Willow Branch summons three spirits which orbit him, and Dryad's Song plays a magic melody that heals allies and placates enemies.\n\nUnfortunately, these items are hit or miss. Inquire about them in the community and choose wisely.\n\nWeapons\nWeapon sets now grant each class unique abilities, such as Merlin's Eldritch Sphere which replaces a school with extended lightning magic, or Elf's Shadowstrike which replaces Magic Bomb with Smoke Bomb--a wicked cloak power. Some aren't as obvious in their use, while some are in dire need of AH lovin' to make them more viable. Overall, this change is mind-blowing and I guarantee you'll find some combination of Talisman, Relic, and weapon that thrills you.\n\nThe Bestiary\nIf you're familiar with the original games, you'll recognize at least a few of the throwbacks. G:SE's iteration of the monster roster has bestowed very welcome refinements, particularly to the tougher variety. You may find yourself being under constant threat from Orc Berserkers once they lose their temper, being charged by a Skeleton Defender once you demolish their shield, or dodgeing projectile barrages from Grunt Shamans. There are also some new enemies, such as the enchanted skeleton archer, tougher spiders, and a Temple miniboss.\n\nAH has lain a much tastier variety of monsters to slay but quite a few of the enemies were gutted and a few of the revisions are simply unpalatable (see: cultists). Almost the entire roster lacks appropriate aggressiveness and movement speed on Hard difficulty. This is counteracted by their excessive reach and a very frustrating oversight that allows for stupid-fast melee attacks. Temple enemies are the prime abusers of this. Basically, when you're in Temple levels, all the game's 'fair play' is demized in the fire of a thousand exploding suns.\n\nThe View\nG:SE sports a tethered camera and UGH, is it hideous. One grievance is how adjustments throw off your aim but that's just the beginning! Previously, it was full overhead. Now, it's half isometric and you'll find yourself fighting it as fiercely as your enemies. The camera subjects players to all kinds of nonsense, including death, 'stucktitude', wobbling, and many more! This call to nostalgia enforces cooperative play but the cost is incredibly steep.\n\nThe Content\nThe delightful hub from G:'14 was removed in favor of an artsy but practical map screen. I'm going to miss the ol' hub, but having control over the exact level you play is very convenient and the unwanted interruption to the flow, known as 'run' levels, can be skipped (thank Gaia).\n\nCampaign offers a good experience for newbies and as a side venture, however--by virtue of its difficulty alone--you'll find it unsatisfying if you're an expert. While many encounters (arenas included) were greatly improved, the rest lost some of the magic from G:'14, also, only one boss recieved an upgrade, with the others being castrated. Speaking of arenas, the Colosseum made a return and is on a rotating schedule. One Colosseum map is chosen at random, per day, with a random Summoning Stone affix. Defeating the challenge earns you that day's bonus.\n\nEndless\nThe heart of G:SE. AH has smartly answered the thunderous cries for a worthy procedural mode! Not worthy of the classic games, mind you, because there is a distinct lack of elegant labyrinths in which to wander. Nonetheless, Endless is a welcome addition. Floors consist of the highly linear run levels from G:'14, reconstructed. Sadly, Endless is plagued by some major issues, the greatest of which is the curves that are thrown at you. Sometimes you'll mosey through a pointless, barren level, while other times you'll be treated to the Mini-Battle of Endor. Still, Endless provides a good experience despite its wild difficulty, limited variety, and hacked-together presentation.\n\n\nCONCLUSIONDespite the highly disappointing lack of retro, procedural labyrinths, this is definitely Gauntlet and it boasts superb co-op and gameplay. While it has a semi-solid foundation, there is a mind-numbing amount of frustrating bugs and balance issues, and the game is still considerably content starved. It's a bummer G:SE couldn't be supported further.\n\nUltimately, the action is the juice. Don't bother with G:SE if you can't appreciate that. Otherwise, take up the Gauntlet and INVADE THE DARKNESS!","August 14, 2015","true","836.6"," 212 of 240 people (88%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","88","212","240","12","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/258970/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","Gauntlet is a classic envision of the dungeon crawler game from the atari/nes classic. Introducing a unique take for the classes with the controls, a more modern look and a multiplayer mode which is ridiculously chaotic while keeping true to the original concept of the game. Fans of the original will pick this up and immediately be immersed into a good time with their friends or random individuals online.\n\nRight from the beginning the game will introduce players with some random retro sounds, and music thrown around remixed. Fans of the original gauntlet will immediately be hit by nostalgia. The game lets players choose from two control scheme, The keyboard and mouse scheme or the xbox controller scheme. The controls, however, are not bindable at the moment but does match up to today's control scheme in gaming and works out really well. Those that are new will have to be able to adapt to these controls which aren't hard to learn. The options of the game will have screen size; blood gore; and graphic options and even a retro mode filter which makes the game look like a 8 bit colorized classic look for the game.\n\nThe game lets the player choose four different hero each with their own control scheme style and abilities (referencing to the joy pad).\nThe Warrior Thor  with the ability to spin attack enemies and rush/charge them  able to tatically enter the fray of battle\nThe Valkarie Thyra is the defender of the team, with the ability to shield wall block and toss the shield at multiple enemies.\nThe Elf Questor is the agility of the team that can roll quickly and dodge from attacks while dropping mines and using focused ranged attacks to back the team in a distance.\nThe Wizard Merlin is the complex of the classes. By using three distinct elements and a combination of two spell press each. He can cast a variety of different spells. Varying From shielding spells to projectile damage and crowd controlling spells\n\nEach of these four classes adds a unique play to the table as players traverse the dungeons. There will be four difficulties of game play. Options are Easy, Normal, Hard and Insane. There are a variety of kill challenges that players will have to complete while playing the game to earn a buff perk called masteries on their class in order to survive the difficulties. There are also some relic items' players can buy from the shop after earning enough gold in the game to carry to add more variety of skill to aid them in the harder difficulty along with some aesthetic load outs.\n\nThe game play with coop is quite simple. As the team moves along the map moves along with the team though  players can, however, can get stuck into a corner if other players hug the opposite side and stay too far. There will be many things going on at once on the screen so some players might have to adjust to seeing the intense amount of action on the screen and keep an eye on their character otherwise losing sight of the character and dying will cost the team a coin which is the shared life the team uses. If all coins are diminished it is the game over, and the entire team will have to start from the beginning, however, coins can be replenished by attacking enemy summon portals. To win the stage players will destroy enemies, take down portals, discover secret with keys and open doors and reach the doorway to escape. Spamming buttons and shooting randomly at everything are also not advised because the only way to heal in the game is to eat food items and by doing so will accidentally destroy the holy chicken and potions.\nAt the end of each stage player will be rated on the gold collected along with the amount of kills and the one who performs above all will be crowned king. There are also only three bosses in the game and three different stages with 4-5 levels each, which can take anywhere from 15-30 minutes to complete depending on difficulty and skill levels.\n\nPlayers can play this game by themselves. However, it is highly recommended as a coop game, therefore, multiplayer is must especially since there will be all types of variety of undead and monsters to fight. From enemies that explode and damage all others or those that spawn from portals to shoot projectiles. Only with the help of friends and others will players conquer the gauntlet and reign supreme.\n\nAs for my opinion about the game to be honest? This game is ridiculously fun with friends and random players alike. It's a fresh look on a classic game while staying true to it is what more can I say. Online has been flawless so far with a few problems on connections. The game has some technical issue such as unbindable keys at the moment and reading the game from window language or detecting resolution. Those are issues that should be taken to the forums and not about the game in terms of review. And hard + insane mode is ridiculous. As in you'll die when the action gets intense, and you'll die many times. The game has some technical issue such as unbindable keys at the time and reading the game from window language or detecting resolution. Those are issues that should be taken to the forums and not about the game in terms of review.

It has no issues or bugs that I have experienced. I have only played a little bit on my own most of my time spent in game was co-op with my wife. For me the entire reason to even play Gauntlet is to do it co-op. In co-op even though you are working together to complete the level there is also a bit of competiton. You strive to get highest kills, most gold, and also to obtain and keep the golden crown which flies off every time you take damage(and I mean flies off, sometimes across the screen). Each character has a unique and individual feel to their combat and attacks. My only regret is that it's not longer(beat the game in about 7 hours). However replay value comes into play with completing different difficulties and experiencing the combat and skills of the other characters. I definetly see myself playing through the game two to three more times.\nI don't regret spending $20 on this but %50 off would make it about right I think.\n\nOh and I could probably live longer and complete the levels with more ease if my wife didn't love being the archer, shooting every piece of food that shows up, stealing all the gold, and using all the revive tokens!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skraticus/recommended/258970/","Skraticus","Skrat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skraticus/","196 products in account","The Quick Review\n\n\nA very short and a not too awfully fun game. If it's on sale for about 80% percent off, then I might recommend it if you have some friends that would want to crank up the difficulty and have a few beers a couple of nights.\n\nSome quick negatives:\n- it is extremely short\n- not much character selection\n- you can't unlock the "hidden" character, you have to buy him with real money....\n- extremely repetitive. Levels were made with much copy and paste\n\n\nThe Report\n\n\nMy wife is a huge Gauntlet fan. The old school Gauntlet on Nintendo 64 was once of her favorite games, so naturally we grabbed this as soon as it went on sale. As soon as I loaded the game and was looking at the few choices presented for character selection,  I noticed at the bottom of the list the Necromancer character with a lock over his name. My first thought was "cool, you probably get him after beating the game or something."\nThat's what I had hoped anyway. Then the more seasoned side of my brain said "wait a minute, this is 2014. I bet you have to buy it." Quick Google search later and yes, you have to pay to unlock the "hidden" character. For me, this was an instant down vote with very little hope of being saved.\n\nThen we started playing... The only character that is really worth anything is the Valkyrie. She has everything:\n\n- A ranged move, which is throwing her shield. Small cool down\n- A shield to defend with\n- Sword for up close quick attacks that deal good damage\n- A spear she can use to charge through hordes with. Insta-killing most\n\nSo what does the warrior get? An axe and a low IQ, which is humorous at times but gets old rather quickly. He can swing … and swing. No defense whatsoever. You do get some perks to help later, but still, it's very annoying to just be able to run in with no defense options.\n\nThe archer? A bow that does little to no damage, and a bomb. The bomb is useful, but your friends will probably kill everything before it goes off anyway.\n\nThe wizard? Believe it or not he's not bad. He can mix and match up to nine spells, which does make playing him pretty entertaining. But there is something about him that just doesn't make you want to keep using him. The spells get a little boring after a while, and a couple of them could really use some tweaking.\n\nKeep in mind the above mention of the wizard is just my opinion. He can be a good character to use if you adjust yourself to his playstyle. The warrior and archer, however, are seriously lacking some needed adjustments.\n\nAll that  being said, you'd expect to find everybody running around with either a Valkyrie or Wizard, right? Well, two people can't play the same character, so two of your friends are going to soon not be your friends.\n\n\nAs for the rest of the game? Short and repetitive. It's really sad how short this game is considering how many times they just copy and pasted when making the levels. Even some of the bosses are duplicates, just with different models. The first set of levels is alright, but once you've done those four, you've seen all this game has to offer. There were honestly moments when we were playing that I thought I had picked the same level again, or we had messed up and it was making us redo a floor for some reason. They were that similar.\n\nMy final opinion of this game:\nJust another cheap rip off that was crapped out by another gaming company that is no longer interested in making a good game. They too have fallen into the get rich quick schemes and make more for less. Finished product?

That said, people new to the gauntlet series can also find a lot of love for this game. This game takes gauntlet back to it's arcade roots with a few modern twists.\n\nIf you're new to the series, A breif overview:\nGauntlet is  a cooperative top down beat/shoot/magic/death them up game where you and up to three friends traverse increasingly deadly areas searching for gold through death bringing traps and hordes of enemies in an effort to complete the Gauntlet and earn power and riches beyond imagination.\n\nIf you're one of the people who only cares for gameplay, prepare for a treat. Gauntlet brings back the main 4 characters from the previous games, who have each been amped up beyond what abilities they had previously been seen with:\n\nFirst comes the warrior - Rough, Tough, Break Through & Beat em up. Two handing an axe allows the warrior a wide melee swing and devestating damage. He can also preform a spin attack, cleaving enemies all around him. Great for taking on those hordes of skeletons who just can't seem to leave you alone.\n\nNext is the Valkyrie - Strong, Agile, and willing to take any measure to get her revenge. The Valkyrie uses a spear and a shield, able to dash through enemies while blocking her opponent's attaks. She can throw her shield Captain America style with her special and oh is it a devestating move.\n\nThrid comes the Elf - Long Range and Quick as the wind. The Elf is an archer who can utilize rapid fire arrows, precice piercing shots, and even small bombs he can place at his feet. And if enemies start to encroach he comes prepped with a dodge role to quickly reposition and wreak havoc on his foes.\n\nLastle comes the Wizard - Spells, Spells, and more Spells. The character to see the greatest update from their old age counterpart, the wizard now has access to 9 different methods of attack. From chain lightning to freezing orbs to massive fireballs to electricity bubbles, the wizard finds himself the most versatile of the 4 heroes, although he is the weakest in HP.\n\nThe game plays just like the classics, with a multitude of enemies and chain attacks that leave you feeling like a total badass. This game is enjoyed far more with friends, though single player can be a great challenge if you're feeling brave.\n\nThe game is not without some slight negatives. It lacks the possibility of changing your character color (to my knowlege) as seen in the Dark Legacy iteration of Gauntlet, leaving me without the possiblility to play as my classic red elf. (warrior is set to red, valkyrie to blue, elf to green, and wizard to yellow) The potions that used to be screen nukes or destroy death have been removed, replaced with artifacts that you can purcahse with your gold in game (no microtransactions as of yet - and never i hope) that grant temporary boosts to stats. While a nice twist I just can't get past them removing one of the most iconic abilites in Gauntlet.\n\nOverall, this game is a gem, and definatly worth the asking price. Whether a fan of the series or not, you can find good fun in this game. If you're unsure if you want to purchase it, know that it is a game aht is a lot more fun to play than watch.\n\nGood luck in the Gauntlet. and please....

Not 40 yet though ...\n\nIn short the original was awesome. I remember it taking an age to load (on the speccy) and then spending HOURS with my best mate killing ghosts, skeletons etc. etc.\n\nThe reboot definitely lives up to the playability of the original, though times have changed. I'm running it on a machine that makes my 128k speccy look like the first wheel and my partner in rendering 'bum kicking destruction' is my good lady wife.\n\nTo be honest, we're not that far in to the game, having only completed the first two scenarios but we've experienced, in no particular order; edge of the seat tension (thanks Death!), tactical analysis, acute tactical deficiencies, where the hell is the next chicken dinner?, smoke breaks, dying (a lot), spamming the B button to do Thor's whirly thing, shouting, heatedly debating, the children, halfway through play, spilling juice all over their bedroom and an EPIC amount of GOLD. This is what a game should be all about :)\n\nBeing a Diablo III player I thought that this would be the usual kinda romp through a dungeon with no particular level of difficulty, however, I was totally wrong. This game is hard - playing it solo on normal with Thor will get you killed fairly quickly. Like other games of yesteryear you had to learn them especially when soloing, so I was pretty chuffed when the missus stopped on WoW and decided to have a bash. Better. Much Better.\n\nYou really get the benefit of the differing abilities of the characers when you play as a team. We were playing as Thor & Questor (Tank & Damage respectively) and were pretty effective at knocking out the generators/portals or whatever you want to call them.\n\nHard on two player, No. Challenging, Yes. but that doesn't mean it's not FUN. I've thorougly enoyed the last 3 hours of play and if it wasn't for my eyes about to dry out, I'd probably be on it for a few more tonight.\n\nBy comparison Diablo is a bit of a cake walk, if you really want something to get your teeth into, then give this a go, I double dares ya!!!\n\nP.S. I bought the 4 pack which I think is really good value for money.

I'm so happy to say that the team behind this version has done a sterling job.  This is the best hack-and-slash dungeon crawler that I know of.\n\nThe five characters (one character is in purchaseable DLC) have just enough different moves, which are fun in their executions to keep the game from feeling mundane.  Each character that you play with does make you feel like the hero!  You get the chance to demolish large hordes of monsters, which either clear the way or save your team mates from taking hits (or dying!).\n\nThe co-op is fantastic.  As is mostly the case, the more the merrier.  Currently finding online players is no problem, there seems to be a healthy playerbase at the moment.  Let's hope it holds for the future.\n\nThe graphics artists have done a good job on the in game graphics.  The characters on the select screen look a bit blocky, but doesn't effect anything important!\n\nYou can alter the abilities of your character by collecting gold in the game, speed ups, different special moves, magic, etc.\n\nThe devs implemented quite a big update recently which frustrated some of the community, this is the reason for such a large number of unwarranted negative reviews.  Sadly with patches that change many things in a game, some will see it as progress and some will feel alienated.

In fact, it's probably closer to the classic "Smash TV" in gameplay - which is not bad, per se, but it doesn't resemble Gauntlet much.\n\nMost of the classic gameplay elements are there, but some have been meddled with while others are  notorious by their absence. The characters play far differently now - to be completely different from the arcade original. The warror and valkyrie can't shoot, and the wizard has a bunch of spells which can be selected by confusing street-fighter-like button combinations. Also the way magic works in game is not like the original, owing to a  relic system that lets you buy types of magic for in-game gold. The enemy generators are fewer but now take excessive hits to damage. Death is more of a nuisance than he ever was, and now ALL the food is vulnerable to being shot.\n\nAs for level design, the rooms are rather too large and you can avoid most of the nasties by running in circles. It's not very claustrophobic and Gauntlet-like at all. Also granted that the game likes to lock you in arena battles is where this game borrows more closely from Smash TV than Gauntlet.\nThe inclusion of the crown is a welcome addition (like classic Gauntlet II's "it" creature), as are the exploding barrels. Some of the other room elements (moving blocks, lava cranks) don't add much to the game at all and just get in the way of the fun.\n\nI understand the desire to update an old game, but sometimes going crazy and introducing a bunch of cool new things that don't really work together can really imbalance the fundamental gameplay, and that's what's happened here. As it stands as a game in it's own right, it's certainly fun during multiplayer -- if you can bear being the slow old wizard while everyone grabs the gold before you do. Also the boss fights are a bit of a let down... I had to figure out how to kill the first one, and having to solve room puzzles isn't really what Gauntlet is supposed to be about. Just let me hack'n'slash them, thanks.\n\nMy fear is that the game will not have much lasting appeal - save for those who love grinders. There are not so many levels and there are no infinitely generated ones like the arcade game. It's just going to become a grindfest for masteries, new character clothes and relics pretty quickly. To top it off, the character speech in-game gets really REALLY repetitive, and the score leaderboards have been plauged by cheats.\n\nIt's not a bad game,... in fact it's fun for a while, and will grow on you if you give it a chance .... but it's just not a great game.","October 6, 2014","false","30.3"," 116 of 164 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","116","164","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/recommended/258970/","aussiedroid","Aussiedroid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aussiedroid/","744 products in account","The original Gauntlet from 1985 was one of those genre defining games, that was not only one of the first really fun co-op games I ever played, but also was the predecessor to many classic dungeon crawlers we know today like Diablo, Sacred, Path of Exile, Magicka, Baldur's Gate, Dungeon Defenders or even instance dungeons of World of Warcraft. Spawning a classic sequel & several modern remakes on the consoles, Gauntlet has endured the decades, although the modern 3D versions failed to capture the feel from the originals for me. So here we are in 2014 with another remake, one making the bold claim to the title, simply 'Gauntlet', has a lot to live up to!\n\nFor those familiar with the original games, first time you start you will be hit with a good dose of nostalgia. Retro sounds from the original are remixed into the modern music & effects, the logo & look all feels familiar but fresh. Great sound really sets the scene & gets you pumped! I liked the graphics look & the lighting, not super HD but clean and easy to see what is going on. Monster designs were also well done.\n\nAll the trademark Gauntlet features you expect are included, ranging from the 4 well defined character classes, the puzzle like mazing map designs, lotsa gold!, keys, turkeys (& friends to steal them :p), potions, jump platforms, spawners, grim reaper & the awesome narrator telling the classics like “Warrior needs food .. badly!” & “Wizard is about to die!”. All this feels authentic & refined, honouring the originals faithfully, but there is also many new features & enhancements.\n\nBesides the obvious move into 3D, all the characters have got new moves & upgrades. Each has 3 attack types, plus ability for 2 Relics (basically power-moves), each using unique controller configurations. You can combine your attacks in different ways, & also with other classes based on the situation. Most moves have both strengths & weaknesses so the right selection (plus aiming & timing) is key to survival.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=318842086 Basic character class are as follows:\n\n* Warrior (Thor) is great in mowing down large groups, although weaker against ranged, hard to excel at but tough overall.\n\n* Valkyrie (Thyra) is good defender with shield, also versatile & powerful offensive moves, but weak destroying spawners.\n\n* Elf (Questor) is fast & nimble able to attack from almost any range, good AoE bomb damage for groups but needs space to operate effectively.\n\n* Wizard (Merlin) is the most complex, yet highly adaptable class, with 9 spell combinations both offensive & defensive, it can be seen as over-powered but requires a lot more skill to play.\n\n(There is more to each class but it gives you a rough outline.)\n\nAdapting to the battle is fluid & fun to control though & when mastered, combat can become epic! The combat control system is simple by many modern game standards, but it’s really exceptionally balanced, intuitive & accessible – one of the strongest features of the game!\n\nEach character class independently can gain 72 Mastery Levels (XP levels) which will unlock perks & upgrades to progress further on the Hard or Unfair difficulty. Each difficulty level needs to be unlocked for each character & higher levels do offer a really intense challenge. This adds a lot of replayability as does the many in-game ‘grindy’ achievements you can earn at the end of each level that give you buffs or boosts. There are some cosmetic items you can purchase for the coins you earn in the dungeons, to change the look of your character. There aren’t very many though. Likewise, there are some (few more) Relics, but overall there isn’t a lot of selections for those wanting high level of customisation.\n\nDespite all the positive design choices, the authentic feel & just plain enjoyable co-op gameplay, Gauntlet has one fatal flaw … the lack of content, specifically the number of dungeon levels.\n\nThere is 3 zones each with 4 dungeons, some multiple levels, but overall only 30ish levels in total. This includes 3 boss arenas that have no exploration. This will only take 4-5hrs to play through Solo @ Normal. The original Gauntlet I/II had 100s of levels (if memory serves), practically endless random dungeons to conquer. See how far you could survive with your buddies, but you just don't get that feeling here.\n\nReplaying levels for each character & difficulty level is fine, but with so few levels I have already started to memorise the layouts. I fear this lack of variety will make this a short lived experience with many gamers, when I could have seen it be my go-to favourite game for a while.  I really hope to see lots of new dungeons or at the least support for community workshop maps or a random generated endless mode (100s of increasingly difficulty & larger dungeons) to provide a real hardcore on-going challenge to work with your friends towards. More items, perks, customised looks would all be welcome too!\n\nAlthough I agree with having no chat in the game, having text chat in the lobby &/or hub would be most helpful. Currently, there is no way to communicate at all with other team mates if not in your friends’ list. Also, it is very limiting in public games when players cannot join in mid-level, you can only join when in a lobby – but who wants to wait in a lobby for that elusive 4th player to drop in, or to go back to lobby every time to find another player when someone drops mid-level? It’s not a smooth experience & comes off as rather basic, along with making it very hard to get a full team together. Matchmaking does seem to work well at least.\n\nPlaying with friends is an absolute blast & with so much else done right the limited content can be ignored (for a while) along with the online multiplayer limitations I mentioned above. It's a supremely enjoyable experience. Whether you have played the originals or not, this is a solid action dungeon crawler that succeeds in recreating that uniquely 'Gauntlet’ experience.\n\nFind some friends & have some fun! Dibbs on Valkyrie .. and … No destroying the food! :)\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","September 27, 2014","true","107.6"," 101 of 141 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","101","141","0","10"

Needless to say, I approached with optimism.\n\nI played the hell out of Gauntlet Legends way back on my N64 with my brother and sister, as well as some of Dark Legacy. Although this game has upgrades you can buy ("relics", kind of like constant passives) and a small amount of persistence, there's a lot that doesn't work in this iteration of a classic.\n\n-This game is short.\n\n-The bosses are easy.\n\n-Teamwork is non-existent in most PUG scenarios (and anti-team actions are even actively encouraged).\n\n-The latter fire/hell-themed dungeons are depressingly boring and empty; devoid of even minor details.\n\n-There's literally nothing to unlock as you progress except for ugly skull-obsessed cosmetics and minor passives: no new hero classes (jester?) or full reskins (like the minotaur from Legends, for instance)... not even the ability to change your colour. Maybe a skull helm though; well done, hero.\n\n-DID I MENTION THE SKULLS-ON-CLOTHES THING??\n\nMy biggest gripe though: there is literally no reason this game had to strip out the numerous advancements of the formula established in Dark Legacy and Legends. Those were damned good games (but nostalgia may be strong with this one), and in their place we get a shallow experience wearing the skin and spinning the axe of Gauntlets of yesteryear. It had some potential but feels like the ball was dropped.\n\nTL;DR: It's still a decent arcadey chop-em-up, but I'm left feeling like I got (another) half-finished Kickstarter project which promised big and delivered nothing. Legends and Dark Legacy moved the formula forward, to great success. This one has moved the ball back to the 50-yard line for no conceivable reason. I can't figure out what the idea was, here. If it was intended to be most like the old Gauntlets, why don't you constantly lose health? Make up your mind!\n\nEDIT: You can get new characters... in DLC! Frabjous day!\n\nEDIT 2: I should note that some dude got mad about my review, saying "it was supposed to be like the first Gauntlet", as if that somehow excuses it from being boring or feeling barebones. If it could be better, then it could be rated down, period. I'll use this as an example: a bunch of my friends own it, and I have the most time in the game, by at least a dozen hours.

Linear's not a bad thing in games, but in this instance it takes an already simple game and points you forward. With limited character attacks that soon become repetitive, and only the illusion of character skill trees/progression, it all adds up to you thinking you could spend your time better elsewhere.\n\nThe levels are split into 3 sets of 4, with each of those 3 sets having it's own theme. One of those themes is mostly dark caves where the only light source is a slight glow around your character, which doesn't really add to the atmosphere, it just makes it annoying to navigate. Each themed set is also very samey.. I think they've been a bit lazy and could have not only put ALOT more levels in, but also more variety. Kinda feels like a tablet game in that respect.\n\nOn the plus side, it's a bit of fun with friends, especially with the difficulty up when in rooms where you get swarmed, but unfortunately it mostly lacks any real frantic play.\n\nIf you like working on Achievements, you'll find a third of the achievements are for playing very badly, another third for progress, and the last third for playing way more than you really want to.\n\nI'd give the game a neutral rating if I could, but in honesty I don't think it has enough to recommend it.. seems like development was a bit lazy, although it's not buggy or anything.. just design choices really.","October 31, 2014","false","10.8"," 69 of 93 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","69","93","0","0"

On the other hand, this game is not the Gauntlet you probably know and love. The whole new character design thing is lame, Gauntlet didn't need that type of gameplay.\n\nThen theres the part where there really aren't any items because you get these sort of bonus skills (which are the only thing you use gold for) which are activated by potions (which is the only thing you use potions for).

There was a lot of excitement and anticipation in all of us since we all remember playing earlier versions of Gauntlet.\n\nWe played the first world and we were all enjoying it very much.  "The warrior needs food." "The wizard shot the food." It was great. But we then began playing the second world and then the third.  It was all very much the same.  There was little creativity in the theme.  I understand that level design can be challenging but each world followed the same pattern.  First stage introduces you to the world and some theme on this world.  Second stage you run from Death.  Third stage has some kind of boss fight at the end.  Fourth stage is pure boss battle.\n\nI don't regret the purchase since we have played a lot and will continue on higher difficulty but I would say wait for a sale.","December 18, 2014","true","11.9"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","41","50","0","0"

The endless dungeon is a nice addition as well.. delving deeper and deeper each time to see how far you can get... honestly not a mode for everyone but at least its there.

With the promise of the classic Gauntlet experience, as a remastered reboot, I came in with glinting eyes and an eager smile. The first levels I greatly enjoyed, especially playing in a group of 4. Unfortunately, I started to notice something sinister as the time went by. The level design, the enemy design, the bosses....it's all so lazy! the entire game follows the same formula. There is almost no deviation from this, and the exploration factor is zero. Using keys in smart manner is absent, the enemy variety is disappointly scarce, featuring what basically amounts to recolors of the same enemies: melee gore fodder, slightly tougher ranged casters, and brutes, along with minibosses. The lich I found to be pretty interesting, featuring a couple of neat attacks. Beyond that, the game had a gross blandness you normally need unsalted crackers to experience. Class design is horribly tilted, with Valkyrie having the ability to block, Warrior being a warrior, Elf being useless (seriously, his attacks cannot damage spawners--who made this decision?), and the ripoff Magicka Wizard (why is the wizard given 9 spells, in a hack and slash game, and then make only 2 of them do meaningful damage?). The game falls flat at a meager 3-4 hours, with no real incentive to keep replaying. The new relic system replaced the potions that we remember. These relics cost gold, and use a potion to cast. They range from making enemies not attack you to making enemies not attack you. And then, as a slap to the face, you can't gain any potions to use during boss encounters. Wtf? Why give us this illusion of progression? And the actual gear and DLC incentives are cosmetic only. Dropping 36,000 gold nets you a different colored cape! nice! There is a mastery system, but to get noticeable effects, you have to grind so hard (dying gives you bonuses to reduce your ability to die.... you're rewarded for bad play). All in all, this isn't the reboot we wanted, you're better off looking for a PS2 copy of Gauntlet Dark Legacy or even the original Gauntlet (stay away from that horrible mistake God of Wa-- I mean, Seven Sorrows). To its credit, it is not the worst thing I've ever played. It works well, isn't buggy, the netcode felt sound, and you might even get some giggles out of a 4 player co-op session. This game is just bland and felt lazy and uninspired the whole way through. But at least you can still shoot the food.","September 23, 2014","false","4.3"," 317 of 516 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","317","516","0","19"

This game is much more challenging and expect failure at first on higher difficulties.  This game is designed with team coordination in mind.  At Normal or Easy difficulties, the game is easy once you get the hang of it.  But at Hard and Unfair, it becomes very challenging to play solo or with an uncoordinated team members since you have limited lives.  This game is best played with friends or other people.  Though it is doable even on Unfair difficulty, I would not recommend playing this game solo.\n\nThere seems to be some imbalance amongst the classes.  Archer and Wizard are arguable the most reliable classes on Hard or Unfair difficulty due to their ability to kite.  Valkyrie would be a close third with his overpowered spammable lance thrust and shield block.  And Warrior is definitely the runt of the liter due to damage and survivability issues.\n\nWarrior offers the least overall damage and the most difficulty avoiding damage while in combat.  His weak attack is appalling and his strong attack is comparable to the Valkyrie's while being slower and having a smaller area of effect.  The only redeemable quality about the Warrior is he unlocks a low-hp regeneration perk and he has the simplest control design.\n\nWizard has the most complex kit design requiring 2 button combinations between 3 buttons to determine your spell cast.  (XX, XY, XA, YY, YX, YA, AA, AX, AY).  They offer a lot of utility, have comparable sustained damage and a decent kit to kite once you get used to switching spells on the fly, and unlock a shield that blocks damage after 16-20 seconds of being untouched.  Wizard has essentially no burst but plenty of ways to dish out damage over time.\n\nArcher is in my opinion the easiest to use with high burst damage from his bombs, low sustained damage, and a nice roll dodge; just imagine playing a MMO and mobbing monsters.\n\nValkyrie like I mentioned earlier has a ridiculously power strong attack which offers high amounts of sustained damage; the tradeoff is he's vulnerable to getting hit if he just spams the attack.  The Valkyrie unlocks a powerful perk which makes him very durable at low health.\n\nThe leveling and gold system definitely seems a bit bland.  You can buy relics which are temporary perks you can use with potions and new gear but the gear is purely aesthetic.  I do find it interesting that you "level up" by unlocking achievements (eg. killing 10,000 monsters, breaking 500 props, etc) which will give you various benefits.  It seems kind of silly that you unlock some perks for dying.  Some perks have 3 tiers, Bronze Silver and Gold.  Each is just a slight upgrade over the previous perk.  The time it takes max out all the perks is at least 30 hours on a single class.\n\nI would estimate the average playtime will be around 20-40 hours for a person who enjoys this game.  After 40 hours of personal gametime, I would say the game is definitely better played with friends.  Though public rooms are available, the experience is nowhere as fun.  My biggest concern is that the game will lose replayability once you become better at it and master every level on Unfair difficulty since there is a limited amount of actual content (you can speed run through everything on Easy in probably 2 to 4 hours).\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 7 out of 10.  I would say the game's good, but not great, and very fun while chatting with friends over voip.","October 7, 2014","true","44.8"," 53 of 73 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","53","73","0","0"

It is not item / equipment intensive (no matter how much some players will complain), nor is it a game that currently contains plenty of end-game material - and NO, this does not give you the right to complain endlessly when you realise this.\nIf you are looking for these sorts of games - then you can play a game like Diablo or Path of Exile, because chances are; you will not be able to enjoy this game or understand the uniqueness that it presents.\n\nSo what sort of people would enjoy this game? 'Completionists', classic gamers, players who have a group of friends and want to enjoy a co-operative game together (re-experience the 'old days' where gamers would sit together and play on a console), players that have played the Gauntlet gameline since the very beginning, fans of 'Dungeon Crawlers' - the list goes on and on.\nIt is a game that immerses itself within local competitiveness (just like those times when you would battle your friends in Super Smash Brothers) as well as giving you a darker theme (for the glory of adult themes).\n\nTruely a game that can unleash a multitude of emotions.\n\nDo I recommend this game? Yes\nShould you buy this game? Yes\nWould you enjoy this game more with friends?

Mostly because I like the mindless monster killing. But at the same time this game has so many positive reviews that are based on content that is no longer in the game since the release of the 2.0 patch. Great things like the Hub were removed, necromancer was nerfed into the ground (more like 10 feet into the ground), and all the work that everyone did in 1.0 to unlock character masteries was rendered completely pointless now. Now everything is purchased with just base gold. All skills, abilities, trinkets blah blah all gold. AMAZING passives from masteries were just wiped from the game. 1.0 gauntlet had plenty of fun things to work for by grinding the levels. Now in 2.0 gauntlet you can do endless for an hour or two and deck out a character with whatever weapon and ability you want. I do not recommend the game in its current state. If it's on sale and you have friends who want to play I would give it a 2 hour test run and refund if you find it distasteful like I do in its current form. What annoys me the most is that even though they patched out all this stuff this game still has a large majority of positive reviews...

For each successful reboot (take the new Tomb Raider for example) there are more often than not a host of clunkers. Conker Locked and Reloaded, Golden Axe - Beast Rider, Shadowrun the RPG that morphed into a terrible multiplayer FPS and the Bomberman reboot are just some of the failures that failed to capture the imagination and the magic in the same way the originals did. Where Gauntlet manages to fit into all of this depends on how rosey those nostalgia-tinted glasses of yours have become. Gauntlet has seen its fair share of reincarnations over the years since the classic 4 player co-op arcade game debuted in 1985 with not all of them being entirely successful at achieving what they set out to do.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=320284128\nThis latest incarnation by Arrowhead Game Studios , the guys that already made another Gauntlet type game called Magika, are on hand to give us a modern day remake of the original arcade classic giving players the chance to revisit the spoils of the often fettered and restrictive dungeons from the original as hoard's of fantasy-based monsters swarm your character in ever increasing numbers the further down the line you progress. As a modern day game, Gauntlet may appear almost archaic to the gamer who has little or no connection to the series. There are no RPG builds here to tinker with as each character from Thor the Warrior, Merlin the Wizard, Thyra the Valkyrie, or Questor the Elf each have their own unique strength and weaknesses. The player is given no option, just like the original, to play mix and match with their character builds.\n\nSome things have been tinkered with and changed for a modern day audience. In the original, if any of the players died they could immediately insert another coin to rejoin their friends in the adventure. This allowed players to continue on provided they had enough coins in their purse. In the remake the party is started off with five skull coins which any player can use should they meet their end. More coins are slowly built up through a progress bar onscreen which does mean all parties playing together need to be a bit more tactical and keep an eye on each others health since this sharing of coins can often have the unintended effect of having your weakest player consume all the coins thereby ending the games playthrough. The original Gauntlet featured no bosses but since boss-battles have become such a staple of the RPG cannon in recent years the three bosses that bookend each of the three short chapters can often be grueling and tough fights as enemies are spawned to aid the particular boss in battle.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=320284128\nLike the original some things do make a welcome return. One of these being the sharing of food. Food increases health for the wounded but also increases the health bar of the unaffected provided they collect a certain amount of it. Like the original, depending on the willingness of the players to co-operate by sharing food and luring monsters into places where they can be engaged and slaughtered more conveniently will greatly enhance your parties chances of success. If you have a stubborn player on board who is there to "troll the food" you may be in for a bit of a rough ride (although there is an option to kick the player from the game provided you are the host). Once again it is possible like in the original to accidentally damage the food available in each level so that no one can consume it (thanks to one of Questor's, Valkyrie's, Merlin's or Thor's rouge arrow, shield, fireball or spin-attack's) which can have the drastic effect of changing the tides very quickly on the more harder difficulty settings. Death, and its icy grasp, also makes an appearance and while practically impossible to kill is best avoided by staying out of his radius (a blue haze that emanates outwards) as coming into direct contact with this will result in instant death. The original Gauntlet is also noted for its narrator so it was great to see him make a comeback with most of his original quips intact such as "Remember, don't shoot the food!", "Elf – shot the food!", and "Warrior needs food – badly!"\n\nGauntlet is an incredibly short adventure but given its current price that argument does become rather moot. Three chapters with four acts that take no more than 45 minutes to clear should see most parties finishing the game in just under five hours. One can progress further on with the party by simply upping the difficulty level to the next tier. If I have some complaints it's that there is very little enemy variety on display during each chapter and until that chapter closes and you move onto the next you will be fighting spawns of the same enemy over and over again. Also the games camera is drawn so far out of the action that during some 4 player co-op mayhem it becomes very difficult to distinguish what the hell is going on when the screen is literally swamped with enemies because everything appears so tiny. Graphically Gauntlet is rather underwhelming relying yet again on many of the genres environmental tropes such as musty cavernous trap-riddled tombs or fiery lava pits of fire and brimstone. Nothing here that you would have not already seen countless times if you are a fan of the Diablo series. My major gripe with the game is probably the multiplayer lobby, which must filled with all four players, if you want the full experience. There is no drop-in, drop-out functionality here and often you can create a game in the lobby and wait eons for other interested parties to join you provided you haven't already sent out invites to play to your friends.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=320218989\nGauntlet is a simple hack and slash fantasy game that would be pretty much unremarkable if it were not for its 4 player co-op. As a single player game it's a bit of a tiresome chore (even with its short length) but add three friends into the mix and it can often be blast to play. Gauntlet doesn't redefine the way we play co-op games but it does ensure those who tag along for its incredibly short ride - do have some element of fun!\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","October 1, 2014","true","9.3"," 66 of 98 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","66","98","0","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/258970/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Gauntlet is a top down dungeon crawler game that was developed by Arrowhead Game Studios and published by Warner Brothers. Gauntlet was released in September 2014, and was later ported to the PS4 in August 2015.\n\nYou take the role of one of four classes of heroes. Each hero has their own unique play style and special abilities. Personally I played the game primarily as the archer, because I just find the range classes more fun to play, but there are warriors and mages included here too. Your character has a regular attack, a special attack and a more situational ability too. The special attack and special ability all change when you upgrade your weapon. You may find that certain weapons/abilities are more suited for certain levels as well. The gameplay reminded me very much of a Diablo style, in that I was actually able to just hold down my left mouse button which is the regular attack and not let go as enemies just surround you most of the time - your other abilities come with a cooldown so you need to time these for when they are going to be most beneficial.  The aim on each of the levels is to reach the end of the stage - there aren't any side quests on any of the stages, it’s purely a dungeon crawler. Throughout each of the levels, you will come across piles and piles of gold. The gold is used in the lobby screen before each level to purchase upgrades, whether it be new weapons, new skins for your character, new relics or new special abilities, and they cost a lot of gold too, so it's a good thing you will come across abundance amount of gold in this game.\n\nThe graphics in Gauntlet are OK - they aren't anything special, but they certainly aren't bad by any stretch. The lighting on the darker levels is something I found to be really well done though - you get a sense of being really deep underground and with the helpless lost feeling as you are crawling through empty dark hallways and caves. The lava levels are really pretty too and some of my favourite stages in the game are because of their aesthetic.\n\nGauntlet is fully voice acted, each of the four heroes has their own individual voice actor; all be it the elf archer can wear very thin on you at times. The narration is done very well too, as it guides you through the plentiful stages on what is happening and keeping the plot going.\n\nWe see three levels of difficulty in Gauntlet, Easy, Medium and Hard - easy mode is VERY easy. You should only be playing that if you want to blast through the game for special achievements or just for completion sake. You could also be playing easy if you want to learn a new class. The downside to playing on easy is that you get less gold from drops though - so it is kind of swings and round-a-bouts. The medium difficulty is where you should be spending a lot of your time - this is where you will get a regular amount of gold, and the enemies will be sufficiently challenging. Hard mode should only really be played if you are planning on playing with friends who have a lot of experience in the game, or you have built up a ton of upgrades allowing you to min/max your way through the stages as efficiently as possible.\n\nI touched on playing friends briefly above, Gauntlet is able to be played in a four player co-op environment, each player takes control of one of the four classes and you play the game as a team. The enemies are all scaled up depending on how many people are playing - most people will say that co-op is the only mode you should be playing Gauntlet - whilst I may say that will be true, it is certainly not wise to be playing with PUGs (pick up groups from quick queues). If you do want the multiplayer experience in Gauntlet, then play it with friends and get on Skype together, it will make the entire experience so much more fun and will definitely make it a better play through as opposed to playing with randommers or on your own.\n\nEach of the numerous levels in Gauntlet all have a main dungeon design to them, but a lot of the stages are also procedurally generated, allowing for some stages leaving you lost in the deep depths of caves and forcing you to explore around in order to find the exits. Others which are more objective based, whether it be lowering a gate, or finding keys to open a door, will be more or less the same for each play through. Some of the better levels I found are when you have to outrun "Death", you are not able to kill "Death", you just have to run as far away from him as possible before he catches you up.  As I said above, there is so much gold to be looted in this game, you can go off the beaten path on the hunt for more of it if you desire, with secret rooms and areas just overflowing with gold all to be found. On top of the gold, there are a few other items you can pick up, Health potions, but these come in the form of dinner on the plate - a nice little feature is that you can actually destroy this meat by hitting it, so that makes the close range combat a little bit more on edge, if you know you are going to need to heal up soon after a fight; it also gives the range characters a need to be a little more precise when it comes to where they aim their attacks.  The final item is a potion, this potion is used as a sort of mana crystal for using your special abilities, they can be few and far between so you should try and pick your moments wisely for when you want to use it.\n\nA full run through Gauntlet on medium mode took me just over three hours - even when you finish the whole run, you can still go back and replay previous levels to farm more gold allowing you to purchase more upgrades. I still plan on playing through the game again on hard mode and also playing it with friends. This will easily mean Gauntlet will have a pretty hefty amount of hours/content on offer. I would say you can easily push about twenty hours from it, and that's just with playing with one character! If you want to get fully immersed in this game, you can be at it for weeks and still not experience it all.\n\nEven though the graphics are nothing spectacular, I wasn't able to play Gauntlet on 4k resolutions with max graphics as the frame rate drops down to the region of 30FPS, which for me is unplayable - but I didn't find the graphical differences between 1080 and 4K to be anything massive so I wasn't too bothered about that.  Gauntlet can be played with a controller, and to be honest, I think it is designed with a controller in mind, given the amount of abilities and keys you need to be pressing; it makes perfect sense to plug in your controller and sit back to play this game. I also played Gauntlet with the Steam controller, and was able to map all of the buttons perfectly to how I wanted to play.\n\nI am going to strongly recommend Gauntlet, the price tag of £14,99 is reasonable but the amount of content and gameplay quality really out way the price. The game has been known to go as low as £3 on Steam and other sites, so if you see it on sale anywhere, do not hesitate to pick it up. You will get so much game time out of this game and it is something that all RPG fans should be playing.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

It doesn’t mean after that you will never touch the game again, for the levels can played over and over again yet still give the same excitement.\n\nIf you want a great co-op game online and offline, this is the game for you.

To put it short and simply this game did not deliver what a veteran Gauntlet player would've liked. Albiet, I was looking forward to something similar to Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and maybe that was my mistake.\n\nPositives:\n-Game runs well\n-Voice lines are nice touch\n-Artifacts (or whatever they're called) were new and interesting\n-Reminded me of playing the original Gauntlet full through\n-Sound effects of the elites sound exactly like the soundbit from Dark Legacy elites which made me nostalgia a bit\n-I felt in full control with both the controller and mouse bindings except for one class\n\nAnd now for the painfully long negatives:\n-Firstly when I saw the opening I saw three areas to go to and figured it would expand maybe once completed, in a fashion to the Gauntlet spawn point would move you lower into the Gauntlet or take you elsewhere, but it didn't. Three very short areas.\n-The areas themselves weren't something to be impressed over. A castle (which did look nice to be fair), a cave which is a boring excuse for no effort, literally two levels are just dark and you can only see your character with a bubble effect, and a cultist lair (in hell?). My 5.7 hours on record was all it took to beat it by myself.\n-The sound would ALWAYS glitch out and become ear-wrenchingly bad anytime a spawner or a mass of enemies would enter your line of sight. Seriously? Half the game was comprised about that, this shouldn't be an issue.\n-Monster spawners were a serious pain to get rid of at times. The only thing that "progressively" made the game harder was that some enemies would "enchant" the spawners so enemies came about twice as fast and playing by yourself make this much more tedious than need be.\n-Wizard customization for keyboard was designed by an idiot. Left-click, shift, right-click to switch to ice. There's about ten numbered keys on top or a nice scroll weel on the damn mouse that were unused for pete's sake.\n-The enemies were so uninspiring. What happened to the countless crazy monsers that were in Dark Legacy like treants, lizardpeople, mummified egyptians, spider-people, minotaurs, AND SO MUCH MORE?\n-Money was worthless in this game. Money is meant to upgrade yourself to do more damage or survive longer, but no instead you complete "achievements" to unlock upgrades to yourself (such as more healing on food and more damage to enemies) while gold is meant to buy these somewhat pointless trinkets that cost WAY TOO MUCH TO UPGRADE. The items to "upgrade" your character such as armor and weapons are just different looking. Nothing new added other than asthetic. That is some cheap crap right there, I'm sorry.\n-THE STORY IS UNBELIEVEABLY POOR! I'm sorry but I had no idea who any of the "bosses" I fought were and what the lore was. Who was this guy who wanted the three shards? Why did these guys have them? Who is Anul'Rekkan (or whatever their names were) and why is his sword so underwhelming in the final fight?\n-Bosses weren't fun and were not even challenging. First try on them all and the final fight was a laugh. Be an archer and just ricght-click aim every enemy until he's done spawning them. Yawn.\n-Also Classic verison makes you want to vomit with how bad it made the game look. Way too confusing to tell anything especially with the cultists' lair.\n\n\nI really wanted to like this game, I did. I loved it in the beginning and was 100% stoked for the rest of the game. Yet, as soon as I got near the end I realized that I really didn't want the game to end like this. I expected mroe from Warner Bros. being on the titlecards. The only thing that would make this redeeming would be if free expansions came out to give you more areas to explore and items that actually were useful.\n\ntl;dr 3/10 You quickly wish you were playing the original Guantlet more than anything.\n\n\nEDIT: Since I intially put this review out (admittedly a bit hurried before I went to work) I have played more into the game, such as increased difficulty, more class expansions and more single-player and multi-player experience. As before I'll just start with what I noticed this time around.\n\nI've got to say playing on a higher difficulty with friends you actually know is phenominal. True most of the fun came from how stupid we play, but nonetheless the credit is to how the game handled us. The Valkyrie literally just runs in and does damage to everything in pair with the Warrior to peel off damage from the Elf and Wizard. The combos were SO much more amazing when your team barely makes it out of a room alive and are rewarded with some gold and much needed food.\n\nMy friends I feel had more fun than me (due to my own reasons listed above) yet with the few bug fixes that came out today I really noticed the change, especially the chrashing on the Wizard class. No more time wasted on having to wait for someone to rejoin in and start the dungeon again. Game moves smoother and feels much more like an arcade with friends, so I HIGHLY RECOMMEND you get a friend or two to purchase this game. For the $20, I feel like it's a decent price. I'd like to say maybe $15 just because of the lack of replayablity after your beat it and (understandably) yet to see changes to asthetic changes.\n\nI feel I was a bit more harsh in my initial review so that's mainly why I came here to adjust it. I still have some audio issues with spawners, but maybe just because I'm hosting the game? I'm not sure really. If you're old enough to have played the old arcade or NES version of this game I'm sure you would feel right at home playing through. If you're expecting it to be Dark Legacy, don't remotely get your hopes up, because it's a completely different set of developers and they've chosen to go back to the game's old roots, which I rather enjoy more when playing with friends.\n\nAltogether I say this game still has a ways to go to get me to change my mind of purchasing this game, but I do like it for what it is. Here's hoping to adding new levels in soon.\n\n6/10- IGN\n"It was okay."","September 24, 2014","false","8.4"," 156 of 253 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","156","253","0","9"

I haven't seen any bugs or had any crashes yet. It is very fun for the first 3-4 hours.\n\nCONS:\nIt is extremely repetative.\nThe "puzzles" are easy and you don't have to think twice about using a key.\nThe characters AREN'T balanced. The melee characters need a complete rehaul.  You can literately get stun locked when you use warrior. If you get hit once as the warrior, there is no way to escape and you can bounce around and get hit 2 3 sometimes 4 times and die. 90% of the time you are running away, kiting as a melee character.\nTHERE IS NO END GAME. You work towards your relic, which is the only thing you can customize besides cosmetics. BUT GUESS WHAT? You can't actually use your relic during the boss fights!! ALSO you can only use it 2 MAYBE 3 times during a dungeon with the way they have it set up.\n\nAll in all, it is a fun game for a couple of hours. Maybe a weekend fling. But there is absolutely no more then 7 maybe 8 hours of fun. $20 is too much. 6/10","September 23, 2014","false","5.6"," 244 of 404 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","244","404","0","13"

With a poor upgrade/shop system (both relics and passive bonuses require excessive grinding and offer negligible improvements to your character for the most part), the gameplay can be difficult to stomach the further you progress\n- The fixed camera and limited perspective make losing your character on-screen (mainly in co-op) and getting hit at the edge of the screen when you can’t see an enemy a more frequent occurrence than they should be. Having to effectively remove the HUD in order to see your character at the bottom of the screen should not be a prerequisite\n- With a 5 ½ hour campaign (Hard difficulty in co-op) encompassing 12 short chapters, combined with little to no story at all, and topped off with unimaginative boss fights... there is zero replayability here outside of a forgettable arena mode.\n\n\nVerdict\n“An immensely mediocre dungeon-crawling experience, Gauntlet can be enjoyable in limited dosages with friends. However the monotony of the gameplay completely drags it down, making it unbearably boring for the majority of it. The game does have an arcade feeling to it, but sadly this can’t overthrow the limited gameplay on offer.”\n\n6/10 TJBs","May 10, 2015","false","6.7"," 115 of 185 people (62%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","62","115","185","5","0"

The only way to get 4 people in one session is to sit in the lobby, but most leave after waiting a few secs making it very difficult to get a full party.  In this version like the arcade there can only be one wizard or one fighter, that means often a player will leave if they cant be the class they want making it more difficult to form a full party.  Its hard to make a full party now, let alone when it gets old noone will play it meaning that most people will be left playing it alone since without drop in it would mean sitting in the lobby for ages hoping even one person had the game installed to join.  If someone quits mid level or if you have 4 good people but one quit and need 4, then you have to quit the match and start over, ugh....  Drop in during gameplay was the first question asked in the forum when it was posted on steam, no wonder it never got an answer :P\n\nThe camera is real weird in the game, it does not focus on your character, instead it shares the screen with all 4 players like an old game where people share the tv.

I am having a lot of fun with it playing it with friends, but I feel like they went so far trying to stay true to the Gauntlet formula that it feels downright unfair and frustrating at times. The biggest problem I have is Death, who pops up every other level, and kills you instantly if you get caught. There is no way to kill him, all you can do is run. I almost rage quit because he popped up directly over a turkey leg and killed me right as I ate it. So not only did I lose a life, but the food was wasted as well.\n\nHaving said that, the combat is fun and really thrilling. It feels just like playing gauntlet in the arcade. Because you know you have limited lives and no auto health regen, there is a real feeling of failure and loss if you all die which makes it way more tense than a lot of "modern" games where you know "Meh, if i die I just respawn and keep going".\n\nOverall it is a decent enough time to recommend.

There are a lot of people that shared my sentiment, and therefore my review will be written with hardcore gamers in mind.\n\nThey removed the unfair/nightmare difficulty from the main campaign. This is indeed stupid to us Unfair players who would challenge ourselves on levels over and over, raging until we won, or if you were like me, soloing without using any relics whatsoever. They killed the fun there, I agree. But you know what? The main campaign is like.. 5% of the game now.\n\nI played NoX way before I played Gauntlet. In NoX, there was a main campaign which, like Gauntlet, was underwhelming. Then there was a "Quest mode", that started you off at a very low difficulty that kept gradually increasing until the game was damn near impossible. In this mode, every 5 maps you complete would open a teleport for that character so you can skip to that level in the future so you don't have to grind out the easy ♥♥♥♥ again. That is exactly what Gauntlet's Endless Mode is. The first teleport floor you find is on level 19.\n\nIf you missed Unfair mode, missing things like gilded hams and turkeys, oh well, it's not in the campaign. Make it to floor 37 on Endless and now you're in Unfair mode again, except the maps are random and can be absolutely brutal. They darken the maps, make ghosts black instead of white to hide in the shade, will spawn four obelisks and two necromancers on you (this happened to me in a ♥♥♥♥ing Reaper map), and best of all, relics don't feel game-breaking anymore. You don't have to feel like a scrub for using them!\n\nThe current version of Gauntlet is the best version by far.

This is a fantastically fun and solid game, which will only benefit from even more content in no-doubt future DLC.  The best part is even though you have to work together and coordinate, you're still trying to backstab one another to steal gold, steal crowns, shoot food, or screenkill someone to Death - all to get a high score and more bonus golds or level up points for your greedy self.\n\nIt seems bizarre to say so, but I think the closest thing I can compare this game to is Super Mario 3D world - which has a similar 'steal the crown' mechanic and passive-aggressive points-battles.  Like Super Mario 3D world, it also has fantastic coop and solidly executed core gameplay that will keep me coming back as they add new levels in expansions.\n\nEveryone on my friends list should own a copy of this game so they can invite me to play it at any time, which I generally will.

Unfortunately what I got was Gauntlet. It's a simple enough game, beat down waves of enemies to advance through dungeons, faces bosses, and then the game ends. I believe there are a total of 9 dungeons with 3 boss battles. A variety in gameplay can be achieved by making the game more or less difficult, but the dungeons will always be the same, enemies the same (but harder to kill), spawns the same, you get the point.\n\nFinding players seems to be difficult to find, on launch I could find lobbies within a few seconds or have players fill my lobby in a few minutes. Now to fill your lobby could take twenty minutes, and finding a lobby will more likely take you into a lobby already in progress.\n\nCould have been amazing, but was instead a four-hour distraction with little in way of replayability. That replayability is taken away more by no one willing to play.

First time was normal mode solo, and then hard mode with my brother (ah, the nostalgia of playing the original!). This game is fairly short - about 5-6 hours. There is a lot of reason to replay this game though: you can level up each of the four classes, upgrade items and gear for up to all four classes, have fun playing with friends and even try to break the speed run records and score records. There are also 5 skill modes ranging from easy to unfair!\n\nOn the downside, there is absolutely no text or voice chat within the game so it can be annoying if you ever need to talk to a party member, especially if by allowing public to join your lobby. If you plan to co-op with friends steam chat and/or steam voice chat (or 3rd party software) are the only ways to communicate without any chat functions in-game.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed playing this game twice and would play it again if another friend wants to co-op through it.","October 20, 2014","true","14.7"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","1"

Honestly, I never saw this coming.\n\nBack when the game was first released (pre-ordered it about half a year in advance, it was a friggin Gauntlet reboot after all), a lot of people said it didn't really have the feel of the original games, primarily in part due to not having an infinite randomly generated dungeon. I was one of the people who actually liked it though and found it to be greatly enjoyable.\n\nNow they've released version 2.0, the 'Slayer' edition. However, slayer in this sense seems to be referring to the enemies rather than the players. Sure, they've added in Endless mode and given us the procedurally generated levels that made the original games so great, but they've changed virtually everything else in the game too. Including beefing up the enemies to the point that a large group of them is complete overkill on a solo player. On easy difficulty. You may be thinking "it's a 4-player co-op game, why are you trying to solo it?", and if you are then my question to you is, at which point in any of the original Gauntlet games did you absolutely need more than 1 player to get anywhere? I'm not really sure what compelled the developers to make such changes, but I'm definitely not the only one who finds the update to not be worth it. Maybe they're trying to appeal to the 'hardcore' crowd, maybe someone cleared the (now non-existant) Unfair difficulty and declared it to be easy. Who knows.\n\nI really want to give this game a positive review, and if they revert/alter a lot of these changes I will. In its current state though, I simply can't.","August 12, 2015","false","4.3"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","18","24","0","0"

What I have seen in the negative reviews is "the game is too short, I finished in 3 hours." or, "It is really repetitive and boring." The first statement is false, and the second is an uninformed opinion. The game is not short at all.  I have over 20 hours of time on it and finished around the 24 hour mark. Bear in mind, I spent some time grinding and replaying some levels with friends. Which leads me to the second statement. To say a Dungeon Crawler is repetitive is like saying a Bugatti Veyron is too fast. While it may be true, that is the whole reason behind it. Dungeon Crawlers are supposed to be repetitive. That, in my opinion, is where the fun is. Grinding through waves of enemies to level up and finally beat that unstoppable boss. And trust me, the bosses in this game do not mess around.    So to answer the two main questions. "Is the game short?" That depends on you. But you should be able to get at least 10 hours of playtime. "Is it repetitive?" Yes, yes it is. Its a Dungeon Crawler, if you were not expecting that, the game is probably not for you.\n\nNow, the story of the game is as follows. A Wizard named Morak summoned an immense magical dungeon known by heroes and common people as "the Gauntlet". Inside is the usual treasure, traps and evil creatures. And of course, no one has ever made it out. So Morak calls on the four protagonists promising them wealth and all sorts of goodies and of course, a sword slashing, fire blasting good time.\n\nThe heroes you can pick from are the Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf. The Warrior is my personal favorite. He has plenty of health, and can easily cut down waves of enemies. The Valkyrie has a short sword that can swing incredibly fast at the cost of short range. A shield that can block all means of damage, and she can throw her shield to have a sort of chain lighting effect. The wizard is the most complex. In order to cast his spells (with the default controls) You have to push the "Shift", "Space", or "RMB" keys to conjure the spell.  What makes him more complex is that pressing "Shift" first and "Space" second may make a fire spell. While pressing "Space" first and "Shift" second may create an ice spell. It requires some getting used to. And then finally we have the the Elf. He has a dodge ability, a bomb that can be attached to his arrows or be placed, and can fire arrows incredibly fast.\n\nThe gameplay, as mentioned before, can be repetitive. But this is a game you need to grind in. The "levels" in the game are called masteries. You level them up by completing certain tasks. For example. The "Mummy Slayer" mastery may require 5000 mummy kills to reach the Bronze rank. After doing that, you get increased damage against mummies and the towers that spawn them. Each enemy type has a mastery to go with it. Making the grinding worth while in the long run.\n\nThe actual levels themselves are divided up as follows. There are 3 sets of 4 doors each. The first door in each set consists of three basic levels. The second door has a procedurally  generated level and tons of places requiring keys. And the third door contains a level that requires performing a specified task to open the exit. And the fourth door in each set contains the boss. To make up for what may seem like a repetitive formula. Each set of doors has a different atmosphere and enemy types. The first set takes place in a sand buried crypt containing Mummies and skeleton warriors. The second set is themed in dark caves that are sometimes, literally pitch black. Here you fight orcs, grunts and the occasional Spider queen. The final set appears to be placed in a volcano or Hell itself. Here you will find fanatic cultists, and many types of demonized creatures.\n\nNow, I won't say anything about the bosses. The first two are just challenging enough to make the victory worth it all. While the final boss and ending seem just hastily thrown together. I won't spoil anything of course, but the final boss was, in my opinion, more annoying then fun, and the ending did not have any closure. It left me wondering, and to honest, very dissappointed. But the game in its entirety made up for it.\n\nGauntlet is a fantastic Dungeon Crawler in my opinion and a nice addition to the series. If you have the spare change like I did, pick it up for some friends and play a marathon or two. Good times can be found in every nook and cranny in the depths of this particular dungeon.","October 14, 2014","true","27.4"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","25","37","0","0"

If you're going to do a reboot, at least try to reach parity with the original. Difficulty levels add absolutely nothing to the equation, merely increasing enemy health (which is lazy and definitely not content.) Enemy spawners have inflated health to begin with. Snatching gold and items before the other players is part of the charm of Gauntlet, but some of the masteries and achievements encourage bad play. Like you really want to team up with someone looking to grind their death count. There are no doodads to speak of - no teleport tiles, invisibility, or if you're familiar with the NES port, reflective shot - nothing of the sort. Some of the relics replicate those features, but you've got to grind gold to get them and fuel them with potions. The problem with potions is that they're rare, you have to share and you can't buy them in the shop. So most boss fights see zero relic use. Then there's the length: 12 areas, consisting of 36 levels and 3 bosses. In other words, an indefensible joke. The artists got their palette from a bowl of gumbo. The game looks like one of those souvenir Wild West photos you get at the boardwalk. Enjoy your stay in Brown Town.

The "poisonous" air in the dungeon that constantly harmed you in the arcade predecessor is gone and if you die, it's due to the enemies. The cultists get some cheap kills from time to time, which is plain frustrating. Other than that, the game feels balanced, but you have to grind to unlock it's full potential. A lot.\n\nCONTROLS 3.5/5\nI have played it with a controller and never had any issues with response times. The button layout is convenient, but not rebindable. Jumping over gaps sometimes feels wonky.\n\nMUSIC & SOUND 4/5\nThe music fits the scenario and the sound effects are really good. I own a localized version [GER], the voice actors sound like lackluster porn actors.\n\nVISUALS 4/5\nI enjoy the visuals and the different locations are distinctive. I like the gore and overall special effects. Sometimes you can lose sight of your character, especially with a full team in a crowd of enemies.\n\nADDITIONAL INFO\nYou (and your friends) fight through different dungeons from start to exit. You gain continues, when you fill the bar at the top of the screen by killing off hordes of enemies. If you run out of them, it's game over. You have to share gold and other resources (food, potions) with your team. There are bossfights at the end of each area which require a bit more tactics than the standard enemies. This is the standard game mode. Besides that, you can fight in the Colloseum (a daily challenge) to gain more gold and some hero specific items. You also have the option to start an endless game to see how many dungeons you can clear without dying.\n\nWith gold you can purchase special skills, items or potion effects, which adds to the gameplay. The most interesting parts are the unique upgrades for each hero.\n\nI have enjoyed this game so far and I recommend it, if you want something diabloesque without the hassle to store and manage items, inventory limitations and clicking through complex skill trees. If you want that, you won't be satisfied. It is easy to pick up (except the mage) and play. Be it for 30 minutes or 3 hours.\n\nI have had some serious issues with my connection crashing (either hosting or joining), so at the moment I would recommend local coop or single player to avoid these frustrations, taking away a good measure of the game tho. I have contacted WB Games support with this issue, but unfortunately received your standard "Have you tried turning it off and on again" reply.","April 7","true","16.6"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Which maybe that's not what they were going for. I think it could be a good lan game now and then but that's about the end of it. The "secret walls" show signs of wear and are also given away by the sudden appearance of explosive barrels in the area that you need to destroy the wall. The dungeons are very linear, no dead ends, no exploration aside from bonus treasure rooms, hardly even multiple ways to get around the dungeon.\n\nAgain maybe the N64 version isn't what they were going for. But. Back then secret walls could show no hint of needing to be destroyed and you did it just by shooting them, no obvious barrels nearby. Sometimes you would break the wall and step on a switch which yes had an arrow pointing in a direction but it could be pointing to anything. You could be at the end of the map and the arrow just points back across the whole map. You now have the whole map to explore trying to figure out wtf that switch did (this is an example which people may be frustrated with). Those were difficult puzzles.\n\nI have a hard time putting a definite yes or no on this game but I wouldn't tell people to buy it which I think is the point of "do you recommend this game?".

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/supafastsc/recommended/258970/","supafastsc","Mr Breeze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/supafastsc/","607 products in account","This game does homage to the Atari classic of running around dungeons, killing baddies, collecting gold, and finding keys to unlock new doors.  But the reboot also adds a bit more depth with semi-robust game mechanics with powers fueled by potions rather than being just a shooter with a "clear screen bomb"  The characters are unique and fun and have balanced strengths and weaknesses.  As someone who does not play dungeon-crawler games like Diablo or the sorts I found it fun without being overly technical staying true to its button-mashing ancestors.  And the game's levels are designed for replayability so you can keep going and upgrade all your characters.  The prologue has you learn the basics of each character.  Then you are able to play through the main game with friends or solo.\n\nThere are multiple stages.  Each stage consists of 4 levels and 3 rooms in each level.  This is with the exception of the last level which is one room containing a boss character you must defeat with skill and smarts (simple puzzles).  The room in each level consists of your basic dungeon running and fighting collecting gold and items.  The second part is a dungeon run to stay alive and avoid death's touch.  He will fade in and out throughout the map and you must try and complete it witout getting sucked into death's vortex.  The third part of each level consists of a final larger battle with hordes of adversaries that you must survive in order to complete the level.  The final level as I said is a single boss match where you have to figure out how to beat each one while not being overrun by additional hordes.\n\nYou collect coins in the game and those are used to purchase artifacts.  You can equip 2 artifacts at the same time and use them by collecting potions.  For each potion you can use one of your equiped artifacts once.  You can collect up to 5 potions.  Artifacts can be leveled up multiple times for increased effects and abilities.  If you die in mid-combat a timer appears and when it counts down to 0 you can rejoin the fight.  But you can only revive yourself if there are continue coins available.  You get revive/continue coins by killing more and more enemies.  If you run out of coins you cannot revive and as in say Left for Dead, if all players die at the same time, it's GAME OVER for the whole team.\n\nOne thing I found surprising as a avid player of the coin-op version, was that not all the characters have ranged attacks.  that is left solely to the elf and wizard.  The warrior and valkyrie are hand to hand fighters with some decent dash and range attacks but do not actually shoot any reasonable distance with primary attacks (special moves aside).\n\nI've got 8 friends that have this game and we enjoy it very much.  It was well worth the $15 each if bought in a Steam 4-Pack and will likely be on sale by December for even less.  If you want to play it though and support the developers.  It's well WORTH the current price.","September 27, 2014","true","044.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

Far too hard on solo for weak little Wizards (and me!) and much more progress to be made in coop.  One-Two-Three-or-Four players run the Gauntlet sharing loot, food, and death.\n\nSimilar top-down vein to Chaos Engine (same era) and also dead island epidemic (if you're blessed with youth!)  Gauntlet is 1980's Dungeon's and Dragon's-esque nostalgia of simple mazes and underground dungeons bought up to date for modern times.  Potions, keys, monsters, ghosts, imps and beasties horde the map, reminiscent of L4D2 frenzies, with end-of-level bosses to defeat also.\n\nI like how each time you die, it takes a few more seconds compared to last time until you can respawn.  If the rest of your teammates die before your respawn counter allows you back in, you all die and so have to start the entire level from scratch.\n\nI currently have audio stutter and white noise, fps is very low (poor AMD gpu) but workable with the game only using 0.7GB vram of my 2GB available for some reason.  I expect things will improve with patches/fixes sooner rather than later given a forum full of issues.  It seems nVidia users have a more optimised experience.\n\nA very colourful arcade experience, Gauntlet has decent weapon effects, spells and explosions.  The scenes appear crisp at 1920x1080.  The voiceovers are very British, and humourous.  I make no comment re the stereotyping of the ever-hungry Irish bomb-throwing Elf...\n\nIt may prove too repetitive a game long-term for most gamers, but it's price point is about right.  The difficulty ups to 'unfair' to challenge the maestros who wish to persevere.  Each character can be upgraded using in-game coins to purchase cosmetics and potion powers, aiding longevity.  The steam cheevos are plentiful and many revolve around multiple deaths, in fact, it is actively encoraged in the game to boost your skill set.\n\nA nice change of pace, and no doubt if it proves popular the inevitable dlc packs will arrive in due course with further levels, beasts and cosmetics.\n\nEdit due to update: With the latest patch, the audio stutter issues I had are now gone. :)","September 23, 2014","true","22.5"," 40 of 67 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","40","67","0","4"

As I was playing with a friend from work and the competition became very intense — it was not about winning anymore, it was about getting more gold by whatever means necessary.

So what do I think? Well it is a tricky one, I think if you hold it up against the early games in the series this seems the next logical step. Keep to the 4 character format, and make use of co-op (No Diablo players running off like kids on drugs grabbing loot, you are all stuck in the same area!). The 4 characters are varied but only have one primary skill each, I think there should be some options here. There are 3 zones, with 10 levels each. Not a vast amount, but enough until they release some DLC (I guess they plan to, depending on popularity).\nYou can pay for cosmetic costumes with in-game cash  (why these couldn't add minor stat perks is anyone's guess) and you get relics that act as specials for potions (these can be levelled up and are quite varied). There are also perks you unlock by completing achievements and this is where my main criticism comes in. This is a great idea and would keep you coming back, but their should be more and evenly spaced. You get some for dying once, others for killing thousands of monsters!\nI find this game fun, and will play it more in small doses chasing some achievements and harder modes. I completed normal mode in a few hours but then you have hard and unfair to go at, where good teammates are a required (let's hope there are enough active players later on). Plus I should have earned a few more perks by then. I think the price is a bit steep for what you get (I think it should be about 1/3 cheaper). Also as I said at the start it ignores some of the advances made by some of the newer Gauntlet games such as more character choices and a 3D perspective, but for us old boys it mostly ticks the nostalgic box. I give it a thumbs up, but it is a bit of a *shrug* too.","September 30, 2014","true","16.5"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","2"

But you do get to collect lots of loot, and also Turkeys to eat to rekindle your health as you will be up against hoards of zombies and other creatures, that you will encounter as you move along through the dungeons.The characters you play are rather tiny in the game so i hope you have good eye sight, even though they are tiny, i still had fun playing Gauntlet. Also you can play this game with an Xbox controller quite well. It can be played in single player mode or play with up to 4 players or friends including yourself, I tried  both single and  online and found playing with others was rather more fun except they pinch all the loot and food before i could get to it, so remember to share the food and stash please.\n\nIt would be great to join in the game with some friends, and this can be easily set up to do so, if our times allow for convenient game play.\n\nOnly negatives I had are :\n\nI had a few issues starting the game as it keeped crashing at the start, but after some persistance and checking the game cache files and a reboot of steam, it ran beautifully.

Each world (or section if you will) has a theme, much like Legends, however each level within that section is pretty much the same. It seems like the developers did not care enough to make each area unique and I was left feeling like I had been playing the same level over and over again. Zero imagination was put into the creation of each level. It is almost like the developers created a program that would spit out some random levels using a small set of textures and models.\n\n3) There is no in game communication for multiplayer. Multiplayer is a disaster. Without communication players cannot coordinate whatsoever. "Hey man, don't shoot that barrel, we need it to unlock a secret area!" "Oh secret area eh? I had no idea!" Yeah those conversations never have a chance to happen. If you're a completionist like me, you might be matched with someone who likes to run to the next area, completely oblivious to the small forture waiting on the left hand side of the screen. Which reminds me: There is a sort of doorway that takes you to the next area. If someone were not paying attention and goes through that doorway, the game sends everyone to the next area, even if the other players know of a plethora of gold toward another part of the screen. Without a communication system there is no way to tell anyone to hold on a second before heading to the next area.\n\n4) The gear system is a joke. So the game boasts that you can modify your character with cool gear etc etc however the selection is dismal and only relics affect your character. Your loadout does NOTHING to improve stats or anything like that. Different outfits are cool and all but why would I spend my hard earned gold on purely cosmetic items (that don't even look good btw) when I can spend the gold on the relics that will actually help my character. I understand that the game just came out but I really hope they make improvements to the gear system because it is terrible right now.\n\nSo in summary I was very disappointed in this game and if there were some way I could get my money back then I would. Perhaps my expectations were too high but Gauntlet Legends was a great game for its time and I automatically assumed that they would create something that would feed my nostalgia and provide a great experience at the same time. I will never make that assumption about a game again. A red flag I should have paid attention to from the start was that Warner Brothers and another no-name studio created this game. I am in no way insulting indie developers but I dont think WB or the other company (don't even remember its name) have the experience developing video games necessary to do this game justice.\n\nPlease please please do not spend money on this game. Put your money into something, anything else. If you are a Gauntlet Legends fan you may find this game to be absolutley horrible.\n\n","September 23, 2014","false","2.2"," 22 of 37 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","22","37","0","0"

My review.\nThe good: Great game play 4 classes with fun abilities making it fun to kill things. The boss fights all have their own challenge to them. You can play 4 player on the same computer. Didn't feel repetitive for different levels.\nThe bad: Only 4 classes and multiple people can not play the same class. Difficulty did not increase as game progressed. The game was simple with no puzzles. No dazzling graphics. Normally I do not judge on graphics as a negative factor however I expected more game play. There are only 12 levels, 3 of which are just fighting a boss. There are no mini bosses to challenge you no unique monsters or loot. The overpriced gear you can buy is only for visual appearance. There is no findable items as there was in previous games. The relics you buy are also overpriced you will beat the game before you can fully upgrade one relic. The only reason it didn't feel repetitive was because the game was only 4-5 hours long.\nVerdict 7/10. Would recommend playing it, would not recommend buying it. It is a arcade game if you have 3 friends you constantly game with, it's only $20, might as well, but don't tell everyone else they should buy it just have them come over. If they opned up the code to the community for custom levels it would be a must have.","September 23, 2014","false","18.7"," 57 of 104 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","57","104","0","1"

For $15 bucks (each) and based on past Gauntlet games {Legends and Legacy} we figured it was worth a go. Traditional Gauntlet games get a ton of replay value so the $15 should merit that. In either case let me break into the actual review\n\nGauntlet starts you off by having you play each class; Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf/Archer and Wizard.\n\nWarrior plays like in the typical hack and slash style. Valkyrie feel very Captain America'esc but still hack and slashy. Elf/Archer plays like a character from Smash TV. Lastly Wizard plays like Invoker from Dota 2 (to elaborate you have 9 spells and based on what elements you combine {Lightning, Fire, Ice} you get a different spell with each spell having its own cooldown). With each unique character you sort of get a different button schema. Where Warrior and Valkyrie (I might need clarification on this) smash buttons. The Elf/Archer and Wizard utilize the right analog.\n\nOnce you go through the tutorial you have the ability to start a game or begin a lobby. The lobby system is fantastic. There's no shift tabbing into the steam community to select a person's profile to invite them into a game. You simple click the button to open lobby (for me it was 'Y' on the Xbox control or 'X' on the PS3 based on the conversation software). and it brought up a list of friends currently playing Gauntlet who I could invite. The only gief is I wish it only brought up friends who have / are playing Gauntlet. I still get my full list of steam list friends which I think is silly.\n\nEach selection is unique so can't have two Warriors or Valkyries etc. Once your in the game you have worlds to choose from... there's only 3 worlds with 4 levels so that was sort of a let down from the get go.\n\nAlso in the lobby you decide on your difficult. Easy is like a light version of Normal so you have more health and monsters are not as strong. Normal you get infinite number of re-spawns. Hard requires that you have tokens to re-spawn other players and Unfair you simply don't re-spawn and food rarely/never(?) exist. We went with Normal for our play-through.\n\nThere's also a shop that sells artifacts however to use the artifacts you must use potions you find in the level. So potions are no longer a generic AOE effect but are used in conjunction with artifacts. Shops items can also be upgraded and few items no longer have the 'one time use' feel. This gives potions sort of a customized feel however ultimately make them useless on boss as no potions spawn on those fights.\n\nAnother thing that doesn't exist in the shop now is 'stats'. 'Stats' or any sort of character enhancement is gained by spamming a specific character skill (typically bound to a button or in the Wizards case combine two buttons to make a spell). Other character enhancements (which are called Masteries) are gained through eating food, dying and collecting gold provide a passive bonus rather than active.\n\nAs to the actually game play...it felt super linear at first and unfortunately stayed that way for most of the game. There was very few 'whoops we went the wrong way' or 'did we miss something'. If such situations occurred it was a result of a bad camera angle hiding a wall that wasn't visible rather than a puzzle to figure out.\n\nThere's of course game elements to try to lighten the mood like players can light barrels of TNT on fire and throw it at friends or destroy food that a friend is about to pick up. There's also preset emotes that players can spam at each other. While were on emotes the characters periodically compliment each other when they get a long kill streak...this is 'cute' at first but due to its frequency gets old fast. The last sort interactive element was the crown which when worn gives the player at the end a gold bonus. However if they get hit the crown drops and another player can pick it up.\n\nLevel 1 and 2 of each world was typically presenting the theme. Level 3 was typically a small boss battle arena and level 4 was purely focused on the boss. Bosses were a hybrid of spamming the attack key and figuring out puzzles.\n\nSo general flow of the game was 'pick a world' -> 'pick a level' -> 'playthrough it' -> 'return to town' -> 'debating on buying artifacts' -> 'pick a world' repeat.\n\nNow with all that said would I recommend picking up the game... probably not at it's current release price or I would definitely split the $15 bucks among several people and play it via Local. Even then not enough bang for the buck for me to recommend it.\n\nAs a group of 4 players we beat the game in about 4.3 hours. It really emphasizes on 'party play' and I could see it getting frustrating solo. There's no 'true' leveling system so you don't really feel the progression. You get a new skill to spam or your cool downs on a spell are reduced but your overall power still feels 'fixed'. As I mentioned before there are 'artifacts' that you can buy with gold earned in game but they are nothing game breaking.\n\nOnce you complete the game you do unlock cosmetic items however they require that you use in-game gold to buy them... so your reward for completing the game on a certain difficulty is unlocking an item in which you have to grind the levels you just beat to get the gold to buy the cosmetic item....yeah...no.\n\nOn a few minor notes there's a few times where death shows up which leads to comical deaths (Death no longer drains he simple kills you) but is quickly forgotten. There's no alternative classes like Tigress, Jester, Minotaur and etc. After we finished playing we expected that they would be DLC or something silly. Pojo (aka EGG911) is not in the game as well as 'X IS NOW IT' system is out as well.\n\nThe novelty and hopefully nostalgia you hope to draw out the game is typically gone after the first few hours. At its core it took what made the Gauntlet series unique and made it feel like a generic hack and slash.\n\nOh one last thing before I close this out...the soundtrack is okay but nothing stellar or to write home about.\n\nEdits below (due to comments section limitation of 1,000 characters or less)\n\nResponse to Jareth Gawain on 09/28/2014:\n\nCorrect Jareth Gawain however I find that overall it pulls more aspects from Legends and Legacy then the original Gauntlet.\n\nThe original Gauntlet arcade aspects that differed it from other hack and slash/beat-'em-up arcade games at that time was the concept of a time limit.  Players health totals constantly dropped and there weren't many/any titles prior to this that forced players to find a way to conclude the level in an effective manner.  This game mechanic at the time was complimented by a labyrinth-esc design which futher penalized player for making an incorrect choice for not finding the right way out.  Am I saying that such a mechanic(s) should have been implemented into Gauntlet™?\n\nAbsolutely not or rather if they did so perhaps it happens on a higher difficulty.  As I stated I did not play on anything higher than 'Normal' so this may already maybe implemented in the game.  The above game mechanic(s) I didn't feel in Gauntlet™.  The game felt very linear and more Legends/Legacy then the arcade versions.\n\nTo the point regarding Legends and/or Legacys I felt Gauntlet™ drew more from these mondern versions than its predecessors.  Concepts of character progression, item shops, boss battles, quotes such as 'needs food badly' and many others pull from the days of Legends and/or Legacy.  Which to me as a individual playing the game I think is a good thing that they didn't try to keep the pure rustic feel of the past in Gauntlet™.  For these above reasons I feel Gauntlet™ feels more like Legends and/or Legacy than the original arcade boot.","September 27, 2014","false","4.3"," 38 of 68 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","38","68","0","2"

That being said, I don't feel like this reimagining of Gauntlet does a good job at being a good Gauntlet-game or a very exciting arcade-game.\n\nThe reasons for this assessment are manyfold. My main gripe is that they kind of broke the classic Gauntlet formula in a poor attempt at modernizing the game to appeal to 2014 audiences. What do I mean by that? Well, new Gauntlet SHOULD have been a twinstick-shooter with a melee component - instead we get a rather dull hack'n'slay were fifty percent of the cast suffer from not having their ranged attacks anymore. In fact, only the Elf plays anything like the Gauntlet I remember - the wizard, being all Magicka-like, is actually completely screwed and way too fiddly for my taste. Melee classes are all about kiting hordes and then killing a whole bunch in one fell swoop. The game kinda sits between two chairs, they wanted to make the characters more diverse than they were before - but in doing so they broke the subtle balancing of the original. At the same time, unfortunately, combat isn't quite as awesome as say something like Sacred 3 or Iron Fisticle, two games which kind of do the Gauntlet-thing but are so much more exciting and really make you feel powerful. Gauntlet just doesn't have much impact and seems kinda wimpy.\n\nNext up; the stages are extremely boring. The original Gauntlet had like a hundred different mazes, that were so much more interesting than the entirety of this reboot. You know, there were teleporter pads, hidden walls, warpzones and all kinds of other stuff along some very interesting and sometimes even quite clever layouts. Some of the labyrinths had such striking layouts that you would remember them - in the 2014 reboot everything blurs together. New Gauntlet is mostly letting you repeat the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over again. Each of the three "worlds" is split into 3x3 segments that are basically: Stage I: dungeon crawling, Stage II: flee/survive either Death, darkness or fireballs and Stage III: arena-battles. The forth segment is usually an uninspired boss fight. Which are not very exciting in multiplayer and downright tedious in single player. Reminding me more about the average MMO than proper Arcade-stuff.\n\nThe problem is that the very few elements that are in the game (monster spawners, locked doors) are so basic that they get old incredibly fast. And new Gauntlet has no idea how to mix it up and keep you interested for longer periods of time (as a reminder: spawners in the old game would be tents or piles of bones, fitting style-wise to the monsters they would spawn) . Frankly, once you beaten the very first stage you have seen about 75% of what the rest of the game has to offer. Pushing blocks or pulling levers doesn't exactly knock me off my feet.\n\nIt also doesn't help that the game is visually bland and only has three tilesets (brown dungeon, dark-greyish underground caverns, fiery-red temple complex). The original Gauntlet may not have been the prettiest game around, but it did mix up the colors and tilesets a whole lot more. The tilesets are well done in new Gauntlet, but they are also super-generic and you will be stuck with them for extended periods of time. The abstract nature of the visuals in combination with the much more interesting layouts of the mazes kept the olden Gauntlets stay fresh for much longer than the reboot, which suffers from a bad case of "didn't we just play this exact stage some minutes ago?". Repetition is kind of a big deal in Gauntlet 2014, and I don't like that.\n\nAnother big flaw is the introduction of stat boosts for "achieving" a ton of "masteries" which turn the game into something of a grindfest (and yes, I am aware of the irony considering we are talking Gauntlet here). This is the "kill 15.000 enemies to gain 25% more damage" deal. Personally, I always feel that stuff like this is basically the dev cutting down on proper balancing and really crafting a challenge with a proper learning curve and instead offers a solution to "outlevel" content if the player sucks. Wanna tackle those higher difficulties, better grind to make that secondary attack of yours recharge a lot faster, get more HP from food and all those other kind of significant upgrades. The thing with Gauntlet is, none of these changes would have been necessary. In fact, they kill my motivation to ever touch this game again - want to hang with the cool kids and try a new character? Well, you better start grinding to have a fighting chance on hard- or unfair-mode.\n\nTalking of difficulty settings, I was hoping for some "hard" or "unfair" levels - like those warpzones back in the day that instantly brought you to some really tough places. Instead they just fiddled with the amount of life enemies can take as well as the amount of damage they shell out. Instead of offering me 27 levels to replay over and over again on all 4 difficulties, I would have rather liked some actual handcrafted/unique challenges instead of just changing enemy stats. In my opinion, making 100 different levels and split them into four difficulty categories would have been much more interesting - I can remember games like Trog or Lemmings doing that, and always thought it was a clever way at keeping things entertaining. Because, once you figure out the strategies needed for a level in Gauntlet, all you need to endure is the raised stats of your enemies - which means more kiting, but ultimately offers very little change from what you did before.\n\nHonestly, I am a bit underwhelmed by the stuff new Gauntlet brings to the table. Chances are that I am spoiled by both Sacred 3 and Iron Fisticle, which I would personally recommend over Gauntlet any day. Not only is Sacred 3 a stunning looking game with an amazing color palette and beautiful tech, it is also awesome in 4 player mode when the entire screen explodes once everyone unleashes their full combat potential. Iron Fisticle on the other hand is just pure & perfect arcade action, light on the level ups and stats and instead focusing on fast reactions and cool, screen-clearing bonus weapons. Both games feel great and so much more on point than Gauntlet, which is highly unremarkable in almost all things imaginable (the weird camera and the rather tiny player characters / monster sure add to the fact) that the well done 80ies Dungeons & Dragons atmosphere can't win me over. So-called improvements just don't help Gauntlet in my book. This is unfortunate, but luckily we got good alternatives on Steam right now - hopefully, future DLC will fix the lack of variety in Gauntlet.","September 26, 2014","false","5.9"," 62 of 114 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","62","114","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/258970/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","I have played my fair share of Gauntlet games in my day. Originally in the arcades, every death meant I had to pump more quarters into the machine. Now, with the series hitting multiple consoles spanning different generations, Gauntlet is back after a rather long hiatus. Is it back to the feelings we all know and love, or was that really just me looking back with rose-tinted glasses? After playing this, I may be going with the latter.\n\nIn a very arcadey fashion, Gauntlet puts players in the role of one of four classes. In a top-down view, they will hack and slash (or shoot arrows and fireballs depending on the class) at hoards of enemies while they try to make it through the dungeons while gathering as much gold as they can. Don’t forget getting chased by death himself in some of the more frantic levels.\n\nProgression is done not through leveling up, but through masteries. There are even death masteries that will allow characters to not take as much damage from certain traps if they die enough from them. Basically, doing normal stuff throughout the game will allow players to get better at that certain skill. It’s not groundbreaking in any way, but it at least let me improve my characters.\n\nThe classic classes are all back, and each plays very differently from one another. The Warrior is a brutal melee fighter, the Valkyrie utilizes her shield to both block and attack from afar, the Elf uses bows and bombs and the Wizard combines elements to fire off magical attacks. Each has their own play style and really changes up how the player will handle situations, but in the end, most of it is pretty mindless.\n\nThe standout here is the co-op play. Online multiplayer with three other people was a frantic, hack n slash mess, but in a good way. Since it didn’t take much thought to play, we ended up have a fun time just hacking away at enemies while talking. Also, fighting for the crown when someone would get hit quickly became the meta-game of it all, even though the crown does nothing except increase points at the end of the level.\n\nThe story is minimal at best, but the voice acting that is there, along with the comedic overtones are well done and even made me laugh a few times. Sure, there is no “Sexy pants!” being screamed like in Sacred 3, but the dialog that is there never takes itself seriously and gives off a bit of charm that I enjoyed.\n\nGauntlet isn’t much of a thinking man’s game. Find a class you like and have at it. The Wizard will be the one most people avoid, but even then, with a few other buddies along for the ride, it can be a rather fun time. Single player can get a bit more monotonous, but it is the same for the multiplayer; just having some others to share in the mindless action helps out a lot.\n\nFor $20, players get a rather fun game. Yeah, I still feel more love for the older versions of the game, but I think that’s just the nostalgia in me. Even in single player, I didn’t mind taking on the hoards of enemies with my shield throwing Valkyrie. Jumping online is where the game gets hectic, but way more fun, and the tongue-in-cheek nature of the dialog and story offer up a few laughs at times. I would say pick it up, but if you do, try to at least convince one or two friends to pick it up with you. You’ll all have a more enjoyable time together.\n\nRecommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","January 14, 2015","true","28.3"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","21","36","0","0"

"Your health is getting low!"\nOh you shot the food? It's gone now.\nSecret passages\nRUN FROM DEATH\nThings missing from past Gauntlet games:\nPersistant Stats. The armor from the shop? Yeah it's cosmetic.\nBuying benificial shop items. Besides the stat boosts which is obviously gone. You also can't buy magic potions, halos, that little Phoenix that would follow you around and add projectiles on top of your own attacks. Yeah none of that exists. You can only buy 'relics' now.\nNo shield button. That's gone too. One class has a shield. The others have different abilities like charge or a dodge roll. Wizard doesn't have any of those. But he does have a spell shield he can cast that breaks after a short duration.\nThings that are largely different from past Gauntlet games:\nCharacters have a skill that goes on cooldown and a couple benificial abilities instead of a basic attack that would automatically choose a ranged or melee attack.\nMagic potions don't damage things on the screen. Now they're used to power 'relic' items you purchase with gold from the shop. Not necessarily as great or had the same powerful impact as dropping a lightning potion on the screen and frying things to a crisp.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you have never played a Gauntlet game. You might actually find this game is eh, alright. Not terrible. But not great either.\n\nBut if you're a past Gauntlet fan. Look elsewhere. Holy crap.

Not only that there is no way to change the movement scheme. So here we have a 2014 game that use the 4 arrows for movement. How very 1980's. Don't waste your money. Buy another game.

Some reasons i don't recommend Gauntlet:\n\n- Short, 12 chapters (3 of those are just boss battles). About 5 hours.\n- Can't buy Relics (expensive items that require you to use a potion) inside the chapters, only between them\n- the bonus from achievements are stupid (like +1% damage)\n- Relic system is stupid, they are expensive and require you to find potions (those are rare). If you are playing coop with 4 people, don't expect to use relics more than once a chapter. The abilities itself are pretty stupid or worthless, like some seconds of invulnerability (but you cant attack as well) or a gargoyle summon (with an AI programmed to suicide as soon as possible).\n- Food and potion system is stupid, especially because you can destroy them with abilities if you do so before you pick them up\n- Lacks character progress\n- stages and enemies are very similar to Diablo 2, lacking personality\n- The Wizard class is a copy of Invoker from Dota2 or Magicka\n- Shallow story\n- pointless stages with "Death" following you around, forcing a time trial\n- Difficulty is not well implemented. Easy is too easy, anything other than that is too hard. Game over is frustrating as it starts from the beginning of the chapter.\n- Easy puzzles","December 27, 2014","false","5.4"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","0"

There is a lot of things which making you feel that something is quite wrong. First of all, cooperation: there is just no way to speak with others (no chat), not even an emotes or basic movement directions for party — you have to gues what others have on their mind. It could be played solo, but this way its pretty booring and super hard. So you have to eather use real life friends or skype to talk with people, which isnt really good. When you enter the lobby... Well, there is no lobby lol. You simply pick desired difficulty among 4 (where the first one is actually hard and the last one is 'bloody hell, damn it, get away from me!!!'). And if you want to beat some special level among 12, at current exact moment — you cant do it, cus there is no way to predict which one party leader will choose to play (but you can create ye own game and wait few hours for people to connect to you). Also this influences other side of game — you can pick two of many special abbilities, which are good on some levels and bad on other and there is no way to understand what to take with you since you have no idea where gonna go.\n\nNow a bit about classes balance. Warrior is beyond patheticness. Seriously, this guy is slow, his dodge ability requires charge and have direction restrictions. Autoattacks damage is very low, so he needs 3-4 of those to wipe one single smallest enemy. He isnt able to do anything cus mostly have to fight in melee combat with only one aoe damage skill. And some monsters can two shot you. The other problem — you must click mouse button once to execute each swing of your weapon, which is just lame and requires button mashing your mouse. While mage have 7 active AoE spells, 2 crowd controlls and mostly one shots any monster. Yes mage also can simply push and hold attack button to land spells non stop.\n\nNow a bit more about coop. There is almost no way to get fun of your team, cus when you destroy their food, deal damage to them by enviroment or corner (preventing any movement) — this leads to their funny death, but also will make others members to die, cus monsters dont care about your dumb fun jokes, they simply kill you. And when everyone dies, you will have to replay SAME level WITHOUT any random generation. Dont take me wrong — game is nice, there is lots of secret areas, nice graphics, many hard situations to overgo, but playing same area over and over and over... You cant just revive mates like in Left 4 Dead 2, nooo,  you gonna suffer. It is very interesting to play each stage for the first time, since there is special traps and logical 'mini games', but only for once.\n\nBetween levels you can spend gathered gold to buy stuff. Each class has his own treasury chest so you have to actuall play (farm a lot)with that hero, before gearing him up. Yet, that gear changes visuals only, and getting 2 active skills pretty easy task, so we can say: there is no shop at all and no progression. Now about achievements — all heroes have the same types of them, so if you gonna play some hero for a long time, you will get lots of nice bonuses, but have to repeat it it for every one else. Anyway, they wount change game flow even a bit, they exist just to exist.\n\nRight now i would not recomend it for solo players or those who seek fun with random people. It also lags a bit on lava levels even on minimum settings, so you have to get better pc then my'n (iCore5 3000Hz, 4gb ram, 2gb video gts 640, windows 7).\n\nAgain — this is good game and i LIKE it, but right now its not ready to take a place in our heart.

The community in gauntlet is great, the game is pretty fun and can be played local, online and local/online mixed co-op which gives it a thumbs up from me, and the endless mode is great fun. It's ultimately the greatest nostalgia party game in my opinion for 20-40 year olds (even older or younger it doesn't discriminate). I remommend getting a party of your friends who enjoyed it as children with you and doing a local co-op game together for the best experience.\nI do have some cons however, nothing that can really be helped though. The Story mode is fun however not incredibly replayable and quite short, the game is quite buggy and wb will not be updating the game and/or making a sequel ever as production has finished according to forums I have been on regarding it. Add to this playing by yourself is actually terrible for some strange reason (perhaps the loneliness) I would reccomend 2-4 players.\nDespite this I have had an enjoyable time playing and would rate the game an 8.5 out of 10.

Unfortunately it's kind of lacking in content right now, with only 9 exploration level + run-quickly level + spawner arena level sets and 3 boss levels, one after each trio of level sets. Except for replaying on harder difficulties or grinding out achievements for "mastery" rewards, some of which are obnoxious along the lines of "kill 50000 enemies" or "kill 8000/12000 monsters in one specific way", there's not much to do in the game, and it only took me about 5 hours (including some time playing the same levels again with different friends) before I completed the campaign. Probably it'd take about 3 if you just went from start to finish.\n\nUltimately, though, for actually being an online multiplayer remake of Gauntlet I have to recommend Hammerwatch instead.

Those whom were huge fans of the previous games likely wont enjoy this much. However if you were into Magicka you will likely have a great time. The wizard is basically magicka lite.\n\nThe story is there but you kind of have to look for it which really pulls you out of the game. So this game should be avoided if your looking for a story. As for a party game , or a game to be played with friends or even on stream with friends this game will hold its own. It's not a 40-60$ game and therefore you get your monies worth.\n\nHowever it is not the Gauntlet that we all deserve. It is still however better than that "Thing" we call Sacred 3. However Sacred 3 is  more of an rpg than this. You do no character building. There is no loot. Super limited on upgrades and most of which requires high difficulty play to even unlock.\n\nThere are 4 characters / classes in the game. Warrior, Archer, Valkyrie, Wizard. The Wizard is a combo based spell caster. Adding different elements creates a different spell. It has more playstyle than anyone else and was very obviously inspired by Magicka, hence the Magicka LITE comment earlier.\n\nThe Archer is the most mobile class and seemed to do a decent amount of aoe. The biggest thing you noticed is that you can actually move and attack which is extremely important when playing on higher difficulties. However as an archer you have a harder time destroying the monster spawners.\n\nThe Warrior is a barbarian. Wielding an axe you chop like the best of em. Pretty generic, Decent survivablity but playing on harder difficulties ... is well... Hard as a melee oriented class.  This is definitely the class that at best is meant for killing monster spawners.\n\nThen there is the Valkyrie. The tank. The Paladin... The avenger.... Yea , thats right. I said Avenger. She throws her shield like Captain America. She is pretty beefy, Can do a decent amount of aoe at melee and at range.  Most importantly. She has a block. She is the best at survival. Can fight at melee or ranged.   She is kind of a tank anyway. She has a shield and can block but takes a lot of damage. Use of all of the tools is required to play her.\n\nI stuck with the Archer while my co-op partner played a Valkyrie and then later swapped to Wizard. We played through the first door with no issues. However on the first floor of the second door we encountered a game HALTERING bug. Where the key we picked up did not actually acknwledge that we picked it up. However it was no longer in the game world and we could no longer progress. That was the stopping point for me. Once you hit a game breaking bug that rings bells.\n\nThe Drastik Measure gives this game a 6/10","September 23, 2014","false","7.0"," 26 of 47 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","26","47","0","4"

Yep\nNow that's out of the way - there's a few very odd design decisions.\n\nIn putting in the ubiquitous levelling up, story, background and achievements, they've missed something of the original and the sequels - its "open world" feel. All of the dungeons are built to a very specific standard and focus you tightly down the next "surprise". Even if that's not explained to you what the surprise is - three times I had to return to the hub purely because I'd not done what the designer expected me to.\n\nIt feels very much like a 2010 game in that all of your choices are made for you and drilled in from the start. There's no discovery curve as sort, just a line of achievements that act as little red ticks from the teacher.\n\nSaying that, it's still fun - all of the characters have a different style, the key sound is there - but it's definitely lost some of its charm. DEATH is now an enviromental hazard, Ghosts are now missiles of a sort; and it's set around Boss Monsters rather than Hordes - like every other game.\n\n7/10 - Treading the same old path rather than creating a new style.\n\nminus another point until they fix issues like swapping characters between games, swapping screen size and swapping keyboard controls.

The gameplay has just enough to it to keep it interesting in ways other than just a simple 8-way shooter, while remaining comfortably familiar to anyone that's ever played the classic Gauntlet games.  With friends, it's a fabulous romp that's well worth the admission fee.\n\nHowever... How did anyone miss the glaring obvious "Elf can run AND shoot" imbalance?  The usual "the other classes have different strengths" argument will come out, which might be true, but the elf can run, attack AND still be picking up all the gold while every other class has to choose between fighting and looting.   Unfortunately, with the end level 'scores' active, it is a poor thing to have as wildly an imbalancing play option as that.\n\nHopefully it will improve, because right now I'm not pleased with the open multiplayer balance.  Any competent Elf (that plays selfishly, as the game seems to intend) will make every other player feel like their time spent playing was wasted.  That's a real shame on this otherwise good game.\n\nIf you play solo, or with a group of cool people on regular occasions, then consider this a recommended game. Otherwise...

Between the original and Gauntlet: Dark Legacy I put many many cherished hours into these games.  They were difficult and intricate.  The one thing they lacked was a significant difference between the characters.  This game has that--which I like--I never understood why every character had ranged attacks in previous installments.  That's all it has over the older Gauntlets.  The warrior is purely melee (and the worst class), the Valkyre is primarily melee with limited ranged attacks (and is the second worst class), and the wizard and archer are ranged powerhouses.\nIt took just a few hours to beat the game solo on normal difficulty.\nThere's no real leveling system, just gold to be spent on either gear (whose availability is dependant on what levels you've beaten on what difficulty, plus you have to pay for them) or Relics (which are not unique to your character).\nIt's kind of fun, and I'm still waiting for my friends to install their copies so I can try three or four player mode, but it's not worth the price tag of $15 or $20.","September 26, 2014","false","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterClash/recommended/258970/","MisterClash","Mister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterClash/","9 products in account","TLDR: Highly recommended, good fun in single player or multiplayer and ok for people who get motion sick from fps or moba style games.\n\nIf you're thinking of getting this game, first thing I suggest you do is look at some gameplay on youtube. I have an indepth overview and review with gameplay here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQe6N-Bjjfo (hour long) and Zerohill has an awesome 20 video playlist you can see here https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLEg-yDRmLEZ1F0zYiE14ciggS71YnssXX\n\nThe aim of the game\n\nMorak the magician created the gauntlet for power & got trapped inside. Your job is to fight through hordes or mummies, walking dead, undead, skeletons, grunts, orcs, etc., to bring him 3 shards of a sword so he can escape the gauntlet. In return he promises riches & power.\n\nThe Characters, their weapons & attacking skills\n\nThor (Warrior): Carries a battle axe and does large sweeping slashes which lay waste to the enemy. Can also do a double handed vertical chop (think log splitting). And when in a bind, a spinning attack which decimates the hordes around him. And can do a charge to barge the enemy out of the way.\n\nThyra (Valkyrie): Has a Shield, sword and speer. For close quarter combat she slashes with her sword. When the enemies are nearby she can throw her shield (Capt America style) and take out groups or lines of enemies. And she has a speer thrust which can also take out a line of enemy fast, as well as get her out of a swarming group. She also has a shield block which reflects projectiles back at the enemy who threw them at her and protects her from the slashes of sharp fingernailed attackers. She can move while she has the shield up, although slower.\n\nQuestor (Elf): He has a bow and arrow and an elf bomb which he can drop on the ground or attach to his snipe arrows. His normal arrows are rapid fire and short range. His snipe shot is longer range and has more power but isn't as rapid. Use the snipe/bomb arrow to shoot into a Summoning stone from afar - or single enemy troop and the troops around will blow up. His elf bomb can also be dropped into the middle of a horde to blow them up. For quick escapes he has a tumble roll.\n\nMerlin (Wizard): He has 9 basic spells to choose from... Close quarter ice (freezes enemy in place), Ice beam (think laser beam) and Ice lob bomb (which creates a frozen circle which slows down the enemy. Fire balls (not as rapid as elf arrows but do more damage), fire lob bomb and can move quickly as a couple of snaking fireball things. Chain lightening, a force blast which knocks over the enemy and a force shield he and others can stand in.\n\nLillith (Necromancer): An add on character which can be purchased seperately to the game itself, her stock standard weapons are a small skeleton which rises to swipe the enemy a distance from her and a large skeleton with a sledge hammer that bashes down on groups of enemy or large items. As she takes out an enemy she gains some of their Soul Energy which she can use to raise a small group of fighters to help her.\n\nWeapon Abilities\n\nEach character can change their main weapon to give it slightly different abilities. E.g. choose a different bow and the elf's bomb becomes a "keep enemy in place" bomb and allows you to then kill them while they stand still. His normal arrows are not changed when this bow is used. The warrior can change his axe so that the double handed log splitting chop wipes out all the enemies around him in one blow. Valkyrie and Wiz also have different abilities.\n\nTalismans\n\nThese change what happens when a potion is used. At the beginning the use of a potion simply blows it up and damages anything in the blast zone. Later they can be changed E.g. One use for the Valkyries becomes creating 3 valks to fight for her. Each character's Taslisman change is different.\n\nRelics\n\nTheses are items you can buy in the game (with gold earned in the game) to enhance your character's abilties. Some enable you to move faster, others create a whirlwind around you. One creates illusions of your character which can attack the enemy along side you.\n\nQ&A - Answering unasked questions and bad review claims\n\nBad review claim: The game lacks content.\n\nMy take: Without any elaboration in what way it lacks content, the statement isn't helpful and says more about the reviewer than the game. The game has 30 missions in Campaign mode, which can be played on Easy, Normal or Hard, so it is kind of like 90 different missions. Each can be played with one of four main characters for a total possible 360 possible different mission experiences. Add to this the Endless option which has you go through an endless number of floors which are made up on the fly - and can be done solo or with others. The top players have reached floor 8,192!!! And then there is the Colleseum which pits you against waves of beasties in a one room arena - 6 waves completes the mission and each day there is a new mission with different gameplay in a new arena. I wouldn't call that "lack of content".\n\nBad review claim: Only 6 to 8 hrs of game play.\n\nMy take: At the time of this review I have over 140 hrs of game time. I only have 30 of 46 achievements, have not completed the campaign fully by myself in Normal or Hard mode in any single character. Have only managed to get to floor 79 in Endless mode with a team of people (only managed floor 8 by myself as elf) and have completed only two missions in the Colesseum. Makes me wonder if those who think "only 6 to 8 hours" actually tried or just rode along in easy mode multiplayer until the campaign was done and then called it quits, or just found the game too hard. Because with all the achievements, character upgrades and missions, there is no way it can all be done in only 6 to 8 hours.\n\nBad review claim: Boring.\n\nAgain, without elaboration the statement is meaninless. Boring compared to what? Would they find the classic games like Space Invaders or Pacman or Donkey Kong boring? Millions of people around the globe used to go out of their way to play those games in "pinball parlors". There is so much which can be done in this game, any claim it is boring, says more about the reviewer than the game itself.\n\nI have a sneaky feeling the "lacks content", "only a few hours game play" and "boring" reviewers are most likely young kids. Maybe it's boring because their mates won't play with them, because maybe their mates think fps is the shiznits and everything else is boring? And I can see "kids" completing a room in easy mode and considerig it "done" without going back there ever in any other character or harder mode. Or the game is too hard for them so instead of admitting they find it too hard, blame the game for lack of content, not long in hours or boring.\n\nFact is, the graphics are good, the game play is progressively harder (something all good games have in common), it can be played in a mode that suits your skill level and is great for people who suffer video game motion sickness. It can be played on your own whenever you want to spend a few minutes playing, or played with friends or even strangers and can be played in a variety of characters.\n\nYou do not Need to play it in multiplayer. You can play it by yourself in single player mode without interacting with the server and other players. Most of my gameplay is like this as I use the time to get better with the various characters (so I'll be a good asset to any multiplayer team I join) and when I don't have the time to complete the campaign or whatnot with others and want to spend 15 or 30 minutes playing, or just don't feel like playing with others. Playing solo means you can go at your own pace and fully explore each mission in the campaign.\n\nSometimes, depending on the time of day, finding a stranger to play Campaign is difficult. But if you head into Endless more you will Always find someone in there to play with.","May 22","true","166.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

They changed way too much and it has this Torchlight II rip off kind of vibe. Torchlight II is actually way better compared to this. The voiceovers are HORRIBLE. The style is just strange. Not what I was expecting at all!! I feel like it was a waste of my money. Wasn't worth the price at all! It's barely worth $1 in my eyes because it's just not anything like old school Gauntlet. Someone really allowed Gauntlet to be butchered!\nThey need to look back at like Gauntlet Dark Legacy and bring something like that back with a bit of a more modern twist if they'd like and online co-op compatibilities with that. Not this garbage.\nWithin the first few minutes I found out that they basically rigged it where you need others so you can get through it or so you can destroy everything that is breakable OR you have to repeat the same level over and over and over and over and rely on gold.\nThey could have done SOOOO much with this!!!\n1) Death should be the original death that was scared away with potions and took away EXP and health.. Not this instant death crap.\n2) Potions should be useable right away as welllll magic potions!\n3) Loot should only be visible to the player in front of the screen so there isn't any fighting between actual people.\n4) There should be an in game chat for it. I've heard plenty of people complaining about this and I haven't found out for myself yet but I don't think I will anyways.\n5) The coins thing to revive yourself is a neat idea but I think when in co-op mode other players should be able to run over and revive you no matter what even if it's just a small amount of health and when you're playing alone it should more of the coin based thing or else each person should have their own coins but NOOO! They have to share coins to revive... Lame.\n6) They should have gotten better voice actors and actresses!!!\n7) The weapons.. Oh come on... With hoards. I miss the old style Gauntlet where they threw the weapons! Now they don't throw the weapons! So sad!\n8) They should have the level up system like Gauntlet Dark Legacy where the outfit changed as you got stronger and you got a little ally to help out once you reached like lvl 50 or whatever it was! Not this buy your gear bs. It's not even worth it.\n9) There should be more customization to the characters!!!!!

So this new rendition of Gauntlet takes that basic formula and steps it up a notch by giving each hero some new skills that gives it a much more modern hack 'n slash feel. And it works. It manages to hold a nostalgic presence while still feeling refreshingly new. They've added some character level ups to keep it interesting and there is even a difficulty setting if you feel like adding a little more challenge.\n\nThe biggest shortcoming with Gauntlet is the disproportionate skill set when it comes to the Wizard. He has way too many abilities and other cool effects than anyone else, so playing anyone else feels kind of under whelming. The other significant blemish is its short campaign length. The first playthrough is fun and exciting, but it quickly loses luster on subsequent playthroughs.\n\nThe new Gauntlet is indeed fun and best experienced in a full 4-player cooperative, but the game eventually gets stale due to it's short levels and repetitive game play--kind of like the original.","July 8, 2015","true","19.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I've put hundreds of hours into Gauntlet Legends on the N64, and quite a few into Dark Legacy on the gamecube. I had expectations going into this game.\n\nThis is a very different game.\n\nIs it fun? Yes. It's a good game, and it's fun. We'll get that out of the way first. However, it's nothing like classic Gauntlet games. Each of the classes play very differently; they're not just different allocations of stats. As a matter of fact, there really is no notion of "stats" in this game: there's no leveling, no character progression.\n\nThe only difference in a start-game and end-game character is what gear you have equipped - most of which is only for aesthetic purposes. You have 3 important pieces of gear: Your weapon, an accessory that changes what your potions do, and a relic that gives you an extra cooldown-based ability. The only mechanical difference in your weapons is what your special ability does (in the case of the wizard it seems like ability sets rather than a single ability). More expensive weapons don't mean more damage, more range, or anything like that.\n\nLevels in this game vary widely in how long they take. Some only take a couple minutes. Others take up to 10. There also aren't too many levels in the game, and there are only 3 bosses, but all the bosses have very different mechanics.\n\nThe bottom line is that it's a short but sweet game. I have trouble finishing 4 player co-op games with friends due to conflicting schedules and waning interests, but we had no problem sticking this one out.

We started playing and at first nostalgia struck for my friend, but after that it just became the same thing over and over again. To start we ended up beating the entire game on hard difficulty in only a few hours. Every level was pretty much the same design with the same type of monsters with just graphical differences. It was almost like they imported the same monsters same soul stones and just made them look different. The bosses on the other hands were sometimes buggy and not very challenging at all. We found that the first boss we fought was significantly harder than the last one. So far you would think this is a decent game with a few repetetive things that might be a little too easy. But that's not the worst of it. After you build up all yours coins you can buy a few "relics" that really don't do much to help you and usually you forget all about them anyways, but the worst part is that you can spend all your hard earned coins on "Armor and weapons" WHICH ARE PURELY COSMETIC! If they actually had a bonus or made you better. With all that said let's go over the pros and cons once again.\n\nCONS-\nWay too easy unless you're playing the hardest difficulty\nFound some graphical bugs that made me have to restart mid-game\nHardly any puzzles non of which are challenging\nNothing of value to spend your coins on making collecting them kind of pointless\nLazy level design with more of the same things you've already seen with a graphical revamp\n\nPROS-\nA decent co-op experince even if it's too easy\nPretty good graphics all around\nVery Diverse characters and abilities\n\n- CONCLUSION\nI wouldn't recommend buying this game because it does not nearly live up to the hype, but if you are a hardcore Gauntlent fan and really must have it I'd say wait for it to go on sale.","October 29, 2014","false","4.8"," 29 of 54 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","29","54","0","0"

If you enjoyed any of the Gauntlet series you should enjoy this. It stays pretty true to the original concept, whilst bringing enough new things and remastered graphics to make it seem worth another remake.\n\nIf you know nothing of the series (seriously, why?) it's a rampaging dungeon crawler with the very simple aim of kill all the things, collect all the golds and ramp up high scores which obviously improves your e-peen.\n\nIf you're the competitive sort, the leaderboards (both global and friend-based) will add a ton of replayability, and the masteries system gives incentive to play each of the 4 heroes all of which do actually play surprisingly differently.\n\nSome downsides worth noting are that keys aren't currently rebindable (just a simple choice between keyboard or gamepad), and no chat at all. Even just chat in the lobby would be useful when finding random groups on higher difficulties so you can discuss who is prioritizing taking food, or who might shoot it because they've unlocked the masteries etc.\n\nAs with any co-op game you're going to get the best out of this if you have actual friends and a voice chat. If you have no friends like me (sadface), it's a bit RNG whether you get people who are looking to progress in a game, people who are just looking to have fun and work on masteries, or those just out to troll you.\n\nI've still been having a lot of fun playing this single player but I can imagine getting a group of friends together on skype and hitting this up would be awesome.","September 24, 2014","true","6.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

Legends is one of the first quarter-feed games I ever devoted myself to, so when I saw Gauntlet: Slayer Edition, I bought the game without hesitation. Not the best $20 I ever spent. Bearing in mind I wasn't expecting an exact replica of GL, other than the four base characters and the famous "don't shoot the food" rule (though it is incessently drilled into your head every time it happens), I did not find much connection to the classic.\n\nThe game mechanics are simple and easy, which makes for great playability, and the multiplayer factor is has not been lost in this edition; the more, the merrier. Single player is actually quite difficult on its hardest setting due to limited control input and the room to room top-down action (which reminded me more of SmashTV rather than Gauntlet) makes thinning the horde a bit more difficult without the ability to efficiently bottle-neck as you could in GL. Character upgrades are limited only to item purchases (NO LEVEL UP?? IS THIS GAUNTLET??) and is rather unexciting.\n\nAn okay dungeon crawler. Finding a better one to enjoy with friends is not difficult.\nDevoted Gauntlet: Legends fans; walk away.","August 27, 2015","false","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

For the exercise, although it did produce a fairly solid foundation, fact remains that the project is doomed to failure: the classic Gauntlet game just cannot exist in today's world without profound changes.  In keeping its design philosophy close to the now thirty year-old original, Gauntlet by its own definition offers but little replay value.  A paper-thin story is laid on top of enough artifices to make it all seem like a modern game, but the facade quickly shatters away, and the game's true nature is revealed within minutes: room after room of same-y monsters and spawners, lost in a maze with little personality of its own.\n\nGauntlet feels a lot like a proof of concept, more than a genuine full-fledged game, and though Slayer Edition vastly improved on the first version, there is still a lot of work to be done for this to consider itself in any fashion a modern game adapted to today's world.  Right now, for the price, there are much more engrossing games in the same genre out there, with a lot more content and replay value.","September 4, 2015","false","20.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/golfmike/recommended/258970/","golfmike","Golf Mike","http://steamcommunity.com/id/golfmike/","47 products in account","I picked up the 2014 version of Gauntlet. I've given the game 15 hours so far since its release so I believe I can make an honest assessment of game from both the nostalgic (I put at least $300 into the original arcade version) and modern game design and playing perspectives. Keep in mind I play this with a keyboard and mouse (Razer Naga).\n\nThe Good\n\n1. The game play and design are polished with a few exceptions. The game feels like Gauntlet in 2014 and that is a good thing. The same run around, find keys, open doors, get potions, and the characters and narrator are all there from the original. What has changed is the fun factor and a much shorter game. The characters do more, they are flashier and more unique, and they feel solid when played. Questor the Elf definitely has the easiest playstyle, followed by Thyra the Valkyrie, Thor the Warrior, and finally Merlin the Wizard who is definitely the hardest to play.\n\n2. I found myself enjoying Thyra for the best balance of defense and offense. Thyra has great movement, can block any attack (yes any, even the end boss), and has a great offense as well. I suggest for starting players if you want to get into the fray, choose Thyra first.\n\n3. The mastery levels are nice touch and I really like how they build your character up. You have to choose before you go in whether you are going for no deaths or to dying a million times on purpose.\n\n4. $20 is about the perfect price for the game. I can honestly say I am glad I bought it.\n\nThe (Somewhat) Bad\n\n1. Numerous bugs still exist in the game (crashes at times, sound cuts out, visual bugs). Luckily these aren't game-breaking.\n\n2. The camera tries hard to be there for you but currently it leads to more deaths than to give you a clear view of the game. In reality I wish each player had their own screen to look at (e.g. Diablo 3) versus the 3/4-view that traps players.\n\n3. Not being able to check your mastery progression at any time in the game is very annoying. A key to do this needs to be added.\n\n4. Merlin plays too much like Magicka (another Arrowhead product). I programmed my Razer Naga to switch between the nine spells he has and it then became much easier to play. My guess is a lot of other people are going to do the same thing.\n\n5. Cosmetic items are essentially worthless. I'd rather see that you have to buy new gear with better attributes after finishing a difficulty to do better in the harder difficulties than have just a look that nobody cares about.\n\n6. Mastery progression is way too high of a curve at times - it's a ploy for replay value. I do not want to go from 2,000 to 8,000 just for 5% more of an attribute.\n\n7. The game is too short. Normal is completed within 5 hours with a halfway decent team of players. Hopefully Arrowhead now that they have our money have a plan for future content.\n\n8. You are forced into being only one of the four characters. While this mimics the original arcade, in this day and age I shouldn't be forced to play Merlin if I don't want to. Again, this needs to be changed to allow multiple people to live out their Legolas dreams if they wish.\n\nThe Ugly\n\n1. The game has no way to chat with other players so you spend a lot of your time in public games using the emotes to try and cajole other players to go the way they need to go, or for you to move due to the camera getting you stuck.\n\n2. The world leader-board was hacked within one hour of release. Currently there are players hacking to over 1.9 trillion points in single player mode. Arrowhead has yet as of this review to respond to a plan to either secure the boards or (as I've suggested on the Steam forums) remove them entirely until they have a way to fix them.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you are looking for a game that can help you pass some time and is casual, then Gauntlet is definitely the kind of game to lead to a night of fun. If you are looking for something more robust and long-term then this is not the game you are looking for; I would suggest another Action RPG such as Path of Exile or Diablo 3.","September 24, 2014","true","150.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

So, the original arcade-ish experience of learning levels and gaining bonuses to improve has now been... discarded by the developers.

If you ever played the free game "Dead Nation" for the PS - it's that, but with swords & magic.\n\nEnemies swarm you in groups, some are tougher & pose more of a challenge to kill so you need to move around a lot and control the flow of encounters. Timing when to pop your potion, relic or ability can be crucial to not losing control and key-bashing in a panic.\n\nPretty linear design, with a few basic puzzles. There are also a few very dark levels & this is where the game shines, shrouding rooms & hallways in black, as well as any monsters & obstacles.\n\nChoose different characters when you get bored because it can be a bit grindy. They all have varied abilities & play styles, and can suit different roles in the battlefield depending how you deck them out. If boredom persists, nudge up the difficulty. For me, I never really feel like I have 'mastered' any one character, so I guess the challenge (& game longevity) is whatever you make it.\n\nGreat multiplayer support & even has a shared-screen LAN co-op mode from the PS port.","December 27, 2015","true","74.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","3"

Oh right, Gauntlet."\n\nI tend to say that quite a lot, but I wish there were more options than "Yes" and "No" to judge on a game.\nBut alas, that'll have to do. Let's begin with the fact that I believe that one deserves a "Yes" rather than the other choice.\nNow as you probably know if you read some reviews, people tend to be a bit mixed about Gauntlet. I actually hesitated to get it myself due to that fact, but in the end, I don't regret it at all.\n\nLet's get to the actual game before explaining why the feedback is so mixed about Gauntlet Slayer Edition, and why it's justified.\n\nGraphics: The game looks fine, and it's not very demanding. There's nothing spectacular about it as you can judge from the screenshots, but it does its work just fine, for an isometric 3D game. I also highly recommend you to remove the Bloom.\n\nGameplay: that is where the game really shines. In Gauntlet, you progress in dungeons either on your own or with some people, killing skeletons, orcs, demons, whatever. The game also features 3 bosses, which actually end up in a gameplay change and feel refreshing within Gauntlet. They aren't just meatshields. Also the variability in gameplay makes it so that you just end up switching classes every now and then. The game features 4 classes and another one from a DLC. These classes are Warrior, Elf, Valkyrie, Wizard and Necromancer. Pretty much self explanatory, but it's pretty hard to talk about the gameplay without explaining how the classes work a bit further.\n- Warrior: the muscles of the group. He's tanky, uses either a two handed hammer or a two handed axe, he's quite good at dispatching groups of enemies and can make himself invincible for a few seconds with some of his abilities. Useful for destroying those summoning towers, but I'll talk about those later.\n- Elf: this one ain't specialized in strength. He's full on dexterity. Well there are no stats, but you probably get the idea. The elf is a fast moving, ever dodging bow user. He's also able to drop bombs while dodging, which is fantastic to clean up the trash railing up on screen. He's quite feeble though, so you better pay attention.\n- Valkyrie: my personnal favorite. The Valkyrie, despite her name, isn't really made with the use of spears in mind. She's more of a paladin than anything, able to block pretty much everything. You can actually use spears though, but if you want the character to shine, you'll prefer the other sets of weapons. She can either make some huge, single-target damage with her skill, or clean-up everything around her in a 360 degree radius.\n- Wizard: now, that one is quite complex. If you played Magicka, the idea behind the wizard is pretty much the same: using a combination of two elements (either the same of different ones), you can "create" spells. Whatever the case may be, you are limited to 9 spells. Once you have activated a spell, you're "stuck" casting that one until you enter a new combination. Some people are amazing with it, I'm personnaly terrible. Luckilly, there's a weapon that gives a simple spell with a long range that makes him playable even if you don't feel like switching spells.\n- Necromancer: DLC locked, so I wouldn't know but from what I gathered, she's able to summon minions or spirits after charging her ability, which is done by killing mobs.\n\nNow, there's a bit more to it. Which brings us to... items!\nItems / personnalization:\nWhatever you do in Gauntlet, you'll want that damn gold. Also food to restore your health, and potions to... nope. Not restore your health.\nThe potions are used to trigger special abilities for each class. Said abilities you can choose for each class, yet you are limited in your choices in a set of three, unique abilities for each character. Some of them are brilliant like the warrior one who makes him grow huge and unkillable, or the wizard with his huge, undestroyable shield that the whole group can benefit from.\nBut yeah, to choose these abilities, you'll need gold. Luckilly, there's some everywhere in Gauntlet. Once you bought the item, it's yours forevers. But it ain't the only thing. You also get a third skill that you can choose in a more varied list, some of which can summon illusions of yourself that actually do some great damage, or others that charms monsters to fight at your side for a few seconds.\nYou can also choose your armor, helmet and weapon, but you'll still need gold for that. It's not an issue at all, and pretty much makes the reason you're playing the game in the first place.\n\nI could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. The game is quite fun, there's a sense of progression and it plays pretty much like your typical ARPG, although the goal is totally not the same since Gauntlet revolves around arenas.\nSo why am I saying the mixed views are justified? Well, every now and then, you'll probably wonder why you're doing so terrible with a class or cannot beat that boss. Such thinking can bring you to Google quite quickly, and that's the entire problem.\nIf you aren't aware, Gauntlet was a quite different game in the first place. You unlocked "masteries" that were pretty much perks, could personnalize your character a tad more and there was also an "Unfair" difficulty mode after the Hard one.\nFor some obscure reason, the devs suddenly decided to remove like 50% of the game and call it "Slayer Edition". As you probably guessed, the Unfair mode was removed.\nSo whenever you search for something, make sure the item you're looking at is right from the Slayer Edition and not "Gauntlet 2014". After progressing in the game so much, I gotta admit, I for one am ♥♥♥♥ing disappointed by the fact they removed the unfair mode. That actually explains the mixed reviews. Gauntlet Slayer Edition is in no way a bad game. It's just a game constructed on a grave, if that makes any sense to you. Wherever you look, all you see are ghosts of its former glory. Most people were quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off by the decision of the devs, which ended up in negative reviews.\n\nSo yeah. If you feel like the game is gonna please you, go on, play it. But try to ignore the ghosts... I couldn't, which is why I feel so mixed about this game. Alas, I wasn't able to try the "first" version of the game but I still feel like something is missing. The devs also stopped development so don't bother making a ticket if you have any issue with it. :)","February 20","true","43.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","4"

One of the best top-down action games I have ever played. All of the classes are fun to play, especially the wizard. The way you double tap two-button combinations on the controller (XX, YB, etc.) is really smart and is the only real way you could possibly get to each spell quick enough while fighting, because you do need to be able to switch to the right spells at the right time to survive, especially on unfair mode. However it can still get confusing trying to navigate all of his spells (9 total) while being swarmed in combat, especially in unfair mode. One thing that I dislike is that bosses themselves serve no challenge. The difficulty from boss fights comes from being swarmed by other enemies while fighting the bosses. The sounds and music are very memorable, the graphics and art direction are superb, and the effects are also very well done. Probably the only complaint I have is that sometimes in 4 player games there is so much ♥♥♥♥ going on at once that it is very easy to get lost in the action or take hits when you otherwise would not have. Multiplayer is a blast and is one of the most fun games to play online. The more people there are, the harder the difficulty is. So in unfair mode with 4 players get ready for some pain.\n\nAlso, the fact that beating tougher levels on hard/unfair unlocks new gear for looks, not stats, is a joke. It's a top-down game, nobody is going to notice but you. There should be more purposeful rewards for playing through the campaign more than once. Or at least make the gear look better.\n\nI got this when it first came out on Nuuvem (Steam is blocking Nuu vem, are you ♥♥♥♥ing serious) for $13.50 and that was a steal. It has plenty of content to justify its $20 price tag, but don't expect it to be any longer than the average length of a $20 game. If anything, I cannot wait for its inevitable expansions. I mean I hope.\n\n8/10 after 50+ hours it is getting extremely repetitive. It needs a dlc badly.","December 30, 2015","true","58.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is so much more skill and variety than meets the eye. It's one of those games that is easy to get into, but at the same time hard to master. Gauntlet also has great replay value with several weapons on each class, several campaign difficulties and an endless mode. It's a game that is largely based on co-op, but at the same time a game in which there is a huge difference bettween a skilled player and a newbie. Meaning, this is a great co-op game, but also a challeging while not frustraring, at least for the most part, single player game.\n\nIf you're into games that have a lot of replay value, collectibles, take skill and have a rather ''existant'' community, then by all means buy gauntlet.\n\nAll that aside, it's also a fun game to just mess around in with a few buddies on a lazy weekend.\n\nAs a final note, this review is not say that gauntlet is a perfect game. It has its cons, bugs and there are things in the game which may seem ''slightly overpowered'' to newer players and some veterans alike. But when you look past all the non-sense some people claim about class balance issues, there lies a game worth investing time into.\n\nTl;Dr +1\n\n\n\n","October 9, 2015","true","177.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/recommended/258970/","geoluz","GeoLuz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/geoluz/","180 products in account","Gauntlet is a reboot of the 1985 classic arcade game. The 1985 version was memorable for having four characters: Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf. Many people pour quarter after quarter to play this game since it was so addictive. The four characters are back with the same abilities that will remind Gauntlet veterans of what it was like back in the day.\n\nThis game offers modes in single player, multiplayer, and four player co-op. You will have to complete three floors of dungeons in each coliseum to unlock new group of floors. The dungeons are diverse enough and you can accidentally shoot foods like in the original. It does get tedious going through the same dungeons after dying and using up skull coins to get a new life. Once you run out of skull coins you will have to start from the first floor regardless of the floor you were in when you died. So, there are no save points on any floor.\n\nGauntlet also tries to be a little RPG by including Masteries. The Masteries represent the progression of the character you have chosen to play. Believe it or not, dying many times is considered an achievement. Other achievements include taking a lot of damage and using specific moves more than others. It looks to me like the character progression turns out not to be that important since the game is about shooting your way through the dungeons.\n\nThe gameplay is interesting when playing co-op or multiplayer. You can shoot each other by accident with friendly fire and that can cause some interesting friction between the players. The layout of the dungeons contains many cranks that you can turn to be able to advance to other parts of the dungeon. It is necessary to get used to being attacked by packs of monsters. In many cases you will have to destroy shacks that summon the monsters since destroying the shacks is the only way to keep more monsters from coming. Sometimes the sorcerers add to the challenge by regenerating the health of a shack with their staves and it will be up to you to kill the sorcerer before destroying the shack.\n\nThe controls are easy enough to understand: they are as simple as WASD and the mouse. Playing with ranged characters such as the Elf and the Wizard take more practice than playing with characters that fight in close quarters. I think Gauntlet is more fun when playing either multiplayer or co-op than single player.\n\nThe people who experience the original Gauntlet will find this reboot entertaining because of the classic characters and the diverse dungeons. However, if you are a diehard RPG fan looking for deep character customization and progression, you may not like Gauntlet as much as the Gauntlet fans. I think that it is best experienced with other players in multiplayer and co-op modes. The single player mode feels a little boring. This reboot looks better than previous iterations of Gauntlet games that were made after that 1985 original.\n\nMy Score: 7/10\n","July 13, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Where to begin....\n\nGoing into this (maybe I should've done more research) I was expecting something similar to previous gauntlet games, where you crawl through long and unique dungeons, slaying everything in your path.  While they did achieve the 'slaying everything in your path' part, everything else was really lackluster.  And I mean everything.\n\nFirst, after beating the first little section in about 10 minutes, I looked around the main base and saw that there there were only 11 other sections like this.  Which meant that this game wasn't going to be a long one.\n\nHowever, it was pretty fun.  In the post-section report, I saw that after playing a bunch, I could increase some traits for my abilities.  Kind of neat.  Then I saw how little they actually impacted game play.  Sad...\n\nAfter racking up some gold, I went to the shopkeeping dude in the base.  I looked at his wares, to find he has some little trinkets that I could buy and upgrade. Cool! After looking through the 12 or so items, I realized that thats it.  Thats literally all that there is for character advancement.  No levelling.  Just trinkets, and grinding (mediocre at best) skill advancements through gameplay.\n\nFrustrated, I buy some random gargoyle thing and move on.  Diving into all the rest of the sections in this act were all the same.  The first level is always just a single path you run thru and kill stuff.  The 2nd is always an arena-like area.  The 3rd is the boss.  We get to the first boss, hes pretty fun, moderately challenging, an appropriate third boss.\n\nAll the while, I'm just hoping that this game gets better.  My friend and I play through the 2nd act, get to the boss, and its laughably easy.  Seems silly.  Whatever.\n\nFinally, we get to the 3rd act.  I've upgraded my trinkets, they're both pretty bad.  I spend all my time drudging through these dungeons, finding hoards of gold to spend it on a couple of trinkets that I end up never using anyway.\n\nBeat the 3rd boss.  Somewhat interesting boss fight, but then it's game over.  Beat the whole thing in about 3 hours.\n\nThis game isn't worth 20 dollars.  I'd say wait until its on a super sale and pay 5 dollars.  I bought a game called hammerwatch for 5 dollars and have had more enjoyment and more content/gameplay.

In this day and age it's inexcusable to not let us do so. LCD monitors are not meant to be played in sizes other than native, it makes the screen slightly blurry and if you have a monitor like mine it will tell you that every time you start the game.\n\nThe lack of resolution options alone is enough to kill this game but it also has poor voice acting, the close-up models and especially the Valkyrie look terrible (one can argue that she does not need to be the 'uberbabe' she was in previous versions but at least make the close-ups look decent), the keys cannot be rebound which is another bone-headed move, and as you can see I did not play all that much but the dungeon design is limited and uninspired.\n\nGauntlet was one of the best coop games ever made, and the newer versions like legacy were amazing and despite the simple controls and mechanics were a lot of fun and the dungeons were well done and exciting, this game's only real positive is that at least the various abilites you can use are varied by class, although the wizard can be fiddly and he is much like playing magicka.\n\nUnless they patch the resolution at the very least, don't waste your money on this major disappointment.","September 26, 2014","false","0.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Then move along.  There are far better ones out there.\nGauntlet was about frantically running around a maze, fighting off the oncoming hoard of enemies, and trying to seek an exit.  Gauntlet Legends was about exploring stages, over the top attacks, huge bosses, and playing as a chicken.\nNew Gauntlet is about walking around muddy-brown areas that all look the same, getting into one locked arena after another until you reach the end.  Occassionally you have to run from Death and his wonky hit box.  Seriously, though.. all previous Gauntlets are bright, gaudy affairs.  This one is all browns and greys.\n\nMost egregious to me, though, is that the game can't detect my PS2 Dual Shock 2 controller.  That's not that it detects it and won't let me remap buttons, but that the game says "is this a 360 controller? No? Then there is no controller".  Which is a load of crap in the modern world of PC gaming.\n\nAnd while spell slinging as the Wizard can be fun, there's a game out there that can do it better (Magicka).  In fact, any good point I can think of about Gauntlet is done better by another game.","September 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This is Gamer Guy (In a Suit) from the Echo Army YouTube channel! Today I am bringing you a review of the Action/Adventure Classic, Gauntlet. Gauntlet was released onto Steam on September 23, 2015 by Developer Arrowhead Game Studios and Publisher WB Games. The current version is the final version known as, Gauntlet: Slayer Edition\n\n(NOTE: This game was NOT reviewed using a key provided by the Developer and/or Publisher, it was a game I purchased for my own account)\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/AjOpPdu951s\n\nThe "Too Long, Didn't Watch" Review:\n\nOldie but goodie brought to the new era. GREAT Multiplayer fun. Pricey at $20, but often on sale. 4/5\n\nThe "Meat & Potatoes" Review:\n\nChances are, you may be familiar with Gauntlet and don't really need me to run it down. It is at it's best as a 4-player experience, combating waves of enemies as you make your way through the Gauntlet. Classic 80's gaming. Frankly, when this was originally released onto Steam, some people didn't like it. I did, but then I am kind of an old gamer. The Developers worked long and hard and took into consideration a lot of community feedback, and this shows. This is why I wanted to touch on it now. I have been asked quite a few times, recently, about this game. Really, they knocked it out of the park! What we have in the final "Slayer Edition" is a really solid game that would be tough to improve further upon. The solo is the only relatviely "meh" part of the game. Really, it's a fantastic Multiplayer experience. My friends and I play this often, it's one of our go-to's. Pick your lass, and take on the mobs of enemies swarming after you as you make your way through the dungeon. Our favorite is the new Endless mode, where you simply keep going level after level after level until your party falls. the graphics are awesome, and the sounds superb. The voices for the players are a great touch, as is the snarky narration. This is a plus all the way around if you have some buds to play with. It is often available for VERY cheap around the web, particularily Bundle Stars. This is easily a 4/5 with the solo campaign being the only real drag on the overall score. Grab this one on sale, get a 4-pack for you and your friends. You will not regret it.\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 16, 2015","true","15.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/258970/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Gauntlet (Slayer edition) is a modern remake of the classic hack and slash game many people played in arcades and home systems. Besides being 3d, characters now have gear and special abilities that can be purchased with the gold you find in each dungeon. There are also boss fights and “death” makes a return as a nag character in several levels.\n\nMultiplayer is pretty much the reason to own this game and they managed to carry forward the absolutely ruthless competition from the original. You will be sprinting to steal gold and deny food to other players all the while prioritizing your own survival as Gauntlet is more of a competitive co-op game than a friendly one. It’s kind of like playing Monopoly where all your friends end up hating each other by the end of the game.\n\nThe game itself is pretty short and can be completed on normal difficulty in less than 5 hours, leaving the only reason for playing it further to grind for gold to buy all the abilities and cosmetic items. Most useful abilities are very, very expensive which means that during a single playthrough you will be stuck only using a few of them. The dungeons are randomly generated, though, meaning there is at least some replayability to be found. I recommend waiting until the game drops back to it's sale price of around $5 to really get your money's worth.\n","January 25","true","6.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

After you beat this very very short version of a gauntlet title, there isnt much to do but grind to get the random, not so fun achievements and character vanity items.  Gold does little to nothing in this game as its used to buy close to useless "relics" which you might only use once or twice per level IF that, and vanity gear which has no stats. The vanity gear for completing the hardest difficulty doesnt even look the best on most chars. my hours played are 23 at the moment and i litterally can not find anything else fun to do in the game and i feel like the only reason im still playing is to get my $20 worth in hours.  if you are a huge gauntlet fan, you might be slightly dissapointed like we were, its a shame this game is $20.00, its worth $5. you can get more hours out of free games.\n\n","September 26, 2014","false","23.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

However, by today's standards the game doesn't offer much variety. Only a handful of useful items to purchase and not much in the way of character development. This does have the benefit of new players being able to jump right in to play with old players' characters, as a new character can be almost as useful as an old one. The flipside is that character development doesn't offer much incentive to keep playing.\n\nThe campaign is a bit short, I'd estimate it will be over in 6-8 hours, but for 20 Eur it's an okay deal and the harder difficulty levels can extend its lifetime a bit.\n\nThe real meat of the game is the co-op. The more friends you play with, the more fun you have, and although the game itself doesn't offer voice chat, using it is definitely recommended.\n\nAt the time of the release the game seemed a bit unpolished and suffered from some cosmetic bugs (the end level mastery achievement descriptions seemed to have some wonky numbers) and some other small annoyances (enemies get rarely stuck inside obstacles making them difficult to kill, no text or voice chat etc.). Nothing gamebreaking though, and they'll hopefully be fixed in future updates.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn't recommend this for single players, but groups of friends will have a blast.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/258970/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","Between the original on Sega and this one, there hasn't been a great leap in game play development. There will be those who argue with me on this but I feel a lot more could have been done with the environment to make it a more inclusive game for the player. I'm personally not recommending this game but you may find a perks that suit you.\n\nGauntlet is a story of four brave heroes that go into dungeons searching for treasure. They undertake a great task of the gauntlet (onslaught of enemies) in order to achieve their richest of dreams. As players progress through levels, some enemies may simply be hiding behind doors or will keep spawning when obelisks appear. When these obelisks appear, they must be destroyed in order to stop enemies from spawning. There are four classes to choose from. The first is warrior (Thor) who is an up close melee personal type. He has a run charging ability (RT), very effective in close combat with his basic attack (X), heavy attack (Y) and his special (that needs to charge every time after use) attack can be triggered with (B). He has fourth bars of health and can take the most damage of any class. The Valkyrie (Thyra) class has the same controls (less brute force, more speed) but her special launches her shield at opponents. Additionally, the player can use her shield with the right stick to block attacks. Her health consists of only three bars. The wizard class (Merlin) has a vast amount of abilities to choose from (nine to be exact). By combining ice, fire and electricity the player can go nuts with a wide range of attacks. Some include ice "kamehameha", fireball bomb drops and a big electrical ball thing that can shock a bunch of opponents. Some spells will take some time to charge up but other spells can be used in the mean time. The archer (Questor) is able to fire multiple arrows at one time. He is also able to roll through enemies without harm and it's recharge time is a lot quicker compared to other class abilities. Questor has a charge shot available that will deal more damage as his attacks do not do a significant amount. There is also a DLC character available but I really think it should have been included in the original game. I find it ridiculous they are charging for an extra character (especially for the games price). The classes are given a decent amount of varying attacks but I find a lot more could have been done to make the player more excited to play those classes. In other words, more attack variances would have been appreciated as it would combat repetitiveness of the game. The variety of enemies is decent at best as some enemies will have you on your toes trying to defeat them. Loot in game shows up in reasonable amounts but if your low on life, it's sometimes hard to get back into the game. You'll be playing a lot more defensive (especially with more players) as health isn't a significant resource in the game. Not only that, your fighting with 3 other people to get it. There are barrels of explosives available to displace or destroy in order to defeat enemies but the game doesn't go over and above that when it comes to breakable objects. Sure you can break a vase and even break your own food. Unfortunately, no walls or rails can be broken with force. The maps themselves are alright and they really try to keep the player engaged with floor traps or jump beacons. Sooner or later though, you'll find yourself struggling to keep playing.\n\nThe graphics are decent to say the least and the sounds are alright. Players may taunt in game and use some dialogue to communicate to their fellow player to hurry up. Dialogue isn't exactly diverse but you'll hear the players pipe in once in a while. The head guy in charge of the Gauntlet will also chime in once a while with his corny jokes.\n\nOverall, if you're a hardcore Gauntlet fan you may like it (or may like it for the fact you played in on Sega). I personally find this game too much of a grind and if I'm not playing with friends, it isn't exactly fun. Even when I do play with friends, we don't often play past a level.\n\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\n\nScreenShots :\nMerlin is using his ice beam while the necromancer is reviving dead enemies","January 24","false","2.0"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","11","20","2","4"

(Playing with a group makes it 10x better.)\n\nThis new iteration of gauntlet holds true to the legacy of the series, and overall is a very satisfying addition to the gauntlet family that all fans of the game can enjoy.  Character classes are unique from one another and have distinctive abilities which make cooperative play that much more engaging when a team really coordinates well.\n\nThe only slight downside I'll note, is that the game can feel rather short. With only a handful of zones, each with 5 levels a piece, a capable party can crush their way through the normal campaign in a relatively quick timeframe, with the only option for continued play being to kick the difficulty up a notch and start over again.

I finally picked it up and played for about 2 hours and was done. This is the EXACT same game that sacred 3 is. We shunned Sacred 3 for being boring and dropping no loot and the like but this game gets a pass!? I can't wait until developers stop catering to peoples nostalgia and actually make something new. You can take an old franchise and breath new life into it, look at Tomb Raider.\nThis game starts off assuming you've played the older games and has the whole " I'm not gonna tell you what this does. " mentality that plagues a lot of games lately so they can say they're not holding your hand. I remember just having a good time when I played the older ones, nothing was rocket science it was just good ol hack and slash. Then I played the wizard for a smash and was just like Why!? Why does his mechanics have to be so wierd and complicated!? Also I get that the co-op is the shining force of the game, but that doesn't mean people don't ever play single player. If you do play single player the game does not scale for single player it just throws huge waves at you until they can get one hit( which translates to about 3-4 hits because you get bounced around like a ping pong ball) while your trying to take down these shrines, almost mocking you and laughing because your friends were'nt around at the time.\nYour character is not very nimble either as the move I thought was supposed to atleast get you out of sticky situations has a second and a half start up and goes about six feet in front of you (I'm looking at you Valkyrie) so what's the point? I got tired of the reaper mechanic after the first time I saw it. It's not a very hard mechanic to deal with it's just an annoyance like someone sticking the tip of a feather in your ear every couple of seconds. Another negative is the fact that EVERYTHING DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPETITION! The game goes out of it's way to not let you play who want in a multiplayer game with starngers, which I could over look I guess if it fits the story and all. So why am I fighting everyone for gold and food? This is not fun at all. I want to fight with you not against you, if I wanted to fight against you I would play STREET FIGHTER!\nThis game does have some good things about. The sound is top notch and makes the combat feel good and hefty. The characters all play very different which is very good. Also...That's all I got. You can't get 1080p either. Basically this game falls victim to the same ol crap. Developers made a game to tickle your nostalgia, thought to themselves that frustration means challenge and does absolutley nothing new. If your one of those gamers that think everything was better way back when and has a nice thick pair of rose-tinted glasses on your night stand then this game is for you, but if you were looking for a rebooted game from the past that was going to BUILD from the the classic itself then no..no I can't reccomend this game at all.","September 24, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I bought this expecting Guantlet Dark Legacy. What I got was Guantlet: Magika Edition.\n\nHonestly, I don't have any problem with Magika but the fact that this game has absolutely no stat system just ruins it. It's sad attempt at creating some sort of replay value or reward system is just a ridiculously long grind. For example, as a Barbarian I need to kill 20,000 mummies in order to do +10% more damage to mummies. Or I need to take 200,000 points of damage to have an increased HP regen when dropped below 30%. This is not leveling. If I wanted to play a grindy game, there are hundreds of others. If I wanted to play Magika, I would play Magika.\n\nLiterally every room you enter follows the following formula:\n1. Kill 3 or 4 mobs.\n2. Tomb spawns.\n3. 2nd Tomb spawns.\n4. Kill both Tombs.\n5. Get key\n6. Open up wall.\n7. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nAdditionally, there is a "death" level every 2nd act where all you do is constantly run away from a being that will instantly slay you. If they wanted to make a game that was similar to Guantlet, why not just remake the damned Guantly Dark Legacy on the n64? I'm almost certain that is what "most" of us wanted. Overall, I wouldn't say that the game is not fun, however, I will say it was not what I expected, nor what I wanted. This game has a total of 7 maybe 8 hours of gameplay with a friend or two. It had the potential to be so much more but it isn't.","September 24, 2014","false","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you were a Gauntlet fan, you'll enjoy this one imo. If you have no idea what Gauntlet is about, it's basically the precursor to games like Diablo. Or you could look at it as a simpler version of Diablo, with simpler RPG elements.

I bought this expecting Guantlet Dark Legacy. What I got was Guantlet: Magika Edition.\n\nHonestly, I don't have any problem with Magika but the fact that this game has absolutely no stat system just ruins it. It's sad attempt at creating some sort of replay value or reward system is just a ridiculously long grind. For example, as a Barbarian I need to kill 20,000 mummies in order to do +10% more damage to mummies. Or I need to take 200,000 points of damage to have an increased HP regen when dropped below 30%. This is not leveling. If I wanted to play a grindy game, there are hundreds of others. If I wanted to play Magika, I would play Magika.\n\nLiterally every room you enter follows the following formula:\n1. Kill 3 or 4 mobs.\n2. Tomb spawns.\n3. 2nd Tomb spawns.\n4. Kill both Tombs.\n5. Get key\n6. Open up wall.\n7. Rinse and Repeat.\n\nAdditionally, there is a "death" level every 2nd act where all you do is constantly run away from a being that will instantly slay you. If they wanted to make a game that was similar to Guantlet, why not just remake the damned Guantly Dark Legacy on the n64? I'm almost certain that is what "most" of us wanted. Overall, I wouldn't say that the game is not fun, however, I will say it was not what I expected, nor what I wanted. This game has a total of 7 maybe 8 hours of gameplay with a friend or two. It had the potential to be so much more but it isn't.","September 24, 2014","false","8.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

UX part of graphic design was not a priority apparently - a lot of objects do not suggest their interactivity, like some explosives.\nthe shared loot system works as long as you play with your friends only.\nthe title screen suggest Gauntlet is best played with gamepad. however, playing with gamepad is somewhat handicapped since there's no crosshair in this mode.\nfinally, the "story" is rudimentary, the music is boring and the voice acting is unremarkable.\n\nhowever, I still recommend to play this game, as it features really fast-paced thought-out gameplay, with a number of diverse classes for any spinal cord reaction level. the only thing is that class system doesn't offer big rewards for your skill. you could faceroll as a warrior with much less buttons to achieve twice the wizard's result. necromancer is also very strong, since it's a dlc character.\n\nthere is a room and possibilites for teamwork, however it's not required to complete the campaign on normal.\n\neach class features an upgrade system, which potentially can offer a wide range of gameplay styles along with high replayability.\n\ntl;dr a few fun hours of gameplay to spend with your friends.","September 20, 2015","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

With 9 titles exisiting dating way back to 1985 I felt I needed to experience this title which dated back through the decades.\nNow this iteration of the game, as is customary with the other 9 games in the series (or so the wikipedia page tells me), is a hack'n'slash, dungeon crawler. A formula that I somewhat enjoy, having played things like Torchlight as well as Path of Exile, alongside several other games.\nIn this title there are a four different classes to choose from, including a warrior (bashy bashy type class), a valkyrie (sort of like the warrior but with a Captain America-like shield which can be thrown), an Elf (who can shoot stuff and throw bombs) and finally a wizard (who has a range of spells and I've also spent most the time playing). Their skills sets are all fairly versatile ranging from the mere axe swinging antics of the warrior to room clearing fireballs with the wizard. You can also buy upgrades for each class by collecting enough gold in each dungeon level. These upgrades range from several relics, which all classes can use, and vary from radial freezing abilities to summoning gargoyles to fight with you. Alongside the relics you can also buy new weapons which grant your character different abilities, class dependant of course. And of course you can buy cosmetic items to change the look of your class. Do you feel the wizard isn't Gandalf-y enough for you? Buy him a pointy hat. Or is the warrior too scantily clad for your tastes? Then buy him some armour. Each class has about three different cosmetic options for both the head and the body. Armours, hoods, capes and hats. Take your pick. You can also unlock capes by beating numerous waves of enemies in the colosseum, which I tell you now is no easy feat.\nOverall I'd say this latest iteration of Gauntlet has many of the elements that dungeon crawling, hack'n'slash titles have and need. If you've played the other Gauntlet titles or have played titles such as Torchlight or Diablo etc this is definitley worth a look.

Just awful.  I can not recall the last time I have played such a shallow game.  As soon as you start the game you can see that from the starting hub area there are three areas to pick from that open up over the course of the game.  Three. That's it.  This was almost like having the developers at Arrowhead Games slap me in the face, bend me over the original Guantlet™ arcade cabnet, and start brutally ♥♥♥♥♥♥ my ♥♥♥, spiting on me when done and then emptying my wallet which contained $20.00 and running off into the night.  Seeing this beginning hub room was as like having the developers say "LOOK YOU ♥♥♥♥, LOOK HOW SHORT THIS GAME IS! AND THAT IT! THATS ALL THE CONTENT.  ITS LIKE 5 HOURS LONG AND YOU PAYED FOR THIS! AHAHAHAH".  This game made me feel like a prisoner at times, only playing the game so I could get steam trading cards and acheivements and basically just be done with it since it was short.  This game made me feel like I was being held in a concentration camp and the Nazis where Arrow Head games.  Thats right Arrowhead games are basically Nazis and Gauntlet is Auschwitz.  By the way when you beat the game the final boss is shown in a shity concept art painting screaming "ARRRGGGGGG!" and thats it. Credits roll and the game ends.  As a quick side note its worth noting that I fatal error-ed once right at the end of a level, got stuck on collision boxes and one of my friends fell below a level and died, never to re-spawn again until we got to the next level.  Great game!  What a god awful Diablo, tryhard, short, uninteresting, unreplayable, bad looking, glitchy, unfunny, badly voice acted, piece of ape ♥♥♥♥.  In short this is a game, and you can play it, most of the time, I pushed keys on my keyboard which created actions, movements, animations and attacks my character in the game would preform, so at its basic level it functioned, but so did Auschwitz.

For me my favorite still after playing gauntlet 2014 is gauntlet dark legacy. The shear amount of characters that dark legacy had and the numerous levels that you could go thru were a treat and i still havent played as all the characters to this day. With that said i was setting my hopes for this game to be somewhat like that and well it isnt at all they feel completely different. Gauntlet 2014 is still a blast to play with friends. The problems being not that many levels but you get what you paid for here there is definitly 20$ worth of value in this game. Back in 2002 i believe i bought dark legacy for 39.99$ and if u compare the games they were worth the price tenfold. Gauntlet 2014 brings a new feature where you can choose your armor and runes which kinda act like skills but serve a better use for the potions then in previous gauntlets. The biggest problem i have with this game is only having four characters and having them color locked like why cant i be a red wizard or a green warrior that was one corner that shouldnt and didnt have to been cut. After spending about 5 hours with gauntlet 2014 i found myself and my friends wanting to go play dark legacy more than what was right in front of our face. Gauntlet 2014 is still a treat with freinds and if uve never played gauntlet before than this is a great buy but if you have fond memories of the older gauntlets u might be better having your friends over and enjoying whats been with us for the last 15 years. In the end Gauntlet 2014 is its own game and is fun with friends. if you and your friends are looking for a game to play that is cheap you cant go wrong and thats why i give this game a 7/10","October 8, 2014","true","17.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It doesn't feel clunky, and enemies are predictable but not boring. Each class is bound to fit your playstyle in some way. Even though when compared to Gauntlet Legends, each character doesn't have quite the array of abilities and items to use, this version of Gauntlet makes it work.\n\nAs far as the story goes, don't expect much. The story of Gauntlet isn't really one that matters all too much to the game, and there isn't much there. The character's personalities come out a bit in the banter between them at level starts, which is entertaining.\n\nGauntlet's worth picking up, and dropping a 4-pack for you and your friends. It's bound to bring a lot of fun and tense moments (especially on unfair mode).","October 12, 2014","true","38.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The problem is the lack of levels, there are 3 types of arenas each with 3 floors and a boss floor, this gives you just 9 levels and 3 boss fights.  This issue was sort of addressed in the last update adding a colosseum mode where you can battle waves of enemies for new rewards. They also added a new character which cost 5$ to unlock, now this seems like a slap in the face, that's 1/4 of the games price for an extra character.  For a game with such a small amount of cntent it should have been free but I could have justified paying 1-2$ for it but not 5$.\n\nCons aside this game does provide a good time especially if you have friends to play it with.  This game is all about co-op, it even has couch co-op which was a huge plus for me.  Each character has unique abilities and masteries which makes playing as each character fun and different in some way.  The masteries for each character are what give this game it's replayability factor.  Completing the masteries make your character stronger which make earning the rewards from higher difficulties that much easier.\n\nIf your expecting something like Gauntlet Legacy you will be disappointed, but if your looking for a classic arcade style Gauntlet to play with friends then this is the game for you.  I personally don't think that it's worth the 20$ price tag, so I would recommend waiting for a sale.","January 10, 2015","true","19.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Now, with that out of the way let me begin:\n\nI freaking LOVE this game! I am so glad I've found this beautiful little gem. I simply adore this style of game and takes me right back to my youth.\nThe choice of classes (of which there are 5 at time of writing) are simple yet diverse and upgradable. It has everything a dungeon crawler should have: Monsters, boss's, xp gain and loot. The graphics are nicely done and the soundtrack adds to the atmosphere.\nOne highlight of this game is its replayability. Each difficulty adds to the game and the more you do the more chance of acquiring those all important achievements.\n\nIf you're a fan of Isometric, hack 'n' slash ARPG games then you simply MUST buy this game! You owe it to the developers but more than that you owe it to yourself.\n\nTo think that Gauntlet came out a little over four months ago the devs have been busy, adding a new class to the game and a Colosseum mode which pitches you against wave after wave of enemies. This is a game that will keep on giving. If this new iteration of Gauntlet eventually includes all content from previous Gauntlet games then the future of our modern Gauntlet looks very promising indeed.

For that price, it was worth it.\n\nThe controls are very tight. The graphics are very well done. Multiplayer 'just works'. There aren't a ton of people playing, but enough to find most game types at any hour of the day.\n\nThere is a bit of a grind...when you beat levels you get to keep the gold you picked up. This also drives competitive gold stealing between players which, surprisingly, adds to the game instead of makes it more frustrating.\n\nWith your gold you can buy and upgrade a few basic items. Those items do not do anything other than some special power which can only be used if you have potions -- which only exist for the stage you collect them on (stages consist of several levels, four stages to each major act, three major acts make up the entire story of the game). For that reason, the items are very useful -- but not everyone even needs them. One guy with a highly upgraded lute can use all the potions you find as effectively as splitting it up between the players.\n\nThere are also some 'level ups' you get which seem more like achievements than levels. They are different for each of the five characters. They consist of things like, kill x number of creatures with a certain attack, die x number of times, lose x amount of health, collect x gold, etc. They grant that specific character special passive abilities such as doing more damage, having shorter cooldowns, etc. However -- the benefits are slight...2% here 5% there...what makes a player able to handle the hardest difficulty mode is more to do with player skill than anything else.\n\nAll said and done, the game feels much shorter and less grindy than previous Gauntlet titles -- but the controls are WAY nicer and the graphics and animations are of a much higher quality than any prior gauntlet I've ever played.\n\nIt makes for a fun 'pick up and play' casual arcade game that is fun for shorter periods of time. It has more replayability than I expected for having so few levels, but even so, there really are very few levels.\n\nThankfully, the replayability comes from trying to perfect your handling of your character. And each of the five characters do seem to play rather differently and are pretty well balanced.\n\nThe Elf is good at sniping, bombing large groups of mobs and roll dodging.\nThe Valkyrie has a powerful shield and some dash and shield throw abilities that make her good at quick skirmish attacks.\nThe Barbarian is able to charge and do some larger AOE attacks and kick more butt with melee.\nThe Wizard is challenging, as you have to memorize 9 different key combinations to switch to the appropriate spell at any given moment. If you screw up, he can die very quickly as he doesn't have a 'basic attack.' That being said, he's incredibly powerful if played correctly.\nAnd Lilith (some kind of necromancer) can only be played if you bought the expansion which costs about as much as the base game. She seems to have some fantastic abilities that seem poached from the other 4 classes along with the ability to summon a bunch of undead as meat shields.\n\nOne tactic I found very useful is with Lilith and the Wizard. Lilith gets into a corner near a monster spawner and summons undead. The mage teleports behind the undead wall and then casts frost beam at the spawner. Frost beam does more damage the longer it is active and since you won't have to run away because you've got a nice meat shield you knock down spawners very quickly.\n\nFor ~$6 this game is worth it. The lack of levels and content is a big negative. No user created levels was a mistake as Gauntlet is supposed to have a billion levels...and this would have been a way to do it. This is a shame because the graphics, and fluid controls of the game means it has a very solid base to build from.","January 1, 2015","true","13.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Do not play this game if you are going to use the matchmaking system. Its decent, the system works ish. But there is no Communication  chat/voice at all in this game. Which is sorta cool feeling, but doesnt work out.\n\nIf you play with some friends LAN style, or over a Voice chat, you will have endless fun. I have been setting World records with me 2 friends non-stop, feel free to check out some of my screenshots if you need to.\n\nThe characters dont feel very deep at first, but the way the leveling up works...is weird but feels ok in the long run. You get some talents by playing naturally that add just the right amount of depth to make it feel balanced. Characters feel sorta balanced, Warrior might be a little subpar. Either way, if you're playing with friends you will have fun. Wizard is Hard but good. Valk seems great. I play archer, i love it.\n\nMastery level you get just by dieing or killing.

There are some very minor content requests, such as my friends wanting to be a boy Valkyr, but nothing too vital to the actual gameplay itself. This game is and always will be worth the $20. The way they add seperate stats to each and every character, allowing for a great gameplay session is astounding! One of the most unique things about this game is (And I am saying this with a VERY bad computer.) it nearly never lags. Another very good aspect of this brilliantly crafted game is how you can play with other people, without being on the same network (In otherwords, being limited to LAN multiplayer.) Though the storyline is a bit vague, the game alltogether is amazing. I would recomed this to everyone, saying it is amazing, and worth its cost. 10/10.","March 10, 2015","true","85.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There were usually lots of people around to join in on the fun, but for whatever reason this one just didn't hold the nostalgic trip I was looking for.  Don't get me wrong though.  If you're into gauntlet you definitely need to check this title out.  GREAT fun for some couch co-op when you have friends over.\n\nThere's LOTS of in game achievements to grab for each of the characters it provides.  There's bosses throughout and an end game boss too.  I found the Elf to be the easiest character to play as.  He's quick and ranged which helps with the mass amount of enemies charging your direction.  I only played the Slayer Edition so I can't comment on pre-2.0, but I've heard version 1.0 was a lot better and many people miss it.\n\nThere's 30ish stages to play through and it does have online mp and couch coop.  It'll take roughly 6 hours to beat solo with one play through, but once again the coop is where it's at.  Grab it on sale.

You will not be disappointed.\n\nIt feels very much like the classic Gauntlet games in that it has plenty of enemies, spawners, food that is needed badly, and so forth.  However it's also a highly tactical game that rewards creative play.  Each of the classes plays quite differently and skill with any of them can let you completely dominate enemies.\n\nThis is one my favorite games for both couch coop and over-the-Internet coop and everything inbetween thanks to drop-in/drop-out multiplayer and with the endless dungeon mode there's no reason to stop playing.","April 10","true","19.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Even if you dont know it, it's fun to pick up and play with friends. Not complicated but can be tricky or hard at times, takes a bit of skill, knowledge and teamwork. The ways to kill your allies on  accident or purpose is fun. Shooting food is mean but if someone is being a weenie and you kill their food, well maybe they wont act like a twinkie anymore. Extra fun if you got 3 other friends but the matchmaking works VERY well you're in a game of your similar level very quickly and you can learn a lot by playing with new people. It's on sale, buy it, heck, buy the 4 pack and ask some friends if they'd be interested in playing.\n\nThis game for sure plays better on a controller.

As you go through the game, you will constantly find yourself in self-sealing mini-arena rooms that suddenly spawn monster generators, spamming you with low-level mobs from multiple sides that can be taken out in 1 or 2 hits, and throwing a few medium or high-powered threats in with the swarms of cannon-fodder attackers. The rooms will remain locked tight until all the mobs and generators are destroyed, and only then can you proceed. In between clearing the rooms, you'll pick up treasure, food, and potions which fuel your purchased relic power-ups. The rooms, in any of the three worlds, will all look and feel very similar to each other with little variations. The pattern of kiting around the enemies, using speed to lead them into manageable groupings, and then taking them out when you have the tactical advantage will remain constant throughout the whole game.\n\nEven the cheesy, smarmy dialog between your character and the dungeon controller is similar to SmashTV.\n\nAnd, its fun... its actually a LOT of fun...\n\n... but its not Gauntlet.\n\nClassic Gauntlet, at its core, has just one simple game mechanic: Control the pacing.\n\nFrom the second you pressed start, your life force was a timer. Enemies reduced your time. Death drained your time. Traps stole some time and stunned you in place for a few precious seconds. The mazes, shifting walls, and teleporters all disoriented and frustratingly led you down the wrong paths, eating up time. The destrucible walls forced you to spend time to get through them. Hidden objects in plain-looking walls made you trade time for their advantages. Doors that led to only treasure made you spend your time in looting. Being "It" drew the monsters to you, devouring time. Special potions and abilities either assisted or made things more difficult, costing you those few seconds to decide if they were worth the time. Food replenished just a little time.\n\nEvery new dungeon level had all of the monster generators in place at the start, pumping out mobs every second, and you had to manipulate the swarms by shooting, hand-to-hand battling, sniping through corners, absorbing the damage, or evading past them if it was advantageous... all to get to the exit with as much time as possible left in your life-force, and then do it again, and again, and again until the game was over in a pile of bones and keys.\n\n... and this new game has absolutely NONE of that in it. There is no sense of urgency, and very little to push your pace faster than you care to go.\n\nYour life bar never drains on its own. You can take 2-5 hits before dying. Food will fill the life bar toward its maximum, but no further.\n\nYou can kite and circle your foes for as long as you want, in fact its to your advantage to do so as killing multiple mobs in continual succession gives you a bonus to your Kill-Streak, which helps to build up points toward Skull-Tokens, your Continues.\n\nExploring is somewhat pointless... there are no secret walls that aren't visibly marked with cracks and nearby convenient barrels for blasting them open.\n\nThere is just the somewhat direct path through the dungeon levels with pre-scripted encounters in arena rooms, with just enough keys to make it through the level you are on, and no random encounters to speak of. Major swarms of enemies can't really wander out of their areas because the generators don't appear until you enter the room and trigger the encounter, so your ability to use choke-points and the dungeon layout is limited, at best.\n\nThis game is GREAT and a LOT of fun at what it really is... SmashTV dressed up to look and feel like Gauntlet.\n\n... its just not Gauntlet.\n\n(Incidentally, Devs?... SmashTV dressed up to look like SmashTV with this game engine at its core?

The makers of Magicka, that ridiculous game of mages keying in button commands and blowing each other up and sometimes blowing enemies up ply their craft at Gauntlet, the age old and yawn-inducingly simple arcade game of throwing swords at hordes of monsters and hopefully not the food.\n\nThis SHOULD be utter mindless drivel. Worthy of laughs when played with friends and not much else.\n\nBut it simply is not. This Gauntlet has taken the concept of wading into a dungeon filled with thousands of enemies and honed it, tightened it into something beautiful. Hacking, slashing, charging, shooting, blasting, it all feels great, it feels tactical. All four (Plus one quite fun DLC character) characters have their own movesets and each of them play quite differently. Even when all you need to do is mash the attack button you always have a game of footsies to play with the enemies to avoid being surrounded, and you always have at least one or two brutally satisfying moves to whip out. The elf drops bombs and charges sniper shots. The warrior's heavy attack is best used sparingly, but his tazmanian devil spin does double duty to save him from tight spots and to just feel cool as you turn a bunch of enemies into red mist. The valkyrie's lance attack hits with brutally satisfying force. The elf tumbles, drops bombs, charges up power arrows, and can even fire bomb arrows. And the wizard... oh boy. He plays Magicka lite and, if you can memorize about a half dozen spell inputs, you can control the game. Freezing, fireballs, flaming dashes. He is not my thing, but it is always nice to have him.\n\nThis is a real action game. Satisfying hits, enemies with windup attacks that must be dodged and dealt with. It's perfectly fun solo and even more fun with the game's breezy drop in drop out online coop. Just open your game to the world and you will pick up people signing up to play with you as you explore.\n\nThe game itself is short, but replayable. Three difficulties, a colosseum mode for straight up combat. Each character has a perk tree that is only fed by grind, but beyond the easy early perks, very few provide a noticeable effect on gameplay. And the game itself is just fun to play. It invites just picking up every now and again and bashing some monsters, alone, with friends, or with random partners online.\n\nI wish I had not been so skeptical of Gauntlet when it released. Every preconception I had suggested that this game would never and could never be as good as it was. This one is truly a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe DLC character is worth paying for too, if only as a backup to avoid joining a 3 man game with only your weakest character available to play.","March 25, 2015","true","19.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FarginNoob/recommended/258970/","FarginNoob","Fargin Noob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FarginNoob/","595 products in account","This is modern Gauntlet. You could call it a remake, but it's not really that. It's so much better. It's a dungeon crawler and arena twin-stick shooter. It's Gauntlet on steroids, but it hasn't lost that old-school charm. Best played with others, especially when you get into Hard and above.\n\nThe biggest flaws I've seen are a lack of variation on encounters. This was a chance for the team to take Gauntlet even farther, but they stuck with something more tried and true. Granted, it's been refined so that the annoyances of a generation ago aren't still here. There's also a new relic system to give you some sense of progression other than making it through the dungeon. But at it's core, it's the same sets of encounters over and over again, and when you've seen them once, you've seen them.\n\nMy other big gripe is that the loadouts do nothing but change how your character is dressed. Certainly they could have given some other bonus, especially with some of them requiring you beat certain levels on specific difficulties. At the very least, they could have made the loadouts be more visually interesting, because right now, they're a bit boring. I'm not really interested in spending my hard-earned gold on them for such little gain.\n\nThat doesn't make the game not great though. The normal campaign will last you about 6-8 hours depending on your abilities and that's not bad. Add in additional difficulty levels and you've got a competent remake. The added charm of the announcer quipping about Warrior needing food, badly, or the food being shot by the clever wizard harken back to the game we all know and love.\n\nThe story is a bit drab and predictable, but you're not here for the story, so who gives a ♥♥♥♥? The visuals are great, the sound and music fit the game perfectly, and the difficulty scales well. All-in-all, the Arrowhead team has done a great job!

Dodge traps, discover secret rooms, gain new spells and armor through a shop at the main hub, and more.\n\nThis game definitely has some flaws.  The video settings are a bit lacking.  Also my computer has a hard time running it in certain areas, even though it doesn't look like a very demanding game.  However my enjoyment of the game has surpassed my annoyance of any problems it has, and I am hoping they are working hard to fix them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FarginNoob/recommended/258970/","FarginNoob","Fargin Noob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FarginNoob/","595 products in account","This is modern Gauntlet. You could call it a remake, but it's not really that. It's so much better. It's a dungeon crawler and arena twin-stick shooter. It's Gauntlet on steroids, but it hasn't lost that old-school charm. Best played with others, especially when you get into Hard and above.\n\nThe biggest flaws I've seen are a lack of variation on encounters. This was a chance for the team to take Gauntlet even farther, but they stuck with something more tried and true. Granted, it's been refined so that the annoyances of a generation ago aren't still here. There's also a new relic system to give you some sense of progression other than making it through the dungeon. But at it's core, it's the same sets of encounters over and over again, and when you've seen them once, you've seen them.\n\nMy other big gripe is that the loadouts do nothing but change how your character is dressed. Certainly they could have given some other bonus, especially with some of them requiring you beat certain levels on specific difficulties. At the very least, they could have made the loadouts be more visually interesting, because right now, they're a bit boring. I'm not really interested in spending my hard-earned gold on them for such little gain.\n\nThat doesn't make the game not great though. The normal campaign will last you about 6-8 hours depending on your abilities and that's not bad. Add in additional difficulty levels and you've got a competent remake. The added charm of the announcer quipping about Warrior needing food, badly, or the food being shot by the clever wizard harken back to the game we all know and love.\n\nThe story is a bit drab and predictable, but you're not here for the story, so who gives a ♥♥♥♥? The visuals are great, the sound and music fit the game perfectly, and the difficulty scales well. All-in-all, the Arrowhead team has done a great job!

Because there's a competitive aspect to it when it comes to scoring. Gold pickups are shared, everything else isn't. In fact, you can pretty much pull all sorts of ♥♥♥♥ery like hogging the food and potions, destroying the food, triggering environmental hazards perhaps out of spite for that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who got you to drop the crown. The crown is pretty inconsequential, it just adds to your score at the end of a level and gives everyone something to brag about.\n\nYou get skull coins for killing special mobs, and it's these skull coins that count as your "continue coin" whenever somebody dies. It's shared among the party so once they're all used up, anyone who dies gets a much longer respawn timer (at least in normal difficulty).\n\nMuch of the levels involve very simple puzzles and killing lots of monsters. You'll have to work together to destroy spawners but also kill the monster while someone else kites them around.\n\nPotions are limited use items that let you activate one of two relics you've equipped which are special abilities. You can activate them via LB or RB (Xbox controller) but the game doesn't really teach you this at the start.\n\nThe equipment are all cosmetic, but masteries are like achievements that give you passive bonuses as you rank them up. Ranking them up involve all sorts of things like doing certain amounts of damage, killing a number of monsters, using skills, even dying.\n\nAs of launch week, there is a glaring omission of drop-in/out multiplayer (you can only join at the lobby at the very start), needs somewhat better matchmaking (I kept getting an AFK game host, couldn't find any other games), simple in-game chat or voice would be nice, but I understand why it needed to be left out because you really never know what you're getting into with public groups.\n\nTL;DR Solid dungeon coop, ♥♥♥♥ with your friends indirectly.

That all looked exactly alike except for the color to match the classes.\nAfter a year they dropped support, because ♥♥♥♥ the player base, amirite?\n\n\n\nThe developers begrudingly worked on this title after release, then WB reminded them that they had to release it for PS4, and then proceded to take an axe to and already dying game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/recommended/258970/","arborday","arbor day","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arborday/","595 products in account","As you can see, I recommend this game, but it comes with a few caveats.\n\nIf you're wanting an experience similar to the classic Gauntlet games, or even like the newer 3D versions like Dark Legacy, this is probably not the game you're looking for. You want to go look at Hammerwatch instead. Trust me.\n\nThat's not to say this is a bad game, but it has a lot of short comings, and many gameplay elements of Gauntlet have been dropped, some new ones added, and it just doesn't really feel like the Gauntlet I grew up with. Which to be fair, is one of my favorite games of all time. Both the classic versions and the 3D ones.\n\nDungeon floors aren't randomized, and while I know this wasn't a feature in the other games in this series, in the current game market this just feels lazy. I'm already getting sick of running the same (very few) levels over and over with the only change being which character I play as. Secrets and the like are also mysteriously lacking.\n\nWe might as well talk about those characters, actually. Each one plays differently, and not just in regard to how they attack or what skills they use. They fundamentally control different from each other. The Wizard, for instance, mixes two elements together to create one of a number of spells. The Elf plays similar to a twin stick shooter character, akin to Smash TV or Beat Hazard. The Warrior and Valkyrie are kind of similar, but the Valkyrie has the ability to tank, and defend the party with her shield.\n\nShe's also very overpowered compared to the other characters (in my opinion at least) once you learn to use her effectively. A lot of people don't even play her as a tank, and instead spear rush nonstop, which does a lot of damage very quickly. This makes it easy to lead a game in points from having a really high kill score compared to the other players. This is especially true if they haven't learned how to use their character yet.\n\nEach character also has a set of challenges that come with them, which unlock little passive buffs when you complete them. Kill 2000 mummies, get +10% damage against them. Things like this. Progress is not shared across characters, so if you have been mainly playing as one class, then join a multiplayer game where that class is already taken, you'll be missing all the unlocked bonuses for that character, as well as any relics they have bought.\n\nThere are a couple minor bugs and AI quirks (enemies can't walk under bridges that are on a higher level than them?), but nothing that is a huge issue. I've only had one instance of the game bugging out and putting me in a state where I could not progress because of a gate not opening as it should have.\n\nIt's a co-op game, but not really. What I mean is that it is in your best interest (even if it's not the parties best interest) to hog everything for yourself, let other people die so you can steal the gold they drop, and generally act like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to people you don't know.  While I really don't have a problem with the game allowing that, it has never been how I played Gauntlet with my friends. You always do a lot better if you work as a damn team, even if your score won't be as high from being selfish.\n\nJoining online games is a real chore, and it usually takes me upwards of ten attempts before it finally joins a game without either giving me a timeout error or saying the game is already full.\n\nThere's no way to communicate with the other players, outside of four nearly useless emotes that are mapped to the D-pad.  Maybe this was the intent, but when I can just shift+tab to talk to the people via Steam's built in chat, this just feels like an oversight and creates an extra step (and one that takes me out of the game) to offer advice. The biggest problem with not being able to communicate, to me at least, is that it is really bothersome to try to figure out which level everyone wants to do when starting a multiplayer game.\n\nAgain, this isn't a bad game, but if you really want something like Gauntlet, go pick up Hammerwatch instead. Otherwise, I'd really wait for a sale for this one.","October 6, 2014","true","13.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The leveling system - gone, no more yellow wizard has leveled up. And no leveling up to 1-99. your the same level all the time.\n\n2. Game is way shorter then the version from 1998, if anything it should have been longer. can be beaten in less then 3 hours alone.\n\n3. Uncreative level design, no different worlds , just doors with numbers. Plus most levels looked alike to me, either it was in a dark cave or in hell is seemed. What happened to like, Mountain, Castle, Town, Cathedral,  Battlefield, and the Underworld.  And having to travel to get there.\n\n4.  Not being able to make yourself stronger sucks, you have to buy relics that you can't even use unless you find a potion. and all the armor/weapon upgrades are just for show. ruining any reason for me to play the game again. meaning ZERO replay value to me.\n\n5. This game honestly looks like a not free version of Crimson Alliance, except Crimson Alliance it better in everyway. Making it, in my opinion a ripe off of that game.\n\nI had such high hopes for this game and i felt they really dropped the ball on this one. I was really looking forward on my down time to play this game a few hours a week and level up all the classes to see how they played when maxed out. And that will not be happening without a leveling system, making no reason for me to play the game again after i beat it.

It's not trying to be Diablo or any kind of RPG; it's trying to be a modern-day Gauntlet. And it's doing so remarkably well. The four characters all play in a distinctly unique fashion -- far more so than in the original game -- and in local co-op in particular it's just a joy to crawl some dungeons together, battling over the loot, the crown and the inevitable arguments over "who is the best" on the end-level summary screen.\n\nI couldn't say if it would be quite so fun in single-player as I haven't tried it as of the writing of this review, but if you have at least one friend willing to fight alongside you, I can happily give this a solid recommendation.","October 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Only major downside i can think of is that i beat it in 6 hours and the final boss was rather underwhelming.\n\nBut the important part: Should you buy it?   That depends, if you want something that's on par with the original Gauntlet or even Dark Legacy in terms of length of gameplay and the amount of levels, number of various classes to try out in each playthrough, you might be dissapointed as there are only the original 4, though theres a new dlc for the necromancer class. If you want something thats very similar to the very original gauntlet but it's replay value relies on completing the same content on harder difficulties sort of like diablo (Though diablo has more class customisation and variation) then you might enjoy this game.\n\nAll in all I had fun with it for the short time it lasted, i don't think i'll be replaying it anytime, unless with a group of friends maybe.

You have four characters, each with their own skills and abilities, and you team up with friends to obliterate huge waves of enemies, all while splitting up (or fighting over) the spoils. The voice acting is very witty and entertaining for all the characters, and each character has "masteries" which you unlock by doing certain things in game, such as killing x amount of a certain monster, or even dying multiple times on a level. These masteries unlock subtle but useful passive abilities on that character, such as slightly increased damage, or a longer spawn protection.\n\nWhile rather linear, this is a great dungeon crawler game, especially with friends.

I played this to death with my friends and this remake does the original justice. Another game from the same era was Smash TV, it involved kiting yourself around avoiding waves of incoming enemy's. There are many similarities between the two games, both involved avoiding zerging waves of enemies which created a high thrill "seat of your pants" gameplay. Gauntlet can be compared to many games including Diablo and other action RPG's though it is still very unique in its style. This was a genre defining game that has never been equalled and without doubt is a must play for all Action RPG fans. I give this remake a 9/10, it is very true to the original and that's what makes it great.\n\nWARNING: This is not a game for those who need Epic L00t as there is none.

If you disagree with my take on the game or if something is factually incorrect, please leave a comment below!\n\nGeneral GameplayGauntlet is a single player or co-op experience!  This tribute to the older games in its lineage reawakens the fun, top-down dungeon crawling, horde-destroying genius of the original games.\n\nThough a bit linear and slightly redundant, Gauntlet is still entertaining in both single and co-op modes.  The Colosseum mode brings together 4 players in classic arcade fashion.\n\nThe achievements in Gauntlet come for both good and bad events, such as collecting gold or dying, and all make your character just a little better.\n\nReplayability\nAs a co-op game with friends, however, Gauntlet's outstanding history shines through and the game becomes fun, amusing, and challenging.\n\nAdditional replayability comes from trying to complete the game and all achievements with all of the character types.  If you're a completionist, you may enjoy trying to get this one done.  Just bring a friend!\n\nGeneral Accessibility\nAccessibility Options\nGauntlet has sound settings controls for master volume, music, effects, and dialogue, as well as captions (subtitles).\n\nWhen you start the game, it goes straight to the main menu, so you can set captions on before any events happen.\n\nFor gamers with mobility issues, Gauntlet's primary controls are game controller, but it works with keyboard and mouse just as well.  All keys can be rebound to suit your needs.\n\nSubtitles & Captions\nCaptions in Gauntlet are great!  Gauntlet is not a very dialogue-rich game, so most of what is said is flavor text, but it all seems to be there.\n\nPros:\n- Captions for characters are colored according to that character's color (green for elf, for example), and captions from the evil mastermind leading the gauntlet are white.\n- Captions are easy to read in large font across the bottom of the screen.\n\nCons:\n- Captions do not indicate who is speaking by name.  Only a *minor* problem because they are colored.\n\nChatting/Communicating\nGauntlet supports in-game chat and colors text according to which character you're playing.\n\n---\nVisit Games Reviews for the Deaf/HoHhttp://steamcommunity.com/groups/gamereviewsforthedeaf","February 17, 2015","true","2.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

However, we all found the game more tedious and annoying than enjoyable.   The reward system in the game makes you want to gouge your eyes out with a dull spoon.   They tie the relics to potions which don't drop frequently enough to make them useful.  You end up "saving" the few you do get to the point where they become useless.   A better system would be that the potions boost the effectiveness of your relics.  The relics if not boosted, would be on some timer.  This would give you the thrill of feeling like you had some nice power to use in tight situations, but not make the game seem too easy.   Having potions to boost the effectiveness would give you the option to save the power until a very tough fight or simply clean house when you had the boost active.\nThe other annoying detail is the destructibility of the healing and relic powering potions.  The tight quarters force you to use your powerful aoe spells to survive.  However, those same spells blow up your only means of a) powering your relics and b) healing yourself.  I found myself driven into a frenzy of madness.  You are slivers away from death, surrounded, and forced to use your only means of defense to blow up enemies and unintentionally, your salvation.   We all gave up before we could finish it since the joy was sucked out of the game with annoying mechanics and a terrible loot / reward system.\n","December 5, 2014","false","8.4"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

The gameplay does resemble the old gauntlet arcade games pretty well, with massive swarms of enemies to hack and cleave through. The problem I have with it is that the multiplayer aspect is so emphasized that it feels like the game was designed on the assumption that you would play it with three friends in a living room. This is bad for two reasons; one: anything at all is fun if you're playing it with your friends around a table of pizza and beer, and two: if that's how the game is intended to be played, why was it even ported to the PC, which is the worst possible platform for party gaming. Add to this a needlessly grindy system of magic upgrades and a selection of cosmetics you will never see in the game that feels like the game was made to be a vehicle for selling microtransactions, and you've got a game with a lot of problems that would still be decent casual game except that the dodging moves for the elf and the valkyrie are not only tricky to aim in the direction you want to actually go, but do not move the character a reliable distance and cause framedrops if you use them when there are a lot of enemies on screen, which is of course the situation in which you would be spamming dodge roll or spear thrust.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/miskatonic/recommended/258970/","miskatonic","Joan Ferguson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/miskatonic/","1163 products in account","I was reasonably interested to hear that a new Gauntlet game was in the pipeline BUT at that stage I didn't know which pipeline it was in. I hoped it wouldn't be coming from the same one which has blurted forth the gaming equivalent of hot, liquid turds in the name of Gauntlet since the 1980's.\n\nIt seems that instead of serving us up complete effluent they have instead managed some kind of plumbing tomfoolery which has resulted in the effluent being mixed with cool, pure water. The resulting fluid can fill a glass but it is possibly not a glass one would choose to drink from.\n\nSome of the benefits of the game...\n\n1) Graphics are nice and (vaguely) evocative of the original game. Nothing looks bad and the game runs well. Everything looks reasonable for an arpg, tbh. Fairly stereotypical but then Gauntlet was pretty much first on the block for this kind of thing. However, there is little to no variation within a dungeon "set", which isn't in line with the original, there are just themed "worlds" which are not unlike the crap we had to munch through with "Gauntlet: Dark Legacy"\n\n2) Multiplayer works well, netcode seems tight. Now that the "cannot connect to Gauntlet online" random messages have ceased thanks to a post release patch, the netcode works well. Compared to something like Magicka which is still, imo, in a broken "online" state, Gauntlet runs perfectly. No real problems to report, no lag issues as such.\n\n3) It's a good game for a little while, especially for fans of the original BUT this only lasts a short time. One of the key factors of the original was that there were a lot of different dungeons pooled randomly from a larger set, many of which could be flipped and changed in ways by the game before they were presented to the player. No two playthroughs would be quite the same. This is not the case in the new version, with only a few levels being occasionally "flipped" but they're very familiar whatever way round you do them after a very few playthroughs.\n\nBAD POINTS\n\n1) Skill trees have been added but instead of making the game something one would return to in order to "level up" items etc we are presented with something that's nothing more than a skin buying interface (buying skins with ingame money does nothing to your character and they are barely visible) and the option to buy "spells" (more on these on point 2). You can collect more than enough money very quickly to buy all of these things. Also, each upgrade is NOT character specific, with only 2 skills being particular to each character. This is nonsense. It just means, basically, that you're endlessly playing the game to unlock more of the same stuff (unlocks do not migrate across characters)\n\n2) Spells are terrible. "Potions" in the original Gauntlet worked as "Smart bombs" which would destroy onscreen monsters, particularly "Death" (More on this explained in point 3) but instead of keeping them the same the developers saw fit to wangle them into some rubbish kind of "Special move" enabling fandango. Preposterous. So, basically, you have to have a potion in your possession to perform your Special move. This means players simply signpost points in levels, grind out enough potions then all just launch the same kind of devastating, battle winning special. This renders the game really boring and, as a direct result of how the game progresses coupled with this stupid idea, the "end of level" bosses actually get progressively easier as the players become more invincible (in chosen situations). It's a really stupid, crappy system. They should have based these Special abilities on kills or a rage meter or something like that and kept potions the same. In the original game, the wizard could clear a screen by firing off a potion, with the other characters doing progressively less damage with them (warrior being least proficient). Potions were more rare, usually, whereas I feel the new version gives too many, with everyone able to just blast out specials by the time you reach the end of a particular dungeon set.\n\n3) Death is rubbish in this game. People who play/played Gauntlet will know what I mean but for the benefit of those not familiar, Death in Gauntlet is a physical character. In the original he would chase the players and steal health unless someone used a potion. Using a potion "killed" him, for the time being. There could be multiple "deaths" on one level, though. They were quite fun and an interesting alternative to ploughing through loads of "nasties". Anyway, "Death" is nothing like that in the new version. Instead of being in the main levels, he gets his own set of levels which really DO NOT WORK. They're not much fun and get old very quick. He appears, chases you for a bit, then disappears. This happens as you're pushed through a linear set of rooms and, yeah, gets old. Death is not remotely troublesome, either, and you can simply run round and round him. He even smashes crates/pots by passing over them so you can use him to collect money. He's basically rubbish in this version of the game, pushed into a sidequest of sorts (which is short and lame YET counts as a "main level")\n\n4) GENERATORS. GENERATORS, FOR CHRISTS SAKES, NOT "SUMMONING STONES". JESUS ! WTF !? The summoning stones are a BAD idea. They even sound rubbish. "GENERATOR" sounds so much more malevolent and directionless. "Summoning stones" take the place of generators in this version of the game but they're a really lame replacement. In the original, Generators were in place in the level anyway. You could see them from far away. In this version you will usually walk into a room, the doors will shut, and a Summoning Stone will appear. From this, enemies will come and you smash them up then smash the stone. Doors open. Proceed. Pretty lame, tbh. There are no "levels" of summoning stone, either, whereas the original game had varying strengths of Generator that spewed various strengths of creature. Also, there were ghost generators in the original game. In this game, ghosts are confined to just appearing on the "death" mini-levels. They just appear in tiny groups, following him. Useless. Gone are the days of masses of monsters (including ghosts, see LEVEL ONE IN THE ORIGINAL GAME FFS) generating and pushing at the backs of doors, instead we get the occasional room that's been "set up" with standing monsters but nothing like the original dungeons, creaking with scum to be destroyed. It's like everything in this game is just waiting for you to turn up before it'll appear, which takes away from the "world of absolute violence" vibe that many so loved about the original. Then again, that might just have been me. I'm asian.\n\n5) This is a SHORT game. It's not got anywhere near the replayability of the original and in a couple of playthroughs (or less) you'll most likely have enough gold to max everything on your (not very unique) character. It's really hurt by not having random levels of the kind offered by stuff like Full Mojo Rampage (and many other such games). With no real need (or, perhaps, desire ?) to replay for more xp and to enjoy some different levels, there's little to return to this game for and we, once again, encounter the same problem that has plagued all of the more modern Gauntlet updates. NOT ENOUGH GAME. Why, when the original paved the way for randomising such a large amount of gameplay elements do we have to put up with this NONSENSE ? We were even promised such things in this version of the game but there is no such thing (99% of the time) here.\n\n6) Price. It's too expensive for what it is and the new character should have been free DLC. The base game doesn't contain a fair few things that were promised and just feels, well, way too short and shallow. It's good fun and the engine is sweet, the characters "play" well and all the new moves are fine but there need to be many more levels to make this worthwhile.\n\n6/10.\n\nI recommend Full Mojo Rampage instead.","December 11, 2014","false","21.8"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","2"

Before I start this review, I have to say that I am not a fan of the original series. Sure, I played a couple of games way back when, then I played games influenced by them, then I got this. I put the game on "Hard" because I'm a real man and played it from start to finish with two friends. All I have to say is, don't buy this game.\n\nIt's competitive aspect falls flat on it's face purely because gold is useless in this game. Players are encouraged to steal relic potions because they are scarce, steal the crown because it effectively doubles your earnings and to generally perform better than their friends in order to get a larger cut of your earnings. With gold you can upgrade your relics, except you don't have to - most of a relic's potential is already available to you from the get-go, besides, you barely get to use relics anyway. You can also spend gold on cosmetic pieces, a grand total of ten per character, excluding pre-order content, that you can barely see because you lose track of your character so often.\n\nThis game is badly optimized, a staple of Arrowhead games since Magicka, even though it's not graphically impressive. There isn't much difference between low and high settings anyway, aside for VSync and FXAA. Because of a generally drab, boring and sterile aesthetic you lose track of your character easily. It's also severely lacking in enemy variety, averaging in five enemy types per zone.\n\nThere are three zones in total, three chapters plus boss each. A chapter typically takes around twenty minutes to complete, and even that is generous. As long as you are not terrible or don't lose time quarelling, you can breeze through the game. There is a separate survival mode, Colosseum, but it's short and it's rewards, three cloaks, aren't very tempting.\n\nAs you can see, I haven't said anything positive yet, because that is of little importance. Sure, the characters were nice, the dialogue was fun, the passive mastery learning system was somewhat interesting, but having all that robbed us of actual ♥♥♥♥ing progression and strategy development. If you are looking for a Gauntlet comeback, I suggest you try Hammerwatch. If you are looking for some co-op action, I suggest you try Hammerwatch, no, I implore you to try Hammerwatch.

The game is a dungeon crawler so that's basically the only environment you encounter which becomes very boring after a while. As this is controller friendly, you loot and pick up items just by walking over them, and don't have to worry about an inventory because there isn't any. Upgrades of your equipment you buy at your local shop for the money you collect while grinding through the levels.\n\nThere is no story at all, so you don't have to make choices or encounter npc's. The game focuses 100% on combat and when you're solo in the game this feels a bit lonely. The graphics aren't that great, the rendering distance is a bit too far. What I like is that you can dodge missiles and make use of your class specific skills. Crossing a dangerous floor is easier as a ranger than a warrior, just because you are quicker. Sound logical but in ARPG that isn't always the case.\n\nFighting is clicking the right buttons. Warrior is the easiest, mage the most difficult as you have to remember button sequences which sounds a bit dated to me. Press this, than this and finally this to cast a spell. Very arcade yes, but hardly modern.\n\nAs a solo player I can't recommend this because it is too boring and bland. There are lots of better action rpg's in the world to devote your time to. As a party game I can imagine it can be fun to play. For a while that is as the variety seems a little low.\n","September 25, 2014","false","1.5"," 15 of 29 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","15","29","0","0"

This will ♥♥♥♥ you off to no end, in the most fun way imaginable! The characters all have their own very unique playstyle and skillset, which makes mastering your own style of play very easy but not intimidating enough to make you soley stick to one character. (Haven't gotten the Necromancer yet, so I don't have any input on him.)\n\nThe Warrior is very well done, and he can definitely deal a ton of damage while staying nimble enough to aovid huge mobs.\n\nThe Valkyrie is fun to use and extremly useful in a pinch when you're playing with 2 or more characters. Though the shield is a bit a awkword to figure out at first. Balancing throwing and blocking takes time.\n\nThe elf is just flawless. While he can't hurt the monster spawner with basic attacks, the bomb arrow more than makes up for that. His ability to roll around and laugh at enemy damage is hilarious.\n\nSaved my personal favourite for last. The mage is extremly fine tuned. With nine spells - including slows, freeze spell, an aoe explosive, a shield, and arcing lightning - The developers had a lot of fun making him. I'll say that trying to remember the element combination (any two combined of fire, lightning, and ice) takes a minute to get the hang of, after that he decimates waves and spawners. It's almost unfair, but he does have a bit of a health handicap. So it evens out.\n\nWould I buy it again? Hell yeah! And another! Maybe another, but that'd be it.

All humor has been removed (which is ok, Gauntlet doesn't need to be funny) but it's replaced with dry attempt at what I can only guess is "wit" written to be understood by a 5 year old. The gameplay is stale, it's your typical button mash dungeon crawler with each class having a "unique" set of attacks. Unfortunately this leads to the final issue of difficulty, there is none.

When it's this version.\n\nThis has more in common with a multi-player version of Diablo than it does with Gauntlet.\n\nI played Gauntlet in the arcades back in the day, when it was new, and eagerly awaited it's release for home computers, including Atari ST and zx spectrum and a few others that were around at the time.  My friends and I enjoyed the conversion and played it for many hours.\n\nThen came Gauntlet 2 and we were excited all over again, especially  when it was released for home enjoyment, and we all spent our waking hours wandering around with different coloured versions of each of the four characters, with Red elf and yellow wizard and blue wizard and green valkyrie, it was a good time had by all without the limitations of one character type availalbe, and often we'd play as four versions of the same character to see how it played.\n\nNow after a few other releases of gauntlet and it's clones over the years on consoles and home computers, we come to this version.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say it's a bad game at all, to expect it to be like either of the first two Gauntlet games is to meet with dissapointment, and it really does have a lot more in common with diablo 1 or 2, and Diablo's spawned children than the golden Gauntlet of happiness that I still remember clearly and dearly.\n\nThere are certain things that tie this title loosely to the Gauntlet of it's title, like 4 characters named after the Gauntlet characters. Food that's fragile and can be destroyed accidentally, and the fact that it all takes place in a dungeon.  Certain sounds and phrases are very similar to the original too.

When it's this version.\n\nThis has more in common with a multi-player version of Diablo than it does with Gauntlet.\n\nI played Gauntlet in the arcades back in the day, when it was new, and eagerly awaited it's release for home computers, including Atari ST and zx spectrum and a few others that were around at the time.  My friends and I enjoyed the conversion and played it for many hours.\n\nThen came Gauntlet 2 and we were excited all over again, especially  when it was released for home enjoyment, and we all spent our waking hours wandering around with different coloured versions of each of the four characters, with Red elf and yellow wizard and blue wizard and green valkyrie, it was a good time had by all without the limitations of one character type availalbe, and often we'd play as four versions of the same character to see how it played.\n\nNow after a few other releases of gauntlet and it's clones over the years on consoles and home computers, we come to this version.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say it's a bad game at all, to expect it to be like either of the first two Gauntlet games is to meet with dissapointment, and it really does have a lot more in common with diablo 1 or 2, and Diablo's spawned children than the golden Gauntlet of happiness that I still remember clearly and dearly.\n\nThere are certain things that tie this title loosely to the Gauntlet of it's title, like 4 characters named after the Gauntlet characters. Food that's fragile and can be destroyed accidentally, and the fact that it all takes place in a dungeon.  Certain sounds and phrases are very similar to the original too.  But that's it for similarity really. Anything else is from Diablo.  There aren't mazes filled with spawners of varying strengths 1-3 (though there are occassional spawners scattered here and there), and there are potions but they are needed to power artifacts which you buy with gold, outside of the levels you play through.

Playing with friends wether online, local or even both is where the meat of the game is. As of this writing I had no problem finding people to p[lay with. It's fun and worth the $20 price.

Then bumping it up to hard I almost didn't notice a difference at first, until I all of a sudden realized I was not winning anymore. So I knew something about making it harder was working but I could not figure out what it was. The game does a really good job and making it hard without making it feel like its impossible.\n\nThen there was Unfair mode, still with that same feeling. I feel as if I can manage to get through the simplified dungeon layouts after learning them on normal mode but instantly get shutdown with in the 4th or 5th room. With time I'm sure I will become better at the game and pick up and make my own techniques for getting past dungeons on Unfair mode.

It's THAT type of couch co-op where you actually have to cooperate.\nWhile single-player seems to be quite well - though a little bit harder for some classes - multi-player is the bomb. Not only it allows local coop, but online works wonderful. And let me tell you - multiplayer is a blast. You get a couple of friends on skype - and you will have hours of non-stop fun.\nAnd itself it's a pretty good game, though some classes seem to be harder to play/master. Levels are nicely decorated, announcer doesn't annoy you, classes are useful in their own way and generally it's enjoyable. Keyboard works fine, though I yet have to try the controller.\nWhile it seems that "Getting 3 shards of whatever" will be pretty quick (the first chapter took 3 of us 2 hours), the replay value is in different classes, because they differ A LOT. Warrior deals massive damage to tours and fat monsters while elf thins out small crowds of weaklings and mage supports with slowdowns and ignitions. And because of this variety everybody plays differently.\n\nI would say it is DEFINITELY worth the money if you have a couple of friends who'll join you.","October 3, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The developers said they want to make the game as close as an experience to the original arcade as possible, but are actually using that as an excuse to avoid programming more. If you are standing at an arcade machine with three of your other friends there's nothing preventing you from using your voice. The game is also unforgiving. Even on easy difficulty you should have at least three people in your party or it will be tough to proceed. Getting more people to join you should be simple, but the developers opted for the archaic "quick join" feature for multiplayer instead of giving players a list of lobbies. This means that you could click quick join and wait for minutes to join a game not knowing whether anyone is actually playing a public game at the difficulty you selected. All of this equals an unsatisfying multiplayer experience unless you know well three other people that all want to play and have the game. $80 for you and three of your friends to play a game where you can't communicate is a bad deal.","November 22, 2014","false","9.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

HOWEVER Solo is still a great experience considering your can choose between your favorite class and level them all up individually and with VERY good difficulty options.\n\nPlaying the game on Normal was great fun. Then bumping it up to hard I almost didn't notice a difference at first, until I all of a sudden realized I was not winning anymore. So I knew something about making it harder was working but I could not figure out what it was. The game does a really good job and making it hard without making it feel like its impossible.\n\nThen there was Unfair mode, still with that same feeling. I feel as if I can manage to get through the simplified dungeon layouts after learning them on normal mode but instantly get shutdown with in the 4th or 5th room. With time I'm sure I will become better at the game and pick up and make my own techniques for getting past dungeons on Unfair mode. I just LOVE how hard the game can get.\n\nA LOT more about this game is great.

The characters each have their own advantages and disadvantages to complement their unique play styles. The game also proved somewhat challenging to beat on unfair difficulty. My only complaints are that it's currently a bit too grindy, requiring you to get over 200,000 kills to complete all of the class's mastery pages. Additionally, the devs have yet to implement random level generation akin to the old arcade-style Gauntlet. Instead, there are only three sections of the game, each is broken into 4 chapters. Three chapters in every set of four contain 3 levels each, the fourth containing the boss fight. Each set of 3 levels is mostly the same: the first always a challenge level with keys, locked doors, and monster summoners, the second always an "escape level" of sorts with a constantly respawning threat (Death, spiders, demons), and the third an arena-style level with monster summoners that takes place in one room. Furthermore, all of the bossfights have the very simplified mechanic of avoiding the boss for a set amount of time until they become vulnerable, then attacking them for about 5 seconds before they become invincible again. Rinse and repeat. Despite these complaints, the game is still a lot of fun to play with friends provided two or more of you didn't want to play the same class. This game is worth it if you can spit the cost of the four pack, but I'd wait for it to go on sale to buy it just for yourself unless you already have people to play it with.","October 2, 2014","true","113.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In order to do so, they decided to go back to the original arcade games from the 1980's and take a few pointer tips for their inspiration of level design.\n\nHowever, instead of endless dungeons that the originals produced, this game focuses on more of a linear storyline.\n\nThree worlds - One Boss per world\nFour levels each -Three stages per level (Explore, Race, Challenge Arena)\nFour difficulties - Easy, Normal, Hard, Unfair\nFour characters to select, five with DLC - Warrior, Knight, Wizard, Elf, & Necromancer\n*Online and Local Co-op with up to three other players!\nDifferent Masteries per character to unlock\n\nGone are the days of treasure chests and a variety of potions to unleash upon the hordes.\nNowadays we are prone to smashing pots and boxes for gold. You do collect a potion throughout the entire game, you use these to display your special ability in combat. Special abilties can be bought at the in-game store and you can have up to two at once.\n\nDifferent skins for your weapon and character are buyable as well, but they are just for looks.\n\nMany complain this game is bland, but it is really just inspired by the "bland-ness" of 1980's retro arcade games. The look and feel is all intentional. If you enjoy that nostalgia, then the price is worth it.\n\nIt is a retro rpg - hack and slash - dungeon crawler.\nYou either love it or you shame it.\n\n8/10","October 6, 2014","true","85.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fortunately I was wrong.   The arcade classic is there - but its in spirit more than form.   There are still hordes of enemies, gates that need to be unlocked, and food to shoot - but they have taken the combat system to the next level, and introduce encounter and boss stages that bring the game onto a much higher level.   Every player has a learning curve - you need to learn how to be effective with them.  The wizard being the hardest.   Once you start to learn your character however, the game is a lot of fun.    I picked up the four-pack of gauntlet and sent it to all of my old gaming friends.  Multiplayer is a blast.   I only wish we could select the same character .. If I recall you could in the original ..  "Red Valkerie is about to die" ...\n\nBefore buying this game I checked a few reviews and critic sites.   I would sum up the feedback of the game as "luke warm" ..   Many people cited glitches and crashes as the main problems.   I'm playing version 1.03 (Patch 3) and neither my friends nor myself have encountered any problems whatsoever thus far.\n\nIf you played the original, Gauntlet II ..  you should love the game and be pleasantly surprised by the additional features.   If you are new to the franchise, then remember that it is a remake of an 80s original - its not trying to emulate any other game but itself ..  be patient with the character learning curve and I'm sure you too will enjoy it!\n\n2012-12-13 UPDATE:  I play this game casually, a bit here and there.  I'm starting to get my character masteries filled out - where you unlock small incremental buffs that accumulate to make you more powerful.  I love the Necromancer update with the Colosseum.  I play this game mostly solo - but when my kids or friends play with me - the game takes on a whole other level.  It scales to the number of players and the boss fights are an absolute blast.  Still unable to select the same character - that sucks  "Blue Wizard is about to die..."","November 9, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The games have been pretty straightforward and enjoyable, and this version of Gauntlet doesn't deviate too far from the formula.  Gauntlet isn't an HD remake of the first game.  It is a modernized retelling, keeping some things but adding in a few new things to change things up---with mixed results.\n\nGauntlet is a decent looking game that plays pretty well.  The game's strongest point is how each character plays.  The four choices (Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf) have relatively unique playstyles.  You'll have to excuse my controller references coming up, but the Warrior and Valkyrie can be most closely associated with "button mashers," relying more on the face buttons to perform commands.  The Wizard and Elf, on the other hand, are "twin-stick" shooters, relying on heavy use of the right analog stick.  Each character also has special abilities to offer further variety, but the most diverse character is the Wizard.  While the other characters are easily accessible, the Wizard has a learning curve due to the number of abilities he has (in comparison to the others).\n\nThe game still stays true to its hack n' slash, dungeon crawling roots.  The game tries to have some kind of story for why the characters are thrust into the Gauntlet, but it is paper-thin---almost unnecessary.  I know we're supposed to be collecting shards for a sword, but I really just wanted to kill some monsters with my friends.  Now, something that makes this game stand apart from other dungeon crawlers is the lack of a leveling system.  Your character doesn't gain levels (they do gain "masteries," but more on this shortly), and is just about fully equiped with every ability they will ever have.  I find this to be a welcome break, and it helps keep the game accessible to anyone.\n\nUnfortunately, I found there to be more negatives than positives to this game.  The game offers up "masteries," which are basically perks that require a lot of investment.  Most of the revolve around killing enemies, but having to continuously play through levels to kill enemies is rather annoying.  If, perhaps, the mastery requirements were lower or if they were shared across all characters (where applicable), I wouldn't be as annoyed with the mechanic.  However, the amount of work and time needed to entirely unlock them isn't worth it, in most cases.  The rewards are so incremental that it makes me wonder why they're there.\n\nSomething that may also help is a stronger level variety.  There are 30 levels in the game.  27 of them are part of 9 "standard" levels and the other 3 are boss levels.  When selecting a non-boss level, you are committed to a three-level endurance run that, despite the aesthetic changes, all follow the same formula: 1st level is a "long, standard" level, 2nd level is a "short, environment hazard" level, and 3rd level is an "arena" fight.  Given that the levels are not procedurally generated (a "hot" item in more recent dungeon crawlers), the replayability falls short.  The bosses aren't incredibly fun to fight either, making them rather underwhelming.\n\nAnother downfall about the level structure is the "hub" area.  After completing either the series of 3 levels or a boss level, all players are transported to the hub area to select a new level or purchase items.  The game offers the players items in the form of relics---which can only be used if potions are collected, or loadouts---which are only cosmetic permutations for the characters.  The relics offer a little more variety to the potions (instead of just "clear the screen of enemies") and the permutations don't hurt the game at all, but relics can never be used on bosses and the loadouts require us to beat the bosses and specific difficulties to unlock (and even then they cost gold to purchase).\n\nThis game also harkens back to the original Gauntlet by restricting the group to one unique character per player.  We cannot all play as Wizards or Warriors in a 4-player group.  I like the idea of having team variety, but forcing it typically leads to a lot of players quitting from a game since they can't play as a character they've invested time into.  However, as with most games, playing this game with more people is always a good time, and with a recent patch text chat has been made available.  On top of the other tweaks that have happened since the game's launch in September, it is apparent that the developer's aren't just letting this game settle.  They plan to keep improving it.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nGraphics aren't terrible; very likely this game will run on anything.\nController support\nEach character has a unique playstyle\nCo-op is fun; online and LAN.\nDevelopers still working out the kinks and making updates.\nCons:\nGame is a bit on the short side.\nNot enough levels, and not enough level variety to keep things interesting.\nCan't have multiple people playing as the same character.\nGame wants you to grind, but not get the benefit of gaining levels.\nRelics and loadouts don't really offer much to the game.\nPoor, and at times laughable voice acting.\nSuggestions:\nStart using procedural level design.  While it isn't a perfect fix, having a structured level design when having to replay levels makes the experience too linear and predictable.\nGet crazier with the boss and level designs.  Maybe have something that requires more teamwork, or include some more variety with the environmental hazards.  Adding puzzles would definitely be a plus.\nAdd an endurance mode.  All levels must be played in succession; no hub area breaks.  Even better: 100 levels, like the original game.\nAllow mutliple people to play as the same character.  The group may not be as varied this way, but I'd rather have another player in the group than have them drop out due to their character being taken already.\nDrop the relics, or make potions transfer from area to area.  Not having relics for boss fights is a poor design choice.\nDrop the loadouts for character creation.  Sure, the characters we play as are fully-voiced characters with small stories.  I'd rather see them not truly be characters but rather avatars for ourselves.  We can customize them, and unlocking these permutations actually unlocks them---no grinding for gold to buy them after unlocking them.\nDrop the masteries, or have them be cumulative across all characters when applicable.  Getting 50,000 kills for one character for a 25% damage output increase is a tall order.  Asking for that for all four characters is ridiculous.  Having shared masteries would also make the transition from playing as one character to another a bit easier on the player.\nDespite my lists of complaints, I am still recommending the game.  I do not think this game has earned my $20 just yet, but perhaps with additional updates down the road it will get even better.  Right now, I'd say the game is worth a $10 purchase.","November 29, 2014","true","99.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The games have been pretty straightforward and enjoyable, and this version of Gauntlet doesn't deviate too far from the formula.  Gauntlet isn't an HD remake of the first game.  It is a modernized retelling, keeping some things but adding in a few new things to change things up---with mixed results.\n\nGauntlet is a decent looking game that plays pretty well.  The game's strongest point is how each character plays.  The four choices (Warrior, Valkyrie, Wizard, and Elf) have relatively unique playstyles.  You'll have to excuse my controller references coming up, but the Warrior and Valkyrie can be most closely associated with "button mashers," relying more on the face buttons to perform commands.  The Wizard and Elf, on the other hand, are "twin-stick" shooters, relying on heavy use of the right analog stick.  Each character also has special abilities to offer further variety, but the most diverse character is the Wizard.  While the other characters are easily accessible, the Wizard has a learning curve due to the number of abilities he has (in comparison to the others).\n\nThe game still stays true to its hack n' slash, dungeon crawling roots.  The game tries to have some kind of story for why the characters are thrust into the Gauntlet, but it is paper-thin---almost unnecessary.  I know we're supposed to be collecting shards for a sword, but I really just wanted to kill some monsters with my friends.  Now, something that makes this game stand apart from other dungeon crawlers is the lack of a leveling system.  Your character doesn't gain levels (they do gain "masteries," but more on this shortly), and is just about fully equiped with every ability they will ever have.  I find this to be a welcome break, and it helps keep the game accessible to anyone.\n\nUnfortunately, I found there to be more negatives than positives to this game.  The game offers up "masteries," which are basically perks that require a lot of investment.  Most of the revolve around killing enemies, but having to continuously play through levels to kill enemies is rather annoying.  If, perhaps, the mastery requirements were lower or if they were shared across all characters (where applicable), I wouldn't be as annoyed with the mechanic.  However, the amount of work and time needed to entirely unlock them isn't worth it, in most cases.  The rewards are so incremental that it makes me wonder why they're there.\n\nSomething that may also help is a stronger level variety.  There are 30 levels in the game.  27 of them are part of 9 "standard" levels and the other 3 are boss levels.  When selecting a non-boss level, you are committed to a three-level endurance run that, despite the aesthetic changes, all follow the same formula: 1st level is a "long, standard" level, 2nd level is a "short, environment hazard" level, and 3rd level is an "arena" fight.  Given that the levels are not procedurally generated (a "hot" item in more recent dungeon crawlers), the replayability falls short.  The bosses aren't incredibly fun to fight either, making them rather underwhelming.\n\nAnother downfall about the level structure is the "hub" area.  After completing either the series of 3 levels or a boss level, all players are transported to the hub area to select a new level or purchase items.  The game offers the players items in the form of relics---which can only be used if potions are collected, or loadouts---which are only cosmetic permutations for the characters.  The relics offer a little more variety to the potions (instead of just "clear the screen of enemies") and the permutations don't hurt the game at all, but relics can never be used on bosses and the loadouts require us to beat the bosses and specific difficulties to unlock (and even then they cost gold to purchase).\n\nThis game also harkens back to the original Gauntlet by restricting the group to one unique character per player.  We cannot all play as Wizards or Warriors in a 4-player group.  I like the idea of having team variety, but forcing it typically leads to a lot of players quitting from a game since they can't play as a character they've invested time into.  However, as with most games, playing this game with more people is always a good time, and with a recent patch text chat has been made available.  On top of the other tweaks that have happened since the game's launch in September, it is apparent that the developer's aren't just letting this game settle.  They plan to keep improving it.\n\nSummary\nPros:\nGraphics aren't terrible; very likely this game will run on anything.\nController support\nEach character has a unique playstyle\nCo-op is fun; online and LAN.\nDevelopers still working out the kinks and making updates.\nCons:\nGame is a bit on the short side.\nNot enough levels, and not enough level variety to keep things interesting.\nCan't have multiple people playing as the same character.\nGame wants you to grind, but not get the benefit of gaining levels.\nRelics and loadouts don't really offer much to the game.\nPoor, and at times laughable voice acting.\nSuggestions:\nStart using procedural level design.  While it isn't a perfect fix, having a structured level design when having to replay levels makes the experience too linear and predictable.\nGet crazier with the boss and level designs.  Maybe have something that requires more teamwork, or include some more variety with the environmental hazards.  Adding puzzles would definitely be a plus.\nAdd an endurance mode.  All levels must be played in succession; no hub area breaks.  Even better: 100 levels, like the original game.\nAllow mutliple people to play as the same character.  The group may not be as varied this way, but I'd rather have another player in the group than have them drop out due to their character being taken already.\nDrop the relics, or make potions transfer from area to area.  Not having relics for boss fights is a poor design choice.\nDrop the loadouts for character creation.  Sure, the characters we play as are fully-voiced characters with small stories.  I'd rather see them not truly be characters but rather avatars for ourselves.  We can customize them, and unlocking these permutations actually unlocks them---no grinding for gold to buy them after unlocking them.\nDrop the masteries, or have them be cumulative across all characters when applicable.  Getting 50,000 kills for one character for a 25% damage output increase is a tall order.  Asking for that for all four characters is ridiculous.  Having shared masteries would also make the transition from playing as one character to another a bit easier on the player.\nDespite my lists of complaints, I am still recommending the game.  I do not think this game has earned my $20 just yet, but perhaps with additional updates down the road it will get even better.  Right now, I'd say the game is worth a $10 purchase.","November 29, 2014","true","99.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I did not see a "skip tutorial" button (my bad if there was but pretty sure there wasn't).\nNot nice forcing people to do something they don't want to, give them the option to choose.\nAnd if you are going to argue that they had to do that the way they did so people would learn about the characters and their mechanics then i say to you: "I'm sorry but I do not agree!"\n\nThere are better ways to introduce important stuff then forcing it on people, hide it like Portal and Portal 2 did - almost the whole game is a tutorial preparing the player for what is to come, but we are not here to talk about Portal, Gauntlet time.\nThe tutorial on its own was put together nicely, introducing the characters and their mechanics through gameplay rather then through text, which is always nice.\n\nThe characters are ok-ish defined.\nThe Warrior being a warrior can take damage as well as dish out damage of his own.\nThe Elf uses range attacks to defeat his enemies, although his range isn't that great. I expected more from an elf ranger.\nThe Valkyrie is a nice mix of the two (i particularly liked the Captain America like shield throw).\nThese three characters are pretty straightforward, but the Wizard is a bit more complicated.\nHaving 9 spells to choose from, the Wizard can access his spells with a certain button combination. The desired spell is then ready to use, assuming its not on cooldown.\nNot too intuitive, and a bit confusing at first but fiddle around with the spell combinations and you will get the hang of it.\n\nI must point out that the ice spells were not as useful to me as the other two types of spells (fire and lightning) and i ended up playing mostly with fire and lightning spells, and even here with not all of them.\n\nThe Fire Bomb is useless if you are near a doorway or a low ceiling-ish area it will hit the ceiling and explode dealing no damage to the monsters below it or it won't end up exploding where you expected it to cause it ended up hitting something you did not thought possible (could be a bug or just bad design).\n\nAlso Lightning Discharge was of no use to me, if i wanted to knock someone back I can use my Storm Barrier, so I ended up using it only when I incorrectly combined buttons to get a spell.\n\nThe RPG elements are kind of wierd in concept and implementation.\nIf you buy armour and weapons you only get a cosmetic change. But you can also buy relics to give you buffs to your speed, damage, attack speed or the ability to summon illusions or a demonic gargoyle to fight by your side.\nHowever you can only have 2 relics and can not use any without potions. These potions you can not buy, they can only be found throughout the levels, as well as food which restores hit points.\n\nInstead of gaining traditional levels for each character, you can only improve your stats by performing achievement-like actions called Masteries. For example killing 10,000 monsters grants a 10 % damage bonus.\n\nFirst time around, the structure of the game is interesting and the level design is a mix of pre-made and randomly generated environment.\nSome levels are more complex than others, tasking you or the group to push blocks, insert statues into spots, or fill a lava pool to raise a bridge and then finally an okay-ish boss battle.\n\nThe campaign is broken up into three acts, with four stages, four repetitive stages.\nEach set of those stages unfolds in the same way:\nFirst you start with a standard level, then you move on to a shorter level with a frustrating twist like being chased by death which btw is bad at its job and its not so hard to outrun (just frustrating) or a dark cave eating away at your nerves as you try to hold back the urge to pluck out your hair and then (as i already mentioned) a boss fight.\n\nHigher difficulty only makes enemies more resistant to damage and drop more gold.\nOnce the campaign is finished there’s not much incentive to revisit and replay the game.\n\nThe A.I. is not to bright either. Getting stuck frequently on each other, corners, doorways and other stuff lying around the level.\nAfter some time you notice how they move and can kite them around the level making them easy targets. Easier than they would have been on their own.\n\nAnd a one last thing, the camera, oh boy ...\nThe view is zoomed out far enough to cover an area, but not far enough for a four player co-op play through. The camera does not follow any player controlled characters but hovers above an area of the level and its easy to lose sight of your character.\nAdditionally if any teammate goes idle you can't move on without them cause the camera will stand still in an area and try to cover all players.\n\nI am sure that Arrowhead did their best but they neither went full retro nor did they break from the past.\nAs i see this game, its like they tried to stay close to the original (Gauntlet from 1985) but not to close cause people my not like it today and tried to make it an appealing 2014 role-play, dungeon crawl, hack and slash game but actually got stuck in the middle of it all resulting in a not so good game.\n\nIn short its repetitive and overly simplistic, awkward camera, an uninteresting upgrade system and too little substance or variety to satisfy players.\nHowever, with four committed players the co-op works well, and it’s certainly not the worst Gauntlet revamp there’s ever been.\n\nAll in all IMHO this game is a 5.5 / 10, nice try but u failed, sry and i do not recommend this game.","January 5, 2015","false","11.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Not only is this game incredibly short but it was very cheaply made with alot of "copy and paste" in the measely 12 levels they give you. The game has literally no storyline, other than some mysterious voice that captured you in the beginning and forces you to fight these levels for him. In the end, it appears he used you to get shards for some sword (that he never explained anything about) and then says "This must be the final test. My final test." and then proceeds to attack you. The battle is easier than the levels and is very short. You get a little bit of dialogue with a total of three pictures ( literal non-moving pictures) for your ending. All in all, I'd say if you really wanna play this pathetic game then wait til it goes on sale for $0.50 or it's free for a weekend(as you can prolly beat it in two hours). Also, there is only one character that is worth playing as (Valkryie) and is incredibly unbalanced with the other players. So, the creators of this game NEVER need to make another game and I would like my money back. Also, I would like to kick them in the balls for ruining one of my favorite games.","December 31, 2014","false","6.6"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HoboCzar/recommended/258970/","HoboCzar","Waiting in the Sky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HoboCzar/","205 products in account","Challenges can be fun. And Gauntlet has the fundamentals of a great challenge: interesting tools for split-second decision making, and difficult encounters that demand you play your very best.\n\nUnfortunately, there are some awful design decisions and sloppy glitches that spoil what would otherwise have been a classic action game.\n\nFirst, the pacing: Gauntlet has historically been a very fast-paced game. But the obstacles in this Gauntlet are often extremely tedious. Monster spawners take ages to destroy, and you'll have to do it over and over again. Once you've found the right strategy, you'll just be repeating that approach every time, while hoping that one of the game's many glitches doesn't ruin your attempt.\n\nAmong these bugs: Enemies will get stuck, invincibly, inside walls; the player character will get stuck in the world; collision detection screws up frequently; attacks will miss enemies directly in front of you; small elevation changes will render abilities useless (God help you if you try to fight on stairs); your defensive skills will sometimes fail to work; and relics can cause your character to lock up.\n\nAny of these glitches can lead to a cheap death, and that often means losing 20+ minutes worth of progress, since the game's rewards are gated behind challenges like "complete three levels in a row on the hardest difficulty without dying once," while your character dies in a split second if you screw up, or the game does.\n\nWhile Gauntlet seems suited for a quick jump-in, jump-out pace, the level structure actually requires completing several very lengthy levels in a row, which gets very tiring, especially when they consist of the same obstacles over and over. The level design itself is poor, with lots of boring, winding paths, thoughtless blob-shaped rooms, and cheap traps. In one of the randomly-selected sections, there's a room that can trap your character by requiring a key to exit yet not including a key anywhere in the room, or any way to backtrack, forcing a restart.\n\nThere are fun elements here, but it's a sloppy product.","January 19, 2015","false","53.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

Brings back memories of ditching Ritchie Ponderosa's roller-skating party to waste $10 in quarters at the arcade there in the 80's. Boy was my mom ♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n\nGreat evolution of the franchise makes the additions a welcome advancement to the series since inception.\n\n/* generic 11/10_lulz review */\n\nShot food, died of hunger. Came back to life on top of spikes and died again instantly. 11/10\n\n/* generic journal_lulz review */\n\n\\Day 1://\nWoke up in a dungeon. Some dude tried to sell me stuff but I had no money. I see a door illuminated with light. I step inside.\n\n\\Day 2://\nStepped into a bigger dungeon. Found lots of gold. What's that? I hear shuffling coming from behind that locked door.  Oh good, I have a key.  Oh, no a swarm of mummies attack.  I kill them all and loot their corpses.  I sure can carry a lot of heavily-weighted gold for one man.\n\nI find a turkey sitting in the old, musty dungeon.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting there.  I say f*** it and eat the turkey anyway.  What's the worst that could happen? I find a doorway that looks like the devil's mouth, so I do what any normal person would do and step inside.\n\n\\Day 3://\nThe turkey is not sitting well at all.  I've pooped my pants and it is running down my leg.  The mummies won't stop and now there are spiders everywhere.  I really don't think I should have eaten that turkey.  I think I'm hallucinating.  I see an apparition appear before me. It is Death, and he is here for me.  I run my ♥♥♥ off trying to get away, but the trail of foul-smelling fecal matter makes it impossible to shake Death. He vanishes from time to time when the smell becomes too much even for him, but he is close on my stinky tail.  I finally manage to find another demon mouth and plunge myself inside of it.\n\nIt couldn't get any worse now, could it?\n\n\\Day 4://\nStuck in a room with never-ending ghouls, ghosts, and other assortments of the creatures of the underworld.  They seem to be coming from some kind of portal. So I blow it up.  When I do, two more take its place.  So I blow them up too.  Pretty soon, all of the creatures fall before my unwielding power and stenchiness. Gold appears from out of nowhere so I pick it all up. I must have over a ton of gold stored on my body somewhere.\n\nMy stomach lurches and makes an inhuman growl. I head for the exit but collapse onto the hard, cold granite floor. The last thing that I hear is my bowels letting loose one final time as the blackness encroaches.\n\n<!--ELF HAS DIED OF DYSENTERY-->\n\n...the moral of the story is never eat a turkey you found in the dungeon.

If you like the preview videos of the gameplay, chances are you'll like the game.\n\nThere is one annoying thing, though. Playing Merlin online. You compete for gold with the other players, and he has, by far, the longest cooldown on his dash ability. This means you're pretty much always getting the least gold. He also has more utility, but he has to use a lot more skills to be on equal ground to other characters. If you like challenges he'll be a great character. Seems to have a few OP abilities, but the cooldown on them is long enough to make him boring for me. But if you don't mind slightly longer cooldowns but a lot more options, maybe he'll be good for you. Just be sure to save that dash for getting gold, if possible (half the time it's not possible). Players are brutal on this game when it comes to gold, but it's all in good fun.\n\n10/10","September 23, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Some problems that need serious improvements are:\n1) The further you get in endless the longer it takes to get to where you were when you start (the checkpoint system/teleporter takes you 19 lvsl at a time).... they could have easily fixed this but never did.\n2) A online game browser would really help as of now all you have is quick join which is often plagued with problems (person can start a game then just leave the game running in the lobby and anyone who tries to join a game will be funneled into that game.. essentially meaning one person can effectively shut down the MP for everyone)\n3) Other little annoyance is you can't change controller mid game if you play one class with the gamepad and the other with keyboard/mouse you have to back all the way out, essentially meaning you can't regroup up with your current group unless you get lucky and quick join takes you back with those people.\n\nLast big problem that I wish they would fix is that the controls can't keep up with how fast you eventualy have to be to survive, this is mostly with the wizard on a keyboard and mouse..  the difficulty ramps up to a point where as fast as you have to 'flick' the element buttons to change spells... even if your skill gets to the point where you can effortlessly change and reload spells fast enough to survive in the higher difficultes (i.e. floor 200+).. after a certain point that is much lower than how difficult the monsters get... many times the buttons won't register if you hit them too quickly... apparently in an effort to protect against cheaters using macroes etc... basically kind of ruins the game.\n\nOverall game is one of the better ones out though today in terms of action /dungeon crawler with 5 really different classes.  Aside from the aforementioned problems its a great game and definitely worth checking out.","August 12, 2015","true","238.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Seriously, if you want an example of a modern *level design* failure - play this. No juice in them at all, only paper.\n\nOther than that you probably gonna have fun at least for the first 4-6 hrs. After that it's more of the 'perfecting the character play' or learning other characters you haven't played yet.\n\nOn high difficulties reminded me of *Alien Swarm* - requires great cooperation, coordinated planning.

It's a tedious, monotonous game with serious design problems. The game recently got polished into Gauntlet: Slayer Edition, but the problems remained.\n\nConclusion: looks good, but not worth of any money. Maybe, if you get it for free, or as a part of humble bundle. Otherwise, no.\n\nRegrettably, this game is not fun to play at all.\n\nAfter 4 to 5 first levels the game starts to repeat itself. First levels are fairly enjoyable, but after that: nothing new. Controlling game characters (4 different + 1 dlc) is not rewarding, because most of the time your character is very hard to spot from the screen. That's because of three of the worst design flaws: walls obstruct your view, the viewpoint (camera) is zoomed out way too far away from your character AND the levels have very few light sources.\n\nPlaying the game makes you wish you had binoculars and a flashlight pointed at the screen.\n\nHow about multiplayer mode? You need a friend for that, because there is never anyone playing multiplayer otherwise. Once you get online with your friend, you will experience even more design flaws. You think you cannot get motion sickness from a game? I dare you to try this one on multiplayer mode. Have a bucket next to you when you try. I mean, what were the devs thinking? On single-player you have to strain your eyes to be able see your tiny character on a dim screen, and on multiplayer mode the screen jumps and jolts around making sure you'll vomit, or at least get a headache.\n\nEven if I pretend I can endure the flaws I mentioned, the boring map design and clearing a floor after a floor from the same enemies over and over again is just not worth the time. It is very sad to give this game thumbs down, because I really loved previous Gauntlet games, such as Gauntlet: Dark Legacy and the original Gauntlet and Gauntlet 2. Yes, even the original Gauntlet is less monotonous than this one. At least the original Gauntlet had proper level design and a feeling of progress in the game.","September 18, 2015","false","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I never played any of the previous Gauntlets so I never felt any nostalgia people wrote in their reviews.  I felt the game had a lot of potential but it fell flat.  The graphics were decent and made the game looked very interesting in the screenshots.  However, the game was extremely repetitive.  You literally grind variations of the same 3 path dungeon 3 times (so you play each path 3 times) then you reach boss.  There is absolutely no replay value.\n\nI played D3 when it first launched and I thought it was fast.  Well, this game is even faster.  However, there is incentive to grind in D3 for better gear.  Here, you grind to level up your skill but really you just get a longer duration or deal more damage with your skill most of the time.\n\nA lot of people said this is a coop game and I imagine this might be the reason.  I played single player and felt the game was really boring the whole time.  The only real replay incentive is if you want to beat at the highest level of difficulty (there are easy, normal, hard and unfair).  I bought this with a discount so it didn't hurt me as much but I rather have spent it on another game now that I know this one is bad.  I really hated the voice acting for the elf.  The voice acting fits a thief character where he sounds a bit sly.  I honestly imagine the best class would be wizard with complex skills... but I really am not interested enough to want to find out.","August 5, 2015","false","13.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkLamberta/recommended/258970/","MarkLamberta","MarkLamberta","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MarkLamberta/","294 products in account","As a player of the original Gauntlet series, this game sucks. It sucks because the attacks are made to be annoying to use and not straight forward(like the previous ones) so that you have to always place your self specificaly or take some kind of time to think about it to actually hit the enemy. Some people may say that I just want a simple minded game, but again, I come from where the previous games had three attacks(melee: activated when you touch an enemy, light/fast: fast weak ranged attack, strong/slow: slow hard hits.) The only person that has some resemblance to the original formula is the sorcerer. Another MAJOR down side is that there is no level system like the previous three. Why would they think that you won't need levels in this? Just the same damage output and input the whole damn game? That turns the whole damn game into a Kiting play(Kiting is when you run away, shoot, and repeat), and kiting is not suited for this kind of game. To all who disagree, I emplore you to go play the originals(not seven sorrows, it sucks. Still better than this though). They replaced leveling with gold, which means that gold will eventually become useless. People could argue that xp eventually becomes useless BUT that takes a much longer time to cap(meaning max level) than to get enough gold for everything, plus experience doesn't have a constant spot on the screen to remind you of it. Again, Just go play Gauntlet Legends or Gauntlet Dark Legacy, and then play this, you will most likely see where I am coming from. This sequel just makes me sad to have seen, to know that they "ruined" it with the designs they chose to go with.\n\nSome may wonder why I have such a low play time, and it is because that is how long it took me to see that I hated this. They shouldn't have called it Gauntlet at all, honestly if they named it anything else, I might have been more lenient in my criticism. I honestly wonder what the developers thought they were doing when they were making these decisions, completely changing the layout of the game.\n\nOf course if you like the game, more power to you, I might even have been able to keep this game if there actually was a leveling system, because I can get past the combat because the combat isn't completely awful. It is only awful when your attacks do the SAME damage for THE WHOLE GAME. I never fought a boss, but I don't doubt that they were actually good. To be fair, previous bosses were kind of just "shoot and hope you kill them before they kill you" kind of things, except usually you would get the secret weapon that hurt them to get a leg up.","September 21, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some design decisions are nonsensical. Networking is atrocious, which makes online play a moot point. Upgrading is slow and takes a long time for no good reasons, and upgrades are incredibly minor in most cases.\n\nThe characters are annoying yet somehow unintentionally funny in how cliche they are. It reminds me strongly of a game that was made way back in the day to spoof Gauntlet, known as Get Medieval. Strangely, each character class does not control best with the same control scheme. Using mokey for the elf is a serious advantage, while using anything but a controller for the other classes is a mistake. The wizard is not playable with mokey, so don't even.\n\nBizarrely when playing online each player must choose a different class. They fixed that ♥♥♥♥ when Gauntlet 2 hit the arcades back in the day, there's no excuse for this complete retardation.\n\nWorth it on sale maybe, but not otherwise.

No thrills to be had there.  So, on to the wizard I go. This character is the complete opposite of the warrior in terms of difficulty.

Swapping spells on the fly is a little cumbersome and was another reason why I spent the majority of the time in fireball mode.\n\nThe gameplay and tactics can be a bit unforgiving.

Came back to life on top of spikes and died again instantly. 11/10\n\n/* generic journal_lulz review */\n\n\\Day 1://\nWoke up in a dungeon. Some dude tried to sell me stuff but I had no money. I see a door illuminated with light. I step inside.\n\n\\Day 2://\nStepped into a bigger dungeon. Found lots of gold. What's that? I hear shuffling coming from behind that locked door.  Oh good, I have a key.  Oh, no a swarm of mummies attack.  I kill them all and loot their corpses.  I sure can carry a lot of heavily-weighted gold for one man.\n\nI find a turkey sitting in the old, musty dungeon.  I have no idea how long it has been sitting there.  I say f*** it and eat the turkey anyway.  What's the worst that could happen? I find a doorway that looks like the devil's mouth, so I do what any normal person would do and step inside.\n\n\\Day 3://\nThe turkey is not sitting well at all.  I've pooped my pants and it is running down my leg.  The mummies won't stop and now there are spiders everywhere.  I really don't think I should have eaten that turkey.  I think I'm hallucinating.  I see an apparition appear before me. It is Death, and he is here for me.  I run my ♥♥♥ off trying to get away, but the trail of foul-smelling fecal matter makes it impossible to shake Death. He vanishes from time to time when the smell becomes too much even for him, but he is close on my stinky tail.  I finally manage to find another demon mouth and plunge myself inside of it.\n\nIt couldn't get any worse now, could it?\n\n\\Day 4://\nStuck in a room with never-ending ghouls, ghosts, and other assortments of the creatures of the underworld.  They seem to be coming from some kind of portal. So I blow it up.  When I do, two more take its place.  So I blow them up too.  Pretty soon, all of the creatures fall before my unwielding power and stenchiness. Gold appears from out of nowhere so I pick it all up. I must have over a ton of gold stored on my body somewhere.\n\nMy stomach lurches and makes an inhuman growl. I head for the exit but collapse onto the hard, cold granite floor. The last thing that I hear is my bowels letting loose one final time as the blackness encroaches.\n\n<!--ELF HAS DIED OF DYSENTERY-->\n\n...the moral of the story is never eat a turkey you found in the dungeon.

The eponymous gauntlet is full of hordes of monsters and you have to destroy them, along with the summoning stones that spawn them, in order to reach the heart of the maze while collecting gold and eating/destroying food along the way. The complications arise around how to complete that straightforward task. The choice between warrior, valkyrie, elf, or wizard consists of more than a set of strengths and weaknesses; each represents a unique playstyle, from hack and slash to twin-stick shooter. It's that variety of tools, not the diversity of problems to solve, that lends the experience its interest. Joyful hours are spent not just killing the small number of unique enemies spread over a miniscule three environment types and learning the rudimentary story which is implied more than actually told, but in finding new and inventive ways to do so. The heart of Gauntlet has little to do with anything other than answering the very arcade-like question of how to reach the exit with your limited number of (skull) coins.","September 11, 2015","true","70.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If you never played a Gauntlet game, imagine Diablo but only the dungeons and caves and none of the open world or towns. Each character has a different play style, the most unique being the wizzard who plays like the game Magicka where you combine spells into different attacks.

It is nothing like the original. The only thing that this game takes from the original is the stupid abililty to destroy food. And the game tries to make it into a joke.

Instead im this stupid valkarie who derps when you attack with your shield up. Because  there is hardly no scaling of the characters, the game is senslessly repetative, boring and infuriating when get through the levels. I couldnt make it past the first set of levels without getting bored. This game just leaves a whole in my heart. I mean, why u no include pojo? I wanted to be a chicken. And The whole trinket or whatever the heck they are, system is kinda stupid. And when I picked up potions I was looking forward to killing some wraith thingys. But no. The potions are sucky like the rest of the game. I would sooner recomend pokemon channel over this piece of trash. The graphics are meh, i mean they are not terrible, but if you are gonna have a sucky game then atleast make it a pretty piece of crap.

I do  however have far too many gripes to warrant this\n\nThe Good:\n\n- Great sound track -\n\nMusics great!\n\n- New meets old styled gameplay -\n\nI like the varied moves, big cooldown styled attacks and the way they did the Wizard and Elf. Feels like Diablo 3 gave some inspiration to this game and it's very much welcomed.\n\n- Local Multiplayer mixed with online-\n\nCan you say awesome? Because more games need more local multiplayer ESPECIALLY on the PC.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n- Progression is non existant -\n\nThe relics are neat, but im a bit disapointed with the gear. Getting more gold? Meh. It wont give me a bigger axe or make me hit any harder or put me in some shiney new armor that does something neat for me. I was hoping for deeper rpg elements.\n\n- Incredibly short -\n\nGames far too short. Can be cleared too quickly.\n\n- Dejavu with dungeon elements -\n\nPlaying through a few specific dungeons I felt they "dragon aged" it. By that I mean they copy and pasted parts of other dungeons into it.\n\n- Weak multiplayer elements -\n\nGame encourages you to take items and food from other players.\n\n- Few minor bugs -\n\nI got a crown knocked off my head and it landed on a part of the map I couldn't get at. Thanks game.\n\n- No colour palette swapping -\n\n"Red Wizard needs food badly" "Blue Warrior is about to die" - I miss the colours.. Having four warriors or four wizards would have made this better, why not? :(\n\n\n\nAll in all I'd say pass on this unless it's on a 50%+ sale. For 5-10 bucks you'll get a decent ammount of fun for a day with a couple of your friends for local multiplayer, but the lack of replay-ability, non-existant RPG elements really make this a tough one to purchase at the now asking price of CDN$ 21.99\n\n","November 9, 2014","false","3.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It feature the four heroes from the originals with the respected colors. It holds the classic arcade style hack and slash that inspired games like Diablo, with the additive of armor and relics that give the game a little bit more depth and a sense of progression. Ontop of that each character has it's own unique feel and move set, not a single character is alike in this game and it gives a very unique challenge of overcoming each stage with certain limits and abilities. It does not have many levels, but you will find that is because you build up in difficulty through them, starting in normal to unlock your first armor pieces that you will use to complete the levels in hard more, and so forth. As it is right now it has a ton of replayability and is very fun for multiplayer. There are not many levels in the base but for an asking price of 15 dollars you really get your moneys worth, and hopefully future DLC will add more levels and armor to the game.\n\nAll in all I give this version of Gauntlet a 8/10.

However, these people are idiots who don't understand that the true path to victory lies in thinking only of one's own needs, and the one class that currently embodies this most Gauntlet of all ideals is the Elf. Long range attacks with little to no effort in aiming them at food or potions the lesser classes may require, and most importantly, the broken ability to dodge roll or otherwise go faster than the slower fools and gain all of the treasure and E-sports glory for one's self.\n\nRemember, the intelligent player runs towards the elf and silently mocks whoever picks the other classes; even if the Wizard is some sort of Magika trained savant and easily input spell combos on the fly, the key is to keep the meat shields around so that you can profit from their mistake of not picking the right class.

To make things better, the game contains many upgrades in the form of relics and you can even customize your hero with new armor and weapons in the shop in the hub room.

Pretty true to the name of the series, with spammy hack-and-slash co-op fun. Food you can shoot and gold you can grab before your allies do are the highlights of the game. I'm not too sure about the "masteries" system and long grind to get more (or any) items on multiple characters, but each character is good enough at the start for someone to jump into the last levels of normal without having anything. Not sure about higher difficulties.\n\nThere are some problems though. The crown will often bounce onto various objects you can't collect it from, or straight through a wall, off the map and hang around in midair until it expires. You can spawn or get spawned into lava for immediate death. The global leaderboards barely work (played on launch day, my teammates often were not listed as part of my team for our records, or didn't show up in the score listings despite being 2nd or 3rd according to my leaderboard).  Framerate drops like crazy on many levels, even on good computers.\n\nOverall, it was a good time, especially considering the relatively low price point.","September 23, 2014","true","11.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Honestly, all the classes are a blast to play, but the wizard stands out to me as how wizards in ARPGs should be implemented in ARPG's: mental acuity combined with skill.\n\nAs mentioned above, it doesn't have that grand scale of Dark Legacy or Legends, opting for the classic dungeon crawler vibe it helped to create. The humor lightens up the atmosphere and creates a jovial atmosphere that makes multiplayer great, and with a good complement of friends, you could be looting with the best of them.\n\nSpeaking of which, the game allows you to use gold to purchase gear and loot, as opposed to items and levels in previous iterations, giving it immeasurable depth.\n\nChances are, you'll find something you'll like here, and 20 dollars is a great price for a game of this caliber.

Stop shooting the food!\n\nGauntlet comes back from the glory days of the arcade after a few moderate attempts to revive the franchise.\n\nWhat's presented to us here is an interesting take on an old-school idea:\n\nGrab your friends (Online or offline), choose between four classes, enter the arena, and slash/shoot/blow up your way to victory!\n\nJust...stop shooting the food please.\n\nGauntlet is centered around fun with your friends. From the beginning you will be facing hordes of enemies that can be dealt with better as a group than by yourself. While nowadays some may draw a comparison to Dynasty Warriors or other hack-n-slash games, the different game mechanics presented with each character help spice things up.\nLike Magicka? the wizard might be up you alley.\nLike a stick shooter? Pick the Elf\nWanna button mash your way to victory? The Warrior and Valkyrie might be the choice for you.\n\nWith reviews coming in for about 6-7 hours of completion time, Gauntlet seems to be a little on the short side of the gameplay factor. And yet, it will probably have you coming back for more, as you try different characters and relics combinations that add more variety for the game.\n\nFor its price point, it seems like a very fair deal as it's not trying to market itself as a AAA title, but more of a fun afternoon/night time fun with your friends after work.\n\nFor those who want some nostalgia with a new kick to it, or those who have never heard of Gauntlet!","September 23, 2014","true","7.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

What this game sure reminds me of is the Dark Alliance series on the PS2 and Xbox and I had a great time with those, just straight, arcade fun hack-and-slash action. I just hope that this game doesn't die quickly since it relies heavely on online co-op, if that happens then ... it'll be a thumbs down most certainly, cause when you're playing it alone, it's not that novel, it doesn't cut it in this day and age when it comes to content and you end up wanting to play something more fulfilling like Dragon Age, Path of Exile or other dungeon crawlers.","September 24, 2014","true","4.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

They're flawless.\n\n\nWarrior:\nPlays like he should, press the X X X and the Y Y Y. His B spin attack is invincible and gives you some extra range. I dislike how you have to charge his charge, but the charge jump attack is good even if it takes a bit of practice to get the range right. His heavy attack deals a LOT of damage, very useful.\n\nValkyrie:\nI like her dash attack more than warrior's bull run (although I like the warrior's bull run) her shield doesn't seem that useful since hordes are usually how you die, but she does a good job of being different than the warrior so kudos.\n\nArcher:\nEasily the most broken of the classes, his bombs, rolls, and power shots are incredible. It doesn't take long to learn how to massacre monsters with archer, but there is a bit of a skill cap so he's not entirely braindead (just monstly brain dead)\n\nWizard:\nI hope you liked magika because this guy is magika as ♥♥♥♥. Good luck using him. He's easily my favourite to play as but he is by far the hardest class to play. He has a TON of spells and they all have individual cool downs so poppin' off damage can be easy, but you're going to need to memorize all the spell inputs before you can even be mediocre at wizard.\n\n\nAll in all the game is really fun and I hope you guys check it out and enjoy it.","September 23, 2014","true","8.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You can also only carry so many of them as if they're really all that great anymore.\n\nThe level design is extremely stale and as soon as you start the game you get the notion "I'm going to see a lot of the same S***" through this game"\n\nIn conclusion when I got this game I was pumped after all the years I'd been trying to get a better computer to run it properly and in all the years I've played video games I've NEVER played a game I completely hated and felt cheated, for buying it and I've enjoyed some games people really cannot stand. If you're a fan of the older games, especially the last couple releases like "Dark Legacy" and "Legends" this is not the game for you, you will be SEVERELY disappointed. If you're a fan of the orginal you're SLIGHTLY better off, but I STILL do not recommend it, What makes games like Mortal Kombat so good is they kept what made the games great initially while adding content to the games that improved it, what makes this game bad is they tried to dumb it down all the way until it was simple like the originals, and then tried to make it more "real" which is dumb for such a game that was built for the kind of "cheesie goodness" kind of feel\n\nMy comment: Why doesn't Warner Brothers just put funding into a "Gauntlet Dark Legacy HD" that plays online and add content to that? That would have been MUCH better.","March 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The only other way to get cool items is beating the regular campaign levels on harder difficulties, but the only actually cool items require Unfair difficulty which is legitimately UNFAIR.\n\nSo what do you have left for this game? Oh the actual regular gameplay... well.  Its sort of boring, and I only go through it to complete challenges, get new ♥♥♥♥, progress in the game, etc. The replay value? None. Game mechanics are intentionally simple, which is fine, but when the challenge in this game is the stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ "setups" they have for you to die in this game (inclosed area, ridiculous spam amount of enemies, Death, etc.) and not interesting or creative ways to help challenge the player, all it does it ♥♥♥♥ me the ♥♥♥♥ off when I die and if I don't die, its so repetitive It makes me not want to play the game for longer than an hour. I can't do this game any justice, besides the different realms (set of levels, whatever its called) the variety of different scenarios is very limitied, and ♥♥♥♥ there are only 3 realms in the whole game. Yeah, this game is short as ♥♥♥♥. You think I haven't played enough hours in the game to be able to write a review? Ive sped through most of the game, like 55% in what... two hours? Again, semi-understandable given this is like a coin-op styled game, but guess what kiddoes.... ITS STILL SHORT AND REPETIVE AND OVERLY DIFFICULT DUE TO POOR GAME MECHANICS AND SETUPS. Highest graphics look like blended ♥♥♥ textures as if it was on a medium graphics setting for a normal game.\n\nReviews for this game are even dumb, im sorry but if you even watch IGN reviews in general you are apart of the 13 year old minecraft, CoD, PewDiePie fan club conformists, because IGN is completely bias and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in their reviews. The people who gave this game an accurate rating was Gamespot's Justin Clark who wrote in the FIRST SENTENCE...\n\n"In some sense, the world already has a series that carries on the Gauntlet legacy; it's called Diablo"\n\nGo buy Diablo, Go buy Torchlight, ♥♥♥♥ even get any clones of the sort because Gauntlet just feels like a cocktease Diablo, to be completely honest. Diablo 1 was released on December 31, 1996 and provides more variety than this game.\n\nYou know what this game is? 1. "omg a new Gauntlet game" hype  2. Obviously rushed production of game for release around Christmas time 3. Game feels like a demo 4. Price is way too ♥♥♥♥ing high 5. Mostly boring gameplay and ♥♥♥♥ graphics for its time 6. This isnt 1985 anymore so there's no excuse for this lack in variety\n\nThis game is a pile of garbage with "Gauntlet" slapped on the front.\n\n5/10; my head hurts from banging it ten times after trying to beat the season 1 unfair difficulty for the millioneth time (Im not even joking)\n","December 30, 2014","false","3.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

It makes exploring the game a bit fustrating.\n-Looting; When you collect gold coins u all share the gold but if someone dies that person loses there pocket change. Which would also allow someone to pick it up after u drop giving that player who picked it up more money.\n-Classes; okay...I have to be honest....being a melee class...really sucks....Because the Wizard and the archer are the only characters that can get any kills and stay alive while the melee classes could barely get any kills in. Melee classes also die alot if they dont have any space to run back and forth to the monsters...run in, hit once...run back... thats it for melees while the ranged classes will kill everything before it even touches them. another diffrence is, melees are really good at taking spawners down...so thats a plus for being a melee...right..? not really the spawned mobs will just suround u and you'll die if your not careful.\n\nHowever, i would still give it a try.

And using a keyboard - the navigation is tricky.  I still can't see how to use potions whcih would be helpful in the race from death.  Even at Easy level you can shoot food and potions.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/W1ggle/recommended/258970/","W1ggle","himynameiswill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/W1ggle/","259 products in account","First off, if you are on the fence about buying this, i beg you not to look at the forums first. Most of it is people screaming "OMG RIP OFF GIVE ME REFUND BAD GAME -1/10" Its simply not true and ill explain why in a moment.\n\nSecondly, i will say right off the bat that im not a Gauntlet veteran. I played the game at the age of 6 for a few years, totalling probably about only 10 hours at most in my life. Since i was about 9-10, i havent touched the franchise since. I bring this up because i just want to make it clear that although i do have a nostalgia for the game, seeing as it was a game i was brought up on, i was never a huge fan on the franchise as a whole like i am in series such as the Elder Scrolls. I just dont want people to look at this review and neglect everything i say because i dont have a feeling of what the classic game brought, but i also dont want people to think that im a die hard fan and will defend it no matter what.\n\n*NOTE* Im sorry if i leave false comparisons and miss out features that the original had. Its been so long since ive played it i forget what mechanics it had. Comment if i get anything wrong\n\nWith that out of the way, ill start off with saying that i think this game is a great tribute to the 80's classic. The reboot comes with updated graphics, new powers and relics, yet keeps the feel to the original within the base of the game. You continue with your four classic characters: Warrior, Valkyrie, Elf and Wizard, each wielding unique attacks and mechanics.\n\nThe one hope i had this game would have is that they would not only keep true to the original, but add onto it; constructing new methods to the way we fight and loot. And they did this superbly. One thing that i was extremley impressed with was the development they have made with the Wizard class. As stated before, i dont know how the Wizard worked past Gauntlet II, but the way combat is used in this title is Magicka esque, and i found the combat in Magicka to be incredibly satisfying.\n\nCombat on all the other characters has been enchanced too, adding several new moves for each character. The game also is no longer limited to 8 directions, which as whole makes the game feel much smoother and more enjoyable.\n\nCollecting gold, potions and keys is still within the basics of the game. Gold is now not only used for score purposes, but acts as a currency (Gold being used as a currency in a fantasy game?! Never!). You are able to purchase new apparel and relics from a store between levels. The relic system has been implemented very nicely. Now you use collected potions to to use the powers your relics give you. From a gust of wind that send your foes flying back or summoning a creature to fight alongside you, the game makes you feel like you are a true champion fighting through the tests of a dungeon.\n\nI cant comment on the multiplayer as ive only played just over an hour of the single player to see what its like, but from 2 friends of mine, theyve said theyve had no issues with it, so expect a fun, action packed quest with people around the world.\n\nTraps, unlockable doors, secrets and variations on foes are all back from the classic and they are stronger than ever\n\n\nBut with all the praise does come negatives, and i couldnt write a review without explaining them.\n\nA major issue that people have had with the game comes technically, and it is all linked with your method of playing the game. Many people on the forums have shown disappointment in the lack of both controller support and key rebindings. I have found messages from the game's devs stating that they will fix this asap, but at launch in 2014, you shouldnt expect a game to lack a rebinding feature.\n\nUntil this gets fixed, fixes have sprouted up for the controller support side. Currently, it seems that only Xbox controllers are properly supported, but many have resorted to programs such as XPadder to get their pads to work.\n\nEven though there is a fix, games shouldnt be being released with lack of basic features.\n\nAnother thing that i found not to my liking is the skill shot aiming system for a few characters' skills, Valkerie's Y move expecially. You notice it in the tutorial when using a controller, and you just dont seem to have as much precision as you should. Its the same problem for some of the wizards skills also.\n\nThe final gripe i have with the game is the way it handles  boss-like enemy, Death. In the previous games, Death was this powerful creature that could inflict immese amounts of damage and also held a high HP count. This take of Death i found to be more than anything, annoying. Some stages are Death stages, as in Death is present throughout the whole level. You may just think that im just bad at the game and cant kill him, but his attributes have no changed. He is now invinsible and his attacks are instant death. No special attack or relic can save you from him, you are left with just running. And this forces you to rush through levels at an absurd pace. I want challenge, but i dont think this is what i wanted. With challenge i wanted collosal hordes of enemies swarming me, not a big floating ghost shuffeling me along the level.\n\nAs a whole, this game is fantastic. I want to try and compare this game to Diablo; a dungeon crawler with lots of enemies and tons of death. But without the in depth character inventory and skill trees, it kinda misses out on being like that. It instead is an action adventure hack n slash. And boy does it perfect it.","September 23, 2014","true","9.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

As for loot, there are cosmetic options that you can earn in the game with gold purchases, and relics that you can purchases and upgrade for limited use during the levels. The four classes are quite distinct and I've found a few good combos for 2-player co-op.

It's a quite short, which is dissapointing, but its very replayable and there are many difficulties. I wish it was more arcade like - and that people could jump in whenever so you dont need to go to the lobby all the time to try to get more people as its most fun with a group of 4. It's a little unbalanced it feels, the warrior feels much weaker than everyone else and no one likes to pick him but they will likely patch to balance the characters a bit more (everyone wants the elf).","September 25, 2014","true","17.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Really brings back the old school arcade action hack n slash fun.\n\nPros:\n- Up to 4 players at once\n- Smooth, fast paced combat\n- Replayability via harder difficulty modes\n- 4 very different classes\n- Fun graphics. Easy to look at and enjoy\n- Great music\n- No crashes (yet)\n- Only $20.\n- Works amazing well with a controller\n\nCons:\n- Limited replayability based on actual content. This game needs a map maker, or endless levels.\n- 4 very different classes that are very poorly balanced with each other. Some are clearly more OP than others, which means the "competitive" aspect results in the same classes coming out on top 99% of the time for the end of level bonus.\n- Hackers (hopefully they can fix this soon. At the very least, ban them and remove them from the global scoreboard.)\n- Buggy class abilities cause inconsistancy and unreliability when you need them to work as they are intended.\n- Obviously designed with paid DLC in mind to keep the game more replayable. (the ending credits even hint at it).\n- Works pretty badly with keyboard and mouse. Awkward and limiting.\n\nOver all, despite the cons, the game is very fun. A great game to jump in for a short to mid duration action spree with your friends. If this had been at the arcade, I would have easily spent 20 bucks in quarters just trying to beat it. So yeah, its worth the buy.","September 27, 2014","true","6.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
