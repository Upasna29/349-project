"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuorez/recommended/280520/","gsuorez","Grayson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gsuorez/","291 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nMain differences between Crea and similar titles:\n1) The art style is more indie, adventure game and less retro, super nintendo (personally, I like Crea's better, but it's a matter of taste)\n2) Breaking blocks takes FOREVER. Much grindier than any similar game. Remember the earliest Starbound releases and how long it took to take down a tree at the beginning? Slower.\n3) Combat is very slow and shallow. You stand still and attack, they stand still and attack, and you win because you have more hp. You mostly use ranged weapons because melee range is tiny.\n4) Inventory space is frustratingly small, and you will spend even more time than usual sorting chests, because even the largest chest isn't enough to hold your most basic resources.\n5) Block placing is excellent, in Crea. It snaps to a visible, well-defined grid. Building in this game is Minecraft-clear, and good.\n6) There are some control anomalies that are probably just a matter of early access: no drag & drop, crouch doesn't exist, you use one tool to break everything except furniture which has its own special skill. Oh, and there's a weird, camera dead-zone in the middle of the screen. So you need to constantly re-adjust your mouse location if you're trying to, say, dig tunnels and go mining. No idea why the camera doesn't simply stay centred on the player.\n\n7) The biggest difference? The research mechanic. Once you find a material, you must take it to a research station. You must then put the item on the table, select one of five item categories, then research the material. This consumes the material as you research, and unlocks a piece of the crafting recipes for items in that item category using that resource, up to the level you are currently able to research at. This means that you need to sit and research the same resource over and over, in different categories and at different research levels, before you can craft items that require that resource. This mechanic is straight-up frustrating and the biggest down-side to Crea.\n\nNeed some chests (and yes: you need buttloads of them)? It's not that you didn't have the wood and vines. It's not that you didn't research the wood and vines. It's that you didn't research both materials in the right sub-category at a high enough research level. Oh and the recipes in your crafting book? Until you do research the correct material at the correct level in the correct sub-category, you have no way of knowing which of your dozens of materials you need to perform further research on.\n\nConclusion:\nI'd recommend playing one of the other of these sort of games, and coming back to this one in the future.\n\nMost of the down-sides (slow break speed, wonky block placing, control hiccups) appear to be a simple matter of early-access balance/control issues that we can count on getting resolved. But the research mechanic tacks a layer of grind-without-reward onto gameplay that simply isn't fun, at all. Combat is also incredibly shallow. Monsters are slow and so are you. Don't expect to be jumping, dashing, ducking around and trying to figure out what swing-speed/arch best fits your situation. You stand there and hit it, and it stands there and hits you. One of you dies and if it's you, you lose nothing and respawn a couple screens over at the nearest waypoint you were using.","August 3, 2014","false","3.6"," 248 of 299 people (83%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","83","248","299","5","17"

The dev has stated that the game started with the idea of "A easy to mod Terraria clone." But it changed. In it's current form, just about all it shares with Terraria is it's aesthetic, and that it's a 2d sandbox. Crea, first and foremost, has dramatically different combat. The combat in crea is very dynamic, a lot of dodging and blocking, and with a lot of skills for you to use. There are even combos, and there are several different paths you could go in terms of combat.\n\nNext is the crafting. Crea takes a new approach to crafting compared to other sandboxes, in that you discover he recipes by researching the pieces of the items themselves. The end result of this is that finding a new recipe is more like a scavenger hunt than anything else, as you look for the piece that completes your recipe.\n\nNext is exploration. Exploring in Crea is something that it often feels like there is a good reason to do, in fact, it almost always feels as such. While it doesn't feel like exploration is the core of the game (as, indeed, it isn't), exploration is rewarded, and required. The materials you need are not centered in a small place, they're all over the world, and should you decided to spend most of your time underground, the tunnels always feel more like you're spelunking, than anything else.\n\nThe last big piece is modding. This game has possibly the best mod support I've ever seen, so in the future, there will likely be a wide range of different ways you can play the game, all through modding.\n\nSo through all of these things, it's really a very different experience than Terraria. While it's not quite TF2 vs COD, it's close in how they're dramatically different, though of the same genre.\n\nNow lastly, it is worth pointing something out. This is early access, there are bugs, there are character wipes, and if you don't want those, wait until the game comes out. However, the primary developer of this game is one of the most active in the community from all developers I've seen. Someone makes a suggestion, he might have it implemented within a day. Someone asks a question, there will usually be a quick answer from him. What this ends up meaning is that the people in early access have a very big impact on the game. When something is implemented which no one likes, the developer changes or reverts it, and listens to the community for suggestions on replacements. What this all ends up meaning is, if you want a stable game wait until it's released. If you want to have an impact on the game, and don't mind dealing with non-game breaking bugs, then get this, it's an excellent game.\n\nOne last thing, when looking at the reviews, look at the date, the developer holds the policy that, while in early access, the game should be different enough every two or three months to warrant another playthrough. And almost always the older reviews which had problems with the game have had the problems fixed.\n\nAnyway, long story short, I'd recommend this game.","July 26, 2015","true","179.2"," 234 of 284 people (82%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","82","234","284","12","9"

The only differences are that you craft NPCs and in order to learn new recipes you need to find a material and then research on it.  You can craft from chests, which is really nice.\n\nBy far the biggest downside is the bugs right now.  They simply make the game no fun because you're constantly losing items that you crafted, losing characters, having skills get bugged etc.  Give it 6 months or so for them to fix all the bugs and then it'll be worth it.","February 1, 2015","false","6.0"," 277 of 359 people (77%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","77","277","359","22","13"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FranNyan/recommended/280520/","FranNyan","frannyan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FranNyan/","243 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCrea is a sandbox exploration and building game, much like Minecraft and Terraria. Unlike Minecraft, it's 2d and doesn't suffer from 3d camera troubles, and unlike Terraria, it's multiplatform, so it can be played Linux native.  It also adds RPG elements so you can level up, focus on your skill sets and chose between various different armor and weapon types depending on your play style.\n\nWeapon classes: Each weapon class has it's own upgrade tree that branches off towards the top into a variety of top tier weapons\n- Sword/melee: Your normal hack and slash.\n- Pike/melee: Stabbing from a slight distance\n- Wand/magic:  Sling spells without using MP\n- Bow / Range:  Plink away out of range.\n\nIn addition, there's magic, which can be used alongside your weapon which comes in both offensive (fireballs and the like) and defensive (healing, shielding, etc)\n\nArmour types have a similar branching tree that the weapon classes do.  There's basic armor, then it branches off to give the choice of 3 top level armors.\n\nWeapons, armor and mining tools can all have bonuses, something that you can put your skill points into improving. Like in an RPG, not all items are the same, which means you can almost always make better equipment as you continue to level. This gives a nice feeling of progression to the game.\n\nLike Terraria, there is a boss battle that changes up the world a little.  However, this is mostly an upgrade without the race against the clock aspect battling the Wall of Flesh gave.  A new ore is peppered through the world, and a new category of drops is added to the mobs, allowing for higher level equipment.\n\nThe monsters in the game scale to your level, rather than being procedural. A low level character will always encounter lower level monsters and vice versa no matter where in the world they happen to be.\n\nAs a benefit to exploring, Crea has a built in fast travel/teleport system. Way crystals can be set as spawn points and as long as you carry a shard with you, you can always teleport back home.  Way crystals are in random locations across the world and under the surface, making it much easier to get back to digging through the cave system.\n\nCrea is also very easily moddable.  Items can be created, the game files tinkered with, near anything you want can be done.  The official forum has a section for people to swap mods and get advice on how to make their own. Even with almost no programing knowledge, it's pretty easy to look at the source files and fiddle with things until you get the result you want.\n\nCrea is still in beta, but it's a very active beta with a very active dev and decently active community that's pretty good at pinning down the bugs and coming up with possible workarounds until the official patch comes out.  Most bug fixes are pretty swift it arriving, especially when they're big ones.  It's very playable as is. Multiplayer is still a bit wonky as of this review, but it was recently given a complete overhaul and I assume will be fixed up as the dev has a very good track record in that respect.\n\n\nOverall, a very enjoyable addition to the genre and very worth getting.","May 30, 2014","true","160.3"," 171 of 213 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","171","213","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shoezor/recommended/280520/","Shoezor","Will Smith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shoezor/","169 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI don't write a lot of reviews, or a lot of anything, so bear with me.\n\nCrea is a very fun game. Combat, mining, building, and crafting in a 2D world. It's similar to Terraria, which is what interested me, but far far from a clone. It's early access, so expect bugs. Luckily, the developer is very active on the forums. He is very helpful, and I've personally watched him solve three or four bugs on his twitch stream. I believe he spends hours every day with his stream up, and anyone can come in and inform him of difficulties they're having. I also think he has promised to release updates every week, however some weekly updates might only be bug fixes.\n\nIn Crea, your character gains xp on each monster kill and levels up. Each level up gives 2 stat points, and you can spend them on health, stamina, attack, defense, intelligence (matk), mind (mdef), agility (ranged), and luck. I would say the coolest thing about Crea is the talent system. You have a talent tree for Arms (swords, axes, and bows), Syle (magic), Gathering (mining), Crafting, and Exploring (double jump, lockpick, inventory boost, and other noncombat boosts).\n\nCombat is, like I said, similar to Terraria. At least the controls are. Left click to pew, but with each click of an attack or use of a skill, your character's stamina will drain. If you allow your stamina to reach zero, your movement speed is reduced and you cannot act until it reachs about half. So always stop attacking before you reach zero.\n\nCurrently there are swords, spears, bows, and wands. Each weapon style has a standard left-click attack, and then each weapon has the possibility of dropping with an element (earth, wind, water, fire), as well weapons can have secondary attributes (piercing bow, lifesteal sword, damage buff on kill axe, ricochet bullets, etc.).\n\nTwo very important commands would be the ability to block and dodge. Dodge causes your character to roll forward or backward with invincibility frames. Blocking reduces the damage you take from an attack. Combat also has skills, unlike Terraria. Active skills such as fireball, shield stun, triple shot, protect, raise (multiplayer), heal, etc. Passive skills include stat increases, weapon power increases, shield power increases, move while charging, move while blocking, etc. Passives are boring, but useful.\n\nMining is mining. Grab pick, mine ore, build better pick, mine better ore, etc. It works. Currently I've discovered the ore progression bronze, iron, silver, and gold. Not sure what's after gold, or how many ores come after gold. I've heard people mention Corium, which I believe may be the endgame ore. I'll skip over the building aspect, since it's never interested in me.\n\nCrafting is fairly simple as well, at least the act of crafting is. You just open the window, click a recipe you've unlocked, and clicked craft. Where Crea sets itself apart from others is the act of unlocking recipes, which is very in-depth, but also pretty annoying at times. Recipes have a crafting level I believe, but you can't see what level they are. Whether or not you gain crafting experience is dependant on the level of item your crafting.\n\nYou have to research recipes using base materials. So if there was an iron pick, and it required wood and an iron bar, you'd need wood and an iron bar. You would also need to be a high enough crafting level to unlock crafting iron picks. Then you'd approach the research table, and it would say that you can currently research iron bars and you can research wood. You research with the wood, it tells you you've learned part of the iron pick recipe. You research with iron bar, it tells you you've learned the entire recipe for iron pick. Then you can craft the iron pick.\n\nIf you have half of a recipe unlocked, you can view it in the research table and you'll see a dark shadow of the other items required. You might recognize them. If you don't feel like hunting down or finding out what else is required, then you can spend Scraps to finish the recipe without researching. This will unlock the recipe. Scraps are obtained when you research normally.\n\nAnother awesome aspect is the dungeon system. You can sometimes find portals to dungeons in the world, and sometimes they spawn when you break a monster spawner. Another method is to unlock the Dungeoneer NPC, and paying him in currency and stone to send you into a dungeon. You can pick and choose the dungeon difficulty, size, and modifiers, or click the random button. Dungeons are awesome for finding loot you haven't unlocked and for grinding experience.\n\nGripes:\nI can't seem to unlock the next tier of wands, and I don't know if it's because I don't have the materials or because I don't have a high enough crafting level. I can craft better swords, bows, and axes than I can wands, and I'm playing a mage build character. Without crafting levels displayed on the crafting window, I don't know what items to even craft to level up my crafting.\n\nMagic, melee, and range do not seem to be very balanced. I haven't managed to use melee successfully at all. Magic is decent, but pales in comparison to similarly leveled range (range is 3-4 times more powerful, for sure). However range requires the crafting of arrows, and I have a hard time crafting enough to keep up with my dungeoneering (as far as I know, feathers only drop from birds one at a time, and I don't see them very often). Stamina drains very very fast, but you get used to it. It's a real bother when fighting the plants that multiply if you don't break the eggs in time.\n\nSilver seems to be more rare than gold, as I have found way more gold than silver on two different characters in two different worlds. Five ore per bar is not a big deal with bronze and iron, but at the silver and gold levels it feels like way too much. Character leveling (not talent) feels a bit too slow.\n\nAll in all, I would definitely recommend this game. It's not very expensive, and it's definitely very fun. I will be putting way more hours into Crea.","December 18, 2015","true","33.0"," 69 of 76 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","69","76","2","0"

It's got a kink or two for me but most of that is based on personal taste.\n\nLeaves are money/10\n\nLong version:\n\nCrea satisfies a lot of itches I have about games. It has an EXP system that actually means something first of all, so all that "self defense" actually gets you something.... which is better self-defense outside of gear. More than that though, there's more to it than just combat.\n\nSpend a lot of time gathering? You get gathering XP, which can level up gathering talents; make your tools better, get a chance of getting multiple resources, it's all quite satisfying. Spend your days crafting? Get better at that, make better things with bigger stat bonuses. Which brings me to the stat system, another rpg element that I've missed in similar games. It's pretty standard as far as rpg-stats go, having your bread and butter physical-and-magical versions of attack and defense. You can bump up your health and stamina(used to attack or cast) as well, or your luck, but I haven't felt that the game railroads you into building up one stat or another.\n\nThe combat is split nicely between melee and magic, both of which have some ranged and melee options. Some players go mixed, others dedicate to magic or melee only; like many other things it's up to the player.\n\nThe building reminds me of Terraria, but with more furniture. Nightstand/10, would craft again.\n\nThe crafting is... interesting, as it's mixed with a research system where you need to essentially figure out what you'd need to make something. It consumes the material items or "scraps" that are produced during research, and you can't craft a given item until you've researched all it's components. It makes crafting things a bit more satisfying, though it can be tedious if you don't know what the next item is based on the siloette or where to get it.\n\nThe NPC system is based on putting outfits on figures. This brings the figure to life as that NPC, which can be "collected" as the outfit to then move base. Personally it kinda freaks me out that my base is full of wooden figures walking around, pretending to be human like I don't notice they're ♥♥♥♥ing made of wood, but that's just me.\n\nMy only two problems with the game are perhaps personal, but they may or may not resonate with you. One, for the longest time the game would randomly lag and be borderline unplayable. That seems to have fixed itself, so I may have missed an update where this was addressed. Secondly, it has Minecraft syndrome.\n\nI don't mean it's trying to be Minecraft. I mean there's no real direction at first and it's left to the player to figure things out. It's not spectacularly complex, certainly not to the point you can't figure it out, but I've found myself feeling a bit lost at points. The best thing I can tell you is to set small goals for yourself; you can do a lot in Crea, and having a plan helps. Build a house, shank a slime, dig a tunnel, cast some spells, get your ♥♥♥♥ pushed in by a Harvester, you do you.","February 23","true","29.0"," 60 of 66 people (91%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","91","60","66","8","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/superficiallight/recommended/280520/","superficiallight","Nova","http://steamcommunity.com/id/superficiallight/","176 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nHaving played multiple games of this specific genre on Steam, I can definitely say that Crea offers the most enjoyable and creative experience of them (Terraria, Starbound, Edge of Space). To fully enjoy this game, however, you must like the genre first ("sandbox"), and you will need to adjust your habits from similar games.\n---\nTerraria started (well, maybe not just Terraria, but Terraria was among the first) the craze of (2D) sandbox games, but the game cannot be truly called an Action RPG as well. Game progress, including all the equipment and weapons you get, is defined solely through crafting and picking up items. Even health is determined mostly by finding Life Crystals. Weapons themselves become the measurement of progress, too. (That is to say, you probably won't be using a Minishark in hard mode, but the Megashark is conveniently there.)\n\nIn Crea, your progress and effort also define growth of your character in the form of skill points (experience). For every action that you take that is either appropriate or hard for your level, you gain experience. In fact, Crea becomes more of an RPG, because each character can level skills to their benefit. Even special skills become bound to your character, that were otherwise items in Terraria, e.g. Hermes Boots. I suppose I didn't realize how limited Terraria's design was until I saw (before I discovered Crea) how little space I have for everything. On a similar point, using equipment is straightforward; unlike the three aforementioned games, you can put those on your character's equipment screen and use the appropriate skill. For example, you can change your harvesting tool (which can harvest like an axe or pickaxe by the way) and not need to change your hotkeys.\n---\nIn Crea, not many enemies exist, but each is uniquely designed. Specifically, each enemy attacks in a different way, may be influenced by the time of day in some way, and exists in different biomes (with some possible overlap). Generally, you cannot just rush into enemies and make it out alive; by comparison, Crea is much harder than Terraria but more reasonable than Starbound (looking at you, tier 10 planets) and Edge of Space (when I played it; apologies if I'm wrong now). You need to carefully attack enemies, because running out of SP (energy meter) may possibly result in your death. Many of these enemies also have alternate attacks that are deadly. I'm glad that the game is challenging but not "cheap" either. Without spoiling the content, I can confirm that the bosses are also very specially designed. The game is unfortunately vague sometimes, so you may not have the right idea about accessing a boss.\n---\nMany of the gameplay issues I encountered awhile ago have been fixed. These weren't necessarily game-crashing glitches but more or less how you play the game. Thankfully, researching materials has become easier since you can use a fairly common item called Scraps instead of the item itself. Other things were changed, too, but the thing I'm most grateful of this game is that it's being very actively maintained and updated, considering the size and resources of the developing team. I don't want to stress the developers, but they've really made the game enjoyable as each update passes.\n---\nIn other thoughts, Crea has a very distinct yet nicely done art style. It doesn't look quite as "pretty" as Starbound's, but it's much nicer, especially considering the detail and relative sizes of objects. For example, several crafting stations (like the Ingot Mold) are tiny, but they are very nicely drawn and detailed too. For that, I consider the sprite work excellent. Additionally, the color palette is nice on the eyes and yet distinct - I can spot ore that is different, for example, so that's a plus.\n---\nWith that said, I fully recommend the game.","November 29, 2014","true","87.2"," 124 of 168 people (74%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","74","124","168","9","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/happillamas/recommended/280520/","happillamas","Flaffee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/happillamas/","21 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nTo be clear, I never really review games, but due to the low amount of reviews for this game in particular, I figured it would help to write one myself. Furthermore, I'll try to be as clear as I can concerning what I've experienced in this game in the short amount of time I've played it. I'm not going to do a pros and cons, so the review might be a little long. I'd rather discuss what the game offers and leave it at that. If you don't want to read a long ♥♥♥ review, skip this one entirely.\nLastly, one thing to note, keep in mind that this game is in Early Access. This means there are some bugs, but none of them are gamebreaking from what I've experienced. For example, I entered a dungeon and was suddenly unable to grapple and another time could not jump to the left or right, only up and down. This was fixed by restarting the game.\n\nOverall Appeal:\nI think a lot of people will get into this game because of its similarities to other titles, such as Terraria and Starbound. I personally have played only a little of Terraria and quite a bit of Starbound. To put it simply, the things this game does have in common with those is that it's your typical sandbox: you can build, craft, and fight things, all on your own accord. In the meantime, Crea offers a little more variety than I experienced in the other two, with its skill and crafting system, which seem to have more thought put into them, as well as more freedom. I'll cover this later, but in any case, I believe that this is a worthy alternative to the other titles. I had a lot of fun playing and enjoyed all aspects of the game equally, some more so than I did in Starbound/Terraria. The look of this game, including its UI, might not appeal to everyone, but I liked it a lot.\n\nSkill System:\nThe skill system is one of the big major upsides to this game, imo. This allows more character based progression, putting aside what armor and weapon you have equipped, and allows more of a rewarding experience. Differentiating from the titles mentioned previously, this game allows you to obtain experience and TP. TP is then used to level up skills and obtain new ones, similarly to an RPG.  It includes categories for Arms, Style, Gathering, Crafting, and Exploration. I'll explain each below:\nArms includes weapon skills, focused more on melee attacks, weapon proficiency, shields, and archery.\nStyle is for those of us who like to use magic, including spells, wand proficiency, and the potency of your damaging spells as well as your heals.\nGathering is pretty self-explanatory. It includes skills that make your tools more effective by increasing the power, pick-up range, as well as how many blocks you can dig up/gather at once with a tool.\nCrafting is also pretty self-explanatory (except maybe not really). I'll cover how the crafting system works in its own section.\nExploration includes skills such as ledge grabbing, double jumping, lockpicking, and sprinting. It also allows you to level up stats such as your Stamina and Luck.\nCrafting System:\nThe crafting system is different from both Terraria and Starbound, in that you need to gather materials and research them to discover recipes. This means, for example, you pick up a material, use your Research Table to research it, and discover a new recipe. Under Recipes, you will see the recipe, as well as outlines of the other materials needed. If you can tell what they are, great. You go get them, research them, and learn the recipe. If you don't, then it's a matter of finding them as you progress through the game and discovering the recipe via researching those materials. As well as this, every time you research, you gain scraps, which can be used to skip finding the undiscovered materials of a recipe and discovering it ahead of time. They can also be used to avoid spending your materials researching.\nFurthermore, there's also a Chaos system I haven't really explored yet. I might update the review when I understand it more, but from what I gather it allows you to use skills (obtained via the Crafting category) to increase the quality of items you make via a separate crafting process that is optional when making items. I'm guessing that this is mostly used when making Armor/Weapons in order to apply stats or status effects. Again, I'm not sure, but it's worth mentioning in order to emphasize how intricate this system is in particular.\n\nGathering System:\nI only want to cover this because I've seen a handful reviews saying that gathering/digging is too slow. I don't know if these people just didn't get far enough in the game to figure out the skill system, or if they're saying it's too slow no matter (which is kind of pushing it). I want to clarify that gathering is slow in the beginning, but as you obtain new tools and gain TP in Gathering, then use it to level skills that increase the power/reach of your tools, it gets much faster. No problem here unless you're just too impatient to level it up.\n\nOne thing to note before buying:\nI got this game for myself and my boyfriend, who doesn't have that great of a computer (to be honest). Neither of us experienced any lag, issues getting the game running, or setting up multiplayer in the beginning. However, as time went on, the game became unplayably laggy for him. We believe this is due to the large amount of processes this game runs in the background for its UI, called "Coherent UI host". I'm not sure if this is a bug or if it's supposed to do this, but by the time it was running 10 or so of these processes, he could not move or use any skills.\nI, on the other hand, had no issue playing for long periods of time and have yet to encounter anything other than the occasional stutter when the game autosaves. In other words, if you have a potato for a computer, it might be a little risky to get this game right at this point in time. I say this because the devs said they would update this game early June, which might fix it. Have to keep in mind the game is still in Early Access, so this doesn't affect my opinion of the game overall and I still had fun playing.","May 26","true","18.8"," 20 of 20 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","20","20","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/recommended/280520/","drpixel","DrPixel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drpixel/","3729 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nCrea is another entry in the recently extremely popular 2D Sandbox genre. However, Crea is unique in that it acknowledges the roots of all this popularity, Terraria, and tries to build off of that with unique new mechanics while still trying to retain that core gameplay that we all know and love (or don't; it's all up to personal preference of course).\n\nFor those who may not be familiar with the genre, Crea plays like most other 2D Sandbox RPG sort of games. You walk around a randomly-generated landscape, clicking on blocks to collect them, killing enemies along the way. As you gather more varied and rare materials, you are able to craft various items, including weapons, armor, furniture, tools, and a few other miscellaneous items. To be able to learn how to craft most of the items however, utilizing the research system is necessary. To research more advanced crafting recipes, you need to use a small quantity of each material you find to discover what uses you can make of them. This system was pretty neat in my opinion and I would love to see it become a staple of the genre.\n\nThere are essentially three different ways of dealing with enemies in Crea: melee weaponry, ranged weaponry, and magic. Personally, I love using magic to sit back and pick off enemies from a distance, There isn't a large selection of magic or weapons, but there's still an adequate variety of them to dispose of any monsters in your path. There are also "Divine" spells that help to assist you with positive buffs or give some well-needed healing in dire situations.\n\nFrom a glance, Crea seems to be actually almost a direct rip-off of Terraria, just with a somewhat different art style. This isn't really true though, as Crea includes some great new additions to the typical 2D Sandbox game formula. To start with, Crea includes the usual gear-based progression system of acquiring new, more powerful weapons, tools, and armor as you acquire better, more valuable materials. Something possibly unique to Crea is its "talent system", where as you engage in combat, use spells, craft items, or research recipes you gain "TP", which can be used to boost each of the previously mentioned areas a bit. The more that you mine for example, the more TP you are able to gain to potentially make mining just a tad quicker. One thing that did bug me a bit when I had first started was that mining seemed to take quite some time, but after I crafted a snazzy new pickaxe and upgraded my mining talents things went much smoother.\n\nOne very unique aspect of Crea is the "conflict" system in place. If you don't actively slay monsters, they will continue to grow in strength and numbers throughout the world. This was very noticeable when I had played, as I immediately went on multiple mining expeditions early on and never really fought monsters above the ground until I had the gear that I wanted. When I finally had crafted all the gear that I wanted to take on (supposedly) anything in my path, I discovered that when I came back to the surface new "Paragon" enemies that were larger and more deadly than the previous enemies had appeared and were proceeding to kick my ♥♥♥♥. Monster spawners had also appeared quite rapidly throughout my world, and these were generating more and more monsters to add to my growing problem. This system is quite cool in my opinion, as it creates a unique conflict for the player personally- do you sit safely in comfort and idly gather more materials, or do you engage the problem at hand before it becomes harder and harder for you to safely stroll out in the world? In addition, monsters actively level up as you do, so there's never really an overly easy battle in Crea. Bosses are also in the game I've heard, though I have not encountered any in my time playing so far.\n\nA fast-travel system is additionally in place in Crea. As you explore your randomly-generated world, you are able to find Way Crystals that allow you to travel immediately to another crystal in the world that you've already found. These Way Crystals can also be found underground, which is convenient if you're able to find one while mining deep below the surface and want to quickly travel between your home and your mining area.\n\nTwo features of Crea that I didn't delve very much into are multiplayer, which is supposedly new and thus has some early issues, and the extensive modding support the game includes. I did join one multiplayer server I had found from someone who left their IP address on the forums, and it was a bit of fun, but the multiplayer system did seem to be in its early stages for sure and there was a few small problems. The game currently is still in Early Access of course, so there's plenty of time for it to be cleaned up a bit more. I would like to see player names not just in the chat, but also above the players or maybe if you hover your mouse over them, and perhaps a basic server browser for those of us who may not have friends who also own the game or want to go hunting for public server IP addresses. Concerning the modding support in place, I honestly haven't delved into it much so far, but glancing at the forums on the developer's site, they seem to be very active in assisting any players wishing to create mods for Crea, and the system in place seems to be fairly easy to make mods to do nearly anything in the game. So far, no major mods seem to be out yet, but as the game is still fairly new hopefully fairly interesting mods are released.\n\nThe sound design of Crea doesn't seem to be a major focus, so there's not much to say about it. The sound effects are basic, but they work. While not overly prevalent, the music featured in Crea is alright. I would prefer to be listening to more active tunes, but the current set of peaceful, calming music is still pleasant to listen to.\n\nGraphically, Crea features pixel sprites very akin to that of Terraria or Starbound, but with a slightly more fantasy theme. Two things in particular stand out, to me at least: the designs of the monsters and the backgrounds when above the surface. The monsters all have a fairly unique look to them- to the degree that it's difficult to relate most of them to something we're familiar with. Sure, there's some scorpions, sheep (called "speep" in the game), and birds, but also some very unusual bird-like creatures, rodents, sinister slimes, and even odder things deep beneath the surface. Most of the monsters seem to fit in perfectly with the fantasy theme of the game, and it helps to increase immersion for sure. Now, while not overly incredible, the backgrounds as you move from biome to biome above the surface are pretty to look at, and help to differentiate different biomes as they gradually change to a new background as you move from left to right or vice versa.\n\nWhile others may argue which is the best of the 2D sandbox genre, it's important to note that most of the games are still in-development and can't be fairly judged. Crea is likely one of the youngest games in the genre, and so it's difficult to fairly assess it in its current state. As it is, I really did enjoy my time with Crea. I was able to build a small home after a few hours of mining. I had fun with defeating monsters of varying strengths and sizes, and exploring the vast world I was in. I don't think that I've even begun to dig deep into the amount of content Crea has to offer, and thus I'm not if I can safely say how much I might potentially enjoy it.\n\nThe game is also still in Early Access as I write this, so the amount of content and features that are in the game currently can only increase as time goes on. The developers are extremely active, and seem to have a great knack for talking with the community very often and answering any questions people may have on the forums. This is a game with a lot of heart and soul put into it, and so it appears that any issues the game might have will quickly be ironed out.\n\nI give Crea a 8.5/10 in its current state.\n","June 7, 2014","true","8.6"," 40 of 55 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","40","55","2","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anil235/recommended/280520/","Anil235","Anil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anil235/","27 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAfter 20 hours of gameplay in 3 days, it's well past time for me to give some feedback. Please note that this may contain spoilers for newer players.\n\nCombat:\nThe combat system is intricate and diverse. You can go from being a magic-wielding battlemage to a deadly archer to a brutal melee character, with no long-term effects if alternating between different playstyles. You have a lot of unique skills that can be used to kill enemies, defend yourself, or heal yourself. There are 4 different weapons; bows, swords, spears, and magic.\n\nBows are the most powerful of the 4 in terms of damage. The ammo is fairly simple to get assuming the player isn't using the bow for every minor encounter.\n\nPros:\nEasy-to-get ammo\nHigh damage output\n\nCons:\nOccasionally on shooting, the trajectory is a good bit off of what one would expect. You can more easily see what I am describing when shooting down at enemies.\n\nSwords are the next weapon and the better of the two melees. They are dangerous to use in comparison to other weapon types.\n\nPros:\nInfinite usage\n\nCons:\nLimited to ground or low-flying enemies\nDangerous to use, even with melee armor\n\nMagic is the third strongest of the 4 in my opinion. It is diverse in terms of skills, simple in terms of weapon types.\n\nPros:\nRanged attacks\nUtility and damage skills\n\nCons:\nWands have short ranged attacks that make them difficult to use\nLow damage output\n\nSpears are the final weapon. They are not very good at all.\n\nPros:\n\nCons:\nHard to use; aiming at enemies that are in you is practically impossible.\n\n\nThe combat weapons are interesting as there are a lot of them to use. Swords will limit players' abilities to button mash as there is a better way to swing that involves timing and precision rather than button-mashing. The stamina limitation is understandable but a little bit unnecessary for attacks, in my opinion. The magic wands and skills drain stamina rather than mana or something else of the sort, which makes little sense. Although this avoids confusion, it isn't very realistic.\n\nCrafting:\n\nThe crafting system is clever and fun. Crea has modifiers just like Terraria, however these modifiers are applied to weapons via a system called Chaos crafting. After playing a short minigame, the end quality that you score is then used to determine the quality of the modifier you receive. The system is interesting and better than Terraria's reforging system as it doesn't involve mass amounts of currency and the end quality of an item can be controlled through skill progression.\n\nIn addition to Chaos crafting, the other notable mechanic of crafting is research. Researching a recipe is necessary in order to craft it, and the researching is done by consuming crafting ingredients. The system only allows you to research items that for sure are used in something, and as far as my experiences go the consumption of an item guarantees you are on step closer to the end of a recipe. This system is a great way to create progression and it is a clever one overall.\n\nBosses:\n\nThe bosses in Crea aren't the best in my honest opinion. Although they are unique, the actual implementation is lacking.\n\nSano:\n\nSano is the first boss you will fight, generally speaking. The fight involves you to bring down the shield around her by using her own attack on her, and then you attack her like crazy during the 10 seconds before she resummons her shield. The fight is fun and challenging. The part about her that I don't like is that there isn't a clear goal to go to after defeating her.\n\nDormian:\n\nDormian is the second boss in the game. Dormian is the opposite of Sano in that the goals after the boss fight are clear but the actual boss fight is poor. The reason I say this is because the boss fight comes down to attacking the right clone of him to bring his health down. The actual attacks he uses are balanced and fun, however figuring out how to attack him is very complicated. After already defeating him, I still don't completely understand the logic behind which is attackable and which isn't. It came down to a game of attacking random ones so that when they all shifted again one of the ones I attacked would lower the health of the others.\n\nMiscellaneous:\n\n-Numerous bugs are in the game, however numerous bugs are being fixes every single day by the developer.\n-Performance issues that include massive drops in FPS that happen periodically. Performance was greatly increased over Weekly Update #23, however.\n-A longer tutorial that detailed parts of the game beyond Chaos crafting (remnas, for example) would be much appreciated by newer players. This is especially important due to the lack of an up-to-date wiki.\n-The developer, Jasson is very active and friendly. Numerous bugs are fixed each day and the developer is very helpful on the forums. It is great for the future of the game to have such a developer working on it and helping its community.","January 12","true","27.6"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","3"

I honestly like both. Terraria especially was one of those watershed games for me that got me really excited for something different than I had played before. Somewhere along the way, Terraria stopped development. Later, Terraria began development again, but the original team was different. Because of this, my personal opinion is that Terraria is missing that certain something that makes me both want to keep playing, and to play again. My personal opinion is that Terraria just never reached it's full potential (yet).\n\nSo why am I talking about Terraria in a Crea review? Ultimately, we tend to compare things as human beings. Terraria is the single most likelt comparison when looking at Crea. So the foundation of my opinion is partially based on what I didn't like about Terraria, wheras listing the good things about Terraria is less germaine to a Crea review.\n\nLet's make some of the obvious comparisons between Crea and Terraria; both are side scrolling 2D sandbox action/adventure games. Immediately you notice that both require chopping down trees and killing slimes for a primary ingredient needed to make torches. So very quickly it's impossible not to notice near identical design choices. Beyond some of these simple things though, we start to divert from the earlier same-genre games and Crea makes it's own niche.\n\nThe glaring differences of Crea are still under development and that's an important thing to know at this point. Things like crafting research, which is required to progress and craft, actually may change to a smaller or larger degree; that is the nature of in development software. Moving forward, it's still important to realize the design goals that differ in this game.\n\nI mentioned research that is required for progression and to craft. It's not my purpose to expose the full mechanics in this review. I also feel it's part of the enjoyment of this game to experience these things for yourself. Suffice to say that the research system puts the player on a path that makes progression inherent in the game, regardless of your play style.\n\nTo compare and contrast with Terraria, for the most part the player would only need make or find certain crafting tools, such as a forge, in order to unlock all recipes of a certain type. The crafting and, indeed, the exploration of Terraria comes down to mindless time sink, especially the first time through. In Crea, the system is more robust. It can feel grindy, but the game is actually slowed down. Nice tools like teleportation (which I'll not spoil by explaining) are therefore not overpowered as they provide the nice time saving boost they should be instead of just speeding up and already fast crafting progression like in Terraria.\n\nI hate to gloss over very important features like the RPG style level up systems, but again I don't want to spoil the discovery a new game brings. Just know that your character levels up from a traditional XP system from defeating creatures and other hostile entities. In addition, there is a "talent" system where you gain separate talent points and corresponding levels for each of several categories, including arms (melee and ranged weaponry), syle (magic), gathering (mining, forestry, other gathering), crafting (both crafting and research) and exploring. All activities earn TP (talent points) that can be spent to buy active and passive abilities. Again, I don't want to spoil too much so I don't want to give much info out here. Just know that some things like how well your mining tool works is partially tied to your experience using such tools as gained through gathering talent points. So it's not just a matter of getting a better pick. A better pick helps, but your character improves through experience as well, which makes the game more enjoyable for me as I progress regardless of whether I've stumbled on enough of a certain resource yet or not. Also, mining some of that dirt and stone actually pays off as you occasionaly earn some TP for it!\n\nCrafting on it's surface is very generic to the genre. However, there is a still-in-development system called "Chaos Crafting" which is really a sort of boosting mini-game. It is off-putting to some folks. It is not required to craft. You merely have the option to invest more time and some special resources to try to improve your crafted items. I have only dabbled with this system and I don't quite get it, but I look forward to using it in the future to make better items as I progress. Again, this is another example of game mechanics that slow the game down a little bit, add some challenge, depth, replayability, discovery and... fun!\n\nSpeaking of fun, ultimately we play our games for the fun we have. If you play Terraria and liked it, you'll probably like Crea. If you felt Terraria was just not what you wanted, and you want a more RPG style game that has a little more organized progression, you'll likely prefer Crea. If you want to zoom to the end of the game in Terraria and despise climbing the progression ladder, best to stick to Terraria. If you're just not sure. then it comes down to the cost.\n\nJust to touch on the cost, I always felt Terraria was too cheap to not buy. I agree that EA games that are "too expensive" are not something I generally interested in. That's all a discussion for another place. But, Crea's price at this point is certainly open to criticism. For what it's worth, I don't think the dev's are really pushing their product, I really think their actions so far have proven they really just wanted some dedicated people willing to buy in that will help development. With the features available so far and the development pace, I'm personally very happy to buy at the current $15 US price.","August 12, 2015","true","11.5"," 66 of 105 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","66","105","5","13"

The game has a lot of potential, and in a market that has spawned a lot of Terraria style of games, Crea manages to have its own unique style and feel that helps it stand apart from the crowd. Early game progress is slow, and the learning curve is a little steeper than something like Starbound, but once you've managed to get nice gear and delve deep into the underworld you feel as though you've accomplished something.\n\nOne big selling point of Crea for me, that lead me to back the project on Kickstarter in the first place, was the concept of developing from the ground up for complete mod support. The code is all exposed so the community will be able to help shape the game long after the initial release.While Crea has run into some development issues in the past, Jasson and Kelley have been active in the community and open and forthright during the entire process.\n\nIf you're a fan of Terraria and felt that Starbound didn't quite scratch that itch Crea might have what you're looking for. I've been playing the game on the DRM free version, so my Steam time played is deceptive. I've probably put over a hundred hours into various characters across the different builds of Crea since I started playing several months ago, and imagine I will find myself playing quite a bit more once the multiplayer functionality is a bit more stable. Multiplayer is where games of this nature, in my experience, really shine.","June 3, 2014","true","96.7"," 26 of 38 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","26","38","0","0"

I liked Minecraft a lot, too. I love open world games that are full of exploration, lots of things to do, and lots of loot to drown yourself in. 2d side scrolling games like this tend to be called Metroidvania games.\n\nI first got Crea many months ago and it was rough, unpolished and hard to play. I waited. MANY updates have come out since then so I decided to give it another try a few weeks ago. I am glad I did.\n\nCrea has an in-depth crafting system that actually takes a bit of thought to figure out. You don't just have materials, you have crafting methods. They call it Chaos Crafting. There's a variety of crafting techniques to apply while you are crafting something. It's up to you to find a combination that works well. If you do, you can get some amazing results.\n\nThe enemies in Crea are likewise as well thought out. You can't just run up and whack and enemies like you do to Terraria's slimes. Enemies in this game have different attacks, but they all have certain patterns that you can figure out.\n\nWhat the game needs most is variety in what the player experiences. Once you craft that next tier of armor and weapons you're off to do more of the same, just in a higher level area, battling the same monsters who are simply higher level. The game does have biomes, but as of this review, they're only surface biomes that don't mean a whole lot at the moment.\n\nHowever, the game is solid enough and enjoyable enough that the $15 price tag is well worth it at this point. Combat is a blast in this game. Since development is still very much underway who knows what we might see for the biomes or maybe even new, different underground zones.\n\nCrea has a ways to go before it could be a contender for king of Metroidvania Mountain.

However, this game does have some things setting it apart. The main difference is the RPG elements attached to it, where you can basically level up everything and even acquire new skills. Yet while the game has some neat features going for it, it also does some things wrong. And it is for that reason I can't recommend this game for everybody, so read on and/or watch my video to find out if this game is for you.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/Q2jJOsvPrVg\n\nFor those who want the basical summary, here's a concise pros and cons list of my thoughts.\n\n+The RPG elements of leveling your skills to make you fight, mine, and even craft better is very nice. You're not even limited on what path to take, so you can take every bonus you want for melee, ranged, magic, or building. It doesn't matter.\n+The sandbox world keeps you wondering what is out there and encourages you to explore. There is even plenty of caverns that lead into the depths of the world, so you don't have to mine everything over and over again.\n+By far the best feature I've seen from this game is the ability to use materials in nearby chests when you're crafting. No more sorting or looking through chests to find that one monster drop you picked up long ago. The game automatically senses you have it, and you just hit the craft button.\n+There's only one tool you have to upgrade that chops down trees and mines. You're not forced to choose between axes, pickaxes, or hammers.\n\n-The mining in this game is an absolute chore. It takes forever to mine out a path through the earth or ores, even after upgrading your tool a few times. It just drags the game out needlessly. The fact that it's only one block at a time and you have to set your mouse directly on it to mine doesn't make it any better either.\n-In order to craft things, you have to first research all the parts in order to make it. I actually liked this at first, but then my opinion changed after the first hour since the researching costs you the material, so you have to keep farming the same thing over and over again. Throw in the fact that you have to keep tossing away the same item multiple times for different recipes, and you're just gonna find yourself in an awkward place like I did where I was on the verge of making progression, but I either lacked a material to make the item, or I lacked a material to research so I could make the item. Combine it with the above negative and the fact you don't know what the item may be, and you got yourself in an annoying situation.\n-The monster spawn rate in this game varies way to much. Often times I never get a single baddie for ages, even when I'm mining deep down. This is terrible because you need a drop from a certain mob to make torches, but when you can't find it and run out of torches, you're forced to go all the way to the surface again and farm a monster that is sometimes a pain to find. But then there are times where my screen starts getting swarmed, and not with the mobs I wanted.\n-Some of the abilities are really underwhelming. I wanted to be a mage and maxed my fireball spell. Now while it did do more damage, the spell was just rubbish. It has cooldown of a few seconds that makes it really awkward to use. The animation finished in the blink of an eye, but for some reason, your dude can only stare at his enemy and let himself get wailed upon. Combine it with the paltry damage it does and the mana bar that limits its use, and spells become really worthless. Heck, the ice and fire spells both function the same to but only have a different sprite firing out. And when I found out my crappy copper dagger did more damage then my maxed spell, I just gave up on being a caster.\n-Because of the above, this game has a terribly slow pace. After 4 hours of playing this, I feel like I barely got anywhere, and it's not a good feeling.\n\nSo yeah, you may be wondering why I recommended this game after the big negatives I listed. Well, it's because I still enjoyed myself somewhat. I wanted to explore more and find out what skills I would get and what the world had to offer. That's the mark of a promising sandbox game.\n\nBut to be perfectly clear, I believe you can only enjoy this game if you liked a really slow, relaxed experience. If you want something more exciting, then I strongly suggest you go to terraria or starbound. But just keep in mind that this is early access, so maybe the devs will change the pace, or maybe they won't. So if you're still on the fence, it may be best to wait until this gets released. This has the potential to be up there with the big hitters, so I hope to see it go places.","May 31, 2014","true","4.8"," 29 of 44 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","29","44","0","6"

The RPG/Explorer is a sucker thing for me. I love how the crafting elements is so immersive, you must research in-game to figure out how to craft new things. The combat system has multiple spells and it's own specific point system. (I.E Style has Style points and Craft has its own Craft points.)\n\nThis may be odd, but I'm sensing a backstory on the whole world of Crea. For example, why is it when I hover my mouse across certain things, various letters are scattered, seemingly like they're missing? Who is Renma? Why is a feather a sign of forgiveness?\n\nThere are 2 modes in this game, Build and Combat. You must press R to switch in between which is a bit annoying, but with time you'll get used to it. Also, the graphics are absolutely beautiful for a pixel game.\n\nNow, there are some bad things in the game. For example, the beginning enemies can be WAYYYY too diffucult if you're difficulty is set to normal. Most of the Ink-slime thingies are level 7 straight off the bat, while you're stuck at level 1.\n\nOther than a couple few annoyances (rarely happen), it's a well polished game.\n\nAlso, kudos to the developer for being so helpful and responsive. I read about a guy who watched his stream, and the Developer was taking reports for bugs live on stream! I love it when developers feel like they're actually there, unlike most developers. *cough Chucklefish *cough*\n\nAnother thing I'd absolutely LOVE is more in-depth on the story. How was the world of Crea created? Most of the ingrediants in the game have some lore attached to it. (I.E The Renma core or whatever it's called) Little notes scattered across the terrain or in caves would be absolutely amazing to have since it intrigues the player to discover and explore more.\n\nTL;DR\nWant an upgraded version of Terraria? Want a developer that actually gives a ♥♥♥♥? Want a (somewhat) intruguing lore and backstory? Want a level-up system that actually matters? Want a combat system that lets you fight however YOU want to fight? Want a beautiful game?\n\nThen go for this. Prepare to be a little annoyed though at some bugs (I.E Character not showing on create screen), but it's in Early Access so it's alright.\n","March 18","true","1.3"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

I like this game more than terraria but havent played it as much due to it being early access and all. The heavier focus on the RPG system is what attracts me alot more. There are tons of ways to build your character with the TP (basically skill points) you get, the magi system has been taken down a notch, though I guess it was kind of complicated before. But like I said. You can be a mage, you can be an archer, you can be a fighter, you can be a tank wizard, you can completely avoid combat by just running fast and jumping high. I havent played very much this patch and I dont know if you can still do it, but I used to just stack defense and use the fire aura spell and things would kill themselves on me.\n\nThe gear crafting is pretty interesting though I'm still not 100% sure how to get the best outcome of it. You an apply different skills when you make an item to give it better stats, but you can use them in different orders for different possible outcomes. There are a good amount of effects you can get on your items such as just raw stats, bonus damage/defence and things like life steal. I hope this gets added onto for things like effect procs such as "x% chance to cause an ice explosion that slows enemies" or "this shield has a x% chance to block 100% of incoming damage" ect.\n\nThe combat felt kind of stale when I first started playing, but you can get better combos by investing skill points in certain weapons and what not, you can block which applies your shields defense somehow or another, not 100% sure how it works. You can dodge roll behind things when they try to hit you. But you have to moderate your stamina the whole time or you'll become exhausted and not be able to do much other than walk slowly and jump until your stamina refills. It's honestly a pretty good feeling system. Early game it might feel annoying if you get in a big fight but when you get some more stamina it's not so punishing to just go ham on things.\n\nOne thing in particular that I really like is that there are portals that spawn that take you to instances like dungeons or just a big area with lots of enemies and sometimes spawners to kill. I havent run into a dungeon yet, that was just recently added but you get some pretty nifty rewards for doing so if I remember correctly. If not just the rare drops that enemy spawners drop.\n\nAnyways, the devs update this game alot, I miss the old complicated as heck magic system with tons of different spells, but the new one is still fine and dandy, there are lots of new skills added to other trees such as combat, crafting and exploring. Building is pretty good so far though it's not what I really look forward to doing in these games, exploring is pretty solid, enemies are diverse, there are bosses (which are just bigger badder versions of smaller things) that will randomly spawn and likely wreck you. I think it's very worth buying or adding to your wishlist and keeping an eye on. I straight up love this game and cant wait for it to hit full release.","October 8, 2015","true","9.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","2"

It goes without saying that the game features mining, crafting, and building systems that are found in similar games, but there's much more to Crea that makes it stand out.\n\nFirst, there's research. Instead of being able to craft items as soon as you have the materials, in Crea you need to do research first. This is a really cool mechanic, because it gives the sense of having your player tech up. It also gives the player an urge to explore the world and see what it has to offer, instead of telling the player that they need x, y, and z material right off the bat, and turning exploration basically into a grocery list.\n\nThe monsters in this game are also really cool. They are all unique and adorable. Also, there are no zombies, which is always a positive in my book.\n\nThe teleportation system system is awesome as well. There are way points throughout the world, called "Way Crystals," which allow for a fast travel sort of system. This is nice, because it allows you to jump to specific points throughout the world while being able to go back to your base to empty out your inventory from time to time.\n\nIf you decide you like Crea, but want something more out it, I should point out that Crea is built from the ground up to make modding as easy as possible. You can add anything you want to in this game, so I guess if you really want zombies, there could be a mod that lets you put them in.\n\nThe community behind Crea is really awesome, too. The forums[siegegames.com] are full of people giving feedback on the game and providing support to new players as well. The devs are also active on the forum, and will add features to the game based on community discussion.\n\nAll in all, I think that Crea is definitely a game worthy of your attention, especially if you like games like Terraria. Even if Early Access is something that makes you uncomfortable, I would recommend that you keep your eye on Crea. It has amazing potential, and I think it would be a shame if you passed it up now and never came back to look again later.","June 3, 2014","true","35.1"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

I do generally like 2D adventure/sandbox games, but that is definitely not the only reason I like this game. It is already pretty unique and I believe it will only become better. To all of you saying, " Oh, it's just another Terraria rip-off," I say please be quiet! (Trying to be polite :) ) Starbound started off as "another Terraria" but became so much its own game! I believe Crea will, too! Crea is great fun even when it is in a pretty early stage. I do think things can be refined a bit. The things are: a bit more in-depth tutorial because things can get confusing, slightly faster progression and leveling up, and less creature spawners and a creatures spawning more naturally. There are also plenty of good things: unique art style (pixelly yet detailed), unique creatures and world, and a decent pace, especially for those beginning the game, maybe not for ones more into it.

I dug a little further and found a community guide on steam that helped me learn the basics. Now changed to a positive review because this game actually deserves it.\n\nIf you're willing to be a bit patient for the first hour while you learn some controls, this is great fun and highly recommended.","April 28, 2015","true","2.7"," 36 of 67 people (54%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","54","36","67","3","4"

Although it's still in early access (and therefore pretty glitchy/laggy) it's still an overall great game.

I'm not sure friends of mine would appreciate it's slower tone, but I, for one, love games like these. It does manage to set itself aside from Terraria, Minecraft, Starbound, and Edge of Space---but does so in a way I'm not sure how to put into words quite yet. I love it's focus on RPG style leveling of skills, and how the more you use them, the faster they level, and the more skill points you have to pour into that tree. It's a neat concept in a sandbox game. I think what I love about Crea above all, is the simplicity. It's very easy to unwind in. It's very easy to grasp. I've played related games and the tutorials are just throwing UI after UI at you. As of this review, there's only maybe---4 or 5 main tabs you'll be using besides your hotbar. It's not that complexity baffles me---if done right, it can be wonderful, but in a very specific line of previous games, it becomes a chore and overwhelming. In Crea, things are displayed in a very easy-going manner, at a great pace. The game is what you make it! If you want to sit down, have a little drink and something to eat, and manage things in your house before exploring the deep undergrounds---then go for it! Crea isn't for everyone, but if you want to have a simple and fun time building and exploring, then it may just be for you! I'm glad I picked it up. I hope to follow the devs as they unleash each new update.

Very similar to Terraria, I would say Crea is most like Terraria as far as a successor, at least so far. Where Starbound is more about exploration, Crea is more about sticking to the core and adding more mechanics. It has rpg like progression where you gain skill points by using that specific skill line. For instance, if you shoot something with an arrow your physical attack tree will gain experience. The same goes for crafting, buff/healing, sorcery and gathering. When they level up each skill line you gain access to new, more powerful skills.\n\nIt has a big emphasis on researching materials in the world in order to unlock new recipes. You will need to keep exploring deeper and further to progress to higher tier items. The world is very similar to terraria where you can find chests and all kinds of loot in various places. It has a crystal system in the game as a fast travel device. So once you find the crystals you are able to travel between them for a small price. They are located above and below ground. There is also an advanced research system in place that requires finding recipes from monsters.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing. Crea has the look and feel of the game down as well. The soundtrack is put together so well, it is very relaxing and perfect for the game style. Very reminiscent to EVE Online's awesome ambient soundtrack. Hopefully they will make it even longer before release. The UI is very slick and easy to use although for the amount of spells/item combinations it does need a little tweaking in my opinion. Having ten hotkeys and then each having a right/left click bind has been done over and over and I would really like to see a new and efficient action bar/UI implemented in this genre. Or at least a big improvement.\n\nAt this point in development the most you can do is craft the highest ier items and face one boss. I pretty much got as far as that which was 20 hours of gameplay. I enjoyed it thuroughly and am eager to see what they will be bringing to the game by release. Seeing that the game is early on in develoment still and in early access I would give it an 8.5/10. It will have to do a lot of work to maintain or beat that by release though. The game is also highly modable but I haven't checked anything like that out yet.\n\nThings I would really like to see before release.\nThe world needs to be filled with different dungeons/exploration triggers and bosses/special monsters. Content basically and it's early access so I'm sure this is in the works. With these 2d sandbox games the funnest part is the mystery of what you could find.\n\nI like the skill progression system. But, as of right now the whole thing is kind of pointless because there are no decisions to make. You unlock the next 3 skills and then to level them up until you hit the next skill unlock level. The skills themselves need a lot of polishing as well and they need to, look cooler.\n\nThe UI needs something to make it more efficient or intuitive. Is it ok now? Sure, but it doesn't improve on the genre's adopted UI or do anything new.\n","July 14, 2014","true","33.4"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","2"

Well your right it does. You know the famous quote "Don't judge a book by it's cover"? Look at the game Delver for instance. If you were playing Delver a few years back it was 8-bit, minimalistic. It was a simple game, back then I don't think it was really worth what they were asking for. But now, wow does it look different now! It completely changed. And now comes with Texture pack support so you can change it around even more. That's what you have to think about with early access games, you never know what could change or when! Just because graphically the game looks similar to Terraria does not make it a "clone" or "rip-off", the 2D-pixel side scrollers have been around far longer than Terraria.\n\nGameplay wise Crea feels great. There isn't much in the game when it comes to building blocks or materials, but to me that is a plus. I sometimes feel overwhelmed in Terraria or Starbound with all the blocks I could use to build with. It can get stressful, and I don't want to get stressed over a game; I don't think anyone does. Now keeping in mind this is Early Access, so there is much more to come.\n\nNow another thing you are probably wondering about is the "easily moddable" line that is mentioned. Now folks, you can't just hop into a program and make your own mod within minutes, you still need a basic understanding of what to do and it still takes some time. But Crea encouraged me to learn the basics and I've already made a few mods myself. That fact the Crea has official mod support right out of the gate is amazing! Unlike some other games *cough* Minecraft *cough*.\n\nTL;DR: This game is astounding, the fantasy-style worlds with the RPG-style character progression fit together perfectly. I'd play this over Terraria any day of the week.\n\nYes this game is Early Access, it has bugs and it isn't finished, that may turn some people away. But it's really great to follow the development of a game and help shape it to where it should go. If your afraid of the developers leaving the game, don't worry. They have built from the ground up an amazing game for over 3 years. If they haven't left yet they are not going anywhere.\n\n5/5","May 29, 2014","true","4.2"," 12 of 21 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","12","21","0","0"

Crea focuses more on the traditional sense in it being an RPG.

So if you want to spend an entire day just mining and leveling up that gathering skill, you sure can.\n\nCrea's crafting system  also has yet another divergance from it's Starbound and Terraria siblings, in that you actively need to use resources and materials for research. Simply having some stone and wood doesn't mean you can make an axe. You have to use the Research Table, and actually figure out how. Consuming the materials in the process however.\n\nThe game might start off slow, but once you get into the swing of things is extremely fun.

However it's not just another clone, it has similarity but has its own unique way of playing. So you start of with basic tools and weapons, typical stuff you'd find in these sorts of games. However, You have and attack and build/gather mode which you can swap in between. It takes some time to get used to that, tho is a really nice feature when you get down to it. You have a hotbar for both combat and build, so you don't have to have a gather tool or block in your combat mode bar. You can also have 2 hotbars for each mode, so you can have a different set of weapons and skills. That being said, you gain experience for each thing you do, like killing mobs gives you combat exp, crafting gives crafting exp etc. Once you gain enough exp you get talent points which are used for various things like new combats skills, or skills to help you mine faster etc. There is fair amount of skill, so I won't list them off. As you progress you character gains stats, standard rpg mechanics. You can add points for more health, stamina, strength etc.\n\nThe combat, is well not the greatest but not bad either. You swing in a upward motion which is kinda odd, other then that its fine. You also get magic, which uses your stamina bar. I haven't done very much magic but it seems really cool. Combat could use a bit of work, tho. The sound effects for it are kinda lacking, however they are planning to add more in later.\n\nNow on to the crafting, pretty standard stuff here gather materials and build. However, you'll need to research items in order to build new ones. Some thing require, one item to research other take more as you discover items. Once you research and item you can craft it. When crafting you can also add modifiers to it, not sure how it all works yet as the tutorial doesn't really help much. There is much more to do, and much more I haven't discovered yet.\n\nFinal thoughts, Its a pretty good game if you are into like Terraria and such games. However it does have a few bugs, and bad frame rate at times. Those are likely to improve as patches come out. The game releases soon so you can either buy it now or wait.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nPros: Replay value, since you can build your characters differently\nConstantly Updated\nLots of content\nSkill progression, gives the game more of sense of accomplishment\nMultiplayer\n\nCons: Combat is ok\nMissing textures sometimes\nBad frame rate drops\nSome bugs\nCrafting and researching needs to be explained better\nLack of sound effects, which they are going to add","June 5","true","10.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Honestly if there's something you don't like about the game, just post it on their forums and one of the devs (in my experience) almost always reads it or replies back with some information or further questions.

I'm excited to see what mods people create, and maybe even for contributing one myself.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are good, and I sort of like the slightly different control mechanic. I find some others in the genre a little clunky and didn't have that experience with Crea.\n\nSo, while it's good, I had to mod some things for it to be playable for me. The rate of collection from the beginning is slow, which is fine, but I also have a day job and wasn't enjoying the grind -- this is a pretty simple thing to fix, and there's a mod tutorial that will give you enough information to modify the tool you're using to make it faster (the tutorial is for windows, and I'm on a mac). If it seems like I'm complaining, I'm not, because I had the power to change it to my liking, which is really the idea. Though, it might be nice to have this be a world setup configuration for those that don't want to jump into modding?\n\nI appreciate the concept behind the research, and think it's a good idea. I would appreciate seeing a research tree, or at least some indication of progression though. I have researched all the materials I've found (there's an indication bar for each material, and it seems like when it's full/yellow you've researched it as much as is possible), but I don't really know if there's more materials or anything, which makes it sort of feel like more of a hinderance than an advancement. I really can't say if I have researched all of the craftables or not -- is there more? Not sure what my feedback is about making that feel more explorative and less restrictive though.\n\nThat's pretty much it for my feedback. It's a fun play, and it feels pretty wide open for cool mods -- if you know python, get in there and start CREAting.","June 15, 2014","true","7.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I recently just started playing again as of two days ago, reason being I've been busy most of the time, With little time left to seriosly play this game. What I am really a fan of is Crea's combat system. You can actually use your shield to block and you can somewhat dodge things, it's not just  *click* *click* *skill* and there is a lot of different ways to mix up the combat to have a continuiously fun time.\n\nWhat I mostly spend my time in Crea doing is Exploring, and crafting. Even with 300 hours on the game I can definitely say There's a lot I really haven't done, due to the fact I've been just exploring the world. There's so much to see and discover. Exploring is fun, yes, and it's not completely useless. you actually do NEED to explore, you won't be able to find your materials all in one place. You have to go far and wide to find the things you need.\n\nWith crafting there's a ton of things to do with this. Before, (which I thought was more fun) You had to actually go around and kill stuff, and use the items you find to put towards a crafting recipe in order to find out how to make the item. So you'd need to find the materials one by one until you finally get the right combination. That's also something I've had fun doing. Now, it's a bit more easier and i'm not complaining, it gives me time to do more in Crea.\n\nLastly, the modding is something I have great hopes in. There are already some creations on the workshop, but I would like to see a lot more.  This is the game where I definitely want to try to sink my feet into with modding the game. I also would like to see a lot more people play this game, but that's going to come sooner or later. With Crea, there's really an exciting future in store for all of us fans.

This game adds an RPG and a research dynamic that are a lot of fun, and helps with the feeling of progression. The varioius spells in the game add more unique ways of killing enemies as well. I am not really into the "base building" and I just buid the essentials(no decorations), so I cannot comment a lot on that aspect of the game, but I have no complaints about it either.\n\nIf I did have any compliants about this game they would be:\n1. The spells do not have very much information, so it is hard to tell how much stronger the next level is. It may be based on level, but that would be useful information as well. Also, they only go up to level 5, which is easy to get to.\n2. I feel the underground is very dark, even with a lot of torches, so sometimes it is hard to see.\n3. It would be nice to be able to tell what items you could make from materials, by clicking on them in the "materials" list.

Within mere minutes, it is possible to create additional in game items from weapons to furniture.\nVisually pleasing however the scaling of the screen resolution can be an issue.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoodleofDanger/recommended/280520/","NoodleofDanger","Spacey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NoodleofDanger/","100 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n>> Please bear in mind that this game is still in early development stages at the time of this review <<\n\nI was immediately sold when I read that this game would incorporate an actual leveling system. Terraria and Starbound (while they are great games) focus heavily on what gear you have, which never really left the impression of progress when I played. I'm a huge fan of the crafting and survival genres, which I believed could only be improved upon by tossing in a few "RPG elements," as I've seen it described a fair amount of times. While I thought the price was a bit steep for something so early in development ($15 at the time), I was assured it was worth the price, so here we are.\n\n-FIRST IMPRESSIONS-\n\nUpon starting the game, I was pleased with the art style. Lightly stylized with appealing colors. Not overdone, not underdone. There are almost no graphical options, but that can be forgiven since the game is graphically simplistic. The music is nice if somewhat repetitive at times, though I presume more tracks will be added as the game is being developed. Audio settings are also sufficient for all that is utilized. All keys are almost - if not completely - rebindable, so you can adjust to your liking. The atmosphere is whimsical, straying from the retro style of Terraria and epic style of Starbound. Character customization is available, which I think is absolutely necessary in a non-linear RPG game, though I would like to see more customization options in the future. The game is looking promising up to now, so let's see how it actually plays.\n\n-CRAFTING-\n\nWHAT. THE. ♥♥♥♥. Am I doing? Ok, while it's the norm for these games to drop you in and let you figure out the moving parts, I was hoping for at least a small tutorial. ESPECIALLY when the game's research-and-craft mechanic is much different from others in the genre. The tutorial provided in the game is almost insultingly simple and doesn't talk about the stuff that you wouldn't already know, and the official Wiki is still too young to provide any truly valuable information. That being said, the crafting mechanic wasn't too difficult to figure out and is actually pretty cool. You collect different materials and research what they can be used to make, which also levels up your crafting talent. However, crafting is not paced very well; I've researched everything needed for high-level weapons and armor but am still missing parts for low-level ones. This is after having exploring the surface completely and hours of spelunking. It's a unique concept and is well-implemented for the most part, but improvements can definitely be made as far as pacing is concerned.\n\n-COMBAT-\n\n*Disclaimer: "Combat" in this context refers to the use of weapons, not including magic*\n\nTo be completely honest, I've spent very little time with combat since I primarily use magic. The little I have done has been pretty good. You don't start off too weak or too strong, but just weak enough to push you to upgrade as soon as possible. It doesn't bring anything new to the table, nor does it falter very much.\n\n-MAGIC-\n\nI rarely use magic in games, but Crea's magic system doesn't want to make me rip my eyes out, so congrats to the developers! But seriously, it's very cut-and-dry. It's divided into two sections: Arcane Magic (Offensive) and Divine Magic (Defensive). You learn several different spells that have different elemental characteristics that are more/less powerful depending on the enemy. Healing is fairly weak in the beginning, but you'll thank yourself to level it up as you progress. The support buffs offered by Divine Magic are reasonable and mostly forgiving on your SP usage. My gripes with magic would be the lack of overall variety. There is enough variety to get by, but after I got everything, I felt as though there could have been a bit more. Additionally, the power ceiling for Arcane Magic leaves a lot to be desired; after leveling a few of my spells completely, I was hoping for more destructive power than was offered. That could just be personal preference, but I think a fully-improved spell should be gratifyingly destructive.\n\nOh, and... At this point in development, there is only one boss. And if you think you're ready for it... You're not. I certainly hope they don't intend to keep this as the first boss, because DAMN... It's creative, but DAMN. Just... DAMN. Kiiiinda difficult.\n\n-EXPLORATION-\n\nI was honestly surprised with Crea's spelunking. Caves are structured differently than in Terraria and Starbound, and it brings a fresh sense of discovery as you're digging through. I am eager to see what will become of this aspect of the game as development continues and more ores and structures are added. However, there isn't much to be found on the surface. It may have been just in my experience, but I encountered nothing of interest after walking the entire globe. There are very few biomes and they don't arrive with a unique atmosphere to each one. I don't hold this too much against the devs since the game is still in early stages of development, but if exploration is expected to stand anywhere near Starbound's, this is a huge area of improvement. Oh, and I almost forgot... This is perhaps Crea's most welcome entry into the 2D crafting-survival genre beside the leveling system: WAYPOINTS. As you're exploring, you'll frequently find these God-sent crystals which allow you to warp between all of the previous crystals you have found. And it's about damn time! Seriously though. It's a pretty awesome feature, especially when you're spelunking and don't want to try to find your way back to the surface (Logging out and back in doesn't return you to the spawn point, which I also approve of strongly). Sure, Terraria had the mirror that did the same, but that ♥♥♥♥ warped me back home when I didn't want to one too many times for me to consider it a valuable feature. Seriously, ♥♥♥♥ that mirror. CREA WINS THE WAYPOINT BATTLE, YAY!\n\nOverall, I would say that this a worthy contribution to the 2D crafting and survival genre. It's to be expected that improvements will need to be made, most young games end up here. That being said, I am still having a lot of fun with the game and have encountered very few bugs. So, with the assumption that the developers are hard at work to knock out the kinks, I do recommend this game.

Crea is very much like Starbound; crafting items and weapons/armor and battling baddies. Some major differences from Starbound is that you level up when you earn enough XP, and each weapon/tool that is used will grant you the XP tied to a particular category. Kind of like a crafting survival RPG. You're always full--hunger is exempt here.\n\nThe graphics aren't anything special, but if you enjoyed playing SB's pixel graphics you'll likely approach Crea in a positive way. I've experienced some lag while playing, and this is for single-player. It's very minor, fortunately. The soundtrack's pretty soothing until it abruptly ends for an odd reason; I still find SB's unbeatable, though.\n\nBusy with Starbound so why did I buy Crea? It's indie developed and Python was used to make it--I've been learning Python since last year on my spare time, and I want to be able to see the code and learn from it.

The game feels a lot more relaxed than others of the genre, but that's also it's worst point. I know this is Early Access and alot is going to change, but in it's current state it's just kind of...barren. Within the time I played I have yet to build anything simply because there is no point, there is no threat. You can dig underground where monsters don't spawn and you're safe, why waste material on something that isn't needed?\n\nNow for for the best bit of the game, it is just so easy to get into. Unlike Terraria (which is just too clustered with content) and Edge of Space (which is a fairly complex game) it has a decent amount of content which isn't a massive overload. The best thing is, I think it will stay that way. I believe there will be (alot) more content in the final release, but not over done due to the fact it plans on using Steam Workshop. I love the idea of openly being invited to change and adapt the game to suit my needs with either community content or self made content. Why go all out adding alot of optional things that is just going to make it cluttered, right?\n\nCombat is a nice change too. You can assign items, weapons and spells to the hotbar, and then assign each one to either LMB or RMB. For example I use my trusty sword (LMB) and a good ol' fireball (RMB) which is assigned to hotbar box 1, where as I could assign a pickaxe and torches to 2 and so on. This mean alot less pesky fiddling with inventory or scrolling hotbar constantly. Spells are also one of the best bits of combat, i'm not much for a mage character but feel myself wanting to use my spells more than anything else. The problem with combat at this stage is that enemies level up with you. It's a good idea, but because everything is as strong as you, you don't feel any threat of dying or wanting to stay away from certain enemies. It's just a case of "well I can kill most of these easy". I'd like the enemies to be a preset level, so different biomes have a higher/lower threat than others. The same with underground exploring, enemies should spawn more frequently the further down you go.\n\nFinally the leveling system. I have found no fault in this so far. There are 5 categroies; Combat (Melee and Ranged combat), Gathering (as you'd think, picking up harvested blocks and items), Crafting (crafting items), Magic (using damage based spells) and Restoration (not sure that's the right name, but basically spells like healing). You don't get general experience and choose where to put in skills point, for each thing you do (kill an enemy with a sword and craft a new helmet) you get TP in that set category. This is great, why would you learn more about crafting if you killed something? I like the way it's done, I kill and I get TP in combat, I pick up some logs and I get TP in gathering. You don't need to level up to put points in a skill either (though certain skills are unlocked at higher levels), for example I can learn a new spell for 1000 TP in the magic category. This doesn't stunt level progression either, it's about amount of TP gained in total rather than how much you already have.\n\nAll in all a good game, I can't wait for the finished product. I think it'll be the one of the best in the genre ( though Terraria is hard to beat)\n\nA solid 8/10","August 26, 2014","true","2.6"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Ok, no problem.  Rebooted PC....and ...my character's been rolled back to level 3.  And this isn't due to 'not saving' - I had saved and reloaded the game to do a different world maybe only 30 minutes or so before this crash ...yet somehow, my character data lost 6 hours worth. My actual world and 'stuff' was intact, but really don't fancy another 6 hours of grinding to get back to where I was skillwise, so I'll not be playing this anymore until the data can be sorted out.  Otherwise a great game with lots of promise - would have just liked a warning about 'your character will randomly disappear or get rolled back' - whilst I understand its early access and this may eventually happen, having it happen mid-play-session is a non-starter.","January 22, 2015","false","18.7"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","2"

Updates are frequent and content grows every month or so.  There is a LOT to do and it really feels like the devs have fleshed out not only parts of the game which make it a very enjoyable entry in it's genre, but one that is a unique presence that I believe is going highly underrated.  Their community involvement is concise and appropriate, they have clear goals and seem to be extremely well organized.  The game is superb, a lot of fun to play even at its infancy considering you can play for hours upon hours without encountering bugs that turn you off.  Overall, like my previous review said, buy it now, your library will thank you.\n\nEdit 10/5/2015\n\nProgress has been great, and as I recently said in the forums:\n\nThis game is worth it solely on the premise that the developer has handled early access marvelously and is on top of the game 100%.

Crea is really based on building your own player in an RPG-type fashion, leveling up skills, y'know. Sandbox-wise, on the other hand, isn't as diverse as such.\nAUDIO: Soundtrack is a bit weird, not really my style. It's got that trance-y feel, but there's always the sound options.\nMULTIPLAYER: Not that great. Still has a IP, port, password-type interface. Kinda like the Blockheads if you've ever played that.\nWORLD DESIGN: Average. Not great, not bad. Expect something like the early release of Minecraft.\nBUGS: Yeah, early access. You know what that means; if you buy this, you'll get them. And it does come with this game; there are instances in which cursors will suddenly freeze, graphics will glitch, interactions are somewhat impossible, but just wait a while and it'll be fixed. Hopefully.\nOVERALL: A great game in the making, which will, hopefully, stray away from the likes of Starbound, Minecraft, Terraria etc. and become it's own type of sandbox-rpg.

Though, Crea differentiates itself from the usual 2D voxel games with its rewarding talents system. Yes, you've got the usual mine-craft-fight mechanic, but now you've also got skills to manage that improves your game. It's a bit like Skyrim's where you accumulate points (TP) in certain talent areas based on what you do, then spend those points on perks. It's interesting and rewarding since certain perks actually change up the gameplay a bit (like being able to ledge grab, or being able to mine more than one block).\n\nThe combat is actually fun, with dodge rolls, combos, and blocking mechanics. What's also interesting is the "Style" system, which is essentially Crea's magic-based combat. It's a bit finicky since most enemies move so fast (while you have a casting time), but fun when you get it right. The Style system plays differently in that you need to accumulate a number of charges by casting its base form (heal self, throw fireball, etc). Once you've got enough, then you can cast upgraded forms like fire pillars or ice beams or whatever. Definitely interesting, but gimped since melee is still better.\n\nFor mining, I like that you only need one tool to break the world (well, two: one for breaking stuff, and your hands for picking up stuff in place like furnaces and anvils). It's slow at first, but it's mitigated by the Talent system's upgrades.\n\nCrafting is one of the gripes I have. It's the typical have-these-to-make-that, or have-these-and-be-near-this-to-make that, but the crafting menu seriously needs an overhaul. There's a filter, sure, but it's not very intuitive. I prefer the usual categorization of crafting items rather than having it all out.\n\nGraphics are pretty decent as well. It's like Terraria in terms of tone, but with a much more polished look.\n\nMy other gripe is the lack of purpose. That's true for most voxel games, though, and Crea is no different. "Here's the world, and here's a pickaxe. Bye!" I think it would really improve the experience if the game had towns or NPCs to interact with (talk, fight, barter, whatever). I think the only voxel game that nailed this artificial community aspect was WindForge.\n\n\nOverall, Crea is a lot of fun. It's deeper than other Terraria clones thanks to its skill system, and the graphics are fun. I'd have been all over this game if it weren't for the general lack of purpose.","November 12, 2014","true","4.3"," 13 of 26 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","13","26","0","0"

I find the game pretty freaking annoying.\n\nOnce you go into placement mode, can't get out of it. I hit every key on was still stuck in it (most annoying feature).\n\nYou build a workstation and then you don't know if you're supposed to access it or just be standing over it. I built a workstation, but I couldn't figure out how to access it, and standing right on it, I could still craft the same items.\n\nYou have to swtch between combat and passive mode, however....\nYou can only have 1 weapon equipped at a time. So if you have a bow and want to switch to a melee weapon it's a pain. You have to open your inventory and manually change weapons and hope you don't get killed in the process.\nI had no freaking clue how to use my shield to defend myself (lack of help info). Since there is a skill in there about moving while defending with your shield.\n\nThere's no penalty for dying.\n\nYou can cast heal on your self, but not in combat. So if you survive combat you can heal yourself.\n\nThe hot keys and inventory are pretty small. 2 hot keys for weapons (really only 1, shield is equipped all the time). 5 for passive & 5 for spells.\n\nOn the positive side you can level up your character and skills. However for me it's just not enough to get over the annoyances of the game (expecially placement mode).","November 23, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","3"

From having to reserch items to unlock recipes to lvling up area's to use certain skills and also a very intricate fighting system this has a very well thought out gameplay.

UI is more accessible,  the game feels smoother and the different aspects of the game seem to interact with each other a lot better.\n\nim going to edit the review and say yes, now i recommend the game! it's good to see devlopers actually developing the product :)\n\nthere are still some questions open, and answers to be given to jesson, the dev that commented my review.\n\n1) story development: yes please! crea is still all about its own game mechanics - they have improved a lot but its all about filling progress bars. character development is very nice, but a little story behind it, maybe even quests and campaigns would motivate a lot more - plus it acts like a feedback when you improve levels and skills.\n\n2) character development: yes please! you have a lot of mechanics already, especially for the huge crafting system. thats perfectly fine, the number of skills is vast. but the main characteristics (like agility, intelligence,...) do not feel like having a real impact on the way i play. more limitations and benefits might help, like minimum values for using certain items and skills. e.g.  a high-intelligence character not better in researching stuff than a dumb brute - a high strength character cant carry more than others - a high agility is not necessary for picking locks.\n\n\n3) NPCs and character interaction: the idea of building dummies and dressing them up to get a little company for the main character is a little creepy if you think about it, but works surprisingly well as a mechanic to build your environment. but, will there be other npcs? if so, will you be able to interact with them? will there be dialogue and choices even, especially if you implement stories, big and small? it would be a real asset and a unique feature compared to all the tarrarias, starbounds and the likes out there.\n\nformer review:\n\ndear crea developers,\nunfortunately i cannot recommend this title - yet. As with many early acces titles this one has great potential but it feels a little like things grow over the your heads. i always missed deep rpg elements in similar games but i understand it's difficult to create a whole new terraria or starbound AND add a complete roleplaying system with character development and everything to it. so if it is too much at once, why not mod titles that already exist and really concentrate on your new ideas and things that are really important to you?\nanyway, this is just guessing and suggesting.\n\nhere a few bullets i recommend to improve:\n\n- the gui is not very smooth. for character display this is not that important but the crafting and inventory menus need simplicity, clarification and coherence to be intuitive.\n- the pace feels not right: combat, crafting, moving, mining etc mechanisms need to bebalanced with each other, "speedwise"\n\nAdditionally for the price people are paying for the early access they would expect more frequent updates - not even necessarily regarding real development but at least a post about anyhting you are doing.","January 20, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

Honestly this game has been really refreshing.  I watch one of the programmers, Jasson, on twitch at www.twitch.tv/siegegames.  At first, I honestly thought it was just another terraria clone, but once I started watching him every day and playing the game, it turned out to be a whole lot different.  The character progression really makes this game stand out.  Usually in terraria, what Crea is most commonly compared to, you just beat the wall of flesh then play hard mode and then you have all of the over-powered items and the game isn't fun and you quit. However, in Crea, the progression of the game isn't only based on what enemies you've defeated and what iteams you have, but also what level you are and what skills you've acquired.  I believe Crea opens up a new realm to the 2d sandbox genre and can't wait to see where the modding gets it! Keep it up guys!","February 14","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you haven't played Terraria, its a game that is involves lots of exploring, crafting, building and mining to create new gear, items, and decorations for you and your friends. While Crea incorporates all of the core elements of Terraria, it does so in a different way that allows the game to be unique (mining is primarily done at the surface, and combat is more in depth etc.) While the two games share many assets, I will say that Terraria focuses on exploration and that Crea is focused on the RPG elements.\n\nCrea has a very neat experience system that makes everything count. Every item looted, attack used, or ore mined will increase your characters talent in that profession, allowing for upgrades that can be unlocked. This is great because it allows for player to choose how they want to upgrade their character, focusing on ranged or melee combat, or becoming a healing character. It makes the player feel more invested to build their character for online play, and makes mundane tasks feel more rewarding. The combat in the game is made much more advanced by giving the enemies levels to match the player, and when combined with the endless amount of crafting recipes, there's always another reason to improve your characters gear and stats.\n\nRating:\n8.4/10\n\nPros:\nEXP system keeps the game going, even when it gets slow.\nGraphics look nice with lots of details.\nTakes all of the pros of Terraria, while keeping original.\nCons:   Game may require a wiki to get the best enjoyment.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor PhilipsTrueColor3000TV   Headphones GradoSi80   Keyboard MicrosoftBasicKeyboard10A   Controller SteamController   Mouse RazerNaga2014   Microphone Microphone   Motherboard Motherboard   CPU AMDFX4170Quad-CoreProcessor420GHz   GPU GeForceGTX560SE   RAM 4GBx2CorsairVengence   OS Windows7SP1/Ubuntu14   HDD SeagateBarracuda1TB7200RPM","June 6","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The talent system is something I have always enjoyed in games, and is something that sets it apart from games like Terraria. However, the game still has a ways to go. I fullheartedly believe that the developers have the capabilities to take Crea above and beyond, and am anxious to see how they will do so.","June 6","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","3"
