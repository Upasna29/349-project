This platformer is a debut for German indie studio insayn. How did it end up? Pretty bad, I have to say; let's classify the reasons.\n\nYou control all three characters separately or grouped together, it's up to you but it has its flaws. You can choose each character separately to move through levels redundantly three times (feels more like a boring labor), or you can group them together and risk their death at some parts - the grouping has its bugs and even when they are grouped, they can split but still keep movement locked together. This often leads to unnecessary deaths and requirement for more patience in places with deadly pits.\n\nTo justify the character trio existence (to look more complex and to make up the space for puzzles), every character has a unique skill. Otto can use a pickaxe to destroy stones (just specific ones, you can't make your own way through the levels), Axel can jump higher and Hans... can hold a water in his canteen.\n\nAs for the puzzles, which are the main gameplay feature, they get harder over time but they also treat the player like he would be stupid. I don't know if that's underestimating of the players or just artificial extending of level length, but it's really boring to see the same repeating puzzle pattern over and over again. For example, you have two buttons in front of the gate to open it, and one another button in back of the gate that keeps it open. Guess what you have to do with three characters.\n\nI don't think there's anything special to tell about sounds and graphics, it just looks ugly on higher resolutions. The characters are weirdly slim and tall but we can take it as a part of the game's aesthetics. Also, menu design feels slightly counter-intuitive with controller.\n\nConclusion:Journey to the Center of the Earth could have ended up good with higher budget and more experienced developers. While it can offer difficult puzzle challenges and mediocre length, many players will get bored even before they get there. Level design have many dull and boring parts, and repeating patterns. Even with lower price in consideration, I don't think it's a puzzle platformer that would be worth recommending.\n\n\nDisclaimer: My copy of Journey to the Center of the Earth was obtained for free - I won the game in a giveaway that might have been sponsored by the developer. This fact hasn't changed my opinion about the game (and the review) in any way.\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","March 20","false","4.3"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","72","33","46","6","0"

I love the art style and the 3 different abilities (well, 2 different abilities = the guy who collects water seems to be there to make the levels a bit longer and add a bit more difficultly) make for some fun puzzles.\n\nI do have some gripes though: On the technical side of things, Sometimes blocks you need to use to make jumps with some characters or in true platforming fashion use to weigh down pressure pads don't always respawn if you restart from a check point. Sometimes when you switch character you get a screen but no character - you can hear them moving about but you can't see them. From a game design standpoint it can get quite frustrating with the limited checkpoints redoing a lot of stuff especially if you die from slightly overjumping or underjumping onto (usually) a ladder. I guess once you familiarize yourself with where one "block" ends you can better judge if you've cleared the danger or not.\n\nFor less than £3 this game is a steal, I've played far worse for far more!  That isn''t fair to it actually, at any price it is a genuinely fun experience and I'd definitely recommend it.","September 27, 2015","true","12.0"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","22","30","2","1"

It introduces an aspect that is most famous in GTA V, which is utilizing three characters at once.  Each character has their own unique uses, and best of all, you can "attach" these characters together so you can move all three of them at once.  When these characters are attached, you can use some of their special abilities, such as the pickaxe.\n\nThe music fits in well with this game.  It's not too loud, not too quiet, and far from obnoxious.  I definitely had no issue listening to the music while playing.\n\nThe story/puzzle portion of the game was done pretty well, and you can tell that a lot of time and effort was put into getting the game down right.  I have not read the book this was based off, so I can't add too much in that department.\n\n\nThe only issue I encountered was Axel being a little buggy with rope jumping.\n\nMy one complaint was the inability to change keybindings.  Sure, in this type of game it's not as important, but it's alays nice to have that option, especially if you use a mouse with side buttons.\n\nOther than that, there's not much I can add here.  This was a fun little game.\n\n\n\n\n\nPositives:\n\nNice music.\n\nCheap\n\nNo combat or enemies to worry about.\n\nUse of a buddy system with the three characters.\n\nController support.\n\n\nDislikes:\n\nCan't change keybindings.\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's, and check out our Curators.","April 27","true","2.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It is one of my favorite platformer games and I own over 2,400 games between my two accounts.  Many platformer games that I own are just plain impossible for me to complete due to ridiculously hard difficulty.   This game is very hard but it is not so hard that it is impossible to complete it.   I think the difficulty is fair and I think there is a fair amount of checkpoints in each level.   Talking about checkpoints, the checkpoints in this game are unique.   The first time you walk over the checkpoint it will save the exact status of your game.   So you can use some strategy as to when you want to walk over the checkpoint (which always appears as a sleeping bag on the ground).   You can position your characters wherever you want, and then walk over the checkpoint at the exact point you want to save.   Very neat feature.  Since the difficulty is hard enough in this game that you will die a lot, the ability to control when the checkpoint saves will save you a lot of time.\n\nYou control 3 characters in this game, but I presume you already know that from reading the store page or other reviews.   The game is really fun because at later levels you will need to walk all 3 characters in different directions in the level to find the buttons to move levers and doors.   And you have to cross extremely dangerous obstacles in the process.   The difficulty is hard enough that you will feel challenged in each level starting at around level 5.   The first 4 levels are easier, and are meant as more of a tutorial.     There is a small bug with accessing level 5.   To access level 5, do NOT click on the start button.   Instead hit the enter key twice.    This will load the level.    If you click on the start button, it will lock up.   Hitting the enter key twice should also work if you use a controller, or you could try hitting the A button on the controller twice.\n\nI tried the game with both a controller and the keyboard, and I found the game easier to play on a keyboard because you could more precisely control your characters movement with a keyboard then with a controller.    You need that precise control to get over the deadly obstacles in your path.   I normally always play platformer games with a controller, so this is one of the only platformer games that I recommend playing with a keyboard.\n\nAs I said earlier, this game is extremely fun.   But I wouldn't classify it so much as a puzzle platformer, as more of an "obstacle" platformer.     You spend most of your time trying to locate the right direction to go, and get over the obstacles blocking your path.   The difficulty is very hard but fair, and it gives you a very good challenge.   Also you are on a time system, where if you run out of water then your party dies of thirst.   Since you are being timed (based on how much water you have left), then you will feel pressured when playing the game to rush and move fast so you don't run out of water before you are able to refill the party's canteen.    I usually play a level or two of this game, when I'm in the mood for something challenging in my day.    I will be very sad when I complete the game, and finished all the levels.   But maybe in a few years from now, once I forget the levels, I will go back and play the game again :)   I enjoy the game so much, that I can see myself playing it again in the future.    Also I wanted to note, that I make sure I find the rune in each level I play.   I'm not sure if it unlocks a bonus at the end of the game or not, but I wanted to make sure that I fully complete each level before moving on, and getting the rune is part of each level.\n\nWould I recommend buying this game at full price?    Most definitely yes.    The full price is very low.   The game doesn't cost very much and you will get probably 8 to 10 hours of fun out of it especially if you search for the rune on each level.","April 30","true","14.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

They can move together, or you can choose to control each one separately. The aim is to get past every level's obstacles, and you do this primarily by opening doors & escaping booby traps.\n\nIf any of your 3 characters dies in the level, the entire team will have to restart. As you play, you also have to keep an eye on your thirst level - if you run out of drinking water, your entire team will die. So an added challenge is having to look for water sources so you can replenish your water throughout the game.\n\nBut...\nThis game suffers from some major problems. For instance, in the very first level, if you die and have to restart, a stone block that is crucial to allowing you to overcome an obstacle, is no longer present. So how are you supposed to continue?! You'd then have to start a completely new game!\n\nAnd there seems to be a complete lack of a "save" function. The game claims to autosave, but when I next opened the game, it started me from the very beginning again. What happened to my previous gameplay?!\n\nIf the above problems are fixed, this game would be quite enjoyable.\nFrom my understanding, this game was developed by students for a project or something like that, which may explain the shoddy game development.\n\nI did find the underlying concept and puzzle-solving elements to be quite amusing and fun though, and I also liked the style of the graphics and music.\n\nThis isn't some brainless platformer where you charge ahead and mindlessly blast enemies in your path; this game requires a degree of strategising and planning, yet also precision in controls (especially with the jumping) - I found this balance of required skills to be good, and would recommend Journey To The Centre Of The Earth to anyone who wants an interesting challenge... if not for the gameplay issues mentioned above.\n\nDisclaimer: Game played for free, many thanks to my dear friend Unpageable","May 26","false","0.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

Since I have read the Original Story the whole Game seemed even more interesting to me. You will be able to switch between the three main characters Otto, Axel and Hans. Everyone has his special abilities which you will need to solve different puzzles and to discover hidden ways and secret places. By that you can play 18 different Level.\nI would recommend the Game to anyone that loves platformer since it’s a new alternative idea to play a Game. Also the fact that this is the first Game of a small group of developers gives my rating a bonus since they did their job very good.\nAlso the Controller Support works perfectly fine and in my opinion this is one of the most important things for platformer.\n\nTry to get this hidden Gem during a Sale! I would say its worth a try for arround 2-3$.\n\nRating:\n6.8/10\n\nPros:  New Game Idea\nTells a good story\nFull Controller Support\nA lot of different places to discover\nWorks also on older devices\nWell chosen music\nCons:  The Game design itself could be improved a little bit\nNo achievements and cards\nHardware Information\n\nHardware   Type     Monitor   BENQ 24 inch 1ms    Headphones   Apple Earpods    Keyboard   Dell Basic Keyboard/ Integrated Alienware Keyboard     Controller   Xbox 360    Mouse   Zelotes T-90    Microphone   Integrated Laptop Micro    OS   Windows 7","March 19","true","3.6"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","10","16","0","0"

A feat quite worthy of attention since this is the dev team’s first and so far only project to date. The game itself is a homage to the classic 2D puzzle platformers we’ve grown accustomed to, but it mixes enough elements as to stand out from the generic platformer crowd.\n\nGameplay\nJourney To The Center Of The Earth is a most enjoyable game revolving around large cave levels, rife with puzzles and obstacles to overcome. The platforming sections fit well with the different powers each of the three protagonists posses. Although the game is loosely based on Jules Verne’s classic adventure novel, it takes some liberties from it while managing to offer an authentically fun puzzle game as well. It does not get boring and provides quite a challenge.\n\nIt is in fact, sometimes too difficult. Or better said, it suffers from some diffculty spikes. But that is to be expected from a game that draws inspiration from the many puzzle platformers which preceded it. Not the case to rage quit, but the first few levels were tricky until you have a clear understanding of the characters you control. It does help, the fact that they can be controlled individually, as sometimes it would be near impossible to keep track of them simultaneously. The effort of completing all 18 levels is worth it and the game can part of a speed run, once you get the hang of it.\n\nFrom a graphical point of view, the game might seem simplistic at first sight. At a closer inspection though, the character sprites reveal the amount of work they took and the cave layouts themselves are well made. The two-men team made a stellar job from a level design perspective.\n\nThe game’s sounds and music could have used a bit more diversity. It didn’t quite live up to the the atmosphere of the overall game.The sounds are somewhat generic and the music is too monotonous during the final levels. Still considering the genre and price point, I do believe the sound department to be more of a secondary priority for Journey To The Center Of The Earth.\n\nPros\n+ Classic type of gameplay\n+ Level diversity\n+ Pleasant graphics and character sprites\n+ Steam Trading Cards\n\n\nCons\n- Difficulty spikes require some trial and error.\n- Repetitive sounds\n- No Steam Achievements\n\nResult / Final thoughtsThe game is rather fun to play and the level diversity made me overlook the trial and error parts of it, which can be frustrating sometimes. The gameplay is that of a classic 2D puzzle platformer and having 3 characters to control, each with a different set of skills, is an interesting challenge.The game’s sounds can get repetitive at times and I would have enjoyed to see Steam Achievements. But at least the dev team added Trading Cards to it, nine months after the game’s initial release.\n\nRating 7/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA titles.","June 5","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But I totally agree with some of the other reviews here: The controls are a pain in the a***. I don't have anything against the flickering screens, bad graphics, lame music - as long as the game itself and the controls are both good. But the latter is definitely not:\nJumping from ladders and long jumps over spikes with "small landing areas" are so uncomfortable to handle. Uncomfortable is the right word here and I think I can say that, because I am used to many platform and jump and run games with good controls  (I am playing games since 25 years). It is not difficulty - it is uncontrollability :).\nIf there was a real save option, this "jumping-and-dying-thing" that you experience here would at least be somehow bearable. But there isn't, since there are only checkpoints: So this will force you to repeat everything until you come again to the critical jump (or to the second ciritcal one)...and then you will die again...or you will make it...but as said before: this is not very well controllable and I personally can't enjoy that.\nDear programmers: If you don't wanna change the controls (since this is to big of an effort) you could at least provide a standard save-function.
