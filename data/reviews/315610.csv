Good mix of puzzle solving and platforming, great old school feel. You gain abilities as you play through, for example Might the power to push and pull certain objects etc. You can switch between two characters, Spud and the Prince who is a frog. Tho the prince doesnt do much, but there is parts where you need him to open doors for yea.\n\nThe controls are fluid. The gameplay consists of you going around doing quest for people and going into dungeons, killing stuff etc. The only issue i've found, is the inventory. Nothing big, but its small. You'll find yourself dropping items in order to get other ones. So you have only take what you need. Other then that, I'd give this and 8/10.","July 31, 2014","true","8.9"," 20 of 23 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","20","23","0","1"

Developed by Solo Developer Chris Davis, Spuds Quest sends you on a whimsical journey through an age of gaming gone by.\n\nWhy you should care about it[/b][/u]\n\n\n“Take on the role of Spud and his friend Prince Charming on a journey to uncover four ancient elemental essences that have the power to remove a curse upon the royal family.”\n\nSpuds Quest is a exceptional gem of a game, rarely seen in todays indie scene. It ensnares you from the start; a double punch combination of it’s stunning pixel art and captivating gameplay of yesteryear that will have you ravenous for more. You’ll soon find yourself settling in for a quick game of Spuds Quest after work, only to look up and realize that it’s 6AM and the sun is rising.\n\nYou begin the game as Spud; a small, blue ball man, after being rudely awakened by a frog that fell from the ceiling. Before you can hobble out of your bed and teach the frog a lesson for wrecking your roof, however, it begins to shout at you in a familiar voice. The Prince! This frog is none other than the one and only Prince Charming. After finding out about the Prince’s unfortunate transformation at the hands of an ancient wizard recently freed from a magical prison, you head off to search for answers. You play as either Spud or Prince charming; with the option to switch at any time. Each have their own strengths and weaknesses, and you’ll need to utilize both in order to finish the quest. As you hop, swim and swing around the world of Spuds Quest (Through rain, sun and cloud cover) you’ll begin to unravel the mystery behind the prince’s transformation.\n\nThe Verdict[/u][/b]\n\n\n•	2D Platformer\n•	Adventurous Gameplay\n•	Deep Story\n•	Great OST\n•	Neat weather system\nSpuds Quest is a great throwback to the era of SNES’s and Sega Genesis’s, and will leave older gamers a great feeling of nostalgia from the gorgeously crisp pixel artwork and chiptune soundtrack, and younger generations will appreciate it for all the same reasons. Spuds Quest is one of the best nostalgia throwbacks on offer right now, and you will not be disappointed picking this up.\n\n[Note: I am the original author of the Ambushed Gamer article :3]","July 31, 2014","true","275.1"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VanOccupanther/recommended/315610/","VanOccupanther","Johnny Wheeltrim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VanOccupanther/","801 products in account","Spud's Quest is an absolute gem and incredible value for money.\n\nStory:\n\nThis spud, this potato, this bit of a vegetable, this starchy,\ntuberous crop from the perennial nightshade Solanumtuberosum L. He's\nan every man, an every spud. Just a normal guy, until...a frog falls\nthrough the roof. I know, I know, cliche or what! Passe! But wait,\nhe's no normal frog he's a prince. This frog formally known as prince\nis in a bit of bother, his whole royal family has been turned into\nlittle amphibians by an evil wizard and it's up to you to make things\nright.\n\nThat's your story in a nutshell pretty much, that's your raison d'être\nanyway, but everything else story wise comes from the absolutely crazy\namount of characters throughout the game. Not that is fleshes out the\nstory in any meaningful way in fact most of the characters in the game\nseem almost solipsistic in their narrow mindedness, it's humorous\nthough and it's clear the creator of this game is from the Midlands\n(as am I) the humor is acerbic and very dead pan, I can't actually\nthink of a time a character was glad to see me, quick though they are\nto ask for something, typical isn't it. Anyway, the writing is mature,\nfunny and self aware something you can't say about most games nowadays\nespecially in this genre. I'm gonna knock out a terribly reductive\nword to describe the story of this game, 'charming'. It's true though,\nit's really charming but I mean it in the truest sense of the word\nyou'll know what I mean after playing it.\n\nPresentation:\n\nCHARMING! Oh sorry, where was I, the game looks beautiful, it's all 2D\nand sprite-y with sprites! It feels so thoughtful in the way it looks,\nlike every aspect of the level design was pored over with utter love\nand care. It's a labour of love and it shows throughout. Spud himself\nis a bundle of determination, every aspect of his being shows he's\ncapable of anything,the fact that he's been dragged into all this\npretty much against his will is not enough to put this guy off, all of\nthis shown through some fantastic artwork and this doesn't just apply\nto spud himself, the whole game oozes with character, every screen is\nbeautifully realised and the variety is pretty outstanding, green and\njoyful one moment, dark and decrepit the next. The world that\nsurrounds Spud is expansive and ever full of intrigue.\n\nThe music is also wonderful and evocative, it easily matches the\nquality of the visuals to create a incredibly polished package. That's\nwhats so unbelievable about this game it's created by one person,\nmental.\n\nGameplay:\n\nIt's all good so far, I'd even go as far as to say it's great but\nplatforming games are difficult to perfect, everything has to feel\njust right, it doesn't matter if it looks great, sounds great and has\na good story if your platformer doesn't platform correctly then it's\nall for naught. Thankfully it's super responsive, it feels exacting\nand precise in a way few platformers manage, I'm looking at you\nLittlebigplanet you big load of float.\n\nSpud handles superbly, other than being able to jump he can throw\nthings, when I say 'things' that's because I'm not sure what it is he\nis throwing, but by god can he throw them, and when you throw whatever\nit is he is throwing into water, the water splashes! I don't know why\nthat matters so much but it's the sort of thing you expect to be\nmissing, mainly because it doesn't matter if the water splashes but it\ndoes splash and that makes me happy, okay? He can also climb, pull\nblocks and flip switches he's a swiss army spud. His froggy chum can\nalso interact with things which comes in handy when solving puzzles,\npuzzles play a big part of this game mainly because that's where the\nchallenge comes from. They're bloody difficult too, it also makes this\ngame indefinite in length, who's to say you'll solve a certain puzzle,\nat all! Good luck cheating your way through with a walkthrough and\nbelieve me I tried, at the time of writing this I can't find any\ndefinite solutions, even the people on the Spud's Quest forum talk in\nriddles as to not ruin the challenge. I'm glad of it actually, it's\nhard but fair and 99% of the time the solution was staring me in the\nface but I was just too daft to see it. When you do solve something\nyou either get that lovely warm gloaty feeling when solving something\ndifficult, the rest of the time you feel like a prat for not getting\nit sooner, either way the puzzles are enjoyable in their variety, they\nalso make story sense, you're not unlocking a door by solving puzzles\nwith matchsticks or something silly like that. You're in ancient tombs\nkicking around Goonies style.\n\nBUY IT!","August 5, 2014","true","0.1"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

The screenshots looked really charming and the description really sold me. It draws inspiration from Zelda and Metroid, woohoo! So when it was on sale I immediately got it.\nAnd at frist, it seemed like it was the perfect game for me. It was a nice, dream-like fantasy world and I very much felt like I was a little kid again.\n\n\nSo Spud's Quest is a mix between a Platformer and an Adventure game. You jump around and pick up items to use at other points to continue in the story. There's temples like in Zelda and you gain new abilities like in a typical Metroidvania game. So far the game seems perfect for me. But there's a third title in the description, Dizzy. Which I've never heard of before. Apparently it was an Adventure title where you would pick up items and use them just like in this game. The only problem is, because it was an old game, you could only hold 4 items at a time.\n\nFor some reason, the developer of this game decided to not go with the time and limit your inventory to four slots. So at all times, you can only carry around 4 items. So when you find something new you think you might  need, you need to drop another of your items. Then when you actually need it at some point (or think you do) you need to head all the way back to where you dropped it. At first this wasn't a problem, but after some time it got really annoying. It doesn't help that there seem to be a ton of red herings which you don't actually need.\nNow some of you might be patient enough, but for me it was the reason to drop this game after the third temple (the ice temple). It just became too much of a hassle.\n\nAnother issue I had with the game were the enemies. At first, they're not much of an obstacle. The bats just fly around you randomly, so you can bascically can stand where you are and throw red dots (which is what Spud does as an attack). Sometimes they hit you and after a while you will be at low health. The only way I found to restore yourself is to pay for it with some NPCs placed in front of temples. It's actually quite tedious to go and get healed there. In my opinion, enemies should just have dropped health pickups instead of money to go and buy health with.\nSo the enemies weren't a problem, until SUDDENLY, you meet a new type of enemy, a kind of yeti. Which are way overpowered and caused me to drop down to low health A LOT. Which meant a lot of tedious running back to the healer.\n\nThe final straw for me was how buggy the game got in the third temple. The goal of it was to find babies and bring them back to the entrance. But carrying around the babies and throwing them was quite buggy. They didn't want to go where I thought the game wanted me to take them and in the end, the only way to beat this temple for me was to glitch them through walls.\n\nIf you don't think this (especially all the backtracking and the 4 item inventory) won't bother you, then please, get this game. It does play like a charming game from back in the 16 bit days and puzzlesolving can be quite rewarding. But you need patience.","July 20, 2015","false","7.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","1"

Simple yet engaging, with high-fidelity old pixel art style and a lot to play around. A lot less fun if you were born after 1985, though.\n\nToo bad there are gameplay issues: a few bugs, a dash of illogical puzzles (come on, a crocodile tooth??!!?) and some clunky controls (use Xpadder to map the keyboard with custom sensibility). In a way, those problems constitute a great tribute to old games. Maybe it truly was features.","March 4, 2015","true","10.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I nearly figured the whole game out myself -- everything except the location of that flipping dog bone!  ARHGHG!

I saw it on greenlight awhile back with the promise of a modestly good Metroid-inspired title, and I can overlook the artstyle not being particularly appealing as long as it has good game mechanics.  It does not.\n\nThe gripe with the game really comes down to one thing -- inventory.  The worst part of point and click adventure games is that you don't know what item to use on what part of the game to progress.  This game has exactly that, and has the gall to throw in intentional red herrings that add no meaningful element to the gameplay or story, its there purely for obfuscation.  Its just stupid.  On top of that, quite a few puzzles do not have any apparent or intuitable solution, leading you to wander aimlessly wondering how to progress.  Lastly, there's really no meaningful interaction with enemies in this game.  Its like they are mere placeholders rather than designed to be interesting obstacles.  If the enemies didn't exist, you'd barely notice it except that the character has a strange command where he throws an apple for no reason.\n\nI'm only maybe 1/3rd or 1/4th into the game and don't really want to continue.  The opening is just too much of a lackluster showing, the game isn't fun.  Its also somewhat buggy and the exe hangs on close.  Just pass, it didn't live up the promise.  There's not enough charm or depth in the story, puzzles, or gameplay to warrant a purchase.  The only redeeming factor might be that it might be a good game to speedrun, since I and others discovered some fairly easy OOB glitches that could be exploited (always a plus).\n\nIf I ever finish the game I will go back and update this review.
