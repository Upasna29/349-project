"http://steamcommunity.com/id/swantek/recommended/44350/","swantek","swan3983","http://steamcommunity.com/id/swantek/","75 products in account","I got this game on sale, and I wanted to like this game, I really did. I loved the first GRID. The graphics are really nice, among the best for a racing game when it came out. The single-player story mode is cheesy, but it does okay to fill the gaps between races. The engine sounds are mostly accurate, far more so than the first GRID game. It's really unfortunate that this is where the good parts of the game end.\n\nThe driving physics are awful. Literally some of the worst I've ever played. I understand they wanted to focus on drifting and making it a key component of racing, but it is so poorly implemented that certain vehicles are essentially unplayable. Driving the Koenigsegg Agera R is a nightmare... it feels exactly like driving on ice, which I have actual experience with, living in a place that gets really cold during the winter with tons of snow. It's really a shame that ALL of the cars drift. All of the vehicles, regardless of being described as "Balanced" and / or "Grip" when you select them, will drift, no matter how perfect you try to take a corner. As soon as you hit the brakes, you can feel the vehicle start to fishtail. Some cars are okay, but I've found at least 50% of the time, racing is just not an enjoyable experience.\n\nEven worse is the computer AI. They drive their line and regardless of if they hit a wall, if you bump them, and even if you try to spin them out, it's nearly impossible, they do not make mistakes. It feels exactly like a crappy simulation, minus actually simulating anything.\n\nI did enjoy the first 18 hours or so in the single-player game. Really the coolest part of the game was my second race when I drove up the side of a mountain, fell back down on top of the opponent's car, and still won the race. However, after over 21 hours, I've finally put my controller down in frustration, and most likely will not pick it back up for this game.","September 26, 2015","false","21.5"," 148 of 186 people (80%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","80","148","186","13","4"

Its all about investment in a new league of sport and becoming the number #1 contender and the number 1# fan.\n\nWhat I like about Grid 2 are the tracks. They are fun and challenging to race on in career mode and online. The car personaliztion is near enough good, throwing in real life sponsors to put onto your car and personalize.\n\nI was disappointed with the physics in use of the cars as the developers focused on the powersliding instead of clean turn exits to build better momentum through the corners. You may think thats essential for a great game but the handling will lead you to wreckless driving in most modes challenged on. Online as an example is almost unplayable for these reasons because players cant take full stable control around the corners for a clean race.\n\nAnother thing I was disapointed in was the input controls on the game. For a controller it wont be much of a problem driving cars but for keyboard users it will be. Most racing inputs ive used was the simple w,s,a,d & (Arrows) and have no issues playing them smootly. For Grid 2 its difficult as its not keyboard friendly in a way of keeping your car stable around the corners and attempting most clean races. Ive tried both controller (F710)  & keyboard and its a major difference how you perform in the game.\n\nCockpit is not required in the game which is another downside for a latest racing release. DLC packs have been scattered around as typical developers want more money off you.\n\nPros:\n\n+ Tracks to drive on\n+ Personalztion\n\nCons:\n\n- Controls are unstable\n- Not Keyboard friendly compare to most racing games\n- No Cockpit\n- Codemasters greedy DLC Schemes\n- Graphics are not as good for its age\n\nMy rating: 65/100\nMetascore rating: 80/100\n\nConclusion:\n\nI dont reccomend this game full price for the aspects ive pointed out from it. If steam provide a discount give it a go and see what you think. Hope you make the right decision on purchasing the game.","March 25, 2014","false","69.6"," 143 of 180 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","143","180","0","3"

In 7 hours i've only visited 4 circuits so far, with no serious competition on them (just regular races, with different car classes on the same race), and the handling i'd say is a bit worse than on the first, with they wanting you to drift in every corner.\n\nThe plot of the game is to make a new series of racing globally, taking the best drivers of each part of the world. in each part of the world there are different gamemodes. (guess what: in japan they drift)\n\nThe game also feels like it puts together different vehicle classes and they more or less perform the same (Chevrolet Camaro against a Alfa Romeo 4C comes to mind)\n\nAnd the whole point of 'we have to get fans from social networks to talk about us' with the TV show stuff (The game's storyline, i'd say) just feels for 12 years old.\n\nI'd say they wanted to make the game easier for younger people.\n\nI really liked GRID 1, but this one is average, shouldn't call itself GRID.","December 28, 2013","false","11.4"," 387 of 534 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","387","534","0","11"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/recommended/44350/","tosterx","TosterX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tosterx/","974 products in account","Before I proceed to the review, you should know that personally I'm racing games addict and cars lover from kid. You should know that I raced in many online leagues in reputable simulator: rFactor - it could have been even 800-1000 driven hours. You may ask "why have you stepped back to GRID?" - it's simple: I don't have time for preparations to compete in online leagues (1 race = whole week of training).\n\nHere's where the GRID2 steps in!\nHistory\nGRID2 is the successor of Race Driver: GRID released in 2008, and it represents the same idea.. but somehow better. At first I need to refer into the roots of the first part of GRID - do you remember a game series called TOCA Race Driver? If not, Codemasters produced that series between 1997 and 2006. Because the sales were dropping, Codemasters decided to abandon TOCA and introduce new brand referring to the old product - Race Driver: GRID. I've personally played TOCA Race Driver 3 and I remember that game featured races not only in sportscars but also Monster Trucks and some motocross ones. It was therefore not only asphalt oriented races like the new GRID series. The success of Race Driver: GRID was an indicator to create a new game as GRID2.\n\nSingleplayer\nIn GRID2 you become professional racing driver from rookie just like in Race Driver: GRID. Your first race at Chicago circuit is the tutorial one before you become part of the WSR league (World Series Racing). After first race you're heading into your racing garage. The game features of a manager helping you to start your career. The campaign is very interesting because you start it from the rookie point of view: slow cars (Tier 1). Interesting thing introduced in GRID2 is that after every race you're not rewarded by money. You're rewarded by the number of fans that you got by completing the race. The game makes you feel like you're really important driver in that league. After a couple of races and challenges you need to complete the final one to get into higher tier. Every new tier brings new tracks from all over the world, game modes and of course new cars. Finishing the campaign on the difficulty set to high with all the achievements (50/60 without the DLCs) took me about 30-40 hours of playtime.\n\nFeatures\n* Game modes: Race, Elimination, Checkpoint and Faceoff.\n* Retrospection - the feature known from Race Driver: GRID, gives you the ability to rewind the time and correct your mistakes\n* There are some tracks based on the real life circuits like: Algarve, Red Bull Ring, Abu Dhabi and there are many configurations of the tracks\n* Cars are well balanced with their advantages and disadvantages measured on different tracks\n* Anti-cut-track system which gives you penalty (stop/go) for cutting the track\n* You can always change the difficulty and damage level\n* If you set the damage level to the highest, you can end up the race for example on the wall very easily\n* Very good graphics engine and optimalizations (playable on nVidia 9600 GT)\n* Nice destruction model and detailed statistics about your driver's career like in Race Driver: GRID\n\nPhysics\nThe game physics is demanding and the tracks are very well made with bumps and kerbs affecting the stability of the car. You can't set the details of the physics like traction control or ABS cause the physics is simplified. You need skills to control the situation all over the time. If you make a mistake, you pay for it. The physics gives slight advantage to those who oversteer the car in turns and drift while the FWD cars don't understeer as they should. You need to remember that the grip is changing depending on the surface. I would rate the physics as 70% arcade 30% simulation.\n\nMultiplayer\nAlive with many players as it's the extention of singleplayer mode. There are some moments where there's nobody to play with but that's a rare situation. The MP is hard because you start with the basic cars good for some tracks but bad for others. You need to race in order to receive money and buy better cars. Buying new cars isn't the end of story because afterwards you can modify them (of course by paying money). In the DLCs there are some paid cars that make the competition a little bit unfair. For example Mitsubishi Evo X is probably the best drift car in the game, better than the free ones. The anti-cut-track system is not perfect in some situations because there are places where huge cutting (cheating) won't give you the penalty. It's also popular that the penalized driver (stopped for a couple of seconds) does a very bad thing to others: he directs himselft on the path of incoming opponents to caught them on his bumper. It's also reffering to the culture of players because some of them race only to eliminate others, but it's better than it sounds :)\n\nControllers\nI've tested the game on keyboard and externals: controller Logitech F310 and wheel Logitech G25. The controllers are well discovered and set perfectly. Some cars like Koenisegg are created to be the fastest and hardest so even on the wheel there's a lack of grip on that car and losing control. In general I can tell you that the cars from Tier 4 can be handed perfectly only on the wheel but I disliked doing it in MP.\n\nDrawbacks and issues\n* Anti-cut-track bugs on some tracks\n* Lack of cockpit camera which was in the Race Driver: GRID\n* Lack of the option to change the degree lock for wheel\n* Lack of balancing feature in MP - players are always mixed with different level and skill.\n* The serious issue I have is: problem with not saving the options to the configuration file (it's locked all the time so I can't even read it). I need therefore to change the graphics options everytime I run the game while there's no problem with the settings of controller (they are in different file). I got used to it but I have the same issue in Race Driver: GRID so maybe it's Windows 8.1 related issue.\n\nSummary\nTo sum up the review, in my opinion GRID2 is worth the money. It provides a lot of fun both in singleplayer and multiplayer and on every controller. To this day I still enjoy the multiplayer and I was also invited to drive for one of the Polish leagues - Goes Like Hell. I don't treat it seriously cause I play GRID2 for chillout, but it's the next challenge for me and possibility for players to spend here many more hours.\n\nRace Driver: GRID or GRID2?The 1st part is a little more like simulation so my advice would be: enjoy your playtime at first in Race Driver: GRID and when you'll finish it, buy GRID2 :)\n\nGame tested on:\nAMD Phenom II X4 945, Nvidia 9600, Windows 8.1","August 25, 2015","true","136.5"," 123 of 152 people (81%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","81","123","152","8","6"

I thought your Steam friends are your rivals but no no, only racenets friends are your rivals.\n_ DLC you have not many cars unless you buy the dlc, also some circuits are only available after you buy overpriced DLC (5$, 6$, 10$)\n_ Your car is made of ♥♥♥♥ing polysteren when your opponents car are made of titanium. Ram them while taking a turn you fly away, stick behind them but keep accelerating you'll go at their speed and they wont even flinch. If they ram you during a turn you can be sure you'll loose control of your vehicle. If they're behind you pushing and you try to slow down or break you'll loose control, if you keep at your pace the back of your car will go sideways until you loose control. Driving a muscle car and getting hit by a roadster still makes you fly + damage your vehicle.\n_ Drift cars, the worst thing in this game and there's plenty of race to do with these. The cars keep oversteering.\n_ Pinball effect, if you hit a wall you'll bounce on the ramp on the other side of the road.\n_ Sometimes if you're against the wall and hit a cone your car will explode.\n_ Opponents are driving at your speed, if you're slow they'll be slow. If you're ahead of them they'll catch up with you no matter how perfect you're racing.\n_ Except for you there's never any crash, if you're causing a pile up you'll be the only one ending up off road. The opponents will follow their racing lanes no matter what's happening ahead.\n\nI think that pretty much sums up why i can't recommend this game, maybe these seem like small things but when every races you're the only one loosing control (and not just a little) once there's frictions between you and your opponent that you have to restart or  go back in time every time it gets irritating.\n\nAbout the good things of this game?\n\n_ Graphics are pretty neat\n_ Different kind of events (Touge, Race, Time Attack, Drifts, Endurance, Takeover etc)\n_ Car customisation\n_ Decent career mode.","October 25, 2014","false","24.3"," 169 of 220 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","169","220","2","12"

I've been disapointed with this one. The graphics are improved and the damage model is still excellent. My problem is the handling and physics of the game. They just seem off. I spent most of the time starting out only drifting around turns (I hate drifting). Once I got it more figured out it got better but is still disapointing. Also not to mention that there is a lack of a cockpit view in the game. I got this game on summer sale for a great price and still feel like a wasted my money. There are better racing games out there if you are interested in buying one. I don't recomend this one unless you want to give it a try and don't have to spend much money on it.\n\nUPDATE: So I don't believe many people realize what I'm trying to explain. So let me go into some more details. The game is beatuiful, amazing in looks. The damage looks real and the system for the career looks like it's great and laid out very well. The handling of the cars is what really turns me off from this. It's a cross between an arcade racer and a simulator. This compared to arcade racers is much harder and this compared to simulaters such as Gran Turismo is a joke. If you are willing to tweke settings and work on controlling the car perfectly its worth a buy but if you are just interested in jumping into a car and racing avoid it.\n\nI like my simulators and Iike arcade racing games. Games like GRID 1, Forza, Gran Turismo, Burnout, Need for Speed all have pros and cons. Same with the game it has pros and cons. I tend to fall on a con side not liking this very much. I guess part is I was such a huge fan of GRID 1 that this one has changed so much I dislike it but I would rather play either a true arcade racer that I know what I'm getting or a true Simulator that I know how the car will handle. These crossover games that are an inbetween style I really don't like and hope they will fade out. If you try the game and like it great! If not it's probably a similar reason as me, it's not dedicated to one style of racing games it tries to hit both and misses the mark.","November 25, 2013","false","2.4"," 273 of 407 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","273","407","0","16"

Car control isn't as good as the original and it seems Codemasters has come down with a serious case of "Need For Speed" -Itis.  In other words, The game constantly pushes DLC and relies on a quirky multiplayer engine akin to EA's Autolog.

But people look at it and expect the experience they had with Racedriver: GRID, which this game doesn't deliver.\n\nFirst of all, unlike Rd:Grid the game doesn't allow the player to customize his driving experience.\nRd:Grid was like "you wanna play with keyboard? fine, here is a bunch of assists so you can handle the car with those keys. you get better at it, turn some of them off and get extra enjoyment!" or "ofcourse a car would slide, but only if you are not carefull enough with the throttle in the exit of the corner. still cannot tame it? just move the TC slider a little bit backwards". This freedoms resulted in great accessebility and immense fun of driving whatever you input device was.\n\nInstead, GRID 2 says "we got TrueFeel(tm), we have World SIDEWAYS Racing, we are all flashy and hooked up on fans which you gotta impress, so you are going to play the game OUR way!"\nObligatory drifting. Oh gosh, i didn't think i ever see it this series. Thing is, you cannot tell if you are faster without it. It has  become part of the game.\nAgain, comparing to Rd:Grid, sliding the car was never an option if you were going to set a time. You would go for a clean line, resorting to sliding in rare instances, and yet it was fully up to the player. Sliding a corner made you feel "Hahaha yeah!" or "Oops, steady, steady!". GRID 2 does it like "Right, here we go again...".\n\nNot knowing all that, I jumped into it with my itching fingers ready over arrow keys and was for a surprise. "OK, it won't be easy", i thought, and i got better at it, although still failing to have as much fun as i expected. But i kept my hopes up by thinking, "OK, maybe if i get a controller, i might actualy get to enjoy it...". WRONG. No ingame customization for controller device leaves it almost as clunky as keyboard. (to be fair there might be a way to make it better by editing xml file, but that's yet to find out). As it turned out, reading different forums, the game was desigined primarily for full-on steering wheel controllers, walking straight past keyboards and pads like they are history. Only a handfull of those hardcore devices seem to provide a player with  full control over the car. Yet in a game, that positions itself as leaning towards arcade driving experience...\n\nAnother complaint is the track design. There are not a lot of tracks and locations to choose from. Racing tracks are alright. The trouble hides on city circuits and winding road courses. Like if half-♥♥♥♥♥ controls isn't enough, these end up being littered with hazards, things to hit or send a car flying off the road. Moreover, there simply isn't enough room for 12 hotheads to have their way through, making every game mode a demolition derby. This was not an issue in Rd:Grid.\n\nCoupled with turtle-paced progression of multiplayer, which doesn't reward you for anything besides placing in top 3, you will soon find that if you can't enjoy the driving in this game, there is nothing else left to look for.","March 31, 2014","false","65.1"," 55 of 69 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","55","69","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/44350/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","GRID 2 tries to bring a sort of story element to its career progression. Longtime fans of Codemasters’ racing games might remember the TOCA Race Driver series implementing the same idea. In regards to GRID 2, it’s about one American billionaire called Patrick Callahan, who is launching a new franchise – World Series Racing (WSR) – and has noticed your dazzling skills in the game’s opening introduction race. From there, you become the material to promote WSR across the world and are given the challenge to bring more people to the sport. How do you do this? By beating all the other rivals around the world.An assortment of events populate each season in GRID 2. For example, the first season is set in America and involves racing from point A to point B, but then you move to season three, which is set in Asia and includes events like Touge and Drifting. Along the way you’ll also get to participate in elimination races and overtake challenges. It’s fantastic that the game is throwing a varied amount of events at the player. Making your way through the seasons introduces more powerful cars. Even though GRID 2 includes around 45 cars, it manages to cover a range of types.AI, for the most part, is good and feels to have been given an aggressive characteristic, as these racers aren’t afraid to grind metal with metal with the player. Codemasters has managed to pinpoint that line between realism and arcade racing, allowing anyone who enjoys racing games but isn’t into those that try to represent a serious realism of the sport to come to GRID 2 and get in with humble ease. Online multiplayer is great fun. Players can set up their own playlist of events and what cars to use. At first, the online is limited with its vehicle selection, since the online multiplayer has its own level-up system. Hitting a target level will unlock more cars, which you can then purchase with the earnings you get from taking part in race events online.GRID 2 is a fantastic looking game on the PC. The cars look great and tracks shine with plenty of details. Sound design is brilliant, with loud, roaring car engines blasting out, giving that sense of power coming from high-performance cars.The return of the GRID franchise isn’t as ground-breaking as I would have hoped, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a great racer.","November 22, 2014","true","130.8"," 54 of 68 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","54","68","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/QluPreX/recommended/44350/","QluPreX","QluPreX","http://steamcommunity.com/id/QluPreX/","179 products in account","GRID 2 REVIEW (long).:\nOur GRID 2 review delves into the is-it-arcade-or-is-it-sim racer and tries to stay on the road…\n\n\n\nCrashing looks really good in GRID 2. Really good.\n\nWhich speaks volumes not only about the time and effort Codemasters has put into the near-pornographic squealing and deforming of metal when high-speed car meets wall but also the game itself. You’ll be crashing. A lot.\n\nThat’s because GRID 2 encourages an unhealthy dose of risk to go along with the speed. The handling is parked closer to arcade than simulation, so you can throw the backend of your car around corners at full speed while the tyres screech in pain. Powersliding is the best way to tackle corners but also leaves your car at great risk. Clipping anything mid-powerslide, whether it’s a barrier, rock or even an incline, will send your car spinning out or tumbling tyre over tyre down a ravine.\n\nWhat’s annoying is that clipping other cars will have the same effect, sending you screeching off the road in fear while there's no apparent effect on the car you've just swiped. You can nudge opponents into barriers when the opportunity presents itself but that’s really as aggressive as you can be. Most manoeuvres are met with stiff resistance, as cars simply refuse to budge. It’s like slamming into a brick wall.\n\nThat’s fine – this is GRID 2 after all, not Burnout – except that AI cars hound racing lines so aggressively, you have to respect them and make way unless you want to risk being shunted into a barrier. It feels a little unfair.\n\nGRID 2 – Arcade Or Simulation?\n\nFlashbacks stop this from becoming too annoying. Though it’s not new to have a mechanic that allows you to rewind time, Codemasters has been unusually generous in granting you five Flashbacks to use during a single race. Perhaps it’s just as well. You’ll rarely spend them on correcting your own mistakes but rather, fixing the moments where you’ve been shunted by AI.\n\nBut this comes back to the original point – there’s an unhealthy dose of risk to go along with the speed, which is what makes GRID 2 fun. Powersliding around corners is satisfying thanks to the delicate level of control and it’s the threat of danger from obstacles or other cars that adds a perverse thrill, as you try and make it through unscathed. It’s dangerous, it’s exciting and GRID 2 that encourages you go faster, push your luck and take risks.\n\nWill racing sim fans like it though? Probably not. Although there are simulation elements that come from the actual physics, crashes and weight of the car, this still feels like an arcade racer, with powersliding prompted from any tap of the brakes at high speed.\n\nWith no assists or settings to play around with, racing enthusiasts will be stuck with the arcade feel of the handling and just like auto-combos are frowned upon by fighting game fans, the abundance of Flashbacks doesn’t seem like it will sit well with racing game purists.\n\nIt's also - providing you learn how to tame powerslides and avoid all the obstacles and cars when drifting around corners - a fraction too easy.\n\nBut GRID 2 is an arcade racer, and makes few apologies for it. This feels like the closest an arcade racer can drift towards simulation without sacrificing any of the fun elements and although it’s a tricky balance, Codemasters has just about found it.\n\nIt helps that GRID 2 looks the part as well. The crashes are the obvious highlight for spectacle but more importantly, the stages look detailed and busy. The stages here don’t have the excess of Dirt Showdown, which packed empty sky with fireworks, ferris wheels and other decorations, and yet GRID 2 doesn’t really need them – urban stages have detailed buildings hiding the sky, forest stages dazzle you with light poking through the dense treetops while outdoor levels have cliffs on one side and vistas stretching out for miles on the other.\n\n\n\nGRID 2 - Career\n\nThe majority of your time will be spent powering through the career mode. Codemasters has tried to make it feel more involving by building a rags-to-riches narrative, told through the number of fans you earn as you progress.\n\nThere are lots of nice tricks employed throughout to convey the sense of a race driver building up a reputation – off-screen YouTube footage of your replays, Likes being clicked on Facebook and so on. It does feel modern and adds a nice sense of style to the game, which extends to races themselves - small shunts have an understated effect that looks like camera distortion. It works better than we’ve made it sound.\n\nBut when all is said and done and the flashy cutscenes and tricks have played out, you’re still in a garage, picking races from a menu. It’s a little disappointing, truth be told. Even attempts to liven up the actual game modes themselves such as Endurance or Liveroute feel somewhat standard and pedestrian. There are also further annoying touches, such as the oddly patronising ‘well done pal!’ commentary and the lack of cockpit view.\n\nIt’s difficult to know exactly how Codemasters could push its well-worn racing game template forward without breaking it but this is a world that now has Forza Horizon, Need For Speed: Most Wanted and Gran Turismo 5 with their own distinct personalities and takes on career mode. GRID 2 has the style but not the substance. Career mode doesn’t feel special enough to stand out from the pack.\n\nIt’s a shame because the racing itself is surprisingly accommodating for those who aren’t dedicated petrolheads, thanks to its arcade-style powersliding, generous number of flashbacks to correct mistakes and the horrific yet compelling visual crunch of the (many) crashes.\n\nIt’s just the dedicated racing fans who might feel left out here, as the handling drifts closer to arcade than simulation and with no settings to redress the balance. GRID 2 is fantastic if you're not huge on racing games and want to experience the thrill of them without putting in the hours and yet that same lack of depth across career mode and the handling will be what puts the more serious racing fan off the title.\n\nScore Breakdown:\nGraphics         8.5 / 10\nSound             7.0 / 10\nGameplay       8.0 / 10\nLongevity        7.0 / 10\nMultiplay         7.5 / 10\nSCORE:           7.5 / 10\n\nFinal Verdict Accessible if a little shallow, GRID 2 has plenty of arcade racing fun for those who aren't too familiar with the genre but might disappoint hardcore racing fans thanks to the familiar career mode and lack of settings.","November 29, 2013","true","51.7"," 129 of 190 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","129","190","0","1"

The Online Multiplayer Racing can be fun and enjoyable once you get the hang of the driving style that the game brings to the table and also when you make friends with a bunch of other respectable racers also... The sad things about the Online is that it is dying (I suggest you switch your download region on steam to London-UK to find more people) and there are those occasional hackers every now and then that can ruin the fun, but I enjoy the hell out of this game and playing with my racing buddies... I would recommend you buy this game when it is on sale, the $50 price tag for the reloaded edition is kind of expensive when you look at the age of the game.

That about sums up the positives.\n\nThe physics, oh boy. To be quick, you have to drift, which in itself goes against ANY logic, at least on tarmac. And the way you drift is moronic as well- the car just steps out, no matter what you do. If you try driving sensibly, you understeer like you're running bald summer tires in snow. If you don't want to do so, you have to drift, but how can you do it properly when throttle control basically doesn't exist? It just boggles my brain that a game of this pedigree can handle worse than Mario Kart 64.\n\nThis is the worst driving game I own by far.

If an opponent touches you your car will, nine times out of ten, spin out and you lose a ridiculous amount of ground. However, if YOU touch an opponent, you'll still receive the brunt of the damage and time lost. The AI relies wholly on rubber-banding too - drive badly, they will be more forgiving, drive well, and they'll go toe to toe with you. The gamemodes are generally enjoyable. The problem is how the game creates progression late-game. Instead of new tracks, the game simply extends old ones, or, by season 5, makes you do the same 6 mile course three times over. This wears thin quickly, and the endgame feels more like a grind than an edge-of-your-seat world championship.\nThe game looks nice, the tracks are nice - hell, the cars are nice (if you're prepared to drop upwards of $5 to use the good ones). But when the actual gameplay is as infuriating as GRID 2 is, it really isn't worth your time/money - particularly at full price. I happpened across my copy in a Humble Bundle, and I'd be wary of paying any more than the $4 I shelled out for that bundle on this game alone.","December 14, 2014","false","27.4"," 47 of 66 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","47","66","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerocrane/recommended/44350/","aerocrane","aerocrane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aerocrane/","593 products in account","This game is not like any other Codemasters racer. They went full on Arcade this time, with a big focus on drifting. A normal race is more about drifting around corners than about finding the fastest racing line. It is almost like OutRun, you just are slower if you don't drift your way around corners. The rewind feature makes a return, further solidifying the arcade direction the series has taken with this sequel.\n\nThere is no cockpit view or car setup and tuning options are minimal and only available in multiplayer. Multiplayer may appear deserted and it does suffer from low population because of matchmaking regions being based upon your Steam download server's location. There is a lively multiplayer community, but to play with more people you need to change your Steam download region to UK - London and preferably also own all of the DLC packages to get better matchmaking.\n\nIn multiplayer your goal is to gain money and experience to level up to unlock new cars and upgrades which you then have to buy with the money you earned. Your multiplayer experience can be a mixed bag then in itself. In "Playlists" there is no voting on game modes or choice of circuits, instead the lobby is assigned a random track, car tier and gamemode. Players then have the ability veto the combination once. If the combination is vetoed you are assigned another random combination without the ability to veto it.  There is also the "Custom Events" option which are events hosted by other players. You gain less money and experience from participating in "Custom Events," and only the lobby host can decide the settings of the event. The host has a wide variety of changeable settings, varying from type of event to forcing every player to use manual gears. There is a system called "Impact Ratings" in the multiplayer, which shows other players how dirty their opponents race. These are represented by circles with exclamation marks in them, with the ranking going White-Green-Yellow-Red from the best to the worst. Players with too little data to assign them an "Impact Rating" show as grey. The rating persists over races, and can change over time. Lots of online races tend to have people crashing into each other a lot, so do not pay too much mind to your "Impact Rating." When "Impact Ratings" are enabled, you gain a small cash bonus at the end of the race based on your rating.\n\nAlso available in the Multiplayer menu are the "Global Challenges." These are a set of random events raced on certain circuits with either a certain Tier of cars or a specific car. Instead of racing head-to-head with another player, this game mode is leaderboard based. The game tracks your performance in the events and compares your scores to your friends. The person on the top of the leaderboard is considered to be leading the event. There are medals on the events, granting you small amounts of money and experience for passing their requirements. Based on your position on the leaderboard in the specific events you gain points for the overall leaderboard which shows who among your friends is the best racer overall. The set of events changes every few days with the leaderboards wiped at the same time.\n\nThe "Singleplayer Career" mode casts you as the rising new talent in the fictional new racing series called World Series Racing or WSR for short. In the singleplayer you proceed through "Seasons" of the series, completing events and unlocking new cars from challenges. As you progress through the career you gain access to more exotic cars, going from the old muscle cars and small European hatchbacks of Tier 1 to immensely powerful and rare cars like the Koenigsegg Agera R in Tier 4. The car selection has more of an emphasis on normal street legal cars rather than Touring Cars and the like. There is no Circuit de la Sarthe or the LMP class cars to be found in this game. The circuit selection varies from fantasy street courses to real life race tracks like Brands Hatch, Indianapolis and Yas Marina. Unlike the multiplayer, the cars are simply unlocked by completing separate challenges, and cannot be upgraded. The looks of the cars can be customised with paint colour, vinyls, wheels and sponsorship logos. The sponsors also have specific challenges for you to complete. Your progress throughout the career is tracked by the amount of "Fans" you have. You gain fans from completing sponsor objectives and placing well in events. The "Fans" statistic is hidden in Codemasters' "Racenet" service in the multiplayer, and has no real effect on that part of the game.\n\nI don't like how the AI can nudge your car around but you really can't do the same to them. I played the game mostly on Medium difficulty, and it is easy if you just race very physically, using the other cars to navigate corners. The AI gets really challenging on Hard and becomes a far more frustrating experience. In my opinion there is noticeable gap in the AI skill between Hard and Medium that really shows in the way they react to you driving aggressively.\n\nGraphically GRID 2 looks very impressive. The crashes look nice with parts flying off and shrapnel scattering all over. The stages look nicely detailed: urban stages have detailed buildings surrounding you as you race down the streets. Forest stages look threatening with hills and dense forest just outside the track, ready to punish from the slightest mistakes with formidable damage. The game is also very well optimised and runs well even on older hardware. Sounds are probably the weakest part of the game, with similar engine sounds for most of the cars and a very annoying tire squeal sound effect. There is also the sound of crowds cheering, but beyond that ambient sounds are nonexistent.\n\nGrid 2 is a solid arcade racer with great graphics, but is sadly hamstrung by its emphasis on drifting over real racing lines, stagnant AI and multiplayer which frequently devolves to a demolition derby. Fans of more arcade racing games like the Need For Speed series will find much to like here, while fans of the more realistic approach of the first game should give this game a pass.","February 9, 2014","true","59.7"," 50 of 74 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","50","74","0","0"

For PC, I must say that the GRID series, minus the first game, is phenomenal. GRID 2 deviates from its prior by balancing simulation-level damage and graphics with arcade-style racing. While there are a few things that were missed, such as an in-car view, the huge selection of vehicles, tracks, and environments make this game really stand out.\n\nSingle Player CampaignGRID 2 has a fantastic storyline. You are a new driver, trying to make a name for yourself and your racing league, WSR. You're led by the confident Patrick Callahan, who keeps you up to date on promo events, passing in races, and reminding you of sponsor objectives. The game is split into "seasons," with each season taking place in a different region. At season 4, you race at tracks globally. In general, each season means a new tier of cars, but there is some overlap, making seasons 3 and 4 both T3 races. There are difficulties suitable for anyone, from racing newcomers to GRID experts. There are multiple race types, such as Endurance, Time Attack, Overtake, Drift, Race, Touge, and more, all of which are very enjoyable. The only caveat I find with any of the game modes is when playing Touge, the aggressiveness of your opponent will count against you, even if they hit you. Just avoid aggresion in this mode, and you'll be fine.\n\nOnline MultiplayerThe GRID 2 community is alive and well, and the forums are still relevant. Performance is great online, and you can upgrade your cars to suit your own driving style. If I remember correctly, multiplayer lobbies can go up to 12 players at once, but please correct me if I'm wrong. Even when you beat the Single Player Campaign, you will still have loads of fun in online multiplayer.\n\nReplay FactorOne of the things that I look for in a game is whether or not it is enjoyable to play a second time, after you beat it once. I must say that this is one area where this game excels. I often found myself retrying races with different vehicles to beat my lap times, rise in the leaderboards, or just to see the difference each made.\n\nControls and Graphics GRID 2 supports a wheel & pedals setup, but I simply use a keyboard. While there are disadvantages to doing so, i.e. pressing W is equivalent to going pedal-to-the-metal 24/7, the steering is very managable and drifting is easy to pick up on. The graphics are fantastic. I don't quite know what graphics engine this game runs, but I play the game on Ultra settings at 50-60 fps on a GTX 860M. It's optimized incredibly well, and lighting, shadows, and reflections all look great. You certainly won't have weather effects anywhere near games such as Project CARS or Assetto Corsa, but the game will be just fine for the vast majority of players.\n\nValue I purchased GRID 2 on Steam during the 2015 Summer Sale, but I did have it installed previously. Feel free to add about 15 hours to my Steam timelog for it to make up for this. You can pick it up for USD $7.50 as of writing during this "North Pole Noir" sale, and you certainly won't regret it. There are  number of DLC packs, all of which I personally do own but don't use very often. I feel like Codemasters hit the sweet spot with the DLC attractiveness, as there are plenty of cars in the base game that will outperform the DLC vehicles, but some of the DLC packs offer more vibrant patterns. For example, the base game's T3 Honda will outperform the T3 DLC Camaro SS, but the Camaro SS is a fantastic looking car. The reloaded edition of this game is probably the best deal you will get, at least when it is on sale.\n\nHere's a rundown of each aspect of the game and how I would personally rate it.\n\nAspect        Rating                Physics        10                Plot        10                Damage        9                Multiplayer        10                Community        10                Graphics        10+                Value        8                Overall        9.5\nFinal Points on the Game Not only is GRID 2 the best racing game in its class, the unique storyline makes up from something looked over in most racing games.

The game can be fun, but it might be frustrating either.\n\nFirst of all: the sngle player mode. Basically your goal is to beat Harrison Carter (a bot), who always finishes first or second (if you're first). The rest of bots is always drunk so don't even mind them. A car driven by AI which is in front of you is always slower than you. It can't drift, never puts pedal to the metal. Is it easy to overtake them? Of course not. The roads are usually so narrow that you're usually blocked by AI cars. If any other car touches yours or you touch it, you'll instantly spin out so don't even try to crash the bots. And here goes the magic! Whenever a car driven by AI is behind you, it starts driving like a pro: never uses break, never reduces speed, never touches anything (and if so, its car isn't damaged at all). It overtakes you in a moment and then it becomes the slow one again. Oh and the best thing, you always starts from the second to last position so have fun with being blocked by cars in front of you and being bumped by cars behind you.\n\nThe multiplayer is totally unfair. Guy who starts from better position (especially the first and the second) has always a huge adventage. If he is as good as you, and has a good car you have no chance to overtake him.

This is not a very good system but in Grid 2 they have moved to an even worse system where each stat of performance is a bar. This makes comparing cars virtually impossible. not to mention the majority of cars share the same statline.\n\nthe cutscenes are cringeworthy, They strike right into the heart of the "old white man trying to appeal to young kids of the digital age" as if the game is almost a parody of itself. The ESPN sections are especially cringeworthy, i wonder how much their paid for licensing to an american only complay for an american live action cutscene THAT IS UNSKIPPABLE.\n\nAtleast they have done away with the horrible sponsor screen from GRID 1. that would take  way too long to scroll. Grid 2 allows you to skip alot of parts.\n\nPros:\nMore cars\nUpdated Graphics\nPost-Race Sponsor rundown\n\nCons:\nPhysics is terrible\nunskippable cringeworhty cutscenes\nPhysics are awful\nAI is on rails & cheats\n\nThe game is legitimately not fun to drive in.\nBy far the worst event is the random track events without a co-driver or minimap its a random chance that a corner is a hairpin or open. you have to take every corner at slow speed.\nAlot of other events are 1-3 laps meaning you have no time to learn the circuit at all.\n\n\nTLDR: its not Grid 2. Its bootleg need for speed.

First I will start with the cons.\n\n-Firstly, NO DRIVERS CAM? What kind of racing game doesn't have that!? Even Colin Mcrae which was a 2000s' era game had it! I get the feeling this isn't a simulation game but more of an arcade.\n-Secondly yes the realism. The damage model is excellent, smashing into things has never been so fun. But lacks, tire wear and rain? Can't change car setups in career mode unless its hidden? I have looked.\n-Thirdly Racenet... I am logged in, but I cannot for the life of me, figure out why my times don't show on the friend scoreboard in career mode, I have tried logging out and back in but no cigar. As a competitive racer, I is sad about this.\n-Lastly the price of the All In DLC is way too expensive for a game which is now dead. By dead I mean, I cannot find a single online race. I won't waste money on unlocking cars I cannot use.\n\nOK now for the pros!\n-Firstly I'm more of a grippy guy so seeing a variety of cars is great! I get such a rush from using the Caterham, it grips so well and it flies.\n-The graphics are beautiful and at max settings I never dip below 60fps\n-The career mode. What can I say, an immersive story in which you are a racer working up through the ranks with goodies like unlocking cars  watching the protagonist gain social media attention and fans, The AI provide a challenge even though I have yet to lose a race or even finish second (Hard difficaulty, damage on, flashbacks on)\n\nMy conclusions is, as a racing fan who always leaned towards Formula One, it was nice to get back to actual road cars. Please remember this is my review, my opinion. I'm sure you think differently and you will let me know in the comments.","October 3, 2014","true","23.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","0"

I didn't try playing it with a controller, but I do know that this game is designed to be controller friendly.\n\nI found this game to give a really fun racing experience without being punishingly difficult or realistic. Unlike games that are designed to be simulations first, it really feels like GRID 2 is designed to be a fun game first.\n\nThe fun comes from a few things.\n\nFirst of all, the racing does really feel "intense" - this comes through thanks to all the great visuals and sounds. It's not easy to describe, but there's just loads of polish on the overall aesthetic. The wide variety of levels and locations really helps here as well.\n\nSecond of all, they have lots of little ways to prevent you from getting frustrated. My favorite mechanic is the flashback mechanic - it basically lets you rewind time to undo a mistake you made. This is really great because not only does it prevent you from going "oh no, I need to restart the whole race...", it also gives you the opportunity to learn much more quickly. There's a limit to how many times you can do this so it doesn't make the game too easy. Furthermore, they have a wide range of difficulty settings for all levels of experience. I have only played a few racing games and found the Easy difficulty to be decently challenging without being frustrating. Finally, they have this guy who is talking to you all the time who will ocassionally offer useful suggestions and keep you focused on what to do during a race (and it doesn't get annoying, in my opinion).\n\nThird, the overarching story of trying to get fame for the WSR feels like a pretty significant goal. There's lots of different ways you can advance the story (for example, if you don't like a particular type of event you can focus on other types of events).\n\nMy major issue with the game is that, towards the fourth WSR series, I felt like the content was becoming a bit same-y and it started to feel like a bit of a grind.\n\nOverall, if you are interested in having a fun racing experience as a change from a hardcore, realistic racing sim, this game is pretty fun. I haven't played many other PC games in the genre, though, so take this recommendation with a grain of salt.","November 14, 2014","true","9.2"," 20 of 31 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","20","31","0","0"

The damage system is spectacular and racing your friends is always fun. All the cars handle like a dream. The engines sound like the real thing. The only thing that I was disappointed in was the game doesn't have a cockpit view (inside the car) and you can't upgrade or tune your car in anyway in singleplayer but you can customize your ride like change rims, tire size, colors and decals. Multiplayer on the other hand you can tune your car making it faster. I hate how this game has so much DLC because if you own a certain DLC and your friend doesn't you can't play it with them making that new DLC useless unless you want to play it by yourself.

Racing is centred around street circuits, permanent racing venues and a few single stage like events.\n\nThere is a wide variety of events available from straight races, time trials, checkpoint races, endurance (7 whole minutes at a time!), drift, eliminator and others.  The best of these is the “liveroutes” events that occur in one of the major cities.  The route is randomly chosen when you start a race and the mini-map is disabled resulting in you having to pay attention to the upcoming corner to judge entry speed.  Though once you have been playing the single player portion of the game for a while it does become easier as the locations while appearing huge are quite limited in how many layouts are available.\n\nThe game is absolutely beautiful though, from the various locations like Paris, Hong Kong and Barcelona to all the car models and how damage appears on them.  The game also performs admirably on even modest machines.\n\nMy biggest issue with the game is how the cars drive and more importantly how the AI cars drive.  Cars come in two varieties, tail happy and not, that's about it.  Front wheel drive cars drive like front wheel drive cars, four wheel drive cars are glued to the road and for rear wheel drive it's seemingly random whether it's glued to the road or wants to head for the bushes at every corner.  This behaviour tends to drive you to only driving a couple of cars like the Caterham LMP-like track car the Audi R8 LMS.\n\nThe opposition AI is also an issue.  Instead of allowing the AI to drive the track and react to conditions and you as they appear, the AI cars seem to be pre-programmed to move around the track in a certain way like robots.  It's frustrating in many ways as you end up making the same passes all the time as you quickly become aware of their weaknesses.  There are also some bizarre changes in difficulty, some races are ridiculously easy on the highest setting while others are quite hard on the lowest.  Both these criticisms could be made of just about every Codemasters racing game, maybe with the next Dirt or Grid they could concentrate on AI?\n\nAll in all this is a very decent Arcade racer, it doesn't do anything new or exciting that is deserving of paying full price, but is a good way or wasting a few hours here and there.","March 22, 2014","true","23.5"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

It's very drift friendly - perhaps for the younger generation - and sometimes I like this and sometimes it seems my car breaks into a slide purely at random.\n\nSingleplayer - Seems to be 90% city courses so far (I'm most of the way through tier 3) with only the occasional time trial on decent real world circuits, which might be quite a disappointment for Race Driver: GRID fans.

The game however has settings that add more manual handling control to the user, but the gameplay itself lacks realism. The game main campaign might look interesting for the first few races, but then it gets too repetitive,  every time it's the same venues, the tracks are just slightly different from one another when racing in the same place or are exactly the same you played on before, very poor variablility. Also, some events are ultra repetitive as you have to run in the same track over and over, and do not add anything different to the gameplay.\n\nThe multiplayer part of the game is fun at first, but levelling up was taking a lot of time and made me lose interest on keeping racing on every same track all the time. Also finding a lobby with a lot of people is not an easy task, maybe this can vary with the region of the world. The good part about the multiplayer is playing with friends and laughing about the mistakes and crashes.\n\nOne thing very annoying is shoving in your face the "add-on" cars (DLC) when you go to select your car to play. Add-on cards should only be shown if I had the cars, not telling me to purchase them. If you want to advertise it in the game, make it so in the main menu... By the way, they added a "Reloaded" edition, which is just the same base game with all the DLC included in a single package, another way to milk more money out of DLC.\n\n\n\n\n--------\n\nPortuguese translation:\n\nO jogo é bem feito, tem belos gráficos, cenários e efeitos sonoros são muito bons, mas o jogo é muito arcade, bom para o público geral que não joga bem jogos de corrida (eu incluso nisso). Porém o jogo permite configurações que permitem maior controle manual por parte do jogador, mas mesmo assim o jogo não prima em realismo. A campanha principal do jogo é interessante no início, principalmente nas primeiras corridas, mas daí em diante se torna repetitivo demais, são sempre nas mesmas cidades, os circuitos mudam muito pouco mesmo quando o modo de corrida muda, muitas vezes são os mesmos circuitos/traçados, a variedade é bem fraca. Os eventos em si também são bem repetitivos, muitas vezes você tem que correr na mesma pista várias vezes, e nada de diferente é adicionado à jogabilidade.\n\nO modo multiplayer é início no começo, mas subir de level parece muito lento e me fez perder o interesse em jogar online nos mesmos circuitos de novo toda hora. Encontrar uma sala com muita gente também não é tarefa muito fácil, de repente falta jogador se for dividido por região. O legal do multiplayer é jogar com amigos e rir dos erros e batidas.\n\nUma coisa bem chata é ficar mostrando toda hora os carros "add-on" (DLC) quando você vai selecionar o seu carro pra corrida. Esses carros opcionais só deveriam ser mostrados caso o usuário tivesse a DLC, não ficar toda hora mostrando que pode comprar, é irritante. Se quer fazer propaganda faça no menu inicial... A propósito, eles lançaram uma versão "Reloaded" que nada mais é do que o mesmo jogo com todas as DLCs inclusas num pacote, outra forma incentivar a prática caça-níquel de DLCs.","May 28, 2013","false","19.5"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","2"

Since there were a lot of folks that pre-ordered it too, you'll be able to use those cars on a regular basis in the public lobbies.  Both the Mclaren and Mercedes DLC cars for TIER 4 are the ONLY upgradeable ones.  You can not upgrade any other DLC cars.  Also, the GT-R pack is good because it gives you a good option to be competative in Tier 3 when you are starting out as a low level driver.\n\nAs far as multiplayer goes, just make sure you set your download region to a European server (since the game is region-locked).  If you are looking forward to drift mode like the one from GRID 1, then be prepared to be let down.  Because of the new physics engine, it's nothing like it's predecessor.  But I like the racing portion a lot though.  The reason why I liked the GRID 1 was because all the cars had the SAME SPECS.  So the only thing that defines the winner is skill and the racing lines the driver takes to get to the top.  With the upgrade customization aspect thrown into the mix in GRID 2,  it's now about which setup get's you the best performance in the car along with what lines you take.  As you meet faster racers, you'll learn what are the best setups for the best car in each tier or, for me, the best setup for your driving style.  Add in the "active obstactle" for the mental game of how are you going to pass this racer cleanly for an extra challenge.  Also, if you are pretty confident in your skills and are in a room full of noobs, you can challenge yourself by giving the noobs a 10 second head start.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/EyZzJkx4_6U\n\nWhen I mention "active obstacles" I'm of course referring to the dirty racers/rammers in multiplayer.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOQL5fqmN3d40Z2d8rCGHfWp6aeEGlEB\n\nSo if you are looking to find some close races\n\nhttp://youtu.be/WL12RNeSp98\n\nor test your skills in dodging pile ups\n\nhttp://youtu.be/NqYkR88q4Uc\n\nand clean overtaking\n\nhttp://youtu.be/RPTpXhpjGSE\n\nThen I look forward to seeing you on the track.","December 30, 2013","true","699.7"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","2"

The cars spin so freaking easily and its impossible to overcome a spin or control it. If you so much as touch someone, you spin, if you touch a wall you spin, if you do anything you spin. Trying to drift is nearly impossible, as soon as you start to slide, it's like a bar of soap sliding on the bottom of a wet bath tub. Honestly phone racing games have better handling this. 3/10\n\n- Performance\n\nI don't know if this is my own fault, or what but after playing the game for 10 hours the performance decided to jump off a cliff and I know it's not me playing on a weak PC, I play Shift 2 above 60 fps no issue at all on max. If it wasn't for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performance, the graphics would be really good. 4/10\n\n- Difficulty\n\nI don't want to play a game that is so easy you dust everyone, but damn its nearly impossible to win even if the game didn't have the ♥♥♥♥♥iest handling ever. If all of the AI have the same car as you, they are still way faster in all ways despite them owning the EXACT same car as you. It makes winning more of a hassle than fun, you end up restarting the event over and over again until either you wreck one of the AI or they do something stupid and you get extremly lucky. 2/10\n\nIf you want a nice looking track racing game, just get Shift 2, it's a lot better and cheaper, you even get all the DLCs for free.","April 3, 2015","false","14.2"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","17","28","0","0"

I could train myself to handle the cars this way, but I don't want to change my habits for just one game.\n\nMind you, this IS an ARCADE STYLE racing game. I shouldn't have been expecting realism. If you like more realistic handling (i.e. actually braking before cornering), try Grid Autosport.\n\nI bought this game with all the DLC, wish I could get all the money back but it's too late.\n\nI really want to like this game, and I had some good times with it in the beginning, but soon I realised that it's not meant for me.","October 25, 2015","false","11.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Just keep in mind that it's not a racing simulator like GRID. It's Need for Speed: Greatest Hits. I can see huge chunks of various NFS games put into the game nicely like Touge on the California Dixon track at night is a canyon race from Carbon, sponsor decals, body and performance mods are from Underground, circuit races strongly remind me of ProStreet. Cote d'Azur track alone reminds me of Porsche Unleashed and brings a smile to my face. Codemasters made a great arcade racing game.\nStrong sides of the game: gorgeous graphics, awesome physics in terms of car behavior, great online matchmaking, single player campaign is fun to play and interesting to progress, AI can be easily adjusted to a desired difficulty.\nMinor complaints that I have: there's no way to change the in-game assistant's voice. Personally I really dislike that voice and ended up muting it. Many games have an option to change the voice that talks to you while you play 'cause it's important! You're stuck with this voice for hundreds of hours. In Crysis I was able to choose the voice of the nanosuit (male/female/robotic), in PAYDAY 2 and SR: TT there're similar options. The DLCs certainly crippled the game. Extra tracks and cars just don't fit in properly, e. g. you can't use Ford Sierra RS500 online and nobody races on Bathurst unless you create a custom lobby and invite friends to play it. The lack of cockpit view is an insult. I also miss Ferrari, Lamborghini and Porsche cars, but don't get me wrong, there's a lot of cars to play with.","February 5, 2014","true","92.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

It has better music and better graphics. A race in Algave on a sunny day is really beautiful. A richer car list than GRID, including those breathtaking racing cars and those flashing super or hyper car. The idea of WSR is also great, getting drivers from all over the world, from different clubs, having different driving style to race rogether is great fun.\n\nBut seriously, because you're the post boy of WSR, and your job is to attract those racers to take part in WSR, you'll have no chance to take part in 24h Le Mans. And for this you're saying goodbye to those stunning prototypes, which is a great lost for me. Well they left me a SP300R though.\n\nSo since I won't recommend this game to anyone else, how imperfect it is? Well, the career mode, I'd devide it into three parts, the boring part I like a game of NFS, the best second part and the total nightmare of the third part. Why is that? The cars in this game are divided in to three types: grip, balanced and drift. Sounds reasonable, right? But the problem is, GRID2 didn't have a right idea of drfting, and made drfting literally spinning. It's alright at first, when your cars are always slow so you can remain in control. But that makes it feel like NFS. When you're going into Europe, grip type of cars appear. You'll find them funny to drive, with sometimes a little bit of slide, you'll have a lot of fun in driving. But when it comes to the later part of the game, especially when you have those Tier 4 super car. The spin on those super car becomes uncontrollable, so when you are racing in HongKong or Co d'Azure, you'll have to go carefully (and slowly) to avoid spinning and crashing. And even worse, only one of the super cars is grip type. The problem is caused by the poor physics of this game, like everyone else said.\n\nAnd then, BOTs. Thanks to spinning, the Koenisegg Agera R is literally undrivable. But, you'll find out those BOTs will drive this car like a gust of wind, no crashing, no spinning and don't even slide! And like GRID, BOTs of GRID2 like crashing too. That Bruno Silva guy, before the race the radio will tell you he's so agressive and always crashing others, so he hit me, well, I can't blame anyone because they warned me the guy was dangerous. But when they tell me Eliminaciόn drivers are afraid of trade paint, those guys still crashed on me. My face was like "dafaq" as I was spinning. So since those BOTs made you so upset, why not spin them out or crash them out of track to take some revenge? No, you won't move them a little bit. If they crash you, you'll spin, and if you crash them, you'll spin too! And in two racing type the BOTs made themselves boss there. One of them is touge. In touge competitor will take penalty for hitting other driver. But in GRID2 it's directly disqualified. And here is the problem. If you crash them, you'll get disqualified, that's the rule. But if they crash you, you're still getting disqualified. Simple. The other one is drifting race. Drifting race is literally a series of jokes in GRID2. Just get behind one of your competitor and see how they drive and you'll find out that it's no even sliding, just driving fast through every corner like a normal race. And when you get to the finish you'll find out that they still have a decent score for that. Drifting itself is a joke in GRID2, drifting race is a series of jokes.\n\nIn career mode you can test drive your cars. But it's only one lap only in Indianpolis. So in real life it's reasonable because those race track will charge you for using their tracks. If you don't have much money you won't be able to go like 10 laps on the track. But come on! If you can't drive those racing car on the race track freely, why are you still playing it? Are we playing a race manager simulator rather than a  race driver simulator, if it ever is?\n\nAnd, well, no Nürburgring, even worse.\n\n5/10, for the middle part of the career mode is a lot fun.","February 8","false","51.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","6"

As well for tracks, cities, landscapes or cars, although the choice of Japanese and American is excessive. Here, neither Porsche, Ferrari, nor Lamborghini, etc. (And Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo or other AMG against which you run in WSR, are not available in DLC) But the principal critic to do to this game, it's that instead of being called “GRID 2”, it should be called “DRIFT 2” so much ALL the cars drift, in spite of medium settings. Some are almost impossible to handle, like Ford Sierra 500, Pagani Zonda Revolucion, McLaren MP4-12C, Honda NSX-R or Koenigsegg CCGT. Even the Dallara Indy with its slick tires drifts ! What is incredible for Racing Cars which should remain like on rails ! But at the opposite, others cars are totally understeer like the three types of Nissan GTR, the Ford UTE or the brilliant Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (With these cars, take care to the size choice of your rims !) And let's not speak about the non-existent braking of almost all the cars except this little fabulous Subaru Impreza, the ridiculous engine sound of some, or the too low top speed of others. Only 223 MpH for the CCGT and 214 for the Dallara : a bad surprise, because normaly these cars exceed 250 MpH ! And for the “OnLine Races", better is to forget. It's Stock-Car between furious insane, not of the Automobile race...\n\nUn jeu avec un travail visuel magnifique, que ce soit pour les voitures, les circuits, les villes ou les paysages, bien que le choix des Japonaises et Américaines soit excessif. Ici, ni Porsche, ni Ferrari, ni Lamborghini, etc. (Et les Audi, Zenvo, Jaguar, Volvo et autres AMG contre lesquelles on court en WSR, ne sont pas disponibles en DLC) Mais le principal reproche que je ferais à ce jeu, c'est qu'au lieu de s'appeller "Grid 2", il devrait s'appeller "Drift 2" tellement  TOUTES les voitures dérapent malgré des réglages medium. Certaines sont quasiment inconduisibles, comme la Ford Sierra 500, la Pagani Zonda Revolucion, la McLaren MP4-12C, la Honda NSX-R ou la Koenigsegg CCGT. Même la Dallara Indy avec ses pneus slicks, dérape ! Ce qui est un comble pour des Voitures de Course qui devraient rester sur des rails ! Mais à l'opposé, d'autres voitures sont totalement sous-vireuses comme les trois types de Nissan GTR, la Ford UTE ou la géniale Subaru Tomei Cusco Impreza. (Avec ces bagnoles, faites gaffe au choix de la taille de vos jantes !) Et ne parlons pas du freinage inexistant de presque toutes les voitures excepté de cette fabuleuse petite Subaru Impreza, du ridicule son-moteur de certaines, ou de la trop basse vitesse de pointe d'autres. Seulement 360 KmH pour la CCGT et 345 pour la Dallara : une mauvaise surprise, parce que normalement ces voitures dépassent les 400 KmH ! Quant aux "courses en Ligne", mieux vaut oublier.

However I was hoping for something closer to NFS Shift 2, a game that has the heart of a Sim racer with a bit more accessibility. The driving feels very drifty and exaggerated and is easier to manage with a gamepad controller then it is with a racing wheel. The biggest gripe I have is the omission on the cockpit view, it makes me just not want to play the game at all. My second biggest Gripe is the way DLC is handled. The game feels more like a F2P pay2win game where all the best parts are behind a pay wall. The base game comes with enough to get by but why do I need to pay more to race with my favorite car or on my favorite track.

The biggest disappointment here for most Codies fans will be the driving physics, which are laughable. When you realise drifing round a corner is faster than braking and clipping the apex, the game immediately loses any shine.\n\nIt looks good enough, but the huge amount of street courses versus the comparatively few road courses and the shonky driving model make for a pretty bland experience. Little bugs here and there once again dent the presentation, which - like DiRT - gets caught up in big name sponsors instead of focusing on the driving itself.\n\nA lack of a cockpit view is the final nail in the coffin for Grid 2.

BUT generaly it was BAD...\nFirstly and most annoying the opponent AI cars are like immortal. I mean come on! you crash on them with 270km, you get tossed like <3 <3 <3 <3 and they are just keep going like nothing happened AND NO DAMAGES? really?\nThe maps .. All the same, no matter what mode you play. 5-6 areas with a biiiiiiiit modified tracks.\nThe "freezing" because of enviromental lightning.. Doesn't matter how high or low you have your graphics. Doesn't matter if it's Intel or AMD. IT WILL FREEZE for a few miliseconds that will propably ruin your race especialy online.\nThe car handling. The whole thing was bad. where are those awesome ORIGINAL GRID settings for realistic driving? They don't even have the HEAD VIEW option.\n\nNow for the online mode.\nThis was the worst. The menus.. You have to click in damn LOT choices to just enter an event.. You need to exit a party to change car settings or get new unlocks or upgrade cars -means you will lose that party, take it's sweet time to find new-. The car menu was poorly designed.. To upgrade cars you kept needed to move up and down on riddiculus selections, to swich between cars you need to do all over menu browse from start.. ReALLY?\nSecond most stupid thing online.. CHEATERS .. yep just like dirt or f1 we have a lots of those here .. nothing more to say. And ofcourse that there is no penalty for those who are just playing to crash on you so their "pals" can get the flag. THIS IS NO <3<3<3ING DIRT!\n\nMy opinion, get GRID 1 if you want a really good racing game.. with a LOT of tracks and cars again, with NO need for stupid upgrates.. Just get money and buy cars..

No lie, you can seriously fly around a corner faster than any competition by just tapping the E-break, even in "grip" or "balanced" type cars. Its more of a challenge to race properly and grip the road, this is just silly...\n\nFor me GRID 2 is a bit of a let down since the first one, and also i grew up playing Codemaster's games like Colin McRae.

I could go on about the horrible americanised story, which is tedious and dull. I could do a rant on the 'Truefeel' handling system that robs the car's identity when driving and I could rage about the omission of the cockpit view, but these aren't the true reasons why, I just can't in good faith, give this game the recommended verdict.\n\nThe actual reasoning is it's DLC, which is FAR too overpriced. At £25 for all the DLC you get the following:\n- 5 Tracks (15 routes).\n- 24 Cars (2 liveries).\n- A 15% discount on every in-game purchase in online multiplayer.\n- Instant access to every online car.\n(This doesn't include the free demoliton derby game mode)\nThat may seem much, but as the game is £20, it's far less value, while creating a massive player disconnect in the multiplayer.\n\nOverall if you like GRID stay the hell away from this, and wait for GRID Autosport.

So, what can I say about it ? Is it possible to review GRID2 without mentionning GRID ?\nI don't think so.\nSo, let's kick it off with the new things. The things they added.\n- The LiveTrack. 100% unrealistic, painful if you like to know the tracks you are racing on, the LiveTrack is used for classic races or Endurance... Speaking of which:\n- Endurance mode. Basically, it's a fancy name to try and make you believe it's also brand new, when it's really just a race that ends at a specific time rather than a specific line.\n- Story. Let's face it, the first GRID was minimalist, story speaking. But it also didn't need it, and the lack of it - or the small presence of it - didn't bother me. This time, however, there is a scenario. This time, you are building the WSR, the World Series Racing. Some cinematics, some (fake) coverage by ESPN... It definitely feels more alive.\n\nNow, for the things they modified or deleted.\n- Cameras. No more interior camera - which is a shame, we'll admit it - and, more importantly, totally trashed up TV cameras - taking away all the value of the replays. No really, replaying your best drifts on GRID was like watching 2 Fast 2 Furious, in GRID2 it feels like the cameraman browses /r/trees on a daily basis.\n- Teammate. It was fun, knowing your fellow crew member was out there, helping you out on the track, pushing opponents out of the track, stealing the first place and apologizing deeply when he finished last. Now, all you have is the guy talking to you since day 1 (but you still don't know who it is) and complaining he'll have to mend your car when you wreck it.\n- The Drifting. It's hard to explain. But the drifting in GRID felt a hundred times better. Firstly, you were alone on the track, without stupid people pushing you out of the way because they forgot which race category they were in. Secondly, the vibe was astonishing - the japanse speakerman going crazy over your moves, the crowd... And lastly, it just felt more responsive. The combo system was nice and clear, the way the car drifted was purely arcade but so enjoyable...\n- No more rep/money system. GRID2 brings in the "fan system", already seen in Blur, for example.\n- Aaaaaand the way the sponsors work changed too. And this time, it clearly is below what GRID offered.\n\nThat's not all, these are just the things that pop out first when I think about it. Now, the graphics are really nice, there are plenty of cars to choose from, and the tracks are still interesting. So ?\n\n1) Stay away\n2) Only recommended when on sale\n3) Recommended\n4) Highly recommended\n5) This is a must play\n\nIt's probably still better to grab it while it's on sale - hint: it's really cheap - but if you like arcade racing, and/or the first GRID, well, go for it.","October 18, 2015","true","7.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Multiplayer is pretty inactive & the DLC is mostly stupid.\n\nLong version:\n\nI was a huge Grid 1 fan, and at first play this game disappointed me at how different it is.  Grid 1 wants you to turn corners carefully, 2 wants you to drift drift drift all the time.  It's very arcadey & far from the sim based racer 1 is.  Multiplayer servers aren't very active, I think people have moved on to Autosport & other games.  I really hate the corner cutting "feature", its punishment enough when you accidentally go over gravel or grass, I don't need an additional penalty for a mistake.\n\nThe maps get pretty old, even though they have you race on different sections of the same area.  The later parts of the game get really hard because the tier4 cars are nigh uncontrollable.  I had better times in the slower tier2 cars than I did the 200 mph+ tier4 cars because I crash at every turn in the tier3/4 cars.\n\nOne thing this game did well was a variety of gametypes.  As opposed to just race, drift & head to head from 1, it added checkpoint, overtake, time attack & togue.\n\nAs a comparison to Grid 1, it's very inferior.  As a cheap racing game, it's fun enough.\n\nOverall verdict: 7.2/10","December 28, 2014","true","26.2"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

CPU can cruise the tight corners easily.\n- NO RACING LINE\n- Inconsistent difficulty\n- Grip cars feel useless\n\n\nRace Driver Grid was a fantastic game, but in terms of driving it felt quite similar to the Need for Speed series. It feels more arcadey than realistic. Grid 2 on the other hand did a better job of making the game feel real. You can't just hit the pedal and force your car to turn. You have to find the right moment to brake and accelerate. The game feels much better in terms of circuit racing or sprints. You actually have to fight all the way to get to the number 1 spot. In Grid 1 it was quite easy to get to 1st.\n\nThere are lots of cars as well, and they are classified as one of the three : Balanced, Drift or Grip. In my entire playtime I don't think I have ever used a Grip car for a race, unless I had no choice and the game forced me to use it. You're going to have to drift a lot in Grid 2, and some grip cars suck at drifting.\n\nSpeaking of drifting, it sucks in this game. Grid 1 absolutely nailed drifting. It was perfect. Now drifting here is a 30 second track and no customizations. Plain horrible. It tried to go Japanese since most drift races are on mountain passes.\n\nThe game still has no racing line, which can become crucial in those difficult tracks for the Vehicle Challenges on the higher tiers. There were 3 difficult challenges where the racing line would have helped significantly. The Jaguar at Hong Kong, the Benz at Okutama and the Pagani Huayra challenge. Cars also become unstable at high speeds while other cars can just stick to the ground and not slide. I've seen this several times already. I forcefully rammed a CPU car and took a 10 second lead, but he was able to catch up and beat me on the last corner. I've seen his style and even with the car he should not be able to just accelerate through corners at that speed. Don't be surprised if you see the CPUs blast through chicanes at 250km/hr without slowing down.\n\nIt's a good game, but I can't recommended it. A lot of race types just suck and the circuit races and sprints are the only fun ones.","December 30, 2014","false","24.7"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

If you want a realistic racing game, you should not buy GRID 2. I was very disappointed... I preordered it for 35,99€ and I have to say it was a waste of money. Because of that preordering I received a free copy of GRID 1, which was a big reason for me buying the game, because I really liked the car physics and graphics of GRID 1 at that time. Do not get me wrong, I still think GRID 1 is an excellent racing game! Actually it is the best I have ever played. I just can't understand what codemasters tried to do with GRID 2, I just don't get it...\n\nI played the first part of GRID and GRID 2 is a totally different game. GRID 1 had a cockpit view, which does NOT exist in GRID 2! For me personally the cockpit view is one of the most important things to make a racing game realistic. The developers said they invested much time in making the cars behave realistic on the asphalt. They failed miserably... Every car feels the same. There is no real difference. Drifting is totally unrealistic. If you want to drift you just have to fastly turn the wheel to one side, then turn it back to the other side and you are drifting. Normally when you're drifting in a realistic racing game or in reality itself you should lose time, but not in GRID 2. It feels like you always have to drift to maintain your speed. So many good game modes (drift-challenge, touge, profi-touge etc.) from GRID 1 are just left out completely in GRID 2. They tried to put a story into the game, which is actually a good idea. You have to show your skills in different racing leagues all over the world to get their appreciation and win them for the WRC (World Series Racing), a league where the best drivers of the world meet each other on the racetrack. The idea is great, but the implementation didn't succeed... It's always the same: Win in leagues, unlock new leagues, win against those leagues, win the WRC, win in new leagues, unlock, WRC...\n\nIf you want to play a realistic racing game with great game modes and a cockpit view, buy GRID 1 instead of GRID 2.\nIf you already played GRID 1 and think about buying GRID 2, because you liked the gameplay, do NOT do that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieFi5hykins/recommended/44350/","CharlieFi5hykins","=_Charlie Fi5hykins_=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CharlieFi5hykins/","81 products in account","I have recently bought GRID autosport, which probably means that i am not going to be playing GRID 2 very regularly as i have migrated to playing autosport, so i decided that i would write a review, seeing as i was rather close to 100 hours so i think i know what im talking about, or atleast mostly.\n\nGRID 2 is an amazing game, probably the best racing game that i am yet to play, other than the new release of GRID which is infact GRID autosport. There are so many features and aspects that i like about GRID 2, but im not going to list them all as i would be going on forever, so im going to keep them blunt, short but informative at the same time.\n\nThings i liked about the game:\n--------------------------------\n\nThe controls: The controls took me a matter of minutes to get use to, and from there i was able to drive nice and smoothly, without having to worry about pressing the wrong button on my remote. (I believe you can also use a steering wheel for this game).\n\nThe detail/graphics: The maps, the cars, the road, even the cones. you name it. Everything looks brilliant. The reflections on the cars are brilliant, and this detail is consistent throughout the whole game, and the graphics that they have produced, can even run on my computer which i am suprised about. The game is not slow or laggy whatsoever, meaning that you can have a very smooth racing experience, but at the same time have a lovely eyesite of distant mountains, as you control your car.\n\nMusic: The game has a variety of different tracks that are played throughout the game. The loading music, the main menu music, the racing music, all of it is of a high standard, and is great to listen to, and really makes you feel like your driving a car.\n\nAI: The AI of this game are great. The WSR campaign, which is pretty much a singleplayer mode, is absolutely realistic, due to the fact that the computer drivers have been programmed so good. When driving, the way that the drivers move and think are so lifelike, and occasionally challenge you if you do in-fact smash into the back of there car, but i wouldn't try it.\n\nHandling: All of the cars are tuned to perfection, and getting use to each type of handling, which each of the cars uniquely have is done with ease.\n\nMultiplayer: Although the multiplayer is on the verge of becoming dead, its still great fun when playing with a full lobby, and the feeling of taking another persons car out after them doing it before hand is beautiful. (Not that thats how you should drive.)\n\nBad points about the game:\n-----------------------------\n\nWhat are you talking about? There are no bad points about this game! Despite all the people that have played GRID 2 and complained about it, i think that they should simply realise that codemasters took their time making this, as it is truly a masterpiece, and an experience that i am never going to forget. The game is absolutely brillaint, and upon buying GRID autosport which was released shortly after im reviewing this, i cannot wait to carry on with the next game in the series. Thank you so much codemasters for bringing us this game, and i would like to thank you for also releasing Autosport, as so far it is brilliant. Thank you, and i hope that this review has influenced anyone that is planning on buying the game.","August 9, 2014","true","120.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

If you want a realistic racing game, you should not buy GRID 2. I was very disappointed... I preordered it for 35,99€ and I have to say it was a waste of money. Because of that preordering I received a free copy of GRID 1, which was a big reason for me buying the game, because I really liked the car physics and graphics of GRID 1 at that time. Do not get me wrong, I still think GRID 1 is an excellent racing game! Actually it is the best I have ever played. I just can't understand what codemasters tried to do with GRID 2, I just don't get it...\n\nI played the first part of GRID and GRID 2 is a totally different game. GRID 1 had a cockpit view, which does NOT exist in GRID 2! For me personally the cockpit view is one of the most important things to make a racing game realistic. The developers said they invested much time in making the cars behave realistic on the asphalt. They failed miserably... Every car feels the same. There is no real difference. Drifting is totally unrealistic. If you want to drift you just have to fastly turn the wheel to one side, then turn it back to the other side and you are drifting. Normally when you're drifting in a realistic racing game or in reality itself you should lose time, but not in GRID 2. It feels like you always have to drift to maintain your speed. So many good game modes (drift-challenge, touge, profi-touge etc.) from GRID 1 are just left out completely in GRID 2. They tried to put a story into the game, which is actually a good idea. You have to show your skills in different racing leagues all over the world to get their appreciation and win them for the WRC (World Series Racing), a league where the best drivers of the world meet each other on the racetrack. The idea is great, but the implementation didn't succeed... It's always the same: Win in leagues, unlock new leagues, win against those leagues, win the WRC, win in new leagues, unlock, WRC...\n\nIf you want to play a realistic racing game with great game modes and a cockpit view, buy GRID 1 instead of GRID 2.\nIf you already played GRID 1 and think about buying GRID 2, because you liked the gameplay, do NOT do that. You will only be very disappointed. It has nothing to do with the previous version of GRID.","February 26, 2014","false","8.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The system is flawed, other players can push you off track, you receive the penalty and you did nothing wrong. Oversteer or understeer on the cars can also cause you to go off track, you get penalty, your race is ruined. Others players use you car as their brake, pushing you off the track, you get the penalty\n3: Grid, the grid is flawed, if you get pole, you're in with a chance of winning, unless your car isnt as fast as the others then you're not in with a chance. if you're at the back or in the middle, it is highly likely you car will be smashed up into the first few corners by the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bags who cant drive.\n\nOther than thosethings and a few others like the various dlc, then it's a good game.

Any car can drift, even Grippy-type ones, with some handbrake persuasion. About the only thing that's improved instead of replaced is the damage modelling. Frankly, Codemasters should've renamed the game if the only thing keeping it in touch with the original GRID is the premise of tackling multiple motorsport disciplines, from straight up races to touges.\n\nVisually, there's no denying it; GRID 2 looks beautiful, and for once I accept the large amounts of lens flare and lens grime, only because there is no true Dashboard Camera. This game really doesn't need it anyway.\n\nSound design is also amazingly well done. It's quite rare to see a racing game do the Skyline R34 engine and exhaust sounds as close to the real thing as it gets, and then there's the tunnels and terrain echoing.\n\nCareer mode offers varied racing disciplines, and the multiplayer is very solid, but it all depends on your ability to look past the changed features, little content and LACK OF COCKPIT VIEW *grrrr* for an otherwise pure racing experience.","May 9, 2014","true","44.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Good arcade racing - I've spent many, many hours in this game, primarily in the multiplayer section. While it can be frustrating at times with the amount of accidents people seem to get into, I've also had a great number of tremendously fun and close races\n2. Seeminly endless supply of new blood - lots of people are at or near the MP level cap (level 99), but there are usually a good number of lower levels floating about. While that mixture of levels and experience does segregate the field a bit on track (which is kind of a con really), it also evens out the gradient a bit. Also gives great opportunity for lower levels to learn which cars suit which tracks and how to corner effectively (NOT THAT THEY SEEM TO NOTICE!)\n\nCON:\n1. Very poor DLC integration - things like the Spa pack provide content that only very rarely can be used. Not many people choose to host the extra tracks in custom events, and even if they do there are often problems in joining sessions. If you don't EXACTLY match the number of DLC packs they have, you can't join their game.\nFor single-player only guys, this isn't an issue as you can use the content at your whim, but it's been the multiplayer that kept this game going for me\n2. Poor car balance - there are clear favourite cars in each of the four tiers. You can beat them in "lesser" cars, but only if you absolutely nail every single braking point and apex of every single metre of track. Cars which are already powerful get a great number of upgrade slots, while poor cars only have space for a handful, which don't even make a difference.\n","December 28, 2013","true","645.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

It lacks the cockpit view and is a blend of NFS underground, Dirt 2, and Grid. The Dirt 2 factor is an annoying announcer and goofy menus. Where this game shines is that it smacks down every NFS title on this platform. It lacks upgrades to vehicles but that can be forgiven due to the great exhaust sounds and eye candy. If you want longer races and better handling go pick up Grid. If you want some quicker racing and some drifting this is a great game. You may even prefer the handling it's just more arcadish and you can smack your car around a bit more. The DLC is mostly just more cars and this is where your upgrades were hidden. Oh you wanted to upgrade your ride like on NFS underground well that will be $4.99. It's still a bit pricey even when bundled together but it compliments a solid title.","November 27, 2015","true","9.4"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Back then I couldn't tell the difference between a pickup truck and a Lamborghini (I'm exaggerating, but when it came to cars, I really did lack knowledge). I didn't have any interest of cars back then, just like every other kid, I liked Grand Theft Auto and Minecraft. Yeah that's right, I'm not afraid to tell the world that I used to like it! But after I bought that game, that one little racing game with over 800 cars, it changed my life, my perspective on how I saw the world around me. In no time, I became a car enthusiast, and switched to PC gaming. But I lost my Gran Turismo... and for 3 years I've never had a legitimate racing game. But then I bought this game. It took me a whole week to decide on buying this game. I had to break everything down, such as seeing the requirements, reading online reviews, and looking at gameplays. At first I thought to myself, "I should probably save this game for an H1Z1 sale." But then I thought back to Gran Tursimo days. After that, there was no stopping me from buying it. And then, after 2 hours of waiting for 6 GB to go through, while watching episodes of How I Met Your Mother... I launched it. I clicked on career mode and then I started my first race with the Ford Mustang Match 1. It was an amazing race and brought back so many memories of 11 year old me... Plus I had all the DLC for the game and had a lot of fun. Everything about this game is amazing! The graphics, the physics, the handling of the cars, it's all just so realistic! Despite the fact that this game only has a limited amount of cars everything else is amazing! And it has split-screen mode so if you want to challenge your friend to a race, you can! If you are a car enthusiast, I encourage you to get this game!","October 25, 2015","true","2.9"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","9","16","2","3"

Difficulty once again dictates how many Flashbacks you have at your disposal, with normal giving you a generous five. We still managed to regularly use these all up though.\n\nNot only has Flashback been refined, but the entire game has been stripped down to brass tacks. Sadly that means you're no longer free to surf eBay for bargain cars, and in fact shopping for rides has been dispensed with entirely. Now you're simply granted cars for completing races, presented with a choice of two very similar models from different manufacturers at certain junctures. You can then win the second car through completing a vehicle challenge in which you have to beat the target time in a hot lap.\n\nMultiplayer features all of the various racing modes from career, including Checkpoint, Touge, Drift, Elimination, Race, Overtake and so on, and spreads them across the single-player online Global Challenges - that can be completed at your leisure each week - and the more traditional competitive multiplayer aspect. This all has a persistent levelling system, with levelling up granting access to newer and better cars, while any cash you gain can be used to purchase upgrades for your rides.\n\nGRID 2 is a more than worthy. Yes, the lack of a cockpit view is somewhat disappointing, but when the handling and controls are so tight and enjoyable, it's hard to complain. Add to that some blistering visuals with truly stunning lighting, and you have one of this current generation's finest racing titles. Not just that, but GRID 2 might just be the last truly great racing game of this generation.","June 9, 2013","true","18.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Although some flaws might draw you away from this game, I would probably still suggest it. HOWEVER: The Reloaded Edition is a true waste of money; half the cars just performance versions of the previous ones, and in multiplayer, (if you can find a game) DLC is almost always disabled. Also, IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER EXPERIENCE, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!\n\nPROS:\n- Physics (while at times completely unrealistic) make this game for me. They're probably the most fun/realistic of many racing games I've played\n- Singleplayer mode is quite extensive and fun, and it lets you use most cars in the game pretty regularly\n- Customization might not be the best, and it has a serious flaw (as shown in cons), but it is very expansive for personalizing a car to your liking\n- This game adapts to your driving style very well, for example: If you prefer drifting, you know you can overtake/attack opponents at corners very effectively, while using a more powerful car with more traction lets you overtake others on straights\n\nCONS:\n- Customization has a very annoying flaw: You cannot use the default liveries of your cars unless you're in multiplayer; in singleplayer the default livery is automatically applied to all vehicles without any confirmation from the player ... This actually ruins customization for me, especially being an owner of the Reloaded Edition and not being able to use the DLC liveries (but meh, the Reloaded Edition was under $30 on ♥♥♥)\n- The AI in this game is the worst I've seen in any game for years; AI using drift cars act exactly as others using grip cars; each AI has no personality of its own ... In addition, the AI units don't have any apparent awareness of your positon; they commit to their actions regardless of where you are, commonly resulting in them pitting you, ramming you into the side of the wall, or braking before necessary, causing you to crash into them (it is quite obvious that this is not meant to be a feature excused by "aggressive drivers")\n- The multiplayer is indeed the worst I've seen of any game; not only are there very rarely players on, and if you manage to find some, DLC is always disabled, and overall its design is terrible: flashbacks (if enabled) have clearly had 5 minutes spent in their design, the AI is even worse (driving absurdly slowly, having even less awareness of you, etc.), players are able to ram you out of the way without any effect to their progress, etc ... AGAIN: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IF YOU WANT A DECENT MULTIPLAYER GAME!\n\nDespite all these flaws, I would still suggest this game for its pros; it is still a fun game and decent racing game.","July 25, 2014","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Grid 2 brings good graphics and details with a lot of sound especially when you're going around the race track.\n\nHowever this game is not as good as Grid 1 as you get the cars during the game, so it's pretty much straight forward for when you're playing on single player. It would of been great to have the visual of what part of your vehicle is broken instead of some audio saying "Your left wheel is damaged, expect some pull when you turn."\n\nThe game would have been good if it carried on with the cars mileages and the price of them as this made you think more on saving on your budget.\n\nI’ve tried multiplayer once and didn’t really enjoy it as it’s just the same concept as single player but you just play with other people and gain levels. I can’t really say much about it as I’ve only played one game and didn’t enjoy it much.\n\nThe game is good overall but it could have been much better if they didn’t change it all!\n","March 20, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moving_McTarget/recommended/44350/","Moving_McTarget","Moving McTarget","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moving_McTarget/","609 products in account","When I was looking at some information on this game, I found a quote from Codemasters in relation to the length of time it would take to complete Grid 2. This game is supposed to take more than 30 hours to complete.\n\n“We’ve noticed a trend in recent years with some of the supposedly ‘big’ games that were actually six hours long, and we didn’t feel that was sufficient value for money for our fans at all. We wanted to make sure there was so much more for them to do.”\n\nNormally I would complete a game prior to reviewing it, but in this instance I could not bring myself to do it. I will start with the cons first as this will give me some time to think of something good that this game has to offer.\n\nCons:\nRealism in this game has gone out the window. Codemasters pride themselves in the amount of effort they spend on realism in their F1 series. Unfortunately this is the only series that has remained true to its original. The original grid game was a lot of fun and on both the Xbox and PC version I have spent untold hours playing (mainly drifting) and hat a lot of fun. This game just doesn’t have the same appeal. Even The Colin McRae series died along with Colin Dirt 1 was the last of the series that was any good. Dirt 2 was supposed to be a homage to Colin McRae, but it was appalling.\n\nDrifting: DRIFTS ARE NOT POPPING THE HANDBRAKE AND DOING A LITTLE SLIDE ROUND THE CORNER. Grid was so much fun when it came to the drift challenges. There was nothing more satisfying than pulling off a linked chain of drifts for an entire lap and then watching the replay for that satisfaction. All you do in this game is pull the handbrake (or E-Brake) coming in to a corner, do a little slide, drive up to the next corner and repeat. You cannot keep drifts going in this game.

This game is supposed to take more than 30 hours to complete.\n\n“We’ve noticed a trend in recent years with some of the supposedly ‘big’ games that were actually six hours long, and we didn’t feel that was sufficient value for money for our fans at all. We wanted to make sure there was so much more for them to do.”\n\nNormally I would complete a game prior to reviewing it, but in this instance I could not bring myself to do it. I will start with the cons first as this will give me some time to think of something good that this game has to offer.\n\nCons:\nRealism in this game has gone out the window. Codemasters pride themselves in the amount of effort they spend on realism in their F1 series. Unfortunately this is the only series that has remained true to its original. The original grid game was a lot of fun and on both the Xbox and PC version I have spent untold hours playing (mainly drifting) and hat a lot of fun. This game just doesn’t have the same appeal. Even The Colin McRae series died along with Colin Dirt 1 was the last of the series that was any good. Dirt 2 was supposed to be a homage to Colin McRae, but it was appalling.\n\nDrifting: DRIFTS ARE NOT POPPING THE HANDBRAKE AND DOING A LITTLE SLIDE ROUND THE CORNER. Grid was so much fun when it came to the drift challenges. There was nothing more satisfying than pulling off a linked chain of drifts for an entire lap and then watching the replay for that satisfaction. All you do in this game is pull the handbrake (or E-Brake) coming in to a corner, do a little slide, drive up to the next corner and repeat. You cannot keep drifts going in this game. For those of you that are looking at buying this game to relive those font memories of drifting around an entire track but with revised graphics, don’t bother. Just like me, you will be sorely disappointed.\n\nYour friendly AI team coordinator that is in your ear every race: Even if your mechanical knowledge is strictly limited to knowing where the fuel goes in to your car, you will find the commentators remarks cringe worthy.

After six hours of playing, I can say that every new race just adds frustration and disappointment.\nThe AI is a nightmare Sunday afternoon. Whenever a corner comes along, they all slam on their brakes in syncronization and take it at a driving-school safe speed. When not on a corner, they form a massive rolling roadblock between you and the "chosen one;" the AI who started in first. Except in very rare cases, the AI do not trade positions.\nIf you are tired of the AI, you can try a gate-to-gate race, where every time you pass a truck you get points, every truck you pass increases the points given by the next truck, and losing paint resets the combo. However, you will soon find that the truck drivers are the same AI drivers, except after having been out partying and drinking all night. They have no ability to maintain their lane and seem determined to slam into you as you try to pass.\nThere are three types of cars. Drift, Grip, and Balanced. To me, drift seems to be like trying to drive a greased whale on ice, grip is the absolute reverse (whatever that may be. A rough shark in sand?), and balanced is so far in the middle that it is incapable of either drifting or gripping. Probably with more practice I could make any of the cars perform, but I simply don't care to.\n\nIn summary, I would suggest downloading the demo and just playing that. It's free and has most of the experience of the full game.","February 21, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

BUT !! There are some issues..\n1) Where on Earth going side by side with another car makes you unable to turn your car AWAY from the other car ??? Soooo annoying...\n2) The Arcade style is a bit too much I would say, definetley too much disadvantage of not having a wheel, cuz the buttons sometimes cause funny and unrealistic accidents, and then you'll have to use a FLASHBACK, which is the dumbest thing in a car game... Learn to drive..\n3) AI is often stupid, and on higher Tiers they don't stand a chance, but you always have to fight through them, zig-zagging all the time.. which is fine...\n4) Multi... The cars are way too unpredictable and sensitive, so even if you don't want to cause any trouble for the other players, there will always be lots of accidents, not to mention the intentional T-bones and FishTails...\n\nOn the Contrary, the game feels just about right, and with practicing a track a few times you can constantly set your lap records, the cars are awesome, the maps offer a wide variety, you can find which suits you.\n\nBtw DLC cars are pretty damn powerful...","March 29, 2014","true","75.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You can hear what other cars are doing around you even if you don't see them. The sound track tho, the first thing i did was to go in the menu and turn it off, haven't turned it on since i started it the first time.\n\nHandling:\nThe handling isn't great, the car tends to drift way to much and when drifting have super tires that can grip anything, but if you see it from an arcade point of view it's not to bad, there is worse but there are worse. I do find the handling of the destruction derby cars to be better then the other cars, they actually feel heavy.\n\nMultiplayer:\nHere is where GRID 2 shines, many different game modes, from racing, drifting to destruction derby. And it's easy to create a lobby and start a game and you can create a mini league with up to 5 races which is super nice.\n\nCockpit view:\nThis is a hot one, when i first heard it i disregarded the game totally, but when i got i and started driving, it isn't something i really miss, sure i use it when playing Assetto Corsa and GTR2, but they are a completely different genre. The hood view is in my opinion just as good or even better in this type of game.\n\nDLC:\nI don't have any numbers here, but it feels like half the cars are DLC packs, which is totally rubbish, there are 11 pay DLC packs on steam 11!! That's like 10 to much. If i buy a game i want all the content. Soon Codemaster will starting to slice up the F1 games, knock on wood...\n\nTracks/Cars:\nAs said above there aren't many cars unfortunately, you've got your standard European BMW, American Muscle, some JDM, but it's not much. And for tracks i was disappointed, i usually like proper race tracks, but there are so few (without DLC) that the only tracks i tend to race are the A to B tracks.\n\nOverall:\nIf you look at it for what it is and not for what it's predecessor was, it's a very fun game to play with your mates, get a lobby full of 12 people and just race. If you don't mind the drift handling it has and the lack of cars and tracks and like me find it for a fiver, it's definitely worth it.\n\nAnd for you hardcore GRID1 fans wait to see what Grid Autosport may have to offer.","April 24, 2014","true","28.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I get that. It happens with old age. We fall down. We drop things. We lose our dentures. I want to die sleeping peacefully, not like the other screaming passengers in my car. But if I'm awake, there's one thing I can still do well and that's drive.\n\nIf real cars had physics like this, no one would be able to stay on the road and I've raced vehicles before. These ice skates with axles handle horribly. They don't turn or brake worth a darn. Tapping on the brakes will send the car suddenly careening off 90 degrees in some random direction. It would be easier to drive a pinball than these tings. I've tried this game from hard to very easy and the handling isn't much different. Cars just can't stay on the road. Bumping another car - even if you hit their back quarter panel on a turn - will send your car careening off wildly while their car isn't impacted at all. I guess Newton's Second Law does not exist in the GRID2 universe.\n\nThe most important things about any racing game are the driving and physics. GRID2 seems to have forgotten both. Perhaps it is different with a wheel, but with a gamepad I find it unplayable. It smacks of a poor console port and you can do better for your money.

Love the handling - reminds me of PGR.\nRuns really smooth with my HD 7870. I'd go as far as to claim that this is the best looking Racing Game available at this moment - since Need for Speed Rivals has been crippled to 30fps and Forza 5 has been downgraded to accomodate to the Xbox One's lacklustre performance ;P\n\nMy only gripe with GRID 2 so far is its businessmodel and pricing - there should have been no pre-order incentives to begin with - since there is no shortage of supply or shipping cost when it comes to digital distribution. I shouldn't be paying more just because I choose to buy the game during the week of its release rather than paying ahead of release... I simply like to be able to access the stuff I buy immediately once I put my money on the table. In addition I'm not a big fan of microtransactions only devalue the initial purchase and make people hold out for Sales and Collectors Editions... which I did. Aside from being rather pervasively integrated into this game - most of the car-pacs seem to be variations on the cars you can unlock in the game - thus don't seem to affect the balance of the game.\nThe one DLC that does offer something interesting (Destruction Derby) comes at no additional cost.\nIt appears that some Tier 3 cars which you should be able to win in career mode are locked away behind some nasty difficultiy spike - but thankfully you are able to switch difficultiy in the options at any time during your career which negates the frustration.\n\nI'm having a blast with this game so far - the WSR is a brilliant idea and provides a lot of diversity and motivation. There's a distinct Street Race Action-Movie feel to the game and its events which make it very cohesive - though its gritty Sepia tone and Hollywood Soundtrack may not be for everyone... but this is more down to personal preference and subjecitve perception. The Car demolition and aggressive AI work really well and add an additional layer to the challenge.\n\nI'm not missing the Cockpit View all that much, since I don't use it for racing - In other games I mostly use it  to check out the interiors - it kinda adds to the feel of driving a real car. Maybe with the arrival of Occulus Rift the Cockpit View will become relevant once again?\n\nAll in all I can recommend this game to anyone looking for a challenging Racing Game.\n\n9/10: Top of its Genre","November 29, 2013","true","46.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

It's somewhere near arcade, but it's not. It's like... somewhere between them and it's awful.\nIn this game, you go through corners faster with drifting than braking and following the racing lines. It's ok for arcade style, but then it tries to be like simulation, tiny error will ♥♥♥♥ you up and make you lose places or even crash your car (that's why there is rewind feature?). This control will make you very frustrated when you go deeper in the career mode (when your cars are faster and facing harder components).\n\nMay be you can do better after practicing more with this game. But when you played another racing games, no matter it's simulation type like F1 2013 or arcade type like NFS, you will find it hard to adapt to this controls. It's very unique that no racing game is similar to this.\n\nThis game shows potential but it's totally ruined by its car physics.","January 22, 2014","false","15.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","4"

THis must be the worst excuse of a sequel I have seen in years. Technically solid with nice graphics and a lot of feel for the car, albeit very simcade-ish. But that is as far as the good goes. The bad: No real gameplay ala GRID. It's more of strung together orgy of races like Dirt or similar. No more raceteam of your own, no more spnsors to win, no more money to earn to buy cars etc etc. Grid 2 is a sub-par game. It is actually an insult to call this Grid at all. It has nothing in common with the original. Codemasters(yea I know the nameis a joke) proves yet again (after the F1 series) how able they are in dumbing down a formerly good concept and ruin the fun.

Nevertheless I'd reccomend this game IF it is on sale. For the $10 I spent on it I think it was completely worth the money, however I cannot see myself forking over $30 for it. The game is very well put together, I especially like that you actually have to use the brakes unlike in Forza Horizon, however it loses some points from me on the car selection. There are some cars I really would have liked to see in this game that I have not seen yet, such as the Audi R8 and the Lamborghini Gallardo. That being said I did not finish the main game yet, I just started the final season. Another small hit the game will take from me is the test drive because there is only one track you can drive on, it is not a major issue but I would have liked to have seen one or two more tracks. The last thing negative about the game is not the makers fault. The online community seems to be dead, everytime I try to play an online race I wait for a while before the game tells me it could not find any online races. Despite the few drawbacks the game is very fun and recommended.","November 18, 2014","true","22.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While this structure makes sense in the context of the narrative it has the unfortunate side effect of wearing out each location's welcome. Each region has three or four primary race location with varying routes through each. While the tracks themselves are technically different they share sections and landmarks from tracks that you previously raced in. Spreading a dozen races across three locations where you encounter some of the same sections across various routes does not leave the impression that variety is this game's strong suit despite a track list that would indicate otherwise. Grid 2's greatest innovation is it's LiveRoute system. Basically track designs are modular and with LiveRoutes these sections of track are loaded on the fly completely randomizing the track and forcing players to react to each change since the mini map is unavailable. Each section of track comes together seamlessly without creating any awkward or impossible turns though some sections of track can be repeated several time throughout an event which really detracts from the novelty of the feature.\n\nVehicles embody the characteristics of their real world counterparts but sliding and drifting are much easier and emphasized but Grid 2 is devoid of the turbo boosts and jumps that characterize pure arcade racers. Ultimately it's a system that is extremely enjoyable. Muscle cars roar and and corner like hippos sprinting around a KY jelly covered skating rink. Tuners slide around like asthmatic mosquitoes as their turbos hiss and wheeze while track cars warp across the asphalt and slice through corners like razors through the wrists of a My Chemical Romance fan. Unfortunately the car count is on the small side, encompassing less than fifty of the most elite performance vehicles from the past and present. Well I should say the most elite races not to wear Porsche, Ferrari or Lamborghini badges. Customization is also limited to changing wheels and adding garish liveries to your machines. Copious sponsor stickers also spoil your vehicle's aesthetics while offering an opportunity to complete objectives that earn WSR more fans.\n\nTogue events, Checkpoint races, Overtake events, Endurance races, Drift events, elimination races, and head to head races round out the event types. These events do an admirable job of keeping the main campaign from becoming stale. Likewise strong AI ensures that you have to work a bit for victories. You opponents can be really aggressive and full damage means that trying to play bumper cars in the corners can end your race or severely hamper your car's performance. Ricocheting off of your opponents in the first turn and holding the lead isn't as viable a strategy in Grid as it is other racing games.\n\nCar models are appropriately detailed though they lack cockpit views. Matte, gloss, metallic and pearlescent paint are convincingly rendered and the damage models are unrivaled. Hoods, bumpers, fenders, spoilers and trunk lids can be smashed off and tires can even rupture. Geometry wrinkles and deforms after impacts in a rather convincing manner. As great as all of this is what really stands out are the tracks... Sparks from overhead subway rails shower the streets of Chicago and papers blow over the roadway, mists hover over the pavement in California as leaves blow around. Dubai's glorious skyscrapers and yachts dot the landscape. In short the tracks seem alive... It's a nice departure from the often drab and dead cityscapes that many games have you race through. The sound is also solid. Races are mostly scored with a symphony of pistons pumping like drums, turbos whistling like woodwinds and tires squealing like the string section. Exhausts howl, echoing off of mountain sides and tunnels and the echoing of your opponent’s vehicle seconds off of your lead can be intense.","November 25, 2013","true","26.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","0"

I was severely disappointed. The graphics are what you'd expect from a game this new, but the driving physics are definitely a step further towards the arcade side, even compared to Grid 1. You can't turn the wheel more than 15 degrees off-center without the back end breaking loose, and don't even think about trail-braking into a corner. If you should have the misfortune to hit something, you're greeted with an insufferable camera angle and some visual effect that make it annoying to try and recover the car.\n\nAdditionally, customization options for driver aids and controller settings are nonexistant.

I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I think anyone who likes the Codemasters or NFS series this should be a no brainer.\n\nPROS -\n- Huge variety in cars, tracks and race types\n- Graphics\n- Damage modelling\n- Paint job customization\n- Driving model\n- Rewind feature\n\nCONS -\n- No race line feature\n- Car spins during painting\n- Driving model\n\nIf you noticed that I put the driving model as both a pro and a con, it's because really the model is subjective. It is not a 'hardcore' model like you will find in other high end racers. Nor is it too arcady. Like I said, if you enjoy NFS etc, this fits in well with those.\n\nThe rewind feature is a huge step forward to reduce frustration in racing games. Ever run the perfect race only to make a small error at the last lap and get dumped to the end of the pack? That's over. Have a crash or take a corner wrong and spin out? Just rewind a few seconds and have another go at it. Feel that's cheating? Don't use it. Personally, I love the option.\n\nCars look great, tracks look great. Track your best times and stats against your Steam friends. I haven't used the multiplayer much, but its there if that's your thing.\n\nGet bored of racing? Try the demolition derby!

The focus is purely on racing and the lack of upgrades means that you get really tense and challenging races.\nGraphics are superb and if you have a decent card the game is spectacular in eyefinity and isn't too demanding so you don't need SLI.\n\nI pre-ordered when it first came available on steam. There were a few things that I hated about the meta-game (career sp), for example, the animation that counts your fans after each race was un-skippable. I gave codemasters feedback about aspects that could be improved and they were implemented soon after in a patch!

Codemasters continue their pattern of dumbing down their racing games in GRID 2.\n\nIf you want an arcade racing game with voiceovers telling you how awesome you are when you win races, a ridiculous storyline and ads being pushed in your face, then this might be the game for you.\n\nThe storyline removes almost any choice you have in how you play the game. There's no element of building your garage or team, as you're essentially a hired driver.\n\nIn terms of driving, before release the developers boasted about removing assists, such as traction control. This isn't true, strictly speaking. What you have instead, is traction control that's permanently on - perhaps at a slightly lower level than in GRID. This totally undermines the drifting minigame (which was quite good in GRID), which is now "pull handbrake on corner, and wait for car to auto-correct", essentially.\n\nCertain cars will have the rear step out given the right conditions, but broadly speaking all the cars handle the same. There is a fairly wide selection of cars, but when they're all the same and you have around 20 cars to pick from for a race, there's no point in picking any of them, except the fastest one.\nAdditionally, there are no interior views on the cars, like in GRID.\n\nThe game looks great though. The cars and scenery are well modeled, and there's a very nice lighting system. Some of the new tracks, are also quite nice.\nOverall however, this is an outright worse game than GRID.\n\nIf you like arcade racing, the original GRID is still quite a good game, flaws and all.\nIf you're looking for a simulator, this certainly isn't the game for you.","December 31, 2013","false","6.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really, really want it to be good, but so far it's been frustrating to no end. The driving physics seem like they could be decent, but all the cars you get in the start are "Drift" class, where drift apparently means "Absolutely no road friction." It's seriously impossible to keep them from sliding. Now, this is bad enoungh on its own, but the A.I. is pretty much completely oblivious to your presence on the track with them, and has no qualms about ramming into you at any speed or position. Not only that, but they don't slide like you do. Ever. So instead of a crash where everyone is screwed up, they drive happily on by while you go careening off into a wall, left at the utter back of the pack. I thought we'd mastered A.I. that tries to avoid collisions in racing games, someone should really let Codemasters know. I should also note that I play with a racing wheel, so I should have the sort of fine control to avoid these things (and can in other games) but apparently that's meaningless here. I don't often ragequit games of any type, but when I do, apparently the game is GRID 2.\n\nTL:DR version:\nGood:\n-Game looks and runs great\n-Slick menus and dialog like most other Codemasters racing titles\n-Wheel support is great, you can feel the weight of the car and the road easily\n-Decent career mode\n\nBad\n-Game forces you into crappy cars with no grip\n-A.I. isn't subject to the same forces as you (they have seemingly infinite traction)\n-A.I. doesn't avoid collisions in the slightest, will run you off the road and laugh\n-No cockpit view (Seriously? Why?)\n\nI really, really hope I can at least get some cars with traction later into the game, but for them to force you to drive like a madman and then punish you for driving like a madman at the start of the game is stupid. Then again, Codemasters did decide that making an entire game out of the terrible Gymkhana events from DiRT 3 was a good idea... I guess they're going downhill.","January 2, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's easier and it feels easier (but not that easy) but, on the other hand, it's not so frustrating so it makes it a fun game to play both offline and online. I'd say it is not as serious as the original GRID was. It's a more casual experience that in my opinion isn't neither better, or worse. As stated before, just different with the same amount of quality. Graphics are nice aswell.

The stuff I was hesistant about were nullified. The DLC isn't nescecarry since the base game gives you enough cars/tracks to enjoy yourself and with the sale the DLC weren't that pricey. No cockpit-view is a setback from the original, however I never really used it... There is still the bonnet view and for me that suffices, al though I can understand that the people who did play in cockpit-view are let down. Destruction derby was added as free DLC.\nNow about the game itself. It is absolutely stunning. Not only the cars like in all racing cars, but everything... From the stylised menus to trees alongside the track. The physics are different from the original, but it still got the nice blend of arcade and sim. Where GRID was packed full of oversteer, GRID 2 actually has realistic understeer from time to time and changed the drift mechanic. It's not hard to get used to and shouldn't bother you if you're not that much of a sim-driver (If you are... why get GRID or GRID2 in the first place?) Variaty in cars is ever present. The focus on brands shifted a bit, we see a lot more Mercs/Jags in the game however the most awesome car in the world the Nissan GTR still has a big role in the game (with the DLC you have 4 kinds of GTR awesomeness). All with all I can say that Codemasters is back on tracks with games like Dirt3 and GRID2 and we should just forget games like Showdown ever existed.","December 30, 2013","true","53.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

GRID 2 is an arcade racing game without realistic driving dynamics. This game is for people who like going around corners drifting at 100mph as opposed to people like me who prefer having to actually touch the brakes at some point during a race.\n\nThis was even more annoying for me because it looks like codemasters have spent a lot of time and effort creating a stunning game engine with amazing graphics. The handling of the cars just seems to cheapen the game after all this hard work.\n\nSaying that, it's not actually a bad game; you just need to know what you are actually buying. It's a fun game for casual gamers and good value if you get it on sale. It is not worth the usual £30 price though.\n\nBuy it if you like arcade racers. Don't buy it if you don't like arcade racers.

I was severely disappointed. The graphics are what you'd expect from a game this new, but the driving physics are definitely a step further towards the arcade side, even compared to Grid 1. You can't turn the wheel more than 15 degrees off-center without the back end breaking loose, and don't even think about trail-braking into a corner. If you should have the misfortune to hit something, you're greeted with an insufferable camera angle and some visual effect that make it annoying to try and recover the car.\n\nAdditionally, customization options for driver aids and controller settings are nonexistant. If you're looking for a racing game that is at least somewhat realistic, keep looking.","May 3, 2014","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I'm having quite some fun with it. A bit different from the first one, but I woudn't say it's worse. It's easier and it feels easier (but not that easy) but, on the other hand, it's not so frustrating so it makes it a fun game to play both offline and online. I'd say it is not as serious as the original GRID was. It's a more casual experience that in my opinion isn't neither better, or worse. As stated before, just different with the same amount of quality. Graphics are nice aswell.

Then include tracks like Bathurst, Nurburgring\Nordschleife etc, and all the production and tuner cars like in GT.

No text chat in online mode.\n4. Terrible replay cameras. and it's had the worst replays camera compared to all Codemasters racing games in the past.\n5. Career Mode (Can't create the team name, no teammate system, race to earn the "fans" ?)\n6. Le Mans 24 hours event is missing.\n7. Drift events is terrible and so boring compared to the first GRID. (and the freestyle drift and full-lap drift mode is missing too. only point-to-point drift.)\n8. A.I. in Single Player are too rude especially in Season 5 even you set it on medium difficulty.\n\nGRID 2 is still the fun and enjoyable racing games with the variety of cars, beautiful scenary and mix of challenges. but if compared this to the first Race Driver : GRID, this is the dissappointment sequel because a lot of great feature that in the first game doesn't featured in this sequel.\n\n7/10\n\n(Sorry for my bad english skill and grammar.)","October 30, 2013","true","169.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The stuff I was hesistant about were nullified. The DLC isn't nescecarry since the base game gives you enough cars/tracks to enjoy yourself and with the sale the DLC weren't that pricey. No cockpit-view is a setback from the original, however I never really used it... There is still the bonnet view and for me that suffices, al though I can understand that the people who did play in cockpit-view are let down. Destruction derby was added as free DLC.\nNow about the game itself. It is absolutely stunning. Not only the cars like in all racing cars, but everything... From the stylised menus to trees alongside the track. The physics are different from the original, but it still got the nice blend of arcade and sim. Where GRID was packed full of oversteer, GRID 2 actually has realistic understeer from time to time and changed the drift mechanic. It's not hard to get used to and shouldn't bother you if you're not that much of a sim-driver (If you are... why get GRID or GRID2 in the first place?) Variaty in cars is ever present. The focus on brands shifted a bit, we see a lot more Mercs/Jags in the game however the most awesome car in the world the Nissan GTR still has a big role in the game (with the DLC you have 4 kinds of GTR awesomeness). All with all I can say that Codemasters is back on tracks with games like Dirt3 and GRID2 and we should just forget games like Showdown ever existed.","December 30, 2013","true","53.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There were a few things that I hated about the meta-game (career sp), for example, the animation that counts your fans after each race was un-skippable.

Codemasters continue their pattern of dumbing down their racing games in GRID 2.\n\nIf you want an arcade racing game with voiceovers telling you how awesome you are when you win races, a ridiculous storyline and ads being pushed in your face, then this might be the game for you.\n\nThe storyline removes almost any choice you have in how you play the game. There's no element of building your garage or team, as you're essentially a hired driver.\n\nIn terms of driving, before release the developers boasted about removing assists, such as traction control. This isn't true, strictly speaking. What you have instead, is traction control that's permanently on - perhaps at a slightly lower level than in GRID. This totally undermines the drifting minigame (which was quite good in GRID), which is now "pull handbrake on corner, and wait for car to auto-correct", essentially.\n\nCertain cars will have the rear step out given the right conditions, but broadly speaking all the cars handle the same. There is a fairly wide selection of cars, but when they're all the same and you have around 20 cars to pick from for a race, there's no point in picking any of them, except the fastest one.\nAdditionally, there are no interior views on the cars, like in GRID.\n\nThe game looks great though. The cars and scenery are well modeled, and there's a very nice lighting system.

I really, really want it to be good, but so far it's been frustrating to no end. The driving physics seem like they could be decent, but all the cars you get in the start are "Drift" class, where drift apparently means "Absolutely no road friction." It's seriously impossible to keep them from sliding. Now, this is bad enoungh on its own, but the A.I. is pretty much completely oblivious to your presence on the track with them, and has no qualms about ramming into you at any speed or position. Not only that, but they don't slide like you do. Ever. So instead of a crash where everyone is screwed up, they drive happily on by while you go careening off into a wall, left at the utter back of the pack. I thought we'd mastered A.I. that tries to avoid collisions in racing games, someone should really let Codemasters know. I should also note that I play with a racing wheel, so I should have the sort of fine control to avoid these things (and can in other games) but apparently that's meaningless here. I don't often ragequit games of any type, but when I do, apparently the game is GRID 2.\n\nTL:DR version:\nGood:\n-Game looks and runs great\n-Slick menus and dialog like most other Codemasters racing titles\n-Wheel support is great, you can feel the weight of the car and the road easily\n-Decent career mode\n\nBad\n-Game forces you into crappy cars with no grip\n-A.I. isn't subject to the same forces as you (they have seemingly infinite traction)\n-A.I. doesn't avoid collisions in the slightest, will run you off the road and laugh\n-No cockpit view (Seriously? Why?)\n\nI really, really hope I can at least get some cars with traction later into the game, but for them to force you to drive like a madman and then punish you for driving like a madman at the start of the game is stupid. Then again, Codemasters did decide that making an entire game out of the terrible Gymkhana events from DiRT 3 was a good idea... I guess they're going downhill.","January 2, 2014","false","3.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It features many different race types, such as endurance, time attack, head to head duels etc. There are fie seasons and four different vehicle tiers. As you proress toward world fame, you get vehicle challenges to obtain the more expensive cars.\n- nice enviroments and car models. They actually break, get damaged and this influences the driving. They are not as detailed as in Forza, but from behind it is fine. There are many locations, both in Europe, Asia and in the USA.\n- each car drives different. The developers really put the emphasis on car handling. You can feel them, especially through a controller.\n- Splitscreen mode is really fun.\n\nContra:\n-no cockpit view!!!\n- in normal difficulty and above the AI is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. It bumps into you in the corners - and everywhere else -  resulting in a spin out, accelerates to unreal speed if it wants to catch up with you and just before the finish line it goes hardcore and tries to ♥♥♥♥ you up. It was programmed so there is ALWAYS a driver who launches at the start like a russian torpedo, goes on the perfect lines. Then there's the next three driver, who often tend to race in a pack way in front of the rest. Problem is, you start at the very back of each race so going through all these idiots can be not only challenging but often frustrating.\n- the radio guy is a ♥♥♥♥♥.\n- car customization isn't deep enough. You can change only the tires, the rest is all about paint and sponsors.\n- I found only one bug but it was awkward, in Dubai at a night race the ligths started to flash like a strobe and I could barely drive safely because of that.\n\nIt's a great game with some minor annoying aspects, but mostly these can be solved by setting the difficulty to easy.","January 9","true","36.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Three times in a row. On the SAME EXACT TRACK.\nI will not really even try to explain here why this is NOT a tournament mode, but merely a "hey, you know what's fun? beating the same race, three times in a row" brainfart of an idea someone came up with at a design meeting and walked away really proud of themselves.\n\nSo yes, I'm thumbing this game down in my review because of this very idea, which in my personal opinion, completely broke the otherwise nearly-perfect arcade racer for me.","November 24, 2014","false","29.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","10","20","0","3"

But thanks to GRID 2, I can now catch up with the latest news on Sportscenter.\n\n10/10 would buy again to make the cable provider ♥♥♥♥ his pants.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter taking 15 hrs to complete the Single Player, here's a more serious review:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Long Single Player mode (easily 15 hrs+ if you complete every single event)\n\n+ Nice and wide selection of cars. Ranges from hypercars to the good old Silvia\n\n+ Presentation and UI. Clean and to the point with no unnecessary fuss. One thing I hate about racing games is the way they flash updates in the center of the screen. This one doesn't do that.\n\n+ Sound Design. Seriously, the best I found in a game. Engine noise changes if you lose the  exhaust and the engineer's radio transmissions become muffled when you are racing under a tunnel. Music is a bit on the relaxing and trance side which I kinda like but lacks the oomph required in a normal racing game\n\n+ Dat Red Hot brake discs tho. Nice attention to detail.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Gets repetitive.\n\n- NO COCKPIT CAM\n\n- Story is meh meh. By the time I reched Season 5 I was forcing myself to see if there was a nice ending.\n\n- Handling. Cars handle like the original GRID in drift mode. Too arcadey but I liked it for the first few hours of gameplay\n\n- Damage. The way the chassis sometimes bends with knocks and crashes is just unrealistic. After the really awesome and life like damage modelling in the original one, don't know what exactly happened here.\n\nBOTTOMLINE:\n\nPrepare yourself for a arcade game in a simulation setting to really enjoy GRID 2. There is no relation between this and the original. If you're lookin for something more motorsports career oriented like with teams you're better off with the original GRID or GRID Autosport (which is bloody awesome imho)","November 27, 2015","true","17.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

I dislike the fact that you are forced to drive different, garbage, stock vehicles. You can't invest heavily into a single car. To me, this makes all the difference. Multiplayer is a completely separate thing in itself. I've yet to find out what the money I'm earning is for. I mean when you start SP, you work your way to the top. In MP, regardless of your not being able to choose a vehicle for a race because you haven't went that far, you're still able to race with it. This feels weird as you're not accustomed to flying a jet in SP. The tracks all feel the same. The visuals, handling of the car and graphics are quite pleasing on the other hand.\n\nI'd recommend this game if you're looking for leisure, kick back with friends and play on a steering-wheel kind of thing.","June 22, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

WOOOHOOO! BEST THING!\n\nI like the single player, with the bots, because you can easily drift around and it is not always that hard to win and the bots are not idiots (most of the time) so they dont just bang into the side of you, and if they do, you can just use some slowmotion back in time to prevent that sh*t.\nIn ONLINE you need to start a bit behind after you get smashed and the player who did it wont even feel that big penalty if he succed to crash you without himself crashing. He earns a bit less in impact money, but ♥♥♥♥ that sh*t.\n\nI will give this game 8/10, because it is still fun and it is better if you play it with a friend. It is one of the best car/racing games with drifting i have played (i have not played that many racing games).\nThere is also a lot of custimazation (might have spelled that wrond) that can be done, which is great and i like that.\nThe things i find bad in this game is, as mentioned, the stupid players in ONLINE matches. Some race fairly enough and may hit someone, but not one purpose, but then there is those f*ckers who just come with 300 km/h and bang into the side of you and if you choose to respawn, then you will probably start behind them and if you get near them again "BANG MOTHERF*UCKER", you have crashed again.\nBecause of my rage i would almost give this game just 5/10 because of the people in ONLINE and the little penalty they get for crashing people, but that would be a bit unfair, because the game is not just about ONLINE and they can decide if idiots decide to play this game.\n\nI will recommend this game if you like a good drifting racer game with a lot of custimazation and i think it will be best if you play some SINGLE PLAYER before you start at playing ONLINE with high levels and crashers.\nUnless you like to rage and probably lose some times against crashers and high levels, then i would not recommend to play ONLINE. Of course it can be more challenging than SINGE PLAYER.","August 3, 2014","true","27.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

GRID2 contains a large amount of cars with various characteristics so players with different driving styles should be able to find something for themselves. Difficulty level of the game is pretty much unbalanced because on the same level some of the challenges are way too easy and some may cause serious problems. Unfortunately, there is also a small amount of race tracks and it's easy to get bored when you have to race on the same circuit over and over again. In overall the game is good but not great.

For those looking for a complete racing simulator, this isn't for you.  But for those looking for a fun, fast-paced racing game, look no further.  It's got a wide selection of cars which you can customize the livery and rims on.  While the tracks are limitied, it does help you with memorizing them (like real race car drivers do).

But thanks to GRID 2, I can now catch up with the latest news on Sportscenter.\n\n10/10 would buy again to make the cable provider ♥♥♥♥ his pants.\n\nEDIT:\n\nAfter taking 15 hrs to complete the Single Player, here's a more serious review:\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Long Single Player mode (easily 15 hrs+ if you complete every single event)\n\n+ Nice and wide selection of cars. Ranges from hypercars to the good old Silvia\n\n+ Presentation and UI. Clean and to the point with no unnecessary fuss. One thing I hate about racing games is the way they flash updates in the center of the screen. This one doesn't do that.\n\n+ Sound Design. Seriously, the best I found in a game. Engine noise changes if you lose the  exhaust and the engineer's radio transmissions become muffled when you are racing under a tunnel. Music is a bit on the relaxing and trance side which I kinda like but lacks the oomph required in a normal racing game\n\n+ Dat Red Hot brake discs tho. Nice attention to detail.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Gets repetitive.\n\n- NO COCKPIT CAM\n\n- Story is meh meh. By the time I reched Season 5 I was forcing myself to see if there was a nice ending.\n\n- Handling. Cars handle like the original GRID in drift mode. Too arcadey but I liked it for the first few hours of gameplay\n\n- Damage. The way the chassis sometimes bends with knocks and crashes is just unrealistic. After the really awesome and life like damage modelling in the original one, don't know what exactly happened here.\n\nBOTTOMLINE:\n\nPrepare yourself for a arcade game in a simulation setting to really enjoy GRID 2. There is no relation between this and the original.

If you buy it expecting a similar game to grid 1 or gran turismo you might get disappointed. It's a really fun game, specially if you are into the "Initial-D" series, but it's not something that everyone will enjoy.\n\nPros:\n-Beatiful graphics\n-Drifters paradise, with great physics for that\n-Great selection of cars\n-No glitches\n-Overall just really fun, specially multiplayer\n\nContras:\n-Not much of a simulator (if you are expecting that)\n-A lot of DLCs (almost required if you plan to play online)\n-No cockpit view or rearside mirror\n-Story mode is kinda short and not really interesting\n-Dumb AI\n\nIf you still have any doubts about it, here's a video that may make up your mind:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMZZq_I3KRQ","February 23, 2014","true","89.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I liked the original, and was pleased to find this didn't dissapoint.  My main complaint is they removed the awesome cockpit view from the original.  Otherwise it has been a great addition in the series, continuing the emphasis on driving and realistic racing without a focus on whats under the hood, which is a nice change of pace from other more sim-like racers.","March 2, 2014","true","14.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is not the same game as the original, It feels completely different. But that's not necessarily a bad thing, this is a very competent and fun racing game. The handling model is a lot more arcade based to the point where you mostly drift round corners even in grip class cars. This is sometimes fun to just sling your car round a corner but sometimes it can be frustrating with cars often sliding out of contol and straight into a wall. Where this game really shines is the design, this game is visually stunning and the audio for the cars is great. You can take some amazing screenshots of this game on nearly any track. It does still let you down in some bits like having no cockpit cam and the voice over constantly yapping in your ear can get very annoying, thankfully both these problems can be altered with mods. To me this game was just as good as the last and I was surprised to find it as good as I did after hearing countless people tell me it was crap. 8.5/10","January 10, 2015","true","26.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/recommended/44350/","TeenJackBauer","👌TeenJackBauer👌","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeenJackBauer/","435 products in account","Positive\n+ With a different career experience this time ‘round, the more story-focused single-player feels a lot more fleshed out than its predecessor. Feeling like a driving personality rather than a member of a team makes the solo experience much more memorable and charming. Clocking in at around 11 hours, the career mode is easily long enough to satisfy gamers who enjoy a bit of character with their driving experience\n+ Again, just like the first game, the handling strikes the perfect balance between simulation and arcade. While I will admit there is a bit more of a learning curve when it comes to oversteering (especially when it comes to drift events), and less customisation when it comes to driving assists, there’s still no denying that the driving is as fun as ever\n+ Different to the first game however, this game seems to focus a bit more on street circuits, as a lot of the newly added tracks take place in city streets rather than strictly closed-off racing circuits. This does give the game a slightly more arcade aesthetic than the previous game, but for me it didn’t really detract from the experience at all (though people who prefer simulation games may be put off by this)\n+ Compared to its predecessor, the graphics here are a definite step up. Every positive graphical aspect that was in the first game has been touched up and been given even more polish (though the bloom effect is a tad excessive).\n\n\nNegative\n- While the game does have a lengthy career, compared to the first game, there is a noticeable lack of variety in the courses. While the game does add a good amount of new tracks, it also reuses quite a lot from the previous game, which does hurt the total amount of different and unique tracks that you can race on\n- The same audio problem that existed in the first game is still present here, in terms of the in-game dialogue getting boring and repetitive. If that was an issue for you before, not much has changed unfortunately (though I do prefer the voice actor more so this time around).\n\n\nWorth Mentioning\n• Codemasters decided to remove the in-car view in this entry of the series. Personally, I have never used this view in a driving game, so the absence of this did not phase me at all. However, if you are the sort of person who does play their driving games using that view, then you will be disappointed in this aspect (though there is a community mod that adds an in-car view if you want to check that out first).\n\nVerdict\n“Just like its predecessor, GRID 2 is another highly enjoyable and fun racing game. While some people may be put off by the game feeling more arcade-like than the first one, for me, it didn’t deter me from playing the game at all. Another great driving experience!”\n\n8.5/10 TJBs","February 15, 2015","true","10.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I find racing games difficult to get into, often counterintuitive to control, and unnecessarily restrictive with cars and tracks.\n\nAlso, I'm terrible at it.\n\nHowever, I found myself in the mood for a fun racing game after playing GTA V with its many amazing modded cars, and saw GRID 2 on the Lunar New Year sale, so I gave it a try.\n\nI'm glad I did.\n\nPROS:\n\n- GRID 2 doesn't punish hilariously inept racers like me from the get-go. It does a great job of easing you in, and you can start on noob settings, like I did, or try genuinely difficult settings. It's great for all skill levels.\n\n- It's FUN! Some racing games feel stressful. GRID 2 doesn't. The game does a good job of capturing the joy of driving.\n\n- The controls feel INTUITIVE! You know how the best games almost make you "feel" obstacles with your controller, mouse, joystick or steering wheel? The games that make you duck IRL when you're flying below something, or recoil to dodge a projectile or piece of shrapnel? GRID 2 is the racing version of that. The controls feel completely natural from the start, and they are equally precise.\n\n- The cities are lovingly rendered. You can race through Barcelona and see the Sagrada Familia looming over the streets; rocket through brightly lit Hong Kong at night; cruise Dubai's ultra-modern tracks; race in the shadow of the Eiffel tower...and on and on. The background art in this game is spectacular.\n\n- It's well optimized. Framerate holds up fantastically, and I'm using a GTX 760, not the worst but not the best either. The important thing is, this game runs incredibly smooth, something that's always appreciated in a game where twitch response is important.\n\n- The cars are awesome. It's not exclusively supercars, although the game has its share of Paganis and McLarens. There are American muscle cars, drift cars from Nissan and Honda, and high-performance vehicles from makers like BMW, Audi, etc. The paint options are legion, with a shading system to get the exact colors you want, and choices between things like metallic, matte, pearlescant, flip, etc.\n\n- The game can be set to speak your real name, and your racing team leader gives you helpful tips when you're on the track or practicing. It's all situational, and so far it hasn't been repetitive at all.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n- While you can choose from any track (or so it seems) in custom events, you still have to unlock cars in career mode, unfortunately.\n\n- You can change wheels, but it's not clear if they're anything more than aesthetic changes. That's  fine with me, but maybe some people would want more depth.\n\n- I'm not Vin Diesel.\n\n\nOVERALL: Would recommend, even for terrible racers like me. Most of all, it's FUN.","February 21","true","6.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It never was or is. My recent interests in cars and all that further makes my screen name fitting, but that wasn't the original intent.\n\nGrid 2 is decent. It starts off strong. Amazing intro, right into action, with orchestrated and epic soundtrack pulsing as you pound the track in an old Mustang. Your handler can say your first name, out loud, from a list of common names. He says cool things while you're cornering... Heads up on collisions, or remembers that you need to work on sector 3 of the track. The damage effects are bland but get the job done. The graphics are fantastic. The style of the game is awesome. But it gets entirely bland about as fast as the races become.\n\nGrid doesn't know what it wants to be. You get Drift events, Japanese Domestics everyone loves like the Silvia and Fairlady Z.... You get some muscle... You get a slathering of European, German... And then suddenly, karts. Boring ♥♥♥♥ing Formula style cars. I hate the British love of motorsports with a passion. It has no soul. It has 0 anything interesting. It's boring and lame. And little Caterhams are ugly, and boring. Sadly, Grid 2 loves the British take on motorsports... And quickly the awesome Chicago, Miami and Curvey Japanese tracks give way to ugly, bland boring night time race-maps... They offer you a Jaguar, the almighty SLS AMG of course, the most boring and ugly Mclaren, and most European only vehicles by the time you're in Tier 3... But good luck winning any races if you do not pick the stupid karts to race alongside them.\n\nThat is a gigantic slap in the face. I like racing to be a test of REAL road cars and what a man or woman can do within a realistic, mostly every-day type vehicle. Track-only specific cars are ugly, boring, and honestly in my opinion an extremely lame lifestyle to pursue if that is your interest. And that's the issue. Grid 2 can't decide whether it wants you in the grounded, fun street race-style cars or in full on boring F1 style races. And in the middle it forces you to put both on the table at the same time, much to frustration and misery as one of the obnoxious AI is 6 seconds ahead of you in his little lame kart because you wanted to break the back-end out on the Jaguar.\n\n+Starts off strong\n+Fun handling and racing in the first 2 tiers\n+Great graphics\n+Epic soundtrack\n+A great overall presentation\n\n\n-Turns into F1 style kart racing quickly\n-Puts Caterham track karts agains full sedans in Tier 3, creating a gigantic rift\n-Forces you to drive karts to win\n-Tiniest selection of vehicles, a smattering of some greats, with little to no character\n-Lush lighting and car visuals give way to the ugliest track renders I've ever seen outside of the Japanese, Chicago and Miami tracks...\n-Can't decide whether you should drift, or keep it tight, the handling model in the game appears to give up and surprises you on every corner.\n\n\nIn terms of the whole package i'd say the game is a solid 6/10. Great graphics, great racing. The "car culture" style is nowhere to be found... Sterile and as dull as a doctors office...

Whoever had a handle on the production knew what kind of video game they wanted to make, and hired the right designers to do it.\n\nThe result is a super polished, fun, perhaps not particularly realistic (at all) racing game that's super accessible.\n\nProbably my only complaint is that it's slightly too easy, and the cars drift a little too much.

This is better in every way possible, I could not ne bothered to play the original but in this the UI feels modern. The cars drive well, you can feel/understand the weight transfer even using a game pad. This makes it fun to play. This is worth getting if on special.\n\nUPDATE: As you get further in you are forced to play bumper cars at the start of races to force your way through the pack quickly enough to have a chance to win races. The later levels also have a wild spread of difficulty that ranges from simple to insane and not much between. The hard levels are caused by stupid looooooog tracks with no run off and the need to use cars that handle really badly but really fast. Because of this I lost interest, shame as great fun until that pont\n\nUPDATE: Do not buy any of the DLC, it mostly appears to be based around online which is dead","March 5","true","18.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

In a last ditch hope the cars would improve I created a Tier 4 race and used a DLC car to test...I was still on ice and they were still on rails. I could forgive this if the tracks were at least designed with power-sliding in mind but it was like there were two different teams making this game. Team one designed the curvy, tree lined, cliff dropping couses with tight controls and handling in mind. Team two designed the cars and physics of said cars with wide fast tracks and arcade like controls in mind. Now the problem is it seems like they didn't consult with each other until the product was ready too launch and this is what we are left with. I wish at the very least the squirelly handling effected the A.I. cars as badly as it does me.

I've played allot of Grid 2 online, I've not touched on the single player (but from my brief peak, it looked rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because the buying mechanics were off).\n\nI've become very good at controlling the butter brick driving mechanics and consider this game to be a pick up and play sort of thing. The butter brick mechanics I've so aptly named makes the game a noble effort to gently encourage your car (this being the butter brick) in the direction you want it to career. But after hours of tedium you begin to master this and the driving becomes very arcade-y, and very fun.\n\nOnline, people are reckless and cause massive pileups on the initial corners of the track, which often screw your race up; but if you drive cautiously you can come out on top almost all the time. The rest of it is fun; the game is undoubtedly pretty and runs like a dream.\n\nI recommend this, but not for a simulator, or anyone looking for a 'realistic' experience.","December 28, 2014","true","108.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

They simply took the physics of DIRT and applied it to road cars instead. As you can imagine that doesn't really work too well once you get into supercars. AI is, quite simply, braindead. They do not react to player presence on the track in any way and in the event of any contact the player is screwed. AI vehicles appear to have the defensive abilities of tanks whereas you are sent flying at a mean look. The vehicles all look nice and the environment is kind of pretty but this game is only really worth it if you get it at a steep discount.","September 14, 2014","false","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is addictive and if you buy it, you will probably spend a lot of time with it. But there will also be a lot of anger and frustration. I won't mention multiplayer -- find complaints of hacked game servers elsewhere. I consider the Career mode the core part of the game. You haven't played a game untill you have finished the career, right? Now what I hate the most is that the game does not just offer a variety of cars. It forces them on you. You find yourself constantly switching from supercars to musclecars to hypercars to kitcars. No way to get used to anything. Also, don't think you'll get fair competition. There's no way to qualify in front. You always start from somewhere towards the back, where AI drivers are more than willing to bump you out of the track and into the railings every time you get near. There's no protection once they get close. Can you repay them in kind? No. They stick like tanks.\n\nOutside the track there's also little to look at. You will win dozens of cars in your career but is there a way do look at them? You can apply intricate colour patterns but there's no way to walk around watch. There's no upgrading until the end of the career. It's all a shame.\n\nIf you want to race, buy a real racing game!","February 14, 2015","false","43.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
