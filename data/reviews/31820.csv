Since there was a piece of it stolen it start's to run on it's own will - or so it seems.\n\nAgain the game uses the standard routines of interviewing people, talking with friends and try to solve riddles in the amusement park. All to soon it comes clear that all of the people you can interview might have a motive.\n\nTechnically this game is a point and click adventure, the game is aimed for younger female audiences, but again it's playable for all who like adventure and puzzle games. This series is famous for the sometimes creepy stories that are involved. Oh... have I told you that you can have serious accidents during the adventure? No... well... Now you know! Have fun bashing in your head. Don't worry since there is a cute replay option, something we urgently need in real life.\n\nI can recomend this game without further thought, it's nicely rendered, has a good story and some nice puzzles.","April 16, 2015","true","14.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I would recommend it, but if you are interested in a more drawn out mystery I would suggest the Ransom of the Seven Ships or the Haunting of Castle Malloy.","June 20, 2014","true","4.0"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

You're in computer class back in grade school, and you get some free time to play a game. No one's allowed to play Oregon Trail anymore after the high score was listed as "BUTTS," so you try some point-and-click adventure game you never heard of. It's cheesy and it doesn't look great, but it holds your interest enough that you finish it after three classes.\n\nThis is that game. Nothing more and nothing less.","December 8, 2012","true","6.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

The case itself isn't too complicated or dangerous but I still enjoyed completing it. Plus, you get to learn about carousels so that's neat.","June 23, 2015","true","6.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

So if you're new to this game style its a fairly good starting point even though its far into the game series. The theme was fun and creepyish (sound track is awesome), and if you actually read through the stuff and details in it you actually learn some neat random facts about carousels and the story line begins to link as you progress through. You are solving the mystery behind the carousel while at the same time helping another character in there reconnect with long lost childhood memories that tie in with the main story objective. I liked it, easy game and a nice way to pass by a slow Sunday afternoon. Been a fan of this series since I was a kiddy.","September 24, 2015","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They have you learn short hand and have a little computer code in it, and other fun puzzles. There are also two different mysteries to solve, so that helps keep things interesting.
