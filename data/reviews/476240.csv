It gets deceptively more challenging as you go on starting with basic moves to match a knight with his square to straight up insanity as you start working your choices several moves ahead like you would in a normal chess match.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun challenging game you won't go wrong here.  For 1$ it is well worth the price.","May 30","true","2.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

This game does exactly that; you instead shift Knight Chess pieces around a small limited board into their respective color positions.\n\nThe further you progress, the harder the puzzle gets as you have to move away pieces which can be already fitted into the correct positions to allow movement for other pieces to complete the puzzle.\n\n8/10\n","May 30","true","3.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

You must move the colored pieces into the corresponding squares. The game starts off easy, but gradually makes it more difficult, often requiring thinking and or trial and error.

The lack of animation can create a bit of initial confusion for where the pieces are, but this is a minor hurdle that you get used to after a few levels.  Nice music, basic yet compitent art and solid puzzle design make Knights well worth the super discount price tag.

While it looks like a chess game, it plays similar to a sliding puzzle in the sense that you make sequential moves and have to deal with spatial constraints.\n\nThe game features 82 levels, subdivided into 5 level packs:\n- Pawn: 9 levels\n- Rook: 12 levels\n- Bishop: 16 levels\n- Queen: 20 levels\n- King: 25 levels\n\nIt took me about 6 hours to unlock everything, at the time of writing this review I have access to the daily levels and I still have 23 King levels left to do.\n\nA very nice feature of this game is the fact that it offers new levels daily, which are randomly generated. However, the daily puzzles are only unlocked after beating the Queen level pack, which is relatively late in the game. The reason for this is the introduction of yellow ''obstacle'' knights in the Queen levels. I think that the unlocking of daily puzzles should occur after completing a few Queen levels, and not the whole pack.\n\nThe UI is minimalistic, which is nice, but could do with a few extras such as a redo button or an overlay to make some notes or scribbles on.\n\nThis is a nice puzzle game with a lot of playable levels and the price is fair. Absolutely a recommendation for anyone that is into puzzle games.","May 31","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"
