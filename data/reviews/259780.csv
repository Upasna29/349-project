I grabbed this game when it was on sale(currently still is at the time of writing) for $0.50, and its definitely worth the 5 bucks they are asking for it. For 50 cents its an absolute steal, a very fun time waster where you'll find some runs ending almost as quickly as they started. While others you'll see your hero snake grow into the double didgets, increasing the difficulty of dodging yet making it easier to slay enemies. Worth the asking price and I've had a lot of fun with it so far. Definitely a game for short bursts.\n\nPros:\n-Simple yet fun gameplay\n-Nice customization\n-Easy to learn, yet difficult to fully master\n-New and interesting take on the snake genre\n-Can be played in short bursts or long runs, depeding on your interest\n-Nice soundtrack\n\nCons:\n-Mobile port, options menu is lacking severely\n-Simplistic art style\n-Heroes aren't unique, follow similar styles.\n\nWait For A Sale","October 19, 2014","true","1.4"," 42 of 48 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","42","48","0","0"

The authors tweaked this game to require less grind, got rid of microtransactions, and made this version more generous (e.g., red gems are included from the start).  And the controlls are actually better on the PC for this case since you get more precision in moving your snake with a keyboard.\n\nThis game is a new twist on the old classic "Snake" but instead of a snake, you are a conga line made up of different heroes.  Heroes will randomly appear, and you simply touch them to add them to your conga line.  You die if you run into walls/monsters or if the health of your lead hero reaches zero.  The most exciting part of this game is trying to grow you line and finding the random power-ups.  You can be near death or overwhelmed and then suddenly a power-up saves the day.\n\nIf you sometimes just want a quick game to jump into, this game is perfect for a 15 minute session.  Also, there is an arena mode to this game where you can join a top guild to earn more gold.\n\nThis game taught me not to turn my nose up to mobile ports.  Fun is fun regardless of where the concept was first presented, especially if the controlls and price are fair.  8/10","March 1, 2015","true","37.4"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

The objective is to kill a number of enemies to proceed to another stage. You grow your snake through picking up heroes. The more heroes you have the easier for you to kill the enemies, on the other hand, this also makes you more vulnerable to getting hit because the number of enemies increases after each stage.\n\nI liked the concept of this game having a more than a dozen of heroes, each having different attack patterns. Each of them are also upgradable to help you survive the game in later stages. Decent game best played on idle breaks.","December 7, 2014","true","12.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Simple on the surface with a bit of depth underneath, such as your attack and movement strategies.\n\nI put about 5 hours into this game on my iPad before realizing it also made its way to Steam. I wouldn't say either format is preferable -- the swipe controls on the tablet of course are very suitable but the arrow keys (or joystick, or WASD) are just as spontaneous. I can't say the same for the mouse gestures though. Just a bit too much delay for it to be useful.\n\nOn the down side, this port feels like a quick dump to PC as there's no graphics or window options, no achievements and no cloud save. I still recommend the game for someone looking for casual fun, it's just too bad NimbleBit couldn't have put a bit (groan) more effort into the port.\n\n","February 4, 2014","true","2.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

I wouldn't recommend you buy it at full price, but since I got it at 50c I'm not complaining at all.\n\nAll Pay Shop mechanics have been removed, and the Coins (pay currency) drop frequently enough that I never found myself wishing for a new way to "buy" Coins. So it is fairly balanced in that aspect.\n\nThe game has no end, so it's a classic "Score" game.\nEasiest to start with the mage until you get the engineer, at which point he's the best starter I found.\nKeep your Hero levels fairly even, and pour ALL your money into the Shop (outside of buying Coins).\n\nHave fun.","October 19, 2014","true","6.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

You can spend 'tokens' to buy large boosts to damage, speed and health for runs through the game.  You can also spend them to continue your current run, but the cost doubles each time you do so, starting from one.  Tokens are rare drops, you get perhaps one every five levels.  So you're already stressed for tokens if you just use them as drops.  However, you can buy tokens for 'gems'.  Gems are your other ingame currency, which can be used to level up.\n\nAt a certain point in the game you simply need to level up and use the boosts to progress.  And that means grinding.  Lots and lots of grinding.\n\nNow I'm not opposed to grinding in general.  After all, playing the game is why we're here, so being forced to play the game isn't bad, of itself.  The problem comes when you have to to a number of 'bad' runs without spending tokens on the boosts so that you can then do a good run in order to get to the next level and unlock the next character.\n\nSo it's a nice idea, it's a nice game, but you can smell the scent of addiction mechanics all over it.  And it just isn't a good thing.\n\nNimble quest.  Worth your money, but not your time.","October 19, 2014","false","4.1"," 33 of 59 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","33","59","0","1"

I enjoyed playing it to a point, but it appears that much like a Premium title doesn' translate well to an IAP model, the reverse is also true.\n\nThe primary reason I enjoy the game was because I want to see more like it. I enjoy the creative twist on the Snake genre, and this game makes huge strides towards that end. Where it fails was the transition from IAP to Premium game. You find very quickly that the limited leveling system takes AGES. I've probably played this game for over 20 hours (most of my logged time was just having the game on while I did other stuff), and haven't yet finished leveling up all my characters.\n\nThis would be fine if the game content were showing me progress as I grind but its not. The same 8 or so levels repeat endlessly, just getting more and more difficult with each run through. So, it's up to you how you define "completing" the game. I'm sick of just playing through the same levels over and over again, and will be stopping my progress now, retiring the title in my library.\n\nIf you liked Snake, this title is definitely worthwhile and you can probably get a few hours of enjoyment out of it. But there are other, deeper, titles out there that are probably more worth your gaming dime.

You have to avoid different enemies on each scenario, each one with their own abilities  and also avoid contact to don't get killed. You collect coins which you can use to purchase essential power-ups on hard levels or even skip scenarios, as well as hire party members for the next level.\n\nAlthough the game have it's own currency, it have not something like micro payments or any indications of it. It's a pure grindy game as it is.\n\nFunny, addictive, awesome time killer.\nOr when you just wanted to recline the chair playing some funny arrow-based casual game.\n\nAbsolutely recommended, except it's not your genre.","March 19, 2015","true","40.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/recommended/259780/","FlyingShisno","Flying Shisno","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FlyingShisno/","769 products in account","I had this game on my phone, and put around a dozen hours into it and never got close to bored, and wasn't even mad/upset when I had to start over for the PC version\n\nThis is the classic Snake game with a twist. Instead of a 'snake' that get's longer when you eat a pellet, you're an adventurer/warrior, and the 'pellets' which drop fair rate are warriors that you collect and 'add' to your party. Your adventurer, and you party both attack the various enemies that run around the levels.\n\nEach warrior is unique in their appearance, stats, and the way they attack sometimes. The Mage is squishy but hurls powerful fireballs. The Knight has a lot of health, damage, and armor, but attacks at a somewhat slow rate. The 'Gizmo' is a little dude with goggles that hurls very powerful bombs with a large radius at a very slow rate.\n\nEach warrior can be 'leveled up' 3 times, each level giving new stat increases or sometimes even benefits. The Knights first level increases his attack speed, while his second and third levels increase his armor, which makes him very difficult to kill unless you decide it would be great to punch that 30 foot ogre with your face.\n\nThere are about 7 different arenas for you to progress through. You start in a forest, go on to a sewer, etc. When you reach the final area type and beat it, it loops back to the first forest, though the difficulty increases continue. And while I never done it before, I believe beating the final area the second time 'wins' you the game.\n\nEach time you beat a level for the first time(including the second trip levels), you unlock a new character. All characters you unlock can be picked up and added to your party during the game, so your 'length' get's quite long. For example, if you have 5 characters unlocked, your line can only get 5 long, and you continue to battle through the levels. If you only have 2 characters, then the line will only be 2 characters max. There's a total of 16 characters, which equates quite a long line if you can keep them all alive, and each one of them has a unique attack to add to your parties killing machine prowess.\n\nAlong with the characters and their 3 levels, there are power-ups that defeated enemies drop, and they do temporary effects like giving your a damage shield, freezing all enemies for 5 seconds, increasing attack speed for 30 seconds, replenishing health, etc. You can upgrade these items multiple times, 10 times I think, and each time increases its potency/length/radius depending on the item.\n\nAll in all, this is an amazingly fun game that I believe all should play. If you ever loved the classic Snake game, then this is absolutely a must buy even if you are bored with the original. I got this on a sale where it cost $0.50, but I would happily pay the full $5 for this great game.","October 20, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nimble Quest review:\n\nNimble Quest decides to put a spin on the classic snake formula by making the snake a conga line of adventurers who have to kill conga lines of monsters. Does it work? Yes.\n\nThe game is simple enough for almost anyone to pick up and play immediately, and just challenging enough to make you want to keep playing and unlock all the various adventurers. Nimble Quest features 16 unlockable heroes to play as (your snake will only ever be at most 16 units long, no duplicate heroes.) and they all feel different which is quite nice, 4 power-ups that can be dropped by enemies and upgrades for everything. this helps flesh out the game and adds more of a reason to keep playing just to see how far in you can get. Also there is a sizeable army of monsters to fight against as well. There's also guilds that you can make to try to become the best in the world w friends but they're not that special.\n\nAll-in-all if you like snake but wanna play a game that mixes up the formula than I say go for it.","October 30, 2014","true","38.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/259780/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","As should be fairly apparent at first glance, Nimble Quest is a re-imagining of Snake, only instead of the focus being on collecting pellets and avoiding your own ever-growing body, for the most part your body remains at a manageable size and the object of the game is to skillfully avoid enemies while coming close enough to get them in range of your attacks.\n\nThe game is originally from mobile devices, and to a degree it shows. Options are minimal, barely acceptable. UI is clearly designed for touch and though functional with a controller, really works better with a mouse. As a personal preference I prefer a d-pad for the game itself, though I'm sure the keyboard works just fine. It also has mouse controls that mimic the touch controls from phones.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty dull at first, to be honest. Playing it for than fifteen minutes at time before boredom sets in is impossible. The game was clearly designed as a grindfest. However, once you've done that grind, gotten your upgrades, and worked your way to the higher levels, the game becomes far more enjoyable. The levels are hectic and engaging, with enemies galore and items all over the screen, a far cry from the more sparse environments of earlier levels. Your line of heroes should be longer at this point as well, meaning you need to pay more attention to your own movements to avoid running into yourself. All the same elements are present, but the increase in the amount of things you need to process keeps you from just sitting and staring at the screen and lets you get immersed in split-second reactions. It's a great experience and a shame it's hiding behind the dull grind that may scare people off before they ever see the more interesting later levels. If you do wish to cut right to the chase and get to the good stuff though, it's a fairly simple registry edit (as far as messing with your registry goes, anyway, which isn't for everyone), and I wouldn't really blame you if you wanted to go ahead and skip the grind.\n\nAll in all, the game's got a good set of underlying mechanics hidden behind some unfortunate vestiges of mobile design. On sale though it's hard not to recommend, especially at the $0.49 I paid for it (and card sales bring that number down even further). If you're looking for a fast-paced arcade action game, this one does a pretty good job of it.","October 27, 2014","true","3.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/recommended/259780/","doomsdayforte","DF","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doomsdayforte/","936 products in account","I bought this game for $0.49 a while back.  I haven't finished it yet, but I think I have a pretty good idea for this recommendation.  Ctrl+F "TL;DR" to skip reading.\n\nNimble Quest is also available as a free-to-play game on mobile devices, and that's where I'll start.  Your purchase on Steam gives you the "Red Gem" DLC from mobile for free, and there are no microtransactions after that.  You can't pay real money to unlock additional heroes or to buy more tokens.  There isn't a demo of this game on Steam, but you can try it for free on iOS/Android if you have a compatible device.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple.  You start with a small roster of three heroes, of which you pick one to be the leader.  You start in a field and your ever-moving hero runs near (not into!) some enemies and starts attacking until they explode and vanish, leaving behind a gem you pick up.  Or maybe there's a powerup that gives you a temporary boost.  Or another hero.  Picking up the hero adds one 'car' to your train and also amplifies your attack power, but also gives you a tail to worry about.  This is an arcadey RPG Snake mashup.  Kill enemies, gather heroes, get gems and tokens, power up, and die.  Aim for the highest kill counts and gem collections!  Clear stages to unlock more heroes!\n\nSince this is a game of Snake, you have to mind the walls and your own tail.  If you run into a wall, an enemy, or if your leader gets hit too many times and runs out of health, you die and Game Over.  Assisting heroes have the same mortality concerns, so it's very possible that an enemy train can cut through yours and kill several allies.  And your leader running into your train will kill the assisting heroes you touch, so careful maneuvering is key.  I found keyboard controls much better than swiping on mobile, and you can even use a controller if you wanted.  Controls were WASD or the arrow keys to move, Enter and Escape to pause.\n\nThe big part of the game is killing things to get gems.  Clear a stage, get a small bonus of more gems.  Green gems are worth one, blue five, red ten.  Gems go to boosting powerups, giving heroes permanent upgrades, and buying tokens.  Powerups range from instant enemy-killing bombs to freezing all enemies in place to a potion to heal allies of damage.  All of these upgrades are pretty costly, but that's the name of the game.  And having the Red Gem DLC already means it's going to go somewhat faster than F2P.  Tokens are used for buying continues when you game over, entry to the Arena, buying buffs that last the current run, buying random unlocked heroes in the between-stages screen, and to skip stages you've cleared already.\n\nThe stages are square for the most part, with some exceptions like Graveyard having some obstacles or Courtyard having small alcoves, but the enemies are more interesting.  You have damage-sponge knights with big swords, or stationary archers that'll shoot arrows at your allies, or healers who don't attack but will heal enemies you haven't killed, or fast-moving rats or so on.  You have the same if smaller variety of heroes, though they shine a bit more with upgrades since they can do different things like explode and take out enemies on death, or soak even more damage, or heal on dealing damage.  There don't seem to be any boss battles in this game.\n\nDifficulty is pretty linear.  The game starts out slow with spawns and introduces new enemy types at a decent rate, but you'll quickly have to learn how to manage multiple enemy trains and your allies' HP.  You'll run into some cases where you just can't advance through a stage without spending gems on upgrades or tokens on buffs, but in the latter case, the game at least is pretty generous on its drops.  You can also earn tokens through the game's only form of 'multiplayer' in the Arena.  You're put into a Guild to start, which is nothing more than "#NAME" or whatever, but the game autopicks a hero you may or may not have and then a set of enemies and you just aim for the high score.  You don't play with anyone, but it's a form of co-op if you think about it.  Depending on how well you did in your guild and how well your guild did worldwide, you get a payment in tokens.\n\nI also thought it was a cute touch with the descriptions you get on how you died, like "Merida tried to knock over a healer and lost" or "Uther made friends with a hairy rat" or so on.  There seems to be a death description for every stage and every enemy, possibly for dying to its attacks and for running into it.  It was also a nice touch how the hero sprites change slightly with each upgrade, like Ulrich's armor getting golden additions and his sword getting bigger or whatnot.\n\nTL;DR:  For 49 cents, this game was a steal.  $5 may not be so bad, too.  It's got pixel graphics, tight control, decent music, and there's quite a bit of replay value.  There is a good variety of enemies to kill and be killed by, and buying upgrades does have a noticeable effect on your heroes and powerups.  It is admittedly grindy and can be repetitive, but I don't think it's a game you can just sit down and play for hours on end.  It's perfect for if you have to wait for another game to install or update, and you might find yourself playing a little longer than you expected, trying to beat your last high score or get just enough gems to get that upgrade you've been wanting.  I know I didn't pay much, but I really got my money's worth out of the game.  And I'm still not done.","November 20, 2014","true","6.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"killed 500 guys!" achievements, but more like "killed 10 guys with one bomb as Gizmo" type challenges. :tlove: gaining new characters is it's own sort of in-game acheivement mechanic but gets really repetetive and frustrating farming past The Depths to buy not very interesting upgrades. Some random maps, secret passages, narrow racetrack challenges, destructables, or bosses would reaaally have made sense for a PC version. ...not to mention keybindings and gamepad support. :nogo: not that i'm holding my breath for any sort of further effort on the part of this developer. i'm pretty sure it's only $5 so that they can say "look! we marked it down 50%" eventually. is it fun? yes, but most people would be lucky to get about a dollar-an-hour of fun out of it so wait for that sale.","December 29, 2013","true","6.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your snake consists out of heroes which you pick up by killing enemies. You keep unlocking them by beating levels. These heroes can gain levels and have different styles of attacking enemies on the screen. Just like in Snake, you have to avoid walls and in this case enemies to survive, but you also need to guide the rest of the line out of the way! If an enemy touches somebody in the middle of your line, the hero dies and your party gets smaller again. They also can be killed by enemy attacks. The game keeps going as long as you, the leader , remains alive and that can be achieved with the help of power-ups and some buffs you can buy before starting a round.\n\nThe currency system, which is gems and tokens, allows you to then boost the duration of power-ups or convert gems into tokens. Gems can also be used to level up a hero faster. Tokens are used for the buffs you buy before staring a round and they also have the use to continue a game when you died. Both of these currencies can be obtained without microtransactions, so don't get fooled by the design of it looking like it would be the case.\n\nIn a nutshell I have to say that the price seems fair for this fun game. It offers enough content and also gives you the oppurtunity to play it even when you have only a bit time on the hand. So revive your old-school feelings for Snake and refresh them with this variation of the main-idea!","December 15, 2013","true","3.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Yeah, but only if you don't have to do the same thing all over and over and over again.\n\nYou can upgrade the heroes, which is nice. But if you lose, you have to pay tokens to continue where you left. If you run out of tokens, you need to buy some with gems. At the same time, you're trying to level up a hero, but you can't because you just spent your all gems to tokens!\n\nI don't like the idea that this was made for a computer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chillibreath/recommended/259780/","Chillibreath","Chillibreath","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chillibreath/","1769 products in account","The biggest problem I have with the game is how much grinding you have to do in order to get anywhere.\nIt is another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mobile port so what did I expect? The options menu has only; sound on/off, music on/off and tutorial on/off. So make sure your screen can handle 720p because that is what the game is looked at. You can't run it in full-screen or rebind the controls (only arrow keys and WASD) because that will ruin the idle way of playing the game through the developer's eyes.\n\nShame on you Nimble Bit!\n\nIt does have support for the Logitech F710 out of the box, so that is something nice I guess.\nThe game-play is simple, but punishingly hard, after two hours of playing I only got to “castle 1” which is the fifth level out of 14? The problem is that the enemies have too much HP so I can't kill them fast enough until the whole map is swarming with them and I just die.\n\nIt is possible to level up the heroes, but that too takes ages to do because of how little experience point they gain each kill. It is possible to bypass it with gems (in game currency), but it costs a lot. They have three levels each, which will increase attack speed, strength, range or add a special passive ability like HP drain or stun.\n\nThe levels are not that big so it's a bit annoying that the game can't be set to a higher resolution so the whole level can be viewed at once. Therefore, it is very easy to walk into enemy archers or mages and end up dying because they can't be seen.\n\nYou can continue form where you died, but it costs a special coin to do so. Which you can gain as a random drop or buy them in the shop for 1000 gems each. The gems can also be used to upgrade the heroes if you don't want to grind for enemy's over and over. It costs 1000 gems the first level and 10.000 gems for level two, don't know what it is for level three since I only have played it for about two hours.  You can also buy increased time for some of the item the emery's drop at random at the shop for 320 first tier, 720 for second tier, 1520 for third tier, and 2530 for fourth tier, and the last and fifth tier I don't know. (the prices may be off, but you get the idea of how they increase.) I got around 1000 – 1300 gems (depended on how many chests-drop I got) before the fifth level and died.\n\nSo you are better off starting from level one and using the coins in the arena or buffs before a level. The arena it's a 24hour, one life, clan war fight. You have to have gotten to “courtyard 1” before you can enter and spend your coins on it, then you can choose a clan to join or make a new one by typing it in the box that shows up. The arena is a one life, daily challenge, where you get one random hero to use.\n\n\n+ It looks OK.\n+ The fonts and menus looks nice a bit big maybe.\n+ Supports Logitech F710, bought joystick and directional keys.\n+ Has 16 characters to choose from, must be unlocked.\n+ Has 14 levels.\n+ Don't take too long to beat a level.\n\n- Don't have a resolution option, so it is stuck at 720p.\n- Can't set it to full-screen, so it's stuck in window mode.\n- Can't rebind the keys, only arrow keys or WASD for movement.\n- Slow to progress further into the game.\n- Slow to level up the heroes.\n- Has a special coin for continuing and arena mode.\n- Pickups only works on the first hero, making the shield useless.\n- Game never told me if the upgrades works on the heroes you add to the line.\n\nRunning on version 1.0.8\n\nI cannot recommend this weird snake clone because of how slow the game is.","November 10, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It functions the same as the old Snake game everyone would play back in the day on their Nokia phones. Difference is, Nimble Quest is that plus an RPG like simplistic system. You have certain heroes and you're objective is to complete certain dungeons in order to get more of these heroes (increasing the maximum capacity of these heroes per game), upgrade the older ones and increase item's usage. Thing is, it's grinding all the way. It's gets boring very quickly, and there are some dungeons you can't simply complete (chaos everywhere). I suggest you either get the game, give a try (it's five bucks, not really expensive) and check if you're up for all the grinding, or simply turn the other way and save your money, as I cannot recommend this game.","June 7, 2015","false","2.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I do like this game. I find it an enjoyable time-waster, but I wouldn't recommend this game for $5. I personally think that $5 is asking a bit too much for this game. Anyway, on with the review!\n\nThe gameplay is very basic. Use the directional keys to move the line around. It is basically the same control scheme as the old Snake games on the old moblie phones. The idea of the game is to defeat all the enemies on screen to progress to the next area, unlocking new heroes as you progress through the game.\n\nThe graphical style of the game is quite cute, with the little chibi heroes and the block-y backgrounds. Makes the game feel like a kids game, and kids always get the best sort of games.\n\nMusically... I can't really have any inupt here. The music is inoffensive but unnecessary. I turned the sound off on the second time I played this game, and just have my own music playing over the top of it. It doesn't affect the gameplay at all.\n\n\nI do genuinely enjoy this game, but I really do not think it is worth $5.\n\n\n\nA sly bit of self promotion now, I have done a blind Let's Play of this game.

Grindy in a good way.\n\nThe basic snake game meets an action-rpg with lots of characters to unlock. The gameplay is addictive. Graphics and sound serve their purpose. There's no gear, but in addition to character leveling, there are permanent over-all upgrades and per-game buffs that can be purchased with in-game currency. When you die you go back to the beginning, but character level and upgrades are permanent. (Continues and level skips can also be bought with coins.)\n\nThe original mobile version was free,, but had in-game purchases, whereas this version is $5 with no in-game purchases. Apparently, the game was not re-balanced because of this change, which makes the game a little grindy. But personally, I like it. Levelling and upgrading are very gratifyinig when it only comes with lots of gametime and good strategy. I think these changes make it much more what one would expect from a PC game, compared to the original model. Not having in-game purchases makes a game seem more legitimate to me, and I don't mind paying 5 dollars for that feeling of legitimacy.","April 22, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is its PC port (see the disclaimer below). You choose a character to lead a group of characters that you collect throughout the game (or purchase with "coins", see above) through an infinite set of levels. You can also collect temporary powerups that can be upgraded for "gems" to last longer.\n\nOverall, I have fun playing this game - although it's of a very grindy nature, the graphics and music fit the game style quite nicely. The game has lured me into wasting so many hours on the mobile version, and the PC version continues to do so.\n\nDisclaimer: this game is NOT freemium, unlike the mobile version. You are paying for a full game, there is no outside currency or Steam Wallet involved. The most valuable currency, "coins", can be purchased in-game with "gems" that you collect while playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anasto/recommended/259780/","Anasto","FAZI DI BO!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anasto/","1570 products in account","Nimble quest is an unique game. It's basically a snake game with cute graphics and RPG-ish features. You start with a few heroes and each have different attacks. You pick your leader and join the fight against the various creatures the game has to offer. As you fight through the level and you kill the monsters, some will drops buffs while others will drop other heroes. As you collect more heroes your snake will become bigger and bigger. As you go through the level your heroes will get hit and eventually die like you. However the game only ends if the leader dies (the hero you start with).\n\nOverall i think the game is fun for a few minutes and then it'll just be boring. You're basically forced to upgrade your heroes to beat the levels and you can only do that if you kill X amount of monsters with the leader (10k monsters for level 2 which is A LOT!) OR get enough gems in a SINGLE run to level up a certain hero. I haven't played the mobile version but i'm sure the tokens act as a P2W thing which you need to buy with real money. That doesn't happen in the PC version but they are very hard to get. Tokens give you powerful bonuses that turn the game into an easy mode pretty much.\n\nI'm going to recommend this but it's pretty boring after a while and the only thing unique about it is it being a snake game.","October 20, 2014","true","3.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will say though Nimble Quest is a fun game and it brings back some nostalgia from the old mobile game snake I sank hours into snake when I was younger. I load up this game when I'm waiting for a dungeon in WoW or Rift or when I just wanna play something quick and simple. All in all I would say out of 10 I would personally give the game a 7/10 if it is on sale as for the non-sale price I would say it is a bit to high but on the plus side there is no in-game store to have you spend even more money.","November 8, 2014","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

To my surprise, this title is great fun and I've found myself wandering back to it time and again.\n\nI won't bother to describe the basic gameplay, as everyone's already done so and it's exactly what you'd expect.  There is a bit more strategy to the game later on.  The non-upgraded characters are mostly fairly similar in terms of usability and only when fully powered-up reveal their respective strengths in play, with previously-entirely-unwanted healers and freezers becoming surprisingly useful as leads.\n\nThe game is not without fault: collecting the sizeable numbers of gems needed to upgrade all characters to level three and complete the last levels is taking a very long time.  I assume this reflects the pay-to-play nature of the original, but these character upgrade costs definitely need to be reduced for the desktop game.  On the plus-side, as grindy as it is, I'm still enjoying just playing towards the finish, as much as I would have liked to get there sooner.\n\nThe developer is NimbleBit, although they're strangely shy about putting their name on Steam.  This seems to be the only thing they've ported so far.  I hope we see more of their work in future and I hope especially for a bigger, better sequel to Nimble Quest, which very much deserves it.\n\nOn the whole, this is very much an underrated title - I recommend it highly to anyone who appreciates this kind of old-school gameplay.  Kudos to NimbleBit, for creating a game that is far better than its humble mobile origins would suggest.","November 8, 2014","true","41.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are really nice and the soundtrack is surprisingly not as irritating as I thought it would be.\nAt the start you might have some trouble getting past the levels, but it's not meant to be played start to finish in one single try. The fact that you 'have' to upgrade the items found in-game and your heroes to get past the higher levels doesn't bother me at all. I'm all for finishing a game as quickly as possible, but I'd like some collecting and 'training' to go with it. For those who find that levelling up the heroes by playing with them individually goes to slow, there's that nice invention called gems and though you have to play the game to get those gems, it goes considerably faster.\nSo far I also have had no trouble with getting tokens, yes they are dropped sparsely but that's kinda the point, isn't it? Many a game I have been that close to finishing the level and been killed, walked against an enemy, etc. and then you have to choose to try again or start over.\nEven though this game can frustrate you a lot, I can guarantee you you'll be clicking the play button more times than you can count.","October 25, 2014","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Whether, for mobile, tablet, or for desktop, Nimble Quest will keep you entertained for hours on end when you need it.\n\nA great "toilet seat game" in which it provides hours of fun in short quick bursts when you need to zone out and it does the job well. The game mechanics are well balanced, and the game provides that nostalgic arcade like gameplay that many games have seem to forgotten. So If you're looking for depth, NQ doesn't have depth, but if you're looking for something to keep you entertained for a while then this is the game that will do that job exceptionally well.","January 30, 2014","true","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/myimor/recommended/259780/","myimor","A Paragon Protector","http://steamcommunity.com/id/myimor/","1185 products in account","This game.. looks a little shallow. It sort of is. It's casual- take Snake and put some light RPG elements in the mix, dress it up.. bam, Nimble Quest. Don't expect it to be anything else and you'll come out content.\n\nDo you like getting upgrades? Seeing how far you can get, then trying to get a bit further? You'll enjoy this game. There's 16 different Heroes- you start with one. Beat level 1 and you unlock the second hero, beat level 2 and you unlock the third hero, etc.\n\nI said it's like Snake, and it is. Instead of growing each time you get an apple (or whatever it was for that game), sometimes killing enemies will give you a hero that will join your conga line- only heroes you've unlocked can join you, so the more you unlock the longer your line can be and thus the more damage you can do and longer you can live.\n\nAdditionally, enemies will drop gems (currency) or pickups such as a bomb that will kill all the enemies in a certain radius when you pick it up or an ice crystal that will freeze all the enemies in the game area in place for a certain time which will allow you to murderize them with impunity.\n\nEach hero has 3 upgrade levels: when you start a game you choose a leader. Getting kills will give the leader hero experience, and you'll level them that way, or you can spend the money you earn to level them faster. Each hero gets a specific buff at each level (they might shoot faster, hit harder, get more armor, root enemies with each attack, etc), and each one is noticeable. It's not like "oh I got this guy to the next level, cool..", you see them do more damage or live longer.\n\nAdditionally, you can spend the money on upgrading the pick-ups that enemies will drop- just a tip, do this first before you spend any money on levelling a hero. It's just much better to get that done first.\n\nThis is a fairly rambling review, but the game is absolutely wonderful especially at a $5 asking price. The only problem I have with it is that there are no achievements, but depending on your stance that may not matter in the slightest.","February 24, 2014","true","17.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Grindy in a good way.\n\nThe basic snake game meets an action-rpg with lots of characters to unlock. The gameplay is addictive. Graphics and sound serve their purpose. There's no gear, but in addition to character leveling, there are permanent over-all upgrades and per-game buffs that can be purchased with in-game currency. When you die you go back to the beginning, but character level and upgrades are permanent. (Continues and level skips can also be bought with coins.)\n\nThe original mobile version was free,, but had in-game purchases, whereas this version is $5 with no in-game purchases. Apparently, the game was not re-balanced because of this change, which makes the game a little grindy. But personally, I like it. Levelling and upgrading are very gratifyinig when it only comes with lots of gametime and good strategy. I think these changes make it much more what one would expect from a PC game, compared to the original model. Not having in-game purchases makes a game seem more legitimate to me, and I don't mind paying 5 dollars for that feeling of legitimacy.","April 22, 2014","true","16.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Haven't played it the day I got it, but it's still pretty fun nonetheless.\nI have it on my phone, and it's exactly like the game "Snake", but with a twist. There's powerups, different characters that serve different purposes, and a lot more.\nExcellent little platformer Indie game if you have a few bucks.","May 7, 2015","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cute little 2D snake-like arcade game and I love it. My friend gifted it to me for my birthday and it's just great! It's basically an upgraded version of snake with heroes with unique special powers. You're goal is to collect gems and destory enemies which is harder than you think! But, yeah, I really recommend this!","November 11, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not too hard, not too easy. You can unlock characters and upgrade them. It's really cool. It's a game you can play when you're really bored. You can always come back to it. It doesn't have a story or anything, it's just something fun you can spend your time on.","May 11","true","48.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, there's no way it's worth $5 - I played this game on tablet for free, and that appears to be exactly the same version that's on Steam at this price. I could be wrong, but it seemed to me to be identical in terms of gameplay.\n\nI do endorse picking up this game, but just get it for free on iOS or Android. There's no reason to drop five bucks on it, here.","June 4","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
