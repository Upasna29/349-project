However, it's been centuries there since her first adventure. Now, it's time to save again the Lost Lands!\n\nThis game is a sequel of the first Lost Lands. We find Susan again, in a fantasy world, with a standard gameplay. However, while the story is still good, I'm disappointed on the less variety of the HO scenes. Indeed, exit the list and the replace the object. Only the shapes scenes stayed. As for the puzzles, they're easy to do, even if some requires a little reflexion.\n\nI find it very long, maybe because some cutscenes are long in dialogues.\n\nHowever, the game comes with a lot of bonus: the chapter is telling the tale from the dwarf's point of view, just sometimes before Susan's arrival and during her quest. You can play minigames outside of the game, you have concept arts, music tracks and other interesting stuff.\n\nThe graphics are good, really fitting into the Lost Lands and the mysteries behind. However, when in presence of some characters, they can explain the surrounding to you like the dwarf in the mines or the female warrior in the bonus chapter. The sountrack is pleasant.\n\nAnyway, was I bored by the game? No. Is it better than the first one? Well, while they've reduced the variety, it is still very good. Are you lost during your quest? You may be clueless by moments or because you have many items in your inventory without knowing what to do.\n\nAnyway, it's still a good bargain. So, well, go for it!","January 19","true","11.7"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","15","15","0","0"

Point and click, hidden object, some potion-making.\n\nNothing overly mindbending here, but should you get stuck, there is a built in walkthrough (though even that won't solve all the puzzles for you).  The game's difficulty varies on how much or little help you want (ie, easier difficulties highlight important objects or tell you where to go next on your map).","July 22, 2015","true","6.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Though Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure is created by the same developers, Five-BN, and quite possibly occurs in the same world, these games are not related by storyline.  Though it would be interesting if somehow the developers managed to tie the storylines together.\n\nStoryline: A few centuries have past in the realm of the Lost Lands and a new threat has appeared in the form of the Four Horsemen: Chill, Flare, Death and Darkness.  These Horsemen are slowly and methodically destroying the Lost Lands world and Maraan, the wizard/druid sets a spell in motion to bring the warrioress and once before savior back to the Lost Lands.  The intrepid Suzanne is teleported to the Lost Lands where she embarks on the quest of defeating the Horsemen and finding the Compass of the Worlds (the key to a magical portal) before one of the Horsemen does.  For help on the quest, Maraan sends a dwarf named Folnur to Suzanne as a guide, to protect, and to provide useful information.\n\nGameplay:  A quasi-open world with area based bottlenecks, and more of a Point and Click then Hidden Object quest adventure.  The Hidden Object scenes are silhouette finds of the interactive type.  Each Hidden Object scene shows silhouettes which when found are then used to do other things like open boxes, scrap wax from a table, cut roots out of the way, etc.  until the main object of the scene is obtained.  Nothing overly difficult though some intuition (such as looking in baskets or crates) and careful searching is required.\n\nThe Point and Clicks aspects are more complex and require not only careful searching of an area to find all the needed inventory items but often travel.  There is a no penalty fast travel map which the further and further along in the story the player proceeds the more and more the fast travel map is needed.  Many items and several puzzles found early in the game or in previous chapters can not be accessed until a later time when the needed inventory is eventually found.  If playing on casual mode these items and locations are highlighted.  If playing on Hard mode, notes or a good memory is needed.  The game will give the player hints about where to find something, such as 'Where have I seen that before?' among other comments.  There is also an in-game strategy guide if one gets stuck or can not find an item needed.\n\nThe puzzles are mostly sliders of some variation, straight picture sliders, put the correct piece in the correct place, and rotating sliders.  There is also matching, codes, and picture puzzles.  Nothing overly hard, but there are a few puzzles that do require some thought to solve.  NOTE: One particular puzzle in the beginning of the game has an achievement attached if the player can solve it in less then 70 moves.  The in-game stategy guide does the puzzle in 92 moves, so achievement hunters will have to earn that one on their own.  (This puzzle can also be accessed through the mini-games in the Extra menu after both the main game and bonus chapter are completed.  So no need to play the entire game again just to play the puzzle.  Love, love this feature.)\n\nThe bonus chapter concerns the dwarf Folnur who Maraan has asked to help Suzanne after her arrival in the Lost Lands, and Folnur's preparations to do that and to craft a magical dwarven hammer.  In the main game the player sees his arrival which is the conclusion of the bonus chapter.\n\nThere are two sets of extra finds: 1) is morphing objects (35 total) and 2) machine parts (35 total) found through out the main game.  If the player finds all 35 pieces of the machine this unlocks a bonus feature which is a set of extra puzzles.\n\nA few words about achievements: All achievements can be earned in a single playthrough since most are gameplay oriented.  For one achievement the player can not use any hints DURING GAMEPLAY in either the main game or the bonus chapter or in any puzzle or Hidden Object scene which is standard.  One achievement is found in the bonus chapter and is a timed picture puzzle.  Also both the main game and the bonus chapter must be completed to earn a couple of achievements.  If the player missed the puzzle achievements during gameplay they can be earned through the mini-game section in the Extra menu.  That is so innovative and eliminates a forced second playthrough.\n\nExtras:  First of all there is the in-game strategy guide which makes playing the game on Hard mode the first time through easier if the player gets stuck or misses some needed item.  This game has many extras which become available after completing the bonus chapter.  Extras include wallpapers, concept art, music and cut scenes.  It also includes a replay of the 21 puzzles found in the game and 3 picture puzzles.  If the player found all of the machine parts there are 20 extra pipe puzzles to solve under that bonus feature.\n\nOverall, an enjoyable game to play, not too hard and not too easy.  Despite a bit of fast traveling near the end of the game, it plays smoothly and relatively logically.  Well worth the price.","January 21","true","21.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/recommended/372940/","talgaby","talgaby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/talgaby/","334 products in account","Short version: 76%The Four Horsemen is a beautiful lightweight adventure game with great puzzles and a long play time… although a large portion of that time will be spent by ungodly amounts of constant backtracking.\n\nLong version:Although it is not uncommon, it is still interesting to see when a casual series decides to switch genres between games. Lost Lands: The Four Horsemen is a good example for this. Unlike Dark Overlord, which was a hidden object game, this one is closer to a lightweight point ‘n’ click adventure that tried to include as many interesting puzzles as possible as a consolation for HOG fans.\n\nSadly, it forgot to get rid of the biggest issue of the last game, the constant backtracking that takes up almost half of the 5-8 hour play time. They just masked it with another great story, where we can meet the heroine of Dark Overlord, who this time is summoned back to the Lost Lands in order to help the fight against the titular Horsemen. She may be a little too okay with being dragged into a fantasy conflict against her will, but it is hardly recognisable with this interesting plot and engaging puzzle design.","February 12","true","6.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The story was interesting and the game play challenging.\n\nI found the game to be more puzzles than hidden item games. The hidden item scenes were all the type where you have to find pieces and puzzle solve to complete a goal. That being said, I have nothing against those types of scenes  but am a fan of more traditional item finding. That being said, all the scenes and puzzles offer a good bit of challenge and works your brain so don't think that this is push over game.\n\nWith the puzzles also come an engaging story. You play a woman from the Earth realm summoned to a magical land to save it from doom. Sadly, our hero Susan doesn't say much but everyone else has solid voice acting. I was quite a fan of  the dwarf you gain as a sidekick.\n\nOverall it's a definate buy for fans of puzzle games and hidden item games, it will offer quite a few hours of enjoyment.","August 3, 2015","true","8.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

Lots of minigames and puzzles, the hidden object scenes are interesting because you have to find tools in a specific order and solve minipuzzles to complete them and find the final object needed to continue the story. The game in general is very well detailed with several different scenarios, there's also an extra chapter with some backstory and a nice bonus game unlockable finishing the main story.","September 9, 2015","true","6.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The puzzles are quite good and there is good variety and interesting things to do (mini-puzzles) even within the Hidden Object Scenes.   The story isn't bad, and the animations are quite good.  This would probably place in the top 25% of HOPAs.\n\nThe bonus chapter was also really good. It served as an epilogue to the main game and also had a couple references back to Lost Lands: Dark Overlord.  So I would suggest playing that one first, although I think "]Four Horsemen" is a slightly better game.","January 1","true","5.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/recommended/372940/","emblemparade","Emblem Parade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emblemparade/","3117 products in account","The prequel, Lost Lands: Dark Overlord, is an excellent game, and this sequel is even better. Though it thematically fits in the "casual point-and-click and hidden-object game" genre, actually it is mature, long, and difficult enough to appeal to fans of "classic" point-and-click adventures. There are actually very few hidden-object scenes, and though there are several mini-game puzzles, most of your time will be spent in thinking about how to use the objects you find.\n\nIt's long, with a lot to do. I played it in expert mode, and it was quite challenging indeed. The bonus chapter is a fun prequel that satisfyingly fills in a gap in the story. There are lots of attainable achievements, and they are fully synced with Steam.\n\nThe graphics are good, and the cut scenes are exceptional. The story is neither amazing nor original, but serves well to keep the adventure going.\n\nVoice acting here is a significant improvement over Lost Lands: Dark Overlord. The characters feel fleshed-out and flavorful.\n\nHighly recommended for fans of the casual point-and-clicks and HOGs!","September 20, 2015","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game reminds me a lot of the lord of the rings movie before the nasty ring took over. You have the wizard who could look like gandalf. You have the dwarf gimli. Then you have the hobbits here they are called the halflings. You also later run into some bad guys on horses. I should mention you also meet a werewolf. So their is that connection. The graphics and sound are very good.\n\nThe heroine who you play looks a great deal like sarah palin. I am not sure if thats  deliberate or the guy may just be a fan of hers. The glasses and hair really look like hers a lot. A very interesting game as it does contain pages of the lore of the story that you find along the way. I really like how these games are made. Artifax could use some of these game mechanics. The best part is the extra goodies your supposed to find are labled on the map to make it a lot easier to find them. Arti needs to put this idea into their game maps as its next to impossible to find all of their special objects.\n\nA very fun and good time for HOG fans like me. Pick this up if your fan of Lord of the rings like me.","September 8, 2015","true","9.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"
