Go to the official Bohemia Interactive forums and check the threads "Iron Front as mod in Arma 2: Combined Operations" and "Iron Front as mod in Arma 3".\nThis is a very lovely tribute based on the Arma 2 engine. You will enjoy all the richness of features - open world scenario with an editor for unlimited possibilities. All troops and vehicles are high quality and high in detail. Weapon and vehicle sounds are also pretty decent. Playing the mission "Normandy crossing" gave me that immersion, only the Arma series can provide. Laying there with my team at dawn, covering in the grass and behind bushes. Looking at the wonderful colors of the sky, listening to the beautiful soft wind breeze around our helmets and for a short time I remember how it was playing in the wilderness as a young kid. But then reality forces me to focus ont the gravel road to the west. My team hears it - I hear it. There it is. The terrifying whistling and twittering of German tank tracks coming closer and closer. They are less than 200 meters away, but we still have no visual contact. Oh god, save our souls. I order my team to hold fire. Then we have visual contact to a German halftrack fully manned with troops. I know, that the only possibilitiy to survive, is to take out the gunner first, because he can erase our whole team with one single blast. They come to a halt, just 50 meters away from us. This is our chance! Quickly I focus on the gunner and order my members 2 to 5 to attack him, the rest of my team will handle the two guards on foot to the left and right, Open fire! Lucky us, the gunner and guards drop immediately, but the whole squad now disembarks the halftrack, running for cover. A fierce battle ends as we empty our last mags into the one Kraut calling for reinforcements. We check the dead Germans for ammo, gear and weapons and say goodbye to our fallen comrades. Suddenly we are shocked to death. There it is again. The whistling of death....","October 18, 2014","true","1.7"," 84 of 91 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","84","91","4","0"

I liked and played Red Orchestra 2 a bit too but RO 2 just left me wanting something deeper. I've read alot of negative reviews but I have to say that this is a great game for alot of reasons.\nThe first things that's gonna hit you is that it's really just ArmA 2 set in WW2 but all the things that made ArmA 2 great make this game great too. There are thousands of little hidden surprises to discover.\nSure there werent alot of people in servers but just like ArmA 2 i just created my own offline server and the game filled it with bots just like Arma 2. For me that means infinite replay value. (and thats before i even get to the campaign or scenarios.)\nSome people say this game is more system heavy but it looks just like Arma 2 to me...what i did notice was that the game lagged out on the Normandy D-day scenario...just too much going on for the game to handle..everything else ran fine though.\n\nThe skins and weapons look fantastic and flying those ww2 fighters is more fun than ever...youd swear you were playing IL2 sturmovic.\n\nStraight away I can see that this game is going to give me months of single player replay value just like ArmA 2.\nMany people complain about jittery controls on the Arma Games...all i can say is that if you have a decent PC and dial in the game then it runs smooth and accurate. I always turn of all post processing and anti liasing, mouse smoothing etc because I want the controls to be as fast and accurate as possible. The game still looks great and it's as responsive as any FPS if you do that.\n\nThis game really is a real WW2 simulator. Open world and huge. All the things that RO2 aspired to be but didnt quite achieve.\nLike any game there will be the odd bug or two but I'm very glad i got this game (in the christmas sale)\n\nYes..you will probably have trouble finding online players but if like me you just wanted single player with infinite replay value then this game definitely hits that mark. Personally I don't care if nobody knows about this game, to me it just makes it one of those hidden gems that is enjoyed by a select few. I've not played the 1944 Arma 2 mod people are referring to here, but now that I have this game I dont see why Id need to...this game has everything I wanted.","December 24, 2013","true","2.5"," 75 of 85 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","75","85","0","4"

This is where the series faulters, however...\n...we still love the heck out of it. For me, ARMA is one of the greatest series that have been developed, and Iron Front is another great example of what the Real Virtuality 3 engine can offer. The game runs and performs almost identical to ARMA 2; same interface concepts, same mechanisms, same method of processing, however it's set in the time of World War II with different weaponry and scenery. It's a very solid game and if you enjoy the ARMA series, you will certainly love this. It's unfortunate that GameSpy took this game down with it, so really the only way to enjoy this with friends is through LAN or converting the mod to ARMA 2 using this[forums.bistudio.com] thread.","September 25, 2014","true","6.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

BUT, if you own ArmA 3, using third party software known as "Play with six", content of Iron Front can be shared with ArmA 3 which means the multiplayer can be played again (although I have not tested this option yet, so I cant tell if there are many servers running). If ArmA 3 isnt in your game library, you can play it with friends only using LAN (hamachi too).\n\n-The second one are the bugs. Game itself works perfectly - what I love most about all ArmA games (including Iron Front, which is practicaly the same) are mission editor and multiplayer with community made scenarios. I dont play developer-made missions much, because they have always included bugs which prevents you from completing them. This applies to Iron Front even more. Campaign is so horribly broken, that you cant even get past the training, if you are lucky, then you will end up in the first chapter without being able to continue due to the bad scripting.\n\nSo to put this short:\nPros:\n-ArmA 2 that is set in World War II\n-Quite satisfying content in terms of vehicles, weapons and units (excluding planes, for example only one fighter for Luftwaffe)\n-Realism\n...and all the things that make ArmA good\n\nCons:\n-No online multiplayer in vanilla version\n-Campaign and missions bugs\n\nMy conclusion: If you like ArmA playstyle and WW2, buy Iron Front on sale and you will like it.","May 4","true","0.9"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","94","15","16","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delta895/recommended/91330/","Delta895","Internet Explorer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Delta895/","89 products in account","7.8/10\n+Realistic\n+Massive Maps\n+Extremely Customizable\n+Intense Combat\n-Clunky Controls\n-Dumb AI\n-Graphical Inconsistancies\n\nI think this game gets too bad of a reputation from those who pick it up for the first time. Let me preface this with a couple of things: Yes, it does have bugs, Yes it does have graphical inconsistancies (Low res textures, shoddy character modeling, etc), Yes, it does have a complicated control scheme, and yes the AI isn't exactly top notch. With all of this in mind I still would recommend this game; not to players who are familiar with fast paced shooters like Team Fortress, Call of Duty, Battlefield, or anything like that, but to those who are looking for a realistic, stategical, satisfying tactical experience.\n\nLet me address the first problem many players complain about: The control scheme. To be honest, I don't get what the big deal is. I mean if we are talking bare-bones-pick-up-and-play-with-no-prior-knowledge-of-the-controls gameplay, you WILL find that it is a bit clunky, but if you stop and go to the settings, you can customize the control scheme virtually to any way you want. There are a lot of actions that you will not use, so simply map those away from the main controls. You have the ability to map buttons to the same command, making them toggleable. So realistically, just map the controls to the way you are used to them and everything will be fine.\n\nThis game offers an assortment of different units, guns, and vehicles to play with. All are historically accurate and accuratly designed. The sound captuing is a little iffy, as most weapons sound the same. This game drops you in the shoes of either a German soldier, or a Russian soldier (or an American if you buy the DLC). The maps the missions take place in are rather huge, and the gameplay time from mission to mission can vary from 10 minutes, to 2 hours, depending on how you play. The  battles feel very realistic. This game can prove to be very difficult to those who like to run out into the open and play super hero. The good/ bad thing about that, is that you will have to start from the last checkpoint if you die, so this game forces you to move slowly and assess the situation.\n\nYou are in control of your AI team mates most of the time. This is the only instance where the controls, for me, got clunky. To select a unit, you will push the F1-F12 buttons, and to issue a command, you will find it by pushing the 1-0 keys. In the middle of a firefight, this can become tedious, and will often result in you either picking the wrong command, or scrolling through the number keys to find the command. It also doesn't help that the AI react slowly, so if you tell them to hit the dirt, or give suppressive fire, they will think about it for about ten seconds before acting, but this is only when there are many units on the field at once.\n\nWhile I do not have the patience to describe every aspect of the game, I can tell you that this game has flaws, but if you are looking for a good, strategic game, this is the one to buy. It needs work, and I hope they make a second one with fewer bugs.\n","December 19, 2013","true","11.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

Great buy and i would reccomend this game to any of my army loving friends! keep it up","August 6, 2014","true","88.0"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

Hopefully the Iron Front Revival Project will fix the issues left behind.\n\nEDIT:  Updated review.  Highly recommend this game especially since the conversion went through.  Not only are you able to play Iron Front as a mod in Arma 2 CO but Arma 3 also.  Now that it runs as a mod in Arma 2CO/Arma 3 this allows you to use other mods to enhance your game play even more.  There are even more mods made for the Iron Front conversion available at Iron Front Fans Forum, ex: new units and weapons, bombing fix, graphical and AI etc.","November 7, 2013","true","174.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The D-Day Add on really adds to the game, it includes fixing a few bugs and a lot more scenarios. The scenarios, instead of focusing on infantry most of the time, have the player playing as a commander of a platoon of M4 Shermans hunting Tiger tanks in the middle of the night. The other scenario (this one is my favorite) puts you in the boots of a Colonel commanding basically a battalion. But anyway the original storyline is fun but I tend to appreciate the German storyline better. If you buy the game you might agree with me. But the Russian one is fun too, but your first encounter after the tutorial tends to be quite annoying. But either way I recommend this game to anyone looking to buy it.","December 30, 2013","true","34.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Also adding to the feel of realisme is that the missions at the German side can actually be done in the German language. The dialogues are in real time (no dubbing or sychronising) german. Very well done by the game makers. It is based on the Arma engine. So that can be quite demanding on the hardware and smoothness of the game. But the games can be very entertaining.

Its surprisingly good at  that side of things. Built on the Arma2 engine, not a mod, and not to be confused with other Arma WW2 mods.\n\nRecommended more for hardcore Arma fans than casual gamers though.\n\nowners of Arma 3 can play Iron Front in Arma3 via play with six. That means multiplayer as well as better graphics, and its been made available for easy install in Six with the approval of the game devs and BI studios for existing owners of Iron Front.\n\nApart from that its basically Arma in WW2. The usual Arma controls we have all come to love and hate, the arma engine warts and all, clunky AI, but plenty of addons and user created missions and scenarios, and the familiar arma editor.\n\nNote that there are "lite" (free, lowe res graphics) versions of Iron Front you can try before you buy\n\nTL/DR: single player or LAN only - no multiplayer support. Other good Steam WW2 are availalable (R02, Rising Storm, etc). Very worthwhile to play in Arma3.","June 9, 2014","true","1.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is obvious that the developers put a lot of time, effort and heart into the game (even though there quite a few bugs).\n\n• Mission Editor - Great mission editor (if you're familiar with the one from ArmA II, then you'll know why).\n\n• Co-op - This game features quite a few co-operative missions and there are plenty of high quality co-op missions made by the community.\n\n• Moddable - A lot of people here may, probably, disagree with me here and say that modding is not supported, but that's just half of the truth. The truth is that you can import the game into ArmA II, and ArmA II is moddable.\n\nCons\n• Sound Effects - Some sound effects are pretty terrible, such as the Kar98k and Mosin-Nagant (which is a shame since they are the two most widely used weapons in the game)\n\n• Voice Acting - The voice acting is pretty meh, but what pisses me off the most is the Russian voice acting; the quality of the microphone that was used to record the Russian voice actor's voices is atrocious. The voices sound fuzzy and have a lot of artifacts.\n\n• Small Multiplayer Community - If you're into multiplayer and multiplayer only, I don't recommend that you get the game for that as the multiplayer community is very small.","December 13, 2012","true","51.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are a lot of problems though.\nPros:Very fun if you like the genre.\nYou can sometimes be killed by stray rounds, like in real war.\nIt can't really be scripted to be exact, meaning anything can happen any any time. Murphy's Law is here.\nYou can play with a different guns vehicles etc. You can play with both airplanes and tanks in the same battle.(Also infantry.)\nMy favorite_____The editor lets you build any game you want. You want a massive tank/plane/infantry battle with 200+ guys on each side, you can do it. Do you want to make a mission where you assassinate a Nazi/Soviet/American leader, you've got it.\n\nCONS: Terrible engine, just like the others in Arma 2 etc.\nGlitches happen way too often. One time I set up a massive game air/land battle between Soviets and Germans. I was playing as a Soviet Rifle men when I noticed German tanks 20 feet from me, yet no had fired a shot. Neither side lost any men, even though they went right by each other. I ran across the field and shot a German soldier, and none of his friends even reacted. They just laid there while I executed them in the middle of a field surrounded by other Germans with rifles. Needless to say a glitch made the armies ignore one another.\nThe grenade system is poor.\nIt feels like the Devs got a little lazy on the creating vehicles front. There are only two airplanes types per nation. The Sherman is used by Soviets and Americas, even though the Soviets have none of the KVs. Americans only have the Sherman as a tank. I've seen mods created by average Joes that are leagues better than this entire game. There are also no mods, because the devs thought it was a bad idea or some stupid ♥♥♥♥.","December 29, 2014","true","31.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rubberjohnny/recommended/91330/","Rubberjohnny","MiG-21bis Fishbed-L","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rubberjohnny/","380 products in account","People have complained that this is just "ArmA 2" in the Second World War. They also complain that there are "too many" WWII themed games. They also just got ArmA 2 for Day Z. While it's true there was a time when WWII settings were popular, this was late 90s, to mid 2000s, spurred on by the success of MOH:AA and the first CoD. When CoD struck gold with MW, the emphasis went to modern warfare and then when L4D did the same, now we have zombie titles as far as the eye can see. So, in otherwords, these people are morons.\n\nSo, Iron Front is $29.99. A fair price. What do you get from it? The best incarnation of the ArmA 2 engine and a much more well developed experience than ArmA 2, especially in regards to vehicles combat. They optimized their game very well and are clearly lovers of the history here. The hardware, all of it, is pain-stakingly detailed and accurate. The powerful ArmA 2 mission editor is there, the AI is improved, it's all an improvement on ArmA 2. For $29.99? Yeah, this is all worth it. An obscure theatre in WWII is welcome and the developers have already released DLC for it. Two campaigns covering the Soviet and Wehrmahct forces in both English and their native languages. The developers are history buffs and did the subject matter due justice without showing any overt bias to any faction. If you love sims, if you love more realism in you games, this is one you honestly should get. It's clearly made BY history buffs FOR history buffs.","December 18, 2012","true","70.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The single player campaign is lacking though.  Its worth a punt but it's clumsy, but it does have its moments.\n\nThe real single player benefit is generating your own battles.  The ability to jump from different player positions is awesome;  for example, it is easy to set up a defence of various German emplacements, be it Pak guns, machine guns, tanks, squads etc,  than let the Russian onslaught commence.  If one position you are manning is destroyed just move on to another unit.\n\nTank battles are particularly good and make up for the lack of decent WW2 tank games.  Especially as you can quickly mould a battle as you wish in teh editor.  Need another bunch of T34's ?  It takes seconds to add them to the mission generator.\n\nGraphics are good too.  At times photo realistic.\n\nIf you are into WW2 stuff, and long for the ability to recreate WW2 battles with numerous tanks, guns, planes and inftantry this game is for you.\n\nJust dont reply on the single player missions.\n\nThis game deserves more kudos in my opinion, I highly recommend it.\n\n","May 8, 2015","true","19.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The majority of the unit graphics are debatably nicer than that of some vanilla ARMA 2 units. Likewise, most of the units available in Iron Front : Liberation 1944 look authentic and there is a fair amount of equipment from late in the war. Sadly, these are the only real compliments that come to mind when I think of this "game."\n\nSo what's the real problem here? Well, first off: The AI is pretty anemic. A hallmark n00b gripe with ARMA is that of the omnipotent and almighty - "Uber Cheaty" - AI (with eyes in the back of their collective head.) Sadly, this isn't the case for the AI in Iron Front : Liberation 1944... In fact a major complaint about this "game" is that the AI is dumber than a box of rocks and as a long time (since 2001) ARMA player, I'd have to disagree...\n\nDespite the fact that Iron Front : Liberation 1944 is built on the ARMA II engine and despite the largely identical command menus, I feel as though something was lost during the total conversion... So much so that the AI in Iron Front : Liberation 1944 appears to be dumber than a dump truck load of boulders.\n\nAs an example: I watched two opposing tank platoons pass right by one another without firing a shot. Being the commander of a lead tank, it was my experience that the command menu in Iron Front : Liberation 1944 is almost completely useless. Due largely to the inept, incompetent and insubordinate nature of the AI in this "game."\n\nAfter watching the enemy tank column pass by my platoon at point blank range, I tried giving each of my tank gunners their own specific targets. No results... Ok, well how about each of you try opening fire? No? Not interested? Ok... Maybe we can all just stand around, hold hands and discuss how we feel? Would you like to do that? Guess not...\n\nDon't worry though, the AI's lack of sighting, reporting and automatic engagement skills isn't likely to result in any casualties... Realistically, I don't think that any of the AI driven units in the "game" actually pose a threat to the player. However, I do think that boredom is a serious threat to anyone who plays Iron Front : Liberation 1944.\n\nWhich brings me to my final point, is this a "game" or a "paid total conversion mod?"\n\nAs a standalone game, the AI is pretty lacking, there is no default CTI mode and the majority of the maps are pretty small... Even if you consider this as a paid total conversion mod of ARMA II - it lacks the depth of content you're likely to find in some unpaid addons, mods / total conversion for the various versions of ARMA...\n\nWhich ever way you approach this - I think that if you really want an ARMAesque, WWII experience, you would be better off finding your own collection of WWII addon units and maps for ARMA I, II or III...\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIs Iron Front : Liberation 1944 a decent, large scale land / air WWII sim?\n\nAbsolutely! If you could consistently get enough players together for huge multiplayer battles it would probably be a pretty fun game.\n\nIs Iron Front : Liberation 1944 a complete ARMA II experience set in WWII?\n\nNope... Too much functionality and challenge was left behind... The reason the ARMA series has been so successful has been its community, both in terms of players and content makers... Which is something that Iron Front : Liberation 1944 currently lacks.\n\nUnless you've got money to burn - this game is a pass.","October 27, 2013","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a WW2 simulator with the focus on infantry tactics. You can use tanks, vehicles and planes, but they're not 1:1 simulated. Good, but not prefect.\n\nThe power of Iron Front comes from the close to real approach of the correct presentation of all uniforms, ranks, languages (with dialects) and human dialogs.\n\nThe game shows you, during the campaign, that war is no place for heroes and that you're as good as dead if you think that you're the best fps gamer in the world, because you know how to play candy strike ehm..sorry..counter strike.\n\nIf you like hard core gameplay, stick to this. Many features, many options, but brutal as hell. If you want to brag about you kills and upgrades, stay away. There're none in this game. And it does matter if you kill some one to make sure he's alone. You don't want to fight a squad of angry soldiers on your own.\n\nNOTE: You do need a rather high-end game rig for this game, otherwise it won't run smooth enough. But, if you got that..

Also all the weapons, vehicles, and uniforms appeared to be very realistic.\n\nThat being said, this game does have its fair share of bugs. My biggest problem was with the graphics, as they appear to require a super computer to run on maximum. I dont have a top of the line gaming comuter, but I can run battlefield 4 at nearly 40 fps. On this game I had to set everything to low to even get around 24fps, and at that point textures were also flickering out and not loading. Simply, it is a great game idea and has the contents to make it really enjoyable, but there  are a few technical issus that can potentially make it unplayable.

But actions take place in WW2.\nGame dont fit people who like fast and "meat" battles. Here you need tactics and full organization of events. Without it... It dont worth playing.\nSounds are not real for some small arms, vehicles are fine. And bombs make you pee in pants. About 40+ servers, but only 2 was with people (first - 20, second - 5). Others are empy.\nGame is not popular. That is not we expected. But with good organization on servers (for e.g. some kind of weekly events) game will became interesting.\n<<<<<<My mark is 6.5/10>>>>>>\n\n-----------------РУССКИЙ-----------------\nЭто та же Arma 2. Но действия происходят во время Второй Мировой.\nИгра не подходит людям, которые любят быстрые и "мясные" бои. Здесь нужна тактика и полная организация мероприятий (игр). Без неё..... даже не стоит играть.\nЗвуки некоторого оружия не настоящие, техника в порядке. А бомбы заставят вас описаться в штаны. Более 40+ серверов, но только 2 из них были с людьми (на первом - 20, на втором - 5). Остальные пустые.\nИгра не популярна. И это не то, что мы ожидали.

I bought this Digital War Edition for £5 because it was cheap and I think that this game is amazing; it has some bugs (which game doesn't?) but it is a very good simulator and the singleplayer is just amazing. You can create some epic battles on these huge battlegrounds.\n\nTake little notice of the negative reviews if you want a World War 2 simulator because this is a brilliant game for just that; the negative reviews are mainly a cause of the original game being very buggy but most of this is now fixed and the game is currently being "unofficially" patched through community patches which you can fine on Google.\n\nThere is also a mod available which allows you to turn this game into a mod for ArmA 3 so you can play this game on the ArmA 3 engine with the new physics and the new graphics; you should check this mod out as it is amazing and I do believe that it allows for you to play the multiplayer as well since it goes through ArmA 3 and not Gamespy (which is shutting down) like this game does.","June 1, 2014","true","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Aside from that, though, I would recomend it, perhaps after a few DLC's or large patches have been realeased.\n\n\n\n-EDIT-\n\nAfter owning this game for a few more months, I have to say, without a lot more content, moding support and a massive patch, this is not worth buying. First, the factions. We get Germans, Obviously, but then Russians, and now.......Americans!  Who fought the ALONE before they decided to show up? That's right! Let's see the British Armed Forces DLC for this game. Second, No modding. NO MODING. They had the nerve, in 2012, to release a game that prevents all modding. Even if the game didn't so obviously need mods, it's offensive to make a PC game, and then restrict the most obvious advantage our platform has over the Consoles. Putting all that aside, I maintain that there is potential here, just un-tapped pontential. My angry, pointless two cents, GD1138.","July 6, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Strategische, anspruchsvolle und äußerst spannende Gefechte an der Ostfront, wahlweise auf russischer oder deutscher Seite. Realismus pur dank dem Arma 2- Grundgerüst. Am besten für Kenner der Arma- oder Operation: Flashpoint- Reihe. Die einzelnen Missionen können sehr langwierig sein und locker 2 - 3 Stunden dauern. Man muss taktisch und im Team vorgehen, Einzelgänger haben keine Chance! Man beginnt als Schütze, muss aber bald seinen ersten Infanteriezug befehligen, und das ist bitter nötig um die Missionen zu erfüllen. Später im Spiel gesellen sich ganze Panzerzüge dazu. Der Spieler kann (und muss) sämtliche Fahr- und Flugzeuge selbst steuern, allerdings sind bei Panzern mehrere Soldaten nötig, da jede Position im Panzer besetzt sein muss, damit er am besten funktioniert. Wer sich einmal in das komplexe Befehlssystem reingefuchst hat, wird mit spannenden und nervenaufreibenden Gefechten in  wunderschöner Grafik belohnt. So gut wurde die Ostfront in noch keinem Shooter umgesetzt! Störend sind höchstens die etwas mangelhafte Wegfindung der KI-Kameraden und gelegentliche amerikanische Sprachsamples (Kein deutscher Landser hätte damals "Oh ♥♥♥♥!" oder "♥♥♥♥!" gerufen), die noch ein Überbleibsel aus dem "Hauptspiel" Arma 2 sind.","July 20, 2013","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
