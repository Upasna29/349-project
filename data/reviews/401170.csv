You have abilities, which act more like spells, such as raising a pet skeleton to help you fight.  You don't really use your sword for swinging, but use it to cast disease at your enemies.  You have crowd control via the use of fear.  You suck rage from enraged monsters to do finishing blows.\n\nThis game feels very much like a 2D version of WoW in some ways, since you need to cycle through all these different abilities in order to killing everything.  You have quests to complete, where the UI feels very much like playing old Everquest than anything else.   You even hail people.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the mouse is a bit over used.  You (1) move with right-mouse button, (2) target with left-mouse button, and (3) select an ability also with left mouse button.  It would have been better to at least allow you to use WASD keys for movement, or to bind keys to the abilities.  As it is, it feels a little cumbesome to play.\n\nEven so, the textual descriptions are fairly decent. While not being overly long, they have enough role-playing angst in trying to get your supposed fiancee to make them interesting enough to read.   The sound effects are pretty humorous, especially when you are strutting around in your clunky suit of armor.  It sounds like you are in desparate need of a can of oil.  I like the little pools of blood when enemies die.\n\nOverall I would say while this game is a bit rough around the edges (such as sprites disappearing when moused over at times), it is charming enough for a few hours of play.","November 6, 2015","true","0.5"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","1"

It plays like a realtime tactical game; combat is done in realtime "rounds" and you hit abilities to queue up for the next go around. Combat against a single monster seems pretty straight forward, but taking on multi-monster encounters, or strongholds with waves of enemies and bosses with unique mechanics requires finding effective combinations from a variety of abilities. I've been fiddling around a bit and while you start to learn a handful of combos you can apply to a variety of fights, some bosses seem to require you to figure out new tricks to pull.\n\nI haven't played too much of the campaign yet but I defnitely recommend it first before trying skirmish or multiplayer; the tutorial at the beginning is clutch for understanding the unique combat system, with the combat rounds and rage mechanics. I initially went right into a skirmish map and even on normal difficulty I found the most basic encounters challenging, until I started to learn what the abilities do, and how much stronger you get when you use the right combinations or rotations.\n\nThe game presentation seems fairly simplistic at first but the more you play the more you start to get the "just one more minute" feel. A lot of the old school touches are there, including the stories, having some mystery about items and bonuses, and the fact that as you beat harder fights it really feels like you are the one getting more skilled, rather than simply your character.","November 6, 2015","true","9.1"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

Fights consist of exchanging spells, scaring enemies so that you can pick them off one at a time, taking advantage of their rage and unleashing it against them for mega damage. Very intelligent and original spin on the action rpg.","November 6, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"
