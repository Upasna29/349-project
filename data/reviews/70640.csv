The original is special. Its dated look and feel have aged respectably rather than stagnated (the bright coloured candy canes and bug eyes of Worms 2 look a bit naff today wheras the detailed, carefully-drawn objects here still look wonderful - see the Satan statues straight out of Shadow of the Beast).\nThe smaller selection of weapons make the game more strategic and engaging, allowing it to retain an element of skill and a rising tension. And this version alone retains a great sense of fun and exploration that the many rehashes seem to replace with cynicism.\n\nOnly in the original 'Worms' will you find a huge collection of gorgeous, hand-drawn custom stages that smash into pixels when you play on them, or a lovely, extremely 90's full-length re-mix of the theme tune hidden in the options menus. And only here will your worms shout 'suck on this' in a silly voice before shooting a pair of 'wanted criminals' named Robson and Jerome in the face with an uzi. With their last ounce of strength. On the Statue of Liberty. With a worm's face on it. This version has heart!","May 10, 2015","true","18.4"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","29","30","4","1"

If you aren't familiar with this game, you're either too young to have had the pleasure of playing it or simply unfortunate enough to never get around to it. Truly a masterpiece of a game for it's time, this is the game that put Team 17 on the map and strengthened their reputation as a company.\n\nDespite it's revolutionary past, Worms hasn't really stood well against the test of time, it hasn't aged very well at all, unlike it's sequel series of games  (Worms 2, Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party) which are timeless and still loads of fun to play to this day.\nI'd still recommend picking up the original Worms for the nostalgia value, despite DosBox being a nightmare to work with on modern machines. If you are new to the series however, I would advise picking up Worms Armageddon instead, it is vastly superior and has been updated over the course of time to compensate for modern computers.","July 12, 2015","true","3.8"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","26","30","2","4"

In 2016, after SO MANY YEARS, this game isn't probably best choice for session with friends. I mean, people loved Worms Armageddon, Worms World Party is my favorite Worms games, new players are probably in love with Worms Reloaded or Revolutions. First Worms game can be only played out of curiousity, how this all started. Older players for sure love first Worms and play it once in a while but nobody else will spend days playing it. It was my first time in two years (and first time on Steam) since I played Worms. Didn't spend much time but had my dose of nostalgia. Team17 had great idea for game and even with using same scheme in every next game (except spin-offs) they are making every next Worms game better and more fun. Old Worms works fine on modern computers and, at least in my case, didn't had any trouble running and playing it.\n\nThank you Team17 for starting such a great series, (almost) never dissapointing.

Having been playing Worms series for at least 15 years, they never make me feel jaded however. Instead, I still play it on my phone, pad, and Xbox. About this oldest pixel Worms, my advice is, if you are not familiar with DOSBOX or, not from DOS era, don't play this, grow some pubes first and play other Worms instead, because they are pretty famous on mobile platfrom, lots of young people know its siblings like Reloaded from Symbian as well, you can easily get used to the control.\n\nMany people dislike pixel games because modern games have greatly advanced graphics, but most of modern games are just for fastfood culture, in another word, one-offs.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).\n2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.\n3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.\n4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.\n5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.\n6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

I had played Armageddon before either version. Everything should make it not NOT recommended. The graphics aren't as nice, the weapon selection is limited compared to the other games, and this was apparently before they added online play. But...there's a special charm when playing this version of the game that makes me like it nearly as much as Armageddon. It's just fantastic.\n\nIf you are expecting a better game than Armageddon, don't get it. If you are willing to accept that this was the first game in the series and you can appreciate it for what it is, DEFINITELY get this game! You might want to hunt down the SNES version though since it is a lot better in my opinion since it already didn't have online play and it's pretty much the same game but with a controller instead of a mouse and keyboard which makes it a little bit easier to play once you get the controls down.","November 28, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Already familiar with its immediate (and infinitely more refined) sequels, Worms 2 and Armageddon, I was mostly unimpressed. I revisited it on Steam with the assumption that I’d half-heartedly play a game or two, exit to desktop and write up a review labelling it “Not Recommended,” partly because it’s been made obsolete by newer instalments and partly because it just wasn’t much fun to begin with.\n\nNot quite. Whether it’s because the Steam version is more enhanced than the Saturn port, or simply because of something I missed the first time round, I find that there’s much more entertainment to be had with the original Worms than I remembered. I expected a barely-functioning prototype to the classic Worms formula presented in Worms 2 and perfected in Worms Armageddon, but in reality it’s a solid turn-based strategy that holds up surprisingly well and, just as importantly, manages to retain its own unique flavour, distinct from any of the titles that followed it.\n\nFor a 20-year-old game running on a slightly shaky version of DosBox*, it looks and sounds fantastic. There’s a lot of detail in each themed environment, every inch of which can be destroyed by the usual high-impact weapons you’d expect to find in a Worms title. It’s an impressive achievement for 1995, and one that has obvious implications on gameplay. The worms themselves look a little worse, 8-bit sprites against a backdrop that appears to have evolved without them, yet there’s a certain something in their choppy animations that, in addition to slightly awkward but otherwise well-meaning FMV clips, lends to the overall light-hearted, cartoon feel of the game. That, and a wide variety of voice banks that see your team speaking in anything from hyperactive American to thick Norwegian.\n\nThe gameplay itself will be familiar to anyone who’s ever played a Worms game - take turns navigating purposefully cumbersome worms across a dangerous terrain, utilising increasingly dangerous weaponry to, you know, destroy all enemies - and in this original release it works remarkably well. Some gameplay tweaks from future instalments are missing here - once you begin to fire a bazooka, for instance, you cannot change its trajectory at the last minute. Inconsistencies in the A.I. are also present - at times, computer-controlled worms freeze for the duration of their turn; other times, they fire missiles and throw grenades with accuracy that guarantees a perfect hit. Worms has always been best enjoyed with other people, however, and that doesn’t change here.\n\nThis is not the best Worms game - in fact, it may well be the weakest of the original 2D titles. But as the precursor to one of the best (if a little tired) multiplayer series ever devised, it’s well worth giving a shot, no matter how familiar you are with other instalments. And if you can allow for its flaws, there’s a good chance you’ll find yourself sticking with the original Worms for more than one round.\n\n\n*There are some hoops to jump through in getting Worms to run on Windows 8.1, and probably a bunch of other operating systems. Fortunately the solution is mostly straightforward, and can be found in Steam's community hub.","December 2, 2015","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Yes, this version does just run on DosBox and yes you could just get a ROM running on it yourself as I did, but I never got the iconic music game/menu working by doing it myself.\n\nOn top of that, knowing that a small part of what I paid goes to Team17 for their original masterpiece was enough to convince me to spend the money on a version works with the click of a button rather than farting around with command line arguments.\n\nIf you love modern Worms, then get this game - it encompasses all that the Worms franchise was built upon and as a veteran Worms player I hope that the popularity of this version will help Team17 remember what a real Worms game is all about! Of couse I could say the same about Worms 2 - get that too if you can!
