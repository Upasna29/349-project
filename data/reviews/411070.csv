Nice controls and all though:)","November 24, 2015","true","2.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Using a keyboard I was easily able to manipulate the trickier levels.\nI've played a few hours at present and although I can't play it for too long - maybe 30 minutes at a time - I keep coming back for more and even though I wouldn't say I am an expert I'm improving my score over time.\n\nThe asthetic is very stylish and the color scheme and audio have been well worked out and clearly it's a labor of love with some fine attention to detail throughout. I certainly would recommend the game for those who want a challenge as clearly it isn't a game to play while you pat the dog.\n\nAltogether a finely crafted and well designed game way above the regular indie standard and at a reasonable price tag too.","December 11, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ultimately though I had to stop playing it because of the frustration factor.  Navigating through a complex level once is fine but making me traverse it multiple times with no checkpoints in between is just torture.","November 24, 2015","false","1.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","6","9","0","0"

Loved the sound design and music though. I'll pick up a gift copy at Christmas and give it to someone who loves a challenge.\n\nI guess I'll leave this here, cheers Chris,","December 5, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Will probably come back to it later but this is just too difficult.  I don't mind a challenge but this is pretty ridiculous.","December 6, 2015","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
