"http://steamcommunity.com/id/HitGod47/recommended/259890/","HitGod47","HitGod47","http://steamcommunity.com/id/HitGod47/","791 products in account","Wow, would you look at all the negative reviews. Does that scare you? It scared me.\n\nI probably wouldn't have bought the game either, but I got it in a bundle with some other farm simulators. Despite my reluctance I decided to give it a test drive one day and see what all the hate was about.\n\nTen hours later I came to a conclusion and can now tell you what I think about this unusual game.\n\nFirst of all, you have to be familiar with farming sims and understand how they are played. If you don't know how to operate the machinery then you are not going to have fun. That brings me to my second point: half of the reviews on here are from people who have absolutely no idea what to do and, instead of looking for help, they decided to nix the game altogether. The other half is from jokesters who jumped on the hate bandwagon because that is the popular thing to do nowdays.\n\nIf anyone with the least bit of interest in the subject would have taken the time to learn the game then I think they would have appreciated what the developers have almost succeeded in creating here. I say "almost" because I can admit that it is not a perfect game. Yes, it does have lots of bugs; and yes, it is slightly underdeveloped. But no way is it the unplayable disaster that the reviewers here would have you believe. I have played games far far worse than this one.\n\nIt helps to have some prior experience with farming, but the game itself is quite easy to learn. I have a rudimentary knowlege of the subject and still didn't know what to do. I found the tutorial videos from the main menu but they would not play. However, with a little bit of digging you can find the videos in the game's main folder and watch them from there. You can even read the subtitle files that accompanied the videos with insightful tips. Reading and watching those made the game so much more easier to understand and I have been having fun playing it ever since.\n\nMy gameplay experience so far has ranged from average to great. It is a small game without a lot of replayability; so I can't see myself spending any more than 25 - 30 hours on it. But I am enjoying the game for what it is. It's a farm sim set in an historical period; and it's not trying to be anything more than that. The sooner you can accept that the less disappointed you will be.\n\nMaybe I am a bit biased for having such a strong interest in antiquated farming. I've tried recreating the same time period on the more popular farming games without success. Their antique tractors were nice, but in the end all it is is modern farming using old machines. But this game is so much more detailed. You actually have to connect implements by hand and get off your tractor each time you want to lower the seeder for planting. And the plowing itself is the most real I've ever seen in a farm sim. Instead of having ready-made fields for you to plow, you have to decide where you want to grow and start digging up the green. I spent hours on my first day outlining a field in my backyard and plowing a sizable portion of the yard. After cultivating, fertilizing and planting I'm now waiting for my first crops to show.\n\nThis game also features the most animal interaction I've ever seen. You have to keep them stocked up on hay and grass. The bales can be stored in the barn loft and, just like any farmer, they must be thrown down to the bottom floor and placed in designated locations. Milk and eggs can also be collected and sold at the local market. Unfortunately the animals do not move much, but you can walk them to places you want them to be. You can also breed them for their offspring and sell your old animals. And make sure you don't scare the chickens too far away or they may die of starvation.\n\nThe machine models, I think, are some of the best-looking in a game like this. They all look beautiful and shiny and historically accurate. There are a few different tractors you can purchase, including a John Deere model; not sure how they were able to acquire that license. The implements are varied and also look good. Antique plows, cultivators, seeders, balers, wagons and more have been perfectly modeled. Even the harvester is one of the old ones that is pulled behind the tractor; something I haven't been able to find in any other game.\n\nI plan to spend more time on this game because I am actually enjoying it. However I do wish they would patch it with fixes and added incentives. There is a gas station in the game, but you never run out of gas. Was this a planned but cancelled feature? Also you can sell logs, but no way to chop down trees? That's disappointing when you realize that the game could have been so much better with a little bit more work. But, still, it is not a terrible game.\n\nSo far I have experienced no game-breaking bugs. There was an incident in which all of my animals disappeared, but I reloaded an older save and they returned. Some times the game does lock up when launching, but closing and relaunching usually helps. There are some minor physics issues, but the solution to that is don't do stupid stuff. This is not an FPS. Treat it with a little bit of delicacy. Why would you be doing silly stunts when you should be farming? The only real annoying thing that occured was when one of my pigs and dog became stuck and I couldn't move them. I drove the tractor through them and they returned to normal. Sometimes it's the simplest solutions that save the day.\n\nEven though I wish more work could have been done, I am still happy to have discovered this fascinating game. I would like others to enjoy it too, but I guess you can't please everyone.","February 18","true","9.8"," 37 of 39 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","37","39","2","5"

But there's a reason (beyond the thousands of dollars of investment) that I'm simulating the process, rather than doing it for real - I don't Actually want to sit on a tractor for hours plowing a field.\n\nI guess my complaint is that it's a little too real, and not enough "game." Working the farm is almost entirely tedious work, and by no means play. There's no gorgeous vistas to distract you from the tedium, no array of music - not even the country music one might playfully expect.\n\nIt's hard to learn the farming process, because you're spending such a vast amount of time doing the basic steps that it's easy to lose focus. Ways of skipping the tedium would be great - even if you could only "skip" a step by having the computer recreate your last attempt, down to the amount of hours, fuel, and total coverage you got. That way, you have to do it yourself, and you still get to do things in a remotely reasonable time - hours of tractoring, instead of days.","November 18, 2014","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You turn around and see your dog, running towards you. You see your chicken, your pigs... well and Bessy, the old cow. And then you see your old tractor and...\n\nNo, I am not kidding, this is actually what this game looks like, but take care, you have to finetune the graphics a lot, if you don't you are in for some bad surprises. The game is... difficult to describe, it has some charm, yet it lacks a lot of important features. Actually you are quite in a freestyle mode, but without a lot of realism. Well actually, the graphics look nice and crisp but the game itself, it's lacking - and the game even isn't that realistical.\n\nDriving around with your tractor will give you the first lesson, there is no mud in Historical Farming, the tractor looks like out of the showroom even after heavy duty farmwork... You can enter the barn, throw hay and stuff down... but, thats about all you might do. There is a tutorial, yes, it helps you to get the game straight... if you want to call it game. I prefer the category, "Glorified Walking Simulator"... Tuscany, Alps? Really? Well, at least that one the devs got right.\n\nPros:Nice Graphic, if you know how to tune it down.Nice Idea.Cons:Even the graphic is nice, you need to tune it down, otherwise even high end GAs might find the game hard to swallow.The game could have been so much more, with some missions to get a first feel - and give an alternative Freestyle mode additionally.Crashes regulary - I encountered during gameplay some crashes.Soundtrack, though not bad, also not quite fitting to the game.\nNot Recommended\nActually, though I do have some sympathies for the game and the devs, I really can't recommend the game. There is so much, that is left open to the wish of the customer, that it's really saddening. The game is a great idea, especially with the old models, but the realization is lacking. On a scale of 1 to 10 this game is a lowly four.","February 17","false","3.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Using vintage equipment, you can create your own workable farm. Agricultural Simulator: Historical Farming also allows you to Co-Op play with a friend, so you can work a farm together. The game basically plays the same way as Agricultural Simulator 2013, but without the newer equipment, which makes it more of a challenge. This particular game does not appear to have a playable tutorial the way Agricultural Simulator 2013 did, but there are places online where you can download a free demo, so I would recommend doing that before purchasing the game so you know exactly what you are getting into before you spend money.\n\nI think as a simulator, this game is no different then other Agricultural Simulators and would probably have been a better DLC to Agri Sim 2013, as opposed to a standalone. In any case, it's not a bad game and should present a decent challenge to fan's of the Agricultural Simulator games.","July 24, 2015","true","0.2"," 9 of 22 people (41%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","41","9","22","2","2"

With the new feature – the dynamic ground Agrar Simulator – Historical Farming presents the first real furrows which will be left when working at the fields with strong machines. The furrows will have impact on the driving behavior of the tractors and guarantee pure realism. It is up to the player to decide in which region he would like to cultivate his farm.
