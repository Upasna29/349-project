I did do some reading on the wiki/forums and what not, and still had a bit of trouble. But I've figured it out! This game doesn't leave much room for mistakes, thus while being a puzzly explory type game, it's easy to waste too much time trying to figure things out before the endless winter rolls around to ruin your plans. There are certain items you need to progress that just aren't available in winter, so unless you've already got them you're kind of screwed. There are a lot of elements that can be bothersome if you don't have the tools to make things easier for yourself. And of course when you're just starting out playing you dont know how to properly manage things so that you easily survive.\n\nSo basically you will be playing through it a few times to figure things out before being successful. I liked it in that I found it challenging and wanted to get to the end. I also liked the art/design/sound all that stuff was nice.\n\nIf there's any advice I can give that really helped me it's this, do all the upgrades in one alter before moving on the the next one, and experiment with what can be offered to try and save food. That's all I'll say for now but if you need any tips/questions ask me or ask in the discussion forums and you'll usually get an answer.\n\nAlso I have many hours clocked in as I found it more convenient to leave the game paused rather than bother journeying to the save point. Just my own laziness really, saving isn't that much of an ordeal.","December 16, 2014","true","42.5"," 47 of 49 people (96%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","96","47","49","5","0"

I was ready to quickly label it as one of the many wannabe-artsy games that focus on a (sometimes cryptic) story and have little-to-no thought about the actual gameplay, a genre that has become so popular lately, but even though it's a little pretentious in its use of words, it is definitely way more than that.\n\nSurviving is, in fact, not so easy at all, you'll have to plan your day carefully and act accordingly (and hope nothing else distracts you along the way).\nI especially liked the twist on the map exploration and crafting mechanics, you only have a limited number of slots to "remember" places or tools you found and you have to decide what to keep in order to help your survival.\n\nWhat else can I say? It also has an honest price, in my opinion, for what it offers, so it can be a nice little addition to the library.","June 12, 2014","true","7.0"," 49 of 55 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","49","55","0","0"

Cursing your tools for breaking just before felling a tree, finding out that you don't have enough wood to keep your tootsies warm all night..\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple, you're gathering for most of the game with your hands or with the relentlessly degrading tools you can make. The rewards of your survival are even more tools to help you survive longer, so it can be hard to feel like you're really getting anywhere until you manage to get your 10th character to actually make it through the harsh winter. Then it's time to prepare for the next winter.\n\nThe game was recently updated with difficulty levels. This was done in response to community complaints about the time you spend just trying to survive presenting too large an obstacle in regards to progressing with the story. There's now the option for a "casual" mode, which will surely make things a little easier and less frustrating for those of us who make mistakes or are just generally unlucky.","June 13, 2014","true","7.6"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","30","34","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jessfest/recommended/305780/","jessfest","utopianmachine","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jessfest/","792 products in account","I wanted very much to like Echo of the Wilds. You can expect to die more than once, it seems, as you figure out the ropes of the game. Unfortunately, it's too random to promote your survival, so that you will likely quit in frustration.\n\nAs you explore, the game allows you to remember the locations you find, but only so many of them at once. You have 9 location slots, and if they are all full and you find a new, awesome location, you can't remember it and, therefore, can't come back. You can delete locations you've seen before, but it's a balancing act against the randomness of the game and the questionable usefulness of places you discover. You can also get recipes for crafting items by sacrificing food to an altar, but you may not get recipes that fit your level of progress so far. You'll start with a hammer recipe, a digger, an axe -- but it's very possible that you'll get a recipe to snare a rabbit but have no way to skin it and harvest its resources. So you just have to keep giving food to the altar, getting other recipes that do you no good (or none at all, for reasons I don't understand and are not explained), and just hope to get the recipe you need at that moment.\n\nNot to mention, the game is on a schedule. As you're trying to gather resources and find a way to a mystical place where all your questions will be answered (and, I assume, the game ends), you're fighting time and the coming of the seasons. In Fall, there is very little food, so that you could easily starve fast. In winter, however, if you've even managed to survive to then, there is virtually no food. Oh, not to mention, it's freezing. Unless you have managed to craft the variety of items you need to survive the cold, you die in about a day.\n\nI played two play-throughs in about 5 hours, and I don't intend to play it again. Even if I managed to find ideal locations and the resources and recipes I needed in the right order, I would be flying through the game, trying to stretch every day to it's limits before nightfall, all to craft the items I would need to survive the deadly winter, just so I could continue to simply PLAY the game.","December 13, 2014","false","5.8"," 52 of 72 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","52","72","0","4"

The goal is to survive long enough to unravel the mystery of the Wilds. It requires good time and resource management skills and the puzzles are challenging enough to warrant busting out pen and paper. High replay value if you are the type of person who likes to beat your own score. I've logged nearly 120 hrs on this game and have only completed it twice.

The pacing feels like old school PC games (Myst, Sierra's catalog): low-stress and highly enjoyable. And not to worry, the love-it-or-loathe-it twee dialog fades into the background after awhile.\n\nGreat for anyone who loves nature, personal challenges, and/or the unconventional.

Anyway ...\n\nI want to like this game so badly! But I don't!\n\nIt's so pretty, the music is nice, and the gameplay is weird and different.\n\nIt has all of the elements of being good! But isn't!\n\nWhat it really boils down to is ... It's stressful.\n\nEach day's goal is to: Find enough food to stay alive, and enough firewood to keep a fire going all night.\n\nSounds easy, right? Wrong.\n\nThe days are SO SHORT. THEY ARE SO SHORT!!! And each one is a crapshoot with an unfair weight on luck.\n\n99% of days after the first 3-5, you will be barely keeping your health at 10-20% while scrabbling together enough twigs to keep a fire going that will burn out halfway through the night.\n\nThen, if you manage to wake up, it's raining, and you waste the entire day trying to find a new location with even ONE berry or ANYTHING of use (and find nothing).\n\nYou can't make ANYTHING without recipes. You can't get recipes without food. You can't do ANYTHING, any TINY thing, without cutting into your stamina, and food's the only thing to bring that back. And 25% of the ♥♥♥♥ you find poisons you! Is it hot? Less stamina. Is it cold? Less stamina. Is the wind sort of blowing? Less stamina.\n\nThe main character has:\n\nthe most aggressive diabetes ever experienced (people can live like a month without food you know!),\na severe head wound (if you learn more than 12 things, you have to overwrite memories!!!!),\nthe least creativity of any human in humankind (apparently even snapping twigs off trees by hand is beyond their scope),\nthe stamina of an obese geriatric patient with mono,\nless personal item management ability than the memeguy who couldn't hold all those limes,\nand the slowest legs to ever both exist and still be ambulatory.\nIf you do ANYTHING it takes a HUGE chunk of the day. Even if that thing was a mistake, or if there's nothing there to find. There are some days where you can literally try hard to survive, but find NOTHING useful, and do NOTHING to save yourself.\n\nHonestly this is Dreamlike Death Simulator 2015.\n\nI got so frustrated, so convinced I suck, that I tried to watch playthroughs to get an idea of what I'm doing wrong. I can't find a complete one! Everyone gives up!!! WTH?\n\nIn the story, part of the thing is that you're trying to do something which has been tried a million times, and every time, the character died trying. Which I believe. Because this ♥♥♥♥ is only for the coolest cucumber with the most luck in the world and the most time/patience to do whole chunks of time over and over and over to get it right.\n\nIf you die 3x, it's game over, and you start over. So all you want to do is reload. But you can barely ever save because food is so scarce.\n\nHonestly this game would have been TOTALLY AWESOME for me, if they had ONLY had a mode where it saves every night, so if I ♥♥♥♥ up a day, I can try over. And the mode is optional, so the people with tons of time on their hands can do it the hard way.\n\nI realize games from my youth were like this -- game over meaning you start all over -- but I'm too old for that ♥♥♥♥ now, and it really shouldn't exist as anything but an option for the hardcore in the era of computer games with disk space to save ♥♥♥♥ to.\n\nSO, this game will be awesome for you, if you like to whittle away many hours fighting the VERY UNFORGIVING clock to advance, only to be sent back to start if you're unlucky or make mistakes.\n\nIf you don't like that sort of thing, look elsewhere.\n\nWhich is a shame, again, because it really DOES have all the trappings of what makes indie games great.","May 13, 2015","false","2.5"," 20 of 28 people (71%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","71","20","28","16","2"

Admittedly, I was a little turned off in my initial playthrough, however, after giving it another chance, I quickly dove into a refreshing, novel experience.\n\nIf you like survival/crafting-based gameplay, psychedelic-lite aesthetics, and an introspective storyline, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are good - the detail in the environments and character models is well-done; the more psychedelic scenes are also great (and may take you aback if you haven't seen any screenshots). The ambient noises and sounds are good - in particular, I appreciate the change in tone whenever the vibe of the scene transforms (usually into a dream-like sequence). The story is very nice, and anyone who enjoys introspection and philosophical thinking should be satisfied with the game's message - I personally felt that the game was in no way pretentious or overly-aggressive in portraying said message(s).\n\nI have a problem with the controls, and I think the main culprit is the poor optimization between controller and keyboard - when you edit the keybindings, it will only allow you to do this for the keyboard. Using a keyboard is okay - and perhaps even recommended - however, the controls are very counter-intuitive if you are used to playing videogames and choose to use a controller. I have played a lot of game throughout my life, and Western norm is for the right button (circle/B) to be the exit/cancel key, while the top button (triangle/Y) performs that action in many Japanese-based games. In Echo, the default gamepad controls are (in inventory management): x/A -> drop; circle/B -> Use; square/X -> exit. It takes a bit of getting used to, as I would constantly be dropping/using my items when I didn't intend to. The game makes an attempt to be ergonomic- the A, S, and D default keys are green, red, and blue in-game - however, when you rebind the keys, you will still see the letters A, S, and D inside the in-game keys (you can turn the key hints off to prevent confusion). A suggestion - having the three command keys spread out in the actual layout on a controller (if key hints are enabled)will take up space in-game, but will be much more ergonomic.\n\nThe controls will take a bit of getting used to, but the tutorial mini-mode will be extremely helpful in getting you familiarized with the gameplay. The learning curve is minimal to moderate depending on your experience with survival games - I will caution, however, that this game can be unforgiving if you do not plan your days in advance. Do not be surprised if you die during your first few playthroughs - once you understand what to prioritize and how (ex: "forgetting" initially useless areas), your games will last considerably longer.\n\nGameplay consist of you trying to survive each day/night while trying to progress the storyline. You usually have enough time to scout 2 new places on the map, however, you can only "remember" one area per day. Remembering a location will allow you to revisit it from then on. I recommend you do not remember places with one-time spawns (ex: an area with a LOT of fruit bushes), as only certain things respawn over time (like trees and shoots). You can also "forget" areas to clear up space on the map. If night time arrives, you will be unable to interact with any objects in the environment unless you have a torch. Your two main priorities are to secure a food/drink source (starving will decrease health over time) and a fire source (you will lose health if you sleep without an adequate fire).\n\nDuring your journey, you will be treated to story elements that add a lot of interesting scenes. There will also be special structures that allow you to donate food in order to receive crafting recipes (extremely useful). Saving is fairly unique, and also requires a food donation. Note, you must locate these special structures first. Death offers you the slightest chance to continue, but you should never gamble on this chance (instead, focus on not dying). The goal of the game is to  return home after some life revelations/insights . Endless mode has been taken out by the developer, which is something that I miss (although a new game+ is in the making).\n\nOverall, Echo is a great game for any survival/crafting enthusiasts, and this game should definitely be given a try if you are interested in the genre.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews\n\n","February 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","16","21","4","0"

The game has a great storyline, with a variety of areas you can explore. It has an extensive crafting system, which makes this game quite unique having a style, you usually would not expect to accompany a survival game. The learning and crafting mechanics were easy to learn and overall not too hard. The tutorial at the start of the game was informative, though not boring and helped understand the simple, yet difficult controls. Once you learnt the controls, it was fairly simple and easy from there. The game had an inbuilt stamina system, which wasn't too demanding and complemented the game quite well. Echo of the Wilds is difficult in some aspects, some parts were confusing at times, though it clears up throughout the game. I particularly disliked that to access the options menu, you had to exit the world and enter the main menu, just to edit sounds, binds, etc. Also, not sure if it was just me, though I had my sound full volume, and had it on in the options, though couldn't hear any sounds?\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nPositives:☆Unique.\n☆Extensive crafting system.\n☆Great storyline.\n☆Nice stamina system.\n☆Informative tutorial.\n☆Nice concept.\n\nNegatives:☆Option menu only accessible via main menu.\n☆Sound was hard to hear.\n☆Kind of confusing at times.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════\nSummary:Overall, the game was very unique and a very worthy and amazing indie game which was a blast. The crafting system was amazing, the game mechanics, the exploration and even the stamina bar wasn't demanding. I particularly enjoyed this game and it is spectacular for an indie dev to create something so thought out and original.

You require food and water and need some wood to burn each night as you sleep otherwise you lose stamina and potentially become ill. The way you get food changes with the seasons which makes things interesting, as one day you can rely on catching rabbits, but then the next day you'll have to build a fishing rod to fish.\n\nOnce you learn the little tricks basic survival becomes trivial which in this case is a good thing because there are plenty of other things you'll need to do to complete the game. First you need to find the knowledge and supplies to craft tools, clothes and camp upgrades. Then there are certain areas that involve puzzles which at times have you exploring around areas for solutions or specific items needed to complete the puzzle.\n\nThe game can feel very over-whelming, but that's simply down to the fact you have a high degree of freedom to play through the game how you want. However, much of the game is based on using your time and collecting the right items from the right areas. I feel the game would be immesarbly improved if for example there are fun minigames or the actual act of hunting for rabbits and fish were more of a minigame themselves. Like other survival games there is a danger of the act of surviving feeling more like a chore, which I hope is addressed in future updates.\n\nThere is a high degree of randomness to the areas you find and each of the puzzles themselves have random elements. This spices up the gameplay well and keeps things fresh each time you play the game to learn more about it.\n\nStoryThe story is told through the many dreams and narrative scenes. It can be quite cryptic at times so you need to really think about what's happening. It's quite profound at times but ultimately I felt it a bit lacking as there simply wasn't enough narrative scenes over the course of the game. There are also special areas where you meet ghosts of people which I enjoyed, but again I would appreciate there being more to make the world really come to life and feel as vibrant as the graphics.\n\nGraphics and MusicThis along with the gameplay is where it really shines. The graphics are beautiful, combining retro art with modern visual effects. The environments are very varied, from grasslands to lush jungles to dark bottomless cave systems. The music is so calming and perfectly compliments the environmental sounds of birds cheeping, waves crashing, etc. If you like pixel art then this game is faultless.","February 20","true","14.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

However, the survival and adventure aspects of this game are very much at odds with each other. You spend way too much time looking at loadscreens for the amount of gameplay in any given area. Imagine playing an old adventure game like King's Quest, except with annoying and unnecessary visuals while transitioning between areas. Now make those areas about 1/10th the size of a traditional adventure game. I suppose what I'm getting at is the pacing, it is terrible. The process of giving food to find recipes is also boring. In fact, a lot of the survival aspects are just poorly shoehorned into the game.\n\nI like the general concept and I hope the developer attempts to improve upon it.","July 26, 2014","false","16.4"," 38 of 64 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","38","64","0","2"

As a warning, I never finished the game (due to reasons below).\n\nDays are split up into 4 time-sections and you choose where to explore each day until you run out of time. Any action that goes into the 4th time section will be limited as night approaches and the darkness stops your ability to interact with the environment (without a torch). One of the most important things you need to learn is that returning to camp costs no time so you need to drop off everything unnecessary in between areas (because inventory space is pretty limited).\n\nYour only basic necessities are managing your hunger/thirst meters and gathering enough wood for the night's fire. Your goals beyond that are to tribute food/precious materials at the altars for more recipes, explore different areas, and learn more about the world's mechanics to survive into later seasons.\n\nPersonally, I would've liked a casual mode where you could save freely. It might go against the experience that the dev intended, but that experience isn't the kind I enjoy. Saving always seems like a waste of precious time because it takes up a quarter of the day and an offering. I think I read that the dev could 100% it before the end of summer (although he has added more things since then) so maybe time isn't an issue to someone who has mastered the game. However, that's not something you'd normally know and I've been a hoarder of rare consumables in RPGs and wasting a quarter of a day to save often is something I don't want to do.\n\nMy game locked up when I accidentally used reeds on a reed patch (no buttons responded except for the menu to quit the game) and I lost several in-game days of progress. On a x360 controller 'use' is mapped to B and 'cancel' is mapped to X (which was the opposite of what I'm used to) so that happened several times. Other than that, I didn't see any other bugs.\n\nHowever, you might like that challenging/hardcore feel of needing to go through many playthroughs in order to learn, understand and get a little further in the game next time. This is a game that you need to get deeply invested in to do well at because there are a lot of little things you have to deal with.","June 17, 2015","true","4.3"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

The interface isn't overly cumbersome like most survival games out on the market. You must choose when to seek crafting recipes and slowly make room for new items as you hit crafting milestones. Crafting is both rewarding and fun. You'll find that searching for the right materials is more like a scavenger hunt than a chore, though you will need to grind wood and food.\n\nInventory management left me frustrated, yet adequately challenged. Having only six slots available in the beginning is the biggest challenge for me. Fumbling your items around the camp in clustered piles is a necessity, since the craftable camp-storage upgrade limits you to two small chests (10 slots per chest).\n\nAs you discover more about the game's "secret economy", you will find equipment that becomes hard-locked to your person, meaning it cannot be dropped. It is crucial that you craft the Palm Sack or you will eventually become too encumbered to continue. In my 2nd playthrough, I made it past day 40, with two hard-locked items and no Palm Sack, which meant 4 free spaces available at any given time. As a result, I met my demise, since I wasn't able to collect enough wood to keep from freezing at night.\n\nThe story so far has been very engaging, slightly creepy, and somewhat obscure. Overall it works in harmony with the gameplay and art design. The game doesn't rush you in the beginning, giving you ample time to wander around and discover things. However, you should work fast because as the season change, food becomes more scarce. If you are unprepared for Autumn, you may find yourself in a bad way.\n\nThe graphics are simplistic, yet beautiful. The pixelated sprites have just enough definition to be recognizable as their real-world counterparts. The art design is incredible all around, especially in the dreamlike sequences.\n\nHaving just binged two playthroughs in a 10 hours timespan, I would highly recommend this game to anyone interested in a semi-casual survival game without the typical gameplay tropes that plague the genre. Yes, there is thirst, hunger, and a day-night cycle. However, these elements serve the game well and do not detract from the enjoyment of the journey.\n\nI give Echo of the Wilds a 10/10 because it easily outshines other survival games in my library, of which I have many.","March 2","true","14.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I tried to play it a year ago or so and bounced off it the first time around, so I'll say I think you need to be in the right mood for it.

Stay alive and discover the world around you. Use the beginners guide if you need to in the community hub, but also just enjoy the exploration and prepare to die and try again! Now with more whimsey!\n\nOn a seperate note, if you go to the discussions area, you'll see that the developer has personally responded to the majority of the posts with guidance and advice or even with gratitude for bringing a bug/imbalance to light (and then with actual statements that the problem has been fixed!).

I don't even know if I would recommend you buy this. But, if it's on sale, you may as well, because it will give you... an experience. I'll also go ahead and include my final  sentences down below in this paragraph. "Will I ever play again? I don't know. Maybe one night I'll go back to it. This time I'll be sure to always collect an abundance of firewood (which by the way isn't easy to get in high stock). I never want to experience that nightmare again."\n\nThis next story is really just an experience that I had, not a review of the game. This may be a spoiler, I have no idea. You've been warned.\n\nSo the first few nights I slept through I did not get enough wood for a fire to last the whole night. All this seemed to cause was a dream (actually a nightmare), so I thought it wasn't a big deal. What could happen?  A wild animal that I could either kill or run away from? No. These dreams started to get worse, and quickly turned into nightmares that would probably leave real life me awake quaking in bed if I had had them  (I am a 17 year old male). First there were deers... Then there were deer satan. Then Satan.\nThen I was finally given a dream that I could manipulate. I was thrown face to face with Deer Satan himself, and had to run for my life towards a light. At first I did not realize this, so he got AWEFULLY close to me, and the whole run was terrifying. But I escaped. Then continued on with my business. I decided that today would be a good time to start stock piling wood. I never wanted that event to happen to me ever again. I was walking passed a tree when suddenly Deer Satan embodied behind me out of sight, and proceeded to chase me. Again. All I had to do to escape this was run away for a short time, and he dissapeared. No big deal? Normally things like these progress somewhat slowly in games. It would either happen again a long time from now with increasing frequency every time I missed a night, or it would stop all together until another bad dream. I was wrong. I was so wrong. I had calmed down just in time for Dear Satan to appear in front of me again about fifteen seconds later, this time in broad daylight. Oh, also he was faster. It was so terrifying I immediately closed the game. This Indie survival game that had no "Horror" tag was so scary I quit on the spot. So yeah, that was my experience. Will I ever play again? I don't know. Maybe one night I'll go back to it. This time I'll be sure to always collect an abundance of firewood (which by the way isn't easy to get in high stock).

What else is new, right? WRONG. In Echo of the Wilds not only are you totally confused, excited and totally lost about what's happening, but you just want to keep going, you'll also work, HARD, for your bizarely-shaped character to stay alive through the night.\n\nIt's actually easy to understand, you'll know exactly where the needed items are to eat, drink, antidotes and such. But your daily limited time is going to make you choose, and believe me when I say your decisions matter. You could very easily die since it was too dark already to collect some wood because you just HAD to craft yourself that damn axe you wanted to use TO GET WOOD IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!...\n\nI mean... Yeah, sometimes it's about getting through the night in one piece with as much health as possible, priviledges like storage or a hammer can wait... I don't know, 10 days? Even more?\n\nAnd just so you know. You have limited inventory to 5 items, and since cutting down a three or getting stone takes 2-3 usable items to get, that means you have 2 to use freely, sometimes. Places? There are a few, but you can only memorize 15 of them meaning you'll have to decide which ones you want to leave to luck to stumble upon.\n\nDon't get me wrong, though. It's hard in a very good way, it devours you. Nothing else matters for hours but this game, day after day, allucination after allucination.\n\nOh, did I mention the Save feature requires you to offer food? Yes, you're trying to survive and since you are about to die you'd want to save the game, just in case, right? Sure, just bring some food you don't have to Save a game you're going to lose anyway!...\n\nIn a few words. This is the most interesting, punishing and relaxing/rage inducing survival game you'll ever play, and it's worth every minute of your time even if it gets you NOWHERE!\n\nI like the game, but there should be an Easy mode somewhere.

When you finally "earn" a recipe, the one you get is completely random. I'm about 20 game days in and have unlocked 9 recipes, all of which turned out to be utterly useless. (A scroll rack?

You can't quit until the developer decides it's time for you to quit, otherwise you lose all your progress.

I bought it via another distributor a long time back so do not take my "steam time" into consideration.

Time in the day to do stuff also feels limiting. But while I find these limitations frustrating, it's these very things that make the game so darn challenging. It's not meant to be quickly played through once and forgotten. Rather - this is a game where you will likely die often. But each time you'll learn a bit more about yourself, these woods and the odd story that unfolds as you try to survive in the trippy wilds. I'm not a "HUGE" fan of modern pixel art games, however the implementation of such in this game is nothing short of beautiful. The abstract graphics somehow add to, rather than take from - the overall trippy atmosphere of the game/experience. I have yet to beat it. I doubt I've even come close. But I will keep coming back to these woods to discover how to survive them and eventualy get out of them.

The days are not long enough, and doing one thing takes too much of your day.

I haven't played a whole lot but I found what I did play interesting and I'm sure I'll revisit it at some point to see if I can get further.\n\nThe controls are not great and rebinding is funky, tooltips are hard coded to show default controls. There's no mouse control which would be nice to have, but you don't miss it terribly during play. I like the aesthetic, it has competent pixel art and has obviously had a lot of heart and imagination poured into it. Environments are colourful and varied.\n\nThe thing I liked most was game mechanics tied into gameplay rather than a HUD, there's no hearts in the corner to denote how many lives you have left for example, instead you have to try and escape a dark figure who runs after you a bit faster each time you die. The story is trippy and written in a very weird fashion, it was compelling enough to make me want to finish it at some point.\n\nThe lack of an in-depth tutorial or any explanation of survival mechanics could be a black mark, but I think it might be necessary for the game's structure, it seems intentional to make you feel stranded. Some things are explained, some aren't.\n\nAll in all, it's a tentative recommendation from me, it's interesting but far from perfect.","October 25, 2014","true","0.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The days are incredibly short! (this will be the focus of my review)\n\nThe gameplay of Echo of the Wilds involves you exploring, crafting, and surviving, but you won't be able to do much because of length of the days. You're walking around in this small meadow and picking up berries and plants, after a very short while it's suddenly nighttime! You're trying to cut down a small tree with your primitive saw and BAM it's nighttime!\n\nWhat's so bad about nighttime, you ask? Well, you can no longer inspect your environment unless you have a torch. You can still hang around your current area and try to do things, but you can no longer attempt to travel to other areas besides your camping site. No more exploring for you! Naturally, you wouldn't be able to do those things during the night, but it comes so swiftly that it really stops you from doing very much during the day.\n\nI'm not even going to talk about much of the other aspects of the game, because this pretty much ruins it for me. I would have loved it if not for the very short days.\n\n\nCONCLUSION: MAYBE GIVE IT A TRY, BUT I WOULDN'T RECOMMEND IT","February 8, 2015","false","3.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","7"

You are being nudged in which direction to explore by this ghost showing up at times, and by dream sequences and oddities you discover in the game world. The game is very much about figuring out what's going on. This part is enjoyable, but there is another part to the game as well. True to indie studios this title couldn't escape the survival aspect. Surviving means gathering food and logwood for a campfire to not starve to death, and regularly drinking water from streams. Ok, so what's so bad about that? Well, a number of things.\n\nTo get food you need to find a place with food. To get wood you need to chop down trees, either with an axe you have to learn a schematic for, or by using a saw-like branch from a specific type of bush. Chopping or sawing drains your food meter. To find these bushes, these trees, the food crops, and the place where you get schematics, you need to explore. When you explore you are never guaranteed to find the place you are looking for, and you can only remember twelve (or is it nine?) areas, true to the amnesia of your ingame avatar. Traveling takes time. You can only expect to visit two to three areas in one day, and when night comes, you better have wood ready for the fire, or sleeping in the cold will drain a lot of your food/health meter.\n\nTo eat food you have to, at least in the early game, travel to one of very few areas with berries and mushrooms. Sometimes the bushes carry plenty of berries, sometimes not. This is as far as I can tell completely random. Keep in mind that just traveling there takes up half a day, and you also need wood for your fire. There are ways to get food in other ways, but they require you to get crafting schematics from a shrine. Traveling to the shrine takes time, and you need to donate food or something else (won't spoil it) to get a schematic. You never know what schematic you get, or how many there are in total, but you can only remember twelve (or nine, can't remember) at a time. Starting to see a pattern here? None of this has to do with advancing the story.\n\nYou can of course, also only carry with you six or so items at any given time, be they tools like axes, or food, or logwood.\nThe problem here should start to be obvious: You are forced to backtrack a lot just to stay alive. There are schematics to make things easier, but getting there feels like a grind, and the sheer timesink aspect of this game really detracts from the fun part of exploring and discovering secrets. In between running around gathering wood and food, hoping you get the right schematic, hoping you find the right zone, and cursing your six item inventory and 2 minute day cycle, it really seemed like the developer thought the "amnesia-mechanic" was a fun new idea that he wanted to force to work, no matter how clunky it really is in practice.\n\nIt begs the question of why this is in the game at all. I heard it was a lot harder to survive in earlier patches, but right now it isn't hard, it's time consuming. I don't like it when games waste my time. I hate it when games waste my time, for no appearent reason to boot. Was this kept in the game because of the "survival" tag that is mandatory it seems for indie games these days? Was it because the developer was afraid that the game would be too short otherwise?\n\nI'm going to keep playing this game for a bit longer, because I spent money on it and I really do hope that it gets better, but I can't get past how impractical this system really is and how I do not understand the purpose of it beyond an attempt to set itself apart from other games.\n\nIf you are okay with timesinks, and you like mysterious exploration games, you should check it out. Otherwise, don't bother.","June 5","false","3.4"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","6"

It has been substantially improved, however, the pacing is still incredibly slow with little to no plot to catch my interest.\n\nThe 4 ingame days I played were spent:\n-Eating berries or mushrooms from bushes (Stand next to bush, push A, wait a few seconds)\n-Cutting down trees (select the saw, push A, wait until it breaks, then select another one....until the tree gets cut).\n-Walking\n\n\n\nIf you are a fan of adventure games, you will probably enjoy this game (would recommend).\n\nFor most other users, there are simply so many choices out there that this one would probably be a skip (especially at a price point of $9). Maybe if the game was priced closer to $3, I could recommend it.\n\nAlthough I am still not a fan of the visuals, it is perhaps personaly preference and my previous complaints have been mostly fixed.
