This one was different, though. Rather than an ambitious, procedurally generated, modernized spiritual successor to Bullfrog Productions’ Magic Carpet, this one was a simple platformer, also procedurally generated, with mouse-controlled shooting.\n\nUpon entering the game, I was met with a simple title screen featuring a simplistic logo, the version number and options to play or quit. Nothing more, nothing less, and no option to save. The press page did mention that it was roguelike in nature but I had assumed there might be more to it. Options of any kind and a proper pause menu were also on the list of missing basic features. If you wanted to pause the game, you would have to clumsily press buttons until you found F2, which pauses the game but does not provide a menu or a way to duck out of your current run.\n\nTurns out I would miss the pause menu and saving more than I realized. See, the first thing I noticed upon beginning to play LEVEL UP! was just how easy it is currently. So long as you never trap yourself in a one-block-high tunnel with enemies that shoot, you will never be at a point where there is a lot of risk to getting hit. Enemy shots are spaced out enough so that you will never be at risk of being shot if you jump over them. Unless there are multiple enemies in a confined space, they aren’t even a threat, being killed in a single shot, up against your rapid fire weapon that tears through walls.\n\nEven more problematic than that is the way the enemies are distributed across the map. There have been multiple times I’ve been in one-block-high tunnels with a group of multiple enemies that all shoot vertically. Frankly, this should not be happening. I generally expect, even in procedurally generated games, that the enemies in a specific area will be a legitimate threat in that area. It would be the same as putting a fire monster at the bottom of the ocean. That’s great. It would be threatening somewhere else. But here? Not really.\n\nThis probably comes from the fact that the core set of enemies is tiny. At present, there are maybe four different enemies, each similar stylistically, barely differing other than the fact that they shoot in different directions. Maybe one doesn’t fly. A single enemy type doesn’t shoot at all. No matter, as they all die in one hit and shoot so incredibly slowly, even in large groups, that they don’t pose much of a threat. Perhaps variation in those matters is more key than variation in movement and shot direction. Multiple weapons firing in the same direction, more health, and varying shot patterns would help immensely in this regard.\n\nUnfortunately, the lack of variation doesn’t end there. It’s pretty clear that the game is procedurally generated in a Spelunky-like manner, building levels from various pieces. There’s a problem with it in this game, though. In this game, The levels extend much further horizontally than they do vertically. In going with this limitation, it seems as if the pieces extend the entire height of the map, meaning that the pieces are only assembled along the horizontal axis. This makes it painfully clear when you’ve already been through that piece of the map – especially in the fully robotic, indestructible areas where I came across a mere three variations in the time I had played.\n\nDue to this lack of variation, the game becomes incredibly easy to predict after a short time. It won’t take long until you know where to sit to shoot through the walls and kill enemies without fear of being hit or how to jump up and down between shots to shoot at an enemy that is firing in your direction from off-screen. If you do even halfway decent at the game, you will reach a point where you have almost the entire top of the screen by the third or fourth level. The upgrades between levels don’t do much to help, either. While the upgrade dedicated to increasing the amount at which your gun tears through walls caps off pretty early, the health upgrade doesn’t ever seem to cap out and none of the upgrades scale in cost, making it easy to buy much more than is probably necessary before you’ve even reached the fifth level.\n\nTo iterate clearly, there isn’t anything that’s inherently bad about LEVEL UP! It works, it has a solid art style, complete with shifty shadows and scanlines, and the basic gameplay is solid, being heavily based in tried and true methods. It just isn’t there yet. There’s not enough variation in content, the game is easy, and the enemies don’t really put up much of a fight. Perhaps it could get there one day but, as of right now, it seems more like a proof of concept than anything.","November 24, 2014","false","1.9"," 51 of 74 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","51","74","0","1"

Apparently, I have to agree with Mattchu, it REALLY needs a lot of improvements, like a pause screen, make a strict limit of lives you can carry (as I have collected so many I saw half a heart! xD), music sometimes change its volume, needs more options on the main menu, and a whole lot more bits and pieces to find that needs fixing if you guys or I can discover them for ourselves. This game was quite fun, but unfortunately I have to not recommend this game until there is further notice of updates of the game itself.","November 28, 2014","false","3.2"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"
