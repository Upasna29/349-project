In Monkey Island 2 SE, you will have more of everything! More islands to explore, more bizarro characters, whacky plots & harder puzzles! I still remember all those years ago getting this on 11 floppy disks back on the Amiga & how much longer it took to complete than the original just a year or so before!\n\nGuybrush Threepwood returns, still regurgitating the story (to those that will listen) of how he vanquished LeChuck. This is old news now, so Guybrush sets out for more fame & fortune to a new island, and a new adventure .. the hunt for the Big Whoop treasure! Our dimwitted hero also will come across many of the memorable characters from the first game, but as as you can guess, his luck takes a turn for the worse pretty quickly.\n\nI won't say much more on the story other than to point out it is most enjoyable with some great dialog & some truly funny moments. Although one thing I didn't like so much compared to Monkey Island 1 was the ending. I thought it was clever when I first saw it all those years ago as a kid, but now it seems not to fit the game very well .. don't let that disuade you from trying it though as its still a great adventure (and besides, you might like it!).\n\nFast forward about 25 years to the Special Edition re-make; no more floppy disks to swap out & improved graphics/sound/interface, plus a 'modern gamer' friendly hints (& highlighting) system to point you in the right direction when you get stuck. Certainly the help system can take the frustration out, but something I would recommend avoiding to really get the most satisfaction out of the game experience. Progress should be earned & figuring it out yourself is so much more rewarding!\n\nAnother timeless point 'n' click adventure! One of the best from the era!\n\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review, please follow True Blue Reviews for more recommendations!","July 14, 2014","true","14.3"," 43 of 44 people (98%) found this review helpful","98","43","44","0","0"

It does add voice acting which is a pretty nice bonus to the experience. If you love these kinds of games just get it.\n\nThe game has mostly story achievements but has three missable achievements and one "speedrun" that you need to keep in mind.

They stocked games for all kinds of platforms, including the Amiga. I had an Amiga 500 at the time with an external disk drive and was going to purchase a brand, new game. On the shelf it was, Monkey Island 2, and I just had to have it. I took it home and was amazed at the vast amount of floppies. 11 disks I believe it was! The game itself was a blast, even though I nearly developed "disk swappers wrist" from taking floppies in and out of the drives all the time. Anyway, Monkey Island 2 became one of my most dearest games and I still have it on the shelf in the office.\n\nNow for the Special Edition. I tried it, instantly loved it, and I will come back to it in the future when I fancy some MI2 adventuring again. This version is just like the old classic, just better in all aspects. And you don't have to swap floppies all the time, as well as waiting for scenes to load. Everything is quick and beatiful.\n\nIf you've never tried Monkey Island 2 before, you really should.

Now, more mature, as his beard clearly indicates (even though some bartender doesn’t believe him), Guybrush feels unfulfilled as life has been in a rut since LeChuck’s demise. In search of a new adventure, he ventures off to find the buried treasure Big Whoop, in doing so, he accidentally initiates the events that lead to LeChuck’s resurrection.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=649379947\n\nAbout the Game\nMonkey Island 2: LeChuck’s Revenge was the first PC titles I’ve ever played when my brother borrowed it from one of his friends, and later on became to be the first PC game I’ve ever owned myself. It sparked the fascination for the adventure game genre and I own both the DRM-free retail version of the game, as well as a subscription to this Steam version because of the admiration I have for this title.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=649376899\n\nThe story and puzzle designs are far superior to the original. The many side characters have much more of a personality and the pixel art when switching back to the old graphics is just stunning. The Moon Logic has been toned down, so that most things make sense once you think about them. Of course there are sequences like “If this is XX, how much is this?” that bring back uncomfortable memories, but these are minor dents. The new music and voice-over, and audio commentary really add to the experience. The achievements, though a nice addition to the game, were uncreative. Achievements in later remasters, like Grim Fandango and Day of the Tentacle, felt far more rewarding for players (re)visiting these crazy worlds.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=649379092\n\nConclusion\nIf one had to be honest, then one should point out that the game suffers from being too long. The entire game could’ve ended before the Dinky Island segment, instead, even though Dinky Island has a couple of very memorably bits, seems like it's been added to be added. The game’s world is also very vast, in so far that players have to solve puzzles on three different islands simultaneously. This might definitely scare newer players away from the game, especially in this day and age. The only nitpick I personally had though was how Elaine’s face was redesigned in this sequel. She looked much better in the remaster of Monkey 1.","March 26","true","3.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

MI2 went above and beyond anything I could have ever expected.\n\nMonkey Island 2 is the second part in the adventures of Guybrush Threepwood who is, to put it politely, a rather rubbish pirate. After defeating LeChuck and 'rescuing' his love interest Elaine, Guybrush is back in search of a new story to tell and decides he will find the legendary Treasure of Big Whoop. But LeChuck has other plans....\n\nMonkey Island 2 Special Edition brings you the original game with some added bonuses such as entirely remastered graphics, fantastic voice acting, new music, a much better and more intuitive interface and an added hint system (which might just be needed for those new to the franchise). There are also various bits of behind the scene commentary and art and for those of you who are like me; ACHIEVEMENTS. It's one of the few games I actually wanted to completed every single achievement as some were pretty amusing. You can choose to play in the remastered edition or the original and can switch between them at any point quickly and easily.\n\nYou'll spent your time exploring the Caribbean trying to uncover the mystery of Big Whoop. Along the way you'll meet some new faces and some old ones (used coffins popular these days) all of which have larger than life personalities, classic catchphrases and undefiable logical. You'll find yourself talking to every single person you encounter because you know they'll have something good to say.\nYou'll be faced with challenges, puzzles, riddles and even the odd untraditional 'sword-fight' (I've heard you are a contemptible sneak). You'll experience the wonders of love (or at least try), make new friends (and many, many more enemies) and finally make your name as the greatest pirate ever (…).\n\nLucasArts were able to create something fantastic with Monkey Island, combining great gameplay, a wonderful story, loveable characters and perfect humor to make a point and click adventure that'll keep you coming back time and time again. It never feels boring and it never gets old, no matter how many times you've heard the jokes, it just brings back that nice warm feeling.\n\n\nPart of me feels that I missed out on something amazing never getting to play Monkey Island as a child but I am so glad I had a chance to experience it both in it's original glory and remastered. It's a shame LucasArts are no longer around to create games because they created some masterpieces in their life. Monkey Island is one of the best.","April 22","true","4.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/32460/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is a 2010 remake of MI2, the sequel to Secret of Monkey Island. It's a point-and-click adventure game, the ones that would want players to tear hair out. Classic and all. You can switch between remake and original mode on the fly, so you can always beat the game in original mode, if you aren't interested in Special Edition part much. Well, almost, as easy mode was removed from the game.\n\nMonkey Island 2 is quite an excellent sequel. It kept the charm of the first game and improved on it. Main hero grew and got himself a little beard, trying to look like handsome pirate. Moved on with his life, telling everybody of that one time he defeated Le Chuck. The graphics are as beatifully drawn as ever, even if backgrounds weren't cleaned well from pixel artifacts from scanning.\nNot only that, but this time around the music adds another layer of amaziness, playing nice melody in each scene, unlike the first game which used soundtrack sparcely. Game used iMuse for soundtrack, which means that it has more complex transition between music and other such manipulation, which, well, in all honesty is not so noticeable outside of the first location in the game. I am not sure which Sound Card style the original uses in this version, but two things: it's not SoundBlaster and it sounds fantastical. Maybe Adlib. Not sure exactly.\n\nAs far gameplay, it's the Monkey Island sequel, alright. You get to talk with interesting characters. You will get to choose your own reply in dialogue a lot of times, even though it's never impacts the outcome. Hey, it's cool to choose your own way of saying "I'll be back!". The game is quite linear, as expected, though you can often chooce on your own which line of puzzles you was to beat first, walking around all the locations. Sword'fighting' is gone completely.\nAnd puzzles here are as big of ridiculous nonsense as you could get. The situations and puzzles tend to be quite comedical, but as said, they aren't exactly always good. There is few good ones, and many would make you say "oh, that's clever" after solving. Yes, some of puzzles may appear as clever, but no way that you may figure or make sense before solving them, which is shame, most often because of you have to do something random or it just would have never made sense doing in real life. Using monkey as a wrench because of "monkey-wrench" pun? Clever, kinda, but nonsense.\n\nQuite a shame that most adventure games tend to prefer comedy over common sense. Kinda what killed the whole genre in the end.\n\nThe game is divided into four chapters. The first chapter is set on a single island, as you try to drive criminal person related to Le Chuck away off island, all while ruining everybody's else life. In the second chapter, you get two more islands to explore, so you get to ruin more lifes and get to get even more hopelessly lost, trying to search for 4 map pieces, because developers putted puzzles all over the islands. Thr third chapter picks up the pace (and has awesome music for trap) and the last chapter... well, remember how in the first Monkey Island the last chapter was all about kicking butt? In this one your own butt gets kicked with same awesomeness. Quite panic-y and unique experience for adventure game.\n\nAnd sure thing, about Special Edition itself, which is supposed to improve on MI2 experience. Almost, as it removed "Monkey 2 Lite" mode, easy difficulty of sorts, which is supposed to have less puzzles. They probably decided that the new hints system does the job of helping new players just fine, and it does. As well as ability to highlight objects on screen.\nSpecial Edition feels much more refined and complete than Special Edition of the first Monkey Island. You can still easily switch on a fly between remake and original mode. The new interface is not painful like and goes well with mouse. As usual, improved graphics were added, with cleaned up background art and character art that not everybody may dig. Le Chuck looks weird in this one, like pre-rendered model, with way too smooth walking animation with choppier talking animation. Voice acting was added, with music getting improved as well, which not everybody may like too.\n\nAnd sure thing there is some new stuff in, as it now got Steam achievements, for people who can actually pass the first puzzles. New developers commentary mode which can be activated in some scenes to listen to. Not too much of it, it looks like they were recording developers as they were replaying the game and then inserted some of their comments into the scenes. There aren't too many of them either, it feels as if some of the more interesting moments were ignored out. But otherwise, jolly. And you get to unlock concept arts too.\nAnd you can play original version with voice acting too, if you feel like it. Though it seemed that disabling voice acting completely would make dialogues go too fast, so just lowering voice volume to zero is more recommended.\n\nSo yes, excellent remake of a excellent adventure game, as long as nonsense puzzles is what you enjoy. Or you can just abuse hints system and enjoy comedy.","January 28, 2015","true","27.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The UI is much better than in the first part's special edition, so playing feels a bit smoother and more relaxing. There's also an audio commentary by the devs, if one is interested.\n\nThe new graphics are good, but the truth is, MI2 had stunning graphics back in the day, and I actually prefer the old ones to some of the new ones this time. However, it's easy to toggle between the two and check out how the action looks in the other version. I played this game in Spanish like I did the previous one, just for fun to learn a word or two, works well like that also.\n\nRecommended not only for fans of nostalgia, but also for new players looking for a relaxing trip. One just has to remember that you can't do anything wrong or die in the game (well, technically you can in one scene, but that doesn't count here). That's quite different to most games and might sound boring at first, but it isn't.","June 4, 2015","true","5.6"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The game is completely unaltered, and concept art from the original development decades ago was used to fill in the blanks instead of simply extrapolating from what could be seen. The puzzles are just enough of a challenge, and the game is a fair length for a point n' click adventure.

Hints make the game far too easy, though achievements at least discourage their use slightly. Story gives you a bit of a run-around, so you'll be revisiting the same places multiple times.\n\nOVERALL: A true genre-definer.

Enough said.  This Special Edition of Monkey Island 2 is perfectly done and recreated exactly as the original is and was.  You get to hit a key to go from the original to the special edition if you like and the best part is that it switches on the fly with a cool transition.  They really did not change a thing other than the added voice overs and the graphical upgrade.  And the graphical upgrade is absolutely beautiful in its own Monkey Island cartoony way. This game, the original at least, is an absolute classic.  Unlike Sierra games, their competitors at the time, you don't have the ability to die or get stuck in a LucasArts game.  This gets rid of the frustation that these other games may have created.  However, this doesn't mean that puzzles are difficult at times, because they are.  One of the best parts of the game is the humor, so be prepared to laugh when you are swordfighting with insults.","January 7, 2015","true","18.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It's now a pleasure to play the game and listen to the banter, at least until you hit those infuriating puzzles, instead of a chore of fighting the interface and being let down by speech delays. The beginning of the game in particular is a must-play, chock full of hilarious banter. I wasn't as amused by Guybrush's total amoral sociopathy as his bumbling cluelessness in the first game, but the supporting cast definitely made up for it, especially once Stan shows back up into your life. I just wish he had another cameo near the end!\n\nThe puzzles this time around do reflect that increased sociopathy; this is not a game made for the faint of heart, and being stuck is a regular occasion, especially since it's such a huge world with so many locations available and so many items in your possession later on. In the end, occasionally hitting the walkthrough kept me from rage-quitting a few times, and some of the answers really made me question the devs' sanity.\n\nBut it's all part of the package, and what a package it is.

It improves just about everything from the first game in every possible way, a game that was already amazing. The writing is hilarious, the characters are memorable, the artwork is outstanding, the story is phenominal, and it's just a charming game all around. Now, I can't call it perfect -- I think some of the puzzles are a bit too ridiculous and have really cryptic solutions, so expect to have to consult a guide or use the hint system every once in a while.\n\nThe remake itself, on the other hand, is so-so. The voice acting adds a lot of hilarity to the game, and I love the addition of the audio commentary since I'm a sucker for behind-the-scenes stuff. I also like the new, much easier to use and quick interface. However, the update falters in the visual area. The style of artwork for the backgrounds just does not sit well with me. Something about that watercolor style just does not seem quite right. One thing that provides a double-edged sword, though, is the embedding of the original game within this new edition. With the press of a button, you can instantly switch between the old style and the new updated style whenever you want, making it really fun to go from low to high resolution. Unfortunately, they had to compensate quite a bit to accomodate for this. The animation does NOT translate well to modern graphics, and especially not from 10 to 60 frames per second. What one pixel was many years back is now twenty pixels, and it's incredibly glaring at times. I think Rapp Scalion's animation got treated the worst; his reforming animation was one of the visual highlights of the original, and it's now really choppy. In fact, you barely even see him do the thumbs-up before you leave him for good. Overall, the animation is just way too all over the place for my taste.\n\nStill, I can't fault it for what it tried to do. It's a decent remake and I am grateful they went through all this trouble just for us. If you have not played this game yet, go on ahead and give it a try. I fully reccomend it to anyone who is in for a good adventure game.","April 18, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

If it wasn't for the fact that this game's story ties to the first one, I'd recommend skipping the first game and just buy this one, but playing the first game gives some context for this one. It even comes with some insightful audio commentary from the designers while you play the game.

Of course, you should play its prequel first to enjoy it to the fullest.\n\nIf we compare it to The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition, we can see that the interface is more polished and the art style is more inspired. Of course, you can also play the game with the old glorious pixel art style, if you wish. I found the voice acting in both games to be convincing enough, and after playing these updated versions I can't see myself going back to the old ones much. I think they did a good job overall.\n\nTL;DR version: Play it right now. Arrr!","January 5, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/recommended/32460/","frazr_lzer","viad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frazr_lzer/","164 products in account","Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is an excellent remake of the outstanding sequel. Much of the remake work is similar to the first game, though there are more improvements around for an even more refined and polished game. The continued story in the sequel holds up well to the first game, and a nicer remake overall does wonders to making the game experience be a pleasure.\n\nSince this game is a direct sequel in terms of story, it is definitely recommended to play the original Secret of Monkey Island first. Gameplay is much the same of point and click adventure games. In Monkey Island 2 SE, there are a few more touches to smoothly play the game. Rather than interacting and having to bring up the entire list of verbs, right clicking brings up all available actions that can be used. This is very useful since some actions can’t be used on some objects, and it helps to see all available actions that can elicit a response from Guybrush. Item interaction is also easier, with the game defaulting to certain actions when using them. These two features are especially useful for scenes requiring some quick actions, which appear more often in MI2.  A new hint feature appears in the form of object highlighting. It definitely helps for rooms with many objects, where all the objects in the room are shown by pressing Left Click and Right Click together. Also new is the Direct Control mode, where Guybrush can be controlled directly rather than using click actions. This is definitely useful for controller users who want to sit back on a big TV display. The old Classic mode switching ability is still present, and it also allows players to hear the new voiceovers while using the Classic mode UI. Overall, the same point and click gameplay is in MI2, though things definitely changed up for better navigation and controls to make things more comfortable to use.\n\nThe same great redone art style is employed throughout the game like in Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition. Overall, the redone artwork is better in MI2, since the first game did have some stiff and not very refined looking artwork. The backgrounds are a touch more fleshed out and look beautiful, and some of the character animations are smoother too. A select few characters use some 3D animation and move smoothly, perhaps a bit too smoothly from the originals. Still, the overall art quality bump in the sequel is great, with rich environments and distinct characters like the first game, but with even better quality.\n\nMusic plays a big role in the Monkey Island games, and this game still does it well with the remade songs. The sequel has some outstanding music work, much like the first game too. With the game’s soundtrack sounding great, it is nice to appreciate some of the subtleties of the music as well. Some of the themes are reused in certain areas and at times the current song slowly fades into another song when the room changes. They are very nice small touches that make playing the game feel great when they happen, and the recorded instrumentation is always a nice touch on the original MIDI compositions.\n\nThe story of Monkey Island 2 continues from the first game, focusing mainly on Guybrush Threepwood and LeChuck. I won’t elaborate on the story much since it does draw from the first game a lot, though I will say I noted that this game is slightly darker and more dramatic than the first game. There are the series’ classic funny moments, though there are just some actions the player has to take and some story directions the writers made that makes the tone just slightly different. It’s a solid Monkey Island game though, with great moments and a well-crafted story for those who played the first game.\n\nThe remade sequel provides a nice experience, comparably better than the first game in certain parts.  Gameplay is mostly the same, though a few additions to make navigating the game smoother are welcome touches to use. The art is still great to look at, and there are some considerable improvements in quality from the previous game. The music is outstanding as ever, with some subtle transitions and arrangements being employed on the soundtrack for a great listen. Monkey Island 2 Special Edition is a remake that stands up to the original game, with well-deserved refinements that make it a blast to play through.","March 6","true","7.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

First: One of the most enjoyable characters to play as (Guybrush Threepwood). Second: The puzzles are amazing in this game. Without giving too much away, what made the game fun was the fact that you had to move from island to island using things from each to solve puzzles on other islands. Third: Outstanding music! Love pretty much every toon in this game. There is only one part of the game (has to do with the storyline, but the story in general is a good one) that I didn't particularly like from the whole game. That is a pretty impressive feat! I give the game a 9.5/10\n\nIf you don't take my word for how amazing this is, then look at some of these reviews.\n\nhttp://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/18643/page20 (Ranked #8 on adventure games of all-time)\nhttp://www.pcgamer.com/monkey-island-2-special-edition-review/ (90/100)\nhttp://www.ign.com/articles/2010/07/08/monkey-island-2-special-edition-lechucks-revenge-review (8.9/10)\n\nYou might be saying to yourself that the graphics are awful because the game was made back in 1991 or that you hate the new graphics because you liked the old school version. Luckily fans of both can play both by hitting F1. Also this Special Edition is a real treat as voice acting is provided for the new and old school art depending on which one you would like to play. The clunky controls that the first Special Edition had are gone with new and improved ones in their place. So don the adventurer's cap and become "Guybrush Threepwood, mighty pirate!"\n\nCheck out my other point and click adventure reviews on my page!","January 15, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/recommended/32460/","manfromthewall","manfromthewall","http://steamcommunity.com/id/manfromthewall/","97 products in account","I played the original Monkey Island 2 long ago, and loved it then. This remake gave me an excuse to play it again, and it's just as good as back then.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's standard fare for SCUMM engine games: you talk to people, combine stuff with other stuff, give stuff to people, and use all that to solve puzzles. The puzzles could be very head-scratching (especially a particular one towards the end of the game), but for the most part, it was manageable. Being a game focused on humor, some puzzle solutions were absolutely hilarious, once you figured them out. Compared to the original, they really didn't change too much in terms of gameplay, other than changing up the UI a bit so that it's a bit closer to Curse of Monkey Island. What I mean by this is that you have to open up an inventory screen, instead of having it present all the time on the bottom pane, and you click and hold the right mouse button over an object to get a list of options to do with it, instead of having those options always present in the bottom pane like old SCUMM games. It wasn't anything big, but I think it streamlined the gameplay a bit, not forcing you to scroll to the bottom of the screen all the time for actions, though it was annoying to switch to an inventory screen to use items all the time, especially for time-critical puzzles.\n\nAs expected, the music was redone from its original MIDI format. This works well in some places, but what made the music in orignial Monkey Island 2 really special was the seamless transitions of songs with the iMuse engine. They replicate the transitions here, but I felt that, beyond a couple of tracks (like Woodtick), the transitions in some songs as you went from one area to another in a location are a bit forced, compared to the original. This is a side effect of having pre-recorded songs play, instead of having MIDI play and change instruments/notes dynamically, but that's my only gripe.\n\nNew from this remake from the original is the voice-acting, which I felt really added to my experience, and really made it worthwhile to play the game again, after going through the orignal so many times before. As with the Secret of Monkey Island remake, you have several of the Curse of Monkey Island cast reprising their roles for recurring characters, like Dominic Armato for Guybrush and Earl Boen as LeChuck, and as always, they do a superb job. Some scenes in the game were actually a lot funnier when delivered with actual voice-acting this time.\n\nAlso expected from this remake was the overhauled graphics, which made things less pixelated, and added some frames of animations in some areas. However, despite that last bit about added animation frames, the game mostly uses the same number of animation frames as the original, which look really weird with the updated visuals. If you have ever played Street Fighter II: HD Remix, it's a similar to that, where graphics are now HD and more detailed, but the number of frames is the same as the original. It's a bit off-putting, but not too big of a deal. Walking animations for Guybrush and LeChuck have far more frames than the original, though, which looks really nice, but it's just kind of weird to have that where everything else pretty much has the same number of frames as the original game. In fact, in some places in the remake, there are less frames of animation, like with Rapp Scallion's resurrection, which was very well-animated in the original, but was choppy in the remake. I'm unsure why this is, but it bothered me why they did that.\n\nStory-wise, this game is nothing that amazing: you're Guybrush Threepwood, a sort of loser pirate that defeated LeChuck last game, but still doesn't get any respect, so you are looking for the famous treasure, Big Whoop. The game relies mostly on humor to keep your attention, and in that regard, it does its job very well. I sometimes just replay parts of the game to go through all dialogue options, as they all typically have very interesting outcomes.\n\nThe game also includes the original version in it, which you could switch to at any time, like in Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition. It's a nice feature for those who want to play the game in its original form.\n\nI'd say this is a definite pick-up for any graphic adventure enthusiast, and especially for fans of the Monkey Island series or LucasArts adventure games.","September 21, 2014","true","5.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Other than that, some of the puzzles are a bit hard but that's because of the new interface most likely. You can't go wrong with this one, mateys !!!

In the first Monkey Island Special Edition, I was constantly switching to Classic Mode because I found the controls easier to use than the clunky update.  MI2's interface makes the gameplay much more fluid with the "right-click and dial" feature.\n\nOther positives: beautiful artwork, enjoyable voicework, audio commentary, can switch into Classic Mode (if needed).\nAbsolutely worth it, even if you played it way-back-when.","November 20, 2014","true","12.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a faithful remake of a classical game. On top of the features such as voice acting - classic to modern swapping - and improved music that the original had. This also features an option narration by the creators of the series. I found the narration to be distracting and often would interfere outright with what would happen in the game making playing the game and enjoying the commentaries and either or choice. If you enjoy adventure games and never played this one you would do yourself a favor of picking it up. If you have played it before you would probably want to secure a permanent place for it in your steam library. And whichever the case supporting the remaking of old time classics when it is done with this level of skill and tact can only benefit the gaming community as more games get remade. You do not need to have played the original game to enjoy this one and in terms of hours of content for money this is probably the better option if you had to make a choice.","January 4, 2015","true","15.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Lots of people did not understand fully and was led to dislike the ending, rather confused.\n\nWhen I was playing this game, I didn't plan to play Curse of the Monkey Island, the third installment to the series, anytime soon, but I immediately started playing as the ending was so amazingly crafted.\n\nThe puzzles do make sense and are sometimes very funny. The dialogues are fantastic and when you finish the game it leaves you the feeling of wanting to go back just to meet the characters of the game again.\n\nUnless you are a person who strongly dislikes Point 'n Click Adventure games, you should really check this game out.

Also intact is the fantastic gameplay the series is known for and some of the puzzles are very entertaining. Coupled with the added commentary and achievements, this is certainly a game that will appeal to people who enjoy point and click adventure games and even those who aren't too familiar with the series. It does have a lot of throwbacks to the first game so I would reccomend playing them in chronological order for the best experience.","December 20, 2010","true","17.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's very pretty to look at and the music is nice. The characters are distinct and interesting and the dialog is endearing, funny, and delivered well. And the story's not bad...mostly.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this game is that it's too hard. By that I mean that a substantial number of the things you have to do to advance the game are completely idiosyncratic. When I have to break down and consult a walk through for a point-and-click game my reaction to learning the solution usually falls into one of three categories:\n\n1.) "Well, I feel stupid for not identifying that obvious and imminently reasonable solution."\n2.) "Oh, that was clever. I bet figuring that out on my own would have been satisfying."\n3.) "F*** you, game. That makes no sense."\n\nAbout 1/3 through the game, my wife and I broke down and checked a walk through because we had a bazillion inventory items and a half dozen hopelessly stalled leads. The solution was soundly in the "F*** you" category. So were the next two solutions that we had to look up shortly thereafter. At that point we threw in the towel and just sailed through the last half of the game with a walkthrough. I have no shame. We're adults and have stuff to do that doesn't involve spending six months rubbing everything on  everything else in an attempt to move the plot forward. Also, the genuinely clever and funny dialog? It gets a lot less funny when it loops 100 times while you're standing on one screen for 15 min clicking on all the things with all the other things. Admittedly, once we just followed a walkthrough, the game wasn't half bad in a visual novel kind of way.\n\nSo, yeah. I guess I could recommend this game (especially for the $2.49 it is at time of writing) if you are ok with  playing through with substantial help of a walkthrough or are 11 and have months to click on all the things, forever. Or if you're psychic, I guess.\n\nAlso, I thought the ending was really lame, though that's kind of a taste thing. Personally, if I had slogged my way through this without a walkthrough I would have been mad.","February 11","false","11.3"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","1"

That ending irritated me to such an extent 23 years ago that it was the only thing I remembered about the game when I replayed it here as the "Special Edition."  But, the ending isn't the only problem with the game.  But, wait.  Let's start with the positives:  nicely updated graphics from the original, fewer hunt-the-pixel problems than "Secret of Monkey Island" (SoMI) and better interface for verbs and inventory from SoMI.  Unfortunately, the overriding non-ending bad aspect of the game is that most of the puzzles are obscure to the point of not being solvable without hints and cheats.  In SoMI, the puzzles were more in the line of quests and a fairly logical means of pursuing those quests.  In MI2, the puzzles usually consist of randomly looking for things to do in the hopes that there will be some obscure connection to something else you've done or picked up (or will pick up).  Many times I had to go through the hints and scratch my head wondering what the connection was between what I was supposed to do and the process of getting there.  That disconnect and randomness, coupled with the horrible ending just made the game non-fun.  So, unfortunately, I don't recommend it.","January 20, 2014","false","8.1"," 15 of 69 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","15","69","0","0"

Well sonny, pull up a seat around my fireplace. I have something to say about your rose colored glasses of nostalgia; they don't hold up under the bright light of progress.\n\nGames like Monkey Island were amazing when they first came to the market. But then people learned how to make them better. By the end of the adventure game era there were games that had character stats. They had divurged so distinctly from their roots that they were dangerously close to becoming something else entirely.\n\nThey could have very well have gone from that to point-and-click adventure RPGs, but they didn't. Partially because "THE AWARD WINNING POINT-AND-CLICK-ADVENTURE-ROLE-PLAYING-GAME" is really not that catchy, but also because it made a lot more sense just to make a genre of games that appealed to a broader audience et al, Diablo.\n\nCDs came out and it allowed first person point and click games like 7th Guest and Myst to survive on the growing nostalgia of older players who remembered their childhood.\n\nBut these developers didn't realize that humor had been the major appeal of adventure games until much later (Psychonauts?), after a glut of super serious adventure games that took most of that humor out of the equation. If you're old enough, and have played adventure games, I bet there's more than a few jokes from these old games you still remember. Remember the name of the final boss in Myst? I thought not!\n\n"Hey ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, I thought you were going to review Monkey Island!" you squawk in your whiny, cracking prepubescent voice.\n\nOkay, okay... Monkey Island died long ago. It's humor only funny to folks who like archaic computer programmer humor. It's pixel-hunt-click-the-♥♥♥♥ing-stethescope-combined-with-a-solid-gold-packet-of-gum-on-the-featherless-parakeet-logic no longer fun for anyone because they're already solved it a long time ago, or they don't have 4 hours to spend on one puzzle when there's videos of girls in bikinis french kissing cute kittens on YouTube. (I'm watching one as I write this.)\n\nGive this game a pass. Give everything made in this nostalgic vein a pass. Yes, even the new stuff like walking dead. Give your money to developers who are working on the next big idea, not pandering to your inner 13-year-old in some desperate grab to cash in on the IP.\n\nOr heck, give it to me. I will spend it on booze.","February 15, 2013","false",""," 7 of 67 people (10%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","10","7","67","3","2"

The controls feel much improved, and as with the special edition of the first one, the graphics can be switched between the nice hand-drawn style and the old school pixelized with the press of an F key.\n\n2 minor gripes with this game - as mentioned with the special edition of the first game, the hint system was just too tempting to use particularly with my second issue - sooooo much back and forth.\n\nThere are multiple puzzles where once you find a puzzle you have to go to an completely different island for 1 item or to talk to 1 person and then immediately go back. And most of the time there isn't really some foreshadowing or clue as to where to find what you need for that particular puzzle. Or it might not even really be a puzzle, it might just say I need this, and you're like ok that's obviously at this place, but you still have to waste all the time traveling. Some back and forth isn't bad but at times it feels like cheap padding to make the game slightly longer.\n\nOne big complaint - I thought the ending was really, really, stupid. If you've played the 3rd game it doesn't seem so bad but it might ♥♥♥♥ you off if you can't find the 3rd game because the ending scene is sooooo dumb and very out of context with the rest of the game.\n\nHopefully they release a special editon of the third game :)\n\nOverall though, it is exactly what it should be: an entertaining point and click adventure, and a great sequel.","September 25, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This special edition adds quite a lot to the original game and is well worth a purchase for any fans of the classic game, newcomers to adventure games and anyone that is interested in a comical puzzle game. This special edition offers brand new graphics which look fantastic in my opinion, you can also switch back to the classic graphics with the press of a button. You can unlock concept art, listen to audio commentaries and even unlock some achievements.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging, but very few of them are ridiculously complicated like in some other games of this genre. All the lines can now be heard instead of read, which brings them to life. The soundtrack is brilliant and sounds great in this special edition. You also have a very manageable interface whether you choose the old style interaction or the new interaction that seems to be based on the Curse of Monkey Island style.\n\nCan't rate this highly enough, one of my favourite games and one that has been "upgraded" while still remaining as enjoyable as ever.","January 20, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With this remastered version, the game is avaiable to those poor souls that did not experience the game when it was first released (like myself), including both the original graphics ♥♥♥ well as the beautiful graphics of the remastered edition.\n\nHighpoints of the game is the charming, weird and utterly hilarious humour it offers. Main character Guybrush Threepwood's interaction with this weird universe is a prime example of comedy done right in video games. The newly added voice acting is also perfect, enhancing the original game with even more personality. Last, but not least, the puzzles are as hard as ever. It takes a lot of your brainpower and wits to come around the obstacles the game throws at you. While some puzzles may seem a bit too random at first glance, there is actually a brilliant meaning behind them.\n\nI have nothing bad to say about this game, the gameplay is excellent, the controls are easy to use, the music is excellent, the puzzles are hard, and the humour is top-notch. But make sure that you play both the original game as well as the remastered one.","May 8, 2013","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

An island so ancient it was forgotten by men and pirates throughout the entire Caribbean.

This doesn't feel like a cash-in or a retread. It's a great game in it's own right and a fittingly absurd second act in the series. The special edition is as flawless as the remake fo the first game--excellent voice work, lovely art, hot-swapping between classic and special edition, and every detail clearly considered with care.\n\nI think this game is stronger than the first in just about every way. It's longer, it's more varied, the puzles are mostly well considered  (though there are a few ridiculously nonsensical stumpers, as seems to be inevitable in this genre), and behind the excellent humorous writing is a little more meat to each character's bones.\n\nIt's a shame some of the other classics (Grim Fandango?) haven't received the same loving treatment.

I thought that some of the puzzles were way too obtuse, and I thought the ending was as nonsensical as they come (and I HATE the inclusion of Star Wars references - yes, I know it's LucasArts, but still, you don't need to mention Star Wars in all your products!). This remake surprisingly makes things a bit more bearable - maybe because of the hint system, which alleviates some of the frustrations of the game, or maybe because the voice-overs help to give the characters even more personality. But the newly hand-drawn hi-res graphics are pretty awful - the new artist is nowhere near as good. Still, this remake is recommended, just because it doesn't irritate me like the original once did. 7/10","October 6, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This special edition offers brand new graphics which look fantastic in my opinion, you can also switch back to the classic graphics with the press of a button. You can unlock concept art, listen to audio commentaries and even unlock some achievements.\n\nThe puzzles are challenging, but very few of them are ridiculously complicated like in some other games of this genre. All the lines can now be heard instead of read, which brings them to life. The soundtrack is brilliant and sounds great in this special edition. You also have a very manageable interface whether you choose the old style interaction or the new interaction that seems to be based on the Curse of Monkey Island style.\n\nCan't rate this highly enough, one of my favourite games and one that has been "upgraded" while still remaining as enjoyable as ever.","January 20, 2014","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story remains the same in this remake and like the earlier remake, allows you to switch between different versions of the game at will. This time they have also integrated the new voice acting with the original visuals so in a way, we now finally have a "talkie" version of Monkey 2 after so many years.\n\nWhats improved now is definitely the mouse support, which is smooth and responsive compared to the Monkey 1 remake. The control system has been revamped and it feels alot easier to use and play. In addition to the base game, there are extra contents such as concept arts, achievements and best of all even a developer commentary track that appears at specific parts of the game.\n\nThe developer commentary track is definitely the best addition as it gathers some of the original game developers such as Ron Gilbert, Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman where they talk about the fun and little tidbits they had while making the game. Its really interesting to hear them comment about the game which can definitely bring a whole new perspective to the game that we are all already familiar with.\n\nThe only downside i can see is that this remake has removed the "Easy Mode" that was available in the original. In the original, you had an option to choose between an Easy Mode and the Normal Mode, with Easy Mode being reduced and much easier puzzles. Not a big deal at all really, just wanted to point that out.\n\nOverall Rating: 9.5 / 10\nThe best remake done so far, combining a modern user interface with enhanced graphics, with bonus extras for long time Monkey Island fans. Newcomers to the series is advised to play the first game though as this sequel has some jokes that are better appreciated if you had played Monkey Island 1 first. Definitely a worthy buy. Don't miss this excellent sequel to one of the best PC Graphic Adventure games of all time.","May 25, 2013","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Curse of the Monkey Island (COMI/MI3) is one of my first games in this genre, point and click game and it really got me interested for more point and click games. This game, Monkey Island 2 is even older than me!\n\nIn this special edition, the images were hand redrawn and instead of using the verb table, you just click on items on screen directly much like in COMI except for a few puzzles. There are also object highlighting and hint system which you can ask for a hint or literally a pointer. Still, the graphics was just a draw over the old game in order to enable the "classic version" seamless switch and it feels a bit rough in the remastered edition.\n\nI don't know how to review the story without being bias. So just take my word and try out Monkey Island at least for its cultural root. For more beginner-friendly experience the third game, Curse of Monkey Island (not on Steam/GOG and no special edition, its cartoony graphics quite withstanding the time) is much improved.","November 11, 2013","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only after cheating did I realize the clues that were being offerred. I gotta say I did like the Monkey Island 1 special edition more and Tales from Monkey Island more than either of the 2D games.

The controls feel much improved, and as with the special edition of the first one, the graphics can be switched between the nice hand-drawn style and the old school pixelized with the press of an F key.\n\n2 minor gripes with this game - as mentioned with the special edition of the first game, the hint system was just too tempting to use particularly with my second issue - sooooo much back and forth.\n\nThere are multiple puzzles where once you find a puzzle you have to go to an completely different island for 1 item or to talk to 1 person and then immediately go back. And most of the time there isn't really some foreshadowing or clue as to where to find what you need for that particular puzzle. Or it might not even really be a puzzle, it might just say I need this, and you're like ok that's obviously at this place, but you still have to waste all the time traveling. Some back and forth isn't bad but at times it feels like cheap padding to make the game slightly longer.\n\nOne big complaint - I thought the ending was really, really, stupid. If you've played the 3rd game it doesn't seem so bad but it might ♥♥♥♥ you off if you can't find the 3rd game because the ending scene is sooooo dumb and very out of context with the rest of the game.\n\nHopefully they release a special editon of the third game :)\n\nOverall though, it is exactly what it should be: an entertaining point and click adventure, and a great sequel.","September 25, 2014","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The funniest pirate games ever made.\nThis is perhaps not the greatest game in the series, but a great nostalgia trip nonetheless, and not the worst in the series either. It is quite a long adventure, and the puzzles are not always that logical. But the special edition really makes the game much more enjoyable with great voice acting, art and music. And if you don't like that and want to really get into the old original feel, you can play it that way too, as it was made originally.\n\nA must have if you are a fan of monkey island.\nRuns great on any pc","December 26, 2013","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought that some of the puzzles were way too obtuse, and I thought the ending was as nonsensical as they come (and I HATE the inclusion of Star Wars references - yes, I know it's LucasArts, but still, you don't need to mention Star Wars in all your products!). This remake surprisingly makes things a bit more bearable - maybe because of the hint system, which alleviates some of the frustrations of the game, or maybe because the voice-overs help to give the characters even more personality. But the newly hand-drawn hi-res graphics are pretty awful - the new artist is nowhere near as good. Still, this remake is recommended, just because it doesn't irritate me like the original once did. 7/10","October 6, 2013","true",""," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the weakest Monkey Island in my opinion, but the jokes and characters are solid even if the puzzles and plot are convoluted. Even for someone who has played it multiple times (like me), a lot of the puzzles are frustrating and needlessly so. The ending of the game is so bizarre that it's no wonder they sort of gloss over it at the beginning of Monkey Island 3 and pretend it didn't really happen. However, IF you are a fan of the Monkey Island games, and IF you want to play this one, the Special Edition is the way to go. Not that I've got anything against pixelated games (I thrive on old LucasArts ones), but the art is great. Unlike the first Monkey Island Special edition (which had Guybrush with the most hideous hair imaginable), all the characters are well-designed, the remastered music is excellent, and the dialogue is 100% worth it. (Dominic Armato is a GOD.) In general, if you're into adventure games, it is probably worth it to give this one a try, but take with it the caveat that Secret of Monkey Island (MI1), Curse of Monkey Island (MI3) and Telltales' Tales of Monkey Ilsnad (MI5) are all much better candidates. But if you're a completionist or a Monkey Island fan, you would be remiss in not purchasing the Special edition.","December 8, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, before talking about the game within the series, I'd rather talk about the game itself. Here's the points:\n\n- Graphics are extremely similar in style to Secret of Monkey Island, both in the Classic and Remake modes. Classic looks super pixelated but otherwise very consistent and pleasing, Remake has gorgeous art but characters have the same issues than with the prequel: "animations" consist of two frames alternating, characters look like bobbleheads, they don't look at each other when talking and Guybrush's perpetual half-profile pose is super awkward. Watch a video and decide whether you like it. Background art is very good in both cases, though the Remake mode makes easier to spot certain things that you can interact with. Which is nice.\n\n- Gameplay is identical to Secret of Monkey Island and is kept very tight and self-contained for the first part of the game. Then it opens up, letting you hop between three islands. That's not a problem per se, and in fact some of the new additions like a library catalog to peruse are very nice. The big beef I have with MI2 is that a *lot* of times you'll find yourself having to backtrack between locations two or three times, even if you followed a guide step by step. Some puzzles are a bit convoluted, but it's no Discworld.\n\n- Music is great. Some songs return, some are new and I have no complaints about neither. I prefer the old MIDI tracks over the newer ones.\n\n- New for MI2:SE are achievements and... classic mode with voices! Which means I was able to play it through without having to rip the tracks and running it on Scummvm on the side. I could also use the Hint system, with which I had some experiences where it vaguely pointed me where I had to go (great), told me the solution super patronizingly while not telling me the intermediate step I needed to do first (not so great) or straight up crapped out and told me I had to do something I had already done (opposite of great). Overall it worked mostly well though.\n\nOverall Monkey Island 2 is a very well done game that looks, sounds, reads and feels like the first one, with some unfortunate choices regarding backtracking, somewhat more cryptic puzzles and a *really* stupid ending and payoff that Monkey Island 3 would try its hardest to disregard. Nevertheless, it is a better product than MI:SE off the box and definitely better than 4. Still on the Olympus of point and click games, only surpassed by its better LucasArts brethren.\n\n8.5/10.","October 17, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's the weakest Monkey Island in my opinion, but the jokes and characters are solid even if the puzzles and plot are convoluted. Even for someone who has played it multiple times (like me), a lot of the puzzles are frustrating and needlessly so. The ending of the game is so bizarre that it's no wonder they sort of gloss over it at the beginning of Monkey Island 3 and pretend it didn't really happen. However, IF you are a fan of the Monkey Island games, and IF you want to play this one, the Special Edition is the way to go. Not that I've got anything against pixelated games (I thrive on old LucasArts ones), but the art is great. Unlike the first Monkey Island Special edition (which had Guybrush with the most hideous hair imaginable), all the characters are well-designed, the remastered music is excellent, and the dialogue is 100% worth it. (Dominic Armato is a GOD.) In general, if you're into adventure games, it is probably worth it to give this one a try, but take with it the caveat that Secret of Monkey Island (MI1), Curse of Monkey Island (MI3) and Telltales' Tales of Monkey Ilsnad (MI5) are all much better candidates. But if you're a completionist or a Monkey Island fan, you would be remiss in not purchasing the Special edition.","December 8, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My broke my gaming teeth on early Monkey Island and Sierra Quest games. I sort of miss the old school type rather than point and click games but this game is a wonderful remake that stays loyal to the "odd" spirit of Monkey Island but makes it more user friendly to a new generation of gamers. They just don't make games with this kind of wit anymore. If you are of a certain gaming vintage and this game disapoints, you are very hard to please.","January 23","true","57.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
