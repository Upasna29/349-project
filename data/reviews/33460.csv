This is one of the coolest concepts I have ever seen destroyed by an unusable DRM scheme.\n\nFrom Dust is a work of art. Watching the form of the earth change and mould as the player manipulates it brings back memories of Black and White, but with a sense of visual awe that comes from being a much more recent game. It is something that I feel any gamer owes it to themselves to experience at least once. Sadly, I can't recommend buying the game, as I have an ethical objection to UPlay. The alternative, a Chrome app that is free in the Chrome Store, is okay, but ultimately Ubisoft's disingenuity has ruined, or at least limited access to, what I consider to be an actual art piece.\n\nFun fact: Ubisoft actually patched the game to remove UPlay. I had been hoping that would happen and bought it shortly after. Only a few months later, I had been happily enjoying my new game when I launched one day to find UPlay had been patched back in.\n\nUbisoft, I know you're not listening, but stop punishing your customers for buying your products. You did the right thing once before and removed the DRM from this game. Now that the DRM is back on, I would not be surprised to find the number of seeders for this game on torrent sites has spiked. No one wants a content management system inside another content management system, especially if they only have one or two games in the "nested" one.","October 15, 2015","false","2.5"," 135 of 154 people (88%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","88","135","154","2","6"

It's sort of an update on Populous. Way better looking than Populous, though.\n\nI enjoyed playing From Dust through about half of the game's missions. Figuring out how to manipulate the environment to advance your tribe through a series of goals is fun and challenging. But after about 5 levels, the game's challenge became less about figuring out a strategy, and more about executing it with the awkward controller scheme. After about 8-10 levels, it just became too awkward to play. The strategy elements of the game outgrew their clumsy control scheme.\n\nI might recommend this, though, if it's on deep sale. It's pretty to look at, and I had a good couple of hours of fun before deciding the juice wasn't worth the squeeze.\n\n...That damned level with the burning trees.

What other game has free-flowing water, sand, and lava that can all be mixed together to create rock, land, volcanoes, mountains, earthquakes, and tsunamis? If you are hoping that the very end of the game unlocks a no-strings-attached sandbox mode, however, you may be slightly disappointed. The sandbox mode that you get at the end is another level where you get to use all the abilities you gain across the rest of the game to beat the level. After you beat it, you return to the main menu. From there you can choose to play it again, but it doesn't feel at all like a truly free sandbox mode.

While annoying, this is doable and not the only game like it. Wish I had read more of the steam reviews before buying. I would not recommend this game and if you already bought it, my sympathies, but it is not the next Black and White. Buy at own risk, I cannot stress this enough.\n\nControls and Mechanics: Saw a lot of complaints about this. Some buttons are counter intuitive or not 'the norm' but you can grow accustomed to them fairly quickly there's only two really weird ones. UI is spare so you aren't overwhelmed with options. Movement of the cursor corresponds with the movement of your avatar and 90% of the time this is fine and you get used to it fast. The other 10% of the time it will go too far too fast or something at just the wrong time and Bad Things will happen because of it (this has caused me to restart at least one map). Similarly 1-2-3-4 isn't hard to remember, but when the powers attributed to them shift around you have to constantly check the menu to make sure you're using the right power.\n\nThe AI of the people is actually fairly decent - when it works. When it doesn't you get dozens of annoying little voices screaming at you from the top of a hastily erected pillar as rivers of lava flow around them, voices which you cannot stop until either that lava does, or one of your powers comes up, etc. Furthermore idiotic people have cost me wins before, causing me to have to restart some maps several times or making simple tasks very hard.\n\nCamera: Similar to dungeon crawlers, up above and slightly behind the avatar with the option to zoom in a little or to zoom in completely (and not be able to do anything) on just one of your humans. Like the controls 90% of the time this is fine, but when it goes wrong it can be very frustrating giving the fast liquids you are working with.\n\nNow to the reason I am writing this review: some spoilers ahead (I try not to name names).\n\n\n\n\nSurprisingly interesting premise and I genuinely wanted to see my people through and to find out more about what had happened before me. The cut scene between maps gets annoying overtime since its pretty long and just the same footage over and over again but that's not game breaking. What is game breaking is the end. The last level. First of all the game froze just as I was about to complete it so I had to go back and do it all over again (first time this had happened). I hesitate to detail what exactly happens but suffice to say that I was extraordinarily displeased, felt that absolutely NONE of the plot points were tied up (they didn't even try to softball something in or if they did it was too subtle for my shock and disappointment to see it), we weren't given any revelations or massive info dumps, its one giant screw you to the idiot stupid enough to waste their time on this game. Before the end I was willing to give this game a pass and say there were some levels worth redoing, some content worth getting every little bit from, but afterwards I uninstalled the game without second thoughts.\n","February 25, 2014","false","7.0"," 58 of 90 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","58","90","0","2"

Tasked with guiding a primitive tribe on a quest for answers about their past you are given control of the environment, picking up dirt, water, and lava, to clear paths or build them, while fighting off nature itself.\n\nVisually From Dust is appealing with beautiful tropical islands to arid deserts and lava crusted mountains. The way your powers mold the environment also looks very good. The campaign is just about the right length with a lot of extra content in challenges or open worlds if you're craving more in the end.\n\nFor the most part everything works as expected. Occasionally you will drown or burn some of your people but almost always it's because of your own mistake. That being said, occasionally the AI has some pathing issues that lead them into unnecessary danger and get them killed. More common though is having trouble telling where the AI will allow you to go, mostly involving how steep a slope they will walk up. This can cause problems when you think you have a clear path but the AI refuses to move and reverts to complaining about how much they are now on fire.

Set your cities, plan them to be safe, form rivers around them to let your citizens not be eaten by lava. Follow the individuals to get ancient signs and bring themm safe home.\n\nAll in all.

Every mission is essantially a puzzle to solve and with increasing difficulty it results into about 10 hours of top notch entertainment. Some people throwing temper tantrums because of the uplay, I had no problems with it at all (I never had uplay crashing or anything those guys are "experiencing").\n\nThe important thing is that a review that only lists problems with uplay is not a review of this game at all. The game is an overlooked gem, it has amazing aesthetics and so much charm most of the other titles would be envious. It's not a groundbreaking title, as this was done before, but it's done really well.\n\nTwo reasonable criticisms - mouse controls are not that good, and while your villagers aren't exactly lemmings, they can be pretty dumb.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mazian/recommended/33460/","Mazian","Mazian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mazian/","264 products in account","While this is a recommendation in favor of From Dust, it comes with a lot of qualifiers. This is not a game that is worth full price. Yes, the graphics and production value are above average. And yes, this is a well designed God Game. And yes, because of the dynamic way in which the world behaves in reaction to your choices can drastically change the playthrough of any particular level. And ultimately yes, the levels (what few there are) are well designed.\n\nBut that brings me to my first complaint: There are only 12 levels (not counting the finale which doesn't really count since you can easily win simply by not using anything but the Breath of Earth.) For a full priced game, this is scaled more as a tech demo and paying full price is outrageous. (And I mean that to be a bit dramatic, because Fromt Dust is offensively short.)\n\nIt took me roughly 6 hours to beat the game (And I had to play at least three maps over.)\n\nWhich leads me to my next complaint:  There are no saves. If you fail, you have to start over from the beginning of the level. That's not horrible, but it is made painful by the unskippable cutscenes and monologues at the beginning of each level. If you're not beating the level in the first or second try, the tedium of unskippable cutscenes is likely to drive you slightly mad. The cutscenes are "cute" the first time through, but after that they start to grate on your nerves. Your followers don't speak English. Everything is subtitled. While this seems like a novel idea at the beginning, people speaking gibberish at you on the start of each level (coupled with the fact that you cannot bypass it) quickly becomes annoying. This annoyance is mercifully mitigated by the short "single player campaign." (Of questionable value, since it also means there isn't much meat on the bones of this game.)\n\nMy third complaint is that it requires Uplay, Ubisoft's DRM. Ubisoft's DRM is draconian. There are multiple features in many games that simply do not work if you do not have an active internet connection (as opposed to Steam, where that connection is only required on first activation.) Additionally, Uplay fails to install correctly when installed through Steam and you have to jury rig it to work (I put a guide together under From Dust for anyone who buys this and runs in to the installation problem and goes looking for the solution.) While Ubisoft has removed some of the other unpalatable elements of Uplay DRM, it still remains the poster child for "what not to do" among game producers.\n\nHowever, if you catch this on a sale ($5-10 tops) and you can tolerate dealing with Uplay, you will find yourself faced with a few (very few) enjoyable hours with Fromt Dust.\n\nThe gameplay that derives from wielding god powers (water, warth, fire and life-- no air here) is enjoyable. The sense of urgency that derives from the interaction between floods and earth washing away, or between a lava flow steadily working its way into your followers-- these interactions are compelling and interesting.\n\nUnlike Molyneux's "God Game Remake in Godus" there is no farmville experience here. You really are left solely with Godly concerns. How do you unlock your next power?, how do you expand your followers across the world in the face of looming environmental disaster?, how do you help them escape the world before the tenuous balance you've maintained comes crashing down around you and your followers?\n\nThe story is nothing special. It starts as a question, and it ends as a question.\n\nThe graphics are pretty spectacular (for what it is). There's not a ton of individualized follower behavior (You typically zoom all the way out and do your best to stay on top of the floods, or the tsunamis, or the volcanos  that are poised to end your followers.) But the environmental effects are pretty interesting. Water that is volumetric and looks like water. It has waves, it feeds plant life, it cools lava. Lava that is equally volumetric, and which cools when it thins, leaving behind a layered rock strata on which the next wave of lava will rise over it. Each river, be it water or lava, is unique and behaves according to physics which seem realistic (so long as you don't analyze them too heavily.)\n\nThe game performs well (one crash of the game, one crash of Uplay before I applied the installation fix I mentioned earlier). The audio is well designed, if a bit shallow and repetative. The digeridoo sounds are thematic and interesting (but if you don't like them, they become fairly constant in late game and that is likely to get on your nerves.)\n\nAll in all, despite its many flaws, I would give From Dust a positive rating-- at a much lower price point.\n\nIf you happen to see this on sale and feel like a few hours with a novel take on the God game genre, then give this a try. (But don't get it except on sale, because there just isn't much under the hood to justify the cash expenditure.)","November 30, 2014","true","8.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I'm not saying that the graphics of From Dust were ugly, they are not. But you watch the world from high in the air, and the tiny people of this world are just that: tiny, tiny people. But that's not the problem of the game. I admit, I was hoping for a modern version of "Populous". A proper God-simulation. But your powers as a God in this game are highly limited. Everything in this game is highly limited. Your tiny people have to discover or populate around certain obelisks before you can work wonders. Those "wonders" allow you to manipulate the world to a degree. I'd say 80% of the play time, you pick up sand and drop it somewhere else. This way you create land for your tiny people, or you dig ravines for controlling the flow of waters. It's actually quite fun for a while, but pretty soon it gets old. You are doing pretty much the same all the time. From Dust clearly is not the new Populous. The old hit from 1989 beats From Dust in the categories fun, length and complexity. The world of From Dust provides only roughly one dozen maps, and those are not really huge. Between the maps you watch the same boring sequences again and again, you do the same things again and again, move tons of sand from A to B so that after some settling you can get your tiny people to make it to the exit of the world. Maybe that's why we only got a dozen or so maps (of which the first few are pretty much meant as tutorial maps...), because the developers realized that the game concept is simply not complex and entertaining enough to motivate for more than 10 or so hours. French games are often pearls of innovation and creativity, but this one sadly, is not.","August 10, 2014","false","11.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You can manipulate earth, water, and lava to reach village points and to reach the next level. The goal is to find out where these villagers came from. As levels progress they start in island places with lots of water, next to big volcanoes, or in a stretch of dry desert. The villagers have a unique appearance to them, along with their art and music being of unique looks. Controlling matter is easy and the land and water physics is handled very well. These points add for a special experience.\nThe problem lies with the later PC release. As this was made for consoles it wasn't well optimized. Ubisoft requires to use their DLC along with Steam just to use it. The performance is abysmal, but the art and music are sure to please.

It's not one of those games where theres just one way to solve a problem and you have to find it; rather, you are given tools to shape the environment that cause gradual butterfly effects that are sometimes not what you expected and no two soltions will be exactly alike because the environment is constantly changing and adjusting in response to your actions. This creative platform tickled me a lot; I've never seen another game quite like this. Some levels were challenging and frustrating but satisfying in the end; others were a little easy but over all it was well balanced. It was a joy to see what creative challenge came up next each time. My only complaint is that the game is short -- I would love to see more! Also its replayability is limited.

It is as fascinating to watch as it is to play. The fantastic idea gives you the power of being the protective creator of a tribal group of people by modelling nature and landscapes. Even if the main action of piling up and excavating the level's territory may not sound spectacular, I already played it through several times. Not least this is due to the physics which grant sensible effects from all my godlike actions. You have the power over lava, earth and water with which you can shape the landscape in favour of the tribe. The goal is to create a save passage over the map to some ruins which grant access to the next scenario. In this sandbox nature is your persistent opponent. If you are not careful fire burns your village down or flood washes your people away.\n\nA real downside of this game is the story. Actually there is no notable plot which could be called a storyline. Other than the campaign you can also play in custom empty map where you can build your own landscapes.\nIt has also to be stated, that the game requires UPlay since it is an Ubisoft game.\n\nSo it is a game that is different. Unfortunately it is not complete, neither by its extent nor by its plot. Nontheless, it reminded me as well of endless hours in the sandpit during childhood. Not least thanks to the still pretty graphics I recommend this terraforming god game.","November 5, 2014","true","11.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

I was worried that I'd get overwhelmed by a complex, totally freeform sort of experience where deep mastery is required to have any fun at all.\n\nI'm pleased to say that this title avoids that problem. You're generally allowed to ease into the mechanics quite gently, and you also tend to get a lot of warning about things potentially getting away from you. Thoughts like "Oh...what I'm doing with this volcano won't be very helpful in a minute" are much more common than "What the heck just happened?" Your goals are easy to identify, and mistakes are usually correctable. Even when you completely fail, you can usually see where things went wrong.\n\nI also felt that the general mysteriousness of the game world was highly compelling when combined with what you do find out. It all left me wishing that I could have discovered more regarding the goings-on.\n\nIt's true that the behaviors of the people you're trying to help can be a bit less than helpful, especially given their tendency to be finicky about where they can and can't go. (There's also the whole problem of them managing to drown in something like one foot of water.) Even so, the quirks aren't so bad as to ruin the game.\n\n"From Dust" is a slightly quirky but ultimately interesting ride.

Before the later stages, it was relaxing, like playing in a sandbox, yet reasonably challenging without being frustrating or punishing.\n\nUnfortunately, as I got to the later stages, difficulty arose due to a certain totem being placed in a very tricky, high and near-lava location. You have to rely on the individual pathing of the AI, but there's not much indication if they'll be able to get up slopes (when there's multiple potential routes to a location) so trying to get them to this totem without having them try to cross lava is an exercise in frustration. The AI pathing tends to be annoying to deal with as the stages get harder. Also, depending on how you may have tried to build walls in stages with lava, you may find yourself having spent a lot of time on a stage but in a sitation where you'll have to try to destroy some walls to let your villagers get to a totem. Doing this is tedious because you need to use explosive plants (if you made rock walls). I don't understand the point in letting players manipulate something in such a tedious way instead of providing a less time-consuming method.\n\nOverall, dealing with the lava is quite frustrating, especially with how it can completely wipe out villages if so much as a particle touches some of your greenery. I understand having a challenge makes things more fun, but the way this challenge is presented is more frustrating than entertaining, because a small mistake can reset your entire stage progress.\n\nSlight variation on the level design and the lava mechanics would've probably made the game fun, but as it is I can't recommend it because of the unpleasantness of the later levels. Challenge should not come from dealing with the stupid AI, and mistakes shouldn't make you feel like you've just wasted a bunch of time, because that's no fun. Towards the end it just became not pleasant to play anymore. It's a shame because the sandbox mechanics are very entertaining to interact with - it's almost like they weren't sure whether they wanted to frustrate players with hard challenges or provide a relaxing, slow-paced sandbox game.","November 9, 2014","false","5.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

It has been qutie awhile since I played this but here is what I remember.\n\nThe Action\n\nGod mode game you must protect your people from dying from basically natural disasters, mostly floods and volcanoes.  You gain abilities to pick up water, earth, lava and mix and match them to build islands or escort your people to level exits.  There is a story mode and a competitve mode (leaderboard type deal).\n\nThe Good\n\nNice graphics and music, pretty sure the majority of the games budget went to these two.  There are some entertaining cut scenes of your people running around doing tribal type stuff.\n\nPhysics are pretty accurate and the water/lava simulations are pretty sweet and can be fun to goof around with for awhile.\n\nThe Bad\n\nThe game is really short, I played through the story and spent quite a bit of time in the competitve mode but it gets boring pretty quickly, well maybe not boring but there just isn't much to do, especially if you don't have any friends on Uplay.\n\nPricey- this goes in with the length of the game, I feel like off sale it's just overpriced even when its half off I'd be hesitant to recommend it\n\nUPlay- Ubisofts version of steam, I didn't like it at all it was buggy, clunky, and right after I played this game they had some sort of data breach so that put me off and I just don't buy ubisoft any more\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nThe game itself isn't necessarily bad but I just can't recommend it unless it's on a hefty discount sale and the UPlay requirements were removed","November 25, 2013","false","10.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Moving terrain around and using it to affect the lives of the indigenous population is great fun. The fun for me at least partially stems from my sense of nostalgia of playing in the backyard and digging out villages for my populations of action figures to live in. Also, I have a weak spot for games in which physics manipulation is the basis of the mechanics.\n\nNow for the bad\n\nFirst off screw uPlay. This game somehow got deleted from my uPlay account so now I can only play it in offline mode. However I can't inherently judge the game for that failure, just Ubisoft's publishing policies. Buyer beware, I guess.\n\nSecond, it feels like a console port. There's minimal graphics options. The controls are awkward and become a hindrance on the later, faster paced levels. The menus are unpolished and make it a pain to navigate between level selection and other important features.\n\nIn conclusion I liked this game but there are some major issues with it's packaging. If From Dust was remade or they made a sequel that controlled better, operated better on the PC environment, and didn’t include mandatory uPlay integration, then I would definitely be able to recommend it.","December 28, 2013","true","13.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The goal is to guide your tribe to the right place(s) while protecting them from natural disasters. This can be done by changing the environments. So, for example, you can create walls to protect them from lava or you can create a hole in the ground to keep the water in. It's all up to you, as long as you can protect them. But it gets challenging pretty fast.\nThe graphics are pretty sweet, especially for a downloadable game. It definitely has a nice style. The sounds are very well done as well.\nAll in all, it's a game I would recommend. There aren't that many 'God sim' games around these days, so From Dust is a great addition to anyone's collection.\n\n[Rating: 77/100]","January 13, 2012","true","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

COntrary to his most famous creations which were side scrolling adventures, From Dust is a God-game.\n\nTo make this review short, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I spent about 18 hours with the main missions, not touching the challanges, so it has plenty of content to keep you satisfied. Plus the game looks amazing. The only gameplay-related minus is the lack of a sandbox mode, but that's alleviated by the fact that the last mission is exactly that: a sandbox mode. Though I think it should have been a separate mode, not locked at the end of the campaign.\n\nNow, to speak a bit about its technical problems. I will start by saying that I had absolutely no problem with any of the problems most people bring up when talking about From Dust, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.\nIts most common problems are:\n- bad mouse and keyboard controls. I was not affected as I played with a gamepad. If you own a gamepad (and most PC users do nowadays), do yourself a favor and play this game with it. It wills ave you a lot of frustration and it will help you enjoy the game.\n- locked framerate. Yes, the game is locked at 30fps and there are no excuses but: it hasn't bothered me at all since this is an incredibly slow paced game. In this case 30fps is completely acceptable and doesn't realy break the game or the immersion in any way.\n- uPlay. Everyone and their mother are complaining about uPlay. It didn't bother me at all, and to be honest I don't see how anyone that isn't a kid would be bothered by it. It is just another UI layer that didn't bother me at all. It just loads with the game and remains in the background while I play. Just like steam. To be bothered by one but not by the other is completely immature in my opinion.\n- Always online DRM. By the time I played this game, Ubisoft removed always online DRM so right now this is a non-issue.\n\nIf you like god-games, do yourslef a favor and play From Dust. It's not really as good as the pold Populous games (nostalgia may be a factor in my case), but it is still pretty good and offers a lot of content. The game is also pretty cheap nowadays (you can get it in a sale for 5 dollars or euros).","November 30, 2015","true","19.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

You're a god, sure. With powers over nature, sure. You lead a tribe of people, sure. But this is really a puzzle game. You move dirt and lava and stuff around to make a way for your people to reach new village spots. That's it. Oh and there's no real progression between levels. If that sounds fun, have at it.\n\nI expected more, and I guess that's my fault for not reading enough reviews.\n\nBUT, the mouse controls suck. I'm four levels in and I still hate how the mouse controls. I regularly pick up water instead of the dirt I want that's next to it. Directing my people to a new spot is hard because getting the mouse to settle on that spot is hard. There's some really weird acceleration going on. And the game forces me to use uPlay. Despite my admission that I shouldn't have bought this game, I think this paragraph still warrants a thumbs down, because I tried to enjoy it for what it is and these frustrations stopped that.","September 2, 2014","false","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

This game has a lot to offer in terms of beauty and inspiring animations where it comes to the forced generated into the environments.\nThe problem is that this game feels like it was supposed to be more, couldn't reach its high-end goals, and so settled for being a simple puzzle game.  I wanted to care about the little tribes people, but, because I could really do nothing more meaningful with them than build them paths and tell them to go somewhere, they never really became all that endeared to me.

I would have greatly enjoyed watching them fish and farm and hunt or just about anything which made them feel alive to the gamer.  I really think that, with the bare bones nature of your godly influence in the world of From Dust, this game needed more content and variety within its little living world.\nAnyway, going from scripted event to scripted event works well enough for a FPS or arcade modes in other genres, but it does very little for a game like this, in my mind and while many of the natural disasters you are trying to aid your little pointless people in surviving are rather glorious, they actually leave you, a god, feeling rather small and futile when faced with their might and splendor.\nI wouldn't really recommend this game for more than a cursory playthrough and a few moments of drooling over the fluid physics.

BUT\n\nThere are lots of CONS:\n\n-	Game is super short.\n-	The controls are unfriendly.\n-	Can’t skip scenes.\n-	No depth, no challenge.\n-	Only thing worth seeing is the physics.\n\nSeems that this game was a let’s-release-a-game-with-cool-physics” but nothing else.\n\nIt is a lot of fun to play with the elements and see how you can affect the world. But that’s it.\n\nAs far as all the negative comments concerning UPlay: ignore them. UPlay is UPlay, and From Dust is From Dust.  Even if UPlay were so bad (entering a key and logging in, not a hate-trigger for me), they are two completely unrelated things.\nSo, if the game is on sale and you enjoy god-like games, physics/cause-effect, give it a go. I personally felt like “is that it?” at the end. So expect that if you like these sort of games.\n\nBut still, the concept is good and this is the only game out there where you can manipulate the world like this, and it’s fun.

Yes, it requires UPlay but at this time and age UPlay is just a minor inconvenience and the lockup issue is well documented and easily fixed.  Eric Chahi is a gaming genius and I wish he made more games.  From Dust is a worthy entry in the sandbox god-game genre.  It's not another Populous if that's what you're looking for here, it's a game about a deity that protects its tribe against the forces of nature as they trace their heritage across a harsh world.  It's admittedly short but that saves it from overstaying its welcome.  It's novel and fun, and the visuals are something you just have to experience.  You will not regret playing this game.","June 17, 2015","true","9.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sometimes the game gets seriously difficult. I remember trying to beat a few levels for several hours.\n\nThe graphics are stunning and it has good replayability. I've played the game through twice and it's really easy to pick up waste a few hours every once in a while. After you beat the game you unlock a sandbox mode where you can create your own small world. (So much fun!)\n\nIt seems that Steam did not record all those hours (~40) I've played this game.\n\n----[Rating weighted based on the genre]----\n\nStory: 4/5\nGameplay: 4/5\nChallenge: 4/5\nDiscovery: 3/5\nReplayability: 4/5\nAesthetics: 5/5\nVisuals: 5/5\nAtmosphere: 4/5\nMusic: -/5 (I don't remember it well enough to rate.)","November 25, 2013","true","2.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

You control "The Breath" which allows you to manipulate earth, water and lava and do all sorts of crazy elemental stuff, but it all boils down to getting the tribe people to the next village and protecting them from other elemental forces like tsunamis and volcanoes.

This game is wonderful.\nThankfully someone here in the review section has gracefully provided a very useful guide on how to get the ungodliness that is UPlay to work.\nSo, I'm not even going to talk about that. It is what it is. I never had any problems with it.\nFrom Dust on the other hand, is actually an insanely addictive game. My only wish is that it was longer. I absolutely love the combination of simulation god-game and the challenges you are given to overcome. Every time I put this game down, I consistently had the nagging urge to play it more.\nYou can play the game however you like, whether you want to speed through the challenges or take your time unlocking everything (the extra challenge mode levels are unlocked by various things like finding totems on the landscapes or getting 100% vegetation on the current land). The game is a challenge, but there is no time limit for completing the levels and you can take your time if needed. Its actually fairly relaxing. The extra challenge levels you unlock are fun also.\nThe nature simulations are very fun to play with and it controls very well. The controls themselves are very easy to use. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad. (I use the xbox 360 gamepad for windows.)\nAnd yes, this game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The music, the sounds; everything is wonderful. The simulations in this game - the water and volcanoes expecially - are really amazing and fun to manipulate.\n\nIts not very long, I completed the main story in about 9 hours, but its a very nice, satisfying experience all in all. I think I may play it over again, and see if I can complete the challenges using different methods. It doesnt seem like any two playthroughs of this game will be the same. I still have many extra challenge levels complete too (there are lots of them).\n\nDont disregard this game simply because the DRM is bad. If you can put up with the bit of extra effort it takes to get UPlay running, I promise this game is worth it.\n","December 26, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamburgergrindcore/recommended/33460/","hamburgergrindcore","Ol' Billy Cheese Balls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamburgergrindcore/","378 products in account","God Games have always been one which you've have the overall power the wield the world at your fingertips, with each God Game type having their own different style to give, showing the emphasis of what type of god you are in that specific universe. Sometimes the wielding of nature (which is most common in god games) is used to a much greater advantage, one of which provides the player to have much more strategy that simply clicking on the environment. From Dust perfectly does this.\n\nFrom Dust developed by Ubisoft is a game where you play as a deity which has the power to shift the lands underneath the native people's feet for their own means of survival. From Dust's story synopsis is about a group of native in which their land is torn by the natural causes, until they summon their god (the player) to help them strive to a new land in which they may find a peaceful location to settle on with any nature causes harming their colony.\n\nThe Story is told through a more native style tale which help give a more tribal and authentic feel to the games' art style, with such a story it can be consider to have contain a hidden message or parable. (Though I'll overlook that)\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much like other god games. You have to move around the natural element of the world to help suit the needs of the native people, to get from point A to B, which 'B' is a tunnel to the next level. The native people set up camp near a tribal totem pole in which it gives you various additional power to prevent natural disasters or pave way to an exit. This is the games' strongest point: the powers that the player has. The game makes it clear that you can grab and bend the natural element to your will. Ubisoft was clever with this technique as each level gives a limited amount of supply of a certain element. This is to make you strategise the current situation and makes you focus on rationing certain elements. Sometimes they give too much of an element and its up to the player to prevent that specific element destroy the tribes people. Sometimes this can done through kites which give special powers prevent certain elements from destroying the tribe.\n\nThe art style of the game is somewhat unique, in that it uses more tribal colours and texture which exist in more tropical environments, like Hawaii and Togo. The graphics are technically well designed with very little glitches or flaws that exist within the game.\n\nThe flaws that exist within the game are the sometimes unfairness of a certain level, elements attacking the tribe too quickly and giving a game over. Another is the AI which has a lack of pathfinding when going to a location which is perfect valid with no obstacles in the way. Last but not least is the somewhat lack of a sandbox mode or more time to use your creative skill in building nature constructs. Personally I had a great time using some elements to create damns and bridges, changing the flows of certain elements is what is highly enriching besides the strategy element of the game.\n\nOverall From Dust is a great game which I highly recommend to anyone who loves God Games and want a bit more strategy as well.\n\n7.75/10.0 (Very Good)","August 17, 2014","true","58.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You play as a tribal spirit or god, but your power is far from absolute. The world is made of a few fundamental puzzle pieces: rock, earth, water, lava, and several landscape-altering varieties of tree. It's your job to assemble those pieces in a way that achieves the objectives of each level.\n\nThe graphic design of the game is amazing. The tilt-shift blurring and low camera angle give the levels a sense of hugeness. The textures are lovely, and they always blend nicely across the constantly changing terrain. The foliage looks thick and lush, and the flowing water and lava look excellent, although they don't quite come as close to photorealism as other parts of the game.\n\nPerhaps most important, the little villagers are amazingly well-designed. In some ways they look similar enough to real-world tribes that they seem familiar. But little details like their oversized masks and strange huts give them a bit of an alien feel as well. They're tough little guys trying to survive in a world that is completely indifferent to them. It makes you want to help them.\n\nOverall, the setting is beautiful and strange and brimming with hinted possibilities. It left me wanting something like an RPG set in this world - something where you could be surrounded by it, rather than looking down on it from a distance.\n\nThe gameplay itself is fun, sometimes challenging, and occasionally irritating.\n\nShaping the world is intuitive, and the excellent physics simulation makes it a joy to dig a hole or build a hill, and just see what happens as a result. Unfortunately, the results are often unpredictable, and a single wrong move can wreck a great deal of work before you realize what's happened. Additionally, many of the levels have problems that need to be addressed in a limited time frame, and the added rush makes screw-ups even more likely, but last-second victories are that much more euphoric.\n\nIf you like puzzle games, and especially if you prefer a bit of frantic action over contemplation, "From Dust" is worth getting.","August 11, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamburgergrindcore/recommended/33460/","hamburgergrindcore","Ol' Billy Cheese Balls","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hamburgergrindcore/","378 products in account","God Games have always been one which you've have the overall power the wield the world at your fingertips, with each God Game type having their own different style to give, showing the emphasis of what type of god you are in that specific universe. Sometimes the wielding of nature (which is most common in god games) is used to a much greater advantage, one of which provides the player to have much more strategy that simply clicking on the environment. From Dust perfectly does this.\n\nFrom Dust developed by Ubisoft is a game where you play as a deity which has the power to shift the lands underneath the native people's feet for their own means of survival. From Dust's story synopsis is about a group of native in which their land is torn by the natural causes, until they summon their god (the player) to help them strive to a new land in which they may find a peaceful location to settle on with any nature causes harming their colony.\n\nThe Story is told through a more native style tale which help give a more tribal and authentic feel to the games' art style, with such a story it can be consider to have contain a hidden message or parable. (Though I'll overlook that)\n\nThe gameplay is pretty much like other god games. You have to move around the natural element of the world to help suit the needs of the native people, to get from point A to B, which 'B' is a tunnel to the next level. The native people set up camp near a tribal totem pole in which it gives you various additional power to prevent natural disasters or pave way to an exit. This is the games' strongest point: the powers that the player has. The game makes it clear that you can grab and bend the natural element to your will. Ubisoft was clever with this technique as each level gives a limited amount of supply of a certain element. This is to make you strategise the current situation and makes you focus on rationing certain elements. Sometimes they give too much of an element and its up to the player to prevent that specific element destroy the tribes people. Sometimes this can done through kites which give special powers prevent certain elements from destroying the tribe.\n\nThe art style of the game is somewhat unique, in that it uses more tribal colours and texture which exist in more tropical environments, like Hawaii and Togo. The graphics are technically well designed with very little glitches or flaws that exist within the game.\n\nThe flaws that exist within the game are the sometimes unfairness of a certain level, elements attacking the tribe too quickly and giving a game over. Another is the AI which has a lack of pathfinding when going to a location which is perfect valid with no obstacles in the way. Last but not least is the somewhat lack of a sandbox mode or more time to use your creative skill in building nature constructs. Personally I had a great time using some elements to create damns and bridges, changing the flows of certain elements is what is highly enriching besides the strategy element of the game.\n\nOverall From Dust is a great game which I highly recommend to anyone who loves God Games and want a bit more strategy as well.\n\n7.75/10.0 (Very Good)","August 17, 2014","true","58.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Ubisoft has continued on their quest to show the world how little they care about PC gamers and From Dust is one of their worst showings yet. From Dust lacks any sort of graphics customization, only giving you the option of changing your resolution. Another huge flaw is the lack of mouse sensitivity option, causing you to have to manually go into your mouse settings and change your sensitivity just to be able to play the game (and of course you also have to change it back when you finish). The worst part about being a direct console port is that From Dust is locked at a maximum of 30 FPS for seemingly no reason at all. The only plus I can think of is that the game is reasonably priced (15) though I highly suggest to not buy it, the developers have already been paid and giving Ubisoft your money only influences them to continue abusing PC gamers.\n","August 17, 2011","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"

Each level/map consists of completing a terrain puzzle to capture control points, which opens the "portal" to the next level. The terrain physics are fun, but this game is too easy and short for me to really enjoy it.\n\nThe puzzles are too simplistic. In each level you have only a small set of powers available to you (which can change from map to map) which you use to adjust the landscape of the level to complete your puzzle. In my first playthrough of the game, there was only one level I had to stop and think about how to solve. I was expecting more difficult puzzles from a god-mode game and more interesting maps.\n\nThe landscape is not as "pretty" as I would expect from a game focused completely on *the landscape,* so I was expecting the art in this to be a bit better.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalechippu/recommended/33460/","kalechippu","Lester Knight Chaykin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalechippu/","55 products in account","I think its a little unfair to judge this game simply by the shortcomings of Ubisoft and their terrible DRM. This game is wonderful.\nThankfully someone here in the review section has gracefully provided a very useful guide on how to get the ungodliness that is UPlay to work.\nSo, I'm not even going to talk about that. It is what it is. I never had any problems with it.\nFrom Dust on the other hand, is actually an insanely addictive game. My only wish is that it was longer. I absolutely love the combination of simulation god-game and the challenges you are given to overcome. Every time I put this game down, I consistently had the nagging urge to play it more.\nYou can play the game however you like, whether you want to speed through the challenges or take your time unlocking everything (the extra challenge mode levels are unlocked by various things like finding totems on the landscapes or getting 100% vegetation on the current land). The game is a challenge, but there is no time limit for completing the levels and you can take your time if needed. Its actually fairly relaxing. The extra challenge levels you unlock are fun also.\nThe nature simulations are very fun to play with and it controls very well. The controls themselves are very easy to use. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad. (I use the xbox 360 gamepad for windows.)\nAnd yes, this game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The music, the sounds; everything is wonderful. The simulations in this game - the water and volcanoes expecially - are really amazing and fun to manipulate.\n\nIts not very long, I completed the main story in about 9 hours, but its a very nice, satisfying experience all in all. I think I may play it over again, and see if I can complete the challenges using different methods. It doesnt seem like any two playthroughs of this game will be the same. I still have many extra challenge levels complete too (there are lots of them).\n\nDont disregard this game simply because the DRM is bad. If you can put up with the bit of extra effort it takes to get UPlay running, I promise this game is worth it.\n","December 26, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main story tries to fit in between levels and in bits that aren't shown as you play. The gameplay is amazing with water/lava/sand physics to make you ♥♥♥ that are just flawless. Really strategic the more you play and the power ups are never explained more past just what they're called and you have to figure out what some do by using them which is fine. You have no real enemies except the elements, but the villagers are a pain in what they accept as a path to walk on and a small amount of water can stop a village to be built. Lava never wants to build as much as it should and seems to just flatten what you put it on. Natural disasters are mainly just annoying but if left unchecked will destroy you. Sandbox mode is fine but you'll just put things to the extreme, big pile of sand or big lava spawning, and not really use it after that.

The controls are a bit difficult to get a grasp on at first but are easy to use once you have the hang of it.  The game itself is visually stunning with detailed shots of the landscape and your tribe.  However, the game has been difficult to play for longer than bursts of ten or fifteen minutes without those same beautiful visuals slowing and eventually freezing my computer until the game shuts down or has to reboot.  My computer has never had these kinds of problems with games before and I am usually patient enough that if I can get a good amount of play time in then I don't mind.  From Dust, however, shuts down too frequently to really do much in a playing session.","January 12, 2014","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is wonderful.\nThankfully someone here in the review section has gracefully provided a very useful guide on how to get the ungodliness that is UPlay to work.\nSo, I'm not even going to talk about that. It is what it is. I never had any problems with it.\nFrom Dust on the other hand, is actually an insanely addictive game. My only wish is that it was longer. I absolutely love the combination of simulation god-game and the challenges you are given to overcome. Every time I put this game down, I consistently had the nagging urge to play it more.\nYou can play the game however you like, whether you want to speed through the challenges or take your time unlocking everything (the extra challenge mode levels are unlocked by various things like finding totems on the landscapes or getting 100% vegetation on the current land). The game is a challenge, but there is no time limit for completing the levels and you can take your time if needed. Its actually fairly relaxing. The extra challenge levels you unlock are fun also.\nThe nature simulations are very fun to play with and it controls very well. The controls themselves are very easy to use. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad. (I use the xbox 360 gamepad for windows.)\nAnd yes, this game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The music, the sounds; everything is wonderful. The simulations in this game - the water and volcanoes expecially - are really amazing and fun to manipulate.\n\nIts not very long, I completed the main story in about 9 hours, but its a very nice, satisfying experience all in all. I think I may play it over again, and see if I can complete the challenges using different methods. It doesnt seem like any two playthroughs of this game will be the same. I still have many extra challenge levels complete too (there are lots of them).\n\nDont disregard this game simply because the DRM is bad. If you can put up with the bit of extra effort it takes to get UPlay running, I promise this game is worth it.\n","December 26, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've had some of my best moments introducing friends to game using this one. I dont know how the game is typically marketed but I say its a puzzle game, and you have to do a specific set of thing to get your tribe (or whatever) from one mission to another. After you beat a level you can go back to completed levels to mess around and I tend to have the most fun messing around.\nOn the otherhand the interface can be frustraingly difficult to work with (enough so that I've had people give up before getting past the 2nd level) and a lot of people wont have fun playing because of it. The AI of the units you have to control tends to leave them standing at cliffs and rocks that are difficult to cross waiting for the people to make them a path over them instead of walking around them on the simpler path and on some occasions they wont take a control point claiming there is an obstruction when they are standing right by it. The only game mode is the puzzle mode starting you off in increasingly more dire situations which can make play exhausting.\n\n","July 11, 2014","true","46.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is basic (and not the focus of the game) and there are no real characters besides your virtually identical-looking natives and the only narrative is that which you hear at the begining of each stage. However the voice-over does stand out as it is spoken in a Bahasa Indonesian language that is neat to listen to and don't worry, there are subtitles in English.\nThe real fun comes from the gameplay where you gather up sand, lava, water and more in an effort to keep your people alive and help them to build and maintain their villages in ridiculously dangerous environments such as within the crater of an active volcano, hot damn! These scenarios can defintely be challenging as you will be forced to stop and think in order to plan the best course of terrain alteration or disaster will befall your villagers and you'll be forced to re-examine your strategy or even re-start the stage.\nI also have to point out the level of realism attached to the various elements in that lava flows like you'd expect, water from tsunamis flows down from elevated portions of the land to pool in recesses, etc. Thanks to this you'll really feel like you're crafting a believable world and perhaps even learn to appreciate how difficult it must be for certain people (both past and present) to struggle against the elements.\n\n8/10","December 3, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You control "The Breath", which is basically your cursor, and it can suck up different types of matter and drop it where you like.  Using this ability, you get your Lemming-like tribe to be able to find certain areas that unlock certain things.\n\nThe story is...different, but doesn't get in the way, mostly it's about the puzzles.  You'll have challenges you have to accomplish before you're able to complete the map, and also there's extra stuff you can sometimes find that give you perks of some variety.  Some hazards you'll have to overcome are static, like a river you must divert; others are dynamic events that can impact the whole map.\n\nAll in all, if you have a decent system, don't mind UPlay, and love the genre, From Dust is worth it, best on sale.","July 19, 2015","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As you tame the wilderness, rivers will change paths, hills will erode, and the lava shapes new land. It's definitely fun to play with, and it's very rewarding to see a ruthless wasteland turn into a peaceful grove once you correctly divert the hazards.\n\nThis game's weak point is everything else (except the game's mythos; that's cool too). The story is way too short (beat it 100% in <3 hrs) and rather easy. With such cool tools to use, I really wanted more of the sandbox-type story levels, to really show off what I could do. Huge disappointment. There's a challenge mode, which I beat in about another 3 hours.\n\nI'd still recommend this game at $15, but be prepared for the short length. Also watch out for Ubisoft's wicked always-online DRM. Definitely get it if it's on sale.","August 18, 2011","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love making rivers and helping the plants grow across the maps. The tribal lore is interesting too, I rather like the tales of the plants and animals.\n\nOn the down side, the levels load before the dramatic entry music finishes, creating a jarring moment where it should have been a nice fanfare entry, and one can’t interact much with the tribespeople. I’m wondering if the loading time music cutoff is because I've got it installed on an SSD and it might behave better on a traditional (slower-loading) platter drive.\n\nThese are relatively minor though. It’s really about playing with the landscape like a helpful, mysterious deity. If you, like me, enjoyed spending hours playing with dirt and water as a child, you might rather dig From Dust.\n","May 22, 2013","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Where in Black and white you could cathartically hurl idiot villages against ♥♥♥♥ because they angered you, in 'From dust' all you can do is sit and watch and hope they dont develop better path finding before the next tsunami hits.","September 8, 2011","true","0.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not Populous (to which it has been compared to in various reviews) or Black & White or even Dungeon Keeper. And this is why people hate From Dust, they compare it to the wrong genre. Although you can't slap your people on the face, drown them intentionally or crush their homes and dreams (well, you can, but then it's game over) From Dust does have similarities to these titles. It has puny little humans and an omnipotent player that controls the surroundings and as such, indirectly also these puny little people. And it is beautiful and it has a physics engine unlike any other game. But in my view, From Dust is most reminicent of Lemmings: guide your people (the puny little humans) to safety via manipulation of the world around them. Raise the earth to create a bridge over water or drain a pond. And it is actually pretty cool. A bit repetitive in the long run perhaps, but a nice niche game.","October 2, 2011","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is wonderful.\nThankfully someone here in the review section has gracefully provided a very useful guide on how to get the ungodliness that is UPlay to work.\nSo, I'm not even going to talk about that. It is what it is. I never had any problems with it.\nFrom Dust on the other hand, is actually an insanely addictive game. My only wish is that it was longer. I absolutely love the combination of simulation god-game and the challenges you are given to overcome. Every time I put this game down, I consistently had the nagging urge to play it more.\nYou can play the game however you like, whether you want to speed through the challenges or take your time unlocking everything (the extra challenge mode levels are unlocked by various things like finding totems on the landscapes or getting 100% vegetation on the current land). The game is a challenge, but there is no time limit for completing the levels and you can take your time if needed. Its actually fairly relaxing. The extra challenge levels you unlock are fun also.\nThe nature simulations are very fun to play with and it controls very well. The controls themselves are very easy to use. I recommend playing this game with a gamepad. (I use the xbox 360 gamepad for windows.)\nAnd yes, this game is absolutely gorgeous to look at. The music, the sounds; everything is wonderful. The simulations in this game - the water and volcanoes expecially - are really amazing and fun to manipulate.\n\nIts not very long, I completed the main story in about 9 hours, but its a very nice, satisfying experience all in all. I think I may play it over again, and see if I can complete the challenges using different methods. It doesnt seem like any two playthroughs of this game will be the same. I still have many extra challenge levels complete too (there are lots of them).\n\nDont disregard this game simply because the DRM is bad. If you can put up with the bit of extra effort it takes to get UPlay running, I promise this game is worth it.\n","December 26, 2014","true","19.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I will never ever buy another Ubisoft game again and I recommend you join me in blacklisting them.\n\nRemove uplay plugins from FF: about:config and set plugin.expose_full_path TRUE, then about:plugins to see the full path; then physically delete them from where they live on your hard drive.","August 2, 2012","false","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It is challenging at times, but also greatly amusing taking sand for instance until there's only rock left underneath then depositing it somewhere else maybe to change the flow of a river or taking water and dumpinjg it somewhere then watching it splash and flow as real water would. This game is very unique in that I've never played another game like it. The graphics are gorgeous as are the effects.\nMy only complaints is that there isnt a sandbox mode(or at least wasnt the last time I played) which I think would be more entertaining than levels with an end goal. I also think it would be cool if they would have more of a society or city building aspect that you would then have to protect from the elements (There are villagers you have to protect, but their society doesnt develop much past small villages). Finally I'll say that while I like this game I would definitely wait until it's on sale because while it is worth buying it's not worth $15 especially considering I got frustrated with it after 22 hours ($15 dollars to me should give a person at least 96 hours worth). Though if you like a challenging game that will get you frustrated to the point where you have to take a break (like old school games from when I was a kid) only to come back with a new strategy and beat the level then you'll like this game. I personally prefer more relaxing, less challenging games, but there simply isnt any other game like this.\nStill it's a great game if you're a connoisseur!","May 9, 2015","true","23.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only problems are Uplay and the length. I believe the problems with Uplay that meant that this game couldn't be launched have now been fixed (at least, I've never had any issues since I bought it), so that's something.\n\nThe gameplay is essentially a puzzle-based god game, where you control the elements earth, lava and water and are able to give basic directions to a handful of villagers in order to help your tribe survive. Levels generally focus on one or two problems building up - an incoming flood, or an impending volcanic eruption - and require you to take action to protect your village from the same.\n\nThe game is, though, far too short.

The main story tries to fit in between levels and in bits that aren't shown as you play. The gameplay is amazing with water/lava/sand physics to make you ♥♥♥ that are just flawless. Really strategic the more you play and the power ups are never explained more past just what they're called and you have to figure out what some do by using them which is fine. You have no real enemies except the elements, but the villagers are a pain in what they accept as a path to walk on and a small amount of water can stop a village to be built. Lava never wants to build as much as it should and seems to just flatten what you put it on. Natural disasters are mainly just annoying but if left unchecked will destroy you. Sandbox mode is fine but you'll just put things to the extreme, big pile of sand or big lava spawning, and not really use it after that.

Such as picking up sand to block a wall of water, or sucking up some water so the uncontrollable villagers can make an uncontrollable village.\n\nBasic Gameplay: Once you make it safe, they will create this little outpost that generally gives you some kind of element manipulation buff such as evaporating all the water on the map. The outposts dont change at all. They only have to be protected from the elements. Your objective on every mission is to inhabit every outpost to proceed. Each mission has some sort of unique obstacle that sometimes requires thought to beat. Inbetween these missions you are  rewatching the same cinematic over and over. Thinking about it, it feels like an antfarm sim because you move elements around while you watch the ants do their own thing. Missions are easy. It is a good idea, 'meh' execution. Price should be somewhere around $10, $15 is steep. Pick it up on sale.

Even the steam version requires you to log into UPlay before launching for an extra un-wanted piece of DRM. As of December 2015 UPlay fails to load properly and consequently the game can't start, it looks like this has been an ongoing issue fora while now. There is a work around for this on the Steam forums but it's a pain to have to work through to play something which is already registered to Steam!!","December 8, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a lot of potential & is still fun when you get to the end game & can let your creative juices flow but, again, the map is way too small to make anything really decent. Even if there isn't a sequel, an expansion or some mods would be an excellent addition to the game. I would recommend this game but only barely as I am torn between the excellence of the concept and game play and the lack of it as well. It's sad that this game was just abandoned & left in the dust.","March 29","true","94.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haaaate uPay, but luckily I had no problems with it. (tip, try giving uPay administrator rights, it worked for me with windows 7 crashes, and with windows 8.1 it's been just smooth sailing with the bugger).\n\nAnyway I wish not to give a bad review to a good game because of the horrible DRM, which may have not even been the choice of the developers but forced on it by Ubisoft by default.\n\nMy only grief with the game was that it was very, very short and overall small. The campaign is done through in couple hours, and then you have bunch of very short challenge scenarios (don't trust my hours I tend to leave games open in the background). It lacks longer play scenarios and depth in many things, like the frequent discoveries don't really bring anything to the table, and there is _no_ long world building and evolving sandbox mode of proper type, part from maybe repeating levels of the campaign which are quite linear whatsoever, and the last bit free build if you really, really like just sculpting scenarios for no other purpose. I find it weird it is advertised as such.\n\nI could easily see myself going for ~100 hours with this game if they had extended it and gave it bit more depth, growing possibilities and more interaction in features. Alas, now you prolly get around 10h max out of it.\n\nConsidering how small the game is and not very new anymore it is a bit overpriced. However it truly was very enjoyable and I gulfed through it quickly and exitedly. Do give it a try if you have spare money, especially if it's on sale.","April 7","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Looks like the steam community bailed me out, they figured out a way to get uPlay to cooperate. Thanks guys! :)\n\nNow that I can safely say this is still working (uPlay is totally awful), I'm happy to report that this game is still as creative, beautiful and unique as it was in 2011. I've never played anything like it before or since. In fact, playing from dust when it first came out got me pretty interested in other simulation games like this, but none of them ever compared to what From Dust does.\n\nThe way you manipulate water in this game is really what does it for me. The way water flows, builds up, carries dirt, interacts with lava, surges in tides, gushes from holes in mountains, it's just all so well done and fascinating. I just spent an hour on the first level, watching water from two river sources carve out an enormous landmass from nothing.\n\nThis game is amazing, and it deserved far better than the treatment Ubisoft gave it. Bogging it down with uPlay basically condemned the game to a fate it didn't deserve.\n\nBut it really is an amazing game. I've never seen it on sale, but for $15 you're buying a pretty unique experience.\n\n<3 So glad I got it working again!","October 16, 2015","true","15.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
