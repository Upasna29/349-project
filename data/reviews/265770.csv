This game, I’m sorry, but unbearable to play. The controls are delayed and the shooting is terrible. Some of the ships don’t have shooting sounds, you cannot tell how close and/or far you are away from the enemy. This game is just bad. I’m sorry to the devs but this needs more polishing. It should have stayed as an Early Access game then I would at least be like, heyy, its still in Early Access, they have an excuse but nope, full release and so bad.

It's slow, controls are very weird, and it's obviously a "get it out the door" game. DO NOT BUY THE ELITE ACCOUNT. Give this game about a year before you even think about touching it.\n\nTrust me, I understand Early Access. But come on, a POS with in-game purchases should throw up a red flag. And for The 11th Doctor, did I say it was permanently broken? No, I said give it a year like most early access titles then try it out. Quit being a child. I have quite a few Early Access titles that I don't really touch unless it's been a while or BIG updates have hit the game. Like I said, I like the concept. It's original, but I feel it could do more than 2v2/4v4.

Burnalot","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057153349/","67 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis game isn't unfinished. It hasn't even properly begun.\n\nI understand what Early Access is. I understand what it's SUPPOSED to be doing.\n\nThis is not it. Not in the slightest.\n\nJust because Early Access allows you to put up a game that isn't fully complete DOES NOT mean you can post something like this. I understand the concept and, quite frankly, I love it. Haven't seen a proper space combat game since, what, Freelancer? And that was back in 2000. I feel the dev wants to make this a memorable experience, and that right there is a commendable initiative.\n\nHowever, that does not save the fact that this game is barely Beta. Hell, this is pretty much a proof of concept, nothing else. Sure, it's free, but the "Elite Account" is ridiculously expensive for a game like this, even more so than GUISE OF THE WOLF.\n\nNot even kidding. The Elite Account is more expensive than Guise of the Wolf. I'd rather play that for the Narm value if not for the fact that FUN Creators behaved like complete asses. But this? This game DOES NOT WARRANT a 14 euro Elite Account, especially not one that LOCKS MOST OF THE SHIPS. I'm sorry, WHAT?\n\nA free to play game, on Early Access, FAR AWAY from finished, and it has an Elite Account purchasable that allows you to use most of the ships available in-game. This SCREAMS cash-in, it really does. The game, as it stands, does not warrant the Elite Account, as I said.\n\nAs for the actual game...\n\nMenus: The options menu is pitiful, and is the first one I've seen that labels VSync as "Level 1" and "Level 2". I've tried both of them and quite honestly didn't notice any difference. You've got 2 mouse speed options, X and Y, which, again, tell you nothing. I assumed Y was vertical, but the actual game is completely 2D, so... what's it for?\nThe actual in-game menu is ridiculous. The Friends tab doesn't work. The Group tab doesn't work. The Lobby tab shows you the number of people... but not actually the people. It's basically empty UI space. Not to mention the fact that no one ever talks to anyone in the chat.\nAll in all, 5 buttons work in the menu: Tutorial, Skirmish, Options, Exit and the Elite Account purchase thingy. Hmm.\n\nTutorial: Jesus. Christ. The tutorial tells you nothing about the game. It's basically "Go here, hit this". It tells you movement... and that's it. I was left honestly confused at the end of it. I mean, what are cocoons? What are defenders, lane support? Not to mention that it was ridiculously easy to just skip past everything and destroy the enemy base IN 5 HITS. I mean, what?!\n\n(I'd like to note here that the game menu is bound to F10. Can't change it. What is this, 2007? ESCAPE, PEOPLE).\n\n(I'd also like to note that THIS GAME ONLY RUNS IN WINDOWED MODE, at least for Windows 7, and there seems to be no way to actually change that. Also no rebindable keys, yay).\n\nSkirmish: The current meat of the game. This is the one and only part that I'd say actually outright sucks rather than being unfinished. After spending 5 minutes in the queue with barely any information about players (besides a basic x/4, which makes no sense, as I ended up on a 3v3), I get into the game, only to find out that everyone was just standing at spawn, doing nothing. They weren't even afk, since when I sneaked into the enemy's spawn, they attacked me. They were literally just standing there, probably confused about the whole thing because, again, THIS GAME DOESN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING.\n\nMechanics: Overly simplistic. Left click for basic attacks, you can purchase abilities that automatically bind themselves to the number keys. I'd like to note that the upgrade shop is actually quite interesting, and ships do seem to have specific abilities available. Nothing new, but still nice.\nI have no idea how to play this game, because I couldn't bother to play it long enough to learn. Maybe a mode where you fight AI, and an improved Tutorial (look at LoL) could make this better.\n\nMap: I played this ONCE. Again, ONCE. The map is... I have no idea what to say. The game is completely 2D, which is REALLY odd for a space combat game, and as such everything on the map is on the same plane (except maybe for that... thing in the middle. Which I have no idea WHAT it is). I really, really, really totally freakin' like the fact that you can go across the boundaries of the map and start taking damage because of it (sarcasm, by the way). I've seen that in many games. NEVER IN A MOBA.\nAs for the actual map elements... No idea what to say. Game tells you nothing. Confusing as hell.\n\n(I'd like to note here that this game runs like ♥♥♥. It's permanently locked to 30.1 frames, for some forsaken reason, and if you hit the Alt button to get some very basic enemy indicators, THE FRAMERATE IS HALVED. WHAT? WAT?!)\n\nGraphics: Overall, look kinda nice. I've seen worse textures in much more expensive games (I mean AAA expensive). However... the game looks barren. You've essentially got a handful of things floating around, not moving, asteroids and ice chunks that you can destroy... And that's it. They look pretty, but ultimately useless. The backgrounds are nice, but waaaaaaay too colourful.\n\n(I'd also like to note that you can freely clip through the shop. And if you aim the camera properly, you can see the interior of the model, I... whatever)\n\nFinal Opinion: This game needs SERIOUS work, and should not be on Steam like this, especially not with a 14 euro Elite Account that LOCKS AWAY FREE USERS FROM MOST OF THE SHIPS. This is THE most blatant pay-to-win game I have ever seen, and that ♥♥♥♥ should be fixed.\n\nFor some shameless whoring, here's my video on the whole thing: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qs2TT4vwrk","February 22, 2014","false","1.5"," 18 of 24 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","18","24","0","0"

Outside of the WASD movement and space (sometimes) to attack, absolutely none of the controls are intuitive and you can't even look them up in game, let alone remap them. There's no graphics settings outside of enabling vsync and a crippling glitch that makes the graphics not even appear if running the game windowed (which is the default and has to be done with windows keyboard commands because, again, no graphics settings.) The gameplay itself, while there is an almost useless tutorial, is rather obtuse considering the simplicity of the concept behind MOBA's. The tutorial itself, in fact, seemed to lie as it told me if i destroyed an enemy hive it would then allow my drones (or whatever they call creeps) to attack the enemy base, or I could do it myself to expidite the process, however i never noticed my own creeps ever doing anything at all.\n\nTL;DR Could be interesting but they've got a long way to go to even have a decent game on their hands. And unless there are some major, major overhauls, I wouldn't spend a dime on this game and am glad I didn't. Stick with your DOTA2, LoL, etc.","February 17, 2014","false","1.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

If you are trying to enter the MOBA market, this game is a prime example of what not to do upon its release. When first released it was too buggy to play, there were constant skipping issues and frame rate drops. Even the tutorial had those issues, can you believe that? The third time I tried to play it, a few weeks later, upon entering the battle my ship selection screen ended up glitched over the actual game, with no feasible way to get it to go away. There is such a small selection of ships, with no other choices besides upgrading your account, already you can see this game is probably going to be pay to win.

But i don't like the look of the ships but thats personal so don't take that a long with you, The main reason i don't recogment this game is everything is clunky. As in the main fighter stops like a luxury cruiser and doesn't feel fast. The cap ships look nice tho but don't really feel that they can protect you and most of the time they don't really cause the spam aoe.\n\nThe skills are well thought up but they don't tell what the effects are you need to be in a shop to do that. Well nobody has time in a moba to read the skills so a mouse over is better in the main HUD while you are flying the ship.\n\nWhat I did like is that the asteroids can be mined for experience points thats new and I liked it.\n\nAnyways  my verdict is: nice concept go for it dev team, but for consumers a big fat nope, a not now, not soon maybe in a year or so. I'd rather play ACM or X rebirth 10 min. after release then this","February 5, 2014","false","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The biggest fault I had was just being completely lost in what anything was, whether a power worked, what terrain had impact or could no clip into, and why my team would win the match or lose with no indication on any of these even though there are progress indication bars at the top of the screen.\n\nSometimes the combat would work; mostly no as I couldn't tell you if you need to actually aim at enemy or if weapons attack random targets.\n\nThe biggest thing is that this game isn't just bad it is disappointing as the theme of space and fighters isn't well utilized when the field is only flat with no vertical movement.

Lots of space to cover from one end to the other, but super slow ships to cover it. Extremely boring. Oh, and none of the "hundreds of ships" are available to you unless you become an "elite" member. This game isn't actually F2P. It's a trial. And a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ one that doesn't make me want to buy their game.","February 7, 2014","false","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The biggest fault I had was just being completely lost in what anything was, whether a power worked, what terrain had impact or could no clip into, and why my team would win the match or lose with no indication on any of these even though there are progress indication bars at the top of the screen.\n\nSometimes the combat would work; mostly no as I couldn't tell you if you need to actually aim at enemy or if weapons attack random targets.\n\nThe biggest thing is that this game isn't just bad it is disappointing as the theme of space and fighters isn't well utilized when the field is only flat with no vertical movement.  This game could literally be horses and carts and it would still be the same thing failing to use the strongest aspect of this concept.\n","August 26, 2014","false","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No other players, just me vs AI and I am getting lag? The only explination is that the game is horribly unoptimized and buggy.\n\nFrom what I understand this game is no longer in early access, which would indicate that it is at a full release version... it still feels very much like a beta game and not a finished project.

No other players, just me vs AI and I am getting lag? The only explination is that the game is horribly unoptimized and buggy.\n\nFrom what I understand this game is no longer in early access, which would indicate that it is at a full release version... it still feels very much like a beta game and not a finished project. It needs more polish and better optimization.\n\nI will definitely keep an eye on this one as I said I really want to like it, but right now I just dont think its reached its potential.

Pretty stupid!\n\nThey need to learn Unity 5, first, do a couple of export to Linux and other platforms before they come back to this game to start from scratch, they need a full reboot because from what I've seen on Microsoft Windows, it's a complete and total disaster. Well, at least it works on that platform, even though it hobbles.\n\nI sent in an error report about this many months ago to have this fixed, they said they would hand it off to their "Unity programmer", I can see he/she didn't do a think for Linux nor even fix the project.\n\nSad, very sad!","June 14, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think maybe that person wasnt paying attention...or maybe he got bugged. This game is very appealing from the videos; very easy on the eyes. There is just nobody online.\n\nAs was also said in a recent review the game can be played with a minimum of two people. I would love to try this game out. If there is anyone that reads this and would like to give it a go....Message me and we can play a match.\n\nNote to the DEVS:\n\nIf you made it possible to play with nothing more than bots the game would likely game a crowd (again?). I know i'll be here. Once there is a crowd, the reviews can actually start to help you guys.\n\nThank you for your hard work....hopefully the Long Holiday, lol, will have helped you guys to get back to work.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nOn a second note: I had to use the game five minutes to post this....i had three when i wrote above, but it was worth it to me to have a couple extra minutes to get my opinion out there","January 17","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
