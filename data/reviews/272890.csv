Vertiginous Golf (I will refer to it as VG for the rest of my review) is set in the skies above Scudburough in a floating city called New Lun-Donne. Those who live in Scudburough, such as your fine self, can visit Verti-Sphere shops where you can get a temporary fix of verti-golf in the clouds high above.\n\n+Nice graphics\n+Cool dystopian steam-punk world design\n+54 holes included with the game, each hole is very well designed and there's a good variation of difficulty across all courses\n+An integrated course editor so you can make your own courses\n+A few different course types\n+You can take control of a robotic bird to scout out the track and look for the best way forward\n+A cool 'free stroke' mechanic which involves you getting the ball in a certain whole to get that stroke free and move you to a different part of the course\n+Cool rewind function, it's not unlimited which leaves the game a good level of challenge, rewind fuel can be restored by taking shots\n+Simple controls (I played with a 360 controller)\n+Good soundeffects and nice soundtrack\n+Singleplayer and Multiplayer both local and online\n\n+/-No predicted path for the ball, personally I would have liked to have seen it be at least an option\n+/-There aren't many railings on the courses so you're gonna lose your ball over the side often\n\n-Awful voice acting, it's all very bland and uninteresting\n-Uninteresting story which isn't helped by the afore mentioned voice acting\n-Only two clubs to choose from\n-The ball feels a bit too bouncy for my liking which makes it even easier for balls to go over the edge\n\nVerdict:\n7.5\n\nA fun dystopian steam-punk mini-golf game with nice graphics, cool world design, loads of courses, an integrated course editor and some cool mechanics.

The game controls aren't difficult to grasp, the music and sounds are well designed, and the interface is nice and clean, not interfering with the graphics -- did I mention they were gorgeous?  Oh, yes, I did.\n\nThe hummingbird and rewind features are welcome additions to the basic gameplay of minigolf.  In fact, given the complexity of some of the holes, they're requirements.  The availability of a wedge in addition to a putter is welcome, adding a level of strategy absent in other minigolf games.\n\nThe game is also eminently playable -- on the more advanced courses, there are several ways to play each hole, so there's little repetition even with the limited number of courses.  If it has a boredom factor, I haven't reached it yet.\n\n\nThe Bad\nWhile I have not identified the game's boredom factor, it does have a frustration factor, and it was found quite quickly.\n\nThere are difficult holes.  There are even diabolical holes -- the par 3 8th at OSU Scarlet, when the pin is set in that card-table sized tongue of green sticking out into the pond, comes to mind as a real-world example.\n\nVertiginous Golf, unfortunately, includes a few unplayable holes, where the line between success and failure is both unmarked and razor thin.  The penalty for failure is vastly out of proportion to the value of success -- and scores rapidly balloon out of control, rendering an entire round not much more than an exercise in futility.  And if I want futility, I can just load up my clubs and go play some real golf (which can fairly be described as two shots worthy of Tiger hidden within one hundred twenty worthy of Tigger).\n\nOn the plus side, this is the worst I have to say about Vertiginous Golf -- but since it's central to game play, it's of importance.\n\n\nThe Skinny\nOverall, I'll give 7.5/10, though I would strongly recommend the designers re-visit some of the holes and dial it back a little.  I don't expect an ace every time, but neither do I expect to be condemned to ten or more strokes because I missed a tee shot by the faintest of margins.\n\nOn the cosmetic side, I'd like to suggest allowing the player to choose their ball color (or if that's already in the game, making it more obvious as I haven't found it yet).  We golfers are a superstitious lot, and I (think I) play better with a blue or green ball than with a red one.  :D\n\nA course designer would be another welcome addition -- way back in ancient times (i.e., the 1990s), the Jack Nicklaus series of golf games always included course design tools, and some of the fan-made courses were genuinely brilliant.  The vast array of additional free content also kept the JN games playable far longer than most other games released at the same time.\n\nOverall, this game is Recommended on the basis of design and creativity, and in the hopes that some of its frustration factor is ironed out by the time of its official release.","September 14, 2014","true","14.0"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","28","31","0","0"

Vertiginous Golf, is not only  beautiflul  to look at , it's deviously more difficult to  score compared to  the older mini golf game.  With local coop available now; and,   as development progresses  with   up to 4 player multiplayer this is going to be a great game to play with your online mates.  I can imagine the laugh your all going to have playing this.\n\nThe game is in early access;  if you were lucky enought to buy it via the humble store    a few days ago, you'd have  got it  for half price, right up to its release.\n\nThe game is a physics based first person exploratory mini golf game  set in a steampunk  universe.  There are loads of  innovations  included such as first person mechanical humming bird that can be utilized to plan your shots, there' s a rewind facility that allows  you to  undo or rewind a shot without losing a stroke (basically a cheat system).  The ball can also be controlled  using the WASD keys, so  rewinding part way, you can then adjust your shot accordingly.  There's a whole host of other  things  included  such as moving obstacles,    mini helicopters, blockers,  platforms, spinners, travelators and other   interesting  items (eg  a glowing semi transparent  trail showing you   your previous shots)  that  help or hinder your progress.  At the moment there are 18 holes with   a further 27 + holes planned in future updates.\n\nAs an early access game  you can report bugs in the  games forums HERE.\n\nYou can see  videos  of game play HERE,   HERE   and HERE.\n\nHighly recommended even at it's full price of £11.99 ($14.99).  That's over £3 cheaper  if you can find a friend in the US to gift it too you.  ;)\n","March 8, 2014","true","3.5"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","24","31","0","5"

I have played them through my childhood, but as an adult, I had slacked off. Then--*Gasp*--What do my eyes see? I new mini-golf game on steam! I immediately got it and was thrilled to play it, even at the price point.\n\nAnd the second point is simply this; How dare you expect me to enjoy this heap of junk.\n\nThe controls are the wonkiest thing on the planet, I feel like I have no kind of control over the ball whastsoever. There is nowhere near enough railing, I found myself constantly falling off of the platforms for no other reason than my putter flinched a little harder than I told it--tried to tell it to.\n\nIn the story, the concept with the records advancing the plot and rewarding you if you do is really neat. However, making it mandatory to make the hole isn't. I had made it to the end of a hole, after, oh I don't know, 15 storkes because the ball forgot how to stay on the platform, and finally made it to the raised recepticle where the ball was thanks to a "free stroke" hole (that just sounds dirty). I was thrilled I had finally made it, only to discover that I missed a record. I couldn't get out. I had to restart the hole because a metal tube spat me out at a point where I couldn't go back. Also, this happened on three different holes.\n\nAnd don't get me started on how bad the Swing Power system is. You could pull the club to the same height three times and get three totally different swings. Oh, And the ball itself! Oh golly gee wilikers, that ball. I have lost more strokes because my ball bounced off of the cup and into the abyss than I care to count. It doesn't matter how slow the ball is going, if I can't just barely nudge it in, it goes flying out and 5 meters away, usually into the abyss. It's unbelieveable. And I'm NOT going to star in on the awful, twitchy camera.\n\nSummary\nIt may sound like I am just bad at the game and complaining about it, but I have a feel for how a game like this should work. And, frankly, something isn't working here. This game is trying to be something that it just isn't quite yet. Now, I know, what you're thinking, "Hey, Joe! Give the Devs a break, the game has been in 1.0 for literally three days!" I know that. I have a lot of games that are still in development in my library. I know how tedious a game can be for the first few months until they patch it up and give it its lolly. So, don't get me wrong, I am still excited to play this game. Just... not right now. My keyboard may need a bandage first.\n\nSo, until the game is fixed a little bit, I can't and won't recomend it. But, the second those updates happen(they ARE going to happen, right?), I will be chomping at the bits, ready to play. And then I will gladly, openly, and, perhaps even lovingly change my review, but until then, I almost refuse to play it.\n\nUntil next time (There WILL be a next time, right?);\nCheers,\nSuPeR_J03","May 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 168 of 288 people (58%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","58","168","288","30","12"

The game couples relaxing music and visuals with golfing and physics puzzle based gameplay. The world is fantastical and steampunk, this is not a game for someone looking for a legitimate golf sim type of game.\n\nVertiginous Golf comes with a level creator as well! You can share these custom courses with other players custom course menu.  You can even play these courses in the online multiplayer. A few other things to note are the neat interactive menus in the game, and the character customization, both are neat additions and not something I would expect coming into a game like this.\n\nI can freely say that I have not played much of Vertiginous yet, but  I enjoy the gameplay it offers. I haven't tried much of multiplayer but the population seems to be fairly small, its not surprising since I had not heard of this game until it was offered free for a day.

How you do this is completely up to you, do you try and smash it across the whole field, hoping to get some lucky rebounds? Maybe you’re a bit more conservative and like to go for the paths which are enclosed? Maybe you want that “hole-in-one” every time and you have to pitch perfectly in order to get it. Also did I mention this game is as hard as 7 week old bacon?\n\nVertiginous Golf is overflowing with options, which is something you wouldn’t normally see from a game which is tied to a sport. Just on originality alone I think this is a good pick-up. It already has great features while in Early Access and promised future developments look even better. I’d only steer away from this if you have ADD and you need fast hot action all over your face in order to feel satisfied, now go clean yourself up.","March 6, 2014","true","2.6"," 43 of 72 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","43","72","0","0"

I have to put that between brackets because although this is more or less traditional mini-golf, it doesn't look or feel like it at all. Imagine playing minigolf on islands in the sky with twisted, devious and brilliant courses in a steam-punk world remeniscent of Bioshock Infinite.\n\nFrom the moment you start this game up and are greeted with one of the most innovative and immersive menu systems I have ever seen in a computer game you know you are in for something special.\n\nAs of writing the game is feature complete and I have not noticed any bugs, there are two courses of 9 holes and a training hole. So don't let the Early Acces label scare you off, this is the first EA game I have purchased and I am glad I did. Appart from adding about 30 more holes and tweaking this game could be considered finished.\n\nOh did I mention this game was rock-hard? Don't be surprised to get 20, 30 or even 40 over par on your first attempts at a hole. Getting the first hole in one is going to be an epic challenge.\n\nThis is obviously a labour of love, the passion the developers have put into this project shines through in every aspect of Vertiginous Golf. You owe it to yourself to give this a shot if you are intrigued, because this is one of the better examples of video games being art without being pretentious. The stylish design and gameplay blend together perfectly and it never feels contrived.\n\nI highly recommend this to anybody looking for a beautiful, relaxing but also very challenging experience.","June 30, 2014","true","2.2"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","2"

When I first started playing this game, I got very frustrated with it very quickly. Over time, I learned some of the different features it has to offer, so I experimented with some of these other features before returning to the base part of the game.\n\nWhen you first start playing this game, you have a few different options. There are various 1 player modes, as well as multi player modes to choose from. I started by playing the regular mini putt holes, and worked my way up to playing these holes with the multi player mode. I will say, the holes get drastically more difficult and complex as you move on. Sometimes, in my opinion, the par the holes are set at can be unreasonable, but with that aside, the holes do range in difficulties.\n\nThis game also gives you a build your own hole option, which I found to be rewarding, because I could take some of my frustrations out that I had with the game, on the self created holes. Some of the obstacles I previously found aggravating and just downright cruel, became amusing in the close to impossible holes I created for myself.\n\nNOTE: I got this game for free during a special event, so I recommend this game when it is on sale for a low price. If I were to have actually spent a chunk of change on this game, I would have rated it differently. As I mentioned before, MANY of the holes built into this game leave you asking yourself  “how is it even possible to get it in that many strokes?” or “this hole isn’t even fair!” As I stated earlier in my review however, I changed my attitude with this game because I play it now more as a humorous experiment, instead of a serious challenge.","January 8","true","6.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","2"

Why can't it be the scale of regular golf, so I'm putting through three hundred yards of bumpers and windmills and rollercoasters? Also, why can't mini-golf have lots of mechanical hummingbirds?\n\nObviously, we've all asked these questions. Now Vertiginous Golf is here to answer them.\n\nIt's insanity, but it all works well. It's fun and polished, especially for a tiny indy production like this one. The multiplayer is the star of the show. Charming and imaginative describe virtually every inch of what exists in Vertiginous Golf.\n\nMy only real complaint is lack of content. It needs more courses. Partly, that's Early Access. But, the future goals say the final game will have 45+ courses, and it will need to be double that, at least, because it IS miniature golf. Real golf is about honing nuances. Miniature golf, at any scale, is far more dependent on novelty factor. As cool and robust as these course designs are, they're not anything you're going to play fifty or a hundred times. The game needs so many holes that by the time you finish the final holes, you can no longer remember the early holes clearly. That's the only way this will ever be anything more than an incredibly cool way to spend an evening or two. The only way this will ever be a real game.\n\nMy hope is that this will turn into a more expensive game, with far, far more content, instead of remaining a cheap game which inevitably starts pushing the edges of its content after just a few hours. At the moment, it reminds me a lot of the disc golf sector of the ps3 game Sports Champions - BRILLIANT, but give me more of it. A *lot* more of it.","October 10, 2014","true","7.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Despite the cons other reviews mentioned, it does well what it was designed to do: a minigolf game. The holes are sometimes more complex than it should be, but that's the fun of it. When you play with friends, an inaccurate stroke could send your ball to "how am I supposed to get to the hole now?!", which will give you and yours friends a very hilarious time toghether. That alone makes it worth buying this game for a few fun local-coop sessions, not to mention the online part (multiplayers and level builder, which I haven't tried yet).\n\nHonestly, I just want to pull more people into this game to creat more holes for me to play XD","October 28, 2015","true","3.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It'll probably not be on the list even if the list was 30 minigolf games. But this game, this "minigolf" game is something much more, something that's hard to figure it out at first glance.\n\nIf you're playing this game, or planning to play this game, or maybe you even finished the game and have or haven't figure out the deeper part of the game, then that probably means you've played a lot of minigolf games. This isn't the kind of game that someone who's not a fan of minigolf games would play, most people would just look at it, go "huh" and move on.\nSo if you're not one of those "lucky"could someone who's first minigolf game to be this one called lucky? Would they just play all the courses and miss the true purpose of this game? Can those people called lucky? Maybe they are, for them to not have the same fate as me, not knowing what this game contains. Maybe they are lucky to not have their minds filled with regrets and thoughts about this mad, dysfunctional society we live in few who stumbled upon this game, then that probably means you're a veteran minigolf game player and you've probably played all the big titles like 3D Ultra Minigolf and Planet Minigolf or maybe even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org].

Well if you think this game is like 3D Ultra Minigolf, Planet Minigolf or even this classic browser minigolf game[www.whyy.org] then you're right, it's just another minigolf game, and if you like minigolf (like me) then do give this a try.

More like Pretentious Golf. OR Bioshock Golf: The Game. I'm unsure if I can adequately express quite how much the characters in this game love hearing themselves talk. You play as a silent protagonist playing golf via virtual reality projection of a sort to play on floating platforms in the sky. The story is all told by rambling characters who spent 3 hours poring over a thesaurus for the most ostentatious way of saying anything at all. At first, it was charming, but after about 2 hours of it, I was dreadfully tired of it, but to attempt to follow the plot, you have to listen to the recordings which you gain by touching them with your golf ball. I wound up having a friend stream to watch me play just under the last half of the game, and she found the people prattling on even more annoying than I did.\n\nThat said, this is actually a pretty good game. It's a steampunk floating mini golf course where you can occasionally rewind bad swings, use contraptions in the environment to get your ball where you want it to go, and use a club that lets you hit in a straight line, or one that lets you make it come up off of the ground strategically. I'll be honest: I was absolute rubbish at this game. I had more than 40 swings on a par 4 level, and the last half of the game I was doing absolutely miserably at it on a regular basis. Despite all of that, I had fun. I'm glad this game was made, even if the characters drone on a bit more than I found enjoyable. This is far from the type of game I would normally ever play, but I picked it up on the cheap as part of a Humble Bundle. I do recommend this game, though I would say $5.00 should be the most a person ought to pay for it, if that much.

We got it after the multiplayer update and have had a blast messing around it. The singleplayer and multiplayer have multiple options for you to choose from. So you can either make it challenging for yourself by removing the bug influencer, playing on a only green map, or if with your friends play with weapons.\n\nThere are also multiple ways to play the multiplayer matches. So far from what I've played they have a regular golf match (9 holes) and they have a race type. Now typically for the regular match it's kind of like a race but you can go at your own pace. My friends and I personally like to take turns and whatnot but you can play however you want.\n\nSo I haven't put as many hours into this game as some of the other people here, but I LOVE this game. Just because you play a course doesn't mean you can't go back and play it again. With how the holes are setup, there are multiple ways about getting to your goal. So if you mess up, keep going, and come back some other time and try to beat your score on how you did it before. There are just so many possibilities.\n\nNow this game is currently in Early Access but it's still a great game for where it is at. So here are some Pros and Cons that I have come to find about this game.\n\nPros:\n-Replay Value (a ton, I really don't see how I could run out of options especially if Steam Community gets involved)\n-Lovely Graphics (freaking beautiful)\n-Some minor customization on your playing style (no bug influence, yes/no weapons)\n-Very smooth gameplay (I play on Splendid graphics and framerate is great)\n-Easy concepts to grasp (Left mouse camera, right mouse shoot) (there is more but you get the picture)\n-Online Multiplayer (little buggy but whatever, still cool)\n-Hilarious to laugh at friends as you explode their ball into oblivion (bombs are awesome. You can explode their ball out of the hole)\n-Nine 9 hole courses so far (increases in difficulty each one)\n-Button customization (don't like how it's setup? No prob, set it to what you want)\n-8 player multiplayer (freaking 8. I haven't had that many friends on here yet but seriously, imagine the chaos of 8 people placing traps for others. Huehuehuehue)\n\nCons:\n-Online Multiplayer Servers:\nEverytime you go to multiplayer you search a region to play in. For some reason it has it set to Europe as default for me when I live in the US. I would like to click on US and search for things there, but it has to search for every game in the regions, which could take some time, stalling for even longer. So if there was a way to have a choice on which region you want to play would be nice.\n-Online Multiplayer Options:\nYes you have a lot of options to choose from, and that is awesome, BUT, if you try to change the course instead of repeating the level, you might accidentally mess up and have to restart the hosted game.\n-Online Multiplayer Lobby:\nI love the fact that you can create your own lobby, it's cool, but you don't have many options in your lobby. Your lobby is always public, so anyone can join. Which is sometimes irritating if I'm waiting for my friends to join. So they join whatever, you can ask them to leave, but they don't always. So you have to restart the lobby. Why? Because you have no kick option.\n-Weapon selection:\nThis is kind of minor but I wish there was a way to choose your weapon with a specific button rather then having to press 'c' 4 times to get what I want. Maybe I can select how I want to set it up and I'm being stupid. I haven't explored all the button options yet, but I haven't seen any options for it.\n-Camera:\nIt's pretty good for the most part, but sometimes you get stuck near a pole and can't see where you are trying to put. Other games have fixed this by making those see through but everything is solid, so on the rare occasion if you get stuck, you kind of have to hope you hit it to the right spot because you can't see.\n\nYes I have some issues with the online multiplayer, but I can't blame the developers, this option just came out October 6th so I don't expect this feature to be perfect, there are some things anyone/anything can improve on.\n\nThere are also some other features that they said they plan on bringing to the game later on. Such as a LOT more customization. Avatars, Putters, Golf Balls, and Levels. Freaking Levels. They said they plan on bringing in Steam Community to this game. Players from all around will be creating their own levels with the level customization will be used (they plan on bringing that and hopefully will). There is so much they can do with this game, I'm just so excited to see what they will do.\n\nSo long story short, this game rocks my socks off. I love mini golf in real life and this game really only limits people to their imagination. I hope to see this game keep going and come out with all the features they plan on.\n\nTL;DR - Den outta Den","October 9, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I had fun with my girls and GF.\n\nHowever: The interface for setting up and starting your round of golf, is unnessary and confusing.\n\nProduction Value is barebones. You get a Birdy, and NOTHING. Not even a sound effect. Par? Same. Win the round? Same. You get nothing.

It's a minigolf game with a really cool fantasy-esque atmosphere and neat little contraptions all over. You build up power with swings and can use either a rewind button or a little jet thingie on your ball to move it slightly where you want. At first it seems like rewind is incredibly OP but the game gets fairly challenging and fairly fast. To the point it might even get a bit frustrating to some people. Luckily I was playing it with my girlfriend so I did honestly have a good time watch us both screw up a few times. The game's got pretty good graphics and a neat art style and is surprisingly not too computer intensive too.\n\nIt also has online now which they just added. I don't know if I'll do that myself as I'm more content with local, but it's cool to have the option to play with friends. Apparently has weapons and other fun junk if you want.\n\nAnother reason I really enjoyed this game. The devs are really cool and seem to be very active even in the steam forums. I had a glitch that didn't allow me to play local multiplayer and made a thread here. The devs worked with me on it and in just a day they released a patch to fix it. That's something you don't see too often when it comes to early access and other junk and is certainly a breath of fresh air.\n\nI will admit the game is a tad big buggy and has the occasional physics or weird clipping bug, but its kind of hard to stay mad at it when it's an early access game. I expect it to be ironed out as time goes on. The devs were very open with what their update schedule is and what their plans are and have so far done what they said.\n\nAnyways, it's just a really nice mini golf game. If you want to play a nice relaxing (or a fairly challenging) game of minigolf you should really give it a shot. even though it is early access, it's a fun enough game even as it is right now and even goes on sale fairly often.\n\nits just fun ok. devs were swell and is looks cool. Not expensive either. Thanks ilu","October 9, 2014","true","10.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","5"

You know that feeling in Mario Kart when you fall off the edge? Well you'll get that feeling in this game a lot.

I've played through each course a couple times now and I'm still having a lot of fun. I will say that the hole layouts are a bit confusing. These aren't par 3-4 holes! The complexity is slightly annoying at first but adds to the replay value. It's been fun for me to realize "secrets" to getting the best path through a hole.\n\nThe shot strength is another mechanic that you just have to get used to. After my couple hours of play I am now pretty certain of how far my shots will go.\n\nThere is plenty of help in this game, easing the difficulty level down. There is a flashback feature to redo shots. There is also an aftertouch to sway the ball after hitting it. There will apparently later be a hardcore mode with those disabled if you find it too easy.\n\nThe atmosphere and genre of the game is great. The music is calming and the atmosphere serene.\n\nI'm very excited for the future course editor and new courses. The developers seem very active in the forums and seem to greatly value the community. I have faith that this game will get expanded in the ways that they say it will and it is pretty fun now to hold me over!","March 8, 2014","true","12.3"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

And that says a lot. In addition it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. If you enjoyed minigolf games back in the late 1990's at your work computer or while at school then this is the game for your current self and mind. You will not be dissapointed.

Not something I'd personally spend hours with, but nice enough to forget about the world for a few minutes to an hour every now and then. Not so sure about the price (R$19,99) and I fail to see the appeal for the gold pack, but seems like something a group of friends could benefit from.","November 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

So far the story mode is annoying me a little but since this is supposed to be more than just putt putt golf I will listen to it.  I would say for some they would need to mute this to enjoy the game but the thing is the option is there to get rid of all the sounds you want.  In regards to content it seems there is quite a bit of it with the story mode, multiplayer and the content created holes or courses.  I think with this creation mode it definitely gives the game more life as in you'll have more reason to play it in the many years ahead.  So with that all said anyone that likes putt putt golf and is ok with having a twist to it get this game.","November 8, 2015","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As I loaded up the game, however, I ran into some problems.  The game automatically mapped the controls to a joystick I had plugged in, and I spun around uncontrollably.  "Okeydoke," I said, "I'll just rebind the controls!"  Oh, dear reader, was that ever a mistake.  By the time I was done, I had a completely unplayable game on my hands.  I didn't even have the option to reset the controls to default, and I was lost.\nI was fully prepared to give up on this game, and move on to the next game on my backlog... but I decided to throw up a halfhearted message about my predicament on the steam community boards.  I was TOTALLY BLOWN AWAY when one of the developers replied in an hour, gave a solution, and explained the problem!\nI've been golfing for about 3 hours now, and I've enjoyed every second.  There is a story mode and deep running narrative throughout the game that is a true pleasure to discover.  The tale is told in a somewhat odd, disjointed, rambling way which I've decided matches the setting perfectly.  The minigolfing aspect is sometimes referred to as "dark souls minigolf" in the threads, due to the complexity and challenge.  The art and music are patently strange and elaborate.  I've only played the single player so far, but I look forward to sharing the multiplayer with some friends soon!","May 11, 2015","true","3.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

One of us always hits a bug where they can't take a shot, can't reset their shot, and can't bring up the menu to quit the hole.  Camera controls still work, can still chat and watch other players shoot, etc.  The only solution we have is to alt + F4 and start over again.  Until we are able to finish a round there's no way I can recommend someone else buy this.","November 5, 2015","false","1.8"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","46","6","13","0","0"

In this game the graphics are busy, blurry and hard on the eyes. I had to lower graphic effects to make it somewhat comfortable viewing. The sound and music are dull. The ball physics aren't great and the ball doesn't stay in the hole so that removes any satisfaction of puttting the ball. When you do complete a hole there's an annoying steam machine bouncing in your view. I only played a few holes but the courses got complicated quickly with wind machines, ramps and conveyors. It was not enjoyable and quickly became a stressful gameplay experience than a relaxing one so unlikely I will return to play any more of it.","November 10, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

What else is there in a minigolf game?\n\nOn the positive side, I really never seen a minigolf game done so extravagantly, the graphics are great for its genre, and the themes is really out of place, at least for a minigolf game, that is. That's a very risky and very bold move from the developers, and I should say I really like it.\n\nHowever, controls will take a while to get use too, and seems that this game is built from ground up to play with controllers (xbox 360 in this case). Mouse & keyboard are kinda wonky.\n\nAlso optimizations are not really good, since I don't get satisfactory framerate on my i7 PC.\n\nConclusion? If you like golf with a twist, this probably for you.\n\nFor me, I should say this is just not my cup of tea. However, I would recommend it to those who love this genre tho specially those who wanted something really new, and out of place.\n\nSo yeah.

I skipped the story, and had no idea there was one until i read other reviews. The game itself is pretty awesome. i like it a lot.\n\nSetting:\nSteampunk minigolf.\n\nThe controls:\nNot bad. many people are complaining but it's very simple. left click and move to rotate/move camera, scroll to zoom in/out. hold right click and move back to adjust power and then let go to swing and hit the ball. I have had no problems with the controls, they all seem pretty natural to me.\nPlus, you get to scout ahead with a steam machine bird so you can plan your shots better.\n\nThe railings:\nyeah.. that's one where i have a slight problem with. There are a lack of railings in the game, so many times my ball will fly off of the map. the levels themselves are pretty awesome though. always challenging in one way or another.\n\nThe Ball:\nkind of bouncy. it's like a ping pong ball.\n\nThe Golf Clubs:\n"you only get to choose from two" - it's minigolf man. you only need one.\n\noverall:\n7.5/10 - I'd recommend the game for anyone who enjoys minigolf games.","October 28, 2015","true","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/recommended/272890/","colonsimulator","Hippo Turtle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/colonsimulator/","1772 products in account","I understand that this golf game is supposed to take place in a steampunk setting and the overall presentation does lend itself to that aim. The problem is that this premise also gets in the way (for me) of enjoying a golf experience that is very much flawed in every aspect. Playing Vertiginous Golf hardly feels like I'm playing a golf game. While the physics engine is serviceable, the holes and their gimmicks simply get in the way of what golf or mini golf are supposed to feel like. Traversing each hole is cumbersome and awkward. The alternative-style (steampunk?) obstacles scattered throughout each hole just aren't interesting, nor do they add anything new and worthwhile to the golfing experience. There's also very little content and each hole is very similar to the next. Yes, there is the opportunity to create your own holes and to play through holes created by the community but they honestly all look, feel and play the same. This is a less than ambitious golf game with little to no variety. I would rather play PGA Tour Golf for DOS, which was released in 1990.\n\nVertiginous Golf is mediocre.","April 8","false","0.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/272890/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Steampunk mini-golf. Roll that around in your head for a moment. What does that even mean? Are the holes peppered with gears and pneumatic devices? Is your golfer dressed in a cast-iron top hat and useless multi-colored goggles? Does the course look like a dungeon from Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura? The answer is way less interesting than any of that, and it's a concept bolted onto a pretty mediocre golf game to begin with.\n\nBooting the game drops you directly into the barren, rain-soaked streets of some Victorian ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ town. The shop in front of you lets you select a mini-golf course high in the clouds to experience, and then literally zaps you in the brain to transport your consciousness there. Up in the sky, you putt your way around various 9-hole courses with no continuity between holes; each is floating off on its own in a sea of clouds. There are no NPCs, no clever signs or environments, and no real indication of a world outside that first street and your orbiting golf holes. I admit the stark intro makes good on their "dystopian" feel mentioned on the store page, but... why? Why make a mini-golf game feel cold and uninviting? And why do nothing with that on the actual holes?\n\nThe only indication that you are playing steampunk golf on said actual holes are the occasional conveyors, tubes, and fans. Other than that, it's trails and ramps of astroturf, arranged in overly-complicated ways. Vertiginous Golf's main problem is that all its holes are too sprawling, with too many traps. There are conveyors that take your ball away from the hole, fans that blow it off ledges, ramps that lead nowhere, and entire levels of vertical holes designed to punish you. A perfect example is the Extra Stroke holes, special side holes on some greens that take a stroke off your score if you sink them. But you have a limited number of putts to get to them and they tend to be arranged in trap locations, so if you don't make it in time, your score on that hole is boned. There are rewind and reset functions for individual shots but they're overly restrictive, meaning if you don't use them the moment you think you might be in trouble, it's probably too late.\n\nThere's a shop next to the golf one, where you can buy all kinds of clothes and gaudy clubs for your golfer using the money you earn vertiginously golfing. These can earn you money bonuses to... buy more clothes. Aesthetically they're pointless, because your golfer is invisible on the course! Limited to just the cash bonuses, the unlocks feel tacked-on and mostly useless, much like the steampunk theme and dystopian airs. If Vertiginous Golf was a good golf game, with interesting and fun holes to navigate, I could overlook the senseless trappings, but sadly that's the last thing you're going to get here.","November 17, 2015","false","1.2"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","46","12","26","2","1"

Leaving the character customization would cause my game to freak out and took several minutes to actually leave and the game would then return to normal.\n\nThe menu for golfing is much better, however there are very few options to change in the options menu. This wouldn't be a bad thing if the menu was more clear on what the options did.\n\nAs for gameplay (I used a controller) it isn't bad. However My camera was always very far away from the ball and i had to hold the right trigger to zoom in to the ball. The aerial view would be fine to scout out the course however it was constant. There is no button to skip to where the ball will end up so you can take your next shot, I found the ball rolling very slowly several times and this annoyed me. The things you can do in the game also don't make a lot of sense in a golf game and feel like to much or pointless.\n\nOverall the game isn't great, if you get it for free it might be worth a play, but I would not recommend buying it.","October 27, 2015","false","0.3"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","5"

It's as if Bioshock Infinite's Columbia had a really really terrible minigolf course.  The game starts you outside of 2 buildings, one being the minigolf room and the other a clothing store, the rest of the buildings are off in the distance and look very low rez and there are invisible walls.  Inside the minigolf room there are rows of chairs and a terminal at the end, kinda looks like a barber shop.  Once you select your course from the terminal you sit in a chair and get electrocuted or something.  Then you load into the course.\n\nThe music is very repeative, the mouse controls are flipped for some reason, left mouse is aim right is fire.  The corse design is punishing, even in the first few levels.  I consider myself decent skilled at most minigolf games and while i scored 3 under par on the first course, including a hole in one, the second course had me already at 2 over par for very very thoughlessly designed courses.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a pass.","October 27, 2015","false","0.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Good luch with that.\n\nThe multiplayer function is absolutly atrocious, having no way to be able to connect directly to friends. My friends and I literally spent 20 minutes trying to get all three of us to connect to a single game, without any luck. This game could have been fun, if we were able to play it together.\n\nThe server browser is also very terrible, as it gives you 4 pages of servers list, with a whole 1 page actually shows server. And as it would have it, most, if not all, of the available games are always locked.\n\nBut no such luck, as this excuse for a multiplayer game can't even function as a time waster. It would probably be easier to find the secrets of the universe than to try to connect to friends. I wouldn't wish this experience apon my worst enemy.\n\nMaybe if the multiplayer aspect of this "multiplayer" game actually worked, I would've enjoyed it, but until the multiplayer is fixed, this is a complete waste of time. Please Surprise Attack, make a way to directly connect to a friend or make a functioning server browser.

But...\n\n\nThings that can be done better include enhancing the mechanics and controls. It's a tad bit frustrating to have to drag the aim. Would be nice to incorporate the mouse movement as the aim. Changing the look/aim sensitivity didn't quite make the click and drag system as responsive as I would like. Too slow.\n\nWould like to be able to speed past the moment after you hit the ball. Any point. It's terribly boring and frustrating to be hitting the ball off an edge, and have to wait, unable to press the ESC key to reset the shot even when you know you've failed.\n\nI really want this game to be fun, and I know I still suck, but I just keep finding myself to be annoyed by the awful aspects. I keep feeling unable to pull off the shot I want using the environment. There's no real good way to judge the amount of power necessary to perform a trick shot using ramps and other obstacles, besides constant failure. WHAT IS THIS, DARK SOULS!! I don't want to die a hundred times to master the aim/power mechanics of this crap.\n\nIt's a nice little break from other major genres, but be ready for a world of frustration.\n\nOh, the musical score is pretty soothing, but doesn't go well with the rage this game inflicts upon me.","October 26, 2015","false","0.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

So yeah, I hate myself right now. But this game...it's painful. If I had spent money on it, I'd have hit the refund button already.\n\nPros:\n-It's a golf game on PC\n-It works\n\nCons:\n-Invert Y only works on the right stick. You'll be using the left stick for 99% of game time. Notice how it's listed as having "full controller support"? Yeah, nah.\n-The script is like an AP English student read the wiki of Ayn Rand during a poop session and decided he could whip together a Unity game with some friends based around that.\n-WHEN YOU RESTART A HOLE, IT KEEPS YOUR PREVIOUS STROKE COUNT. Are. You. ♥♥♥♥ing. Jesting. There's a limited-use rewind mechanic, but it doesn't work very well. What is the point of a restart option if it doesn't ♥♥♥♥ing do what it says?\n\nDevs: Thanks for the free game. With improvements, it could be much better.

Dev has responded to pretty much everything, and discusses changing the order of the courses and adding more conventional courses and lots of other things. See it here!\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/272890/discussions/0/46476145268976859/\n\nI really had high hopes. People even poked fun at me for this being #3 on my wishlist but did I care? Nay.\nHowever after only 30 minutes or so I'm pretty sure I will never enjoy this game :(\n\n\nThe whole idea of a mini-golf game in the clouds is cool until you play it. I thought it would be a creative way to simplify and at the same time provide some majesty to the background. But it's actually a mini-golf game where the ball falling OOB into oblivion is the main game mechanic.\nAnd that's sooo not fun.\n\nTo make things worse, the courses are frankly all over othe place*. Most of the time you are not trying to line up shots or timing- you are studying, trying to figure out where in god's name the ball is supposed to be hit so that it may follow a wildly convoluted path towards the 'green'. God forbid you miss an approach to a ramp or escalator, you will lose many shots just tying to get back to a position where you can make the crazy shot.\n\n\n\nCONTROLLER SUPPORT is only for Xbox 360 controller, and axis and other functions on a direct-input controller don't work correctly. The DOF bothers my eyes. You cannot map any controls, and they feel ok but "not quite right." (sorry, thats the best way I can put it with limited played time.)\n\n\nBut even if these things are polished to perfection, I just don't find the game fun! I think they totally missed the boat on what makes minigolf attractive. I really don't want to worry about hitting my ball into the abyss, or rebounding off a moving floor ramp that changes direction randomly, only to push the ball into the abyss, in a mini golf game. What a pain!!\n\nI WILL try to give this some more time to see if I can acquire some affection for it but, I can't recommend this based on what I have experienced so far.\n\n*I only played the first course! But it's obvious this is how the gameplay is designed. And logically the next courses are even harder, which in this case means even worse!\n\n**I basically copy pasted this from a forum post I made so it's kind of awkward as a review, and long as hell-- oh wells xD","July 5, 2014","false","2.3"," 14 of 37 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","14","37","0","2"

For anyone wondering, vertiginous is an adjective to describe something that would cause vertigo, knowing that, this games makes a little more sense. The graphics aren't all that polished, although it is still in alpha. This isn't your straight hit-the-ball-over-the-volcano types of games. This is more of a puzzle game: you need to take time to align shots. God forbid you miss an important entrance or something and wind up tossing your virtual putter around a steampunk themed putting course. This would be great for steampunk fanatics as the visuals are all steampunk. The hummingbird sound effects drove me insane, I actually disabled the audio for what little time I did end up playing. I have no patience for games like these. Excellent concept and idea, poorly executed in my opinion. Although this is in alpha, I really do hope it gets better because you can tell there was a lot of time invested in this game. But for someone like me whose looking for an easy whack-the-ball-over-the-golf course, this isn't for me.

The game would benifit a lot if it had some sort of line showing roughly where your ball will go. Instead the player is forced to gamble on weather or not their power is accurate.\n\nThe game runs at a clean 60+ FPS which you would expect. It lacks a few settings for those who want the most customisation out their gameplay but delivers for lowerend machines. Not so much for any graphics card priced over around £30 as its well done art style is ruined by very low res textures.\n\nThe games world is bizzarely empty for a game with presentation of its type. The art style is packed with personality but would benifit greatly from bouncy characters or some basic lore. You're thrown into this bizzare Steampunk Minigolf world with no explanation as to what is going on.\n\nYou're also given the ability to customize you're poorly modeled character with limited options it means nothing unless you're in the multiplayer lobbies.\n\nThis game offers fun level design and a great art style at the cost of clunky physics. £6.99 seems too much to ask for such an empty experince. I think the game is more of a £2.50 at most.

The game isn't a complete disaster but here are some of the things that make it hard to play.\n\nFirst off, the ball really needs to go into the hole. I get it, when it touches the hole and pops out, it's still in the hole, but that is the most unsatisfying thing about the game. There isn't a satisfying sound effect and the ball isn't in the hole! Do a little work on that.\n\nSecond, and probably most importantly, the physics are a bit... off. I'm not sure exactly what's off about them or how to fix it, but I played 9 holes and got a par, but never really had a good feel on what amount of power was needed for each shot. A shot indicator would perhaps make the game to easy, but then again, if it shows that the physics are accurate then maybe its worth it. Power and shot angles just seems wrong and it messes with then entire feel of the game.\n\nThanks for the read and keep up the good work.

First off, I would like to disclose that I did not actually pay for this, I got it when it was free for 24 hours.\n\nThe major issue I can see is that the courses get way too complex, and sticking to par or under can be incredibly difficult or impossible. The arrows gradually become a suggestion, as you can easily get lost on the course, mainly due to the levels being built vertically, and your scout not being able to travel in 3 dimensions, only 2. Also, many of the harder holes can be weirdly easy, as going off course can make you filter past most of the course, getting you under par by what could be considered cheating.\n\nAnother massive issue is that restarting a hole DOES NOT reset your strokes, pretty much making it pointless. The only reason to ever restart a hole would be so you can get past a part with less strokes, but it not resetting your strokes makes it pointless, you may as well just not care about score and just blast your way to the end, but then why really play in the first place? And why even bother going for a score when the scoring system itself is bugged? Sometimes, even if you shoot under par, you still get an above par score, so there is really no reason to play at all.\n\nThe scenery also gets in the way a lot, often making you unable to see where the ball is or is going,\na full top down view and see through scenery would've helped a lot.\n\nWhilst this issue is subjective, I find its a definite problem for me, and that's that you don't know where the ball is going to go when you hit it, aside from the general direction, or if you have already hit the ball and recalled it. Along with the physics being buggy, it does not help to be blind on where the ball is going to go, or how it's going to react when it collides with a surface, and it's not fair for trial and error to be present when the game centers around taking as few strokes as possible.\n\nThis game's major issue is that it wants to introduce more complex mechanics, but can't even get the basics down first, I could not imagine paying money for this as there are better minigolf games out there for free.","October 27, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You learn that from the moment you start the game. You're looking at a rainy street, and there are no menus. You realise you can walk, and in lieu of menus are two little shops: one where you buy golf gear and hummingbirds of different patterns, and another which sells golf. You walk in, approach an unnecessarily elaborate set of screens, and select your game. The shop bids you to take a seat, and then your character sits there with a bemused smile while electrodes zap golf into his/her head. Never let it be said that this game didn't try to warn you.\n\nSo then we're on the course, which you can examine by going into first-person hummingbird mode, and then see the layout ahead of you. This is a Victorian crazy golf game set in the sky, which should be no surprise to you by this point, and it soon reveals its Mouse Trap-esque arrangements of Heath Robinson-style courses to be distinctly unfair. And when I say "distinctly unfair", I mean it's grotesquely unfair. It's unfair to you, to me, to our ancestors, our children, and even itself. There's one that had me looking with horror from the tee of a torturously convoluted course around its immense circuit, leading to a fenced-off area just a couple of feet from the start. I teed off, sending the ball past a moving wedge onto an unexpectedly powerful conveyer belt which sent the ball almost back to the start. The aforementioned wedge pushed the ball through the fence into the final paddock, very nearly giving me a hole-in-one but letting me finish many shots under par.\n\nBut that's not how it usually goes. Finishing on or under par is cause for celebration, because more often than not you'll be 4 over par, or 24 over par if something especially miserable happens. At this point, you need to know who you are. If you're a shouty controller-breaking type who even gives your own team ♥♥♥♥ on Rocket League as though that will make them play better, this isn't for you (and you're a joyless dickbag). If the weirdness detailed above sounds charmingly eccentric, and getting stuck in a version of golf seemingly designed for Sisyphus by especially cruel supply gods would make you smile at the sheer absurdity of it all, you're alright and we can be friends. In fact, we probably already are friends. There can't be many of us.\n\nTL:DR - I got this ♥♥♥♥ing thing for free, obviously. Still playing it, like.","October 27, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off, I would like to disclose that I did not actually pay for this, I got it when it was free for 24 hours.\n\nThe major issue I can see is that the courses get way too complex, and sticking to par or under can be incredibly difficult or impossible. The arrows gradually become a suggestion, as you can easily get lost on the course, mainly due to the levels being built vertically, and your scout not being able to travel in 3 dimensions, only 2. Also, many of the harder holes can be weirdly easy, as going off course can make you filter past most of the course, getting you under par by what could be considered cheating.\n\nAnother massive issue is that restarting a hole DOES NOT reset your strokes, pretty much making it pointless. The only reason to ever restart a hole would be so you can get past a part with less strokes, but it not resetting your strokes makes it pointless, you may as well just not care about score and just blast your way to the end, but then why really play in the first place? And why even bother going for a score when the scoring system itself is bugged? Sometimes, even if you shoot under par, you still get an above par score, so there is really no reason to play at all.\n\nThe scenery also gets in the way a lot, often making you unable to see where the ball is or is going,\na full top down view and see through scenery would've helped a lot.\n\nWhilst this issue is subjective, I find its a definite problem for me, and that's that you don't know where the ball is going to go when you hit it, aside from the general direction, or if you have already hit the ball and recalled it. Along with the physics being buggy, it does not help to be blind on where the ball is going to go, or how it's going to react when it collides with a surface, and it's not fair for trial and error to be present when the game centers around taking as few strokes as possible.\n\nThis game's major issue is that it wants to introduce more complex mechanics, but can't even get the basics down first, I could not imagine paying money for this as there are better minigolf games out there for free.","October 27, 2015","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You learn that from the moment you start the game. You're looking at a rainy street, and there are no menus. You realise you can walk, and in lieu of menus are two little shops: one where you buy golf gear and hummingbirds of different patterns, and another which sells golf. You walk in, approach an unnecessarily elaborate set of screens, and select your game. The shop bids you to take a seat, and then your character sits there with a bemused smile while electrodes zap golf into his/her head. Never let it be said that this game didn't try to warn you.\n\nSo then we're on the course, which you can examine by going into first-person hummingbird mode, and then see the layout ahead of you. This is a Victorian crazy golf game set in the sky, which should be no surprise to you by this point, and it soon reveals its Mouse Trap-esque arrangements of Heath Robinson-style courses to be distinctly unfair.

The default distance of the camera relative to the player needs to be closer so that all the messages can be seen without the need to zoom in and make it easier to take shots.\n\n2)The controls are poorly optimised for KB+M. More specifically mouse movement, instead of using the mouse on it's own, you need to hold the LMB and move the mouse to position the shot and use the space bar to take it. It seems a little too finiky.\n\n3) The textures seem to be quite buggy in places. I know in the options there is a notice that graphical bugs occur at higher settings, but with my computer[uk.pcpartpicker.com], that should not be the case, those bugs should have been sorted during the early access period.\n\nIn conclusion, the game should of stayed in early access to allow for player feedback to shape the game a little better. It's also a shame I cannot reccommend this, the story, aesthetic and overall feel of the game is interesting.\n\n**Reviewed using the free promo copy provided on 26th October 2015**","October 27, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Annoying when playing the more difficult courses and you have to play all the holes for a final score. If you quit anytime in between holes you will lose your progress.

However, it's really marred by a couple of issues:\n\n1) Most of the courses are more frustrating than fun. Most shots are trick shots where missing by a few inches will quickly send you off the course, or onto the wrong level of the course. Ultimately, I found myself getting angry at the game rather than feeling like I could improve with a bit more practice.\n\n2) The story mode is a mixed bag. It's really nice that they've tried to put some story into a mini golf game, and I think the story itself is OK, but it's quite muddled and the way it's integrated into the course just makes playing the game more difficult.\n\nThe multiplayer experience might be a lot better, but the single player experience is hard for me to recommend.","March 3","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Some people are going to like this and even find it relaxing, like I do. But the kind of people who play things compulsively for 100% completion and try to shave seven-tenths of a second off their best run through a particular level of a game or any of that sort of thing are not going to enjoy this a bit. This is more like a game to lark around with when you have a few minutes to kill.\n\nFirst off, this isn't golf. It isn't even mini-golf. It's more like wacko alternate universe mini-golf. Don't expect physics. Don't expect fine-grained club control. Don't expect rationality, in fact. Just go with it.\n\nSecond, don't worry about par. You're probably not going to make par a lot, no matter how often you play a hole, and it doesn't matter because you're going to get ten pounds even if you take one hundred strokes, and all you have to spend the money on is ugly golf clothes anyway.\n\nJust play it as a puzzle: How the heck do I even FINISH this hole, never mind par? Once I realized that was the outlook to take, it got pretty entertaining. I don't know if I'd play more than one round at a time - today I stopped after about fifteen holes - but I'll likely come back to it.\n\nI have no idea whether multiplayer is any good; haven't tried it. I will say that I tried to play this with both a controller and mouse+keyboard and I think controller is not the way to go here, so if you're a controller person, you might want to pass on this one.\n\nIt's worth ten bucks, but I don't think I'd pay more than that.","January 27","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One day it was free so I decided to try it out, and I have to say, I was very shocked. It was actually playable! I played this game for a few hours and enjoyed every second of it. There is a few problems though, the game is dead and the courses get boring quickly, I wish the game lasted a bit longer which is why I am giving it a 7/10","March 23","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a cool concept with a nice theme and some really interesting (and potentially thoroughly punishing) holes.  Unfortunately, the technical side lets down the cool concept.  The graphics are quite dated but they are functional, however the camera is awful.  The game desperately needs to have parts of the course turn invisible when they're right in front of your face, but they don't and you often wind up taking shots with significantly impaired vision.  Despite the vision issues, it is a fun mini-golf game if you can get past its many technical shortcomings.","April 26","true","7.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Anyways, I really like how this game looks like it's a bad game at first, then it becomes a great game, I know the buildings in the backround look ♥♥♥♥ when you spawn, but hey, at least this game is good.\n\nEDIT: Misspelled Singleplayer","April 23","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"
