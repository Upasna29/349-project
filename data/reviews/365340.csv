"http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/recommended/365340/","epilexia","Epilexia","http://steamcommunity.com/id/epilexia/","691 products in account","A David Lynch’s fragmented nightmare full of Kung-Fu poetry, constructed via the sampling of past retro-masterworks. Mixing Prince of Persia with Mirror’s Edge, a Sega’s Master System color palette with NES tight controls, Another World’s influences with Yie Ar Kung-Fu, a Radiohead inspired soundtrack with Bruce Lee’s awesomeness. A raised in the 80s kid’s warm dream that confirms Larry Stover as one of the most distinctive creators in the indie scene since Nicklas Nygren alias “Nifflas”\nIf The Way of the Pixelated Fist would have been published in the early 90s, it would have become one of my favorite games as a child. With its wise combination of frames extracted from 80’s hallucinatory martial arts movies, mixed with all the elements that made me love videogames.\n\nIts creator Larry Stover works with the same philosophy as a DJ, using a sampler structure to create remixes of old beloved classics with a contemporary approach.\n\nThe game takes a clear inspiration from influential cinematic plattformers like Prince of Persia or Another World, but while you are doing almost impossible jumps through the city skyline, you can feel this same sense of awesomeness of being playing Mirror’s Edge. Its color palette resembles past Sega’s Master System games, but the minimalist approach taken in its graphic design is used to create a relaxed mood that evokes Nifflas classics such as Knytt. Its combat parts are a homage to Jordan Mechner’s first creation, Karateka, that was the precursor to Prince of Persia, but its tight and accurate controls are more close to Konami’s Yie Ar Kung-Fu. There is jumping parts that requires the same millimetric precision as the original Prince of Persia, but its controls are so responsive as modern indie plattformers. There is automatic checkpoints in every new screen visited, but to save the game you need to access the menu, like in the old PC titles. Its graphic style suggest old 8 bits titles, but its soundtrack has a modern drum’n’bass tempo with a floating line of melancholic keyboards that looks at Thom Yorke’s solo works\n\nYou can feel this contrast and amalgam of influences also in its animations. The combats are inspired in classic Kung-Fu movies, so you can expect a lot of frames of animation, with every enemy infused with life and transmitting a constant sense of movement. But its jumping parts looks directly to contemporary deviations of the martial arts film genre, such as Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Zhang Yimou’s House of Flying Daggers. So these animations are intentionally static, with the main character floating suspended in the air.\n\nBut the most distinctive part of The Way of the Pixelated Fist is its original reinterpretation of the cinematic term applied to videogames. Instead of drawing all the screen, The Way of the Pixelated Fist opts for showing its world from a camera angle perspective. Like if every shot was filmed by an invisible fixed camera, an then mutilated in the editing room by a schizophrenic and highly experimental filmmaker. This aesthetic approach submerges the game in a distant halo of unreality. And seeing other past games from Larry Stover like Samurai Jazz, seems as a characteristic trait that surrounds an immense part of his works.\n\nThis fragmented visual approach creates one of the most controversial gameplay features in The Way of the Pixelated Fist. Because all the city’s main map is connected in an illusory loop. And the mutilated film frames only serve to increase the confusion and disorientation in the player. Resulting in an experience similar to watch some of the most experimental movies by David Lynch, in the vein of Mulholland Drive or Inland Empire. With the concepts of time and space being heavily distorted.\n\nPersonally, in a game that lasts for 4 hours, I don’t dislike the idea of being an entire hour completely lost. There is something hypnotic in describing constant circles through the city while you are doing gravity defying jumps in this Larry Stover’s hallucination. And I really appreciate that he has dared to make a game with this level of personality, which is so far from all of its contemporaries.\n\nLuckily, the 6 levels that we can access through the main map are single screen based and they use a lineal construction. Every set of chambers completely changes the focus of the gameplay. One set is based in the original Prince of Persia, using the same color palette and the same ground spike traps. Another set has a modern stealth approach, with robotic eyes that will shoot laser rays if they are able to detect us. And in its level structure, Larry Stover shows a lot of talent as a game designer. With a perfect difficulty curve not based in the frustration.\n\nI feel so fascinated with The Way of the Pixelated Fist, that I can’t wait to discover the rest of the games created by Larry Stover. One of these rare artists that is able to sculpt unique and distinctive universes surrounding his games. And with a certain sense of coherence between his different works. Thanks to his postmodernist approach to the martial arts genre, taking influences from the Nouvelle Vague, from Tarantino’s reconstruction of classic genres or from the characteristic contemplative gaze found in Jim Jarmusch’s films.\n\n\n( The writer of this review is not an English native.

Unfortunately, "cinematics" and "platformer" don't seem to be a good couple. Half the time you can't see where you're going or what you're jumping to next. There is incredibly limited UI and half the time you're wondering what button does what or if a ledge is even grab-able. Trust me, it sucks when you think you've jumped in the right place, only to fall to the city streets below. Plus, your character seems to get stuck... all... the... time. In just a 10 minute play through, I probably got stuck 4 times. Generally, to escape this invisible prison, you have to fall to your death. Thankfully, the game is relatively fast paced and checkpoints are frequent so you don't have to restart all the way at the beginning.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQZcHGYVBTM\nIn closing, I want to recommend this game because I feel like the lone wolf who built this game actually put time and effort thinking it would pay off in the end. Even then, the incredibly modest 1.49 supports that point. Unfortunately, this isn't very fun and I can't objectively recommend it. However, it wouldn't be a bad idea to support the dev anyway... who knows, he may decide to make a platformer without blackboxing that covers 80% of the screen.","April 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","19","28","9","0"

I was instantly drawn in by the title of the game and I decided to check it out.  It looked cool and for such a low price I thought it would be pretty dumb not to buy the game.  So I bought it and played it.  I gotta say, so far, I think the game was worth every penny.  The game takes place in a village hidden in a city's rooftops.  You play as Dag, a guy with one simple goal, to complete the trials in the 36 chambers hidden in his village.  The game is very well designed with a good balance between the martial arts sequences and the parkour/freerunning sequences.  As you go through the game the screen constantly changes it's position, length, width, and size depending on the area you are in.  At first I didn't really know what I thought about the way the screen narrows or lengthens it's view, but I have grown very fond of it.  I think the limited view provides a greater challenge when trying to figure out how to get from one side of the screen to the other.  The chambers in the game are also planned out very nicely.  Every set of chambers has a different theme or feel that makes it unique and separates it from the other sets of chambers.  Over all I think the game is very good.  It could be better but so far I am pleased with the way it is.  In terms of glitches, the only one I've encountered is one in which I jumped onto a wall and got stuck in it.  However, pressing select on my Xbox controller reset the area and fixed this for me.  Also, at the time of posting this review, there was an update that fixed the bug mentioned above.\n\nIn short: I think the game is very good.

This game, is way more foccused on precision: you characther require's room to jump, change direction, he has some weight to him. I appreciate that, a lot. At the beggining it feels kinda jenky, but is pretty tight, which is my jam.\nWhat's also my jam is that while the controls are really simple, the combination of what you do and the way you do it gets really complex. You gotta calculate well when to jump, memorize and apply the timming of your punchs and kicks, and again, after a while, it's second nature.\nAnd the combat is really cool. Imagine if the first double dragon was more slow and thoughtfull. It's really fun testing stun timmings, moves' range and dash speed to make killer combos.\n\nBut it's no all a love affair: the open world of this game is confusing, with lots of buildings that look the same you get easily lost; which is odd, the shapes of the buildings are what tells you what parkour habilities you can use, colours don't affect it:buildings could have different windows, colours and posters to differenciate then. Also, considering that there's a some impossible space going on(or so does it feel), it's weird that the world can't be a straigth line with one or two valleys.\n\nAnd the killing flaw is really problematic: the doors that leads to the chambers (challenge levels required to beat the game) some times simply don't open. Is it a bug? I thought it was either a previous chamber that I didn't complete or a npc I've missed, but one the doors, just one, told me I haven't complete the previous chamber; why didn't that message popped in the other doors?\n\nI really liked what I've played so far, but to continue is a risk: either I find out what was wrong with the doors and keep having fun, or I don't, and get increasilying frustated, and start to hate this "to be game" that I've loved. So, if you like the concept and have the money, try out a small simple idea for two hours and then leave it, thinking "that was a good while it lasted, gonna keep an eye out for this developer's next game".\nWhich is what I'm doing.","December 1, 2015","true","2.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

None of these are really bad, however the game could have been received better if those had been fixed before release.\n\nWhat I would recommend to the dev is to mark it as "early access" until those issues are fixed.

Clunky and basic, broken and really easy. I died maybe twice in combat rooms throughout the entire game.\nBut.. the dev does not seem to be aware of how bad the combat system is. There are so many rooms with just 2 or 3 basic enemies, 4 or 5 boss fights that are basically exactly the same, an entire dungeon dedicated to the combat system, and a few rooms in the last dungeon as well. It's... bad. It's mind-numbingly boring.\n\nThe platforming itself is interesting, though a bit broken. And a bit clunky in general. Yeah, still feels really retro in the worst ways. There's a wall-jump you can do off background objects that I could never get to work consistently, but it makes for decently interesting platforming when it does work. Three of the main dungeons and part of a fourth have some gimmicks to them, spikes and buttons, a bit of stealthy stuff. It's decent fun, not amazing.\n\nThe overworld map is a giant loop with one major split path, and yes, there's a lot of backtracking throughout. You have to find one of the overworld bosses to enter one of the first four dungeons, some of which are a ways away from their boss, and then you have to find a fifth and short sixth dungeon after. I ended up going around basically the entire map three times trying to find all the bosses and with all the mandatory backtracking. It... should've just been linear, honestly.\n\nThis isn't as frustrating a game as most of the blazeepic games I've played, I'll at least say that, but it isn't really worth your time nor money. The developer seems content to remaking the same mediocre game over and over without much variation between each iteration, which I think is a bit pointless to do. Yeah, the sprites and animations here are a bit better and it never really feels unfairly difficult, at least, but it's still not too fun to play overall.","November 25, 2015","false","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Thanks to the tad bad controls you'll find yourself falling to death rather often. Most of the time it is with jumping and falling. You want to fall straight down without hitting anything, but often you'll “grab” the wall, resulting in falling into spikes or down below or whatever. It kind of gets frustrating. Also, sometimes you can die when you're running against the spikes when they're up already. And I'll also say that the cinematic thing really doesn't fit well with this game.
