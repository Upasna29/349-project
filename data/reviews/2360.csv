Probably not. Hexen: Beyond Heretic is easily up there with the greatest of all time. Easily. Everytime I play this I cannot fathom how once such a great industry, overflowing with talent turned into the bland, dumbed-down, soulless mess it is today. We've come down from seeing hundreds of great games and a handful of masterpieces yearly to seeing maybe 1 or 2 semi decent games every 4 years if we're lucky!\n\nHexen, while essentially a first person action fantasy game, takes a lot of influence from RPG games of that era, offering expansive exploration that see's you backtrack through earlier stages of the game to access areas previously unavailable until aquiring a key from a later part in the game. The level design is jaw droppingly amazing, some of the best ever, consisting of sprawling non-linear layouts which are almost psychotically well thought out. There are traps, puzzles scattered through-out the levels as well as hordes of blood thirsty minions to hack into pieces.\n\nThe setting is very similar to that of Heretic and the gameplay to an extent. There are different classes to choose from,  each with their own strengths and weaknesses and each with their own diverse weapons and spells, the classes consist of;\n\nThe Fighter - Melee focused character with weapons more suited for striking range.\nThe Cleric - Which is an all rounder class, mixing the ability to fight with the ability to cast spells.\nThe Mage - Which is self explanatory, the mage starts off weak, with weak spells that are suited for ranged attacks until he becomes a badass later in the game with spells that allow him to fly.\n\nHexen is truly a masterpiece, a work of art, a crowning achievement in gaming, if you haven't played it already I suggest you do so immediately and if you have played it I suggest you play it again. Put down your bland whack-a-mole/military shooters and play a real game!\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=333173358","October 28, 2014","true","13.2"," 116 of 131 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","116","131","0","5"

Take Doom and add some pseudo-RPG elements with a larger focus on puzzles. Set it all in a medieval world with a fantasy direction, as opposed to Doom's sci-fi/hell approach, and you've got Hexen. The music is top-notch as well. I recommend playing this in a Doom source port such as GZDoom, Doomsday, or any of the other available source ports. This will allow for a more modern control scheme and higher resolutions. (Note: this will of course mean that you won't log hours on your Steam record for the game, if that kind of thing matters to you.)","December 23, 2013","true","0.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2360/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","HeXen: Beyond Hereic is a FPS made by Raven Software in 1995. It can be viewed as sequel to Heretic, but only in dark fantasy idea. It's not Doom-clone anymore, instead trying to mix First Person Shooter with RPG elements that are exploration and puzzles. No leveling though.\nCompared to ports the only things you are missing is FMV intermissions of PS1 and Saturn, they are text-only on PC, and maybe split-screen multiplayer of N64. Otherwise count PC version as superior.\nThere also was Hexen on CD. It used redbook music. Steam doesn't have it. But don't worry, they sounded an awful lot like MIDI, but somehow slightly less weak. There were less of tracks too. So you don't miss anything.\n\nSo, DosBox was once again configured badly and will lag badly unless configured. To do that, go to "hexen.conf" file. There you should change output from Ddraw to OpenGL, this should fix this.\nYou can't easily access options to change control and music device from Steam, but at least developers left setup.exe in game's directory. You can open it easily by dragging setup file onto dosbox.exe.\n\nMutliplayer is supposed to be either coop or deathmatch. Probably isn't balanced for Deathmatch. And in coop players can be only in one level at same time. But since original multiplayer isn't something you can set up easily, or maybe not supported at all in Steam or today, I will rather recommend just using Zandronum source port for multiplayer. But this game is more designed toward single-player, multiplayer is bonus.\n\nStoryline goes is that world of Hexen/Cronos is being dictated by three leaders of three factions: Legion, Arcanum and Church. They traded their alliegance for power of unlife to Korax, the second Dragon Rider, an ugly looking skeleton creature who uses Chaos Sphere to get his power. Our three heroes, who belong to those factions, escaped the infulence of Korax and their leaders and sworn to destroy them. Trying to find Korax stronghold to defeat him, they get separated after entering the portal.\nNo, there will be almost no storyline going during game itself. Unless you count "after trying to forget horrors that you encounteredOHGOD what is this horrible place that you got yourself into? HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET OUT ALIVE?!" intermissions. It's mostly just an excuse of why developers decided to put use of player classes sprites as bosses in the final world.\n\nSo, the game tries to be less like Doom. It's not about speeding and rushing through series of linear levels. It's about getting hopelessly lost on hub consisting of few levels and then using Google. And pushing switches. Many switches. Switches are puzzles. Switches are everything.\nBut yes, it tries to vary up things with more exploration. You will have to search corners and walls of levels, trying to find hidden passages and switches. You will also have puzzles, which is either bring "key" item to the needed place or pressing switches. Sometimes it's not about switches, but it's a rare occurance. I also should note one single flaw: for majority of the game you can place the needed item automatically into place where you have to place them by pressing "open/use". But for Yorick's Skull you will have to actually use it from inventory by "use inventory item". That confused me for a while.\n\nLevels are connected to each other into hub worlds. There are five hubs in the game, each with around five or more levels. If a switch will do something important on another level, you will be notified. And thanks to more complex scripting, there are some traps or interesting things will happen occasionally. Second hub world is one of the most confusing ones and yet it's the best one when it comes to atmosphere.\nBut, as said, no RPG elements like leveling or NPC.\n\nGlitches also happen sometimes. Like, on the 4th hub the boss may sometiems not spawn. Or magic bridge in 2nd hub may not spawn if enemey blocked it. They sure ruin the fun. Especially when you have to check walkthrough to realize that something went wrong.\n\nThe game lets you choose one of the three classes: Fighter, Cleric and Mage.\n- Fighter is best in anything aside from magic. At least this is what stat image says. If forget that "magic" isn't really a thing there. Anyway, he is melee class, will not get ranged weapon in a while. His blows are strong, he is fast and he can tank damage up. He is the fun with who you will have fun playing as. His flechette, very common item for the game that does different things for each class, is just throwing it forward like explosive.\n- Cleric is average class. His stats are average. At least he is not a bad ranged class. His second weapon even has special property of healing you up while used in melee range. His flechettes are most powerful, blowing into poison cloud. This poison will painlock any enemy and will keep doing a damage on them, while you get to just watch them slowly get hurt. But the bad thing here is that his playstyle is tedious. Game's biggest problem are centaurs that always shield up after getting single hit. They are annoying. Fighter don't have to hit them much. But Cleric will either have to fight them for some long time or he will have to use flechette and then wait some time for them to die. Thus, it's not so fun beating game as him. Pick Warrior instead.\n- Mage is has low class on everything, but has highest "magic". That means that even his basic weapon is magical peashooter. And his second weapon feels the weakest. While the third weapon is quite powerful. But all of them waste a lot of mana. And he is quite slow class too. His flechette are weak, just working as timed bomb. What I am saying is that he isn't much of fun to play either. But at least he doesn't have as much of problem with shielding centaurs as Cleric does. Unless you don't have ammo for the third weapon, then gameplay becomes tedious once again. Pick Warrior instead.\n\nSo yea, Hexen is fun, but only with Warrior. Every other class will have tedious parts.\nGame also doesn't bring any good variety during walkthrough. You got three classes, each with their own unique four weapons. But the catch is that you can only play as one class for over 30 levels. As a result, you have only four weapons for whole game. First one is basic and is never used. And 4th one is super-weapon. And third weapon is usually better than the second, even though second and third weapon use their own manas types. So, there is not much thinking involved in picking needed weapon. I can say that it's not as much of thinking or fun in single walkthrough as in Heretic.\n\nThere is a good variety in enemies though. Some are melee. Common and weak. Others are tough and shoot. And there is a blocking centaurs. As said, it's a common enemy, that brings game down with his tendency to become invincible after getting hit by bringing shield up for a while. Game would have been good without them.\nBut hey, at least there are some bosses. Like, three of them. Eh, yes, it's not much. And one is reused again.\n\nGraphics is a step-up on technical side and step-down on artstyle. It uses much more high-resolution sprites. Everything looks bigger and taller. But on bad sides they forgot about color. The unique awesome colorful world of Heretic was tossed out and was replaced by something brown and green. Which looks good sometimes, but most often not. It can be agrued that it fits to dark atmosphere. Well, second hub atmosphere was nice, but after that I surely was missing Heretic.\nMusic also took a step back. Probably more fit to exploration, but it's not catchy. I hardly can remember any good track outside of the first level.\n\nHexen is a mixed bag. It's puzzles and combat get tedious at times. I only recommend beating it only as Warrior and pay attention to what switches do. I found enjoyment in that way. Otherwise, it's a bad game.","June 16, 2015","true","8.5"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

I suspect this is the first game to allow you to freely come and go between levels (once you unlock them, of course), much like you can in games like Castlevania: Symphony of the Night (although slightly unlike Castlevania, it has a hub world). The gameplay is, well, imagine doom with more melee weapons, and magic instead of guns. It's kick-♥♥♥♥. It's fast-paced, difficult, murderous fun, however it is not entirely without its flaws.\n\nI very strongly reccomend you download a mod called Zandronum, along with downloading novert, as these give proper mouse-look (well, you can't look up and down, but the game is designed with that in mind, so it's not an issue), along with letting you customise controls and increasing the resolution of the textures, unless you're nostalgic for graphics that, in all honesty, have aged poorly. Also, the level designers seemed to have a raging hard-on for levels with poor lighting.\n\nHowever, in spite of all that, plus it's insanely easy to get lost, I have to reccomend this game. The gameplay is, as you can tell from the screenshots, DOOM in a fantasy setting. You run around at mach 5 hitting ♥♥♥♥ with a lightning axe or shooting fire from your hands. Buy it, or buy the Hexen + Heretic bundle. If you like video games, fun and retro ♥♥♥♥-kicking action, you won't regret it.","May 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","15","15","4","0"

In Hexen you can pick between playing as a Warrior, a Cleric, and a Mage. Each of these classes has different weapons, playstyles and powerups affect them differently. This greatly adds to the game's replayability and the multiplayer.\n\nAlongside that Hexen has hub levels. However part of my gripes with the game revolve around the level design. Hexen requires a great deal of backtracking in it's level design, and you can expect to have to return to prior levels regularly inorder to solve puzzles. This can get very confusing as the game goes on since you can get stuck very easily and have to constantly search old levels for the solution to a puzzle.\n\nHowever the game does redeem itself by how great it's combat is. Once you get beyond the sometimes annoying level design you have a very enjoyable hack and slash, not one of Raven's best games mind you but still worth playing.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=455307166","November 30, 2014","true","10.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","13","15","0","1"

So this essentially is another FPS With a Fantasy atmosphere like its predecessor, Heretic.\nUnlike Heretic this time we won't be impersonating Corvus as the setting is totally different. We are in a different world Dominated by the second Serpent rider, Korax, and his minions. And here comes the first innovation: we get to choose our class before beginning our game. Warrior, Cleric And Mage are the three classes we might choose, and this is something that really affects our gameplay because each class has its own weapons balanced by different characteristics. For example, the warrior is stronger and faster, so he can take more phisycal damage and move faster because most of his weapons are mostly hand weapons. On the other side We have the mage, weaker and slower but his weapons are magic based and they all can do damage from the distance. The cleric, as usual is the middle class, Not as weak as the mage, nor strong as the warrior and almost all his weapons can hurt from the distance.\nJust like its predecessor, Heretic, You have a wide variety of items (powerups or tools) you can store to use at will in other moments.\nHowever, the biggest revolution in this title is its structure. Unlike any other previus FPS where you have a sequence of levels to play, in Hexen you have "Hubs" which can be seen as "stations" where you can unlock passages to other minor closed levels for the purpose to solve elaborated puzzles that will ultimately unlock the passage to the next Hub. This gives the game a bigger depth even though I admit I've never liked it and because of this I lost motivation and never actually finished it (at the time, about 20 years ago).\nAs usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.\n\n+++PROs+++ STRUCTURE. Clearly the all new structure of the levels is an innovation that, paired with puzzles in the minor levels, gives the game a big playability by making the player moving back and forth from more maps. This way, even though you will end up re-visiting the same place many times you have the illusion of a bigger world. Honestly this always had the look of a maze to me, but I've never really tried that much.\nFANTASY. Following the fantasy atmosphere from its predecessor Hexen does a bigger job by renewing the locations and making the game with a bit darker tones. in my opinions it's a bit scarier and ominous than Heretic.\nGAMEPLAY. Besides the ability to look up and down already introduced in Heretic, Now you can jump as well. Nothing too useful but at least that's a step forward XD. And just like Heretic you still have the inventory system with some old items already seen in Heretic and other useful and interesting tools. Note that some of these tools have a different functions according to the class you choose. Another innovations relies in the interaction with ambience, you can find glass mosaics that can be broken revealing hidden rooms or bonus items and besides that there are some jars that can be broken to find more bonus items.\nMODS & COMMUNITY. You can find mods, and other stuff. But most importantly, there are custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with tricks and advices on replacing DosBox with better ports and implementing the Steam Overlay.---CONs--- MUSIC. Unfortunately i didn't enjoy that much almost any of the tracks in the game, unlike its predecessor Heretic.\nSTEAM OVERLAY. As usual, like on every other old steam release running on DosBox, there's no Steam Overlay.\nSTRUCTURE. Even though this is a new kind of structure I personally didn't enjoy it too much because it forces me to visit and revisit the same leves again and again before proceeding to the next hub, resulting in a repetitive gameplay.","February 12","true","0.7"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

This game is for people who played ClassicDOOM on DOS. Released during the same era of gaming, Hexen is, as the title suggests, the sequel to Heretic.  I actually never played this in its heyday, so this is actually a new experience for me.  I didn't understand the hub system when I was younger, so never actually touched Hexen until just recently.\n\nIn this game, instead of being just one "DOOMguy" or "Corvus/Hereticguy/FantasyDOOMguy," you can choose one of three classes: a Fighter, a Cleric, or Mage.  Each have their strengths and weaknesses, and will actually use certain items/powerups in the game differently, most notably the Flechette.  The demos that play if you don't create a new game are a bit misleading, as they suggest that each class has a different set of levels to playthrough.  Or, they did for me anyway.  I quickly figured out that is not the case, and was a little disappointed at first, but quickly got over it.  Now that I'm older, I understand the Hub system better and am able to navigate through the levels easier.  One thing I would stress: explore everywhere.  Don't leave any portion of your maps blank if you can help it.  Some important switches are hidden in easily-disregarded places, and you will find yourself stuck if you don't throw/flip them.\n\nPeople looking for "new and exciting ame mechanics" will likely be very disappointed.  As far as I know, this particular iteration of a hub system has not been recreated for any other (popular) FPS-type game outside the Heretic franchise.  But, if you played these games and similar during their heyday, I would highly recommend getting them for a trip down Memory Lane.\n\n(Also, the price of these games in the bundle can't be beat.

All the core things that made this game interesting and fun to play are still there today. Interesting usable items, strange puzzles that can often lead you to an early grave, and vicious enemies waiting to club you to death, or burn your corpse to a crisp.\n\nThere are three classes you can play in this game, and all have weaponry and stats unique to them. All of them offer a slightly different take on playing through the game, and after trying them all out for the first area or so, you'll quickly choose one as a favorite.\n\nInteresting level design, cool weapons and items, surpise enemy attacks, and fast game play keep this game going strong until the end. If you're looking for an alternative to Doom, or maybe even Quake this would be it. Especially since it has the whole fantasy genre twist to go with it, and a bit better level design and interactivity.\n\nIf you can figure out how to get multiplayer going in this game, it is definitly worth it. There's nothing quite as nice as slaughtering tons of demons with a buddy, and having help figuring out puzzles and finding keys strewn through out the well designed levels.\n\nHowever don't expect to have an easy way to do it. All the methods I could find seemed some what difficult to attempt to set up a game, even with third party programs such as Hamachi, it's a bit difficult to figure it out, and get a game running with a friend. There's probably a guide somewhere out there that will assist you in this, if only playing with friends is a deal breaker for you.\n\nPick this game up if you enjoy playing old school FPS shooters. This one might suprise you, and keep you playing to the end. If you've played it before, it's definitly worth having on here just to blast through a few levels every once in awhile. If you've never played the game before, give it a try, it's worth a spin if you never got to experience it before.\n\nAvoid the N64 Port AT ALL COSTS.

Yes, it can get monotonous at times, and yes, those are the only weapons you get for the whole game, but combining Heretic's inventory system with a pseudo-RPG class element and a borderline open world like something from The Witcher makes this a good experience for any fan of rougelikes or adventure games with a dash of simple puzzles thrown in. Like Heretic, I suggest you run this using GZDoom, as the battles can get pretty hectic, and trying to aim in Dosbox will make you pull your hair out.","June 17, 2014","true","29.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Far, far back in time when a door opening horizontally in a Doom game was considered impressive. Seriously, in 1995 that was an excellent demonstration of the improved Doom engine. So was the fact that levels spanned multiple maps, and you could return to previous ones. Hole. Lee. ****.\n\nOk, so, not so impressive these days. However, it is still a fun game. You choose from three different classes - your generic brawler, your clichéd wizard, and an in-between cleric. Each character has four different weapons and two different types of mana to power the weapons. Gameplay is very much like Doom, in that you are searching for the exit to a level, which you get by finding secrets and keys. While the plot (yes there is a plot, just not much of one) doesn't change at all based on your characters, the gameplay does. The brawler uses mostly melee weapons, while the wizard uses projectiles. The game is broken into five episodes, each of which contains several maps. You'll need to get through a bunch of locked gates by finding keys and magical items. There's a wide range of difficulty, both from your character class as well as a difficulty settings.\n\nWhile the game obviously isn't going to be offering anything new, it isn't just for people who played it 20 years ago. It's still a fun game with great atmosphere and some interesting puzzles. After downloading it, just make sure you get the ZDoom engine for it. It wasn't updated at all for the Steam release, so it looks really ugly out of the box. ZDoom increases the resolution to modern standards and adds a bunch of new features as well.\n","September 29, 2014","true","0.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Are you ready to die?!"\n\nWarning: This game is SCAAAARY, So we'll probably see a horrible Pewdiepie let's play of it soon.\nNah, I don't think I can really call this game scary. It does though have a very complete and dense atmosphere, heavily saturated by its sound design and soundtrack. Atleast, that's how I remember it from when it was probably the pinnacle of my childhood. When I improvise a melody, the arrangement will usually be similar to the overall theme of Hexen's OST, infact.\nBut I digress. I will actually warn you about this game, jokes aside.\nThrough Steam, this game may be completely unplayable for you as it was for me. Wanting to dig up old roots, I found myself disappointed, as the controls were all wrong and broken. If the same will happen for you. I can't say.\n\nI've heard some call Hexen as shooter. This I feel is out of place, though granted there's ranged weaponry that could work in favor of that statement.\nThe game plays as sort of an RPG in first person perspective. Where each level is a hub that has smaller levels or dungeons that have secrets, and you wander back and forth to open up new areas here and there. It all unfolds the hub area progressively til you have "solved the puzzle" and can move to next level.\nYou choose between three characters. One strong in magic, one less o' that but resilient and punchy, and then the middleground.\nAt times this can be very difficult, and one late boss fight always had a tendency to bug out, to much frustration.\nStrong aesthetic, and I owe this game thanks for many hours of mystery and great gameplay.\n\nIt's truly been very inspiring to me, and while it's old it still deserves appreciation among newer games.\n\nTil next time.","April 1, 2013","true","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Heretic had DOOM like puzzles (find the key to unlock a door), but HeXen has VERY confusing puzzles. When you do something involved with the puzzle the game will tell you "one third of the puzzle has been solved" (or "one half") and then you have no idea what to do next! Then when you solve the puzzle all the way you don't know what you did, or where you are supposed to go now! Plus, the levels are made of multiple levels. So to solve the puzzles you will need to travel back and forth between levels! But other than puzzles HeXen is actually a pretty good game (for 1995). Unlike Heretic that was just DOOM with new paint, HeXen is a new game with new mechanics. But I found the puzzles WAY to confusing.

Now one of three heroes must go kill Korax and save the land. Once again I have nothing to say except that Korax actually insults you in every hub. I like that.\n\nGameplay\n\nThe game has three characters you can play as: the Cleric, the Mage and the Warrior.\n\nThe Cleric starts out pretty bad with a weak weapon but soon gets some of the best weapons and the flask can really destroy groups if used right.\n\nThe Mage is my favorite as he has good range with weapons and while I didn't like he's ultimate weapon, his other weapons can carry you.\n\nI didn't finish the Warrior as while he does have a good starter weapon, I knew I wasn't gotta have fun with cause I like range in my FPS.\n\nOne of the unique gameplay features is that the game use a hub system. Every hub is divided into several levels and you have to go back and forth to pull switches and find keys. While I don't mind this as it encourages exploration, there's no way of no knowing what the switch did and you might have to be lucky in finding the level that has the next key or switch that you have to get and you might get lost.\n\nYou have twelve weapons in the game, but each class has four. a starter that use no ammo, a blue and green weapon, I called that they use blue and green ammo and the ultimate weapon which can only be used when you find the three parts to it. The enemies, while simple, are varied and can be difficult if you don't know what you doing. Ex. you first fight with two headed goons that just wack you with club, but in the same level, you meet flying imps that rapidly fire fireballs, and these things tend to appear in groups. and these are the foes you start with.\n\nThe inventory is still here with some old toys like the health potion and the one that turns enemies into animals(this time pigs.) and new ones like the flask which is a different bomb for each class and one toy that can summon a MAULOTAUR!!\n\nAlso, there's jumping and some minor jumping parts.\n\nPresentation\n\nDon't care much about the music, it's just there. The art design and presentation however is great despite being dark and brown and grey. Each level has a different theme to it and you can tell where you are by knowing what design it is. In the first hub, each level portal is surrounded by the textures you see in the level, but when you see fire themes and textures in the ice level means there's a portal to the fire level nearby.\n\nThis is both a minor and major point both there's a lot a little details added like destroying glass leaves some shards on the ground or when you overkill a grunt, his club will be laying somewhere away from the corpse. Heck, even the way some doors open is pretty cool for a DOOM engine game.\n\nVerdict\n\nI like this game and while I would personally give it an nine, the lack of direction holds it back so instead it's:\n\n7/10","April 24, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Hexen (a continuation of the Herretic: Legend of the Serpent Riders) is an early first-person Action Fantasy. A good comparison is the Fantasy version of titles like Doom and Quake, with a storyline similar to the idea of Diablo. The multiplayer was also wicked fun on the console, though I'd love to see if the PC version supports a multiplayer just as good. There are 3 classes (Fighting, Magic(more ranged), and a ballance between the two), each with their own unique weapons and play types.

Instead, Hexen adds a surprisingly challenging puzzle element, fittingly frustrating deathtraps (meet Dark Souls in 2D) and a non-linear hub system not that common in the FPS genre. Three classes to choose from, offering choices for whether you're the glass cannon type who nukes from afar (Mage), the melee-oriented powerhouse who charges in and wrecks sh|t (Fighter) or the middle-of-the-road dilettante with self-healing options for the defensive-minded (Cleric).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/N64Lain/recommended/2360/","N64Lain","N64Lain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/N64Lain/","58 products in account","Hexen is a great Co-op shooter. It is definitely a must try for any RPG, fantasy, or shooter fan. I enjoyed this game on the N64 and I am very glad to be able to enjoy it on Steam.\n\nThe story of Hexen takes place after Heretic, the first game in a series of three about the Serpent Riders. The main character from Heretic defeated the first Serpent Rider (SPOILER IF YOU WANTED TO PLAY HERETIC) and now, in a different world, three heroes must fight through their world to defend it from the second Serpent Rider. It may be a cliche fantasy story, but it's cool that it spans three games.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is far from cliche. Hexen is, if I am not mistaken, one of the first FPS games to combine puzzle-solving with the shooting that Doom incorporated. It works really well here! One gripe I do have though is that the level design is a little weird so you might get lost easily. There's also a class system that Hexen has. You can play as either a mage, a fighter, or a cleric. The only real difference between the classes is the weapons they use however. All these classes do have an ultimate weapon. To get the ultimate weapon, you have to get three pieces to the weapon that your class has.\n\nThe mage is more of a long range character who starts with a magic staff, which can be used to shoot the bell in the tower in the first level, and the mage can also grab an ice spell, which can freeze enemies, and a lightning spell which can clear rooms in a matter of seconds. The trade-off is that he moves slower than the other classes. The ultimate weapon for the mage is a more enhanced version of the regular staff. Kind of a let down since the third weapon already does so much already.\n\nOne of the other characters to choose from is the Fighter. He's the class that has a lot of CQC. The fighter starts out with spiked gauntlets. He can upgrade to an axe that shoots and also a hammer that can throw other hammers like it's Gauntlet! The fighter's ultimate weapon is a really sweet ranged sword that can throw fire at enemies.  Now these weapons have some low range, but the biggest strength of the Fighter is that he can run fast, so he can fight his enemies up-close and personal.\n\nThe last class is the cleric, which is my personal favorite. He starts with a lame mace but then upgrades to an insane weapon right afterwards. After that, the cleric gains fire hands that can burn your opponents into piles of ash. Then comes the ultimate weapon. And the cleric really puts the ULTIMATE in ultimate weapon. It's a...thing...which fires ghosts that literally rip apart the enemies. Thought the mage's third weapon devastated enemies? This thing can clear rooms in mere ten seconds! But remember that this is pretty much the mix between the mage and the fighter, so it can move faster than the mage, but slower than the fighter. But that won't be a problem because this game has...\n\nCO-OP!! Yep! You and three friends, you can have more but I recommend three, can take down the enemies and hunt down the second serpent rider! I recommend Zandronum if you're going to play online though. It's the best port for online play. I also recommend the Wrath of Cronos mod. It will add some new RPG elements to the game and will add new reason to attack. If you were a fan of the N64's music, you can find a mod that will replace the music with the songs that were on the N64 version of the game.\n\nAll in all, this game is great.

After finding out that, much like its predecessor, Heretic, Hexen ran on the old Doom engine, I expected a typical Doom-esque episodic campaign system. I was wrong and pleasantly surprised when I found out that the game differed noticeably from the other Doom engine games.\n\nYou can choose from three different classes to play as, each with their own weapons and stats. The Fighter is obviously the most melee-based class, while the Mage's attacks are all ranged, and the Cleric is sort of the in-between guy.\n\nUnlike what I expected, the game's levels are open-ended (to an extent) hub world with several portals to different areas, giving a unique spin on the gameplay. The game has some parts where you have to solve some puzzles or find semi-hidden switches or interactable walls to advance or perhaps unlock something in another area of the current hub world. The game contains 5 large hubs with about 4-6 sub-areas per hub. I found myself getting stuck often because I would miss a switch somewhere and not be able to find it for a good while, forcing me to revisit every area to double-check every wall and corner for it.\n\nIn Hexen, you only get 4 weapons throughout the adventure, your starting weapon, a weapon that uses blue mana, a weapon that uses green mana, and the ultimate weapon for that class that uses both blue and green mana upon use. Similar to Heretic, I found myself often having more mana and inventory items than I would have ever needed, but the game was still quite challenging on Skill 4.\n\nI definitely recommend this game. It has a bit of an RPG spin on the old Doom system, which is refreshing.","November 28, 2015","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is barely existant but you don't feel you need it anyways. Everything is, well, sprite images. But its not bad really because they are higher quality sprites. Good sprites in my opinion hold up better than primitive polygonal 3D objects. Also the puzzles are very obtuse and confusing, you will be visiting Doom wiki alot. The real caveat is to not play it in the Steam executable, just download the source port GZDoom or the like and start playing!\n\nIts a great game but its not for everyone. If you liked Heretic, you will proably like Hexen. If you like Doom 64, you will probably love Hexen.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/N64Lain/recommended/2360/","N64Lain","N64Lain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/N64Lain/","58 products in account","Hexen is a great Co-op shooter. It is definitely a must try for any RPG, fantasy, or shooter fan. I enjoyed this game on the N64 and I am very glad to be able to enjoy it on Steam.\n\nThe story of Hexen takes place after Heretic, the first game in a series of three about the Serpent Riders. The main character from Heretic defeated the first Serpent Rider (SPOILER IF YOU WANTED TO PLAY HERETIC) and now, in a different world, three heroes must fight through their world to defend it from the second Serpent Rider. It may be a cliche fantasy story, but it's cool that it spans three games.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is far from cliche. Hexen is, if I am not mistaken, one of the first FPS games to combine puzzle-solving with the shooting that Doom incorporated. It works really well here! One gripe I do have though is that the level design is a little weird so you might get lost easily. There's also a class system that Hexen has. You can play as either a mage, a fighter, or a cleric. The only real difference between the classes is the weapons they use however. All these classes do have an ultimate weapon. To get the ultimate weapon, you have to get three pieces to the weapon that your class has.\n\nThe mage is more of a long range character who starts with a magic staff, which can be used to shoot the bell in the tower in the first level, and the mage can also grab an ice spell, which can freeze enemies, and a lightning spell which can clear rooms in a matter of seconds. The trade-off is that he moves slower than the other classes. The ultimate weapon for the mage is a more enhanced version of the regular staff. Kind of a let down since the third weapon already does so much already.\n\nOne of the other characters to choose from is the Fighter. He's the class that has a lot of CQC. The fighter starts out with spiked gauntlets. He can upgrade to an axe that shoots and also a hammer that can throw other hammers like it's Gauntlet! The fighter's ultimate weapon is a really sweet ranged sword that can throw fire at enemies.  Now these weapons have some low range, but the biggest strength of the Fighter is that he can run fast, so he can fight his enemies up-close and personal.\n\nThe last class is the cleric, which is my personal favorite. He starts with a lame mace but then upgrades to an insane weapon right afterwards. After that, the cleric gains fire hands that can burn your opponents into piles of ash. Then comes the ultimate weapon. And the cleric really puts the ULTIMATE in ultimate weapon. It's a...thing...which fires ghosts that literally rip apart the enemies. Thought the mage's third weapon devastated enemies? This thing can clear rooms in mere ten seconds! But remember that this is pretty much the mix between the mage and the fighter, so it can move faster than the mage, but slower than the fighter. But that won't be a problem because this game has...\n\nCO-OP!! Yep! You and three friends, you can have more but I recommend three, can take down the enemies and hunt down the second serpent rider! I recommend Zandronum if you're going to play online though. It's the best port for online play. I also recommend the Wrath of Cronos mod. It will add some new RPG elements to the game and will add new reason to attack. If you were a fan of the N64's music, you can find a mod that will replace the music with the songs that were on the N64 version of the game.\n\nAll in all, this game is great. It's a really good FPS with some puzzle elements that will have you going through the hub worlds on your quest to defeat the second Serpent Rider. Hexen is a great game and I totally recommend it, especially with a few friends on Co-Op play.","December 6, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
