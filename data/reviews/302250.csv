"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CooterPatooter/recommended/302250/","CooterPatooter","Halcyon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CooterPatooter/","630 products in account","Manhunter reminded me of those bundles you would find in software stores during the early-to-mid 2000's featuring one decent title and several awful ones.  They'd usually be called "Action Pack" or something like that.  These would almost invariably contain at least one buggy shooter from a tiny Russian or eastern European developer.  I felt a twinge of nostalgia as I slogged through Manhunter's ultra-repetetive gameplay, its head-scratching narrative, its weak level design, its 2004-era graphics, its sometimes-brutal checkpointing, its laughable sound effects, its broken stealth scenes, its intolerably long load times, its slew of bugs of all possible kinds and its overall unfinished feel.  Manfunter is just plain bad, bad, BAD.","July 6, 2015","false","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

He really shows the cold blood of human nature he is in it for the cash but don't take him for no newby. As you play this game make sure you are sitting in a mlg gaming chair,drinking mtn dew, eating cheetos, and leave lotion close by. As soon as this game starts up you will do the following\n\n1. Cry from the opening showing you the real balls that is manhunter.\n\n2. Get a throbing hard on for the pure grity action.\n\n3. Download the offical soundtrack.\n\n4. Tremble with fear from the A.I. that will adapt to your play style.\n\nThis is the game of the year no more Undertale, Fallout 4, Metal gear, Assassin's creed, Or any other BS triple a titles. This game has changed gaming as we know it setting up new expectations for the FPS genere. If you buy this game just one warning prepare yourself for the deep hurt that will occur from no announcments for manhunter 2.

Anyway I gave the game a try cause I am such an idiot.\n\n\nNegative Points:\nStory\n- I think the story was made with some kind of "story generator" software. It is just so 0815 and boring, even a dead coyote can create a better storyline. The short story is a gift in this case!\n\nGraphics\n- Pretty bad. Something between vomit guarantee and eye cancer.\n\nSound\n- Weapon sounds are awful.\n\nBugs\n- The average bugs which appears in every game of this type like floating cars, glitching through object or getting stucked.\n- Also some game breaking bugs like random "Mission failed" bugs or the problem that the objectives dont get triggered.\n\nAnimations\n- Clunky, stupid, ugly!\n\nAI\n- The AI act completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- The spawn system works horrible and it happens very often that many enemies spawn at the exact same spot which can causes bugs. Also it looks ridiculous when suddenly a group of enemies just spawn in front of you - out of nowhere..\n- If you got your "AI friend" he will give a ♥♥♥♥ about you and he will shoot you into your back whenever you cross his fireline.. and of course this will damage you -_-\n- AI will detect/see you no matter what you are doing or where you are hiding.\n\nGame design\n- Boring linear levels. When you want to explore the level you will get the famous "get back or get killed" message..\n- Head bobbing cant be turned off - annoying!\n- The game want to focus on sniper combat huh? So have fun to rush into a skyscraper with your 2 snipers. As we all know, sniper rifles are the best weapons for close combat fights..\n- Only a few weapons. Assault rifles and SMGs are too weak anyway.\n- The cave levels are so ♥♥♥♥ing dark that you see nothing. Bad design choice.\n\n\n\nNeutral Points:\nNo Multiplayer\n- It's ok because it would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dead by now.\n\n\nPositive Points:\nNothing\n\n\n\nConclusionAnother boring shooter which got the same "quality level" as the old games from City Interactive (Terrorist Takedown series for example). This game got nothing special, nothing which let the game stand out from the crowd - just another cheap and brain-dead shooter.\nDo not buy it (even when it is on sale..)!","January 4","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/302250/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","When I first took a look at "Manhunter" (around the time I purchased "Manhunt", oddly enough), I saw all the negative reviews that said all the same thing. "I stopped playing after the first ten minutes". Well, I'm glad to know YOUR habits, but what exactly about this game sucks? Well, everything, but that's beside the point. Wait, actually...\n\nThe first thing that sucks about this game would probably be everything. The sound is just standard gun sounds. Nothing special. The voice-acting is sub-par (Especially John's voice actor- and you hear him 90% of the game!). And the graphics literally want to look bad in this game. I kid you not! The game lags more than a Windows 95 trying to run a full Mincraft server with 64 people on it. And, to put things in perspective, I can play BioShock, Mass Effect 2, and The Old Republic on my computer just fine. No lag. No framerate issues. But this game is just... It's basically like a neurotic mother-in-law that can't make up her mind about anything? Will this level have a good framerate? ... No. Will this level have good sound? Sure! Will this level have clunky animation? Yes, to all of them!\n\nProbably the most noticeable flaw (the one, I assume, that turned off gamers after ten minutes into this game) is the walking. And jumping. And sprinting. And interacting with the world, really. It just all sucks. When John walks, it feels like he's walking on rubber legs and has to fling them out one at a time in order to properly move. When he jumps, it looks like he does a normal jump then out of nowhere, just farts and gets an extra boost on his jump. And John basically sprints like a fat kid during his first day at gym school. You can sprint for a total of... 5 meters. Or less. And then John will pant like a dog into your headphones for the next 30 seconds. Lovely. And the actual animations of the NPCs are just... unnerving. They move like programmed robots. Like Davies at the beginning of the game (and the *koff* "citizen" at the end of the game (even though it's just Davies again)) walks in cutscenes with his arms oddly spread out and pointing down. And enemies will die in unnatural manners, flinging in very specific directions after you snipe them.\n\nAnd you will snipe. A lot. I mean, if you're the only intelligent being in this game, you will snipe enough- since the only way to kill the waves of enemies fast enough it to hit them in the head, and the only gun that can do that properly is your sniper rifle. And the game seems to focus heavily on it's sniper rifles, since it'll give you TWO at the beginning of every stage and each one will be filled with TWO HUNDRED bullets. But the sniping (really just the shooting as a whole) is monotonous and uninspired. The game will show you the wind when you zoom in on your scope, but that only mattered once in the entire game when I had to snipe trucks... that would explode in one hit. But whenever you point your scope at an enemy the reticule that shows you where your bullet will hit and would be off to whatever direction the wind blows it, just happens to lock right on your enemy.\n\nThis game is all about walking, running, and sprinting. There is no variety or creative level design to pace out the experience more. And the story compliments it's perfectly by being the exact same thing. You'd think the game would end after you finally kill the RIGHT hit you were originally supposed to kill, or perhaps when you disable a ruddy bloody rocket! But the game just ambles on, and only ends when it feels it's padded itself to a long enough point. And I had no reason to care about the story of the characters. Max and John are the only main characters in the whole story and all their dialogue amounts to is-\nMAX: John, do this!\nJOHN: Roger that. (x500)\n\nWhat else sucks? Well, I did say everything, so what about the AI? Yeah, that sucks. Just like the game itself, the AI is programmed to be either "Stand here and keep shooting, and never take cover." Or "Flank John at the worst possible moment," because when I'd hang behind my cover for just about 7 seconds to heal (which takes forever to do in this game)- a random baddy would either spawn behind me or run around on my side and start shooting me. And I've even seen some enemies hide behind foliage, which I found oddly smart for the otherwise ignorate AI. And all your enemies are either Russians or Middle Easteners, so you already know the game's view on relationships with people outside their own country.\n\nThe music is also very limited. There are only two different tracks that play during shoot-outs and that's it. There is no music beyond that. And whenever you finish a shoot-out, the music will cut off awkwardly. And this isn't a glitch (even though this game is filled with those), because during the 5 hours I played this game- this would happen every time I killed the enemies in a room (which would be hilarious if I killed a guy in room, and the music would only pause for two seconds, as I'd open the door and new enemies would come out.)\n\nThe levels are very straightforward and pretty easy to grind through to get to where you want to get to. But the game is a bit too linear. If you deviate even a little from the course (or want to try swimming) you have 4 seconds to retrace your steps or you are screwed. And the save points in this game suck, because of how poorly dispersed they are. I don't like manual saving because it makes a game easier, I like manual saving because it makes a game less repetitive- something that Manhunter wouldn't hurt to not have. It's INCREDIBLY frustrating when you step out for two seconds, accidentally get blown to smithereens by the enemies, then get teleported to fifteen minutes earlier in the game. It's the biggest leash-yanker in this game.\n\nI'd say this game is trying to make a commentary on triple-A FPS's like Call of Duty and Battlefield, by saying if their gameplay was the same as Manhunter, they'd be considered just as bad because of their poor stories. But, I think that's a bit too deep for anyone to get out of a game like this. Manhunter is a definite must-not-play. If you just bought this game and looked at my review, take my advice and refund it that very second! It is one of the worst games on Steam!","September 10, 2015","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/recommended/302250/","Skops","Skops","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Skops/","405 products in account","Developed by the Polish Studio 'Silden', Manhunter (or Sniper: The Manhunter) is a run 'n gun FPS game that I feel is misplaced on the PC platform. If this were something that I played on a tablet, I feel it would be a passable game! With the limited power of Ipads (or god forbid, a Blackberry Playbook) I might even go so far as to say the game looks pretty decent and is an overall good package... BUT I'm not reviewing a tablet FPS game, this is a PC FPS game and whats here is an extremely repetitive, poorly optimized, uninspired mess of a game.\n\n- Presentation: Graphically, I've seen worse. If you look at the screenshots you might catch yourself thinking it doesn't look half bad. That is because you haven't seen the game in motion. I admit, my 3 year old PC is far from a beast but I can still run Battlefield 4 on High at 50fps, meanwhile the FAR LESS graphically intensive Manhunter here struggles to stay at a consistent 30fps and has enough head bobbing to simutaniously give me a headache and motion sickness.\n\n- Animations: There is barely any. When switching weapons blink in and out and all making the same noise as the reload sound. Enemies/NPCs don't even have walking animations, everybody just jogs everywhere in the same fashion and sometimes in sync. Speaking of in sync, the grass that is scattered everywhere all move in a counter clockwise motion in complete syncronization and it looks REALLY WEIRD.\n\n- Sound: Weapons sound weak, they all sound exactly the same when reloading. The 'Combat Music' is not mixed at all; it hard cuts in, it hard cuts out. It even hard cut loops back to the beginning of the 12 second track if you stay in danger long enough. There 3 total "Combat Music" tracks , they suck, and you will hear them over and over, and over again. I eventually just turned on the Syphon Filter Omega Strain OST and continued playing, it was leaps and bounds better than the crap they had here.\n\n- Content: As far as I have seen, there is an abysmal 7 total weapons in the game (and thats including the knife, and grenades). You will be using the SMG, AK-47, and the sniper rifle for 98% of the game. There are some bits where you will use the .50 Barrett Rifle to take out a vehicle. There are 5 Chapters in the story, and 14 levels that fill out those chapters. It will likely take anyone, at maximum, a mere 2 hrs to completely get through the whole game. TWO. HOURS. MAXIMUM. There is no co-op or competitive multiplayer.\n\n- Story: There is literally no story here, just contract missions. Only two of the five chapters are connected in any way, and even then the resolution of that is unknown.\n\n- OVERALL: Manhunter is just a waste of time. It doesn't have anything good to show you, listen to, and no story to be had. I can't even recommend it as a 'so bad it's good' kind of game because there are worse games that try harder, cheaper, and most of all have some kind of a soul to them.\n\nShould ANYONE at all get curious in this game, wait until the price is $1.25 or lower to buy it.","September 29, 2014","false","7.1"," 37 of 46 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","37","46","3","0"

(also i played for about an hour on a friends copy.)\n\nCons:\n-controls are aweful, and i dont mean they arent bound well i mean the part about how the game feels clunky? i guess that'll do.\n\n-sniping from a helicopter is the first form of action, this happens far to often and as one can expect it sucks. i'd rather play nude whinny Raiden from Metal Gear 2.\n\n-aiming down sights is the only way to actually kill somethng half the time. also the AK is a nightmare to keep on target.\n\n-no way to turn off rediculous bobing.\n\n-stealth themed game with no decent stealth. the guns are supressed and can be heard clear cross the map at times, what's the point? either go loud or go stealth or even better do both! dont screw me by making the game seem like it has stealth elements.\n\n-im carrying 2 sniper rifles in the beging of the game... why? why do i have these? why dont i land with a carbine or something? that'd be useful.\n\n-the voice acting has no emotion, you could get more human reaction from keanu reeves in the Matrix franchise.\n\n-Max and John... could you use more cliche over used uncreative names?\n\n-first mission has john telling Max to give him guidance as well as what the mission was in the helecopter as they arrive at the drop zone. so there are a few problems here.\n1) is Max new? he seems like the guy who is supposed to give guidance in the first place.\n2) you should have covered this before getting in the helecopter.\n3) there is no exposition so who the hell are these people and why am i doing this?\n4) 1 million American dollars to blow up a facility? why? America could shoot it with a missle for that much.\n5) did i mention their names are Max and John?\n\n-where are we? when are we? Who are we? and Why are we? are not mentioned. how are we is kinda covered.\n\n-graphics are meh at best, though in all fairness this was not a tripple A game so i will let this slide.\n\n-game is short apparently it is about 4 hours long.\n\n-the voice acting!\n\nPros:\n\n-guns look okay even if they handle terribly\n\n-game plays... that's about it honestly it tears and has horrific frames, but it plays.\n\n-you start with a lot of ammo, this is always nice once in a while. i kinda get tired of those games where you can only carry 25-45 sniper rounds.\n\n-i didnt pay full price for this game it was part of a bundle .\n\n-uninstall works\n\n-the devs dont seem to be having a temper tantrum about negative reviews, so they might be listening to this.\n\n\nmy recomendation for the next game is to at least get Keanu Reeves.\n\n4/10 dont buy it even on sale.","November 10, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Is what I would say if I didn't have a brain. Manhunter is a game about you John Cullivan going and purging the middle east. You single handedly wipe out countless men for seemingly no reason other than you were told to and were promised a small amount of cash. Really there isn't a whole lot to say about this game. It's boring and will drain the will to live from your very body. Mix awful controls with bad gunplay and you have this game. And to stack onto that you have some ♥♥♥♥ poor AI at play as well. All of this together makes for an experience you won't soon be wanting to remember. Just keep your 5 dollars and go to subway or something, a footlong would last you longer than this game and would certainly be a better investment. 2/10 Don't get this game simple as that.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/302250/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","When I first took a look at "Manhunter" (around the time I purchased "Manhunt", oddly enough), I saw all the negative reviews that said all the same thing. "I stopped playing after the first ten minutes". Well, I'm glad to know YOUR habits, but what exactly about this game sucks? Well, everything, but that's beside the point. Wait, actually...\n\nThe first thing that sucks about this game would probably be everything. The sound is just standard gun sounds. Nothing special. The voice-acting is sub-par (Especially John's voice actor- and you hear him 90% of the game!). And the graphics literally want to look bad in this game. I kid you not! The game lags more than a Windows 95 trying to run a full Mincraft server with 64 people on it. And, to put things in perspective, I can play BioShock, Mass Effect 2, and The Old Republic on my computer just fine. No lag. No framerate issues. But this game is just... It's basically like a neurotic mother-in-law that can't make up her mind about anything? Will this level have a good framerate? ... No. Will this level have good sound? Sure! Will this level have clunky animation? Yes, to all of them!\n\nProbably the most noticeable flaw (the one, I assume, that turned off gamers after ten minutes into this game) is the walking. And jumping. And sprinting. And interacting with the world, really. It just all sucks. When John walks, it feels like he's walking on rubber legs and has to fling them out one at a time in order to properly move. When he jumps, it looks like he does a normal jump then out of nowhere, just farts and gets an extra boost on his jump. And John basically sprints like a fat kid during his first day at gym school. You can sprint for a total of... 5 meters. Or less. And then John will pant like a dog into your headphones for the next 30 seconds. Lovely. And the actual animations of the NPCs are just... unnerving. They move like programmed robots. Like Davies at the beginning of the game (and the *koff* "citizen" at the end of the game (even though it's just Davies again)) walks in cutscenes with his arms oddly spread out and pointing down. And enemies will die in unnatural manners, flinging in very specific directions after you snipe them.\n\nAnd you will snipe. A lot. I mean, if you're the only intelligent being in this game, you will snipe enough- since the only way to kill the waves of enemies fast enough it to hit them in the head, and the only gun that can do that properly is your sniper rifle. And the game seems to focus heavily on it's sniper rifles, since it'll give you TWO at the beginning of every stage and each one will be filled with TWO HUNDRED bullets. But the sniping (really just the shooting as a whole) is monotonous and uninspired. The game will show you the wind when you zoom in on your scope, but that only mattered once in the entire game when I had to snipe trucks... that would explode in one hit. But whenever you point your scope at an enemy the reticule that shows you where your bullet will hit and would be off to whatever direction the wind blows it, just happens to lock right on your enemy.\n\nThis game is all about walking, running, and sprinting. There is no variety or creative level design to pace out the experience more. And the story compliments it's perfectly by being the exact same thing. You'd think the game would end after you finally kill the RIGHT hit you were originally supposed to kill, or perhaps when you disable a ruddy bloody rocket! But the game just ambles on, and only ends when it feels it's padded itself to a long enough point. And I had no reason to care about the story of the characters. Max and John are the only main characters in the whole story and all their dialogue amounts to is-\nMAX: John, do this!\nJOHN: Roger that. (x500)\n\nWhat else sucks? Well, I did say everything, so what about the AI? Yeah, that sucks. Just like the game itself, the AI is programmed to be either "Stand here and keep shooting, and never take cover." Or "Flank John at the worst possible moment," because when I'd hang behind my cover for just about 7 seconds to heal (which takes forever to do in this game)- a random baddy would either spawn behind me or run around on my side and start shooting me. And I've even seen some enemies hide behind foliage, which I found oddly smart for the otherwise ignorate AI. And all your enemies are either Russians or Middle Easteners, so you already know the game's view on relationships with people outside their own country.\n\nThe music is also very limited. There are only two different tracks that play during shoot-outs and that's it. There is no music beyond that. And whenever you finish a shoot-out, the music will cut off awkwardly. And this isn't a glitch (even though this game is filled with those), because during the 5 hours I played this game- this would happen every time I killed the enemies in a room (which would be hilarious if I killed a guy in room, and the music would only pause for two seconds, as I'd open the door and new enemies would come out.)\n\nThe levels are very straightforward and pretty easy to grind through to get to where you want to get to. But the game is a bit too linear. If you deviate even a little from the course (or want to try swimming) you have 4 seconds to retrace your steps or you are screwed. And the save points in this game suck, because of how poorly dispersed they are. I don't like manual saving because it makes a game easier, I like manual saving because it makes a game less repetitive- something that Manhunter wouldn't hurt to not have. It's INCREDIBLY frustrating when you step out for two seconds, accidentally get blown to smithereens by the enemies, then get teleported to fifteen minutes earlier in the game. It's the biggest leash-yanker in this game.\n\nI'd say this game is trying to make a commentary on triple-A FPS's like Call of Duty and Battlefield, by saying if their gameplay was the same as Manhunter, they'd be considered just as bad because of their poor stories. But, I think that's a bit too deep for anyone to get out of a game like this. Manhunter is a definite must-not-play. If you just bought this game and looked at my review, take my advice and refund it that very second! It is one of the worst games on Steam!","September 10, 2015","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Anyway I gave the game a try cause I am such an idiot.\n\n\nNegative Points:\nStory\n- I think the story was made with some kind of "story generator" software. It is just so 0815 and boring, even a dead coyote can create a better storyline. The short story is a gift in this case!\n\nGraphics\n- Pretty bad. Something between vomit guarantee and eye cancer.\n\nSound\n- Weapon sounds are awful.\n\nBugs\n- The average bugs which appears in every game of this type like floating cars, glitching through object or getting stucked.\n- Also some game breaking bugs like random "Mission failed" bugs or the problem that the objectives dont get triggered.\n\nAnimations\n- Clunky, stupid, ugly!\n\nAI\n- The AI act completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- The spawn system works horrible and it happens very often that many enemies spawn at the exact same spot which can causes bugs. Also it looks ridiculous when suddenly a group of enemies just spawn in front of you - out of nowhere..\n- If you got your "AI friend" he will give a ♥♥♥♥ about you and he will shoot you into your back whenever you cross his fireline.. and of course this will damage you -_-\n- AI will detect/see you no matter what you are doing or where you are hiding.\n\nGame design\n- Boring linear levels. When you want to explore the level you will get the famous "get back or get killed" message..\n- Head bobbing cant be turned off - annoying!\n- The game want to focus on sniper combat huh? So have fun to rush into a skyscraper with your 2 snipers. As we all know, sniper rifles are the best weapons for close combat fights..\n- Only a few weapons. Assault rifles and SMGs are too weak anyway.\n- The cave levels are so ♥♥♥♥ing dark that you see nothing. Bad design choice.\n\n\n\nNeutral Points:\nNo Multiplayer\n- It's ok because it would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dead by now.\n\n\nPositive Points:\nNothing\n\n\n\nConclusionAnother boring shooter which got the same "quality level" as the old games from City Interactive (Terrorist Takedown series for example). This game got nothing special, nothing which let the game stand out from the crowd - just another cheap and brain-dead shooter.\nDo not buy it (even when it is on sale..)!","January 4","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/302250/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","When I first took a look at "Manhunter" (around the time I purchased "Manhunt", oddly enough), I saw all the negative reviews that said all the same thing. "I stopped playing after the first ten minutes". Well, I'm glad to know YOUR habits, but what exactly about this game sucks? Well, everything, but that's beside the point. Wait, actually...\n\nThe first thing that sucks about this game would probably be everything. The sound is just standard gun sounds. Nothing special. The voice-acting is sub-par (Especially John's voice actor- and you hear him 90% of the game!). And the graphics literally want to look bad in this game. I kid you not! The game lags more than a Windows 95 trying to run a full Mincraft server with 64 people on it. And, to put things in perspective, I can play BioShock, Mass Effect 2, and The Old Republic on my computer just fine. No lag. No framerate issues. But this game is just... It's basically like a neurotic mother-in-law that can't make up her mind about anything? Will this level have a good framerate? ... No. Will this level have good sound? Sure! Will this level have clunky animation? Yes, to all of them!\n\nProbably the most noticeable flaw (the one, I assume, that turned off gamers after ten minutes into this game) is the walking. And jumping. And sprinting. And interacting with the world, really. It just all sucks. When John walks, it feels like he's walking on rubber legs and has to fling them out one at a time in order to properly move. When he jumps, it looks like he does a normal jump then out of nowhere, just farts and gets an extra boost on his jump. And John basically sprints like a fat kid during his first day at gym school. You can sprint for a total of... 5 meters. Or less. And then John will pant like a dog into your headphones for the next 30 seconds. Lovely. And the actual animations of the NPCs are just... unnerving. They move like programmed robots. Like Davies at the beginning of the game (and the *koff* "citizen" at the end of the game (even though it's just Davies again)) walks in cutscenes with his arms oddly spread out and pointing down. And enemies will die in unnatural manners, flinging in very specific directions after you snipe them.\n\nAnd you will snipe. A lot. I mean, if you're the only intelligent being in this game, you will snipe enough- since the only way to kill the waves of enemies fast enough it to hit them in the head, and the only gun that can do that properly is your sniper rifle. And the game seems to focus heavily on it's sniper rifles, since it'll give you TWO at the beginning of every stage and each one will be filled with TWO HUNDRED bullets. But the sniping (really just the shooting as a whole) is monotonous and uninspired. The game will show you the wind when you zoom in on your scope, but that only mattered once in the entire game when I had to snipe trucks... that would explode in one hit. But whenever you point your scope at an enemy the reticule that shows you where your bullet will hit and would be off to whatever direction the wind blows it, just happens to lock right on your enemy.\n\nThis game is all about walking, running, and sprinting. There is no variety or creative level design to pace out the experience more. And the story compliments it's perfectly by being the exact same thing. You'd think the game would end after you finally kill the RIGHT hit you were originally supposed to kill, or perhaps when you disable a ruddy bloody rocket! But the game just ambles on, and only ends when it feels it's padded itself to a long enough point. And I had no reason to care about the story of the characters. Max and John are the only main characters in the whole story and all their dialogue amounts to is-\nMAX: John, do this!\nJOHN: Roger that. (x500)\n\nWhat else sucks? Well, I did say everything, so what about the AI? Yeah, that sucks. Just like the game itself, the AI is programmed to be either "Stand here and keep shooting, and never take cover." Or "Flank John at the worst possible moment," because when I'd hang behind my cover for just about 7 seconds to heal (which takes forever to do in this game)- a random baddy would either spawn behind me or run around on my side and start shooting me. And I've even seen some enemies hide behind foliage, which I found oddly smart for the otherwise ignorate AI. And all your enemies are either Russians or Middle Easteners, so you already know the game's view on relationships with people outside their own country.\n\nThe music is also very limited. There are only two different tracks that play during shoot-outs and that's it. There is no music beyond that. And whenever you finish a shoot-out, the music will cut off awkwardly. And this isn't a glitch (even though this game is filled with those), because during the 5 hours I played this game- this would happen every time I killed the enemies in a room (which would be hilarious if I killed a guy in room, and the music would only pause for two seconds, as I'd open the door and new enemies would come out.)\n\nThe levels are very straightforward and pretty easy to grind through to get to where you want to get to.

But, I think that's a bit too deep for anyone to get out of a game like this. Manhunter is a definite must-not-play.

I'm not sure if it was a student project or just a really underfunded studio, but this game probably shouldn't have been released. It's not fun, the story is mediocre, and the AI is among the worst I've ever seen. As fas as I can gather, this game is about a Merc-wannabe and his useless sidekick that manage to botch the jobs they accept. Levels are generally just plowing headlong into enemies until there aren't anymore enemies, then finding more enemies to make fewer of... It asks you to stealth some parts, but I'm not sure stealth is an actual option. The enemies tend to just know you're there, so they poke their heads out and wait for you to either make them fall over, or you fall over yourself. There's no excitement at all anywhere.\n\nAlso, the birds are broken. Instead of flying, birds are stuck in one spot in the air.

The AI in this game is comparable to a person with Down Syndrome. They'll literally just stand in 1 place & fire @ you. Climbing ladders in this game is a nightmare. The mechanic is just so sketchy & broken.\n\nPlease don't buy this game. It's terrible. It has no redeeming qualities.\n","June 10, 2014","false","1.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

Most of them were poorly made....but they still had a certain charm to them....kind of like all of the killer shark movies that the 'SyFy' channel has begun to crank out on a yearly basis. The games were very basic....but they worked....which is more than "Manhunter" can claim. When you start the first mission....there is some spoken dialogue that is supposed to give you some insight into what you are supposed to be doing....but there is some sh***y Iranian orchestra music blaring which drowns everything else out. You start off in a helicopter and are supposed to be sniping some targets from the air....but good luck with that. But at least you seem to be invulnerable while in the air....'cause I kept getting shot over an over and nothing happened. After a couple of minutes of this bullsh**....the helicopter finally lands and as soon as your feet touch the ground....you will know just how broken the game actually is. First up....the walking. Your character walks like he is riding a pi**ed off bull....and you have to somehow hold on for eight seconds.  More annoying than that.....is the jumping. This game has the exact same gravity as The Moon. You can jump high and float in the air for several seconds. Want to jump rooftop to rooftop? Well guess what....you can. Just keep in mind that if you cross any invisible barriers in your travels....the game will give you a few seconds to get back before it makes you start all over. Which is something that you may have to do often.....since when I followed my A.I. teammate towards a hill.....the game demanded that I stay on track....before ultimately informing me that I failed the mission. The music is terrible and can not be turned off. Sure.....there is an option to do so in the main menu....but it doesn't work. The weapon selection is bewildering to say the least. You start the first mission with a silenced pistol....a sniper rifle....and um.....another sniper rifle. You can pick up AK-47's from enemy soldiers....which kind of made me feel like the Doom Marine for a second....since that was pretty much the last time that I remembered carrying a huge surplus of weapons in a FPS. This game has absolutely nothing going for it....and it's not even good in a bad kind of way.","March 14","false","0.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","80","12","15","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/recommended/302250/","kschang77","kschang77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kschang77/","993 products in account","SUMMARY: Manhunter, previously known as "Sniper: the Manhunter" is a game featuring a mercenary who will take out targets if he deemed they are worth killing. However, sometimes he's just a pawn in the mess. The game felt as if it's an old game designed 8 years ago (circa 2006 or so) albeit updated to modern graphics, where you are basically Rambo that will mow down everybody in his way, using long guns, assault rifles, and even pistols, shooting down generic enemies in various interesting locations.  At the end, there are better FPS that are worth your money.\n\nI am seeing a lot of people confusing this with the old Sierra "Manhunter" franchise. This has NOTHING to do with that. This is basically one guy shooting bazillion bad guys FPS, sort of Modern Warfare without the cut scenes, QT events, or "AI Teammates" to get in your way. However, no multiplayer either.\n\nAs typical in FPSs back then, you carry a veritable arsenal... Two sniper rifles, pistol, then as you encounter them, AK-47 assault rifles and  PDW submachine guns. The pistol and your primary sniper rifle are suppressed, but not silenced, so you can be discovered while using it. And most enemies require multiple taps on a single target except the primary sniper rifle and the .50 cal sniper rifle.   No shotgun here.\n\nThe game basically has you fight your way into the objective, to setup a sniper nest or to simply clear the area and achieve the objective, which is, often, snipe a high-value target, and sometimes, to rescue one. Your only link to outside is "Max" your handler who through wonders of technology, will provide you some guidance.\n\nAt least the locations are somewhat exotic. I haven't seen any levels set in what's allegedly Moscow (though it looks generic enough), or the Baikinour Cosmodrome (probably NOT accurate).\n\nEnemies are generic and really reminds me of old Lithtech games like "Marine Sharpshooter". They don't really flank, but more like ran back and forth at range, with occasionally rushes but the level is typically wide enough that you can find cover and backup around the corner and keep trying.\n\nThere are various talk about stealth, but in reality you can just kill everybody you need to. There's no health meter, as your health auto-regenerate, at least on easy level. If you hide behind sometime and stop taking hits you'll recover in a few seconds. It's when you take hits non-stop that you will die.\n\nWhile the level appears to be wide open, there are serious boundaries that you will not cross, or a huge timer will start counting down where you have 10 seconds to get back to the "proper" area or the mission fails. There are also various houses, walls, and such that limits your movement. And that gets really annoying.\n\nAll in all, this game is worth merely a few dollars, no more. It's a quick distraction budget title, don't expect too much. You can probably find better shooters even at this low pricepoint.","August 9, 2014","false","6.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

I can't believe how realistic it is, it's just how I would expect killing people to be.\n\nThe graphics are simply amazing, being able to turn On/Off Birds in the graphical settings is an absolute must have feature, and it blew my mind away to see that these developers implemented it. Animations are probably some of the best I have ever seen in a FPS, absolutely amazing!\n\nIt was even realistic right down to leaving the game! The game tried to stay open in the background, most likely attempting to lure me back into the warzone. I needed to leave it for the night, so I closed it via the task manager and it crashed my computer! I can't believe how awesome it was, it knew that I had to go to sleep and it completely crashed my PC.\n\nI r8 8/8 while I masturb8.\n\n/SSSSSSSSSSSSSARCASM\n\nPlease don't buy this game, for the sake of your mental health...

I am going to get plenty of singleplayer play time on this. Please note that it does lag when it saves and  the character's mouths don't move when they talk. If the mouths moved this would make it a more realistic type of game. It does have cutscenes after you get intel on the latest missions and after you kill the last guy in that area of the map.

If you get it cheap, go for it game is fun. Still playing it, have not quite finished, almost 9 hrs of playtime so far i think it's worth it. Oh almost forgot. I love sniping.

Yes it is a run and gun shooter, however it still has a good and believeable story line to it.\n\nThe graphics are really not that bad and it runs quite smooth on my machine, again remember you are only paying $5.60 Canadian dollars for this game.\n\nIt reminds me of "I'M GOING IN" with the character "Davy Jones"  (the original first one-which was the best one). The guns are realistic and work (react) just like they do in real life,\n\nMy computer specs are: Windows 7 Professional (64 Bit-Service Pack 1), Intel Core i7-4770K, CPU @ 3.50 GHz, Dual Quad Core, 16 Gigs of DDR-3 RAM, GeForce GTX 770 (Memory-2048 MB - GDDR5), Sound Blaster ZxR Sound Card.\n\nIt is not the best or most modern FPS out there graphic wise, but to tell you the truth it is most certainly not the worse either. However, for the price it is a pretty good game, really fun to play and not as short as some people have been saying. It is actually quite long with lots of twists and turns.\n\nWould I recommend that people buy this game, YES I would definitely recommend that people buy this game even though it is not the best FPS available, it is still lots of fun.\n\nI hope this helps some people when they are trying to decide whether they should spend $5.60 Canadian dollars for this game or not.\n\nTake Care & Stay Safe,\n\nCANADA\n\n:-)","July 31, 2014","true","8.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","38","5","13","0","6"

Max is your stereotypical video game soldier with an australian accent. The voice acting is monotone and emotionless. Speaking of characters, in cutscenes the characters waddle like they have been holding a gran caca for several months. The pelvis doesn't even move. And the arms stay bent, and move back in forward ever so slowly.\n\nAs for the gameplay. If you are killed and restart the dialogue starts up before the game loads. Combat is wonky. A pistol is even better than an AK47. Also, for some parts of the game you can sprint, and as you sprint the enemies spawn and won't attack until they run to their scripted spawn. You can literally run straight up to them and knife them. And speaking of sprinting; your character can sprint for about 3 seconds (if that), and will then proceed to pant and heave like a group of apathetic middle schoolers forced to run the mile in P.E. Wait another 5-7 seconds and you can sprint again. Here's a positive: you never need to worry about knowing if you killed all the enemies, because as they spawn in cheap garage band rock- may I add in looping (not kidding, you can hear the break inbetween the loops - will start playing, and once all of them die it will stop. So you run up, music spawns, kill 3 enemies, music stops, turn a corner and the cycle repeats. Another fun fact is that it took a whole clip of AK47 ammo to blow up 1- I repeat, ONE- red/explosive barrel. To make matters worse you are given unskippable cutscenes with bland, overly-generic/sterotypical military dialogue.\n\nSo I finished the first mission (so I believe) and at the end (SPOILER- though not really b/c it affects the game in no way whatsoever) the person you supposed to find is dead. And in an emotionless, australian accent Max says "He's dead. We were too late." Meanwhile your NPC ally is outside, and replies "I found a map." You go out to see him staring into the distance, no map around, no objective around, nothing. After 1 minute of looking for a stupid map or trigger to continue the game, I gave up.\n\nIf you already bought this game, I say in the words of the legendary, unique, unforgetable Max's words "I was too late."\nI bought this on sale, it was around $.50-$1.50.

(also i played for about an hour on a friends copy.)\n\nCons:\n-controls are aweful, and i dont mean they arent bound well i mean the part about how the game feels clunky? i guess that'll do.\n\n-sniping from a helicopter is the first form of action, this happens far to often and as one can expect it sucks. i'd rather play nude whinny Raiden from Metal Gear 2.\n\n-aiming down sights is the only way to actually kill somethng half the time. also the AK is a nightmare to keep on target.\n\n-no way to turn off rediculous bobing.\n\n-stealth themed game with no decent stealth. the guns are supressed and can be heard clear cross the map at times, what's the point? either go loud or go stealth or even better do both! dont screw me by making the game seem like it has stealth elements.\n\n-im carrying 2 sniper rifles in the beging of the game... why? why do i have these? why dont i land with a carbine or something? that'd be useful.\n\n-the voice acting has no emotion, you could get more human reaction from keanu reeves in the Matrix franchise.\n\n-Max and John... could you use more cliche over used uncreative names?\n\n-first mission has john telling Max to give him guidance as well as what the mission was in the helecopter as they arrive at the drop zone. so there are a few problems here.\n1) is Max new? he seems like the guy who is supposed to give guidance in the first place.\n2) you should have covered this before getting in the helecopter.\n3) there is no exposition so who the hell are these people and why am i doing this?\n4) 1 million American dollars to blow up a facility? why? America could shoot it with a missle for that much.\n5) did i mention their names are Max and John?\n\n-where are we? when are we? Who are we? and Why are we? are not mentioned. how are we is kinda covered.\n\n-graphics are meh at best, though in all fairness this was not a tripple A game so i will let this slide.\n\n-game is short apparently it is about 4 hours long.\n\n-the voice acting!\n\nPros:\n\n-guns look okay even if they handle terribly\n\n-game plays... that's about it honestly it tears and has horrific frames, but it plays.\n\n-you start with a lot of ammo, this is always nice once in a while. i kinda get tired of those games where you can only carry 25-45 sniper rounds.\n\n-i didnt pay full price for this game it was part of a bundle .\n\n-uninstall works\n\n-the devs dont seem to be having a temper tantrum about negative reviews, so they might be listening to this.\n\n\nmy recomendation for the next game is to at least get Keanu Reeves.\n\n4/10 dont buy it even on sale.","November 10, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Max is your stereotypical video game soldier with an australian accent. The voice acting is monotone and emotionless. Speaking of characters, in cutscenes the characters waddle like they have been holding a gran caca for several months. The pelvis doesn't even move. And the arms stay bent, and move back in forward ever so slowly.\n\nAs for the gameplay. If you are killed and restart the dialogue starts up before the game loads. Combat is wonky. A pistol is even better than an AK47. Also, for some parts of the game you can sprint, and as you sprint the enemies spawn and won't attack until they run to their scripted spawn. You can literally run straight up to them and knife them. And speaking of sprinting; your character can sprint for about 3 seconds (if that), and will then proceed to pant and heave like a group of apathetic middle schoolers forced to run the mile in P.E. Wait another 5-7 seconds and you can sprint again. Here's a positive: you never need to worry about knowing if you killed all the enemies, because as they spawn in cheap garage band rock- may I add in looping (not kidding, you can hear the break inbetween the loops - will start playing, and once all of them die it will stop. So you run up, music spawns, kill 3 enemies, music stops, turn a corner and the cycle repeats. Another fun fact is that it took a whole clip of AK47 ammo to blow up 1- I repeat, ONE- red/explosive barrel. To make matters worse you are given unskippable cutscenes with bland, overly-generic/sterotypical military dialogue.\n\nSo I finished the first mission (so I believe) and at the end (SPOILER- though not really b/c it affects the game in no way whatsoever) the person you supposed to find is dead. And in an emotionless, australian accent Max says "He's dead. We were too late." Meanwhile your NPC ally is outside, and replies "I found a map." You go out to see him staring into the distance, no map around, no objective around, nothing. After 1 minute of looking for a stupid map or trigger to continue the game, I gave up.\n\nIf you already bought this game, I say in the words of the legendary, unique, unforgetable Max's words "I was too late."\nI bought this on sale, it was around $.50-$1.50.

America could shoot it with a missle for that much.\n5) did i mention their names are Max and John?\n\n-where are we? when are we? Who are we? and Why are we? are not mentioned. how are we is kinda covered.\n\n-graphics are meh at best, though in all fairness this was not a tripple A game so i will let this slide.\n\n-game is short apparently it is about 4 hours long.\n\n-the voice acting!\n\nPros:\n\n-guns look okay even if they handle terribly\n\n-game plays... that's about it honestly it tears and has horrific frames, but it plays.\n\n-you start with a lot of ammo, this is always nice once in a while. i kinda get tired of those games where you can only carry 25-45 sniper rounds.\n\n-i didnt pay full price for this game it was part of a bundle .\n\n-uninstall works\n\n-the devs dont seem to be having a temper tantrum about negative reviews, so they might be listening to this.\n\n\nmy recomendation for the next game is to at least get Keanu Reeves.\n\n4/10 dont buy it even on sale.","November 10, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/302250/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","When I first took a look at "Manhunter" (around the time I purchased "Manhunt", oddly enough), I saw all the negative reviews that said all the same thing. "I stopped playing after the first ten minutes". Well, I'm glad to know YOUR habits, but what exactly about this game sucks? Well, everything, but that's beside the point. Wait, actually...\n\nThe first thing that sucks about this game would probably be everything. The sound is just standard gun sounds. Nothing special. The voice-acting is sub-par (Especially John's voice actor- and you hear him 90% of the game!). And the graphics literally want to look bad in this game. I kid you not! The game lags more than a Windows 95 trying to run a full Mincraft server with 64 people on it. And, to put things in perspective, I can play BioShock, Mass Effect 2, and The Old Republic on my computer just fine. No lag. No framerate issues. But this game is just... It's basically like a neurotic mother-in-law that can't make up her mind about anything? Will this level have a good framerate? ... No. Will this level have good sound? Sure! Will this level have clunky animation? Yes, to all of them!\n\nProbably the most noticeable flaw (the one, I assume, that turned off gamers after ten minutes into this game) is the walking. And jumping. And sprinting. And interacting with the world, really. It just all sucks. When John walks, it feels like he's walking on rubber legs and has to fling them out one at a time in order to properly move. When he jumps, it looks like he does a normal jump then out of nowhere, just farts and gets an extra boost on his jump. And John basically sprints like a fat kid during his first day at gym school. You can sprint for a total of... 5 meters. Or less. And then John will pant like a dog into your headphones for the next 30 seconds. Lovely. And the actual animations of the NPCs are just... unnerving. They move like programmed robots. Like Davies at the beginning of the game (and the *koff* "citizen" at the end of the game (even though it's just Davies again)) walks in cutscenes with his arms oddly spread out and pointing down. And enemies will die in unnatural manners, flinging in very specific directions after you snipe them.\n\nAnd you will snipe. A lot. I mean, if you're the only intelligent being in this game, you will snipe enough- since the only way to kill the waves of enemies fast enough it to hit them in the head, and the only gun that can do that properly is your sniper rifle. And the game seems to focus heavily on it's sniper rifles, since it'll give you TWO at the beginning of every stage and each one will be filled with TWO HUNDRED bullets. But the sniping (really just the shooting as a whole) is monotonous and uninspired. The game will show you the wind when you zoom in on your scope, but that only mattered once in the entire game when I had to snipe trucks... that would explode in one hit. But whenever you point your scope at an enemy the reticule that shows you where your bullet will hit and would be off to whatever direction the wind blows it, just happens to lock right on your enemy.\n\nThis game is all about walking, running, and sprinting. There is no variety or creative level design to pace out the experience more. And the story compliments it's perfectly by being the exact same thing. You'd think the game would end after you finally kill the RIGHT hit you were originally supposed to kill, or perhaps when you disable a ruddy bloody rocket! But the game just ambles on, and only ends when it feels it's padded itself to a long enough point. And I had no reason to care about the story of the characters. Max and John are the only main characters in the whole story and all their dialogue amounts to is-\nMAX: John, do this!\nJOHN: Roger that. (x500)\n\nWhat else sucks? Well, I did say everything, so what about the AI? Yeah, that sucks. Just like the game itself, the AI is programmed to be either "Stand here and keep shooting, and never take cover." Or "Flank John at the worst possible moment," because when I'd hang behind my cover for just about 7 seconds to heal (which takes forever to do in this game)- a random baddy would either spawn behind me or run around on my side and start shooting me. And I've even seen some enemies hide behind foliage, which I found oddly smart for the otherwise ignorate AI. And all your enemies are either Russians or Middle Easteners, so you already know the game's view on relationships with people outside their own country.\n\nThe music is also very limited. There are only two different tracks that play during shoot-outs and that's it. There is no music beyond that. And whenever you finish a shoot-out, the music will cut off awkwardly. And this isn't a glitch (even though this game is filled with those), because during the 5 hours I played this game- this would happen every time I killed the enemies in a room (which would be hilarious if I killed a guy in room, and the music would only pause for two seconds, as I'd open the door and new enemies would come out.)\n\nThe levels are very straightforward and pretty easy to grind through to get to where you want to get to. But the game is a bit too linear. If you deviate even a little from the course (or want to try swimming) you have 4 seconds to retrace your steps or you are screwed. And the save points in this game suck, because of how poorly dispersed they are. I don't like manual saving because it makes a game easier, I like manual saving because it makes a game less repetitive- something that Manhunter wouldn't hurt to not have. It's INCREDIBLY frustrating when you step out for two seconds, accidentally get blown to smithereens by the enemies, then get teleported to fifteen minutes earlier in the game. It's the biggest leash-yanker in this game.\n\nI'd say this game is trying to make a commentary on triple-A FPS's like Call of Duty and Battlefield, by saying if their gameplay was the same as Manhunter, they'd be considered just as bad because of their poor stories. But, I think that's a bit too deep for anyone to get out of a game like this. Manhunter is a definite must-not-play. If you just bought this game and looked at my review, take my advice and refund it that very second! It is one of the worst games on Steam!","September 10, 2015","false","5.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Something between vomit guarantee and eye cancer.\n\nSound\n- Weapon sounds are awful.\n\nBugs\n- The average bugs which appears in every game of this type like floating cars, glitching through object or getting stucked.\n- Also some game breaking bugs like random "Mission failed" bugs or the problem that the objectives dont get triggered.\n\nAnimations\n- Clunky, stupid, ugly!\n\nAI\n- The AI act completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\n- The spawn system works horrible and it happens very often that many enemies spawn at the exact same spot which can causes bugs. Also it looks ridiculous when suddenly a group of enemies just spawn in front of you - out of nowhere..\n- If you got your "AI friend" he will give a ♥♥♥♥ about you and he will shoot you into your back whenever you cross his fireline.. and of course this will damage you -_-\n- AI will detect/see you no matter what you are doing or where you are hiding.\n\nGame design\n- Boring linear levels. When you want to explore the level you will get the famous "get back or get killed" message..\n- Head bobbing cant be turned off - annoying!\n- The game want to focus on sniper combat huh? So have fun to rush into a skyscraper with your 2 snipers. As we all know, sniper rifles are the best weapons for close combat fights..\n- Only a few weapons. Assault rifles and SMGs are too weak anyway.\n- The cave levels are so ♥♥♥♥ing dark that you see nothing. Bad design choice.\n\n\n\nNeutral Points:\nNo Multiplayer\n- It's ok because it would be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and dead by now.\n\n\nPositive Points:\nNothing\n\n\n\nConclusionAnother boring shooter which got the same "quality level" as the old games from City Interactive (Terrorist Takedown series for example). This game got nothing special, nothing which let the game stand out from the crowd - just another cheap and brain-dead shooter.\nDo not buy it (even when it is on sale..)!","January 4","false","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It wasn't too bad... it just wasn't very good. If you are looking for a game with even the slightest bit of strategy, this isn't for you. But if you are lloking for a game in which you just click on the enemies 'till they die, then this is for you. Over all, this game was OK, even a little fun for a while, so I do reccomend.","March 28","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It isn't great, but neither is it the worst out there.  I think it would still be worth a play through if you like shooters and can get  it on a weekend deal for a couple of bucks.\n\nHowever, I really can't recommend it even for a buck or two, because of the strange head-bobbing movement that can't be shut off.\n\nThis extremely unrealistic bobbing motion, combined with the non-adjustable and  too-narrow FOV, makes me want to puke-- literally.\n\nI don't think I've ever felt nauseous from a game before, but this one makes me feel like blowing chunks after a few minutes.","April 18","false","0.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
